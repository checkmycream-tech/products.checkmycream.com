<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product has a nice smell but a little &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; in container. Just scoop out a little bit, and it melts quickly with heat of hands. It is amazing how soft my hands are after using this product. I bought two containers for a relative with a bad case of eczema and it has already begun helping to soften and clear the area. Had one container sent to me, and I really like it. I use it on my face and scalp. Also makes my hair super controllable and soft. A really great product!</li>
    <li> Melts great and whipped up well for my homemade body butter.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Quick shipping.  Very happy all around.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the past week, making different lotions/creams. Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to make body and facial cream.  It blended well with coconut and almond oil.  I don&#x27;t like the smell too much (I tried to mask it with essential oils), but I do enjoy how it feels on my skin.  I just started using the cream and it is too soon to tell if it will replace my current beauty products.</li>
    <li> My skin is softer than its been in years. I will be ordering more shortly. Last I checked it was sold out.</li>
    <li> This product is good quality, it is just not the most convenient form in which to use.  The cake is pretty hard, and it does not spread easily.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using just shea butter as a moisturizer.  A friend has told me that shea butter is a very good moisturizer. The item came as a solid block which was a surprise as I expected it to be in a softer form, like a cream. After using it for a few days, my skin felt better especially my fingertips. Before using the shea butter, they were very dry and felt scratchy like sandpaper. I have tried other oils and lotions but they didn&#x27;t work. After using shea butter, they are now back to normal, soft and smooth. Another area that was healed is the outer edge of my left foot. It was splitting from dryness and was painful. After applying shea butter for several days,  the pain was gone and the area does not feel as dry. There is a smoky, nutty smell when first applied but the smell disappears after a while. It is easily absorbed and there is no oily residue. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is having to melt it by rubbing it between my hands before I can apply it. Otherwise I wish I had known about this shea butter earlier and I love it!</li>
    <li> The Shea butter itself is great. It is very easy to get out with a spoon and great alone. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good so I use essential oils with it. You only need a small amount. The container was damaged when I received it (NOT in shipping). It looked like someone squeezed the container too hard. Thankfully everything else was in its own protective packaging because she&#x27;s butter was EVERYWHERE!</li>
    <li> Love this she a butter it works great when mixed with oils for all kinds of potions and lotions!</li>
    <li> Love this product! The container is huge and you only need to use very little of the product. this will last me forever:)</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  This Shea butter works.  I have really dry skin and after two weeks it has helped with the dryness and I don&#x27;t itch anymore.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Does leave some oily residue other than that it works great and quickly absorbs into my thirsty skin.</li>
    <li> Again, this is the best Shea butter for me. Soooooo glad I got it right the first time after reading other reviews.  Just received my second container because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  The Shea butter hair conditioner I made is THE BEST moisturizing product for my naturally kinky new growth with relaxed hair blend. Did not want to do the  &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34;  and wear a tween weeny afro, so finding a product that would minimize breakage was critical. Tried the natural hair route about 3 years ago  but gave up on it because my hair was so dry!!!  A hair stylist I was going to, who was supposed to be very knowledgeable about the process, told me &amp;#34;you don&#x27;t need any other products.  The natural oil from your scalp will do the conditioning&amp;#34;. Well, it didn&#x27;t happen. When I quizzed her a few times about what products to use she became irritated, then I became annoyed and decided to never go back.  This time around though my new growth is SOFTER and GROWING!!! I  definitely see myself wearing natural curls from a braid-out for a long time to come because this butter moisturizes the hair so well. WONDERFUL PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle worker! I use it on my son&#x27;s eczema, and almost instantly it was cleared up. Highly recommend for eczema and dry skin!</li>
    <li> First time ordered Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice shea butter.  I have used it several times and seems to be a good quality product.  The color is neutral - neither yellow nor white - which is fine for my purposes.  I am using it as a base in a skin blend with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I put some butter on my dry skin and did not see any result.</li>
    <li> You skin never feels so good....</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It makes me look brighter and health skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is very nice!  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> Shea butter is one my favorite ingredient for skin care. This is my second tub of shea butter and I had used other brand before. I don’t feel much difference between the products and I love using it. I soften it by rubbing gently and it goes on my skin very smooth and stays very good. I use it on any dry spots and especially on my hand. It’s a good size tub and will last for a while. I’ve only used it raw and it works fine for me.</li>
    <li> excellent, no complaints</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it to make my own lotion. It is great! My tub was a little cracked when i got it but it did not damage the product at all.</li>
    <li> this shea butter is very hard and has to be microwaved to soften in order to apply it other then that the product does work for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, perfect in my body cream!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My cracked heals love this. Smells great. High purity is obvious. I will definitely buy again. Great on all dry areas and stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Just start to use this product and I feel confident about it. Already.</li>
    <li> The BEST Shea Butter ever. My skin feels awesome!</li>
    <li> Use this on my kids ruff knees and so far works great it is a very hard product but still works good</li>
    <li> At first I wanted to make my homemade tinted lip balm. After I purchased this I also received a SHEA BUTTER EBOOK, so I made some moisturazer and shampoo from the EBOOK. Oh, I have to mention the Shea butter shampoo I made. My toddler scalp has eczema and has plenty of dandruff after washing hair. After my toddler use this homemade shampoo, I notice he has no more dandruff. And I know there is no content of chemical in the shampoo. I am going to made aloe Vera Shea butter lotion next time.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but for this I just had to- this Shea Butter is amazing!! My 2 year old has very dry and sensitive skin. We&#x27;ve tried everything including other brands of shea butter- I don&#x27;t like but anything toxic on her so I figured I&#x27;d try this shea butter and so glad I did! Within 2 applications her red, dry, itchy skin was smooth and soft again!!! It&#x27;s amazing and I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome. I use it to make all kinds of things and it whips up easily. My whole body is softer including my hair. Came in a nice tub for easy storage. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is great quality. I purchased the ivory which I like a lot more than the yellow which tends to make me itch. The texture is soft and smooth making it easy to manipulate and the e-book was everything! Countless recipes. I already make shea butter body products but now the possibilities seem endless. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Use this on newborn baby for dry skin really makes a different</li>
    <li> Worked beautifully on my cracked heals. This is the only thing that has worked so far and I have tried EVERYTHING!</li>
    <li> Great product. My friend has been telling me to get this for years. I finally ordered and I&#x27;m loving it too. It melts in my hands &amp; is easy to apply. Feels a little sticky at first, then it absorbs &amp; my skin feels super soft. Especially great on feet!</li>
    <li> I use lots of shea in lotions bars and soap this is great. Great fragrance and great purchase.</li>
    <li> This product is just how I expected it to be.  It is well packaged and a nice texture.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> This was a very recent purchase. The 4 rating is only because I have not had a long experience with the product. So far it has been VERY pleasant to use. I notice not grittiness in it and it has been a really nice addition to the combination of FCO and essential oils used for a nightly backrub. I look forward to using it in more applications. Great service and the product seems to be a very good value.</li>
    <li> Blended it with organic coconut oil to make a wonderful body lotion.  I can already see a clear&lt;br /&gt;difference in my skin.  Soft and smooth. Thank you !  Great product !</li>
    <li> Smell - nutty, but definitely not rancid.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - nicely resealable container (like the plastic cylindrical ones chinese restaurants use), came on time.&lt;br /&gt;Texture - Smooth, no grainy residue like some other brands&lt;br /&gt;Works as advertised with a competitive price.  Zero.  Negatives.</li>
    <li> My experience with this product was not so great.  I have very sensitive skin.  After using this product on my face for two days, I started experiencing light burning and small breakouts were appearing on my face (cheeks, upper lip and forehead).  There was no negative reaction when I had applied this product to my neck area.  I&#x27;m not saying that this is a bad product, because everyone&#x27;s experience will always differ from one another.  I decided to discontinue use of this product for right now.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t give the product enough time to work properly.  I know that when you are changing skin care products, your own skin needs enough time to adjust and breakouts can appear and that in time, consistent use of a product, the breakouts will eventually go away.  I guess I just didn&#x27;t want to go through the adjustment.  The product does work ok on my body.</li>
    <li> This product is outstanding!  It really improves appearance and texture of the skin, absorbs well, not greasy as some may think.  Good for hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> From the customer service to the product itself I am 100% satisfied. I wish the seller had a store front near me because I would be in there all the time. The product was perfect and exactly as described I was not disappointed. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I have tried different shea butter from different companies.  This product is the best of the bunch.  I appreciate how smoothly this product goes on, and keeps my hands soft for hours.  At night, lather your hands in it, put on cotton gloves, and wear them while you sleep.  You&#x27;ll wake up with soft, smooth skin.  I use it to help treat my eczema break outs.  It&#x27;s a very soothing product.  Yes, the smell is not pleasant, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.  The quality of the product for the price is excellent.</li>
    <li> Loved It... It was very good value and true to price!</li>
    <li> Does the job. I use it for my growing belly to help with itching and (hopefully) control stretch marks. Very nutty smell. But subsides after a while. Leaves behind soft, smooth, healthy looking skin.  I also use it for my natural hair.  Great moisture boost and helps prevent breakage!</li>
    <li> Excellent choice for dry skin</li>
    <li> I do like the company, Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice, because they sent me a free DIY recipe e-book with tons of recipes for lips, hair, and skin treatments.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find lots of uses for the shea butter.  Currently I use it on my psoriasis and the red, scaly, itchy areas are clearing up nicely!  no more itching which is so great.  I intend to use it longterm as I like the results I am already seeing (also it is gentler and more natural than topical steroids).  I also use it on my 1 year old who has itchy eczema.  Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this quality product.</li>
    <li> very good and supple on the skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THAT IT LAST ALL DAY.</li>
    <li> This is authentic, lives up to it&#x27;s claims.  I will purchase it again and again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and very high quality!</li>
    <li> One of the best Shea Butters I have tried. I got the ivory and am very impressed. I have used this on my daughter face. She has very dry skin and it worked great and was not overly greasy.  I used it on my natural hair as a seal and it worked well. One of my HG products!</li>
    <li> Great product but only weighs 13.9 oz in the container. It does not weigh a pound. Dishonest seller.</li>
    <li> I love Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice for Shea Butter. Great product and quality. It leaves my skin so soft and I receive compliments on how soft my skin is all the time. It is a bit greasy, but it works better than lotion for me.</li>
    <li> I like this.  I melted some and mixed in a bit of olive oil then whipped it.  It makes a seriously thick body cream.</li>
    <li> Nice shea butter.  It works well and as described.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for only a couple of weeks now, but I absolutely love it!!!! It&#x27;s not grainy or greasy.  I mix it with a bit of essential oil or with my lovely-smelling lotion, in order to improve the scent a bit, for all over body bliss! It has made my skin even softer than it already was!</li>
    <li> This was the only thing that helped my daughter&#x27;s eczema and we tried everything! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this product to make whipped body butter, sunscreen and face lotion and it is wonderful! After my purchase, I received an email with a recipe book for additional products to make.  Will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> First experience with shea butter and with this company, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! This will always be my choice for shea butter going forward.</li>
    <li> This is amazing for making lotions, sunscreen, and lipbalm.  It barely has a fragrance, so it is easy to personalize.  The tub is large, and the possibilities are endless using the e-book that came with the product!</li>
    <li> I really like this shea butter.  Since it&#x27;s all organic shea butter and not processed with a lot of fillers to make it extra creamy and soft, I know exactly what I&#x27;m getting and know it&#x27;s good for my skin.  It works great when I&#x27;ve been wearing sandals and my heels need extra help or on dry winter skin.  I&#x27;ve even mixed it with organic coconut oil and used it that way for a creamier consistency.</li>
    <li> My experience has been that this is a &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; version of the yellow shea butter. It seems to me to be a bit smoother and lighter, so I&#x27;m using it as my summer shea butter and the yellow one as my winter alternative. Also, becuase I find it lighter, I prefer it for my face, especially in summer. It has no scent that I can detect which I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will like, and it&#x27;s fine obviously, but I actually love the earthy nutty smell of the yellow version. It is very moisturizing and I love the whole 100% natural and organic fair trade thing. That&#x27;s very important to me. If I had to pick between the two I would go with the yellow because I think it&#x27;s richer and I love the scent, but I&#x27;m actually really happy to have the two &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;richer&amp;#34; options.</li>
    <li> AAAAaaaah it feels so good on my skin.  I use this to make homemade body butter and massage lotions.  It is so silky and moisturizing.  It is nice on its own, and phenomenal in my skincare recipes.  I really do LOVE it.  Got my friends and family hooked on it too.  I have rosacea...this stuff provides the moisture I need without added irritation or break outs.  Soothes my tired feet, heals my chapped lips, seals my split ends, I could go on all day!&lt;br /&gt;I love that is is one ingredient, organic, and NO chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
    <li> I received my order today and quickly slathered on some butter.  I love it.  I&#x27;ve come to love the slightly nutty smell of the butter and love the luxuriousness on my skin.  I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from Cleopatra&#x27;s choice before and this is the same exact high quality product as before.  The price is exceptional for the quality.  I ordered from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice because of their reputation and I have been very pleased with the quality, company, and customer service.  I was excited that it shipped and arrived so fast.  Will order again, and again, and again!</li>
    <li> The container was broken and was not sealed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great quality. Nice Ivory color, pleasant nutty smell, and easily melts to body temperature. It&#x27;s whips up great in my hair and body mixes.I&#x27;ve had the bad stuff (from the guys on 125th in Harlem) that has a play-doh/petroleum smell and who-knows-what kinds of additives. This is it.</li>
    <li> Not a bad choice for a moisturizer although it took longer than expected to absorb in to the skin.  I switched to using it as an overnight moisturizer and got better results.</li>
    <li> My son has bad eczema and dry skin. After searching for years I started looking into more natural and Eco-friendly products. it is all natural, Organic and one ingredient. I soon found out this worked when nothing else would! I also use informational organizations like the EWG.org to find the safest products for my family and this ranks high. After using this for my son I tried it and It is the best. I usually break out but this is great. Especially on really dry callused skin, feet, hands etc. Glad I found this product. it also comes in a tub so it is easy to remove and good till the last bit!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product! I use it for homemade body lotion and and a balm for my baby!</li>
    <li> I had never purchased shea butter before, but was eager to try making my own salves. Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice arrived when promised and was so silky smooth and was easy to incorporate essential oils into the Shea butter. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> This tub of Shea butter has blown all others away. It is extremely great quality and you can tell it is truly raw and organic. I made solid lotion foot bars and it performed flawlessly. It melted down and solidified just as it should and smells like true Shea butter. I rub this on my sons eczema at night before bed and his skin looks so much better by morning. The issues are truly endless with Shea butter and this brand is a great start to get the full benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> I am so amazed with this product. It is thick so a small portion goes a long way. The nutty fragrance is very light. Gives my hair strength. And unbelievable shine. I am sold on this product. Will order again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice!!!</li>
    <li> Great...authentic pure ivory shea butter</li>
    <li> Have used this brand of &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; in the past so I knew what to expect and wasn&#x27;t disappointed once again. The smell remains &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; so don&#x27;t expect a fragrance of any kind.. Just a great, natural moisturizer/skin conditioner!</li>
    <li> Product was of great quality and  arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Best moisturizer ever. I use it everywhere</li>
    <li> I have had diabetes for 45 years now, and used to get horrible cracks in my feet.  And this stuff works!  I actually have used it for several years now, starting with getting shea butter from a guy from Ghana who was selling it in a small mall.  Then I bought some in Chicago, and when that source dried up, I found this on Cleopatra&#x27;s.  I share it with everyone, verbally, and also physically, giving it away.  The latest is a friend who uses it on her dry eyelids.  Works much better than Vaseline!  This also is a real bargain, since many expensive products only contain a bit of shea butter, and this is totally shea.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and I must say I&#x27;m impressed with it.  I love the creamy texture, it isn&#x27;t grainy. It makes my skin feel very soft &amp; moisturized.  I am going to make a pomade with it to use in my hair.  I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This product helped somewhat with my dry skin. The texture of this product is hard and I had to use my blender to break it down and make it softer. I found better results using this as a daily moisturizer for my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered 1lb of Ivory,  delivery was brilliant and it&#x27;s giving me such relief (I can&#x27;t even use Argan oil because my skin flares most dreadfully).  Price-wise?  Well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is what I&#x27;ve experienced so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair:  deep conditioning that - for once - doesn&#x27;t take three days to wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin (face):  I.  Could.  Cry.  I have sensitive,  red and blotchy,  sallow,  combination skin which gets cranky all too often and it&#x27;s a nightmare to deal with at times.  Now?  Now  I can moisturize my face with just the right amount of oil.  My skin isn&#x27;t tight.  My flakes are going away.  It might not solve every skin problem I have (oh,  and there are many),  but this stuff is miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body butter:  exactly the same as the skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just never going to stop buying this.  And if you&#x27;re using oils to cleanse,  or moisturize,  or do whatever... treat yourself.</li>
    <li> Lovingly soft and silky. I made my own lotion and sun screen with this. and I think it is superb!</li>
    <li> its veeeery good items i love it but i heat the smell</li>
    <li> Great Shea Butter!  I will use it in skin care products!</li>
    <li> love this product.  Smells and looks yummy.  I used over the weekend in a bath and shower foaming scrub and it mixed in perfectly with the other ingredients.  Thankful to try this product again for the second time.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the great things I see with this product. I have to say that the product is hard as a rock, so dont be surprised. You need to scoop some out and rub in your hands and it will start to soften by your own body heat. I love how a little bit goes a long way, I took a dab and rubbed it into my hands and was able to moisten both legs and really center in on my problem area, my knees. The Shea Butter has a nutty scent to it I like to add an essential oil to it and change the smell and use depending on what area of my body or hair I want to use it on. It makes my skins feel so soft after applying it. My other problem area is my heels, I add a little lavender oil rub on my feet and put on socks...Soft feet in the morning! Remember to take little scoops and rub in hands to apply to your skin. This product is 100% natural and has no chemical ingredients in it, so I used it on my sons dry lips, so far they are looking better. Since a little bit goes a very long way, I know this product will last me a LONG time. It was well worth my money.</li>
    <li> I love the texture. I have been searching for the right moisturizer. Coconut oil is too greasy, Qtica is too expensive, others do not moisturize well This one is just the right amount of creamy and oily. My cuticles look great and my skin is soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer.  I use it at night while watching TV -- just rub between my palms until it melts then apply to elbows, feet, arms and legs.  Works wonders!</li>
    <li> This butter is great . It seems not to smell as Vikki as usual so that was a plus. . I mix this with coco butter and some oils . I learned by experience don&#x27;t melt it . Either butters . I put about 1/4 Ib of each . In blender with so some precious oils and DMAC ,VIT C and any other bulk vitamins I have on hand then (softened) butters and vitamin. In my ninja then walk away for about 10 minutes . It should be so creamy you want to eat it but you give it to your skin instead and it work miracles on skin and wrinkles . You will be satisfied as I am and I am hard to make happy ! .I will be buying this again and again .</li>
    <li> My dry skin is no more.This stuff is awesome, and I am never going back to lotion in a bottle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been around a month since I started using it, my skin is super smooth and it&#x27;s not too greasy.The only problem is it&#x27;s a bit hard so you have to take a bit in your palm and rub your both hand together and it will melt like butter.It&#x27;s bit greasy for my face but its great for body.I got this product for review purpose and this is my honest opinion and ya the quantity is more then enough, it will last for months.I got this for free as part of promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Love! Great moisturizer for my face after I use my African Soap! I just used it for my hair,I&#x27;ll give an update on how it faired through the night on my hair, but so far my hair is very soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different shea butters, as I like to use it as a stand-alone moisturizer on my face, and also as the main ingredient to my homemade chapstick and whipped body butters. I&#x27;ve tried shea butters that were more expensive, and some on the cheaper end of the spectrum, but this one is the only one I&#x27;ve been happy enough with to repurchase. Texture is smooth throughout, and there was no graininess to the product that I received. Soft, but not crumbly. True ivory, unrefined shea. Melts beautifully and incorporated well with the other oils and butters I use in my body butter and lip balm recipes. Whips up to a DIVINE consistency. Mild scent... kind of earthy, nutty smelling, but I didn&#x27;t find the scent strong enough to impart any of its aroma on the scent of my body butter or lip balm, and when I use it straight I don&#x27;t notice any lingering fragrance. For my body butter and lip balms, when I melt the shea, I SLOWLY heat it to 115 degrees in a double boiler and hold it at that temp for 15-20 minutes before mixing it with anything else or whipping. I find that when I do this, my end product always stays smooth and doesn&#x27;t get grainy over time. Incredibly moisturizing, soothing product. on skin AND lips!  I apply right after a shower or before bed (alone or in my whipped body butter) and my skin ALWAYS feels like butter.  My shins used to get so BEYOND ashy that they looked scaly- this shea butter has been a Godsend.  I had a weird and horribly persistent patch or perioral dermatitis around my mouth that sometimes looked like acne, sometimes like eczema, but nothing I used cleared it up, not even prescriptions.  I was walking around with these scaly, pimply, red patches around my mouth that looked like I had something contagious.  I started whipping Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice with a few drops of jojoba oil and using that mixture after cleansing with raw honey (twice a day, and an extra thick layer at night so that it could soak in while I slept), and within weeks my skinis back to normal- after suffering for more than 6 months with the dermatitis!    Holy Grail. Great balance of quality and value for the price. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I love how soft my skin is after using it. I use it everyday and my skin is softer than ever before.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the delivery and quality of this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this Shea Butter! A large container of good quality Organic Shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;A+++++++++++</li>
    <li> this is by far the best shea butter ive ever had.  i love that its organic! i love the packaging too a nice little tub.  i will be back for more when i use this up!</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter! It&#x27;s great knowing that there are no chemicals or pesticides or toxins in here! I use it as a diaper ointment on my baby and dry skin  for me or any other skin issues my 3 or 5 year old ever has! Great price! Will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> The product is great!</li>
    <li> Love it !!! Leaves my skin feeling so good . Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell with is great .</li>

    <li> Nice very hard but will make a good gift</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is so versatile!  Everyone in the house has been using it!  I love using it on my lips - they are instantly smooth and silky and feel great.  I have dry skin on my hands from cleaning and washing them so frequently - so I now use this on them at night before bed and they are soooo much better.  My son just had an eczema outbreak on his arm.  Used a little on his arm and it was gone within a day!  I love that it is organic.  I can&#x27;t wait to find out all the other ways this can be beneficial!</li>
    <li> This lotion was very thick. I am pregnant and am dealing with stretch marks and a little lotion covered my whole stomach! I am sure this thick lotion would be good for a lot of different things. The lotion does not smell sweet though. It has a mild smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff. You can use it for almost anything. Few stretch marks? This works miracles. Definitely five stars!!</li>
    <li> Excellent service and product.  Very happy customer..</li>
    <li> I applied this she&#x27;s butter on after I got out of the shower and I must say this left my skin very smooth and it wasn&#x27;t greasy so that&#x27;s a plus ☺️. The shea butter comes in a big tube, and it smells good and very easy to apply on. And on top of that I received my package fast. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product is well made, has an excellent consistency and a pleasant odor.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did not respond to the request for feedback right away because I wanted to use the product for a while first. My response is: Wonderful product!!!  I really love it!</li>
    <li> Shea butter arrived sooner than expected - very pleased.  Like this product very much - easy to use and a good bargain for the $$$.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the consistency of the Shea Butter.  It&#x27;s exactly what I expected. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> It is awesome, I&#x27;m using it all over my face to fade out acne scars, red spots, etc.. And it really moisturizes my skin without leaving it too oily. It&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture! Also you can use it all over your body, not just your face, which is awesome since this is a bulk amount of shea butter :)</li>
    <li> I was excited to get a one pound container of Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice 100% Pure Shea Butter .  This container will last me for a few months. I like how it comes in a protected container easy to open and close. This product is all-natural and inexpensive. I just rubbed a little on my hands and then on the dry parts of my skin. It was used  on my dry hands,elbows and feet . I used this product at night after taking my shower.  After only a week my skin was soft to the touch even my feet . I am pleased how shea butter softened the heals of my feet. Please note that a little goes a long way. I did not found the product to be greasy.The product has improved my dry skin and made a big difference overall . I did not mix the shea butter with any other oils or creams. For me, I just wanted to use it as a night skin treatment on my dry skin.  I was not financially compensated for this post.  I received Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Shea Butter for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It works awesome my skin is so much softer and have not had a break out. Thanks so much ;)</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality. I have used this in several different recipes now with essential oils and am very pleased.  It was nothing short of amazing in this recipe (I cut the coconut oil down to just a tiny little bit) because I really like this shea butter. http://www.thegoodoils.com/magiccream/</li>
    <li> Clean and fresh smelling and tasting.  Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice sent recipes for using their product.  I purchased this product at a reduced cost.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shea butter for 2 weeks, my chapped hands has been improved from severe winter this year.  I just use a bit of it every day, which tells me that I could use more than a year for the 1 lb shea butter.  That is a good deal.</li>
    <li> very nice product with fast delivery</li>
    <li> I used Cleopatra&#x27;s Organic Shea Butter to make a Cocoa Mocha Latte Body Butter! Whipped up beautifully with my other ingredients! End result was Heavenly! Creamy color with no harsh unpleasant odor! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality! Made a lovely body butter out of it!</li>
    <li> Uhm no...just no.. I got my little tub of this and immediately after opening it all I could think was, &amp;#34;What in the world?&amp;#34; It was dry to the touch and oooooooh so flaky. So I thought, &amp;#34;Well maybe I just have to mix it with something to soften it up?&amp;#34; Well...I mixed in some other oils of mine that I had at home aaand it still continued to have that bit of &amp;#34;flakiness&amp;#34; to it. I ignored that fact and tried using it in my hair regardless. NO. The product ending up leaving chunks of flakes in my hair and just made my hair feel extra greasy. I still love shea butter but I will never purchase this particular brand again.</li>
    <li> Nicely packaged in a clear tab. Melts down smooth and is of great quality.</li>
    <li> Works well as a moisturizer and is easier to apply when whipped.</li>
    <li> Product was packaged very Clean and neat.  I liked that the butter was in more of a blended  (yet UNREFINED) texture instead of clumps of butter. Smells very fresh, and easy to take out the container.  I would buy again.  Probably no time soon though because there is sooo much butter in the container.  Arrived before expected time also.</li>
    <li> My husband has very, very, very dry feet that crack and hurt him. I ordered this product, mixed it with coconut oil and applied it at night, covering with socks. His feet look awesome after 2 days. We&#x27;re very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to be able to test out this Cleopatra&#x27;s  Choice Shea butter is smooth and smells great.  It feels great on my skin and works great for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Pure with no additives or scent.  Perfect just what I wanted.  Great seller in every way.  Thank you for a job well done and if you are looking for the real deal this is it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before from another supplier, so I already knew about the benefits and uses for Shea Butter. I will be buying from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice because their product seems to be a better grade from what I had before.</li>
    <li> This shea butter arrives in a plastic container.  It is of high quality.  I use it for homemade lotion bars.  I also put some shea butter on a patch of eczema  that was acting up when I opened it and I saw a difference within a day.</li>
    <li> Nice tub of shea. Extremely happy. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> its very hard to get it to soften up</li>
    <li> I  have used this shea butter in my homemade sunscreen, deodorant, and applied directly to stretch marks that I have. It is very easy to work with, melts easily on the stove, as well as feels rich on the skin.</li>
    <li> This has been a wonderful product. We use it in place of regular lotion and it keeps our skin well moisturized. I look forward too seeing what lotions I can make with it.</li>
    <li> I love a good Shea! And Cleopatra&#x27;s the choice! It has that nutty smell that tells me it&#x27;s pure and has no added nothing!! I used it from my head down to my toes and enjoy every rub. Love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing product for a great price! I received this recently and love it. I will definately be making some body butters among other things</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter! So nice and smooth and it absorbs so nicely. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed making some lotions with this. It seems to be very good quality and my lotions turn out nicely.</li>
    <li> 1lb size was a little small</li>
    <li> Worked great in my homemade whipped body butter recipe ...loved that this purchase included a book w recipes that WORK!!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 different shea butters by mistake so I didn&#x27;t use it and sent it back.  it seemed different from the other shea butter.  The other one I received smelt better and had better texture. Maybe it&#x27;s the process of putting it into a container rather than leaving it in a block.  I do like the blocks better.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Very moisturizing and creamy. Worked great in my natural body butter!</li>
    <li> It came brickhard but within a hour it adjusted to room temperature which made it more managable to handle. It&#x27;s pure, very soft with a earthy smell and leaves your body moistened for 24hrs. Will I buy again??? Most definately!</li>
    <li> Great product, great for the skin and hair. excellent packaging and delivery.</li>
    <li> Very pure, made great whipped &amp;#34;sleepytime rub&amp;#34; from it and I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter. It is one of the best I have used. It came in a plastic container that had a nice seal. The shea butter is smooth and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;It is ivory in color.It has a nice smell.It absorbs in to my skin fast no greasy feel.I used it along with essential oils to make homemade lip balm that is so moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Very high quality shea butter! I&#x27;ve used mine for homemade lotion and homemade soap since I bought it and I&#x27;m very, very pleased! I will definately be purchasing more as soon as I run out!</li>
    <li> Ordered a tub to make some lotion bars, but this stuff is so amazing that I want to make a little of everything!! Whipped body butter, lotion, you name it! It is packaged in a handy deli-like container. It arrived frozen (it is January after all) but softened right up and scooped out easily. It has that earthy, Shea butter smell...nothing artificial. It worked amazingly for my lotion bars, makes my skin soft and supple but not greasy! It absorbs quickly. Fast shipping! Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> This raw shea butter is GREAT.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered it, so I googled around looking for some ways to use the raw shea butter.  I found a simple, no-heat whipped shea butter recipe that I thought I&#x27;d try out.  The stuff itself is crumbly-looking when you open the container, and I was worried about how to apply it.  The only scent is the scent of the shea butter itself - it&#x27;s just raw shea butter.  I scooped out 4 oz, added 2 tbsp of coconut oil, and some Aveda essential oils, and I got a rocking&#x27; whipped butter result - it&#x27;s VERY creamy, as you expect shea butter to be, and I love that I can scent it however I want.  I&#x27;ll definitely but poking around online to find other recipes that I can use this raw shea butter to make.  If you&#x27;re looking for great lotion - be prepared that this probably needs to be gently, quickly processed by you to be most useful.  Making my whipped lotion took all of five minutes, though, so don&#x27;t be scared!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product as I just received it. Looks perfect for my recipes but was not a full pound. Listing says 1lb (450 grams) yet when I weighed it it only weighs 15 oz including the container. That means I was shorted 2 ounces,  which is basically 2 batches of my products.  I will look elsewhere next time I order.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working.and last thru lots of washes.</li>
    <li> I was torn between this shea butter and that of another seller that offered it for a bit less.  Thankfully, I read the reviews thoroughly on both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore this product! As a bonus with your purchase, this merchant also emails you an eBook with formulas/recipes that use this shea butter. Last weekend, I made the body butter. With so many allergies, it&#x27;s rare that I find a formulation that doesn&#x27;t irritate me or break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a 20-yr-old in this skin again!</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Great consistency. Makes my skin feel super smooth. Great price. Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> The shea butter we ordered is high quality and was shipped quickly. I would definitely buy from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice again!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I make my own skin care products and this product is a must have!</li>
    <li> This Organic Shea Butter has worked wonders on my dry, cracked skin. This winter has been a rough one on my skin so when I was given the opportunity to try out this product, I was definitely excited! My hands have become noticeably more smoother and softer. The smell however is not the best compared to other shea butters that I have used but given the size of the amount that comes in the container, I couldn&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> This shea butter is fragrant and perfect to use for whatever you decide. It ships inside a plastic container that can be reused.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, I used it for making my chapstick, but rubbing it into my hands while I was making chapstick was soothing and healing for my hands as well!</li>
    <li> WHOA! I didn&#x27;t expect to receive such a large tub! This is great! You really get a lot of bang for your buck! It&#x27;s seriously going to last for a VERY long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already made homemade body butter in 3 different scents and still have a TON of the shea butter left. This will come in handy when making homemade spa products as gifts for friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent that shea butter has, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Mix in an essential oil of your choice and the sea butter will take on it&#x27;s scent. I&#x27;m partial to lavendar but you can use any one you want.</li>
    <li> Very nice and satiny. Can&#x27;t wait to start making some items with my essential oils. I had heard that shea butter can smell bad, but that is not the case here!! Very nice!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product three times and not once did I receive the ebook.</li>
    <li> This is just wonderful! It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my dry skin. I have really dry skin and it helped a lot! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Quality of the organic Shea butter is excellent, highly recommended! Thanks :-)</li>
    <li> The perfect Shea Butter for my lip balm, blended easily, good price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Nice shea butter, great moisturizer</li>
    <li> This is a high quality organic shea butter.  It is very creamy and moisturizing, better than any other I have used.  Have used it to make body butter as well as shaving cream.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ordered Shea Butter, however, when I showed it to some friends who have used other brands, they could not the quality! Not gritty and does not have a smell. I am going to make my own body butter and look forward to using this high grade/quality Shea Butter.</li>
    <li> The product is very good.  Unlike some people&#x27;s orders, my African Shea butter smelled like it should, it was fresh, and the right consistency. On my first order, I was shorted the proper amount.  I voiced my complaint and the problem was rectified. Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice made good by sending me more African Shea Butter than I was shorted.  Additionally, they said they would take care of the warehouse weighing issue. Because of their positive actions, I will be giving them another chance and buy from them again. Thanks for the integrity and standing behind your promise!&lt;br /&gt;  Doctoral Candidate Patricia Roulier aka The Soap Maker</li>
    <li> I have been using for a cuticle cream recipe but have found the salve works great on the rough and dry spots on my feet!</li>
    <li> I make homemade deodorant and it is going to be perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Solid chunk of shea butter. Almost completely odorless.  Works great in the lip balms I have made with it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I get dyshidrotic eczema on my hands and so they get very dry at times.  This stuff is nice and thick and it feels like my hands are actually getting moisturized.  I also use it on my 3 year old and baby for their super dry skin and it worked great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product everyday...everywhere (hair, body, feet, face, lips...). I can&#x27;t wait to try some of the recipes.</li>
    <li> I started using this as soon as I got it for my eczema and it seems to work great.  The only think i don&#x27;t like about it is that you have to scrap it out of the container.</li>
    <li> Good stuff so far. It came in solid, but is easy to work with if you warm it up a little. The way it softens skin is insane. I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews until I could rub it between two fingers for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little bit of a smell, but from what I&#x27;ve read, the real stuff should smell (not in an overpowering way). I&#x27;m still experimenting with mine, though I&#x27;m sure adding a fragrant oil will blend with it just fine.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. It seems creamier than other shea butter I have ordered and spreads easily.</li>
    <li> This is excellent Shea butter. It&#x27;s great quality, I use it with my essential oils and make organic body butters and lip balms etc.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to really use it because the butter is very stiff and I can&#x27;t easily apply to skin. I&#x27;m waiting for warmer weather, perhaps that will soften it more to where it will be pliable.</li>
    <li> Great product with excellent customer service and instructions on how to best use this.</li>
    <li> Perfect for DIY toiletries and items at home.</li>
    <li> So far I love this stuff, I use it in my lotion bars and it&#x27;s done wonders for my dry skin. Plus, once it&#x27;s mixed into the lotion bar I don&#x27;t find it leaving a greasy residue or an unpleasant smell, and the best part? NO allergic reaction! Having overly sensitive skin really limits what I can use but I&#x27;ll be buying this again!</li>
    <li> It has smell of spoiled oil and unrefined sunflower oil. It doesn&#x27;t get absorbed by skin quickly as real shea butter. Skin gets irritated instead of moisturized. I used shea butter from other retailers and this one feels like fake. I am surprised that it has so many positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Product is good quality, and it came quickly.  I&#x27;m enjoying using it!</li>
    <li> 2nd time ordering Shea butter, love making creams for relatives and friends. My daughter suffers from acne off and on. Her face broke out with small pumps all over face and covering with heavy make up did not help the matter. I told her she needed to try the Shea butter that would help she kept saying no because it was oily and that was not good for her face so she kept spending money on all those high price Sofora products that did not help much. She finally said she would try the Shea butter, I told her she needed to wash her face and after to clean well with witch hazel. I put Shea butter on her face and neck ( she had a couple of big pimples on her chin and one on her forehead) when she woke in the morning she was amazed at how the big pimples went down and how the small pumps on her face on some parts had gone away. Now she uses the Shea butter every night and the small pumps are going away, her face feels soft and now she has a even skin tone. She loves the Shea cream, she calls it the miracle cream.</li>
    <li> I love it!  For a couple of years, I&#x27;ve had friends bring back Shea Butter from their trips to Africa.  This product is the real deal and it allows me to have a constant supply of it!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like this Shea Butter.  I usually get mine from my local Whole Foods but this is much better.</li>
    <li> It rubbed into my skin very easily.  It never left any sort of residue, it was not greasy.  (I dislike greasy products so much so was super happy about this).&lt;br /&gt;I used to to rub into my legs and feet, and applied some to elbows and knees.  Again it rubbed in great.  I have very dry feet in the winter, so I found that it moisturized very well and am looking forward to using this daily to see if I can get rid of the dryness for good.  I also applied it as a lip balm, I found it great.&lt;br /&gt;I also have some stretch marks and scars that I am going to be applying this to.  I am curious to see if it will minimize the look of them.  I will definitely update at a later date to see if I find a difference&lt;br /&gt;only thing for me is I was not fussy of the natural smell of Shea Butter, so I will probably add some sort of scent with it when I use it again.  All in all a great product.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  Great product.  Received quickly.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter and the nice booklet that tells about the differing types of shea, how to properly melt it and the benefits of Shea.  Thank you so much for the great product, wonderful communication and the &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; extra that was really a big help.</li>
    <li> Great seller great product</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I slather this s*** on everything! Good stuff! I am using this to make my exclusive body butter, my own recipe but this company provides an e-book with some good tips and redipes on using this wonderful product. It is now a staple in my home. I have had excellent service with this company and was asked to provide honest feedback because I was given a super discount. I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this Shea Butter!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t fully understand how to use this product. I was thinking more of like a body butter. But I&#x27;m still looking up ways to use it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much. I just started using this and I use it for dry skin. I have used on my elbows and lips and face. I expected it to be really greasy and slick, but it absorbs very nicely into your skin. I will use their Ebook to look up other ways to use, but for now, this works for me, and its wonderful</li>
    <li> This was the first time I ever used Shea butter. When I got it I was surprised that it was so grainy and hard.I could not rub it into my skin. I did not really know how to use it so I melted it and it seemed to absorb into my skin ok. although the e-book was easily downloaded, I did not find the book very useful since I am a novice to Shea butter and only wanted to know how to use it. I could not find a phone number on the product or any place else on the emails that were sent to me so that I could call them with my questions.</li>
    <li> High quality shea butter. Works well for mixing into other products.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter!! I use it everyday!  Definitely will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I t is my first time using this product. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This shea butter was very economical and I was very pleased with the quality. I mixed it with coconut oil and sweet almond oil as well as essential oils for different uses.</li>
    <li> Great for making soap.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used shea butter, so I have nothing to compare it to.  However, Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Organic Shea Butter worked terrific in the recipe I used it in and have no reason to try any other brand.  Thank You for a nice product.</li>
    <li> Is Good I really like it.</li>
    <li> It smooth and creamy. Easy use and apply. It moisturizes your skin great.I use it daily and on even my baby.</li>
    <li> Like this one,I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I just used this shea butter to make body butter this week and I absolutely love it.  Its moisturizing and easy to use and now I have a decadent, creamy body butter which is a delight to use.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make body butters and the easy open container, resealable lid, and soft, easy to scope product made this a wonderful choice. As far as I can tell this shea butter is the real deal and makes any homemade lotion an ideal moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this for me, and I love it. Great quality! The texture is perfect and its purity has demonstrated itself after using it for several weeks...My skin feels great and looks amazing. So many blemishes and irritations have gone away.</li>
    <li> Great product  and a good price.  The Shea Butter was exactly as described and it didn&#x27;t have a strong smell like some pure shea butter I have used.  I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  This is a great brand that is exactly what they claim: pure, unrefined, raw, ivory, shea butter.  The price is fantastic as well.  I use the butter warmed in my hands on any areas that are sensitive, dry, irratated, and/or have open wounds as well as my face.  For my body, I whip it along with coconut oil to make a beautiful lotion.</li>
    <li> good to use in many recipes for body cream and such. My wife likes it</li>
    <li> This was packaged a little weird, but worked great.  Function is def more important than design in this case.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is amazing.  I made a cream combining it with coconut oil and essential oils.  It literally softened my feet overnight!  After I read the free book I learned that you are supposed to melt it first to keep it from being grainy. I didn&#x27;t melt it as recommended because the recipe didn&#x27;t call for it.  The cream is not at all grainy, but possibly that was because I used my mixer to beat everything together. I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  I will definitely be ordering this shea butter again.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Smooth great smell.</li>
    <li> Great for softening and soothing skin!</li>
    <li> Fairly better quality than other brands I have bought. It&#x27;s a little more solid but the texture is consistant which is great. No chunks. It came in a tub rather than a bag. I&#x27;ve been using it in homemade lotion bars, sunscreen, lipstick, and just by itself.</li>
    <li> Smooth, creamy, great aroma and texture.  I used it in my body butter recipe and it turned out perfectly.</li>
    <li> The Shea Butter itself is great!  It&#x27;s a wonderful, long lasting moisturizer, and has a nice nutty (almost chocolatey) scent. I put it on my hands this morning, and my hands have not dried out, even through a few hand washes.  It is a little difficult to remove from the container, but I discovered that a slightly warm spoon works very well for scooping it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the reason for only 3 stars: the e-book. Those of you who did not receive it, don&#x27;t worry, you&#x27;re not missing much. As I started reading it, I noticed a few typo&#x27;s (using the wrong &amp;#34;to&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;where&amp;#34; vs. &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34;, etc).  Not a big deal, lots of ebooks have typo&#x27;s. I also noticed some of the pages are out of order...not cool. The major issue, however, is content.  It does have some good information about shea butter itself, but I cannot trust any of the recipes in it.  Maybe I&#x27;m a little under-qualified to be writing this, because I have never actually made soap, but I have done lots of research on the soapmaking process, and plan to make soap in the near future.  The most obvious problem with the soap recipes in this book is the fact that several of them do not include lye as an ingredient.  If you do not use lye, you will not get soap, period.  The non-lye recipes might give you a nice lotion bar, but they will certainly not be soap.  The next issue with the soap recipes (that do include lye...I can&#x27;t speak for lotion bars) is that the instructions say to put the soap in the refrigerator to cool after pouring it into the mold.  While milk soaps generally are cooled, because the sugar in the milk combined with lye produces a lot of heat, I have never come across a soapmaking resource that suggests cooling a non milk soap. In fact, most soapmakers actually insulate their soap to keep it warm through the saponification process.  I don&#x27;t know what refrigeration would do to the soap, but it certainly won&#x27;t help anything.  My last problem with the soap recipes is that they also say to wrap the bars in wax paper and store in an airtight container.  This is probably a good way to store lotion bars, but soap needs ventilation.  Air circulation helps soap to cure and dry out.  Wrapping it in wax paper seems unwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for the other recipes, but unfortunately, since the soap recipes are so far from reliable, I would not trust any of the other recipes in this book.  If you want to make stuff out of shea butter, I suggest doing some research before attempting any of the recipes in this book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final thing I wanted to point out is the book does discuss the difference between ivory and yellow shea butter.  They are basically the same, and I am perfectly content with my ivory shea buttter, but what if I wanted yellow?  The sticker on the lid of my shea butter has boxes labeled &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;, with ivory being marked.  It&#x27;s a minor issue, but there is no way to specify during ordering which version you want. It seems to be just the luck of the draw which color you get.  I noticed while browsing other shea butters on Amazon, that a lot of them do have an option for choosing ivory or yellow.  Having a choice would be nice..e bars in wax paper and store in an airtight container.  This is probably a good way to store lotion bars, but soap needs ventilation.

    <li> I am amazed at how huge the product is. I am extremely pleased. It is not lumpy like I usually get from African Shea Butter. It is creamy and goes on smooth. I use it to moisturize my face after deep cleaning, and it works wonders when I put it on my scalp.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter feels amazing!  I have made up a salve with almond oil and coconut oil to be used to avoid/remove &amp;#34;Tiger Stripes&amp;#34; (stretch marks). It actually does seems to fade them. Even if it didn&#x27;t that salve makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
    <li> This is the absolutely best ever shea butter!  You will not be disappointed!  Keep your skin (and hair) in check!  The Price is great too!  Mix your favorite essential oil with it!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products ever!! I love the pure shea butter.  Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice is a great site to get information on the product and their shipping is always fast.</li>
    <li> I use my blow drier to get it soft and then apply it all over my belly and all the other areas that are prone to stretch marks. The product leaves my skin moisturized and soft the entire day. so far so good, let&#x27;s see if it&#x27;ll help me prevent some stretch marks. I&#x27;m confident that it will....</li>
    <li> Used this in a recipe for eczema relief cream.  It worked wonderfully and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very nice Shea Butter, though I don&#x27;t have any previous experience. but it looks and works perfect</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this organic shea butter and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I have a large patch on my arm where I burned it many years ago. That place was always dry even though I would put moisturizer on it. I started putting this shea butter on the patch and it really made it feel better. Not dry anymore and not flaky at all. This shea butter is like no other moisturizer I have ever used. It is very hard so I kind of dug a bit of it out of the plastic container and placed it on my skin.  Then I put my finger on top of it and it became very soft and palpable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shea butter is a very deep moisturizer but can be used every day. I also use it on the heels of my feet before I go to bed and it really works well on them. I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I highly recommend this shea butter for whomever would like a natural deep moisturizer for their skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> Good price and great product. Made some coconut/shea butter lotion already!</li>
    <li> Great product. I am happy with the consistency and look forward to applying it to my daily skin care regimine!</li>
    <li> First time using organic shea butter, but did not like the smell.  I think I would prefer one with a scent added.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Shea Butter, I mean c&#x27;mon what woman doesn&#x27;t love Shea Butter. I was fortunate to receive a 1 lb tub of Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice 100% Pure, Unrefined, Organic Shea Butter for product testing and reviewing. This stuff is amazing! It actually dates back to Ancient Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;According to Wikipedia; the history of Shea as a precious commodity can be traced back to Ancient Egypt, where Shea butter was and continues to be used to protect the hair and skin against the fierce sun and the hot dry winds of African deserts and savannah.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how centuries later women all over the world are still using Shea butter. Obviously it is with good cause. I love it because it absorbs into my dry skin and provides lasting hydration and isn&#x27;t greasy. I also love to use it as a lip balm. It also helps soothe my mild eczema flair ups and is rich is vitamins A &amp; E. I used to use it after I gave birth to my now 18 year old daughter to help eliminate stretch marks. And it&#x27;s also great mixed with my favorite moisturizer to amp it up a bit in my ongoing battle of preventing wrinkles. I know this tub of Shea butter will last a long time and I&#x27;m very happy with product. I would absolutely buy it again and definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have recent discovered to greatness of shea butter so I was excited to be given the opportunity to purchase this at a special price to test this product for quality. It was much harder than I expected, not creamy like the kind of shea butter you find in bottles. It has a light scent. The butter starts to melt from the heat of your hand once you scoop it out. I have used it in two ways so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have been using it as a skin moisturizer for the inevitable dry skin that strikes in Indiana in the winter. Specifically on my feet. I lather it on before bed and put on socks. After on one night, I could already tell my feet had softened considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I have been using it as a moisturizer for my hair.  I melt some in my hand and rub it through my dry locks after blow drying.  It tames down the frizzies and makes the split ends look less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not sure what to do with you product, don&#x27;t worry.  You will also receive a link after purchase with 50 recipes to use your Cleopatra&#x27;s shea butter.  There is no added color or fragrance and it is paraben free.  Best of all, the company offers a 1 YEAR money back guarantee.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
    <li> This is one of the highest quality Shea Butter&#x27;s that I have used.  I make organic body butter to sell at trade shows.  It is very important to me and my customers that I can find only the best ingredients to make my products.  Shea butter has a long lasting effect on your skin even after you have washed it off your hands.  Using organic and pure ingredients and adding rose hips for vitamin C is a treat for your skin.</li>
    <li> total weight with container was 14.3 ounces.</li>
    <li> It the first body butter that I found that works on my children&#x27;s eczema. I&#x27;m so happy that its going to last a long time too. Would recommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I bought it for my husband and for my daughter. My husband is currently using it to lighten some dark spots on his neck. We are having positive results so far. My daughter uses it in her hair. She has very thick curly hair that is very dry naturally so this shea butter is perfect to give her some moisture.</li>
    <li> Other than the annoying emails asking for a rating (starting before I even got the product), this is a very nice product.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt the best shea butter i have ever purchased. Extremely buttery and delicious.  And it smells amazing.  The texture is smooth and moisturizing without being greasy. Ive used it on my hands and lips so far and it has made my hands feel amazing.  I downloaded the recipe book and i can&#x27;t wait to try some recipes for my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
    <li> I made my first batch of whipped body butter today using this Shea butter and a few other ingrediants. I&#x27;m amazed at how much is in this container. It feels spectacular and not really greasy. Thank you for the great item</li>
    <li> I have never used shea butter by itself before only products containing shea butter. I will compare this to using coconut oil on my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a pleasure to use the Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice shea butter! I gave my mother and my son&#x27;s girlfriend some. My husband used it and so did my son. You are getting opinions from five different people and we all liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes beautifully. My husband&#x27;s feet are actually soft for the first time in years without having to apply lotion 5 times a day. We used the shea butter at night and his feet did not need a reapplication at all during the day. We will continue to use it and I think eventually we will need it only once a week for maintenance. Right now we are using it every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son used it on his dry, cracked elbows and on his lips. He has a tendency to get badly chapped lips in the winter. It worked beautifully! He applied it twice a day and probably only needed it once. He really liked it on his elbows. The white, flaky skin has disappeared and his elbows are very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother used this as a deep conditioner for her hair. A little goes a long, long way. She really liked it but said if you have fine hair you may want to mix just a little bit in some water and apply it as a deep conditioner once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son&#x27;s girlfriend and I used it as an all over body moisturizer and we loved it. Immediately after showering take just a little at a time and rub it all over your body. This is safe to use on your face, lips, etc. It worked wonders on our dry skin. It&#x27;s been a very rough winter and we&#x27;ve used a variety of natural oils to keep our skin soft. The shea butter measures up there as very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was provided to me by the seller either free or nearly free. In return I agreed to provide my 100% honest opinion/review.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I used it, along with cocoa butter, coconut oil and almond oil, to make a lotion. I do not know which ingredient(s) caused this issue, but as great as the lotion is, it doesn&#x27;t really absorb into the skin. You have to rub it on, then put on long layers for about 30 minutes, during which time the oils soak into the skin, making it feel great. I do prefer lotion to not be greasy upon application. I don&#x27;t know if this was the shea butter&#x27;s fault or a combination of factors, though. It was very easy to use, nice and soft, but not too soft. It smells wonderful. Overall, a good product that I am eager to try again in other recipes</li>
    <li> So far so good with this product. I use it in many wellness creams and lotions. However, I haven&#x27;t had the product for two weeks as stated in your email to me. Only one.</li>
    <li> I got this cream because the reviews and they are lying about that product, this product did not let my skin soft, was ggod only for the hands, other then that, gave a allergic reaction, was teriible, do not believe on the false reviews. I was very, very, very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something to use to make body scrub, and shaving cream, this Shea butter was perfect. It whipped together with my cocoa butter and coconut oil to make a really nice body butter. It has more staying power than the other two. I do not particularly care for the smell, but mixed with my cocoa butter the chocolate scent is strong enough to cover the light fragrance of the Shea butter. The e book that was sent to me when I made the purchase had some helpful tips and nice ideas inside. It helped me to get a good idea of how much of each product to mix when making my own new recipes too.</li>
    <li> I sent this back the same day I received it.  This Shea butter smelled like burnt rubber and it literally made me gag.  I ordered a different brand of raw, unrefined, 100% African Shea butter, that I have used in the past, and it definitely has the smoky/nutty smell that I&#x27;m used to, it did not smell rancid like Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice.  I&#x27;m thinking with all of the good reviews, I must have just gotten a bad batch, but still I would have to think twice before ordering it from them again.</li>
    <li> Great product I comcine this with the coconut oil and coconut butter. Leaves your skin really soft.</li>
    <li> This product goes on smooth and really hydrates the skin. My skin is usually dry and cracked. I applied the shea butter and it has worked wonders. I received this at a huge discount exchange for an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Wonderful texture, leaves my skin silky soft! Looking forward to continued results!</li>
    <li> It is very wonderful goods.&lt;br /&gt;My son has been suffered from Atopic Dermatitis for several years, so his skin is not so good.&lt;br /&gt;This butter does good effect on his skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I use it in my lip balm, lotion, all my homemade essentials!</li>
    <li> This is real shea butter. Bought it for my grand baby and also used some on myself. I need more and will let my daughter order it today.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected. Gave it to my mom and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Have used a bit for dry skin. Will be using to make home made lotions and chapstick.</li>
    <li> I have terribly dry hands so this Shea Butter is nice to have to help keep them more moist and hopefully youthful as well. Lot&#x27;s of uses for Shea Butter. My son has my dry skin so we use this on him as well.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve gotten Shea butter from other sources and this one is exceptionally smooth and silky and has a lovely smell, rather like coco butter.</li>
    <li> This item, is so creamy and not to heavy on my hair. it makes my hair soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t leave a flaky residue. I also use this item on my body to help with the dry patches. i love the way it mixes well with different oils</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with it. It whips up into a smooth butter. I will purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using the product.  It has good color and scent.  The e-book was also very useful.  I would use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on my skin!</li>
    <li> Love that I&#x27;m able to heat this up and mix it to make alot of different beauty products! It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and revitalized!</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it. I love the huge size, how it&#x27;s organic,  and most importantly how it&#x27;s fair trade!!! I use this as my daughter&#x27;s after bath lotion, as chapstick, and will be using it as leave in hair oil. It takes a bit to warm up and scrape off but totally worth it. Just take the time to warm in your hands then apply!</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. Best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Great! Item is exactly as described and the shipping was super fast. I have only used it a couple of times because I plan on making Body Butter out of it. I plan to update the review once I do that so I can let you know how it turns out. :)</li>
    <li> Very luxurious, smooth texture, the softest I&#x27;ve ever purchased. No need to mix with other oils to use (I use for my hair) Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now, mostly on problem areas like my lips, knees, and elbows which are exceptionally dry. It has definitely been effective at both softening these areas as well as lightening them. I love that it is organic and it does not have a strong smell. I have yet to mix it with peppermint oil as others  have suggested, but will try this next. Overall, satisfied and would definitely recommend, especially for such a great price and considering that it is organic and high quality.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! If I had to use only one moisturizing product, from head to toe, this would be the one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not by the least disappointed in the quality of the organic Shea butter. It makes my skin feel radiant and soft. I made a few recipes using the e-recipe download that was provided with the Shea butter. I absolutely love repairing foot balm recipe. It made my feet looked less dry and less noticeable cracked in just 1 time using it. I recommend trying. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Good smell, not too hard, and it makes my skin so soft. A winner so far!</li>
    <li> Good quality and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It was hard as a rock but I left it out in the sun and it softened up. Now when I scoop it out with my fingers, it melts right away in my hands. As someone who suffers with eczema, this stuff has been great. I&#x27;m now using it in my scalp to help with dry patches as well. It&#x27;s great on my face too. It may seem oily but it seeps into your skin pretty quickly. It&#x27;s also helped with my sunburn.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is wonderful!  I always like to choose the healthiest option in things when I can so when I saw this shea butter, knowing it was 100% shea butter with nothing else added, I could not wait to try it.  I have bought some in the past that I thought were 100% pure but was sadly disappointed....so I have learned to read the label.  This one is easy.  It is a really nice texture that spreads easily when you start putting it on.  It moisturizes my skin really nicely.  My skin is now feeling so much softer and more hydrated.  I am sold!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> love love love this... this is amazing stuff. makes my body feel so soft.</li>
    <li> It is moisturizing but that is about the only positive thing I have to say. It has such a strong unpleasant smell. I have not been successful in covering it up with any amount of oils/smells. Not sure if this is normal but I have used shae butter products before and never dealt with this smell. I will most likely be purchasing a different brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shea butter for several years and have never had it smell at all before. It&#x27;s hard to describe the smell, but it sort of smells like dirt, not rancid, but NOT something I&#x27;d like other people to smell on me. I thought once I rub it into my skin the smell would dissipate-it did NOT. The texture is perfect though.</li>
    <li> Awesome  I love it. The seller was prompt and I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> This is a good product I can use in all of my lotions and potions!</li>
    <li> Great size for the amount of raw shea butter in the container.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing. I love the feeling of my skin after I use it. I wish I had this product over the winter.the product smells really nice and is creamy. Highly recommend this product. Works great on eczema saw results in just a few days.</li>
    <li> this product was lovely left my skin very soft and you don&#x27;t need a lot of product it goes a long way! I ordered a second one for my sister and she is happy with it as well good price for the amount of product</li>
    <li> Big tub!  Great stuff, great price!</li>
    <li> I whip this with olive oil in a mixer for a nice whipped Shea butter lotion - great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Shea Butter for several years and I love it. I blend it with a little extra virgin olive oil and it is the only body and face moisturizer I use.  I have sensitive skin and have not had any breakouts from using this. I put it on in the morning and it lasts all day; no dry, flaky, itchy skin later on like with store-bought lotions.  The Shea Butter is a little hard, which is why I use a hand mixer to beat it with some oil, but it melts nicely in your hands and can be easily smoothed over skin. Their customer service has always been fantastic as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I use it in my lip balm, lotion, all my homemade essentials!&lt;br /&gt;It works awesome. My skin is so much softer .</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I have used it everyday since I received it and will buy more when I run low</li>
    <li> Great relief for eczema!</li>
    <li> I love love love this organic Shea butter! I was so excited when I was given the opportunity to review this product! I just had a baby two months ago, and I have been looking for a product to help with the stretch marks. Shea butter is perfect for those pesky stretch marks. This Shea butter comes unrefined in a clear container. It is also a great facial moisturizer, hair moisturizer, and much more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hands, elbows, and feet and love it.  It has a mild, natural scent, almost like coffee (?) and is not oily or slippery, but does a great job of moisturizing my skin.  My new favorite.</li>
    <li> This organic shea butter is amazing. It is high quality and works so well. I could not believe how well it worked. I put it on before bed and woke up and it had already worked. My daughter has eczema and put it on and over night it was half way healed. Three days and you can&#x27;t even tell she had such bad spots. You can&#x27;t tell she even has eczema. I also love the fact that its such a value because it comes in such a large size. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I received my Shea butter in a nice re-sealable container. I use on my legs because I have stretch marks. It works great for lightening stretch marks. It smells really good too.</li>
    <li> I did my research ( googled the hell out of it) and this is one of the more trusted brands out there. It may take minor effort to rub it in evenly if it is colder but it melts fairly easily, and it makes my skin feel nourished, but not oily. I find the smell to be gentle and pleasant, and I can even mix in my own essential oils to enhance it. I.plan on buying again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my elbows and feet mainly due to them being so dry from the winter weather.  I love it!  It really has helped smooth my skin.</li>
    <li> When I first put some on, I was immediately startled by its barbecue-like smoky smell, which fortunately, does fade fairly quickly.  After some research, I now see that the smell is natural in unrefined Shea, AND will go away with whipping in a bit of essential oil.  I think I&#x27;ll try that because I love the way my skin feels after using this product.</li>
    <li> This is the highest quality Shea Butter yet.  It is of the purest form.  I use it for my hair, stretch marks and also for my face.  It is multi-functional.  Awesome product and totally naturally.  It can be used on your hands and as a lip balm.  One container goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Nice product. 100% raw shea butter. I like the naturalness of this product. Makes skin very soft and silky/</li>
    <li> I love how this absorbs into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy. It&#x27;s a great product with so many uses!! I love the e-book that was sent with it that shows you all the different ways it can be used.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give this product and service more than 5 stars, I am starting to make some of my own &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; beauty products and this was more than I expected.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I stay at home with my baby most of the time, and the heating is just drying out my skin so badly. I started using humidifier and keep my skin moisturized. I mix this shea butter with other kinds of oils and use it for my skin, nails and hair. I love this butter cuz it is natural and very affordable way to pamper my skin, hair, etc.</li>
    <li> So smooth U can just scope out of the Container blended  so Nicely..</li>
    <li> This product came in well sealed packaging and has lasted a long time, I have only made my way through maybe a quarter of it in the last four months.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Works wonders repairing my hair and healing very dry skin!</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I have not used any other moisturizing or healing creams since I received this. It works miracles on diaper rash especially! When my baby gets some terrible rashes from eating acidic fruit,  I put this on at night,  and the next morning her skin is perfect again. I have also used this on my dry,  cracked hands,  and it made them silky smooth again after a few applications. I use it on dry spots on my body, and it clears them right up. My husband even uses it on his head and face after shaving to promote healing sometimes, and loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife to use in her homemade lotions &amp; salves. it arrived as expected. She loved it. She said this is definitely the best shea butter she has gotten lately!! The price was spot on as well. We will be ordering again. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have been putting this on my hair about 15 min. Before shampooing. Makes my hair softer and shinier. Also use on my face. Nice.</li>
    <li> I had received this discounted and it was my first time trying shea butter. I instantly fell in love with it. It worked wonders on my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone who has tried everything for dry skin, because this has been one of the only things I have found that really works on mine!</li>
    <li> This is great!  I whipped some up and added it to my homemade deodorant and my arm pits have never felt more luxurious!  It really works well.  I love it to just slather on my face as is (after some softening of the butter, of course).  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product! shipped on time. Bought it twice already. I wish the price was a bit lower, since I&#x27;m using a lot of this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. My son has a sensory processing disorder. This is the only product he has used that he stated has helped his hands and feet.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is fantastic. I use it along with almond oil for a face cream and it isn&#x27;t greasy just  makes my skin glow. I can tell a difference immediately. It is also can be used straight on the face or body. I use it as well for m y lotion bars. Absolutely love this Shea Butter. You can&#x27;t go wrong and this merchant follows up on your order as well as giving you free recipes to use. You should try it !</li>
    <li> Product is creamy and smells great.  I am looking forward to using it in some creams I intend to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Nice, pure, odorless.</li>
    <li> I use everyday on my face and hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased shea butter before, so I don&#x27;t have any other shea butters to compare it to. But this seems to do just fine. It&#x27;s like an ivory color. I used it to make a body cream with my essential oils. I used:&lt;br /&gt;1/4 c shea butter&lt;br /&gt;1/4 c sweet almond oil&lt;br /&gt;1/4 c olive oil&lt;br /&gt;1/4 c (or 2oz) of organic beeswax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put all in a glass jar, place in a pot of almost boiling water (for a double boiler type of setup), and stir occasionally until all melted.&lt;br /&gt;Take the jar out of the water, set on counter to cool. After a few minutes of cooling, add essential oils of your choice. I made an eczema cream, so I used 5 drops of lavender and 10 drops of tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is when I transferred the mixture into a smaller glass container. Or you can just leave it in the original if that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it cools, stir occasionally. And ta-da...that&#x27;s it. The picture is of my final body cream product... Not of the shea butter itself.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter has replaced moisturizers in our household. It is very effective.</li>
    <li> First time buying shea butter! Quick shipping loved the product so far. Melted down nicely and firmed up without any strange color changes goes on smooth . . Can&#x27;t complain at all!  Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have seen improvements with my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is how stiff it is.  It is a little hard to rub on.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff!!! Skin never felt better!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  This Shea butter is wonderful.  I have used it in my lotion and body butter recipes.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> Good quality shea butter, I used it in a sunscreen recipe and it helped the scent and texture.</li>
    <li> smells good, feels great!!!</li>
    <li> I really like it. The shea butter leaves a waxy feel to skin. I also like the smell which is a light, musty smell. It is harder than coconut oil but if you rub it in your palms you can spread it. It also came with a free e-book. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter.  I enjoy making body butters  and natual skin care products and this product is great and I love how smooth this is.</li>
    <li> I gave it as a gift and it worked for their dry patchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> worked well for body butter. some of it was a little grainy, as if it had been exposed to temperature extremes.</li>
    <li> Seriously this is the best thing that has ever entered my life!! I have chronically dry skin, so i bought it originally for my stretch marks on my hips and thighs. I saw that it also can be used on your face... This literally took the place of every moisturizer bb or face oil I own!! I cant believe I have been spending so much money all these years when I just could have used this. My scars are fading!! my thirsty skin is now nourished. I even put a very small amount under my make up for a dewy affect that makes my foundation stay all day!! Stay natural buy natural. Its the only stuff I will ever use now.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Needs better packaging though. Was delivered on a hit summer day and the butter had melted and spilled over the box.&lt;br /&gt;Product still gets 5 stars. Good quality. I used it on my 5 yr old and his eczema is now non existent in just 3 days of use.</li>
    <li> My first impression was that this shea butter is very solid and hard to use. However, when it melts, it absorb into skin very fast and makes skin feel so smooth. However, I don&#x27;t like the nutty smell. It is too nutty for me, but once I mix it with other oils and use it every night before bed, I get used to the nutty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shea butter product! My leg skin is so dry that I still see dry flakes every morning when I wake up (even though I applied coconut oil from Trader Joe&#x27;s the night before). After I use Shea butter whipped with coconut oil, jojoba oil, argan oil, and vitamin E concentrated, my skin feels much better I don&#x27;t see any dry flake! The free ebook that was sent with the product is very helpful, but if you can&#x27;t find it, you can go online (such as youtube) to find recipes how to use shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bonus is that the shea butter actually fades my scars away (maybe because I mixed it with lots of oils that are high in vitamin E)</li>
    <li> Came in a plastic container w/ lid inside a bag.  The butter is soft enough to use straight as it is and I see nothing wrong with it.  Smells nice.  I got it to mix with other stuff to make my own butter, but it could easily be used as is.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I mix it with coconut oil to make a lot of skin products and it really hold up well! It shipped quick and arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shea butter for a long time and I love it leaves my skin soft smooth and feeling kind of a rejuvenated. I got this Shea butter while he was on promotion and I am super happy about it. I definitely recommend this she better to everyone especially people that have rough for skin I personally put it on my elbows as well as my face. This Shea butter is actually pretty thick and feels like a mask and after I wash it off my face feels a bit oily but with my experience with Shea butter that&#x27;s normal.</li>
    <li> omg love this use it for everything</li>
    <li> Very smooth, melts into skin instantly. I&#x27;ve purchased 3 times now . I say yay</li>
    <li> I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;The butter is high quality and works wonders for moisturizing skin. I use it on nearly every inch of my body and it is an amazing moisturizer. One pound of quality shea butter for under fifteen dollars is an absolute steal. My package arrived a few days early, but unfortunately there is a crack in the side of the tub and for that reason I have docked a star. I have over bagged the tub to prevent excessive drying of the butter. Despite that flaw, I would highly recommend this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> The tub it came in was broken</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is an excellent product, smooth, fine , and not greasy ! Best Shea butter ever I had !</li>
    <li> Very nice &amp; clean.Looking forward to try it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Using in all kinds of lotions and potions. Have very dry cracked heels and now my feet are summer ready. Would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> Great product. You could either use it as is or whip it to make it easier to use. I use it as is. I put some in my hand and spread it like I would lotion and it softens up and I use it on my hair and skin. When I use it on my hair my hair is wet and when I&#x27;m done it keep my hair mositurizes for a long time. The same for my skin. I really like this product. I got this free for review.</li>
    <li> Wonderful,Thanks CLEOPRATA!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have made several lotions  and bars for my friends and family. Lovely texture and absorbs nicely without a greasy feeling leaving skin soft for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Good Product, did exactly what I was expecting!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Love it!</li>
    <li> It seemed more drier than the shea butter I normally buy, not creamy and moist.&lt;br /&gt;But the price is great.</li>
    <li> Very Good, I&#x27;m learning a lot of stuff from the book!</li>
    <li> Great product, some of the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Great product. Not greasy at all and no smell whatsoever. Only things I didn&#x27;t like about it is the container it came in, cheap plastic and the color of the butter is not the rich yellow kind but sort of like a faint yellow green that almost resembles a faint guacamole color. But other than that, it&#x27;s a good product. Great for dry skin specially for calloused feet and dry elbows and knees.</li>
    <li> I had never worked with shea butter before, so I have nothing to compare this product with. However, I liked the natural color and clean smell. It melted nicely and the solid lotion I made with it came out very well.</li>
    <li> I prefer another brand who is about the same price.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used it to make a whipped body butter which allows for better application. Love the price for great product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for tattoo aftercare and have been using it exclusively since I had my tattoo retouched.  The shea butter is smooth and melts quickly into my skin, and my tattoo looks fantastic!  It healed up much faster than last time, when I was using ointment and lotion for aftercare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used some to make a blended shea and cocoa butter cream.  It melted and blended well, and the finished product smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I have been using Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice raw shea butter for a couple of weeks now, and I am very satisfied. It the best organic and natural product I have tried to help fade sun spots, acne scars and wrinkles. I highly recommend it, especially to those looking for non-toxic natural skin solutions!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this Shea butter and how smooth my skin is!</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I paid $10,93. The price has changed. It&#x27;s a very good butter. Highly recommended. I use it as a hair mask and I&#x27;m not disappointed!</li>
    <li> Huge tub will last a long time! Has helped with relieving some itching from my eczema and makes my skin super soft!</li>
    <li> first time purchasing raw and unrefines shea butter..Seems to do the job but the odor has a slight petroleum like smell and is easily covered up by adding essential oils. May try another brand to see if it is lacking in this odor</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I ordered mine from another website but it&#x27;s the SAME product.  I love the light nutty scent and how it  truly moisturizes my skin. A little goes a LONG way with this product. If you want a smoother texture try melting  a little on top of the stove (microwaving it will damage vital nutrients within the Shea Butter).&lt;br /&gt;The product pairs well with African Black soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*All natural no chemicals and great for your skin*</li>
    <li> I received my order in a timely manner but was unable to write a review. I am so in love with this amazingly luxurious shea butter. I have atopic dermatitis due to the quality of water. My skin is dry all the time no matter what product I use. Upon using this butter, my skin magically transformed into soft and less irritated. very pleased with the quality of the product and customer service of this company. Highly recommend to anyone experiencing atopic dermatitis, has dry skin or just likes to use high quality products.</li>
    <li> Aside from the tub containing the Shea butter being split up the side exposing the contents, and the 50 page guide missing, I am satisfied with the product itself. Service is another matter.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchases of Shea butter. I have no prior experience with which to compare. That being said, I&#x27;ve been creating aromatherapy oils for 10 years. The double boiler, and work involved in  creating creams and lotions seemed so difficult. So, I always skipped those recipes. Now, many years later, my skin is aging, I&#x27;ve become more sensitive to unnecessary additives, and I finally got the courage to try some of those interesting recipes that I&#x27;ve skipped in the past. I started with this Shea butter, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This butter smells fresh, melts great, and the texture is silky when cooled. I mixed with coconut butter, a tiny bit of bees wax, e oil, apricot kernel oil, and some essential oils, chamomile in my first batch, to calm my sensitive skin - most purchased here on Amazon. I loved it, shared it with my husband, and he asked me to make some for him! My second batch turned out great, also. I recommend this Shea butter to everyone who wants a quality butter that combines well to create many great face, body, hair and nail care products. Your imagination is the limit. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to try this!</li>
    <li> Great product. Smooth consistency, absorbs easily. You get a lot for the price too.</li>
    <li> Good product I have purchased it twice and have been happy both times.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love it, but I hated the texture it had a grainy texture and little to no scent. However worked good for blending with my cocoa butter and oils to use as a body butter. But I will be looking else were to purchase shea butter from.</li>
    <li> received item in a damaged state (cracked across the bottow and taped with a label).  Item was supposed to be yellow in color, however, it was a combination of white and yellow.</li>
    <li> Love the Shea butter but thought I was responding to an offer for 5.95 and ended up costing almost $16.00.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with this Shea Butter. I used it to make whipped Shea Butter. I love the texture. I made another whipped Shea Butter using another brand and it didn&#x27;t give me nearly the results that this Shea Butter did. I just placed an order for some more.</li>
    <li> Received exactly what i expected.&lt;br /&gt;Made lotion bars a few days after receiving and it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter has a distinct smell and this certainly smells like shea butter!&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I wish the recipe pamphlet had been included, but I have used the shea butter to moisturize both hair and skin, and it is excellent.  My family has eczema and my oldest child&#x27;s symptoms cleared within three days application.  It absorbs quickly and the scent is mildly reminiscent of almond butter.</li>
    <li> Best shea butter ever! I use it all the time, my mom is now also hooked! It works wonders on my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I am attending an essential oils class and shared my shea butter with the other participants.  It carries fragrant oils well and it is extremely moisturizing.  Without it, my skin is like crepe. After using it, it&#x27;s almost like babies wonderful&#x27; skin.  Happy skin is a healthy, protective barrier for us in our toxic environments.</li>
    <li> A bit grainy , but it works. I melted i down to make lotions</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own lotion for my daughters eczema- it works really well and tempers beautifully</li>
    <li> This stuff was hard as a rock. I&#x27;m not sure how they get away with calling it unrefined, but I returned it. Unrefined shea butter should be soft and pliable, this was like butter that had been refrigerated. Try Better Shea Butter or Raw Apothecary.</li>
    <li> The Shea butter is very creamy. I heated and filtered it before using. There were fine grains of dirt(?) in it as well as what looked like metal shavings in it. I&#x27;m a bit of a germaphobe, so I&#x27;ll admit this makes me a little wary about using it. Heating it made me a little more comfortable about using it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s color was a buttery ivory color, but when I heated it and it hardened it became a greenish color that looks like dirty olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what Shea smelled like. I don&#x27;t like the scent. It reminds me of the smell of a dirty rubber band or plastic. On the skin, the smell seems to dissipate pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I added it to a home made lotion and it really was luxurious.</li>
    <li> I am a review fanatic, I will research a product and its reviews to death before I purchase. And no matter how many stars it has, enough negative reviews will leave me skeptical depending on their severity. This product is absolutely amazing, it leaves my skin extremely soft and shiny and has a nice faint smell. It is hard upon arrival so you do have to scrape or cut some out but once heated or rubbed between hands it softens up quickly and glides right on. I can only speak for myself but this will be my go to product from here on..</li>
    <li> I purchased this butter after doing some research on organic remedies to help heal dry skin and eczema. My 15 months old daughter has a bad case of eczema and this butter works great. After using this butter for about 3 weeks her skin is soft and her eczema has decreased in redness. Our pediatrician said it was fine to use along with prescribe eczema ointment that we use as needed because of the steroids in it. I find that this works better than plain Vaseline and organic coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;The negative thing I have to say about this product is that it is solid hard in the container so you have to let it sit at room temperature for a day or two before you can scrape it up. But you can rub the butter in your hands for a few seconds and it melts. The consistency is still thick and creamy. I like to use it right after a bath so it seals in the moisture. I love the smell of Shea butter which this product delivers on.</li>
    <li> Loved the shea butter. First time buyer and tried to make my own balm for the family. It was easy and feels so great on the skin! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It is very thick.  Have to scrape it out with a knife.  When it is rubbed in, it is fine.</li>
    <li> Great for making homemade soaps. I wouldn&#x27;t expect a soft product as this is a very hard butter, but it melts like...well, butter! It&#x27;s great for soap and lotion recipes that are hot processed since it melts smooth and easy!</li>
    <li> Simply. Amazing. Many products promise results only to leave the consumer disappointed, but this product followed through on its promises and MORE. I chose this brand because it was recommended by a couple trustworthy blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it on my face one night just to see what it&#x27;d be like, and I, kid you not, woke up with ZERO wrinkles and plumper, dewy, and more even-toned skin. I started yelling around the house telling people to look at my face. Due to its amazing results (they truly do speak for themselves), I have had at least 7-10 women (as well as 1 man) ask me to order some for them. As a result, I recently ordered 10 more. Cannot wait to get them in the mail. I&#x27;ve been using it on my body, nails, hair, face, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I have dry/sensitive skin and am quite prone to eczema patches and all sorts of strange things. In the last two years or so, my breakouts have gotten quite bad. However, I feel a sense of hope knowing that this miracle butter exists. I should also mention that a friend of mine with extremely sensitive and oily skin recently tried some of my butter and was completely sold by morning. Her skin is especially stingy and does not respond well to most products. However, she was shocked by how effective this butter was on her skin. Needless to say, she bought 2.</li>
    <li> beautiful soft skin!! :)</li>
    <li> From the top till the middle of the container, the butter is grey in color. The bottom part is cream color. I&#x27;m not sure if it is some sort of fungus growth inside the container or not. It does look like it.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed making my own lotion now, mixing with jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, and Argan oil and Rosehip Oil. Its the best moisturizer you can get!! Instant smooth leg and shinny like baby oil.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter comes in a nice size tub. It is really a high quality product.</li>
    <li> There are so many great things I want to say about this Organic Shea Butter.  First off the company that you order from is great. Quick shipping, prompt follow up emails and they even send you recipes to help you get started making your own lotions and butters.  Second, it is Organic Grade A Shea Butter. Which to me is important. If I am going to make my own products I want them clean and the best product I can buy.  Third the price, at the time it was listed at around $12, but I would still pay much more than that and still be satisfied. You are getting great product and peace of mind knowing the ingredients going into your homemade lotions and butters. You could easily spend triple that buying something already made that is comparable and it might still not be as effective.  Lastly, the recipe for the eczema butter works great! My whole family suffers from extremely sensitive skin and can get rashes and irritations at the drop of a hat. Just rub a little of the body butter on and it is works like a dream. I cannot say enough positive things about this Shea Butter.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for your body and my girlfriend loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not greasy at all, so don&#x27;t let the butter aspect scare you, but it does leave a moisturized shean on your skin for about a half hour before becoming absorbed completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is extremely hard at room temperature, so it&#x27;s not easy to get out of the container and spread on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to scrape some out and then rub it around until it warms up on your skin to spread it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let this steer you away though, as it really works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend, especially for those with problem dry spots.</li>
    <li> Works great in DIY natural beauty products</li>
    <li> My hair is like hallelujah!!! It has been missing the Shea butter</li>
    <li> I heat it up with coconut oil and add a few drops of Eucalyptus Oil. I use it for my face, my hair, and my body. It is great!</li>
    <li> This is so rigid, you can&#x27;t even get it out of the container unless perhaps you use a chisel and hammer.  I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This product was very good to use for my homemade lotion bars. It melted beautifully and the ivory color looked nice after it hardened up. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it&#x27;s great to be able to find this product and have it delivered to my door!</li>
    <li> wonderful product.  Will definitely order again.  thank you</li>
    <li> I melted this shea butter, coconut oil, and bee&#x27;s wax to make lotion bars for my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I believe it&#x27;s improving her skin! (She&#x27;s on a special diet too, so I can&#x27;t say this is the only reason she&#x27;s getting better, though) I used to take coconut oil in a container in my purse but it melts so easily. This bar doesn&#x27;t get messy, so I&#x27;m very glad. I&#x27;ll buy this shea butter again.</li>
    <li> great product, exactly as described. Have used it in numerous homemade beauty products...especially love it in my homemade lip balms!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about Shea Butter. This was my first experience with it. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I made body butter for the first time by mixing this shea butter with almond oil and coconut oil and it turned out great.  It seems greasy upon application but absorbs in so quickly.</li>
    <li> Only reason 4 stars because the plastic tub was cracked . The color is creamy &amp; the smell is nutty , natural smelling not bad , it&#x27;s very hard but does cream up when massaged in hands . Looking forward to mixing it with some oils .</li>
    <li> I use this butter every day when watching TV.  I suffer from peripheral artery disease and so I massage my legs and ankles.  I also have a thickened area on my neck under my chin as a result of radiation for throat cancer.  This damage is probably not going to go away, but I do think it is reduced somewhat.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Shea butter to combine it with coconut oil to make a body butter. It worked fantastically. I love the combination and what its doing to help my dry diabetic skin!!!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!! Amazing product, arrived in perfect condition. First time user of Shea butter (to make my own lotion) and Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice was a great pick. E-book was very helpful and an awesome perk. But most of all....incredible customer service. The team followed up before arrival and after to ensure my satisfaction. Very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It is my first time using shea butter in a diy product and it is lovely.  With nothing to contrast it too, I can only tell you my impressions.  It is thick, creamy and pure. It worked perfectly as I had hoped when I used it in making lip balm.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, wonderful stuff.  I love that it arrived in a sealed bowl with a lid rather than a bag.  My whole family uses it as a skin moisturizer and I use it on the ends of mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s got a bit of a smell to it that my husband hates but I have become accustomed to.  A little bit on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and the frizz is gone and the curls are bouncy :)</li>
    <li> love this product, best quality out there, great price</li>
    <li> makes your skin very soft</li>
    <li> The product was as described.  I used it in making diaper cream, and it emulsified and set up nicely.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does NOT carry the certified organic label.  The only claim to it&#x27;s organic status is the label.  There is nothing else (as per the label) backing up that claim.</li>
    <li> I mixed this to my favorite lotion...I like the texture.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shea butter I have used hands down! I have used many (5-10) different brands. I have bought from the internet to  &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;  retail store products. All these other brands claim to be &amp;#34; unrefined, cold pressed, organic, natural, pure&amp;#34; etc but I will tell you they do not even start to compare to this brand. This was my first order from this company. I ordered because I was desperately looking for something better for my homemade lotions. Here are the positives about this product for me in no particular order. 1. It didn&#x27;t have a strong, weird, chemical odor like some I have tried. 2. It does come in a hard, solid, form but easy to scoop out and very easy to work with because its not  in &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; semi solid form. 3. It comes in a SEALABLE, almost air-tight, plastic container (vs other brands that use an unsealed plastic bag). 4. It makes your skin so soft. I did an experiment and made 2 lotions using the same exact lotion recipe, the only difference being the brand of shea butter. The lotion using this brand turned out totally different in every way (for the better) in smell, color, and texture. It made a silky smooth lotion that was not greasy and I have what I consider normal skin. I believe the difference in the lotions was because it was truly organic shea butter. 5. It is very reasonable priced. DON&#x27;T waste your  money on trying other products like I did, just BUY this one.  6. Quick shipping and excellent packaging. CONS: The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it didn&#x27;t come with the  &amp;#34;Includes FREE 50 Page Shea Butter Reference Guide with over 50 DIY Recipes ($24 Value) recipe book&amp;#34; that was mentioned in the amazon description. I convinced my sister-in-law to order some and she did. She also didn&#x27;t receive the promised recipe book. This is a very minor negative to me as I am fairly knowledgeable on how to use the product. I was a little disappointed I didn&#x27;t get the recipe book as promised because I am always looking for new ways and ideas to use shea butter. If I was a beginner and didn&#x27;t know how to use the product, receiving the recipe book would have been  helpful and important to receive.  Overall, great product in every aspect. I will definitely be buying this again and I will continue to recommend it to others.ause I am always looking for new ways and ideas to use shea butter.

    <li> This product has greatly exceeded my expectations; I use it for skin lotion, lip balm, and for my cat&#x27;s dry ears.  I made glycerin soap and mixed in some shea butter.  It&#x27;s the best soap ever!!  I buy only Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice; it is smooth, pure and not grainy or gritty.  It costs less than retailers&#x27; shea products, because you&#x27;re lucky if those products have 5% shea in them.  This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> This a great Shea Butter that I use it all the time.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome shea  butter,makes your skin happy with nourishment and a healthy glow and soft as cotton. Really clears up pimples and other imperfections, Quality.</li>
    <li> I love this! I use this on my face every day instead of a face lotion. No smell---the kids love it too!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I&#x27;ve never used shea butter before but this one works great.</li>
    <li> Multiple uses!  I received this during a product launch.  When I received this, it was packaged nicely, in a one pound container that seals.  I received the Ivory color.  I have used this plain, as it was received, on my face and hands (it takes a little to soften it), but it soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this along with essential oils to make lotion and body butter.  It has the scent of regular shea butter, not strong or pungent, and when mixed with other ingredients, the scent is easily changed.</li>
    <li> Lovely....kind of gritty but just rub it into the palms of your hands so it can smooth out a bit. I use this for my face hair and body especially the feet. No longer a buyer of lotions. Oil and shea is all I need!</li>
    <li> Huge tub at an excellent price. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely Shea butter.  It is easy to scoop out of the container, therefore easy to use. High quality is important, even on your skin, so I like this one. It has a light earthy scent and that&#x27;s what lets you know it&#x27;s real and pure. I like real, so I like this Shea butter.</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin. My wife uses it alot and she is very happy with this brand</li>
    <li> REAL stuff, makes anything that is dry brand new, feet, elbows, face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought raw Shea butter before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. However, I can confidently say that the quality of this butter is just what I was hoping for. I use it in cosmetic recipes (moisturizers &amp; lip balm). It feels great on my skin - very nourishing. My skin feels so moist and soft. I will definitely be reordering!</li>
    <li> It was my first time using shea butter and I love this product!!!! Its wonderful, works better than the lotion or any kind of moisturizer that I used before. It makes my skin look and feel flawless, its so natural and it lasts forever!!!! I dont need to use any kind of lotion anymore. Great value for the quantity and quality!!!!</li>
    <li> I love love Shea butter. I was so happy to be able to test this product out give you my opinion. The first thing I noticed was that out of the shea butters this one was hard as rock. I took it out used my mixer and that way I was able to soften it. I also divided it into other containers and mixed Oils with it. I do love it and it works well but just know it does come pretty hard. I do know that you get a lot more for your money this way! When I whipped it I got a lot more our of it which is awesome usually I buy it and its soft so this is the real deal my baby loves it also. She needs it for her dry skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and my skin is so much softer and my stretch marks are lightening up</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Leaves skin very soft.  I downloaded the Shea Butter recipes and plan on trying s body scrub!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> this was a very fast delivery and talk about everything I hoped it would be....has done wonders for my husband&#x27;s eczema! Used it on my wind chapped face and it was healed in no time flat....LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> Although Shea butter is supposed to be good for the skin, I find the consistency way too dry and difficult to apply. Can&#x27;t say that I enjoy using it that much.</li>
    <li> Very nice and creamy. The suggestions in the hand book were good. I used a very simple recipe and my family likes the results and is using the cream. We did not notice any unpleasant smells. It has a faint fragrance.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best form of moisture that any type of skin needs. I have both the yellow and ivory kinds (not sure what the difference is) and they save my dry, eczema-prone skin everyday!</li>
    <li> Used for making handmade chapstick. It worked perfectly. Very smooth texture and light smelling.</li>
    <li> This very good shea butter.  I only have one other experience to compare this to.  This shea butter was a little harder and darker in color that my other batch.  It created a very good body butter but it hardens a little fast.  Very high quality and feels great on the skin and lips.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness! I love this stuff. My skin has never felt or looked better!</li>
    <li> excellent  product I&#x27;m completely satisfied,before I use it I have issues with dry skin now is way better.</li>
    <li> This is a great high quality organic shea butter, it is excellent to use on your face or entire body, anywhere you have dry skin. I scrape a little out w/the back of a spoon, hold it in the palm of my hands to warm and soften it up and  then work it into your skin! You don&#x27;t need a lot, it absorbs quickly when using just the right amount.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes a nice base for homemade lotion also</li>
    <li> Very impressed.  I have split with my mom.  I love the feel and it is long lasting.</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with the fact that the shaw butter had been melted down to be packaged. I prefer it in clump form. The product is still good and serves the purpose as a moisturizer for my 4b/c hair.</li>
    <li> Hair. Skin (noncomedogenic, doesn&#x27;t clog pores!!). Body. Also omggggg this stuff is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. They should make raw Shae sticks for your lips. I have chronically dry lips so this stuff has been a life saver. :)</li>
    <li> I mixed essential oils in the the shea butter . It was perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> I brought this to add to soap and lotions I make. It works great as a the primary ingredient. The Shea Butter makes my skin very soft when used in the lotion. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter has been used for centuries in Africa for its healing and moisturizing qualities.&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter is naturally rich in Vitamins E and A and other essential fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. Shea butter is a rich and intense moisturizer for dry skin, and is useful for renewing and repairing damaged skin. I really enjoy using Shea Butters and Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice is a wonderful, quality source of raw, organic Shea Butter. I will definitely purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product as promotional sample in order to test it and express my objective opinion of such.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my skin. Keeps my hair moisturized. Has like a clean smell to it.</li>
    <li> Shea nuts are from a unique species of African tree that lives over two hundred years, Vitellaria paradoxa.  The oil or butter obtained from the nuts is used as a food and has a pleasant, nutty fragrance that is not smoky.  It contains a complex of five fatty acids that are also helpful for the skin:  palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pure organic shea butter is unrefined and has an ivory color.  It is solid but not hard at room temperature and liquefies at body temperature, so it is quickly absorbed by the skin.  It immediately moisturizes and improves the feel and appearance of even very dry, ashy skin.  Apply after bathing to lock in moisture and again whenever needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 16 fl. oz. (475 ml) deli container is completely full and holds about 13.75 oz. (390 g) of shea butter by weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice provided shea butter for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered Shea butter, and I am completely happy with it. Right out of the tub it has a nice warm scent and light texture. A small amount rubbed on skin is easily absorbed and leaves a soft feel and slight shine. I plan to mix it with coconut and almond oil, but haven&#x27;t done that yet. The recipe book is very helpful.</li>
    <li> The shea butter was delivered as promised.  It was harder than I expected, but I have never used it before.  I was able to scoop it out with a spoon.  But it was more crumbly than buttery.  It was easy to handle though when measuring it out.  It melted easily in a double boiler.  I didn&#x27;t notice any particular smell.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the lid will not stay on the container well.  It arrived that way.</li>
    <li> I am a new Shea Butter user so am not sure how other shea butter products are. I do like the smell of Cleopatras Choice Organic Shea Butter. My skin is extremely dry and rough from the Arizona sun. This product is a little grainy which not sure is normal, like i said im new user of Shea Butter, but wow it works great and only a tiny bit needed so definitely will last quite a while</li>
    <li> Hello all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, whipped up the butter like everyone else is trying out. Very rich butter, I mixed it with coconut butter after warming them up of course. Any recipe online will do for showing you the full instructions. I tried it out and my skin has felt a bit better after dealing with the keratosis pilaris ( the chicken/goose bump things on the back of arms) I have had the condition for most of my life and is helping out to smooth the areas affected with it. It isn&#x27;t a one time deal type of thing, it is definitely going to be needed for more than one use. I am trying other brands as well, as this is my first I hope it helps anyone else out there decide on what would be good for themselves as well.</li>
    <li> Great shea butter for an excellent value</li>
    <li> Smells great and very moisturizing. I&#x27;m not even 1/8th finished and I&#x27;m considering buying another one. Positive that this has helped improve my scars</li>
    <li> arrived on time and perfect!</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of Organic Shea butter so have nothing to compare it to, therefore the four stars. Having said that, I am very pleased with the product and have already used it in lip balm and deodorant. Silky smooth! Update: 5/26/15 I love this butter so much, I&#x27;ve just reordered more.</li>
    <li> Too greasy  to use as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Made some scrub with this. Very lovely</li>
    <li> I have order Shea butter MANY times. More often than not, it is not unrefined as stated, smells off, or is horribly packaged. However, this CLEOPATRAS CHOICE Shea butter is absolutely perfect. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described :) I loved making a body lotion with this shea butter!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, product seems high quality. I have never used Shea butter before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to order. I am so glad I chose Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice! I ordered to utilize in a homemade body butter and it worked perfect. I will definitely order this product again. With my order I also received a eBook with Shea butter recipes that sound amazing! I will be trying out some of the different combinations for sure. I am a huge coconut oil fan and I think the combination of both the Shae butter and coconut oil will be fabulous. BTW, the body butter I made is AMAZING! First day and my legs and body are so soft, I feel renewed. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this product, it is is good stuff.</li>
    <li> My container arrived unsealed and really never saw so hard and dark Shea Butter... looked alike a brick.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about shea butter, but this product seems to be what it claims to be. I used it to make natural deodorant, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> not raw. otherwise good. though I don&#x27;t know how high the temperature it was heated to...</li>
    <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
    <li> This was fabulous shea butter!  Perfect for mixing for other body products and used alone and it was great!</li>
    <li> I will b staying with this brand from now on. I have brought sooo many others this brand never disappoints. Love this product</li>
    <li> This was a great product, it is exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> Awesome Shea Butter for making your own lotion!!</li>
    <li> really gives my lip balm a creamy feeling</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Loved the smooth texture, fast delivery !</li>
    <li> This is smooth and creamy nice fragrance. I thought the one I was previously using was the end of my search. This is tops and cost less..</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry and sensitive skin throughout the year. My hands and feet seem most susceptible to dry skin. I moisturize religiously and have a skincare routine. However, Mother Nature seems to have a mind of her own. I have used shea butter infused moisturizers and cream, however, the raw shea butter is by far superior to those products.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product in a securely packaged container. First impression was that this is well worth the money in terms of amount and weight of pure shea butter. I used it on its own or sometimes I mixed in a few drops of essential oil such as peppermint (for my feet) and eucalyptus (for my hands.)&lt;br /&gt;My routine consisted of applying shea butter after shower at night. In the morning, I would wake up with incredibly soft skin. In the week I have used this product consistently, I’ve noticed a difference in my feet and hands. My skin is soft with no dry spots. I’m continuing to use the product on my dry cuticles and face. I think it will make an incredible difference to my skincare routine come winter months when my face dries out.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend adding pure shea butter to your skincare routine. Adding essential oils allowed me to create my own moisturizers. I hope to expand this part of my routine by adding different scents. This product is far more superior to commercial creams and moisturizers with shea butter because they include additives and other ingredients, while not including 100% raw and unrefined shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I find myself using this Pure Shea Butter from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice ALL the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used shea butter prior to this, but I have always heard great things about it. So naturally I was excited to use it. I have found so many ways to use this to my benefit, it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair- I use it in my hair as a treatment, I add a little into my shampoo, and I use it on my ends to protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lips- I use this and some sugar to use on my lips to exfoliate them. I also just use it by itself as a lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin- I use this all over on my skin, after a shower to moisturize, before bed for a over night treatment, the uses are limitless! I use it in the morning as a base for my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many more uses, but that is just a short list to name a few. I love how this feels on my skin. Once I apply it, my skin absorbs it. For the first minute after applying, it might feel a bit greasy, however once your skin soaks it up, that feeling goes away and you are left with soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container that this comes in will give you plenty to last a while. I recommend putting it in the fridge for freezer to extend shelf life. From what I have heard, this can last at room temp for 2 years. Although at the rate I&#x27;m finding uses for mine, it probably won&#x27;t last that long anyways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I give a 5 star rating because it really does moisturize you the way it should be. I personally am not a fan of the smell but that is to be expected from a raw unrefined product. If you can stand the smell of the nuts then this will work just great for you. I personally am only using it on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about this product and my thoughts you can checkout my blog review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://acountrygirlcanreviews.blogspot.com/2014/08/pure-shea-butter-raw-unrefined.html</li>
    <li> Do you still have troublesome dry spots after you use lotion? I used to until I started using Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Shea Butter, no more worries Cleo&#x27;s got you covered. First place I started with was heel of my feet and ankles. Those are my troublesome areas even after using lotion it still leaves them rough and dry. (Tip don&#x27;t dip into the container just lightly glide two fingers over top and gently rub trouble areas). Cause I dipped in and left my heels greasy and had to wipe the excess off with a towel. After experiencing this I made sure not to make that mistake again. So I used a bit less on my elbows they to needed some extra TLC. Even using less it does leave skin bit greasy but soon as it absorbs into the skin(about 1 min), Shea Butter leaves area smooth and non greasy. Courtesy of Tomoson. Full review on blog.</li>
    <li> Having never used pure shea (only having seen it as an ingredient), I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial impression was that the shea butter was very... fragrant ... in a not entirely unpleasant way, just rather unexpectedly strong in an earthy sort of way. Apparently it is normal for good, natural shea butter to be strongly scented, and most products that use raw, organic shea mask the scent with essential oils. The scent was not a problem for me, as my main immediate intention was to use it on my dry rough summer heels and feet in general~ far from my olfactory sensors~ However, the rest of my family wasn&#x27;t quite as excited about that nutty, earthy scent on arms/elbows and hands, so we haven&#x27;t used it widely just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the container it really does look like a tub of butter, with a similar texture to refrigerated butter (but at room temperature). I do plan to order some essential oils to add to the shea butter, whipping it to make a creamier texture for regular use, and possibly making some of my own body butters, combining with coconut oil and other natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality, I have nothing with which to compare, but I can say that using it at night on my horribly rough, dry &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; feet has made a difference, and my feet are much happier (softer and smoother) than they were before the shea butter arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter is a non-clogging, deep moisturizer for skin, containing Vitamins A, E, and F, and I look forward to seeing how it affects my son&#x27;s dry skin, and my husband&#x27;s psoriasis, once I have it properly scented. I love being able to use natural ingredients, avoiding all of the additives that are so unnecessary and often harmful, but so commonly found in many body and skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I cannot begin to express the difference Pure Shea Butter has had on my 5 year old son&#x27;s eczema. The solid texture, at first is a bit mystifying, but once you touch it and begin to emulsify it between your hands it glides on wonderfully. At first it felt a bit thick, but with his scratching, thick is good. It relieved the dry patches, stopped his itching, and sped up the healing time on some of the scabs he had caused previously. We have since made a pint jar of what we call Super Hero Cream by melting some shea butter and mixing in some silver shield.  *Note when melting the shea butter try placing your measured amount in a cup and placing that in a bowl with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also began using the shea butter as a barrier cream for our babies in cloth diapers. It washes out, and I&#x27;ve not had any issues with repealing in our diapers. It&#x27;s left their bottoms as soft as, well a babies bottom.&lt;br /&gt;- See more at: http://collidinguniverse.blogspot.com/2014/09/pure-shea-butter-review.html#sthash.fAz1wEpI.dpuf</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Shea Butter! I ordered it Saturday night around 10pm and received it Monday morning at 10:30 am. Talk about great shipping. I&#x27;ve been using it on my curly hair which on humid days will frizz up but now I can go outside without that problem.  It also makes it easier to comb thru and with hair waist long that is important. It&#x27;s only been a week but using it on my skin in the morning and at night and it feels so soft yet not greasy. I&#x27;m planning on buying more real soon for my daughters and granddaughters. Thanks for such a great product that&#x27;s not full of chemicals.</li>
    <li> The texture is a bit softer than other Shea butter I&#x27;ve purchased from local beauty supply stores. Also, the grade is higher than most you would typically find in your beauty supply/drug store.The scent is very light. The product melts into your skin as you rub it in. It&#x27;s not greasy-you just have to play around with how much is good for your skin. The Shea  butter does leave your skin soft, as other natural skin moisturizers tend to not be heavy enough to keep skin moisturized on their own. Also came with an e-book you can download to your phone just to give you a background on Shea butter and the many ways to apply/use it. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product : )</li>
    <li> wonderful..i read reviews and then decide on my own...I had a little background knowledge.just reading and checking..been using the yellow but the little corner store only sold 1 oz containers so I went to the internet and after a couple links and reading I settled on your company. Praises.</li>
    <li> I just had to have the nicest Shea butter at the best price and that is exactly this product was chosen. For a DIY project which I&#x27;ll be giving as gifts the Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice filled my need. Wonderful product, prompt service.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was as described. Shea butter is high quality and works well in the beauty items I have made. Would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have not used the product yet!  Ask me again in about a month.&lt;br /&gt;Because the texture is so hard and not really easy to use as a body cream, I plan to combine with 2 other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ll let you know later! The little bit I have tried, my body seems to like! Pleasant scent too.</li>
    <li> Very nice Shea Butter. It is not gritty. Just soften it in your palms and use. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Very Nice Shea Butter + nice container (even though it&#x27;s a bit hard to open) This has worked well in my DIY cosmetics.</li>
    <li> wow !! excellent product !! gracias !!</li>
    <li> This is the second brand of organic shea butter I&#x27;ve tried and it is really wonderful!  It is so so so much better than the other brand (which arrived smelling rancid!).  I use it in place of body lotion after showering and on my face and hands at night. It&#x27;s even better than the fancy organic, super moisturizing face lotion I&#x27;ve been using (&amp; loving) for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is softer and more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an allergy to cane sugar - it causes the skin on my fingertips to crack open. Nothing I tried topically prevented it or helped it, until this shea butter. My fingers look and feel great. It healed the cracks overnight, when it usually takes a week or two to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!!</li>
    <li> Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice sent me a tub of this to review and I wanted to tell you guys what I think of it! Since I change my nails so frequently, my cuticles pretty get dried out from the nail polish remover and I&#x27;ve been looking for something to keep them moisturized. I started using this on my cuticles a couple days ago, and they&#x27;ve definitely improved a lot. This is unrefined shea butter so it has a bit of an odor to it, but nothing really offensive. It looks a bit granular straight out of the tub, but after you let it warm up in your hands it smooths right onto your skin. It absorbs really easily into your skin too, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film like a lot of lotions do, I&#x27;ve had problems with that because if you have anything greasy on your bare nails and then try to apply polish, it messes up the wear time of your manicure.&lt;br /&gt;And it came in a huge container, a whole pound of it, so it will last me for quite a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using it on some stretch marks I&#x27;ve had a while, and it made them much less noticeable, but that may be because I haven&#x27;t tried to do anything to reduce them before. It would work great too if your thighs get chaffed from lots of walking, it keeps your skin supple and very moisturized.</li>
    <li> I used it to make soap and it came out fantastic. Love shea butter and this one is of a good quality. Would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed as have product is packed…  Plastic container with a lid that does not seal.  Even a butter tub seals better.  Product tilted and melted, drained out all over box.  Very disappointing</li>
    <li> This product came in a tub type container that had a lid to help keep it fresh. It is solid, kind of like butter you would cook with.  However, I did not have a problem getting some out of the container to test on my hands. I was also surprised at home much came in one container. It will last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff felt amazing. It was very smooth and very slick. My husband called it “an organic alternative to Vaseline,” and this is exactly what it is. My mom has really dry hands in the winter so I will definitely see what I can do to make her some lotion with this. It had an industrial, almost newspaper type smell. It wasn’t bad but adding some essential oils to it would probably make it smell a little less industrial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael (my husband) is a mechanic. He is always looking for different uses for everything. He said that the Shea butter would also make a good mechanical lubricant for putting together gaskets and hoses. In addition, since he is a mechanic, his hands get beat up and become extremely dry. This will be awesome for him to use to help soothe his hands and hydrate them.</li>
    <li> I’m a huge fan of Shea butter, in fact one of my favorites from the drugstore is the Jergens Shea Butter Deep Conditioning Moisturizer. I still love, and use it, but now that I got the chance to try Cleopatra’s Choice pure African Shea Butter, I prefer it over the Jergens. I love it because it’s untouched, its pure there are no fillers, mineral oils, just 100% Shea Butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s so thick, and rich that I recommend that you warm it up with your hands and then apply it on to your skin. It melts just like butter:) It feels amazing! My skin looks healthier, and I don’t know about you but, my face is oily, and the weird thing is my body is not. I have super dry skin, and it can be uncomfortable. All year round I suffer from dry skin, and using Cleopatra’s Choice African Shea butter has helped me a lot! My skin looks, and feels less dry! Oh, and I’m not the only one enjoying this Shea butter. My whole family is using it. My husband noticed that it moisturized his elbows wonderfully. Usually he will moisturize his skin, and then after about an hour he notices that he has to reapply moisturizer on his elbows. That’s not the case when he applies Cleopatra’s Choice 100% unrefined Shea Butter! His skin was moisturized for hours!&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra’s Choice African Shea Butter is one of the best moisturizer’s I’ve tried in a very long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Pure African Shea Butter for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It keeps me soft and Hydrated</li>
    <li> Very please with how much you get... 1 pound! And, a little really does go a long way, this container will last me for awhile. I also like that it is all-natural and not that expensive. It is thick and a little hard, like a bar of soap hard, but I just firmly rubbed my fingers across it and gently pressed it against my skin. At first I had a hard time rubbing it into my skin, but you just have to really rub it in... I got the hang of it. I used it on my driest parts, like my elbows and the heals of my feet. It worked really well. After only a few uses, I really noticed a big difference. The only big downside was that it is really greasy and the label says it&#x27;s not. And, I&#x27;m not talking a little, after I use it, my hands are so greasy that I need to wash them with soap to get it off. And, the places I put it on, I really needed to rub it in, but still had to let dry for awhile before putting on any sort of clothing. It leaves a residue and is very slick. I would recommend only using before bed like I do. Overall, I love that it works. It really does give long-lasting moisture for my really dry skin and it makes my skin smoother. But, it&#x27;s really hard to deal with how greasy it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I mix this with organic oils and use in my daughters natural hair. Love it!!</li>
    <li> My skin loves this butter.  It is making my skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to the term “Shea Butter” when I worked for Bath &amp; Body Works. Which of coarse I soon fell in love with every product that contained Shea Butter. Especially because you can feel the difference, it makes your skin so soft and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus since I already know anything involving “Shea Butter” is going to be an awesome product. Why not discover the source behind all these great products “Pure Shea Butter” &amp; thats why I wanted to share this review with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pure Shea Butter that that I discovered is currently being sold on Amazon &amp; is currently rated #1 on the market. You can use pure Shea Butter for natural relief from dry skin, psoriasis dryness, eczema and acne. (Which is a must for my dry skin and the occasional eczema breakout.) Plus its great for stretch marks during and after a pregnancy. Whats also amazing about this product is that its 100% all natural and organic. Plus as a deep moisturizer for skin, Shea Butter contains vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin F and will not clog your pores. On top of that Shea Butter is highly moisturizing and long lasting so you won’t have to constantly reapply. Pure Shea Butter is an overall awesome beauty product from skin to hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However being that this is an all natural product. The all natural fragrance of pure shea butter is an aquard taste. So in this companies future line I would love to see them come out with a scented shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I was very excited for this opportunity to try this product for myself. On top of that I’m glad I got to introduce “Pure Shea Butter” to my father. When he first saw the product he thought it was at eatable butter &amp; wasn’t going to have any.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this product.  I have sensitive skin, stretch marks and mild eczema. All of these are listed on the product packaging that they help with.  The product has not irritated my skin, a plus.  It has reduced itching due to eczema, a plus.  However, it can takes months to notice even the slightest difference in stretch marks, so it is too soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;I have applied this product all over my body.  The one and only negative that I can see it that it IS indeed greasy.  Its doesn&#x27;t go on greasy, but after rubbing in, even the smallest amount it starts the greasy consistency to form.&lt;br /&gt;That is the one and only negative to this product and it even states on the label that it is non-greasy.  Some people don&#x27;t care about that.  For me,  I apply it at bedtime and it seems to be fine, rather that getting it on my clothes when I dress in the morning.  Overall, I would buy this product again, but it would be nice to be less greasy.</li>
    <li> Just like the site says. It works great and I use it for my hair sealing mixture.</li>
    <li> Good product. will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent, Excellent product. You get SO much for your money and it works great on it&#x27;s own as a moisturizer OR you get so much that you can make your own products. I plan on making my own body butters and cuticle balms with it ASAP! It doesn&#x27;t have any scent to it, so I&#x27;m not afraid to use it on my sensitive skin. I absolutely love this Shea Butter as well as everything else I&#x27;ve ever been sent to review from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice and Adovia! This Shea Butter is awesome!</li>
    <li> This product has been working great so far and it goes as long way!</li>
    <li> I love this product!.... it is very fine quality and is wonderful to use anywhere. ....I use it on my face and it keeps my skin moist with a healthy shine. ..I am in my fifties and it saves me a lot of money on facial over priced products that don&#x27;t work as well as this.....i recommend this product to anyone and feel free to look up the benefits of Shea Butter. ....</li>
    <li> Excellent Shea butter. I&#x27;ve used the Shea butter to make body butter for the family. Everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality! So many uses!</li>
    <li> It feels great on my skin. I wish I had more recipes to use it with.</li>
    <li> Great quality; ships quickly</li>
    <li> Great product -- would highly recommend it for moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have never used Shea butter before so I was not expecting the slight odor that seems to come with all of these butters.  (I have gone to local stores to see if they were the same.)  Love the texture and non greasy feel.  The one and only reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the type of container; a pull-off lid which cracked on the rim when I pulled it off.  I could no longer seal it properly.  The butter is still usable, but I put it all in another type of container.  This is just a time-consuming inconvenience.  Even 5 minutes in a day can be valuable.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m sure this is a good product to use (I bought it based on reviews) it&#x27;s tough to use (get on your finger to spread),</li>
    <li> My eight year old daughter has eczema and is always scratching her arms, legs and belly. We have tried everything. Some things help a little, but not completely. We now use this Shea butter on her skin every time she comes out of the shower. We have seen improvements immediately. Her skin is softer and the eczema is slowly disappearing. She doesn&#x27;t scratch her body like she used to. The good thing is there is plenty of this Shea Butter and it will last us a long time. We have spend tons of money on prescriptions and other products that did not work as well as this product. Will continue to use this product, hoping it continues to improve my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> Once again I am happy to review and talk about a great product from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice. I have never used Shea Butter before, so it was great to be introduced to this 100% organic moisturizer. It came in a 16 oz container, has no fragrance and no chemicals added. You can be confident that when you apply it to your skin you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I started using it the moment I got it in the mail, on my face, on my knees, and on my seven months pregnant belly. I have noticed right away a lot of moisture in this Shea Butter that my body was needing. My knees were really dry, and just after a few days of using it they feel soft and hydrated. My face and belly both feel soft and regenerated.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to apply a big amount to see results. The 16 oz container is meant to keep you for a long time, and it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I love using products with shea butter in it to moisturize my post-menopausal dry skin.  I never knew that pure shea butter even existed until I tried Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Pure Shea Butter.  I received a full pound in my order.  I found that it was better for me to use it at night before I go to bed.  Shea butter uses vitamins A, E, and F and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice uses Grade A, Fair Trade, and sustainably farmed Ghana, African shea nut butter.  It&#x27;s 100% pure, natural, unrefined, and organic.  They offer both ivory and yellow shea butters.  I used the ivory shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter softens my feet in between pedicures and keeps them looking spa fresh.  It  moisturizes my hands so that they look youthful.  My dry skin problem spot is my hips and shea butter keeps them itch-free.  I was able to use it on my sun burn so that my skin didn&#x27;t peel and dry out after staying in the sun too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of many benefits of shea butter are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Shea butter is very effective and helping to prevent stretch marks during and after pregnancy, after significant weight loss, or from the  natural aging process.&lt;br /&gt;  Deeply hydrates and moisturizes dry skin making it softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;  Reduces itching, irritation, and flakiness caused by extremely dry patches of skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Helps reduce skin peeling and irritation from sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;  Helps restore the hair&#x27;s sheen and luster, making it silky and giving it a naturally healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;  Dramatically restores elasticity to the skin and helps to reduce the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;  Great moisturizer for certain skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;  Reduces dryness and flakiness of the scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;  Helps reduce the symptoms of various skin rashes.&lt;br /&gt;  Dramatically softens tough and cracked skin on hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.y recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I tried this Shea Butter free in return for a review of the product. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved that this shea butter was not grainy or gritty. It was smooth, melted easily in my hand and absorbed into the skin nicely. Make sure you don&#x27;t use too much because it will take longer to absorb into the skin and will give you a somewhat oily feel until your skin is able to absorb more. I suggest starting with a small pea sized amount and adding more as you need it until you figure out the right amount for your skin. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the scent, however pure shea butter doesn&#x27;t have a great scent. It&#x27;s more of an earthy scent. That&#x27;s one of the ways you can tell this is a pure, good quality shea butter with no additives. If you&#x27;d like it to smell better you can always use it as an ingredient to make your own body butters, lotions, lip balms, sugar scrubs, etc. As a raw, unrefined product, this is wonderful and does a great job moisturizing the skin.</li>
    <li> I could tell the high quality of the shea butter because my dry and cracked hands were healed within 1-2 days. I also used them on my really chapped lips (somehow, I got chapped lips in the summer). The sensitivity from the redness went away within minutes and my lips looked better within 2 days.  I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the shea butter healed my irritated skin. Unlike other organic and pure shea butters I have tried, this brand absorbed fairly well (no greasy/waxy feeling) and left my hands moisturized for a long time. Of course, this is a butter, not an oil, so it will take time (even up to 20 minutes) to fully absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a recyclable, plastic container with a resealable lid. I would like to see the container be more eco-friendly, like glass. I thought the plastic was a bit cheap (reminded me of Indian carry out containers). Since the shea butter is very thick, I used my finger nail to scoop a bit out. A little shea butter goes a very long way. Be careful how much you scoop out and apply to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I worked in a corporate setting, I would wear skirts and skirt suits year round without pantyhose. Shea butter was great for moisturizing my dry legs during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would not use shea butter on a daily basis, it does have it special uses from time to time. I would use this to help prevent stretch marks during pregnancy, heal dry and cracked skin and lips, and use during the dry winter months for dry/cracked hands. I would highly recommend that Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Organic Raw Shea Butter become a staple of your body care routine for those times when you need to heal the skin or would like long lasting moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample of the product to facilitate my review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are honest and are my own.</li>
    <li> I liked how it made my skin feel so soft and moisturized after it absorbed! It has a very mild fragrance, and it&#x27;s not perfumey. I have even tried it on my heels, and applied sock on it afterwards! Unfortunately, I did not take any pics of the moisturized heels, mine are not sexy or beach-lovely!&lt;br /&gt;I do like it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It came in a plastic tub which I really appreciated, since other natural shea butters I&#x27;ve used came in plastic bags I had to transfer to my own container. This product is best used whipped, I found it rather hard and tough straight out of the container. When mixed with coconut and jojoba oil, it makes for an excellent skin moisturizer and hair sealant!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Came in a  clean package and container.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of shea butter is very good. Would continue to buy it from here.</li>
    <li> I received a 1 pound container of Shea Butter to review, was so happy to receive it because I use alot of it!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few kinds of Shea Butter but I can say that I&#x27;ve used quite a few of the products from Adovia and have been satisfied with them and their costumer service. I use Shea Butter for a lot of my products I make. I am in the process of making a jewel weed salve and am using some Shea Butter in it. I also use it in my lip balms and in some of my other salves! I make a rose salve that I want to try this in, but all the rose petals are gone for the season so I&#x27;ll have to wait til next summer for that!</li>
    <li> I think that this is a great product. My biggest fear was that it was going to be greasy, but it absorbed into my skin rather quickly! I also found that it makes a great makeup remover. i have posted a full review as well as a video demo on my blog if you would like to check it out! http://tiffanybeauty101.com/100-pure-afria…-butter-review/</li>
    <li> I was shocked when I got the Shea butter in, with how much was in the container. One container could last months! You can tell its absolutely pure and organic. I started using it for a week, every night I would apply to my elbows, which are my driest spots, as well as my whole body. With in the next two day&#x27;s I could tell a huge difference. My elbows weren&#x27;t as dry or discolored as before. The thing that I liked was that my legs would stay smooth well into the next day. Only downside I found was the smell. I guess its because its pure with no added smells, but the smell turned me off. My husband didn&#x27;t like it either. Thats why I only put it on at night. Over all, the product works well, and does what it needs to do. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> it has no exfoliete properties. disappointed</li>
    <li> Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice was generous enough to send me one pound of their 100% Pure African Shea Butter for the purpose of this review. I was excited, because I had only recently learned all of the benefits of Shea butter, and many of them apply to me! My skin is combination skin and has been going through some rough patches, literally. At the same time, I am combating little patches of acne that have decided to magically invade my life now that I am already in my twenties (?). On top of that, my hair is coarse and dry to begin with, and heating it with a straightener to remove my unruly waves only increases the damage. I knew that Shea butter was useful for all of these things, and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Shea butter is very high-quality. Many people complain about the smell, but you have to remember, this is a raw product -- how do you think all those nice shampoos and conditioners get their scents? By adding in additional ingredients, most of the time chemicals. If you want what is best and most nutritionally beneficial to your skin, unrefined and organic Shea butter is the way to go. I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell.. it is, to me, very subtle and non-irritating. It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but it isn&#x27;t horrid, or anything. It is earthy and nutty. This Shea butter is easy to apply, and I ended up using it on my face (especially where I have acne spring up), on my dry hands, and on my damaged hair. A lot goes a little way, so you really don&#x27;t have to apply a ton. It is only slightly greasy when you first apply it, but not enough to clog up your pores or irritate your skin. In fact, it does the very opposite -- it has a moisturizing, soothing feel that really sinks into your skin. It doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as oils and serums, but it does a wonderful job of hydrating. I applied the Shea butter to the tips of my hair, where I tend to get split ends. My hair looked shiny and new after a few days, because it was actually retaining moisture! I really think my dry skin has been improving as well. I can&#x27;t wait to see what this does for my stretch marks. Many have already faded, but I would like to see if this could help dull the color of the more purple stretch marks. I think this is a wonderful and versatile product, because there are so many uses for it. Not only can you use if for skin and hair...you can also use it as an ingredient to make your own soaps and lotions. You can even use it as a lip balm! I could really see myself using this on my cracked/dry lips in the winter.</li>
    <li> I can say that it does moisturize and I like that it comes with a reusable container. The shea butter I received has a strong unpleasant smell to it that to me does not resemble the nutty smell I was expecting and the texture is dough like and gritty. Different from other raw shea butters I have used. It does melt down nicely though. The smell is just something I can not get used to.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and in a nice neat container, not as a random chunk like some brands. It is a beautiful texture and smells heavenly. I use the Shea as part of my home made skin care items, but also directly on skin. A little goes a very long way. I received a discount to try the product, and I adore it! I have already recommended to friends and family who also make home skin care. I have purchased shea before and at about the same price, but Cleopatra&#x27;s was superior quality.</li>
    <li> *Disclaimer: I received this for review. Opinions expressed are completely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment of the shea butter was very fast. The shea butter smells very natural and is feels very soothing on the skin. It is not greasy at all. I&#x27;ve been using the butter more on my lips and this product has helped keep them very moist. I&#x27;ve also been putting the butter on my daughter who has eczema. The shea butter really absorbs well into the skin and adequately provides moisture to her skin. Within a few days of using the shea butter, I&#x27;ve seen improvements in her skin. Overall I am very happy with the product, I love how natural the product is and how moisturizing it leaves the skin feeling.</li>
    <li> This raw Shea Butter comes in a huge one pound jar.  I have dry skin especially my feet.  I have been using it on my feet, my hands, stomach and legs.  You just have to warm up a little in your hands and then apply.  It is a great moisturizer and is not greasy.  I have been reading about all kinds of recipes to make my own Shea butter.  I am going to try a couple different recipes.  It has so many uses.  I like to apply right after taking a shower.  I did receive this complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newby at diy skin care. I used it to make a face cream. It is a bit too sticky , and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb well. I won&#x27;t give up. Am still figuring out how to make stuff. I love it on my feet though!</li>
    <li> Raw shea butter is the new trend. There is so many things you can do with shea butter. I am going to touch on a couple in this review. I first need to tell you mine came in frozen solid. Do not let that make you think it is ruined. What i did first was let it come back to room temp for a 48 hrs after I got it. I am sure you are thinking why not warm it in a micro. You can do that but I would rather let nature bring it back to life. Now if you are making soaps you would need to let it melt so you can use it with essential oils to make it. .I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! Another thing you can do with it is makeup products. I have made a lip balm so far. For more ideas why not type in raw shea butter idea what to make with it. You will get so many ideas. I have also added this to a basic moisturizer for the skin. I have really dry skin currently and this is helping so much with this. So I would have to say this is all over body option of a product. You can use it from head to toes.</li>
    <li> I received one pound of 100% Natural and Organic Pure Shea Butter to review!  It&#x27;s made with the finest hand selected nuts of the shea tree in Ghana, then packaged in a resealable container for easy access and storage.  The Shea Butter is AWESOME!  I mix it with coconut oil and essential oils, it definitely makes your skin feel moisturized and well nourished!  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for skin and hair, with the vitamin A, Vitamin E and Vitamin F.  What makes this butter, the perfect moisturizer is that it does NOT clog pores.  It&#x27;s highly moisturizing and long lasting, which makes it beneficial for hair and skin health.  The best part of all, is that it&#x27;s Free of parabens, sulfates and petroleum, plus being Cruelty Free!</li>
    <li> Works good but comes as a huge hard lump shaped like the container. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that..</li>
    <li> I love shea butter, it&#x27;s great on dry, winter skin.  I&#x27;ve had both the yellow and the white shea butter, and I like the white better.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Works great for my skin soft smooth loving it so far</li>
    <li> Disappointed, hard  as a brick  when  I  received  it.</li>
    <li> It was such a good smell, I used on my hair and body.It was hard , but soon softened up.I love that is 100% and Natural.</li>
    <li> I received a code to try this shea butter free through BuView, and oh my word, am I glad I did! This is the real stuff--pure shea. At first it looked odd to me since I&#x27;m used to using shea mixed with other things and was not expecting a solid block. Once I figured out how best to dispense it, I fell in love with how it felt on my skin... And I may have gone a little overboard and put it everywhere--my feet, lips, face, eyelids and undereye, cuticles, and the top of my infant&#x27;s head!! But since it&#x27;s organic, all natural, non-greasy, and not pore-clogging, it&#x27;s all good! I can already see this replacing existing products in my skin care routine... And my subsequent repurchasing of this stuff in bulk.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!  I make a lot of soap, this is a perfect ingredient for the addition of my soaps.  The container is packed nicely.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have never used raw shea butter until now and now I will not be using anything else. The product is scent free and theres so much of it!  A little goes a long way.  My son who is 5 years old has horrible dry skin.  His little face and ears and arms are nothing but bumpy and dry.  We just used this for a couple of days and it was like a different child.  His skin was soft and his little pimples started to go away.  Ive mixed it with some essential oils and it helps the feet and hands as well. Thank you so much for allowing me to experience this product. You now have a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I purchased to make lotion bars and worked great. A great buy that I will use again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I was reading the reviews, but this product delivered. I suffer from dry skin and this shea butter leaves my skin feeling soft and supple without any greasy residue. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> just received.. cant wait to use this to make some muscle relief creams for my mother and some skin creams for myself!</li>
    <li> So far, So good! Id suggest wearing it at night as it has a funny smell but it feels great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shea butter. leaves skin silky smooth and shiny. doesnt leave that oily / grease feeling. dry spots have improved.</li>
    <li> Wonderful butter.  Smooth &amp; silky feel &amp; extremely moisturizing.  I love using this is my natural homemade products.  I also love the resealable container.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for both lip balm and lotion bars and it makes both feel so luxurious!</li>
    <li> Very soft and moisturizing!  The BEST Shea Butter I have used to date!</li>
    <li> While Shea butter has a ton of great uses, I actually specifically used this at night before bed. It absorbed during the night while I slept and I woke up with the softest skin possible. Have absolutely loved this shea butter. It has really made my skin it&#x27;s healthiest and most hydrated self possible.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Received discount for purchasing and so glad I did.  Made my skin very soft and even at reg price is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived promply. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like it! A good amount came in that container great for mixing with my oils to make lotion or oil lotion bars. It works better then most moisturizers that you can buy in the store.</li>
    <li> I had the privilege to try the Organic Shea Butter by Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice. This product is wonderful for many things such as treating skin problems, including blemishes, wrinkles, itching, sunburns, small skin wounds, eczema, skinn allergies, and insect bites. I love to apply it to the many rough places on my body such as my elbows ankles knees and hands. This Shea butter is organic and you can tell by the all natural fragrance it has.&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with the Shea butter was wonderful. I took a long hot shower made sure to dry off completely and then I took about a big table spoon of the butter and gently massaged it into my skin. My skin absorbed the butter and there was no greasy resedue left. If you suffer from dry skin this would be the perfect moisturizer for you especially if you are looking for an all natural product.</li>
    <li> My first time buying shea butter.  I bought this brand on the recommendation from a friend.  It arrived promptly.  The quality is excellent.  It is soft and luxurious!  A treat for my skin!  Can&#x27;t wait to put together some recipes for myself and my family.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry and sensitive skin throughout the year. My hands and feet seem most susceptible to dry skin. I moisturize religiously and have a skincare routine. However, Mother Nature seems to have a mind of her own. I have used shea butter infused moisturizers and cream, however, the raw shea butter is by far superior to those products.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product in a securely packaged container. First impression was that this is well worth the money in terms of amount and weight of pure shea butter. I used it on its own.&lt;br /&gt;My routine consisted of applying shea butter after shower at night. In the morning, I would wake up with incredibly soft skin. In the week I have used this product consistently, I’ve noticed a difference in my feet and hands. My skin is soft with no dry spots. I’m continuing to use the product on my dry cuticles and face. I think it will make an incredible difference to my skincare routine come winter months when my face dries out.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend adding pure shea butter to your skincare routine. This product is far more superior to commercial creams and moisturizers with shea butter because they include additives and other ingredients, while not including 100% raw and unrefined shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using .tomoson.Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how much Raw Shea Butter was sent to me to try out. I was given 1lb of it to try complimentary which is fantastic. With only using a dime sized amount for lotion on my husbands feet, I will never run out. I am still branching out and slowly trying it with other uses such as conditioners and make-up. You can add essential oils to it or add a dollop to your bathtub to make the water smooth. There are hundreds of uses for raw shea butter and since this is unrefined from Ghana, it is refreshing and natural. There are no added scents to it so it just smells, well, like nothing in general. There is a small &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell to it but it is nothing bad. I have used it in a few different ways and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the butter. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out in other ways and see what I like best but so far I definitely think everyone should go out and buy this!</li>
    <li> I have used several different shea butters in the past but have not tried 100% pure shea butter. Like most reviewers said, it does take some time getting used to the product. You do have to scoop the product out and warm it between your fingers or hands before applying. I&#x27;ve only used this when coming out of the shower and it keeps my skin hydrated and moisturized without a sticky or filmy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is 100% natural and organic pure shea butter hand selected from the finest nuts of the Shea Tree in Ghana. It is a deep moisturizer for skin and contains vitamin A, E, and F. It won&#x27;t clog pores and is supposed to provide relief from dry skin, psoriasis, eczema, acne and stretch marks due to pregnancy. I did some additional research and pure shea butter is also supposed to help fade old and new scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any scars or dark spots fading. Hopefully with continued use, it will diminish.  There isn&#x27;t really a strong scent. It smells just like nuts.  I&#x27;m used to using lotions and creams that are scented so using this does take some getting used to. There is a lot of product and this will definitely last a long while. It comes in a one pound resealable package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> As I get older, it feels like my skin and hair are getting drier every day!  It also doesn&#x27;t help that I live in a high desert.  So, I was thrilled to be able to review Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice brand 100% Pure African Shea Butter, sold by Adovia Mineral Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;I received a one pound tub of Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice 100% Pure African Shea Butter in the ivory color (yellow is also available).  It is packaged very well, in a sturdy hard plastic recyclable tub with the label on the lid.  The smell of the Shea Butter is not unpleasant, but natural- to me it smells similar to play-doh.  The Shea Butter itself is thick, creamy, and smooth.  I have used it on everything-my lips,  hair and skin.  It is wonderful!  I used it on a curling iron burn the other day and it was so soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Shea Butter is the #1 rated Shea butter on the market, and is 100% natural and organic. It is made with the finest nuts hand selected from trees in Ghana.  It contains vitamins A, E, and F and does not clog pores.  Pure African Shea Butter is used for everyday skin and hair moisturizing, as well as for Eczema, Psoriasis, very dry skin, and stretch marks.</li>
    <li> The shea butter is a great quality. For me the nutty odor was a bit strong, I know this is typical of raw shea butter. My husband suffers from psoriasis and we were hoping this would be helpful. It seems to be as effective as his prescription. He did feel it was too greasy and will use it when his psoriasis is controlled to prevent flare ups. I was happy to receive this to try free from Cleopatras Choice and Tomoson.</li>
    <li> Helps dry and itchy areas. My only concern is the odor - it is not unpleasant and is not too prominent, but you are aware of it.  For winter skin, it is great and feels good.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The shea butter itself is really nice but it came in a plastic container that was cracked and the top won&#x27;t stay on because of how big the crack is. Also, it just didn&#x27;t come with the shea butter reference guide it mentioned which was part of the reason I ordered this specific one in the first place.</li>
    <li> So far its been working quite well. Although the scent wasnt as plesant as other butters thats easily solved. I plan on making a whipped shea butter mask with scented essintial oils for my hair. It has so many uses. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Very thick. Different scent than I had imagined. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great natural shea butter. Regarding the smell: it has a smoked paprika smell to it which is not as repulsively pungent as some reviews would have led me to believe. I rather enjoy the aroma especially since it is not masked by chemical fragrance. It also absorbs into skin quite well leaving it velvety smooth.</li>
    <li> Great quality, and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> It is very nourishing to my eczema. However I did not get the \\&quot;free book\\&quot;. :(</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing Shea Butter and I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> I ditched my conventional lotion for this! I&#x27;m not very knowledgeable about Shea Butter yet (still learning) so I can&#x27;t have a lot of words about the quality of this Shea Butter, but to me it does the job well. It has a pleasant nutty aroma that sometimes I just wanted to take a spoonful and stuff it in my mouth (but I didn&#x27;t). I will be using this in my DIY skin care and cosmetics. Overall I am very satisfied with what I received. Will be order more in the future.</li>
    <li> It is a little tough to get out of the container  but once in your hands it warms up so you can spread it. It is greasy feeling at first but quickly absorbs in.  I have extremely dry skin and this stuff is awesome.  I love Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice thank you!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter; it is very rich and is great for chapped hands. I also massage it into my cuticles &amp; the rough places on my feet.</li>
    <li> This product surprised me - it has done a wonderful job of eliminating my constant hangnails!  And I used it right from the tub. Amazing. I&#x27;m anxious to try the recipes so I can use this as a body butter. For skin care, it&#x27;s my new best friend!</li>
    <li> Love CC shea butter. Use to moisturize entire body. Mix shea butter with a few drops of essential oil and massage on feet at night. Put socks on, leaves feet soft and smooth. Use as an facial cream, minimizes wrinkles. It tames flyaway hair and frizzies.</li>
    <li> I got Pure Shea Butter for my review. I see many times as my female coworkers from Caribbean applying all over body but I have never tried and finally I got my jar.&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Brand meets all my expectations. Deeply Moisturizing Shea Butter from Africa is 100% organic, raw and unrefined. Made from highest quality shea nuts used for skin or hair: dry skin, stretch marks, eczema, and psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;Opening jar I found out that butter is quite hard, like a hardened bar of soap, but melts very gently in hands. Once you start to put it on my body heat just melted it and so it was super easy to put on. Effect after using of Shea butter is amazing. I love it! It moisturizes my skin for all day. Additional, you feel have a HUGE jar that will give you beautiful skin for very long time. I have used to use all over my body, including feet and it make miracle to my dry feet. Also I have used easy touches to ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am not big fan of scent but knowing that is 100 % organic product I have no complains. Highly recommend to everyone who thinking about healthy skin.</li>
    <li> Rather large tub of 100% natural and organic Shea is perfect for mixing with other ingredients and making skin gifties. I ordered some scents and plan on mixing them in with this shea butter and some coconut oil to make it smell delicious. I love that it is raw for the creativity in me. Thick, and sumptious, shea butter is perfect for conditioning all kinds of skin. I love it. This has no scent, but you can add in and make it smell like whatever you want.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and it is very hard for me to find lotions or creams that will keep me moisturized all day. Cleopatra&#x27;s choice raw shea butter  provided me the moisture I needed to leave my skin smooth. A  little goes a long way with this shea butter.  I am so glad that it came in a resealable tub.  Not only do I use the shea butter in my biggest dry skin spots such as my elbows and knees, I also use a little bit of shea butter on my lips and it keeps my lips moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;This raw shea butter  has a very light fragrance . I would compare it to a slight nutty woodsy scent. I prefer more stronger scents so I have mixed some of the shea butter with vanilla essential oil to give it a nice smell.  The great thing about this raw shea butter is that you can mix it with any scent you want if you don&#x27;t like the natural scent it has.&lt;br /&gt;I used this shea butter on my daughters skin when she had her eczema  breakout and it stopped her itching. My boys don&#x27;t always like me putting all kinds of lotion on them and with this shea butter I just put it on them after their shower and it lasts all day.  I am glad I tried out Cleopatra&#x27;s choice raw shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Pure African Shea Butter for review purposes. However, all thoughts and  opinions expressed are 100% my own *</li>
    <li> The shea butter itself seems quite nice: it&#x27;s soft, clean, and smells fine. I took off two stars because the container is supposed to have 16 oz of shea butter, but it really only has 14 oz. I feel kind of cheated.</li>
    <li> I have never used Shea Butter before so I was unsure of what to expect. I used this product in a homemade body butter and it turned out great.</li>
    <li> Perfect for extra dry skin patches or dry skin in general. Soothes skin immediately, especially now in winter time. Great product for allover skin treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this brand of Shea butter is a wonderful product, but the texture is so awful that I never want to use it. It was unusually firm when I first received it. Now that I&#x27;ve broken in to it, it&#x27;s crumbly and gets everywhere. Maybe I got a bad batch? I can&#x27;t wait to finish it off so I can purchase a more creamy variety.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff in my moisturizer bars!  Great for your skin</li>
    <li> love how moisturizing this is!  A lot of times when you purchase things they don&#x27;t come completely full, but this tub was completely full!  Got it super fast and just really happy with it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this to make some homemade organic lotions and deodorant.  It is very nice quality and consistency.  Smells and feels wonderful.  I will order again in the future and would highly recommend.  Thank you for the great deal!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:be63f40204e5cb1dbb4bb46da491f052]]Shea butter comes in a color from deep yellow to white. The smell is distinct. This actually smells like every shea butter that I have come across before. It is what you would consider \\&quot;raw\\&quot; and \\&quot;pure.\\&quot; This means there are no unnecessary additives in this product. That leads it to be safer to use as well as longer lasting on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things you will notice once you open the container:&lt;br /&gt;Ivory color&lt;br /&gt;Completely smooth surface&lt;br /&gt;Typical shea butter smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues you may come across being new to pure shea butter &amp; how to resolve them:&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter comes as a solid and is not easy to maneuver out of the container.&lt;br /&gt;  -Take a spatula or some other item and \\&quot;dig\\&quot; out chunks of the shea butter until it is of a texture that is easily pliable and ready to use when needed.&lt;br /&gt;The smell. It is not something that your nose is used to or agrees with.&lt;br /&gt;  -With this being pure shea butter, feel free to add your oils to the mixture with no issues. Also, reflect back on the e-book you received.&lt;br /&gt;You are uncomfortable with the color and doubt its purity based on the color.&lt;br /&gt;  -Shea butter comes in colors from deep yellow to white. What I received was ivory. This is normal. There are no additives in the shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this product. Looking for a shea butter solution or curious to try? Better to start with the best grade out there. This is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product specifically to review it.</li>
    <li> So many uses for this! I have been primarily using this as  a lip balm and moisturizer for my hands. All I do is take my index finger, swipe it lightly on the butter in the tub and I can use it on my lips and my cuticles. The skin around my finger nails gets brittle, dry and chapped from dishes and winter. This takes care of it. I use so little to take care of so many areas;  I can see this tub lasting a LONG time. There is no smell whatsoever and it is completely organic. What could be better? I have to secure a few more ingredients to make body butter and scrub with this product; there are so many ways to use this! Very glad I was given the opportunity to test and try this product. I am a fan , for sure.</li>
    <li> This is not just another one of those skin care products that you see advertised all the time.This is organic shea butter,raw African shea butter.This shea butter is made from the finest nuts of the shea tree in Ghana.I was happy to give my opinion on this product.This is one of the best shea butter that is out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use this in many different ways.Experiment with it and see what you can come up with that you really like.It is great for your hair also.If you have that dry hair all the time and looking for a great conditioner give this try and see how much softer your hair fills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this on your skin and see how amazing your skin will feel after a few times of using.It is great on the heels of your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a 1lb jar and is packaged in a reusable or recyclable container.It also comes with a Free 50 page ebook with over 50 DIY Recipes.&lt;br /&gt;I believe if you try this that you will truly like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try making my own body butter. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to do that yet and now I am not sure I will. I opened the package as soon as a got it and scraped out a tiny bit and rubbed it on a dry patch on my elbow. A few hours later I felt my elbow and it was completely smooth and soft. I was amazed it worked so quick. My husband has horrible dry feet no lotion or cream ever seems to help them. I took a small amount of this shea butter and massaged it into his feet before bed, the next morning his feet were smother than I have ever seen them. Like I said I initially purchased this to make body butter but I am very happy with the results of it on its own and probably will just continue to use it that way.</li>
    <li> nice quality product !</li>
    <li> best stuff ever. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This has been a miracle cure for me. Since starting to go swimming 2 days a week, I&#x27;ve found that the skin on my face and my hands has become very dry, to the point where it has started to become sore and cracked in places. This has affected my ability to do general day to day tasks and in cold winter months it is unbearable. I tried many different creams and lotions with a little to no help. I needed something more effective. After some research I ordered this Shea butter. This is no man made cream - everything about it is completely natural. I have really grown to love the smell. I use this after I get out of the shower on top of coconut oil and body lotion. I take a tiny bit and rub in my palm, it melted easily and I was able to apply to my skin. It just helps to lock and seal everything in my skin. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin super smooth all day. After only a few days the skin feels more or less completely healed. Shea butter is a great moisturizer, amazingly good for itchy, sore, flaky skin, and wrinkles.  I have noticed a huge difference in my skin over the past few weeks. It&#x27;s smoother and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Love it. Such a great deal!!!</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is really authentic demonstrated by the color, texture and scent. I had no issues with the packaging and delivery. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used. It feels great on my skin, and you get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> I ordered to use in some formulas from my new book. Haven&#x27;t made it yet. Product seems very good.No problems with this product</li>
    <li> This shea butter is top notch.The people over at Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice go ABOVE and BEYOND! They are an amazing company with an incredible product and unparalleled customer service! I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future for sure :)</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a pure, organic, cold pressed, unadulterated Shea Butter at an amazing price, then you will find it in this product.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a one pound tub of this sumptuous natural Shea butter, and couldn&#x27;t wait to open it and begin using.  It is beautiful in it&#x27;s purity and simplicity.  Pure Shea butter has so many skin, hair and nail uses, if your not familiar with it, I suggest you look it up.  It is one of the very few pure oils that will Not clog pores.  A very beneficial ebook comes with this order.  Yes, in this pure unadulterated form, it is harder than a cream or lotion.  But great things come to those who wait and have a little patience.  I use a wooden coffee stir to glide over the top to get out just enough for use.  I use it at night after my shower for an all night body moisturizer, and a once a week hair wrap conditioner.  It melts and easily smooths as soon as it touches your skin.  Yes, it&#x27;s thicker, so give it a minute to absorb.  The benefits are so worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! I have never used shea butter before, but I&#x27;ve used it every single day since I received it! I&#x27;ve made homemade deodorant from this as well as lip balm! It&#x27;s fantastic - very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I love shea butter its probably one of the most natural ways to moisturize without using lotions that have harsh chemicals.  This was a fantasic find at an introductory price and in return i am able to give my unedited opinion .. i love this on the knees elbows and feet, you can add your own scent to it as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I know it&#x27;s supposed to be used to make bath and body products but I&#x27;ve been using it straight out of the tub and I love it!  I have terrible dry winter skin; my hands crack and peel.  Just in two days&#x27; time my hands have shown a tremendous improvement.  It feels greasy at first but it absorbs quickly and just leaves your skin soft.  Really can&#x27;t say enough good things!  If you have dry skin then you need this in your life!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the Organic Shea Butter.  It whipped up easily and mixed well when I made a dry skin cream. The packaging was good and the service was prompt.</li>
    <li> I ordered the ivory shea butter. Made wonderful butters and creams with this! This was my first time ordering from this company and I was very impressed with this product. The shea butter was moist and soft to touch. I would definitely order from here again and have since recommended this to family and friends!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! The smell is mild, no staining and it works really well!</li>
    <li> I have been using this about 2 weeks now and love it. My face feels very soft after using it and stays feeling soft long after putting it on. I use it at night before bed and daytime use.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff to make body butter, but this came with an awesome recipe book with lots of ideas and I will probably try one or two. Thanks again for the best deal and high quality product</li>
    <li> Have ordered this directly from the company for a long time. Nice its on Amazon now. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Works great for dry skin.  This container will last a long time.  I use it right from the container.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for my dry skin. My knees have never looked so good.</li>
    <li> Very please with how much you get... 1 pound! And, a little really does go a long way, this container will last me for awhile. I also like that it is all-natural and not that expensive. It is thick and a little hard, like a bar of soap hard, but I just firmly rubbed my fingers across it and gently pressed it against my skin. At first I had a hard time rubbing it into my skin, but you just have to really rub it in... I got the hang of it. I used it on my driest parts, like my elbows and the heals of my feet. It worked really well. After only a few uses, I really noticed a big difference. The only big downside was that it is really greasy and the label says it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product on a discount price or free for reviewing purposes</li>
    <li> Wow!  I am so impressed with this product.  This winter has really done a number on my families skin.  My husband suffers from eczema and my daughter has unfortunately taken after him.  They get so unbearably itchy and we had tried a number of remedies, none of which worked as effectively as we hoped.  But this worked wonders!  It calmed their itchy irritated skin and brought mine back from itchy flakey dry skin, to soft and smooth, comfortable skin.  And it isn&#x27;t just great for winter skin!  You can also use it in a recipe to make a natural sunblock!  I am very much looking forward to using this rather than the nasty chemicals in store bought sunscreen.  There are literally an unlimited amount of uses for this amazing shea butter!  It is a GREAT buy, and I would highly recommend it.  I was lucky enough to receive this product at a steeply discounted price so that I could test and review it.  The seller was not promised a positive review and the opinions I have stated are 100% my own unbiased opinions.</li>
    <li> The organic shea butter that I purchased is absolutely wonderful. I have Psoriatic Arthritis and have alot of trouble with my skin. Dryness, scaliness and wrinkling skin is what I am left with. This shea butter actually helped with my skin problems, the dryness has minimized to practically being not dry anymore, the wrinkles are minimizing wonderfully as well. The scaliness from the psoriatic arthritis has improved greatly as well. Most of my major problems are in my feet with the psoriisis. I have been lathering down my feet at bedtime and wearing socks and my feet are getting softer (and prettier) with each treatment. I would recommend this product for anyone with dryness, psoriasis and early wrinkles. I gladly give this product five stars!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had something better to say, and maybe I just didn&#x27;t know what to expect of shea butter, but I don&#x27;t really like it.  I find it very hard, very greasy and smells bad.</li>
    <li> Although I like how smooth it makes my skin feel I don&#x27;t like how thick it is.  Makes it hard to spread on.  But love how soft my skin feels after I get it on</li>
    <li> I love this!  I bought this with the intention to use it in my hair because it is dry by nature. The texture of the butter is hard, but you just have to mix it with something else to make it more manageable. I mixed it with some olive oil and it worked great. I only use a bit at a time because you don&#x27;t want to put too much on your hair either. It has made my hair so soft and beautiful. This tub is going to last me a long time but I do plan on getting more when it&#x27;s gone. I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Organic Shea Butter is a great moisturizer when you need to pull out the big guns - I have been using this on my feet which have some SERIOUS problems with drying and cracking then putting on a pair of white cotton socks before I go to bed at night.  Attractive yes I know - but a girls gotta do what she must! After about a week my feet were in much better shape and I switched to every other night which seems to be the right frequency to maintain smooth soft feet.  This is a large amount and comes in a nice container instead of the usual zip lock bag which I appreciate.  If you make lotions and potions I would recommend this as it is a top quality Grade A Shea butter.</li>
    <li> great quality shea butter.  used it to mix up some lotions and chapsticks.  works great!</li>
    <li> I have yet to use it in my salves and lip balm but I like the way it looks and feels on my skin. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I haven&#x27;t really used it yet.</li>
    <li> After using it, it works just like Shea butter has for me in the past. A little bit goes a LONG way. Will I use it for my go-to moisturizer? No. I have never loved the overly-heavy feeling of Shea butter, and I do think that it feels greasy when applied. That being said, I am happy to have it on hand to use for really dry-skin days, as well as a carrier &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; to mix with my essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did not have this brand, I will say that I loved using Shea butter on my stomach during my pregnancy, not that it necessarily helped with stretch marks (which is totally genetic, by the way), but that it really helped me on my itchiest days (which were quite often during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters).&lt;br /&gt;-improves many skin conditions: blemishes, wrinkles, eczema, dermatitis&lt;br /&gt;-treats skin allergies, insect bites, sunburns, frostbites&lt;br /&gt;-treatments for extreme dry and cracking skin&lt;br /&gt;-uses as a lip balm&lt;br /&gt;-put under lipstick to keep it in place&lt;br /&gt;-mix with a hair conditioner for a deep hair treatment&lt;br /&gt;-put on feet before you put on socks&lt;br /&gt;-apply to your belly to reduce stretch marks (before, during, and after pregnancy)&lt;br /&gt;-use on cuticles&lt;br /&gt;-rub on insect bites to help relieve itchiness&lt;br /&gt;-apply to paper cuts to reduce the risk of scar or pain&lt;br /&gt;-use as a hair sculpture gel&lt;br /&gt;-use as a carrier oil with your favorite essential oils</li>
    <li> I Love this Shea Butter! Very creamy and moisturizing. Great for dry skin. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> My family have dry skin no matter what lotions I use so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how this may help.   Update: I am in love with this stuff and I will likely never buy regular lotion again! Skin is super soft and glowing, even on my face! My problem dry spots around my nose and forehead are a thing of the past!</li>
    <li> This product is great we&#x27;ve been using it for about a week on my dry skin and my daughter&#x27;s eczema and we&#x27;ve seen a big improvement. I&#x27;m a nurse so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and during the winter my hands are severely dry and cracked and they just hurt, my husband is a truck driver and has the same problems but since we started using this Shea butter everyday after our nightly shower we&#x27;ve seen a major change in the softness of our hands and a major change in the severity of our daughters eczema.</li>
    <li> Nice feeling. Will be great for lots of things.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the product however very hard to get some on fingers to apply to body.</li>
    <li> Great product love it.</li>
    <li> So nice for making homemade beauty products!</li>
    <li> This ia great! It comes in a container that seals pretty good so no drying out. The scent is pretty good. It is a good relief if you have dry skin. Its pretty thick and solid in the container and goes on very well. Im very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This  Shea Butter works very well.  I anticipated a more lotion creamy version but it is more solid spreads on and keeps your skins very smooth a great product.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is amazing! The large size definitely goes a long way and I love the ebook included which provided some great DIY beauty products.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was quite surprised at the amount I got ( quite pleased! ) as I like to make my own lotions and lip balms this is great.  The scent is very subtle to me.  I will certainly enjoy using this!</li>
    <li> Great product, nicely contained and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Works great used it to make lotion bars</li>
    <li> This organic Shea butter is wonderful. Great quality. I would definitely recommend it to other diy home and beauty product makers.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Great value!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Love it. We use it with essential oils mixed in and it works great.</li>
    <li> Just as described and quick delivery.  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is awesome shea butter!! It works great!!</li>
    <li> My daughter in law swears by this!!  She is using this on her legs and she said they have never looked better!!</li>
    <li> I am new to the world of DIY beauty products but it is fun, saves money, and lets me control the ingredients. We used this shea butter to make a &amp;#34;beard balm&amp;#34; for my husband. When he had his beard he really loved it. The beeswax in the recipe helped control the hair but the shea butter is what really helped to make it feel softer. He has since shaved the beard but we use the balm as a moisturizing hard lotion now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how versatile shea butter is. We can use it in our DIY recipes but also use it right out of the tub for a deep conditioning hair treatment or a quick dab on my infant daughter&#x27;s bottom during a diaper change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice is very affordable compared to other shea butters and seems to be very high quality as well. A little bit goes a long way so we have a lot left but I would purchase this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> Smells ok, but is NOT the right color. Greenish-gray and not attractive. I haven&#x27;t tried to make anything with it yet. crossing my fingers.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Great packaging. I mix it in with coconut oil. Very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Adovia is one of my favorite brand that I have been using for a quite months already. They never disappoint me with their great products.First let me tell you about the packaging! Holy Cow!It&#x27;s a huge jar!!I wonder if I can ever gonna finish this jar. As you can see, it comes with a [plastic jar- no fancy here.The butter has a very thick consistency. I have received the shade- Ivory. I don&#x27;t know why they mention about the shade, because it is transparent and it just a body butter that doesn&#x27;t involve with color!! lol. So this is how I use it-- Straightly dive my cleaned fingers into jar, scoop a little bit of this solid butter and rub it on my palm so that it melted into oil and then applied it on my body.  This is a pure shea body butter I have ever tried.I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any additional scents, rather than it has a weird smell which somehow irritates me. But when it absorbed on the skin, you don&#x27;t smell anything. I think its the perfect body butter for my dry skin, because it hydrates and keep my skin moisturized all day long. A little goes a long way.It makes my dry skin so soft and smooth. I  specially use it on my legs and over the stretch marks area; because those areas are most essential place to use a good body butter.Overall, I am fully satisfied (once again!) about this body butter.I highly recommend this to try out specially if you have dry skin like mine. I have received this for review.All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received this for free for review purposes. This stuff is great on eczema! I whip it up in my Kitchenaid stand mixer w/ some essential oils and put in a glass jar.</li>
    <li> My grandmother always wanted to have soft hands and as I age, I understand why.  This is by far one of the best hand and foot moisturizers on the market.  The container stays on my nightstand as it has become a bedtime ritual for me.  Thank you, for quickly shipping this product and allowing me to post a blog review.</li>
    <li> I love using organic quality shea butter on my skin &amp; in DIY recipes. It is becoming harder &amp; harder to trust that the shea butter we buy is not highly processed. I went on a search to find high quality, organic, raw shea butter. I was scent a tub of Adovia Pure Shea Butter and have been using it a few weeks now, and I believe I have found it!    Adovia Shea Butter feels great on my skin and there&#x27;s so many uses whether you&#x27;re using it straight out of the tub or concocting your own DIY recipe. This shea butter is quite a bit thicker than a lot of oil and creams but it heals and moisturizes instantly. It takes a couple minutes to absorb completely so if you&#x27;re in a rush you might want to wait until you have more time.    I also use my shea butter to tame my flyaways. In Southeast Texas we have like 100% humidity ALWAYS! So flyaways are almost impossible to tame, but this stuff helps SO much. I love rubbing some on my feet right after a bath, it really locks in the hydration to get smooth feet! Shea butter is also said to treat skin issues such as: Eczema, Psoriasis, Dermatitis, dry skin, rashes, hives and tons of other skin problems.  Other uses are:    Chapped lips and skin  Burns  Wounds  Shaving Cream  Hair Treatments  DIY muscle cream  DIY deodorant  DIY diaper rash cream  Other DIY recipes    If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and or leave a comment. I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews help those interested make an informed decision before purchasing. I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company.</li>
    <li> I used this shea butter to make homemade body butter and I&#x27;m loving the way it turned out. This tub comes in a container that you can reuse to store it. It looks like a solid brick, but you can use a spoon to shave off chunks fairly easy. It does have a oily texture, so it can be a bit messy if you work with it by hand. I added love spell essential oil and coconut oil, but you can use it on its own as well. I tried it as lip balm without adding anything and it works perfectly fine that way. A little goes a long way too. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again to make homemade Christmas gifts this year!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. She is saying a lot of good things about it and her skin is much softer now.</li>
    <li> Excellent, rich Shea butter. I use it to make gifts for people, using essential oils, and it works very nicely.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
    <li> Pure and arrived swiftly!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> review from my wife...&lt;br /&gt;Except the smell of the product I like the everything....comes in 450 gram jar...which is a lot for me....all natural and organic ingredient....after the first you skin does not feel the dry any more...stay in multiple wash I feel....I wish they could change the smell of the product...</li>
    <li> AMAZING product at a great price!!  Thank you Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice and Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Does not leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Shea butter!! I have added essential oils and made my own hand cream. Great quality!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t soften as quickly as coconut oil and is therefore harder to rub in on it&#x27;s own, but it keeps my skin feeling moist all day. I have very dry skin. I will try making a body butter with it to make it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Great pure shea butter for the price. Moisturizes and mixes well.</li>
    <li> This is really really good skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> OMG truly amazing Shea butter! Nice and thick, absorbs right into the skin and heals so well. I didn&#x27;t know that it comes hard but all you have to do is put a spoon in it and move the Shea around or spoon some right into your hands and rub it together.</li>
    <li> Wish I had found this years ago my hands are lovely and soft</li>
    <li> Seems to be what I expected</li>
    <li> Very creamy. Came in a container for easy storage and the company emailed me a link for 50 dyi recipes!</li>
    <li> Arrived packed nicely. Great quality shea butter.  Mixes well with carrier oils.</li>
    <li> Very nice Shea butter. I used it to make body butter. The smell is mild and natural. I will order this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter I have ever used. It is very smooth.</li>
    <li> Love using for my handmade Christmas gifts, such as a Lavander men&#x27;s shaving whip.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter, I blend this with coconut oil, olive oil, rose hip oil, and lavender oil for fragrance.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter has a fabulous nutty scent that is not overwhelming for me.  It is solid at room temperature and melts into a smooth consistency when you rub it into your palms.  Great for skin care and home made beauty products.  My only complaint is that the description said it comes with a recipe booklet, which I did not receive.  Not a huge deal, I&#x27;ll just search online for recipes, but it would have been a nice perk.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it. I&#x27;m 36 weeks pregnant and my stretch marks were purple they were so dark. As of today they&#x27;ve dramatically lightened up. I will recommend to any pregnant lady I know.</li>
    <li> Just used this fine product in a Shea butter recipe this evening. I&#x27;m giving it to my daughter&#x27;s for Mother&#x27;s Day. I will definitely be keeping up a relationship with this company in the future!</li>
    <li> This is the best Shea butter I have ever worked with, it blends creamy, and there is a huge difference in the products I make . love it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Very happy with my purchase! Used this to make lip balm and beard balm for my husband. Item was as described and soft.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best quality Shea butter I have ordered and tried. I am extremely pleased with the product and I will be ordering this product again</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing that&#x27;s all I can say</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  I am using it as a body moisturizer and also as a lip balm and facial moisturizer...it keeps my skin so soft all day long! Will never have to buy any  another lotion...finally found the perfect one!  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Shea Butter - Fresh on arrival and packed well. I applied this straight from the container. Nice and smooth and absorbed very well. No cons at all : )</li>
    <li> Nice texture, however it has an odor that can be masked with sufficient essential oils somewhat.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s soft and buttery and easy to work with. I use it for everything and make my own skin care products, for the whole family and this product is wonderful. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised and the best price I could find at the time!</li>
    <li> Arrived very fast. I highly recommend this product it is easy to work with and makes AMAZING butters</li>
    <li> I like the shea butter, but just wish that it had a different scent to it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s shea butter. I used it in a lotion I made not exactly an exciting purchase</li>
    <li> use for hair and body.</li>
    <li> Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in glass instead of plastic!</li>
    <li> I got this as one of the ingredients to make my own chapstick (highly recommended by the way), and this tub will be lasting a VERY long time! I&#x27;ll have to find other ways to use it!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but I did some research on Shea butter before I bought it seems authentic and I really like it by itself or I&#x27;ve made some awesome creams out of it!</li>
    <li> Great Shea Butter. Works great to relieve my itching with psoriasis. Was very pleased with order. Fast Shipping. Great Seller.</li>
    <li> The shea butter is very nice.  The packaging arrived cracked and unusable.  So I transferred the product to a plastic bag.</li>
    <li> The product arrived very quickly. Also, it&#x27;s a fair amount for the price. It has a bit of a smell, which isn&#x27;t a favorite. But the odor is light and goes away after awhile. And it seems to work, which is most important. Because of the smell, I wouldn&#x27;t use it all over my body. Targeted areas are best. Unless you have away to mask that. I really can&#x27;t say much. I&#x27;ve only used the product a couple of times. I can say, so far so good. I like it (minus the smell).</li>
    <li> I was hoping that this product would be more easily absorbed but it left my skin feeling greasy.  I was also looking forward to it being a smooth buttery texture, however, it was quite hard and therefore not too easy to scoop and apply.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use this to make some home made beauty products</li>
    <li> I liked this Shea butter. I felt as if it was a little on the greasy side. Which I didn&#x27;t expect, but besides that, I love the light scent. I&#x27;ve been using it during my pregnancy, very happy so far</li>
    <li> This shea is great! I won&#x27;t buy any other Product. Leaves my skin moisturized the entire day!</li>
    <li> I used this to make a sleepy time lotion for my family with my essential oils.  The product came as described and is wonderful!  Love this shea butter and this company. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It was very hard, had to dig it out of the container.  Once you got it out, you had to hold it for some time to soften. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> I researched quite a bit before buying. Last time I ordered several tubs of shea butter from a different company, and while it was a good deal, I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the actual product. It was too waxy and harder to work with for my purposes. I&#x27;m very pleased with Cleopatra&#x27;s after using it to make lotion bars and sunscreen bars. It is easy to scoop, melts wonderfully in a double boiler system, and then resolidifies perfectly. I will certainly use them again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and I love the product! Thanks! Will order again!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for selling a great product and providing an E book as well. You are honest in stating 1 LB, as some other vendors have been less than honest in this matter. I look forward to creating many body butters and lotions.</li>
    <li> I purchased two tubs. I love this stuff. We use as diaper cream, sun screen, hair moisturizer, natural bronzer, the list goes on. I love shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;However one of the tubs smelled like they burnt the butter. I ended up using it because I thought it might be too late to return. I would have given it a 5 star if it weren&#x27;t for that problem.</li>
    <li> Good quality shea butter that is perfect for use in chapsticks. No complaints!! It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> love this brand will buy again</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal! It is the thick raw version of shea butter and silky smooth to the touch. This is hard to find here in my local stores, so I am really glad I could get such a big tub of it here. I love using it to make our own soaps, the raw shea butter makes my skin sooo soft when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
    <li> Just received my shea butter and it had two big cracks on the container. Even though it wasn&#x27;t bad, it could&#x27;ve really been one messy delivery. Still can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
    <li> This product does what it is advertised to do.  However, my skin remains greasy for about 2-3 hours, even though using very little.  I do have some contact allergies but have no reaction to this, a big plus for me</li>
    <li> Great product Will order again</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! I use it straight as a facial cream before I apply my makeup. I also mix it with coconut oil and lavender essential oil to use as a lotion and melt it into my kid&#x27;s baths. The kids come out so soft and moisturizer which is tough to keep up with in the winter!!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from extremely dry skin this season, and I have tried so many different moisturizers, lotions and oils. Some have helped, but a lot of times I feel the need to re-apply every hour or so to keep my hands and skin from getting the next eczema attack!  This issue has been a problem for me every winter, but this season has been the worst because of the dry, cold climate where the temperatures get in the single digits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t wait until I tried the Ceopatra&#x27;s Choice Raw Shea Butter, and I am so glad I did.  I have tried moisturizing products that contain the Shea Butter, but I mostly purchased them because they have the Shea Butter ingredient.  The Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice is 100% pure Shea Butter with no additives at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this in the mail, the Shea Butter was hard rock solid because of the cold weather.  So if you live in a colder climate, make sure to leave it in room temperature so that it is workable and easier to apply.  I just grab a small spoon and take about a dime amount, and slowly and gently work it into a circular motion into my skin.  I noticed that if I rub it in a circular motion, the Shea Butter tends to absorb quicker into the skin.  This is not lightweight at all, so I apply a generous amount at night before bed so that my skin can really absorb all of the vitamins overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a major help for my eczema.  Not only do my hands and legs feel very moisturized when I wake up in the morning, but I also noticed that my hands and other areas of my skin stay fairly moisturized throughout the entire day!  This has been a huge help for my hands especially, since it is prone to have eczema constantly!  I am so happy that tried this product!  If you have dry skin like mine, this might be the best solution to your dry skin!  I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future!</li>
    <li> This shea butter smells better than some other brands I&#x27;ve used, but the texture is weird. It feels grainy-gritty, like sand in the container, and when I try to scoop a small amount out it crumbles and bits drop all over the counter. However, when I&#x27;m finally able to get a portion out, it does melt into my skin nicely and moisturizes well. There&#x27;s just too much waste trying to get some out though. Also, it&#x27;s listed a Prime eligible but took 4 business days to reach me.</li>
    <li> Love it. Really helps with the dryness.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. It made my stretch marks shrink and lighten up, and it even reduced some of the fine lines I have under my eyes. It provides excellent moisture for the skin. I love the way my skin looks and feels now. Its very rare to find a product that actually works and that you can see the results of over time as you use it. Thanks for the authentic, high quality product! I will be buying more as soon as I run out :)</li>
    <li> I received the Shea butter in a resealable container. It&#x27;s a great quality shea butter. I use it to make home made face cream and body cream.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. The shea butter works great for all my moisturizing needs and came quickly, packaged well.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> At first I had no idea what to do with this stuff, but I read some homemade skincare recipes online and ran kitchen experiments for a week. Now, I&#x27;ve made aftershave for my husband, body butter for me, face cream for friends, and even used it as is on my cuticles at night. I love that you can melt it and use it for so many skincare needs or leave it alone and use it as it comes (fairly solid). A little goes a long way, so this tub will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice sent me a free tub of pure shea butter to try and I do like it enough that I&#x27;d buy it myself when I run out. It&#x27;s definitely been valuable in our house.</li>
    <li> I made an amazing sugar body scrub with this. It had brown sugar, coconut oil, vanilla, olive oil, and Pure Shea Butter. It was so creamy and buttery. I made a batch where I didn&#x27;t mix it in completely so I can get the bits of shea to rub in. I have used it by itself and it is thick, but leave it in your hands or on your fingers for a few seconds and you can rub it in without problems. My daughter said it helped her with her mosquito bites too. YES! Excellent! I love that there are so many uses for it. I can&#x27;t wait to experiment more and try all the other multitude of uses. I was sent this for review but it does not influence my review.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the minimal packaging and the fact that it was packaged in a recyclable container! Afterall, when you are going for an organic, all-natural product, why negate your natural efforts with a lot of wasteful packing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was harder in texture than I anticipated, as I have never used pure shea butter before. It is firm, but it melts into your skin easily just from the contact with body heat, and has a very natural “nutty” scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people use pure shea butter as a base for DIY soaps, lotions, body butters, and scrubs by combining it with other ingredients and essential oils, but I wanted to experience it “as is”, so we dug right in and put it to the test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the 5 Ways Shea Butter Saved our Summer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Josh came home from Tennessee with an itchy, bumpy rash on his hands that he gets every time we go there. Maybe an allergy? Who knows, but it shows up every time and it usually lasts a few weeks! He slathered on the shea and it was soothed and clear in just a few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I walk 3-4 miles every day, and in the hot, sunny days of summer my lips get very dry. By applying the shea on as a protective lip balm, they stayed soft, smooth and protected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Our dog had some spots of very dry, irritated skin that he couldn’t stop scratching. I put the shea in my hands, rubbed them together to get it melted, and then rubbed it on his skin. It seemed to really help heal his skin! (Just be careful that your dog doesn’t lick too much of this directly as it is a nut product. I did a google search before applying and read a few articles for a bit more info to ensure safety.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Maiya came home after six weeks in California and the skin around her mouth and nose were dry and flaky. She can not stand lotion, but I persuaded her to apply the shea on her face, and within a few days she was back to healthy skin! It won her over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. We all know that sandal season means dry, cracked heels. I kept the tub of shea butter on the table beside our couch, and each night while watching tv rubbed a little into my feet. Proud to say I look like I’ve been treated to a regular pedi without the expense of going to the salon!al season means dry, cracked heels.

    <li> Absolutely love this product, the possibilities are endless!!  I am using it as a body moisturizer right when I get out of the shower or bath. I also use it on my face before I go to bed.  My skin feels soft and hydrated! !</li>
    <li> Can neat and not damaged.... I made a whipped Shea butter, mixed with olive, tea tree,vitamin  E, Argan, coconut oil and tsp of honey. Smell is nice even without the oils. It was pretty hard to get out the jar to mix but I just melted it a little and whipped this baby right up. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love it. Although It is hard to get out, it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> received with no damage, going to be using this very soon</li>
    <li> Works great for my dry skin. I use after each shower, really does the job of keeping skin hydrated and smooth. Very good for my dry knees and elbows. A little more work than just squeezing something out of a bottle but well worth the effort. I just break off some from the tub and work with my hands till its dissolves, then apply.</li>
    <li> Overall I was very pleased with my purchase. The Shea butter is great to use for making body butters and while it came as a solid block it melts nicely.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 2yr old&#x27;s chapped cheek due to dry weather/possible eczema. Add long as I put a teeny bit on 2-3x a day, she doesn&#x27;t get red and crusty. It&#x27;s pretty stiff, so you have to take a bit and work in your fingers before it&#x27;s spreadable,  but I think that&#x27;s why it works. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that I don&#x27;t like the smell. It isn&#x27;t a horrible smell, but some of the reviews said it smelled really nice, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> When I received the Shea Butter the container was badly cracked on both sides. The texture of the Shea Butter was smooth but unlike other Shea butters that I&#x27;ve purchased it didn&#x27;t melt in my hands when rubbed it together. It had more of a playdoh texture and it kept rolling up on itself when I tried to rub it in the palm of my hands. After all the reviews I read I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is great product. Love it.</li>
    <li> best product I have  ever bought!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer and carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it all already! Great quality and blended nicely into massage butters and solid perfumes. Thank you!  (fast shipping and good packaging as well)</li>
    <li> Easier to dispense and measure out because of the container.  Other brands place their products in bags, it is hard to get all the product out of that bag.  The shea butter has a great texture and works very well in making a body butter.</li>
    <li> excellent moisturizer for my eczema . hands are well moisturized all day with one application and even after  frequent hand washing.  no offensive odor. a</li>
    <li> I love this!! Perfect for making body butter!</li>
    <li> Love this, makes my hands so soft!</li>
    <li> This is the best Organic Shea Butter in the world. I have purchased this for several years and I am very satisfied. I use it on any dry skin and especially my feet! I can not be without!  Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice delivers the best products. I can always depend on them to ship and receive any of their product in a timely matter. What is better is that they deliver to your door!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is a great product, It is very economical , I have been using it for about 3 years</li>
    <li> Very very good! The smell is NOT overpowering like other brands of Shea butter! I like the ivory color as well!</li>
    <li> Pure Shea Butter is something I always sought after while pregnant or soon after pregnancy to reduce or get rid of stretch marks. It was like the magic cream. I would also use it on my elbows, knees and feet, because it softens the skin. My husband jokes that I scrape him with my elbows, so I&#x27;m so glad Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Brand Pure Shea Butter is the real deal! It smells like Shea butter should (you know? kind of like candle wax) and made my elbows feel really soft again, from the first use. What&#x27;s even better is the price for what you get. The container is large enough to last a really long time and I had the results I expected. Soft skin with no dry areas. After wearing heels daily, it&#x27;s good to treat the rough, dry areas of my feet. I&#x27;m happy to have it again and plan to mix a little of it with a bit of coconut oil before going out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I get the same results I used to when it comes to stretch marks. Of course I will continue using this and If the stretch marks decrease, I will update this review!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is great for so many reasons! PURE shea butter is the very best because everything is safe and natural for your skin and body. There are many amazing beauty recipes that shea butter can be used it. I added some of my Essential Oils to mine to give it a better smell. I basically use it as a body butter. It leaves my skin feeling beautiful and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about pure shea butter is that it has so many uses! Adovia’s shea butter is 100% Natural and Organic Pure Shea Butter, Made with Hand Selected Finest Nuts of the Shea Tree in Ghana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the many other uses for this great shea butter:&lt;br /&gt;• Daily Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;• DIY Soap&lt;br /&gt;• DIY Skin Care&lt;br /&gt;• DIY Lotion&lt;br /&gt;• Stretch Mark&lt;br /&gt;• Dry skin and many skin diseases&lt;br /&gt;• Damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why choose THIS shea butter above others? Adovia is a great company with high quality products! I have used about 5-6 different products from them and they are all superb! This product is also a really great price. I definitely recommend this shea butter to any DIY/Crafty person or anyone looking for a pure and healthy product for their skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free as a part of a review program, however that does not determine my opinion of this product. I only give my 100% honest opinion and I have NOT been paid for my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoyed this review and it helped with your purchasing decision, please mark the review as HELPFUL.</li>
    <li> Shea Butter has gained its popularity over the years especially with pregnant women because it helps to reduce the appearance of stretch marks during and after pregnancy. It was my choice while I was pregnant with both my kids but to be honest it didn&#x27;t do much. I soon found out that it was most effective in its purest form (100%). I was using products that mixed shea butter with lots of other chemicals, so therefore it was not as efficient.&lt;br /&gt; I have a few stretch marks from my last pregnancy and thought they would &amp;#34;magically&amp;#34; disappear the same way they did in my first pregnancy. So I wanted to see if using shea butter in its purest form would make a difference. I have been using it twice a day and ensuring that I massage it into the skin in a circular motion. I honestly did not expect a difference because I am using this and expecting a change a year and a half after having my baby girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stretch marks have since started fading slowly and the skin appearance on my tummy appears less stretched out. I have since started rubbing my feet and hands at night to improve skins look in the morning. I apply more to problem areas such as the heel and ball of my feet. This shea butter is an instant moisturizer and it is long lasting. For the price on Amazon (around $12) the 1 lb tub is worth every penny and more. Being that it is in its hardened form, creating natural heat by rubbing it between the palms of your hands will melt it easily for application. It will smooth on a tad bit greasy but it is absorbed quickly into the skin within the minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next task is to melt it to oil form and add it to my oil mixture for my hair. If anyone has tried I would love to know what they have found. I love it for my skin and will continue using it and expecting it to be a game changer for my skin during awful winter.</li>
    <li> I had heard that the Shea butter works well and it is natural.  I figured I would try it and see the results.  It does a very good job for keeping the skin smooth and well hydrated.  I would most certainly order it again as I feel it is giving me results with out the chemicals.  Nothing better than nature.</li>
    <li> Great quality shea butter. I prefer to use this product as an ingredient in DIY body butters and such. I feel that this product is best used with other oils. Since this product is fragrance free, I would also recommend using an essential oil to scent the shea butter since in it&#x27;s natural form it has a distinct earthy smell. I mainly use the shea butter for eczema issues and for that it&#x27;s works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Shea butter was of ivory color, it came in a well packaged tumbler. When I opened it, it was bit solidified. It was not like facial moisturizing creams , but was like frozen butter. I took some butter in a bowl and mixed some tea tree oil in it and then whipped it a bit. I normally apply it on my body as a moisturizer. Only a little amount is sufficient for one time usage, it becomes soft once you start rubbing it. Normally people complain about Shea butter&#x27;s woody smell but I couldn&#x27;t sense any smell. It didn&#x27;t smell at all. I normally apply it before going to bed, it keeps my skin soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I read that it helps in eliminating stretch marks and wrinkles. I couldn&#x27;t test that as I have none of them. I also noticed that it keeps legs smooth if you massage it before shaving your legs. But you need to be careful as it can make your bathtub slippery ( sharing from personal experience ).&lt;br /&gt;In short, I can say that this product works very well as a moisturizing agent. It is now a new addition to my bath time routine.You can get Spa experience at home by lightening some candles and getting massage using Shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestions-&lt;br /&gt; 1) I would love more if this butter has some added fragrance . I couldn&#x27;t feel any smell.&lt;br /&gt; 2) This product should be launched in small packages as well say 50 gm or 100 gm, that will make this product more reasonable and larger audience would be able to sample it.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for review purpose for sharing my honest opinion.Opinions expressed are 100% of my own and not influenced by anyone.</li>
    <li> I honestly love natural products as I have told you all repeatedly, and there&#x27;s nothing quite like 100% pure and organic raw shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Adovia has done it again, and successfully made me fall in love with yet another amazing natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of unrefined, raw shea butter are many:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Made with the finest nuts of the shea tree in Ghana&lt;br /&gt;  Natural relief from dry skin&lt;br /&gt;  Eczema relief&lt;br /&gt;  Acne blemish improvement&lt;br /&gt;  Psoriasis relief&lt;br /&gt;  Diminished Stretch Marks&lt;br /&gt;  Contains Vitamin A-Vitamin E-Vitamin F&lt;br /&gt;  Non pore clogging&lt;br /&gt;  Highly Moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;  Fantastic for Hair &amp; Skin health &amp; beauty&lt;br /&gt;  Gorgeous ivory color of product&lt;br /&gt;I used this exceptional product mostly as a skin moisturizer. My husband loved to use it after shaving and to moisturize dry skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter had such an enjoyable scent that was very slight but pleasing. A little bit in your hand melts into your skin like butter and moisturizes all day long. I love this product and will continue to use it daily as a go to skin and hair moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can enjoy this exceptional product for yourself, which includes a 100%  Money back satisfaction guarantee!</li>
    <li> I received this as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For testing it was a bit much to receive a pound, the quantity cold have been smaller for a sampling. It does hold the moisture in your skin 10 fold.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best I have used hands down!! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> There are a ton of choices when buying Shea butter and I was worried about which one to pick, but I am happy with my decision to buy this one. It comes in a container instead of a bag so I won&#x27;t have to worry about it going bad or getting hard. I got the ivory one and it&#x27;s just like I expected it to be. It truly is high quality unrefined Shea butter. If I ever need more in the future (1 lb will last me a while) then I will buy from here again.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is one of the best. It takes a minute to warm up in my hand, but once it does I massage it into my face. I also use it for any other dry patches on my skin, partically where I have eczema. Thank you for such a great product. It&#x27;s going to last a very long time</li>
    <li> Very rich, very creamy Shea butter. Product arrived in perfect condition. Use in soap making and body cream.</li>
    <li> I could not even use this because of it being so hard in the container.  It was impossible to get it out of the container with my fingers. They kindly refunded my money though.</li>
    <li> This is a great Shea butter for making personal body care products from. I&#x27;ve used it for a whipped body butter and a magnesium body butter and have loved both. It&#x27;s been wonderful for my normally dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is VERY moisturizing to your skin. I love the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell of shea butter.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet to create anything but I&#x27;m sure it will only enhance any of my recipes because of the quality.</li>
    <li> Nothing keeps my feet, hands and hair soft but Cleopatras butter.</li>
    <li> Like the Shea butter, but did not receive the 50-page book that was supposed to come with it.  Was hoping the book would tell me the many uses for it,</li>
    <li> Prefect for making lotion and chapstick or on its own</li>
    <li> I used it in some chap stick and it melted well.  It comes in a nice tub.  It comes out kind of like coconut oil, chunky and hard.  I found nothing wrong with the product. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of shea butter for years now and love it.  I am beginning to create a line of organic products for face and body care and am always confident that the end result will be excellent whether it is used alone or in a mixture.  Every order has been perfect in product and time to arrive!  I hope they never quit selling this because I plan on using shea butter for my entire life:)</li>
    <li> Excellent product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Shea butter to help my surgery incision and it seemed to be working great!  Will look for other uses as well.</li>
    <li> Love this product, mixed with oils and made my own beauty products.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! :-) Love it!</li>
    <li> I like the fact this product is organic. The texture is smoother than your typical off-the-shelf shea butter, which is nice. I mix mine with a whole bunch of other ingredients, the combination held up well. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Love love love! 1000% happy with this Shea butter. Great quality, smell and texture. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> this is so nice on your skin it melts in and stays soft all day long and a little bit goes a long way! Very happy with this purchase and will buy it again !</li>
    <li> Heavy texture initially...blends nicely!</li>
    <li> this stuff is a luxury</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 years now, and my skin is very soft no more roughness.  This Shea Butter is the BEST!!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is very moisturizing and has a gentle and light fragrance. My skin feels very soft and supple. Shea butters used in the past would have a greasy feel to my skin and by morning my skin would be dry.  This Shea butter is different! My skin feels great! I highly recommend it and definitely will be buying again. Thanks Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice for an excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter, I will order again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Organic  Shea Butter.  It is very moisturizing - I have used it on cracked heels and it has healed them up.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is absolute wonderful.  The texture compared to other products can&#x27;t be matched.  When I first tried shea butter, I was a skeptic.  The seller said that it was a natural bug repellant ...... of course I did not believe this!  Mosquitoes absolutely love me so I never stay outside for any length of time.  Since using shea butter daily, I have not had one mosquito bites and it keeps my skin moist.  It was a winner hands down.  I also like the smell which smells like chocolate.  It can be a little oily if too much is used so applying in moderation before stepping out of the shower works best for me.  I would highly recommend this product.  Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of shea Butter, the product has a distinct smell that takes a little getting used too.  After a few minuets it warms in your hands from body heat to be able to spread.  Use daily for overall moisturizing and also to LOC natural hair with other natural oils.  Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Best all around skin product because it&#x27;s unrefined and natural.</li>
    <li> This is some great Shea butter. Was having some skin irritation cleared it right up.</li>
    <li> I received a 50% off / free shipping coupon code in my email for this product so I decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t get free shipping but I did get 50% off the price. I am very happy that I purchased this shea butter because it is very high quality butter. It is a very clean and creamy butter with a light nutty scent and it worked perfectly in the homemade body butter that I made. I am very pleased with my purchase and I would highly recommend this butter to everyone. It has really exceeded my expectations and I definitely will be purchasing more (in a larger quantity) of this wonderful creamy shea butter.</li>
    <li> Great, high quality product I use for making my own lotions. Great customer service . Great choice. Prompt shipping. Will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter comes in a plastic container with 1 pound of the butter.  This has a white/ivory color and is a solid block (think of frozen cooking butter).  This has a unique smell to it that I can&#x27;t quite identify that I am not crazy about but luckily it isn&#x27;t that strong.  This is my first time at trying this and I am less familiar with all the various uses this has.  I initially tried this with nothing added on my skin and this applies and feels a little more oily/greasy and stays on the skin a bit more and doesn&#x27;t absorb as easily into my skin as other types of moisturizing creams.  This does moisturize the skin very well though and would be good especially if you suffer from really dry skin or skin related issues.  It gives the skin a \\&quot;shiny moist\\&quot; smoother, softer look but again it stayed on the top of my skin, still feeling a bit oily for some time after applying.  This didn&#x27;t bother or irritate my sensitive skin though, which is good.  After doing so online research, I also tried mixing with other ingredients to make it easier for applying as this is a pretty hard butter and adding oils can help with the smell which I don&#x27;t like.  Although it can be used on its own, I think adding some oils make it even better.  I will update my review over longer term use if I have any new observations on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> A little crumbly but definitely works</li>
    <li> I ordered this tub of organic sea butter to help moisturize my horribly dry cracked winter skin.  Shea butter is solid at room temperature and has a natural nutty scent to it.  It can be gently heated to soften for easy application.  This is a wonderful product for dry chapped skin.  I have been putting it on my lips and they are so soft.  Shea butter works better on my lips than any lip balm I have tried and doesn&#x27;t leave my lips burning even when they are cracked.  My son plays trumpet and his lips are in very bad shape this winter.  I have been using shea butter on them for the past 2 days and they are healing up very nicely. Shea butter is so versatile I am using it to moisturize my entire body.  This book also comes with a very handy eBook with a bunch of recipes for homemade skin care products.  I can&#x27;t wait to start experimenting with this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first Shea Butter purchase, and I am thrilled with the product!  It made a great whipped body lotion with a great texture.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my hands and feet feel. It honestly is so soft. My husband likes it too. He likes that it smells more natural and not like flowers like most lotions. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter! Some may say the price is steep, but it&#x27;s so versatile, and I find it a great investment. It&#x27;s great for all over the body, and hair. Not to mention, I can use this as a lip balm when I&#x27;m missing any of my lip products. I have very dry and sensitive. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I have no need in any other moisturizer!  My skin has significantly improved. My nails are stronger, my cuticles look great, and my face is clear healthy looking. No more dry patches anywhere. My skin noticeably smoother and feels amazing. The Shea Butter is really great after shaving. I also put this in my hair a day before I&#x27;m supposed to wash it and it leaves my hair very shiny and soft. Well worth the cost, in my opinion. You cannot go wrong with this fantastic product!</li>
    <li> After receiving this product and recipes and am looking forward to creating some natural products. First thing I notices was the color and the light scent. I am pleased with the odor of this Shea butter, as it is much more appealing than others I have experienced in the past. I look forward to creating body butters, lip balm and hair products. Thanks again</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and my husband deal with eczema constantly, are always itching, so we are always looking for new cream/lotions to try out. So when I was given this to try out I was ecstatic! Comes in a huge resealable container, which Im sure will last us a long time, and a little bit goes a long way! As soon as my husband put in on his fingers, where he suffers most from eczema, he said how much he loved how it made his hands feel! Too soon to tell the effects with my daughters skin, but her flareups seem to be calming down a bit, so im very hopeful! Im also excited to try out the butter on my constantly dry skin, and now that ive heard all of the other uses im excited to try them as well!</li>
    <li> All I can say about this product is that, I absolutely love it and will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> Very strong unpleasant odor</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry and sensitive skin throughout the year, especially during winter months. I love to use organic products, so when I found that I could purchase this Organic Shea Butter at such a great low price. I was very excited &amp; purchased it right away. I usually apply the shea butter after getting out of the shower, helps to moisturize. It&#x27;s nice, when I get up in the morning my skin is very soft. I&#x27;m noticing quite a difference on my feet &amp; hands, which tend to be where my skin seems the driest. Shea Butter works very well and has a great quality to it. I highly recommend this product for anyone, to add to their daily skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see how big the tub of shea butter I got to try for free was but wasn&#x27;t complaining. Ive never tried pure shea butter and have to  admit it was not only surprising but very unexpected! ive had many body washes that say &amp;#34;made with shea butter&amp;#34; and have loved the scents but not the results of the actual product. The pure organic shea butter has a very unusual smell that im not use to but my skin has made an amazing transformation in just a few short days! Not only is my sons eczema under control but my skin is all rough and bumpy! Honestly I was hoping for a sweet smell but ill gladly take the results of a nice smell any day!!!</li>
    <li> good product easy absorb</li>
    <li> Great! I&#x27;m a huge fan of shea butter and this one works great!!</li>
    <li> Gave to a Friend who has Rough Hands from working In the Yard. She sees a Big Improvement.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and love it. Really sooths chapped dry skin, (especially feet) in this cold dry Pennsylvania weather.</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter! It is great quality and has helped my dry skin :)</li>
    <li> organic Shea butter is pretty raw kind of body butter.the cleopatras choice has made a very original rather organic shea butter of high quality.i ordered after I tried using other commercial lotions and body butter.i have stretch marks pretty prominent on my waist area.and sometimes when it&#x27;s visible I feel bad and I dislike it and use to wonder what&#x27;s a pure solution with what I don&#x27;t have to worry .but after I recieved this butter I have tried couple of times only it seems to have no artificial commercial kind of ingredients seems like a homemade organic butter.hopefully will take away my stretch marks and also keeps my heels moist.pretty good quantity will last long.</li>
    <li> Working with paper all day long really drys out my hands...this works magic on them and makes them soft again.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great. Very soft. Whipped up my hair butter using this shea butter and I did it with a spoon!</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and gave my body a body facial with it. since it&#x27;s winter the skin is so dry. After I used it it felt as if I just soaked in the tub with baby oil. So smooth . Great stuff for dry skin or if you just want to pamper yourself.</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter I have ever bought!!! I typically find butter that is very hard to spread. Even though this one, in the container, appears to be very solid, it spreads very easily and provides all day coverage. So glad I found this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff ,It&#x27;s high quality I will use it for everything it&#x27;s so refreshing and clean ,I would recommend it to everyone for everything.</li>
    <li> I used this product to make my own whipped body butter. I&#x27;m pregnant and have gone through a ton of store bought body butters trying to keep my belly well moisturized. I decided to try to make my own and am very pleased! I followed one of the recipes they provided in their ebook. I mixed this product with coconut oil, olive oil and vitamin e oil and whipped in my kitchen aid mixer and it turned out great! Now I have a huge supply of my own body butter that smells and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have an extremely dry skin, especially during spring IDK why, but i get these dark spots on my chest and back. I was going to make my own body butter with this but i decided to just use it like it is, this thing is fantastic. 3 days into using it, i can already tell that its getting better. I apply this butter 2-3x a day. I do not like the smell but i don&#x27;t hate it neither. It serves its purpose and I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Made body butter and diaper cream w this!  Love it!  Great quality and service!</li>
    <li> love it! it is so amazing! my face feels great after using it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! As a woman with thick, curly hair this was just what I needed. I melted this down and added a little extra virgin olive oil to it....perfection!!!!! Best moisturizer/detangler I have ever used!!!!!</li>
    <li> Seriously amazing. Made my ashy elbows feel soft</li>
    <li> I ordered two and they both arrived cracked and leaking. Part I could salvage was a good quality.</li>
    <li> Wow I honestly didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d love this as much as I do! I was so pleasantly surprised by the large size tub. I felt I could really use this consistently and not fear of using too much of a great thing. I&#x27;ve used this on my face, hands, cuticles, even a couple insect bites with wonderful results.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t greasy! It goes on so buttery smooth and just seeps into your skin and leaves it feeling more moisturized than any other product I have used. Sure this has a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell that isn&#x27;t exactly amazing but the results you get from the product make it more than tolerable and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger. I would rather this have the smell that it does then have a product with artificial scent additives.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone, combo skin and was looking for a good moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t cause me more problems and this is wonderful. I use it every night after cleansing my face and it leaves my face feeling so nice. I even got complimented on my complexion while wearing only this and no makeup!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simply amazing on dry hands and cuticles. Even in the summer my hands and cuticles are constantly dry and my fingers are always splitting. I put this on before bed and by morning my hands are still so soft!&lt;br /&gt;I recently got a couple bug bites that were annoyingly itchy. I read that shea butter is good for putting on insect bites so I tried it and a while later I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about the itch anymore.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many uses for this product I don&#x27;t even want to run out! I will be purchasing again! If you haven&#x27;t tried a good quality shea butter you must try this!</li>
    <li> This is truly a wonderful smooth and soothing butter.  I use it in my pain cream and body butter mixture.</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of Shea butters before, but this Organic Shea Butter is in a league of it&#x27;s own! I was offered this product from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice for a great deal to try and share my honest thoughts and opinion about it. It came and I opened the container expecting to see a creamy substance because most shea butters are lotion like. Well this Organic Shea Butter is hard like a block of cheese but smooth to the touch. It easily spreadable and does not require a lot of product. Even using this product every day I can see it lasting for a few years! I&#x27;ve been using it on my driest spots like my elbows and knees for about a week now and I can&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft they are! The your looking for a great Organic Shea Butter that will last a long time and work great, get this one from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice!</li>
    <li> First time I have ordered Shea Butter and this one is very good, does not have any fragrance that some have complained of some brands having. I would order this item again</li>
    <li> Raw Organic African Shea Butter by Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice is a great product for multi-uses for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a 1 pound plastic tub cold pressed.  It is very easy to scrap out and starts melting immediately when it touches your skin.  After rubbing it into your skin, it absorbs and moisturizes immediately with no greasy feeling.  There is a nutty aroma to the shea butter but it is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The many uses of this can cut down on keeping so many skin products around.&lt;br /&gt;Uses that I&#x27;ve been using it for is dry skin on my hands and feet, sun/wind burn, cuts, scraps, lip balm and bug bites.  Also the dark spots on my cheek and some scars left over from operations.  I received this at a promotional rate to review and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this organic shea butter and will continue to use it for it&#x27;s many benefits.</li>
    <li> When I recieved this product my kids were right there waiting to get into it, we all have extremely dry skin followed by a dose of eczema. After we all tried it we seemed to have similar opinions. First the product seemed to be well worth the money, that was impressive. It seemed after using the butter the skin felt soothed. We love that it is raw and unrefined being we all have skin allergies.  There are so many things you can do with this from adding essential oils, to making a mask for your hair, you can also use it in many other hair care products.You could do lotions and soaps too! It seems to be a all over healing product. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> So smooth and silky, yet solid and pure. I am absolutely elated to have recieved this. I have already made a batch of lip balm and lotion, as well as moisturizing deodorant. I am going to be blending it into a topical lotion for my friend, so she can heal any stretch marks her pregnancy caused. This comes from such a wonderful cause, and is an amazing, pure quality, I will never buy from another. The price is worth it, without a question.</li>
    <li> Awesome! My skin is so soft</li>
    <li> I comes in a very big tub so i can say that it will last you a very long time, it is a ivory color and says on the top that it is not yellow it is ivory. It does not have a very pleasant smell too it, so this would not be my go to product for moisturizer i would still use my others but on days that i have really dry skin i would use it. The fact of it not smelling very good is why i  wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time. Its also feels very oily when you apply it but the oiliness goes away pretty fast after you apply it.. So if u have dry skin and want something that is going to last you awhile i would buy this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have used it on my legs and arms for dry skin. I use it on my lips as a balm. I have also used it on my hair as a moisturizer. Luckily it is a big tub as I am using it often and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great at moisturing. It does leave a greasy feeling for a while, but eventually does go away. BUT if it has an odor to it. So yes it&#x27;s moisturing BUT it has an unpleasant smell</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is great. I use it for a lot of things I mostly use it on my skin to help my dry skin.</li>
    <li> As I understand, not all shea butter is created equal. Some comes out white, some yellow, some green. Mine is green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep in mind this is shea butter, NOT cocoa butter. It is not going to smell like a Hershey bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love what I received. This product is exactly as stated.</li>
    <li> The product seems like a good quality Shea butter. The smell is very plain, but not bad. The texture is thick and you have it scrape it out, but, once you get a bit in your hand, it rubs on pretty easily. I instantly felt the smoothing and comfort I look for in a quality shea butter. The only con I would say is that I wish it came in a roll-on format, as, that it is easier to apply, however, that would not keep me from purchasing again. I was really impressed with the quantity. The container is fairly large. This should last a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality product. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really compare this particular shea butter to alot of others, but it stands up to the one, I have been using.  I like that it comes in the tub, which makes it easy for storage.  I&#x27;m using it on my feet, with socks, at night.  It does a great job.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works perfectly.  It leaves your skin nice and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I received an excellent grade of shea butter.  I&#x27;ve purchased from different sellers.  The last purchase I made from a DIFFERENT seller was a gritty mix.  This one goes on smoothly.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Excellent product love it !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this type of product before so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like it or not. I melted it, and added argan and coconut oil to a small amount. I put it in my hair, it&#x27;s made my hair softer, and shiny. I also have dry irritated skin and I melt some and apply it directly to my skin, no irritation, ichyness etc. I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic and all natural. I&#x27;ve read that this product can help in alot of different ways. I can&#x27;t wait to look up what other ways I can use it for.</li>
    <li> Excellent fast delivery and quality!</li>
    <li> sooook scrumptious, my hair and drink it up!!!</li>
    <li> Daughter used it. Said hard to apply. And get absorbed.</li>
    <li> Works well; thank you.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is fantastic!! I will definitely be purchasing once I run out. It comes in a huge container, about the size of a bowl! You scoop a little out, melt it in your hands, and moisturize anywhere you need it! It has a light smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave hands greasy. I love it! great product.</li>
    <li> Love this shea butter it is great for rashes and eczema and easy to use as I make it into a whipped body lotion</li>
    <li> Really smells awful and is extremely hard to extract.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for Chapstick religiously and I love it.  Melts into your skin and does not leave a lasting residue.  I also melt the Shea butter I to my hands and use it all over my body, and combine with lotion for easy spreading.  Has made my skin softer and I love it!  I use it on my kiddos too without worry of chemicals in it.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> Great Product and great price.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use shape better along with cocoa butter and some oils to create homemade body butter. It&#x27;s all natural and very easy to do, and feels luxurious on the skin. Good for eczema as well, since there are no chemical additives.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, works great on moisturizing my extremely dry hair and skin!</li>
    <li> I use this shea butter to make a body lotion.  It is very easy to work with and feels fantastic on the skin.  My family and I have very dry, flaky skin during the winter and slather on loads of petroleum jelly and lotions.  I started using this shea butter to make my own lotion, and this is the first winter that I didn&#x27;t have any flaky skin.  I recommend this product to my friends who are thinking about making their own skin care products, and will continue to use it in my recipes.</li>
    <li> I never knew I could make my own natural products! I am so happy, the recipes are great. Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> The World Best Hot item.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Very welcoming and appreciative of my business! I will be back!</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter on the market my skin is beautiful, I have oily sensitive acne prone skin and this sheabutter is a gift from above,  I will never order from any other seller and believe me I have wasted money ordering from bad sellers, my husband loves it he is a big guy with a lot of dry patches and I had to buy another for him, he constantly ask me to feel his skin, lol..... I bought 2  orders in 2wks because I didn&#x27;t want to run out it has saved my funny acting skin. I didn&#x27;t know what real sheabutter was until I used this it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> This shea butter is very creamy and soft. I put a tiny bit on my hands, rub it together rapidly to warm it up and spread it around. Then I put a sock over my hands and sleep with it. The next morning, my hands are really soft. The only thing I should mention is that shea butter does not absorb very well, it really just sits on the skin as a barrier and keep the moisture in and allow your skin to heal itself. It also doesn&#x27;t wash off easily which is great because I wash my hands constantly due to my profession. So I put it on clean hands, rub it in and then go about my business and it takes the brunt of all that drying hand soap I use. Great natural product for preventing dryness, as long as you know its not a lotion that will be absorbed.</li>
    <li> Makes for very soft skin. Really helps with the dryness. Love it</li>
    <li> I received the item a few days ago. I have to say it was not what i expected. I have not used she butter before and I was looking forward to getting the product. Unfortunately I was not happy that the product was not sealed when it came. It was in a container like from a Chinese restaurant. When I opened it to use it had a very strong unpleasant odor. I think I will just pass it along to someone who needs it.</li>
    <li> It just take a little it goes a long way. Love and using it on my feet. leaves them so soft. This will last a really long time too much larger amount then I thought. I did a discount for a review.  No more dry skin in this house.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is exactly what I needed for my dry winter skin. It is very thick and easy to spead. It soaks in nicely without any greasy residue. Its a huge tub for the price. I plan on trying a few homemade lotion recipes I found on Pinterest. I really enjoy making my own body creams because I know exactly what is in them. This butter is so nice I can put it directly on my face and immediately felt results.  No breakouts because it is all natural. I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of over priced skin care that also has a ton of chemicals that you can&#x27;t even pronounce.</li>
    <li> Great stuff works pretty good...</li>
    <li> This shea butter is amazon. The winter has taken its toll on my skin. Especially my hands and this stuff has healed them in just a couple applications.</li>
    <li> Very great shea butter feels nice very big container well worth the money</li>
    <li> Im a huge fan of using coconut oil as a moisturizer post shower, I bought this Shea butter a few weeks ago to try instead of my usual coconut oil and it works great. It works just as well as the coconut oil as a moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t really like the smell it had but it was not so strong that i wouldn&#x27;t use the product. I am oping that the Shea will help camouflage my stretch marks better than the coconut oil did.</li>
    <li> I love using this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It was exactly as described and perfect for using to make my own cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Great natural soap with great cleaning properties!</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect consistency for my homemade bug balm. Melts like a dream and mixes well with other oils. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This Shea butter seems to be very high quality. So far I&#x27;m really impressed. I would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> You get a lot and it stays on well, it is very hard and crumbly. I work it with my fingers over a sink to try to get it smooth before applying as it makes a mess.  Smells almost like bacon cooking on a grill.  Not a pleasant smell for a &#x27;lotion&#x27;. I bought it for scars from a recent surgery and will continue to use it. Update: after using again it occurred to me that the smell is more like s campfire. Not pleasant. I whipped with some coconut oil as I saw in another review. Helped soften but it&#x27;s still has hard chunks. Also added a scented oil which helped very little. Wish this product was better.</li>
    <li> This butter is fragrance free and in a small plastic tub, much like a cottage cheese container. I used it on my face several times but had trouble spreading it sure to the dense consistency. Possibly you need to shave off some before use.</li>
    <li> Love the texture, and the smell is lovely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used Shea Butter before but wanted to try it for a cream for my dry skin. I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to but I really like this! Works great for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of my skin after I apply this. I like the subtle scent of natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> Really great product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this Shea butter! It is a great moisturizer. Works better than Shea butter bought from the drugstore. Would purchase more when I finished with this large sized container.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle cure for eczema!  I had a patch on my leg for over a year and this is the only thing that cleared it up.  I will definitely be getting it again.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. I have very dry skin all of a sudden after the birth of my son. I used this and it&#x27;s so much better. I can&#x27;t wait to see what continual use does. Thanks do very much.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have very dry skin and this feels wonderful on my skin.  You can use it straight out of the tub or make up your own natural butters cream using jojoba and cocoa butter along with the shea.  Either way it&#x27;s fabulous.  Sure, it has a slight smell,  but it goes away quickly after absorbing into your skin.  Why use body creams that have so many other toxic ingredients.  I&#x27;m very careful and particular about what I use on my skin.</li>
    <li> Best shea butter I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Great quality!!! Top notch product!!</li>
    <li> I like how it helped with my dry skin but I hated the smell and the texture! It was more like breaking wax. I had to use my fingernails to get it out and then rub it firmly to apply it. The smell is not very intriguing either. I probably will not purchase this again because I am sure I could find another product to help with my dry skin that had a better smell and texture to it.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is the bomb (in a very good way)! I use it on my hands,legs and elbows every morning and it leaves my skin so hydrated and radiant looking. It&#x27;s non greasy and absorbs very easy and quickly. A little goes a very long way,too!</li>
    <li> The product arrived with broken packaging. The product doesn&#x27;t come off of it though and it&#x27;s still good. I read from other reviews that the product is very hard. But if I put a small amount in my palms and rub it, it softens and gets spreadable. I like how it moisturizes my skin even the very dry spots. I am also using it to get rid of stretch marks. It hasn&#x27;t worked yet but I will update if it helps my stretch marks.4 stars because of the broken container otherwise I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter has worked really well on my sensitive and problematic skin. I use it all over me - even my face, and it has worked wonders as far as the dryness of my skin goes! It is the only product that has ever worked on the bleeding eczema that pops up every now and then on my fingers and it&#x27;s probably one of the few products that I can use all year round! I absolutely love its skin healing properties!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes.

    <li> I am in LOVE with this Shea Butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I had it, I did my usual soak, and exfoliate routine...only this time when I moisturized, I used this shea butter and put on a thick pair of socks. The next morning, I could not believe how soft my feet were. I still have a little bit of work to do on them, but the cracks in my heals are not as bad as they were, my feet are softer, and even my toenails are stronger, which is huge because up until this point, not only were my heels cracking, but my baby toe nail was splitting right down the middle from being so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am telling you, if you have dry skin, or hair, you HAVE to get this shea butter. Your hair and skin will love you for it. There is one little piece of advice I have though...because this is pure shea butter, then scent might be a little off putting to some, so a good essential oil will help with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free for review purposes, but all opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter I received from Cleopatra’s Choice ! It was packaged perfectly (for the weather) &amp; comes hard packed in a plastic tub for easy storage! I love that shea butter has so many different uses &amp; does so many things! I have acne prone skin &amp; suffer from hyper-pigmentation &amp; I love the fact that this shea butter reduces my dark spots!</li>
    <li> without any doubts, best products for ur face.</li>
    <li> Looks great! Can&#x27;t wait to make my lotion with it.  Will update after....</li>
    <li> I feel great when i spread this butter on my leg.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for skin, have used on my hair ends too. I feel my dry skin during winter very soft and supple, moisturizer. Highly recommend for dry skin people. Apply it overnight and the skin is nourished for the entire day. I used it on my 3 month old baby&#x27;s cheeks and her redness is gone. I love natural products and this is perfect, completely natural and provides desired results!! Way too good!</li>
    <li> Yay! I finally found the Shea Butter that&#x27;s found at the African Market area in NYC! I live in Florida now and couldn&#x27;t find similar. If you know anything about Shea Butter...it&#x27;s truly effective in its natural form. I warm it in the palm of my hands and then just rub it onto my skin. Yes, it&#x27;s not super pleasant smelling, but I put some light perfume and it does the trick. This stuff is really our miracle cream...my husband has Seborrheic dermatitis and it really works in controlling the flaking all around his face and neck! I used it for both pregnancies--and did not get any stretch marks (my babies were both over 8 1/2 pounds and I&#x27;m only 5&#x27;2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;--Works at controlling dandruff and skin issues for our family&lt;br /&gt;--Super smooth and shiny skin&lt;br /&gt;--Soft and natural&lt;br /&gt;--I use a little on my curly hair and helps with the frizz and fly-away (it&#x27;s greasy but I have super dry hair so it works)&lt;br /&gt;--Didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks!!! I was HUGE&lt;br /&gt;--I&#x27;m using it now for anti-wrinkle cream...will see if that&#x27;s effective! LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;--Needs work to put on...you have to rub it around and warm it to make it spread (or follow the instructions that the seller provides)&lt;br /&gt;--Greasy (for those who mind)&lt;br /&gt;--Smell isn&#x27;t super pleasant (it&#x27;s okay to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff...it comes in a tub and easy to open and close.</li>
    <li> Excellent, as described. Already used it all up, in my homemade soap and lip balm</li>
    <li> I have tried several top-of-the-line products and some not so top-of-the-line to moisturize my skin and nothing has worked like this product has.  I even use it as my face moisturizer and I am not breaking out.  I believe this has become a permanent part of my personal care regimen.  They also shipped it very quickly after I ordered. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Harder than I was expecting.  Not an entirely pleasant scent, but in the small quantities I&#x27;m using it, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> We used this in a recipe to make a gentle soap and it worked great!</li>
    <li> The shea butter is wonderful. I use  it on myself and my newborn baby girl. It&#x27;s great for the chest of breastfeeding mom&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve been using our shea butter for 9 months and love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for sunburns, needs to be melted in warm water or whipped for use though</li>
    <li> I use it as a nightime face moisturizer, my elbows and especially on my heels.  This product gets buttery soft when you rub it between your hands before applying  it on the skin. I love love love the smell and how it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> Great Product! This shea butter has an awesome texture and works wonderfully for what I need it for!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used shea butter of any kind. I&#x27;m excited to have had the opportunity to try it out. This product comes in a very nice resealable container so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room. The lid is easy to open. Once you get inside, there&#x27;s a nice container full of shea butter waiting for you. It comes in two kinds. Yellow or ivory. I received the ivory product. This has helped my daughter with her eczema and has helped me with my dry heels. My biggest reason for ever using it will be during the winter when my skin gets really dried out. I have to use an awful lot of lotion to keep it moisturized, so I&#x27;m hoping this will be the replacement for it. Also, as a mom who has gone through 2 pregnancies now, my stretch marks also tend to get dried out from time to time during the winter, so I plan on using it for that reason too. You can use this product sparingly for it to do what it&#x27;s purpose is. You don&#x27;t have to fill your hand up with it like you do lotions. I love this product and will make sure to come back during the winter sometime to update my review.</li>
    <li> High quality Shea, i used this to make whipped Shea for my hair and also a lip butter and aloe juice whip for a conditioner. it absorbs so easily into my hair and skin instead of just sitting on top of it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue once absorbed like the Shea i get from the local bss. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter! I make my own lotions and body butter so I really like to find the best ingredients I can. This is it! This shea butter is all natural and organic! It smells great! It feels great! It&#x27;s very high quality! It mixed and blended well with the other ingredients! Everyone that I normally give lotion to was asking me if I did something different with my formula! They said their skin was even softer and more supple than before!! I am happy to recieve this product to review! I highly recommend this high quality shea butter.</li>
    <li> Seems to be exactly as described. I mixed it with coconut oil and olive oil as a lotion and it works great!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I now am exploring how to make my own body creams using this shea butter.  All of my results have been outstanding!  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> It is a little to hard to get out of the container. Its almost like I need a knife or some kind of tool to scrape it out, so I am using the other product that I bought from amazon.  I will use it, because I like the way it works on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely enjoyed this product to no end! I branched a little but out of my comfort zone and tried to make lotion bars. I can say with certainty, that I will be making these again and again. I put the Raw Shea Butter in a double boiler along with a few other ingredients I bought off of amazon and and a few of my favorite essential oils and it has been a life saver for my hands. The Shea Butter has a nice texture and smell. The color is also a nice mild color instead of a dark yellow that you sometimes see in fake products. I am so happy with Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice! Thanks for letting me review and try out this wonderfully natural product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to see if it would help With my psoriasis and I absolutely love it. I use it in the morning and at night and in just a couple of weeks I have seen a significant change in the appearance of my skin. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I like the fact I can moisturize my skin with a 100% natural ingredient. It does makes my skin soft. I even use it on my face at night. But the smell is not particularly pleasant. It reminds me of the detergent bars that was used in South Asia during my childhood. But I am planning to use it with some nice-smelling essential oil to solve the problem</li>
    <li> When I received Cleopatra’s Choice Raw Shea Butter in ivory color it was in a nice resealable container. The label has some really useful information on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was going to be my first attempt at making anything homemade of this type. Because Dylan and I have skin reactions to most things, such as lotions and body washes Etc. I needed to do a bit of research on components needed to make these things at home. To be completely honest, it is extremely expensive to start making your own soap and lotion. Once you have most of the essential oils you need to make the things that you use every day, the oils will last a really long time. The oils needed for the recipe that I found in Cleopatra choice&#x27;s free downloadable recipe book eczema relief butter were coconut oil, lavender essential oil, cedarwood essential oil, vitamin E oil. I didn’t have any of these, but I was on a mission to make my son some eczema relief butter that I knew exactly what was inside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleopatra’s choice raw Shea butter is made with only the best Grade A Shea butter. Which means it has all the best that any Shea Butter can offer. The best for healing and moisturizing. Dylan and I have been using Cleopatra’s choice homemade recipe Eczema relief butter made with Cleopatra’s choice raw Shea butter in the color ivory for the last few days. Let me tell you something, this is one of the best moisturizers I have used on Dylans eczema yet! He has already been itching a lot less. Anyone who knows Dylan knows he has almost zero self-control when it comes to his scratching and he does it a lot. I have not heard once from his school that he has been scratching, nor do I see him doing it a lot at home. I truly believe Cleopatra&#x27;s choice offers a great grade A product. I would recommend it anyone planning to make their own recipes with a great Grade A Shea Butter. Try this product first!</li>
    <li> I love Cloepatra&#x27;s Choice Shea Butter.  It arrived fast and packaged nicely. Great consistency and smell.  It works beautifully in my lotion, lotion bars and creams.  I LOVE shea butter  in lotions!  Even put some in a shampoo recipe today. I will certainly buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great product!  This is my 2nd purchase.  I will continue to use this Shea butter for great skin.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent service.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I wanted. I large quantity of quality shea butter for not a lot of money. Neatly packaged in a little plastic tub, it&#x27;s intensely moisturizing and works great in my soaps and body butters.</li>
    <li> Definitely will come back for more..love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. When you rub the Shea butter in your hands, it becomes smooth and creamy. Great quality</li>
    <li> I make my own skin and hair shea whip and Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Organic Shea Butter is the  bomb.com. It melts upon touch, it makes my skin and hair soft. My hair is much more manageable and shiny upon use.  I mix it with Mango butter and Coconut Oil and it&#x27;s luxurious!  I also use it as a lip balm.  It smells divine BTW!</li>
    <li> I love this shea butter. I recieved the ivory rather quickly. It comes as a hard, dense product. I used it as is for a week and loved it especially on the driest areas I have, like my ankles and feet. Enjoying it as much as I did straight out of the container, I decided to use only half to make a whipped shea butter lotion that was easily spreadable. It came out fine and smooth, not grainy or lumpy even with add-ins. Speads on beautifully and both the original and whipped I made absorb well, leaving no oily or greasy residue. It doesn&#x27;t have any overwhelming scent, pretty light actually. I am definitely using this brand again for future batches of lotions and skin care products. It blends well with other ingredients, stays light, absorbs great, no residue, and doesn&#x27;t over power anything.</li>
    <li> Will definitely buy again whip very good was easy to get out of the container did very well in my shea butter sugar scrub bar and cubes and soap</li>
    <li> After researching where I was going to get the best Shea butter for the least amount of money, Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice was the clear winner. I have 5 children that I use Shea on so spending a lot of money is not an option because it goes faster for us. The price is reasonable and the product is what it says it is. The packaging was fine and it delivered when promised. I noticed some people complained of the scent or texture but that is what raw Shea is. I am not a huge fan of the Shea scent so I add some essential oils for their benefits and the fragrance. When applying it unmixed the scent doesn&#x27;t stay for too long.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with what I decided on and I will purchase from Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice again.</li>
    <li> My skin has always been a source of compliments. As I reach further into my thirties, I don&#x27;t want that to stop. I am choosing to approach my skin care with all-natural products, such as this shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 16oz of wax-like shea butter comes in a resealable plastic tub. It is rich in vitamins for soothing, hydrating, and protecting skin. It even stands in for sunscreen and diaper rash cream. The manufacturer labels when the product batch is produced, so I know how fresh my tub is. There is also a free ebook with recipes involving shae butter, if you want to experiment with not applying it straight by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have purchased high-end skin products previously, shea butter was one of the key ingredients which proved the quality of the formula. I never realized that the shea butter could be ordered by itself. The texture needs a long time to absorb (over night for best results), but I like the way it makes my skin feel. And, 16oz is a lot for me to use!</li>
    <li> I love this Shea butter. Put on my face every night! Good quality and no extra additives.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase from Cleopatra for this Shea butter. I have eczema and I don&#x27;t want to use those over the counter creams anymore. So I decided to make my own. I use the butter mix with other oils and I use it on my whole body after shower/bath. I also use it on my face when my face feel dry during winter. I have to say my skin is super soft and it did help improve my dry patches. I even use it on my lips as well. The container can last for a long time!!!!</li>
    <li> The organic shea butter is great for dry skin. I have dry skin and my daughter has eczema. I used it on the dry patches and it relieved her of the itching. The shea butter is packed in there so don&#x27;t be afraid to get it out and use it. I like that it is organic. You can use this for all sorts of skin problems like eczema and dry skin. I was able to get the shea butter at a great price and I wanted to share my experience.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE shea butter. My husband and I have been using it almost exclusively for a few years for any skin dryness and chap stick. My man uses it mixed with a gel for an all natural hair product that works great for calming and nourishing his thick curly locks. Out of all the shea butter we&#x27;ve gotten, this is definitely some of the highest grade. Very clean smelling, no rancidity. LOVE that it&#x27;s organic too.</li>
    <li> Hard as a rock...you have to really manipulate it in order to use. Expected a softer smoother texture.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is amazing! It&#x27;s not at all gritty like some can be. It&#x27;s silky smooth and has a light Shea fragrance. It makes my skin SO soft! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product from this seller several times and they have always been prompt and friendly. I love the product and recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Very soft and smooth! I love the feeling on my skin. I used it on my rough spots, I have mild eczema and it works fantastically for it! My rough bumps are disappearing and my skin is being left very soft. I love this product. I also use it on my 11 month old because he has eczema and I&#x27;ve tried the creams the doctor prescribed and bunch of different lotions but this works great on his skin and it&#x27;s gentle for him also! I would definitely recommend this product if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is the best!  I have dry, sensitive skin, made worse by cold New England winters. I apply this every night before bed &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for everyday use.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> YESSS! Love that this is organic AND fair trade! Lovely, lovely product! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love Shea butter. I use it to make hair conditioner for myself and my daughter. You can also put it on your skin to help relieve dry skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  Can not wait to use.  Feels high quality.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> Shea butter is a must have for soft, healthy hair and skin. This works great in keeping my hair moisturized throughout the day as well as my skin. I add oils to it and love it! Great hair and skin care must have!</li>
    <li> This product is of great quality and its uses are endless. I have used it on myself and others in my home and everyone loves it. It&#x27;s a pretty big container and you only need a small amount. I highly recommend purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good about this product. I love it. I recently began working with essential oils and this Shea butter is an amazing product to use with the oils. I&#x27;ve also been using it alone and I may be even more impressed at the results I get using it straight from container and not mixing it with anything. My feet are so soft, my sun spots have faded on my face and my lips are not dry or cracked anymore. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This totally exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s a giant tube and doesn&#x27;t really have any smell when rubbed in. It has totally repaired my hands after the rough winter. I also put it on my feet with thick socks and has made a hugh difference.</li>
    <li> I live in Minnesota and this product came to me rock hard in February.  I had to call to find out (before writing a review) if it&#x27;s supposed to be rock hard.  Well yes.  It is temperature sensitive.  They told me to pull off a chip of it and warm it in my hands for a brief moment and then spread it on my skin.  It worked!  What I noticed is that my eczema isn&#x27;t so bad when I use the shea butter (now I just need to practice consistency *smile*).  My skin feels super soft and adequately moisturized.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:3fdd66b826cd5c38ca0ce80921423927]] I received this product for testing and review. I am such a huge fan of Shea Butter so when I received Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Organic Shea Butter, I really excited to try it out and make my own body butter. The product arrived promptly as expected, secure in package. One thing is that, I did not receive was the FREE 50 Page Shea Butter Reference Guide E-Book with Recipes &amp; Tips that comes with the product when you order. And make sure you use only 100% essential oils to get the highest scent possible if you are going to use a scent.&lt;br /&gt;Original state of unrefined organic shea butter can be very hard and sometimes not so easy to apply. The product I received was not that hard. I could scoop it with a spoon with ease. I like to whip up a batch of body butter, using organic shea butter, essential oils and a base oil .Here&#x27;s a really simple recipe to try.&lt;br /&gt;4oz of Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice Organic Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;2 tbs of a base oil (example: almond, extra virgin olive oil)&lt;br /&gt;15-20 drops of essentials (example: lavender, peppermint)&lt;br /&gt;using essential oils is only an optional, it&#x27;s just nice to have a scent of choice&lt;br /&gt;mixing bowl&lt;br /&gt;electric or whisk mixer&lt;br /&gt;empty, clean 8oz jars or bowls, something with a lid so you can cover and keep in room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;Do not heat your shea butter. Just scoop it into the blender along with the base oil and essential oil, whip it up, scoop into jars/bowl and you are ready to apply. So easy. I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy this product and be sure to check out all the products by this seller.</li>
    <li> I love the book that came with the product with different recipes of things to make work it!! Fun for months to come!</li>
    <li> I like this Shea butter, great.</li>
    <li> my husband and son have very sensitive skin ordered this for them because their skin is very dry this winter. my husband already wants me to order more after 1 week</li>
    <li> Wonderful shea butter. I use it to make lotion for my kids. My mother, who has really sensitive skin, used it and really liked it. It blends very well. The smell is earthy, but pretty mild.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It is so incredibly soft! I have dry hands and i use this on them and it doesnt leave it all greasy or dry out fast like most lotions. They only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is the container was cracked when i recieved it.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I have never used a product like this before. It is very high quality and lives up to the claims. I only wish I had understood that it really can&#x27;t be used on its own, it has to be melted down and mixed with other things to be made into lotions, soap, and other products.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Organic. A little goes a long way. My skin is so smooth and it absorbs quickly. Non greasy. I also use this to make deodorant and chapstick. My acne scars are vanishing. And my skin stays moisturized all day. I apply right before bed and it last all day.</li>
    <li> Awesome clean and soft</li>
    <li> The shea butter mixes up to the nicest smoothest butters!!  I have used the shea butter to make a magnesium  lotion for my husband as well as a few skin hydrating &amp;#34;butters&amp;#34;.  It mixes nicely with other oils and essential oils, there is a slight nutty type of scent to it but it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the essential oil scents.  It is also clean looking in appearance so that my end products don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34;.  It comes in a handy resealable package that you can open and close multiple times.  This is much nicer than the butters that come in a bag and you have to search for containers to store it.  I would definitely purchase this one again and suggest it to my friends.</li>
    <li> A product people need to try a least once. You will be hooked!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Soft enough to scoop right out of the tub and rub on skin. I used it to make homemade lotion and body wash. Smells really good too.</li>
