<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good products. So far so good</li>
    <li> I have used for one month and have not felt different. I guess I will have to use more or order more.</li>
    <li> Seller sends great follow-up note. Was pleased to see this item listed in &amp;#34;top 10 vitamin C serums&amp;#34; &amp; price is great. I like the serum.  And, importantly, it is easy to apply sun screen/moisturizer over this serum without it &amp;#34;bubbling up&amp;#34; or remaining sticky.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 6 weeks, and I do see a change in my skin. I don&#x27;t have fine lines, but do have spots, which have been diminished and less noticeable. I will reorder.</li>
    <li> Does what it says,doesn&#x27;t breakout my skin and has almost no scent. Love it</li>
    <li> I just started using the product a couple of days ago, and so far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;I like how it absorbs quickly into my skin and it seems to provide good moisture.</li>
    <li> Love this product, have ordered it three times and will continue to. Great customer service as well!!  : )</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days but so far it&#x27;s a good product. Dries very quickly, had no smell and it appears to be helping my dry skin issue.</li>
    <li> I am using this C serum for about a week by now.  Having sensitive skin, I did it once a day for 3-4 days,  but now started 2x a day. Absolutely the best I tried so far.!!! I used everything from most expensive, like Strivectin,  down to Perricone MD, Peter Thomas Roth, ( department stores staff was a total waste of money for me).  Murad line I liked the best and am using for about 2 years by now.  As much as I try to love my aging and be generous to myself, It becomes expensive to use it on a regular basis. Murad intensive Anti- Diffusing Serum is about $75 per bottle was the best before I tried this C serum. After I tried this one, I can&#x27;t believe the difference.  You can really feel the tightness, wrinkles literally diminished, absorbed immediately, no sticky residue and look at the price. Best of all it is all really natural, so, I found the best anti-aging treatment.  My face never looked that good.  The service is great, I will definitely switch to this one.</li>
    <li> 3 stars? I don&#x27;t know. I am not sure this did anything for me but it didn&#x27;t cause me any problems either. My husband and I both use it and he said his face felt tighter. I really don&#x27;t know - it&#x27;s one of those things that are blah. We both tolerated it well, but really saw no visible changes after a full bottle so that is why the 3 stars. I think I am sticking with the Dermesse C that is sold by the medical spa I go to. I also did not like the coupon on the bottle. Made it seem cheap. Dermesse or Obagi don&#x27;t have coupons on the bottle. Seems a bit desperate to me. Overall, I am just not sure this did anything but it&#x27;s so cheap that I might order another bottle just in case it is doing something...</li>
    <li> I love this serum! My face is soft, bright, and clear. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first, but I must say I really like this product. My skin looks so much better, and with make up even better yet. I really think it&#x27;s helping the brown spots from the sun fade away. I am 60 yrs old and very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I like that my skin seems brighter and definitely softer. I haven&#x27;t seen many changes in terms of lighter sun spots but that may just take time. I will keep using the Vitamin C serum for sure. Customer service for Truck in Naturals is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my two serums and the changes I&#x27;ve noticed in my skin in just a few weeks. I&#x27;m a new mommy and look tired all the time. Since I&#x27;ve started with the HA and Vitamin C, my skin has a nice glow to it, my pores are smaller, and I just look more awake. Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term benefits of these products.</li>
    <li> I like the product but it irritated my skin a little.</li>
    <li> I love the serum I purchased from your company. I&#x27;m 43 years old and a RN. I am very particular about the products I use on my face. I know what products work on the surface on the skin and which products penetrate deeper into the skin&#x27;s layers. I do use a Retin-A cream 0.05% that has worked well for me. However, I can only use it a few times per week. I have tried to take good care of my skin as an adult. People often mistake me for 10-15 years younger than my age. I want to hang onto that!  I had been looking for a good Vitamin C serum that had the right type of Vitamin C and that was affordable. I came across your product on Amazon. It seemed to fit both of my criteria for a serum. I started using it 2 times a day and am really happy with the results. My skin is definitely smoother and more radiant. I have also noticed that the hormonal blemishes that I usually get on my chin every month, despite the use of Retin-A, have completely vanished by adding the Vitamin C serum to my daily skin care regime.  I am so pleased with the product. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term results will be.</li>
    <li> I have used other C products but discontinued their use as they were to strong for my skin type which is very sensitive.  I thought I would try again to use a different brand after reading how geat C is for the skin and reading the reviews for this product GLAD I did!  I have been using for 3 nights and already see a big change in my skin First for me is , it did not irritate my skin no redness actually it&#x27;s very soothing and my skin has a clarity I have not seen in a long time also I love that you can use under the eyes which I was hesitant to do but Glad I did!  No problem only wonderful results - like brightness, less lined . no puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it does not sit on the skin it dries within seconds.  I only expect better &amp; better results I cannot wait if it has made this difference in 3 days what will it do in the future!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used! My friends started noticing the results before I did.</li>
    <li> breaks my face out , im african american , very light toned , waste of money</li>
    <li> DO YOURSELF, AND YOUR FACE A FAVOR, AND USE THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&lt;br /&gt;USING IT TWICE A DAY WILL PROVIDE QUICK, NOTICEABLE RESULTS. YOU WILL BE AMAZED.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, LET ME ADD ANOTHER KEY TO THE STORY. I WAS HAVING A SURGICAL PROCEDURE AND HAD TO&lt;br /&gt;FAST FOR 24 HOURS. WHEN I AWOKE AT 6 AM THE MORNING OF THE PROCEDURE, LOOKED IN&lt;br /&gt;THE MIRROR AND COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES. I POSITIVELY LOOKED 10 YEARS YOUNGER.&lt;br /&gt;WRINKLES WERE GONE AND MY FACE HAD A SIGNIFICANT GLOW ABOUT IT. AND LET ME TELL YOU, FASTING FOR THAT LONG OF TIME CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STRESS. BUT THERE I WAS, LOOKING AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR IN AMAZEMENT.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER I WAS HOME AND ABLE TO GET MY WITS ABOUT ME I GOOGLED FASTING RESULTS ON SKIN (can&#x27;t remember the exact words) AND SURE ENOUGH FASTING WILL CAUSE A POSITIVE CHANGE IN YOUR SKIN&lt;br /&gt;TONE. OF COURSE, USING THE SERUM IS MUCH MORE CONVENIENT. BUT I PLAN TO CONTINUE TO USE&lt;br /&gt;THE SERUM TWICE A DAY, EVERYDAY, AS WELL AS FAST OCCASIONALLY (24 hours). POSSIBLY ONCE A MONTH. GOGGLE IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.  BUT DO NOT GIVE UP THE SERUM. YOU NEED TO USE IT&lt;br /&gt;TWICE A DAY TO REALLY SEE THE RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;SINCERELY,&lt;br /&gt;LINDA&lt;br /&gt;NEW JERSEY</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the customer reviews---I was basically at my wits end---suffering from breakouts at 44?? come on--so unfair.  Nothing was working.  I purchased this--and have been using it morning and night for a month---maybe missing one or two times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I freaking love this stuff!!!  Seriously---i have never had anything make such a difference in my skin.  I have not had any new breakouts---i&#x27;m still waiting for some of the marks from previous blemishes to clear up---but i&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  I&#x27;m going to re-order in a few days.  Seriously impressed---this stuff actually works!  My skin is brighter---more vibrant--looks younger---I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve ever had a previous product had that kind of impact.  I&#x27;m at the bottom of the bottle and have immediatley ordered another one.  How often can you say that about a product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just told my sister about it---I think she&#x27;ll love it.  Give it a try --- i would pay 50 bucks a pop for this stuff, it&#x27;s that good.  -ck</li>
    <li> Very good price .  Beats what I&#x27;ve been paying at another site.  Good product.</li>
    <li> So far so good...may have to update to 5 stars once I finish the bottle and start on a second.  It absorbs very nicely and can be worn under anything, it seems.  I have also been taking liver supplements which help your skin so I need to experiment to find out what is actually making the most impact.  That said, the ingredients in this serum are top-notch and so is customer service!</li>
    <li> The serum works wonder. I saw a major difference in the texture and tone of my skin in just two weeks. Best of all its non-greasy!!!!  I have very greasy skin and this product did not cause me to have any breakouts. I give it 5 stars and will continue to buy more and more. Hoping that it can come in a bigger size too.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful on the skin, not real greasy like many oils. Leaves skin soft and subtle. I highly recommend. Good for fine lines and wrinkles. Also, cellulite, scars, imperfections, and sun damage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; </li>
    <li> I am 24 years old and I bought this product in hopes that it would reduce the two wrinkles I have on my forehead. I purchased the product 2 weeks ago and although I do not notice anything different with my wrinkles, I have noticed a HUGE different in my acne scars around my mouth area. After I wash my face and let it dry I use this product all over my face. You must moisturize since it does leave your face feeling a little sticky. I use the Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture after this serum. Everyday when I wake up I have noticed that my acne scars are becoming less red. I dont expect this product to help fade my wrinkles as fast as my acne scars, but I am super happy with this purchase. If you have acne scars (red marks, not pits) this product is a must try!!!</li>
    <li> Good, but found another product that worked as well for less money</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I have seen a dramatic change but I can see a change in just the short time I have been using your product.  My skin is softer and my makeup I going on much smoother (less noticeable lines, etc.). Thank you very much for creating such a great product (and reasonably priced).  I have been recommending it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Vitamin C Serum.  I am 57 yo. This is a very nice product!  I received my first two bottles quickly and began right away with 2 x daily face and hand treatments under some soothing lotion I have for all over body use.  The serum has a silky texture which absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling nice and smooth.  I have extremely sensitive skin due to some health issues, yet this nice serum did not cause any discomfort whatsoever!  So far, after only a little over two weeks of use I am beginning to see some improvements in the fine, deep lines around mouth.  They are fuller looking and less pronounced.  My skin also looks a little brighter and is much less sore.  Before starting this serum, even the shampoo running over my face in the shower would sometimes sting my skin, but this has stopped completely which is WONDERFUL!  Customer service has been awesome!  I received detailed instructions on how to use the product to my best advantage shortly after I purchased it.  I expecially love that this serum has only natural ingredients and is cruelty free.  I am so pleased that I may even splurge on my next order and get the extra HA serum to go with it!</li>
    <li> this serum is absolutely worth the risk. my pores have closed, skin is less dry around my nose/cheeks/lips (i use a very strong facial wash for adult acne), forehead is less oily throughout the day. totally addicted!!!!!</li>
    <li> so far its not working</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Truskin Naturals Serum. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product my skin looks and feels more smooth and firm. I&#x27;ve had no negative reactions since I&#x27;ve been using this product and I&#x27;m pregnant and have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s has been amazing! I also love how quickly the product absorbs into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and the company&#x27;s customer service is excellent!!! I will continue to use this product!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product it works on my skin very well aaI will buy it again.thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> This affordable vitamin c serum makes my skin brighter, less noticeable for the dark spot. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am liking the serum so much that I ordered 3 more bottles.  I initially tried it for age spots which I have on my face.  It is fading these spots.  They are still there, but much less noticeable.  My skin just has a nice even tone to it.  Looks brighter too.  I am trying to remember to put it on the back of my hands at night.  I have a spot there that I could not get to fully heal.  It is now just a red spot.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, my skin has never looked better.  The company is also wonderful, they have contacted me on every bottle I have bought and made sure I was happy</li>
    <li> No significant changes.  Still trying.</li>
    <li> It is good...only been using it for a week and I see really nice results. Skin looks firmer and brighter too.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks I think I see some improvement..</li>
    <li> to me, there is no effect, feel like just a waste of money; buy a moisturizer over the counter instead</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but these products have worked have worked so well for me that I had to share it with everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I go further, let me explain what my issues were and the reason I&#x27;d  ordered your products....during the last few months, I&#x27;d developed extremely bad acne on my face- these were so painful and looked like welts. I was totally confounded and I attributed  it to being menopausal &#x27;cause I  had very clear skin and acne was never my problem growing up.Needless to say it was very concerning...I bought many expensive over the counter products and nothing seemed to help.So, I decided to give this serum  products a try and I must say it has made a marked improvement in my skin..my bumps have cleared and the skin is so  much smoother! It saved  saved me a trip to the dermatologist  as I was vary of the harsh chemicals they would probably prescribe. Do give this a try...you will NOT be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also bought the Retinol serum(same brand) and use it at night,,,both are amazing products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the C...already ordered another bottle and one for my mother in law who noticed a difference in my skin in just 2 weeks and asked what I was doing...I don&#x27;t think I could live with out this product!!!!!  Also, AWESOME customer service- all of my questions were answered within 5 hours or less!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beginning to notice an improvement in my skin and will continue to use this product. It is drying to the skin and moisturizer is needed.</li>
    <li> I have been on a mission for a couple of years now, to get my skin to the point where I would no longer need to use any foundation. I had noticed that wherever fine lines had started to appear, the application of any liquid, cream or powder  accentuated them! Although I never had &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin, I did need to cover a few freckles and uneven skin tone and in the past, makeup seemed to be the answer. Now, I see that NOT using a cover-up is giving my skin a younger, fresher appearance. The Vitamin C Serum appears to be working with regard to evening out my skin tone, softening the fine lines and lightening my freckles. Needless to say, I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I found theTruSkin vitamin C to be very silky and moisturizing.  I had been using another brand, which I did like a lot,but decided to try another company based upon the volume of positive reviews it received.  I am certainly glad that I did.....this product is not as drying and really makes your skin look and feel radiant.  The customer service is beyond excellent.......Erica, one of the co-founders, corresponds, answers any questions you may have and takes a personal interest in her customers.</li>
    <li> not bad...  but still no real change?  i will keep using until it is gone.</li>
    <li> The product works as described. Happy with the positive result</li>
    <li> So far I am loving this serum! It hasn&#x27;t been quite 2 weeks yet, but I already feel and see improvement. My skin looks tighter and brighter, especially under my eyes :) i also love how it absorbs so quickly!  This is definitely a product I plan on using for a long time, thank you!</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time and it does work</li>
    <li> The serum is wonderful.  I am very particular about my skin care and found your product to be superb.  I have been exfoliating for more than three years now—and this product enhances the experience.</li>
    <li> This product helped me a lot in reducing the brown spots on my face as well as my hands. The results was noticeable after almost three weeks. I do strongly recommend it to those who wish  their skin a shade  lighter!</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  I use a couple drops in the morning after my toner and in the evening before my retinol cream.  It took me a day or two to get used to the feeling of a serum on my skin, but now I just love it.  I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked better without makeup.  I like that it is a more natural product and that it is relatively inexpensive.  I was using a more expensive serum before without any results.  I think that my pores are smaller and my wrinkles are fading, and I have only been using it for about a month.  My skin feels softer and I think it looks brighter in the morning.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see a change</li>
    <li> Have been using for one month has not rid me of age spots but my skin is brighter.  It seems to have smoothed and evened out my skin tone. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Wow..Amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Words cannot explain how happy I am with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that seem to react to everything. I stress quite often, experience lack of sleep due to my newborn, and have pretty much always had dark circles under my eyes. I also breakout every so often and I have the type of skin that blemishes so easily from these breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after using this product for 2 days (once in the am and once in the pm), I saw such noticeable results. 😊 my blemishes are definitely diminishing and the skin around my eyes look more youthful. My skin looks and feels so much more radiant that I&#x27;m getting confident if I continue to use this, I may end up not having to use foundation anymore- which is something I&#x27;ve always dreamed of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and great results.&lt;br /&gt;My advice, don&#x27;t give up on your face. At least give this product a try. The price so well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;😊😊😊😊😊</li>
    <li> This has been truly amazing.  I use this along with Merle Norman moisture</li>
    <li> The first 10 days my skin was a little flaky, but I keep using it every night and now at 20 days I am so pleased with the results.  I have been getting  lots of compliments on my skin.  So super soft and moist without being oily, less dark pigmentation and lines are lessening already.  I will be reordering!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t not see much change...I have bad sun spots so I was hoping this would blend my skin but I was wrong. I used it twice a day and still no real change in my area where I needed.</li>
    <li> I really like it ,my skin is more brighter, pores are smaller,I had sun damaged skin, everything is cleared, my face is even,&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the  serum again. Thanks,  you guys are doing a great job, I love your product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a change already and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week! I will order the other products as well. I live in a dry climate and this helped immediately. Paired with my regular moisturizer it&#x27;s really giving me a great boost. Also, I&#x27;ve moved into applying it morning and night and it works well under my makeup in the day. No reaction from my skin and I tend to be sensitive and dry. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am so thrilled about this C serum. I have been using it am/pm for a few weeks and my skin looks renewed, brighter and just all around younger. I can&#x27;t wait for continued use of it to see what more it can do. It glides on smoothly and you can easily put on moisturizer a minute or two afterwards. A couple of people I know have just recently asked what I have been doing to my skin.  I just LOVE it!!!!!! I also just ordered the new retinol serum.  Erica from Truskin Naturals is really helpful as well and she has offered coupons for me to try the other products. Give it a try. You can&#x27;t beat the price either and the guarantee!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I noticed my skin was smoother the first application. I&#x27;m using it twice a day and am looking forward to even more improvement. Loved a follow up email that was responded to personally. I&#x27;m excited!</li>
    <li> Excellent for lightening dark spots and evening out skin tone.</li>
    <li> I have been seen any change in my skin.</li>
    <li> Saw results after first use love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!! I can see a significant difference in less than 2 weeks. Skin is more clear, and so soft. Will Definitely order the serum again!!!</li>
    <li> very nice product! Skin texture inproving</li>
    <li> so far i love it.  Will buy more.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It makes my skin glow and I have noticed that my fine lines are less visible and the serum is also regulating my oily skin. Buy and enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference.  Other than more hydration of my skin, the fine lines are no less visible.  Maybe a coincidence, but this serum broke my neck and upper chest out too.  I will finish off the bottle on my face, but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Hi, my English not very good, but I am received vitamin C , I use only 3 week and my skin good, soft, and diferent my image.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy because Erica employeer mak feedback, and your job its EXCELENTE, congratulation AMAZON this lady...&lt;br /&gt;congratulation!! good job ERICA&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Sandra Miami Fl</li>
    <li> I have only used it two days so far so good will report more later</li>
    <li> I waited three weeks to review this product, but I have to say, I&#x27;ve seen great results after just the first use! I apply the product both morning and night, and follow with my favorite moisturizer (as directed). My skin loves this stuff and I can honestly say that I&#x27;m IN LOVE with it. Not only is it a great value, but the co-founder Erica emailed me just to ask how it was working for me, and answered all my questions! I&#x27;ve never had a seller ask how I liked their product before on Amazon &amp; I was truly blown away with the whole experience! They even include a code on their bottle for 50% off your next one (limited promotion). EXCELLENT product...EXCELLENT customer service &#x3D; one HAPPY customer!!! I got my mom hooked, too. THANKS ERICA!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this serum. It has only been a short time that I have been using it and my skin definitely is showing improvement. It feels great and appears brighter,dark spots seem less prominent. Very happy with your product. Great customer service. Will definitely purchase products from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great deal.&lt;br /&gt;Great for the face!</li>
    <li> I have tried other CE formulas, most were more expensive. I definitely will continue with this product. It&#x27;s difficult to know exactly what product is reducing fine lines since I use a variety of facial products.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Feels great and there&#x27;s no strong smell so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I have been sick for the past three days, and started using this 2 days ago. I cannot account for anyone else, but I noticed effects immediately. Under my make up, which is not much, my face looks incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! I believe your product far out weighs any product out there. That is just my opinion!</li>
    <li> Tried this and it is fantastic. Face and neck have noticeable improvement. Will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> I love the serum! I feel like my skin is brighter and softer since using it. I do also use glycol and lactic acid peels and retin A so I am not sure of its a combination effect from all of these other treatments but I do like the serum and it was a great value. I will definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> 2x/day every day for several weeks (just about a month now). Almost no difference to uneven skin tone and no difference to dark spots.    Update: its been about 2 months. Bumping it up by 1 star. One of my spots does seem to be fading but its pretty subtle. I wouldn&#x27;t call it dramatic but it does seem to work for that one spot. Other spots have yet to see any benefits. Will use the rest of it and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually satisfied with the serum. I use it on a part of my face that some skin was removed from waxing. It left a dark spot. I put the serum on that spot everyday and see an improvement. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product and will refer others to use it. Thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  This serum has calmed my rosacea prone skin. My face is softer, clearer with less noticeable dark spots and I&#x27;ve had no irritation whatsoever.  It is reasonably priced and has done more for my skin than much costlier serums that I&#x27;ve used for many years. I&#x27;m 67 yrs. old but my skin doesn&#x27;t look it.  I will continue to use this product and highly recommend to anyone with sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My skin looks better after only using a few weeks and it&#x27;s very light. The customer service is like no other! They followed up with me to see how if I liked the product or not. Will definitely buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I really love your serum. It has a great texture that absorbs right away and it really works! I have very fair and sensitive skin and have experienced no irritation from your product. I have a few sun spots that are fading since I started using your product. I do plan to re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I started using this because I spend a lot of time in the sun and believe in sunscreen due to the chemicals in it. I love the fact that this serum is all natural ingredients. I think it&#x27;s possible that one could take this stuff orally and it just might corrects a lot of other ailments too. I got great customer service from Erin.  She helped me to understand how to use this with their Retinol since I&#x27;m in the sun a lot. She&#x27;s like your own personal esthetician! I can really see the difference. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of things for my brown spot to my face after 3 week I can I see the different</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  It absorbs quickly as promised.  I feel my skin is looking better and better everyday.  Try it and you&#x27;ll be as hooked as I am!</li>
    <li> Have bought this before and like it.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  My skin is brighter and feels softer to the touch.  I have been using it just once a day, but will begin to use twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have used this C Serum for a couple of weeks now.  I love it!  It is not sticky and it absorbs quickly allowing me to apply moisturizer.  I am definitely not &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; and  I am hoping it fades some of the light brown spots I have from sun damage.  I have definitely seen an improvement in the pores on my nose.  I think I will also try their  Hyaluronic Acid Serum because of the ingredients I have seen listed.  I will be purchasing this again and I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and a half. I have very oily skin that is prone to breakouts and this product did not aggravate my skin. My skin is smoother and I have less breakouts. Will definitely be buying this again but a little goes a long way so, it won&#x27;t be anytime soon. Great serum!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have ever tried for my face and I have tried many. My skin has never been this soft and smooth. I noticed a difference in 2 weeks. I will continue to use this product forever.</li>
    <li> Having a previous positive experience with using both a 7.5% Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid packaged separately and used together through another company at a considerably higher price point, I was quite pleased to find TruSkin&#x27;s 20% Vitamin C product which was already combined with Hyaluronic Acid. One less step and greater percentage of Vitamin C,  and lower price, I was eager to try it out. I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks now and have seen a noticeable improvement in my skin! I attended a party yesterday and saw former co-workers who all raved how youthful and great my skin looked and how &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t changed at all in 20 years!&amp;#34;  I absolutely recommend this superior serum and plan to continue to use other products by TruSkin!</li>
    <li> After the first evening application of vitamin C serum I could FEEL the difference but the next morning I could SEE the difference. My skin looked softer, brighter, &amp; smoother. It&#x27;s been 3 days and I love the way my skin looks &amp; feels so I ordered one of every product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a lifetime customer now!</li>
    <li> Its add smoothness to my face but I feel that one tiny drop is enough.  This is not equivalent to a month.  Must get 2 bottles to last.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin in less than 2 weeks. Also the customer service is top notch. I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought it because I had seen on WebMD.com that vitamin C has shown anti-aging benefits, and this was the most reasonably priced product along these lines that I had found. Not only does the product cause my skin to feel &#x27;tighter&#x27; but I have gotten compliments on how nice my skin looks lately. I also have been on prescription acne medication and have not had to use it nearly as much since starting this product and have not used my prescription in two weeks with absolutely no break-outs. The customer service was awesome, and I will definitely be using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ll write an additional review once I&#x27;ve used it a while longer.    December 22,2014  Ok so I absolutely love this product. My skin is so much softer and very clear. I&#x27;ve also started to use it on stretch marks and they seem to be more faint! The customer service from Erica is impeccable! I would definitely purchase and recommend this vitamin c serum! It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for  four weeks and I have to say that this is a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;I am a 67 year- old Japanese house wife but have super oily skin which is not good for this Florida hot and humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was always greasy, but after I started this vitamin C serum my skin is clean and mat all day long.&lt;br /&gt;My pores have tighten and skin tones are even, brown spots are fading.&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum with a prescribed tretenoin for about 3 weeks now and I am amazed by the results. I suffer from acne, and the Rx prescribed really dried up my skin. The vitamin C serum has hydrated it and kept me from further breakouts. I&#x27;m 40, so new acne and brown spots from old acne were my main concerns for seeking out a new skin regimen. I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised with my results and will continue to use the vitamin C serum. My skin looks amazing! The company is very hospitable as well. Delivery was prompt. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> My skin feels soft and tight. I have been using it for two weeks  it take a while that you can see it diffrence . I do have couple dark spots I have putting extra on it hoping they will fade bit we will see it just to soon to see it .</li>
    <li> havent noticed any difference-didnt last long-even when using a drop daily.</li>
    <li> A high quality product from a trustworthy company that provides excellent customer care. I didn&#x27;t buy this serum with huge expectations however I was really surprised.. applied to my face and neck twice daily between my toner and moisturizer, I found a significant increase in the brightness and suppleness of my face and neck. Immediately after application softness is noticeably increased. I&#x27;m writing this review now because I have become a repeat customer. There really are very few serums out there that are of this quality and effectiveness for this price. Even then it still exceeds many expensive serums who can&#x27;t provide a formula that is so easily absorbed with instant results. I really recommend this especially for anyone who has not yet begun using a serum in their daily routine.</li>
    <li> Really nice product.  After having a facial (birthday present from my daughter) I wanted to continue with Vitamin C serum.  As my daughter joined me in a facial I will give her some of this serum for her birthday.  Leaves a very smooth and soft feel to your face</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting like so many other Vit C serums.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly and completely. I have already noticed that my complexion is brighter and my pores less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt; I’ll definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I just received this serum about a week ago, and I have already noticed results.  I don&#x27;t have any acne or scarring, but sometimes my complexion doesn&#x27;t have the brightness that I want it to, and this stuff really gives me a nice glow! :) I&#x27;ve also noticed that my face feels tighter and more firm, so I think it&#x27;s good for aging as well.  I&#x27;m in my 20s... so I figure if I start using this now, I will age really slowly. :P</li>
    <li> This product is a must have. About 2 weeks into using the Vitamin C serum once a day, People started telling me my complexion looks great. They have asked me what I have been doing different, and I told them about this serum. Vitamin C really is amazing!</li>
    <li> You will notice the difference almost immediately as your skin is soft and absolutely glowing.  Customer service is outstanding and I will definitely be ordering again. My friends and family have all commented that I look great, or that I look much younger.  Simply a must-have product.</li>
    <li> I think this stuff will work but it smells spoiled. Is that just the way it is supposed to smell?</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product is awesome. Even in the short time I have been using it twice a day, my skin feels and looks terrific. The addition of the Hyaluronic Acid plumps up my skin and creates a smooth base for my sunscreen and foundation. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> Desperately wanted to like this and I was hoping it would work. I haven&#x27;t broken out it a long time but I was left with a lot of acne marks from past breakouts, so I wanted to use this to help lighten them faster. However, within 2 days of using this, I have 4 massive pimples on my face (which never happens, usually I get tiny pimples if anything) that are proving to be tough to get rid of. :( I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Brighter complexion. Lightens my acne and hyperpigtension and scratches or cut to my face and neck. Excellent product and lighten my dark under eye circles. But you must use twice everyday . And you see fast results in a matter of days not even a week. I love this!</li>
    <li> Was really hoping this product would work..even just a little due to the many praises from people I personally know. Sadly, nothing! I actually noticed more breakouts within the first week of using :( needless to say..disappointed.</li>
    <li> I just bought this a few weeks ago and have been using it for about a week now and have totally seen a difference in my face. It looks radiant and has a beautiful youthful glow. I use it with the Truskin retinol 2.5 and i love the combo :) im glad i purchased. Im only 34 amd the dull skin and fine lines were creeping up and thanks to this product its a big difference in only a week!</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job and I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed any results with this product after 1 month of use.  No difference in my skin what so ever.</li>
    <li> I love this product have been using it for a week and people are already seeing results on the mini fine lines and ask what I&#x27;m using that my mom even wants to try it. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is more a review of the company TruSkin Naturals, rather than the product itself. Kudos to them, I will definitely be making more skin care purchases from TruSkin and thanks to Erica for the great customer service.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this product I did my homework.  TruSkin Naturals came out on top for three reasons:  It contains the most stable form of Vit C (Sodium Ascorbl Phosphate), the list of ingredients contains Aloe -something I have always felt is magical with its healing properties, and this is MADE IN THE USA.  What more could you want?  After using this product for three weeks, I am already seeing results - especially the under-eye area.  I will definitely continue to purchase this product!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to take some time and really test the product before giving a review. I really love the product I apply it twice a day and can feel the difference eventhough I&#x27;m using it for 15 days only. I&#x27;m 33 years old and starting to have whinkles around my eyes. Now that I massage bellow my eyes with the serum my skin started to get clearer in there which encouraged me to put it all over my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are doing a great job! and I guarantee you I&#x27;m going to reorder this exact same product as soon as it&#x27;s almost finished.</li>
    <li> I love it ! I will definitely be a returning customer !!! Been flying a lot and also had some hyper pigmentation removed and this was truly a godsend !!!</li>
    <li> This serum is great!!  It&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave any type of greasy film as some products do.  I have sensitive skin and the serum didn&#x27;t break me out or give me any rashes, etc..  It absorbs right into my skin, leaving it extra soft.  The customer service is great too!!  I received emails letting me know the product had shipped, giving instructions on how to use the product with other products, follow-up, and the list goes on.  They also give a 50% off coupon on your next order.  Great service all around the board!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally an optimist when trying new skin products, only to be let down. I have dry, sensitive skin which is a hassle to deal with living in the desert. I have been using this product for about a month and a half now and I have to say I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed better retention of my moisturizer when applying it morning and evening. But the best part is that my skin LOOKS better. I had a baby 4 months ago and my skin was awful. I had so many acne scars which have all but faded away now.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m giving this product a 5 star review for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Customer service is amazing. They email you about how to use the product and how you feel about it. Meaning they care about your satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;2. The product works. I started off once a day to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic for a couple of weeks and then moved it to twice a day. I can&#x27;t lie about my results. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy anymore  because I&#x27;m using less moisturizer and my mom (a harsh critic of mine) even said how flowy my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;3. You can&#x27;t beat the price. You could easily spend a whole lot more on a similar product, but why waste your money when you could have this?!</li>
    <li> The product is great and the seller is wonderful and a pleasure to work with!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in Colorado for 2 weeks and have been able to use this to keep my skin clear and looking great.  I have tried many other Vitamin C serums, and wanted to try this Organic product.  I have been very pleased with the product so far.  It is certainly a great value in comparison to other Vitamin C serums.  I highly recommend this product.  I also want to note that unlike other sellers on Amazon, TruSkin has wonderful customer service.  They believe in their products and want their customers to be satisfied!</li>
    <li> thanks so much i really love it and i will buy it again</li>
    <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS STUFF! I WAS SURPRISED IT WORKS SO WELL.</li>
    <li> I think the serum works very well and am happy about my purchase. My skin has a smoother texture and for the price, I feel like it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> One of the best I have ever used. Very nice texture.</li>
    <li> My skin is  82 yrs old,  fragile and thin. This product has improved the health and conditions of my skin. The follow up by the producer and response to my questions was great. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. I have not seen a difference with daily use.</li>
    <li> I have been using the TruSkin Vitamin C and TruSkin Retinol serum combined with my favorite all organic moisturizer - the Face Cream by Belle Aglaia (www.belleaglaia.com) every day for a week so far. Without telling my good friend - a licensed beautician - about my newly discovered skin care recipe, she immediately noticed the overall improvement of my skin. I am truly impressed myself and excited that my face looks radiant and glowing, my skin is super smooth and soft, deeply moisturized, pores are visibly smaller ... I would even say that my wrinkles have been smoothed out ... as if time and the signs of aging have been turning back! I love the combination of these products, as they really work together for visible results!</li>
    <li> I love the serum, my skin is so much smoother, I have noticed a difference In my appearance , I will continue to use this remarkable product, It only takes a small amount to apply at one time,  thank you so much for this vitamin C serum wonder.</li>
    <li> Seems to be making my skin smoother!!</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping.  I am going to give it a few months, then I will review it again.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  However, it is too early to tell how well it is going to work long term.</li>
    <li> I love the difference in my skin and the glow my skin has from using this product. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> It is just only a week I bought this product and it is too early to say. I know Vit C when you apply to your face you will feel tingling means to say it is concentration of the element but it did not. I will continue to use it and come back after a month for another review.</li>
    <li> I was given this by a blogger friend to test and give a review for her blog.  (BTW - great way to try out new products without having to buy them!)  Hyaluronic Acid will plump up the top layers of your skin for immediate results, but know that it does not make a long term difference - you have to keep using it to get those results.  Vitamin C is a little different, it is a building block for healthy skin and connective tissue and it will help in the longer term.  HOWEVER.  No matter what any company says, Vitamin C is not stable and it should be refrigerated.  So many companies making these products say to store at room temperature, but not true.  Keep it in the fridge, you will get better results.  The jury is out as to how well topical Vitamin C is absorbed by the skin, but if you get nice results (I did!) then the skin can absorb at least enough to make a difference.    Tips:  More is not necessarily better.  I tried it two ways - putting a lot on in the morning, once a day, and then less morning and night, twice a day.  The twice a day did better, and the once a day using a lot left my skin a tad sticky.  My recommendation is apply a few drops at a time until you cover face, neck, etc. that you want to treat.  Another tip: I also use it on my hands.  I am starting to get discoloration spots on my hands, and this has helped lessen them.    When I test products for my blogger friend, I first try the product all by itself to see what results it gives alone. I can say that this product gave decent results.  I then use products with my regular routine and see how it works together.  That&#x27;s when I saw amazing results.  I use[[ASIN:B007VEPVZC Bel Essence - (2oz) 100% All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]] daily, it&#x27;s all natural and organic, vegan, etc. The Bel Essence oil has more vitamins, omega 3&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s, fatty acids, that are the building blocks for collagen and skin cells.  When you add the Vitamin C, it&#x27;s almostlike giving your skin the complete food pyramid.    Results with the two products are fabulous.  Within a month, my skin was smoother, firmer, skin tone was more even, dark spots lighter, and most of all my skin was hydrated and soft ALL DAY.  Elbows aren&#x27;t scaly and dry, the fine lines on my face are gone, the heavier lines on my forehead and on the sides of my mouth are shorter, not as deep and barely noticeable and the dark circles under my eyes are even lighter.  The Bel Essence alone gave me great results, the Vitamin C Serum gave me good results, but the two together are really powerful.    Note:  It takes a minute for the Vitamin C to be absorbed in your skin, and the oil also takes a minute to absorb.  I put the oil on first after my shower (am and pm) when my skin is warm and dry and it absorbs faster.  Then I put the Vitamin C on - this order seems to take the least time to absorb. I can say though, even waiting a couple of minutes for the products to be absorbed - definitely worth it.  (The Bel Essence also comes in a cream if you prefer creams).  I&#x27;ve always been complimented about my skin - you have a nice glow!  your skin is so nice! - but I&#x27;ve been getting more compliments since I started using both products.  Highly recommend both.</li>
    <li> I love the Serum.  My skin looks brighter.</li>
    <li> Overall I think this product work well together with the truskin retinol. I feel the two go hand in hand and you will see better results. I have noticed diminished laugh line wrinkles and my complexion does look brighter with a glow. I used it at night before bed with the truskin retinol and then a night moisturizer. Woke up  to a vibrant complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products to &amp;#34;improve my skin&amp;#34; but this one really works. The price is so reasonable that I use it not only on my face and neck, but also on the back of my hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  I use it a lot; maybe too much (morning and night).  I do see the difference in my skin since I started using it.  My skin feels a bit tighter and I see less lines since.  I do use other products with it, like retinol and collagen.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my second week using this serum and the I&#x27;m in love with the results my pores look clean and dark spots are desapering..love it.</li>
    <li> I havent seen the result yet because I just used it once a day. But the 1st day I got it, i used tiwce a day and I break out a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let see how its going in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Item as described, prompt shipping, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I read most of the 5 stars and 1 star reviews and decided I have nothing to lose since I saw the money back guarantee &amp; my other account has Prime shipping.  The morning after I first applied this serum, I was shocked as to how clear and amazing my face looked. I was glowing &amp; repetitively asked my husband if he also noticed a difference. He too, saw the difference in my skins clarity. I am 28 and still have acne here and there, and am still left with acne scars. I hoped this was the answer to my prayers, as I have tried everything from proactiv to philosophy... I&#x27;m still applying this every night but I haven&#x27;t seen the same results like the ones I saw from the first morning of usage. It has been 1 week but I will not give up because of that first morning when I thought it was a miracle. I will try to update after I use up my bottle to see if it has saved my skin or not.</li>
    <li> Smoother skin and dark spots are fading away!!  I haven&#x27;t had that &amp;#34;one pimple pop-up&amp;#34; once a month which I have been battling for decades...I&#x27;m almost 50, so its about time the acne has disappeared.  My neck and chest are less turkey looking, too!!!  Finally, I&#x27;ve found something that really works after spending $Ks on microdermabrasion, a clarisonic brush, a Tanda light, a Tria light and several expensive facial systems over the years.  Thank goodness for this serum!!  All I do now is drink lots of water and green tea, cleanse my face with CeraVe cleanser, apply Truskin C, E + Hyaluronic Acid serum (morning and evening), apply CeraVe lotion, apply a sunscreen, and take a phytoceramide capsule each day.  Keeping it simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is I&#x27;ve been able to stop using daily foundation to mask my problem skin....using just a stick concealer on the spots (that are fading away) and powder when I want a polished look.  My skin is also not as oily on my T-zone area when I don&#x27;t use concealer/powder.  I hope to stop using the concealer stick soon at this rate.  I always use sunglasses and do wear a hat to protect my skin and hair when outside for long periods.  Both my daughter and husband have noticed the difference in my skin.  My first bottle lasted two months.  I start my second TruSkin bottle today. :)  I am extremely pleased with this product and its cost!!!!  It also has reduced my overall facial regime time and cost.  Buy it and try it!!!</li>
    <li> Just received it. May I say what great follow up the seller has as she has followed up with me to insure receipt and inquire if I have any questions. She has even offered to instruct me in the use, but the instructions on the bottle are clear and easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid goes on easy, non greasy and light. You can easily wear under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand from independent studies that vitamin C in this form has been shown to increase fine lines and improve collagen production, which is why I chose this brand. I will update my use of the product periodically to advise if I see noticeable improvement but I must say I am already impressed with the service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 4/21/15 - As promised, I agreed to update my review at the end of the use of one bottle. I must qualify this is a nice product which does not make any representations as to it&#x27;s effectiveness. However, I purchased as I read a study which supported Vitamin C in this form assists with collagen reproduction, etc. I purchased to see if it improved my skin texture. Alas, unfortunately it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works nicely as a moisturizer, but I also use my regular moisturizer over it so cannot fully determine it&#x27;s stand alone use as a moisturizer. Given the price, I can&#x27;t recommend it&#x27;s use soley as a moisturizer. I will not be repurchasing given the price, which is a bit high and it doesn&#x27;t suit my needs.</li>
    <li> I like the product it works well on my skin. I also use TruSkin Retinol serum both products are nice and light for the face, neck and on the top of your hands before bed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Makes skin look instantly younger and improves with continued use. My skin has never looked so good. Only issue is if you put it on too thick under makeup it will look scaley but if you use it sparingly you are fine</li>
    <li> The vitamin c serum seems to be improving the quality of my skin.  It looks brighter and more even-looking.  Some dark marks I have from past blemishes have lightened and the redness around my nose has diminished a bit.  I will definitely keep using it to further improve my skin!</li>
    <li> Love the Vitamin C Serum - Skin looks brighter , with some improvement in brown age spots on left side of face. I put serum on left hand before applying to face and neck, now left hand looks smoother than right hand - will have to start applying FROM my right hand now. LoL - ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> Love it! My face looks brighter!</li>
    <li> caused me to break out. BAD</li>
    <li> I am giving this product a 5 star rating because of the great customer service (Erica is amazing) and because the serum gives skin the glowing and radiant look it needed (especially during winter). I started to see results after 3 weeks of daily use(morning and night). At first I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my skin condition as I have mild acne around my chin and I was not using it daily, but Erica offered to send me a new bottle to continue using it for an extended trial, and I now I really glad that I did. The skin on my chin looks so much better and the brown spots started to disappear. I will continue using this product and even try using it on my hands.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 2 weeks now and it DEFINITELY makes a difference. I have smoother, tighter looking skin. It works great. However, applied slightly liberally (not excessively) about the face, shoulders and neck, I&#x27;ve already used almost half the bottle. The price seems a little ridiculous for how little you get. I&#x27;m not sure I can justify buying a new bottle every 3-4 weeks. But it does work and I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well on by face.  after 3 weeks if can tell that my skin has tightened an much softer.  In following the directions, I put on the toner, then the serum, and then a very light moisturizer before bed time.  I am ready to order another bottle and would appear to be a very environmentally efficient application for my skin.</li>
    <li> The serum is working wonderfully for me. I&#x27;ve been seeing a little difference in my skin after using it. My dark spots are not as visible as they use to be. I have no complaints about the serum, I think it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Just start using......hoping for good results....It feels good......I&#x27;m 72....any little safe help I can get is nice....!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and customer service great SD usual.</li>
    <li> Great product, I would buy again</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few weeks now and I already notice a difference!  Smoother, more even skin tone and a small reduction in wrinkles, especially on my forehead.  It&#x27;s a subtle difference, but at 59 years old, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> This serum is kind of silky going on.  Vitamin C does facilitate cell health and regeneration , especially when used along with Vitamin A serum.</li>
    <li> I have used the Vitamin C Serum and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I have combination skin with slightly more oily T Zone areas.  I have been product hopping for some time but find even the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; versions of products to still be pore clogging.  I dont think it is so much the products fault but has to do with how my skin works with those products. These two products from TrueSkin work amazingly with my skin and I love it.  My only concern is, when I do find a product that my skin loves the company either changes the recipe/ingredients or they get bought out by a huge conglomerate and the product changes to make it cheaper.  PLEASE DON&#x27;T LET THIS HAPPEN!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product and fantastic company and will definitely buy from again. Soon after purchase I received an update email from company. I responded and answered a couple questions regarding my usage of their product. NOT a sales pitch. I told them how much I really loved their product, they then asked me since I loved the one product I bought if I was interested in trying a different product of theirs with their compliments.  The first product is working so well of course I took them up on the offer.&lt;br /&gt;I have no affiliation to this company I am how ever a person that have a very, VERY difficult time finding products that work with my skin and this product does and I want to let people know.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus is being able to communicate with the company directly.  Fantastic communication. I wish all companies had their etiquette and customer service.</li>
    <li> GREAT product! My skin looks healthier and it smooths out fine lines.</li>
    <li> So far this is amazing! I&#x27;ve noticed some wrinkles lately and have some discoloration on my neck, probably from sun damage. After only using this product for a few days I already see a slight difference!! I&#x27;m hoping with prolonged use I&#x27;ll see a big difference. By the other reviews, and by what I&#x27;ve seen after only using for a few days, I&#x27;m extremely hopeful!! My skin looks more youthful and bright as well :).. I also switched to a coconut water facial cleanser. I am loving the way my skin is responding to these 2 products already!!</li>
    <li> Very effective:) minimizes my dark spots in just a few applications.</li>
    <li> I have been using Truskin Natural Vit C serum for two weeks. Honestly after a few days my skin felt smoother, tighter and has a healthy glow!&lt;br /&gt;I am 50 and have tried many different products. This is by far the best I have tried. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought this serum for my wife she loves it and use a little which goes a long way she says, she uses it every night. She saw this on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I have been using it for only two weeks and already see results!  At the airport in Dallas a stranger asked me what I use to keep my skin so pretty!  Naturally I recommended it !</li>
    <li> This really works! my pours were sooo big and a few weeks later you can hardly tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy another one!</li>
    <li> The most absolutely amazing skin care product ever !  Yeah that&#x27;s a big claim, let me explain...  First, without even mentioning what its sold for, I have had a fairly prominent scar on my nose from a squamous cell removal for the past 12 years.  I have tried every possible scar cream, home microdermabrasion, retinol, . hyaluronic acid, botanical this and that with zero results.  In ONLY 4 days this once prominent scar had been reduced from being noticeable at 6 feet away to the point of being barely even visible at 6&amp;#34; away. I would not have believed it in a million years if it did not just happen .  In that same short time it has reduced wrinkles all over my face.  I mean it REALLY reduced them to the point where you can notice it...  Not like every other miracle cream out there that actually does NOTHING even perceivable to me.  I can not say if every other C serum out there would have done the same.  There are several coming out now ...  but this one is worth it&#x27;s weight in skin care gold !</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. it&#x27;s silky to the touch and very easy to apply. I think the key is to use it day and night. To test the product, I started using it in the areas around my eyes (mostly the crows feet). I didn&#x27;t notice a change the first week, but by the second week the crows feet had minimized so much, I thought the had disappeared. Now, I&#x27;m using it in around my nose, mouth and neckline. In a very short time, there has been a distinct softening of the laugh lines around my nose and mouth! This is an awesome product that works! I think that says it all!</li>
    <li> I love this product--I genuinely look forward to putting it on in the morning. It makes my skin feel fresh and new. I can see the difference it has made in my skin&#x27;s appearance over 1 month, and I am already on my 3rd bottle and trying to get my mother to use it. I use it in the morning underneath my lotion. At night I wear Tretinoin and Alpha Hydroxy lotion. I think this combination works wonders.</li>
    <li> i just got this product and i haven&#x27;t used it fully, but so far i love it. makes my skin feel great instantly. not thick, oily or greasy. has no smell, most vita C products smell citrus, which i dont mind.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin softer, notice less wrinkles.  Have been using for 2 weeks, morning and eve under my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. My tired looking skin (I&#x27;m 46) needed a pick me up and this is it. I use it in the morning after cleansing and also again before bed. I just recommended this to a friend today. Give this serum a try if your looking for something to smooth out the fine lines and restore some brightness to a tired, dull complexion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and I am happy with the results. My skin seems brighter and more even toned. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any change in my face since this is the first time I applied this serum. However, when I apply the serum, and then the olay moisturizer. My face smells really bad for some reason, and it gives me a headache. I tried to apply the serum on one hand, and the moisturizer on the other, both smells fine. But for some reason, when they put together,it smells really bad. Guess I have to change either the serum or the moisturizer. Update: I just asked my bro, the smell is come from the serum the most. Is it suppose to have some kind of bad smell? New Update 6/10/2015 After I wrote the review about the smell, the company send me a new bottle of the serum. The new one I received works perfectly fine and does not have the bad smell as the last one. It making my skin really soft and I really like it. Usually, I have the type of skin that almost nothing can put on it because my skin is super sensitive, but this one works perfectly fine, didn’t cause any irritation. I really like the result from it.</li>
    <li> Best after sale service ever! Very impressive!</li>
    <li> I used the product for 1 month now twice a day, following the instructions but see no difference in my skin. I could have stayed with water and soap, Consistency, application and packaging are ok.</li>
    <li> I am a non believer that serums etc can help in fading spots, soften fine lines and lesson the appearance of wrinkles. However, I stumbled across articles on vitamin c and their benefits on your skin, and decided to give it a try . I can honestly say in the 3 weeks I have faithfully used trueskinC, I am very impressed with not only the results I am seeing, but also the softness and healthy look of my face. I just ordered 3 more bottles , I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I like the serum, makes my skin look really smooth</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product,  After only two weeks I can see noticeable improvement in my skin.  The brown spots from sun damage are fading &amp; my skin feels  smoother &amp; firmer.  I use this serum in the morning under my moisturizer containing SPF 30 &amp; again at night under my night cream.  I will continue ordering.  I know my skin will only keep getting better &amp; better.  Also, love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural with no parabens or artificial anything.  Great product, great price,  great company, great customer service!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving it so far. People have come up to me and asked what is my secret to getting my skin so toned and radiant? Without hesitation I informed them of your product. Please keep selling this product  ... as I will be a customer for life! Thank you so much for a great investment.</li>
    <li> I literally began to see a difference a couple days after using this product. My skin is smoother and softer and I have smaller pores. I am still working on the wrinkles and bags around my eyes as it has not even been 2 weeks since using this product but I am seeing a great improvement in my overall skin texture and appearance. I will be trying their retinol serum soon.</li>
    <li> My skin feels good and I love the serum!</li>
    <li> Yes. I am happy with the TruSkin naturals. My face feels smooth and looks clear and vibrant. I need to order more soon!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product. Softens my skin, great humectant for my aging skin. Noticeable difference on first application. Economic price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now.  I use it nightly after washing my face or showering before bed, moisturizing after the serum dries. I apply it to my face and down my neck. I originally purchased this because I felt like my skin regiment needed a boost.  My skin was looking dull and the texture just  wasn&#x27;t great.  On top of all that, I am pregnant, and though many people speak of the lovely &amp;#34;pregnancy glow&amp;#34; I was starting to feel like the hormones of pregnancy were wreaking havoc on my skin instead of helping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin that tends to develop dry patches if I apply too much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; to it, so I try to minimize my skin care routine to quality products.  After two weeks of using TruSkin Vitamin C serum, my skin started to fell SO MUCH smoother in texture.  Then, last week I started to notice a more even skin tone and less break outs. Overall, my skin looks and feels much healthier after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m seeing wonderful results.&lt;br /&gt;*It feels great going on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s natural and organic AND not tested on animals (another must in my skin care regiment!)&lt;br /&gt;*No strong smells of chemicals, additives, and perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;*MADE IN THE U.S.A!!  Yay!  &#x27;Merica!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;*Great customer service!  Even though I ordered this product on Amazon, I was emailed by a company representative with extra information about the product, how to use it, and results that I should look for once I use the product for a bit.  They left contact information in case I should have extra questions because they really wanted me to get the most from the product and like my purchase.  A few weeks later I got a follow up email, just checking to see how the product was working for me.  They also have a TruValue program for frequent buyers....I will be looking into this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend adding this product to your skin care routine!</li>
    <li> The TruSkin Naturals Serum is a wonderfully amazing product. The serum has my skin looking as if I&#x27;m wearing makeup. It has such a glow and shine. It&#x27;s not  an oily look.  I&#x27;ve been asked what makeup I use, I tell them none.  TruSkin Naturals is the &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m in my 40s and look like I&#x27;m in my 30s.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase more TruSkin Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does not allow for 10 Stars; however, that&#x27;s is what TruSkin deserves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making such a superior product.</li>
    <li> I have been faithful Amozon shopper for years and this is on of the first reviews I have given. I was out of my old natural Vit C product and wanted on just a natural but s bit more effective. I was very hesitant to try this one but coukd not get over the amount of positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is wonderful. Replaces my old vitamin C product. It&#x27;s easy to use and my skin is smooth, pours ar smaller, and helps keep the acne away.  I love the slight tingling sensation as I know the Vitamin C is actually performing! &lt;br /&gt;Truly all the reviews were correct...this is a wonderful,  all natural, afordable product that has become a must have to my daily regime!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the costomer service is OUT OF THIS WORLD! The personal care that is taken for the cares of the costomer, and the amazing results makes one proud to remain a faithful costomer!!!</li>
    <li> I actually am quite pleased with the Vitamin C TruSkin Natural product!  I have noticeable difference in the lines on my neck.  I will be reordering, soon... Thank you, Appreciative in Seattle!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this about a month, but the results are dramatic.  I have tried other Vitamin C Serums of the same or more cost, but find that TruSkin gives the best results for the money.  My pores are smaller and my acne scars seem smoother.  The overall appearance of my skin is dewier and tighter.  This 59 year old has found her new favorite!</li>
    <li> I love the serum.  I especially like that it works well with my oily, aging skin as I feel it&#x27;s hard to find an age defying product that doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I also appreciate the suppliers follow up ensuring I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  Great product and great company!</li>
    <li> I really like it, the consistency of the serum Is nice and thick, your skin just drinks it up! Its not runny like most serum&#x27;s. So far My results are looking good and I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for nearly two weeks now. It&#x27;s really a wonderful product.  It has evened out my skin &amp; taken away the puffiness around my eyes.  My only concern is that since my daughter also started to use it, it goes quickly!  We&#x27;ll be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> Excellent feel going on, gives a nice even glow to my face. My skin is very sensitive and picky about its response to new products. Both my skin and I like serum and use it every night with no problems.</li>
    <li> every lady over 50 needs this</li>
    <li> It may be my oversensitive skin, but this serum causes my skin to peel like crazy.  I had to stop using it as it looks pretty bad.  I&#x27;m going back to the completely over-priced SkinCeuticals CE Fleuric.  :(</li>
    <li> Love this serum so much I bought another😁</li>
    <li> This is a great product i noticed a big difference within my facial appearance must have product</li>
    <li> So far it has helped with the healing of my adult acne scars.  I&#x27;m currently using your product every day.</li>
    <li> It feels sticky and it makes my face feel drier than normal.  You have to use more than a couple of drops if you want to cover your entire face.  I thought it was going to provide a little moisture.  I don&#x27;t know if it does what it claims since I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  Since I don&#x27;t like the way it feels, I&#x27;m only going to use it around my eyes and upper lip to see if it reduces the appearance of fine lines.</li>
    <li> I love the product and am using it to supplement my Rodan and Fields Reverse system. I like the consistency of the product and the applicator is great!-thanks:-)</li>
    <li> Awesome!! I saw the change within a week of using this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over month and found that it seems to really make a difference on my fine lines. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love the serum!! It does seem to revitalize the skin overnight!&lt;br /&gt;I believe you guys are doing a great job!</li>
    <li> This feels good on the face, otherwise I can&#x27;t really say much about it, have seen no results as yet, been using it two weeks.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try it and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I finished one bottle and within 1 1/2-2 weeks, I noticed a difference on the lines on my forehead.  I use it in the morning and at night. After it dries on my face, I add a moisturizer to my face and it seems to be working really well together. I already ordered a second bottle and will continue to use this instead of going to get botox injections.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for about 2 weeks now.  I bought this mainly for preventative wrinkle treatment. So far really love it. Great customer service as well!</li>
    <li> I am starting to notice a difference in my skin already. Luckily I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles yet.  I have started to notice changes in the skin around my neck. It&#x27;s helping with that and the acne and age spots on my face are slowly beginning to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and their customer service. I will certainly reorder.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction. Excellent product. As described. Arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! I have very bad Acne scars and I&#x27;ve been using many project such as; lush, clean and clear, spot treatments, but this is by far the BEST product for acne scaring. I use this everynight. This will be my 3rd bottle. One bottle last me a month, I tend to use it a lot. :) but like I said it&#x27;s amazing for Acne scaring.   PLUS! I would love to give a shoutout to truSKin customer service, ERIKA! She&#x27;s super nice and its replies right away to my messages when I have questions about each product.   5 stars - the vitamin C  &amp; 5 stars for ERICA :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin at all. Its a nice serum though.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and in appropriate sized box when shipped. Love this serum,and the vitamin E is a great addition. Will order this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Vitamin C Serum. My skin looks better everyday.  I will continue to purchase the serum. Thanks for making a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately had a two-week stay in the hospital and major surgery when I would rather have been home trying out my new serum.  Since being home, I have been using the serum twice-daily after washing my face.  I love the way my skin feels, and people are telling me they can&#x27;t believe I just went through this huge physical ordeal because I look great.  Must be the serum.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised. The dark spots seem to be getting lighter. I have recommended this product to some&lt;br /&gt;of my friends whom notice a difference in my complexion. Its been about three weeks.  I hope this process will&lt;br /&gt;continue.  Due to the harsh sun; the dark spots is of a concern to me and I use SPF too.  I have tried other Vitamin C but&lt;br /&gt;this does  have a more positive effective on my skin.  :)</li>
    <li> I do like the serum. It does not leave a sticky residue like prior serums I have used.  I am starting to notice that a difference around my eyes which was primarily the reason I purchased it so yes I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My friends always ask me what I use on my skin. They can&#x27;t believe this is my secret. My skin has an amazing glow that women spend so much time and money on.  This product is by far better then anything I have ever purchased and the customer service is out standing!</li>
    <li> I can see a difference in my skin from using this product.</li>
    <li> Removed a terrible brown patch on my face after three applications!</li>
    <li> I am definitely seeing a difference in my skin, and will continue using the product.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the fact that it only takes a few drops, and the nice dropper bottle should last for quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more when it runs out, as it is the most reasonably priced serum out there!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a month to two months and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. I still have fine lines.</li>
    <li> I love the serum.  I use it every day but apparently I use too much as I am low on stock.  I use it on my face, hands, and neck and it has made a big difference.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it feels good on my face.  I like that the ingredients are safe which is my main concern.  I&#x27;ve only been using for about a week, but already it seems that I can see a difference in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Just started, don&#x27;t know the result yet.</li>
    <li> Did I see a difference in my skin after using TruSkin Naturals Organic Vitamin C Serum? YES! After 3 weeks of using this product I saw an amazing difference in my skin and I am old, very old. I did not think this serum would work for me especially at my age, but actually my skin is looking better each day. What am I doing additionally?  I drink plenty of water continually flushing my system and I take Vitamin C internally and I use TruSkin Naturals Organic Vitamin C Serum topically, because I believe it is important to treat your body internally as well as externally when ever possible.  Additionally, I never thought my pores were a problem, but after using TruSkin Naturals Organic Vitamin C Serum my pores began looking better, and my skin looks tighter and smoother and my dark spots are gradually fading.  Having said all this, it is most important to say, always consult with your Doctor before making any changes to your daily regiment of any kind; therefore, always make sure to get your doctors approval first! Especially with knowing that, what works for other people may not be in your best interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! I forgot to say after washing my face and neck, I gently splash Witch Hazel on face and wipe dry with cotton ball before applying TruSkin Naturals Organic Vitamin C Serum topically and after that dries I use a Vitamin C Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the serum. I have very sensitive skin and it did not break me out. I have been using it for the past 2 weeks and yes I am seeing an improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much and keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok, could not tell it did anything for me</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It makes small skin tags disappear!</li>
    <li> This product has been amazing so far.  I have only been using this product for about a month, and there have been dramatic differences in my skin.  My fine lines are disappearing, my skin looks brighter.  My co-workers noticed right away.  I am very happy with this product because it does work.</li>
    <li> So far the serum works great I apply right after I shower. I have combination skin so it&#x27;s easy for me to have break outs. It&#x27;s been clearing up my face and gives it a nice glow.  I notice it also acts as a protective barrier and works well with my moisturizer.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural and is not a harsh chemical.  Thank you for such a great product I will continue to buy in the future!</li>
    <li> This product continues to be amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and notice the difference.  Even better is that I&#x27;ve been approached by two complete strangers that said my skin was gorgeous and glowing.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I was to receive this product.  I could hardly wait to begin seeing the results so many reviews gave it.  Well, after using it two weeks, I saw nothing, but I knew it might be too soon to see any visible results.  I&#x27;ve used this product faithfully for four (4) weeks now and still see no results at all.  As a matter of fact, it&#x27;s very sappy and dry to the touch and if it weren&#x27;t for applying my moisturizer over it, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stand the way it feels on my skin.  I&#x27;m so disappointed; not that I spent the money, but that I was willing to AGAIN spend money on a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mother and myself. I must say that it has surpassed both of our expectations. The seller even reached out to me to make sure that I understood the instructions of use. That, I must say, was very professional. I have an extensive background in the field of dermatology. That being said, I don&#x27;t put just any product on my skin. The skin is the largest organ of the body and very susceptible to damage via exposure to the sun and other free radicals. I am beyond impressed by TruSkin Naturals. My skin is more radiant and tighter than before using this Vitamin C Serum. What are you waiting for? Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> First of all I received not only a sweet and profressional email from the seller letting me know my order was on the way. But it also came way before the expected date! I was super impressed! I read the instructions on the serum bottle and put it on after taking a shower. The serum dries very fast after applying it to your face. And I followed it up with a moisturizer. My skin feels soft, but it&#x27;s a smooth and different kind of softness that I&#x27;ve never felt before from any other product. I will update my review after using this a little longer. But for now, I&#x27;m truly impressed:)</li>
    <li> At 55, I finally found my serum! This is different than anything I have ever used before (including high-priced cosmetic counter moisturizers that promised to plump and tone, etc). Its a one-step application that accomplishes so much! It&#x27;s viscous, so it isn&#x27;t too runny, and a little goes a long way. I really like the feel of my skin, ... and no dry patches. I use in the morning and at night under moisturizer. I threw away the other products I had stock-piled. This is all I need.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum and the natural retinol serum for a little over a month. I am satisfied thus far. My skin feels rejuvenated and soft. I&#x27;ve noticed bags under my eyes are visibly minimizing. Although I&#x27;m experiencing a few breakouts, Erica suggested I use the serums a few times a week until my skin adjust to the ingredients. I&#x27;m excited to see more results after continue use of the serums and will be back to rate it a five star.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate their customer service, this company is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve bought from.  They have amazing customer service! I also really love the serum; it&#x27;s only been a few weeks of use and my face feels amazingly soft and I&#x27;m already starting to see a difference in the elasticity of my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and AMAZING company.</li>
    <li> Use this twice a day. I cant speak highly enough about this company and product</li>
    <li> I like the serum because it&#x27;s easy to apply to my skin. With the combination of drinking more water and making sure to wash my face twice a day I do notice there is a glow to my face. Also I noticed that after applying the Retinol and the Vitamin C serum to my face that skin becomes tighten, as for moisturizer I apply a shea butter mixture which has  almond oil and coconut oil.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My skin is glowing after two weeks of use. I use it once a day and the results are outstanding. It evens out skin tone and keeps skin smooth and hydrated. It works on all skin types and is a lovely addition to any skincare routine. I am a minimalist when it comes to products and this functions well as a moisturizer and skin enhancement tool. I would highly recommend TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews but felt I had to review this product because I am very impressed. Most of my life I have had decent skin, but in the last few years my skin has gone downhill - blemishes, dry bumpy skin, some enlarged pores, noticeable wrinkles around my eyes, etc. Like most people, I have tried so many different products to combat the issues but nothing has helped. The dermatologist has prescribed antibiotics, even Retin A, and nothing helped, things even got worse. Then I turned to estheticians for help. Most recently I was recommended an extremely expensive Italian product that is supposed to help sensitive skin. My skin got worse, bumpy and itchy. So discouraging.... Finally, I came across the TruSkin products and read reviews and decided to try it, not expecting much due to my experiences with so many products in the past. Well...it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks and I am in love! I wash my face morning and evening and then pat the serum into my damp skin, followed with moisturizer and eye cream. It feels amazingly smooth going on. My skin is healing!! Blemishes - gone! Redness and bumps - gone! My foundation now goes on smoothly and looks flawless. Not sure about the wrinkles yet because it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks, but I expect great things. I will definitely be purchasing this again and again. Their customer service is fabulous. They check on you to see how the product is working for you. Thank you TruSkin for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I returned this because it has excessive amounts of vitamin c in it.</li>
    <li> So far, I like it a lot. My skin is looking better. I like how the serum spreads so nicely and feels so good. No stickiness.</li>
    <li> I have absolutely loved it so far because it is super light and thus an ideal compliment to my morning &amp; evening skin care products. But even more important, I have seen improvements immediately since beginning the twice a day regimen.  I was looking for a product that would brighten and even my skin tone and now my search is over, this is the perfect serum!  I am sure to be a loyal customer. -Julie</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum since last July and let me just say it is amazing.  I am on my second bottle, and have my aunt hooked on it as well.  I tell everyone about this stuff especially when they find out my age (39), and they tell me how I look so much younger:)  I am very fair and burn easily in the sun so I have to always have SPF on and moisturize.  I use the serum at night and in the morning followed by a gel moisturizer.  I just ordered the Hyaluronic acid serum and am looing forward to integrating that with the regimen. I will use that one at night since it can make your skin more sensitive since it has anti-aging properties followed by moisturizer, and the Vitamin C in the morning.  I try to purchase anything with hyaluronic acid in it.  It is the best thing for one&#x27;s skin especially as we get older and the aging process makes its appearance.  I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with the serum.  I also add a few drops to my everyday moisturizer and mix it in.  Also, TruSkin&#x27;s customer service is the best!  The first time I ordered, after a couple of weeks of having the serum, Erica emailed me to check in and see how I was doing with it and if I had any questions.  I really appreciated that and felt it was very sincere, and not at all pushy.  There are really no cons to trying this out:  Great price, fast shipping, great customer service, helping a small company grow to be the best, and the product is AMAZING.</li>
    <li> I have found that I have a much  healthier, firmer, and less lined facial and neck appearance since using this serum.  I was pleased to share with my daughter who has thought the same.  We have both ordered. It is easy to apply and just feels good.</li>
    <li> I think this serum works great! I have been using it for 2 weeks morning and night and my skin feels softer &amp; looks brighter. I will definitely keep using it &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see what future results I get. I am in my 40&#x27;s and have tried many creams and serums and this seems the most promising!</li>
    <li> I like.... my skin looks smooth and brighter.....</li>
    <li> This serum really helps smooth the skin and leave it feeling very healthy every time it is used.  Price is good.  Glad AMAZON ships fast for re-orders.</li>
    <li> I am in true amazement at the results I am getting after just 2 short weeks of useing TruSkin Naturals. I follow a cleansing process of my face and neck,then I apply each product,useing small circles,then I wait for morning to see what a difference I see every morning. I sleep so comfy knowing that TruSkin Naturals are going to repair my skin to its youthful beauty.you have a great product here.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Carol-Ann Caine</li>
    <li> Ok I guess. Not a miracle product in any way. Used nightly for four months and see no difference. Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the follow up. I like the serum. I like the way it makes my skin look and feel. Definitely saw a difference from the first time u used it. My pores looked smaller and my skin more even toned. I&#x27;d purchase it again. Thinking of purchasing the retinol serum as well.  Thank you so much!!!</li>
    <li> Not bad at all although some of the products purchased were of lesser strength.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife.  Excellent product.  Quick delivery service.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this serum for 3 weeks. I use Retin A at night and have for a while.  I have seen results with the Retin A but I can honestly tell you that I am seeing much better results now with this Vitamin C Serum.  I had two brown spots on the side of my face.....GONE!  Truly they are gone.  I am 63 years old and have aging on my face and the lines are softening.  I hope to see even better results with continued use.  I think I have found my anti aging regiment going forward.  By the way their customer service is great and I am not a fake reviewer as I saw one review claims.  I do not get paid to review from anyone.  Just a customer that is well pleased and after trying tons of lotions and creams, I am happy to share that this one is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue with the night time Retin A and morning Vitamin C serum followed with my moisturizer and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******UPDATE*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C serum continues to work on fading those two brown spots, in&lt;br /&gt;fact I do not believe they can be seen by anyone not knowing that I had&lt;br /&gt;them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is much brighter.....looks alive and not dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin texture is improving and I probably am hoping for miracles, but I&lt;br /&gt;already see a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish that I would have started this serum a long time ago. I will take any&lt;br /&gt;improvement I can get.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT.  I have friends that spend quite a bit of money for their monthly supply.  For less than $20, I have achieved, in my opinion, better results.  The fine lines are disappearing.  The discoloration spots from rosacea are disappearing.  And the age lines from &amp;#34;older skin&amp;#34; around the neck are disappearing.  I have recommended your product and, in fact, have sent a link to several people for them to try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working great! I&#x27;ve noticed that acne scarring (years old) and breakouts (new) are diminished. I&#x27;m 38 and it took me a LONG time to catch on to moisture being the secret weapon to fight breakouts. Other people are noticing too. In fact, I&#x27;ve had someone just this morning who said &amp;#34;your skin looks really good today&amp;#34; with no prompting. She wondered what I was were wearing makeup wise that was different. No makeup difference today, just the same tinted moisterizer/SPF 15 (Physicians Formula) I&#x27;ve been wearing every day for the last year. I been using the Vit C once a day and followup up with coconut oil before bed. Anyone struggle with adult acne, don&#x27;t be afraid of coconut oil.  I still have a lot left in the first bottle of Vit C but want to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out! So, I am ordering way ahead of time.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and light, but didn&#x27;t see any different after finishing the whole bottle though.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used this product for several days, so far it&#x27;s made my skin much softer.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a month and I see no difference whatsoever</li>
    <li> This really helped with my dark skin, I wish I had bought this sooner!!! Great product, a little pricey but worth it</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it daily under my moisturizer. My skin is clearer, healthier and softer. Visible fine lines are gone and age spots are diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> So far, I love how well it blends into my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I have recommended it to family and friends. It’s one of the best products I’ve had the pleasure of using. Unlike other facial products, this doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy residue. I’ve already had people noticing a difference; and it has been wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing and I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! My skin feels great and my wrinkles actually diminished!!!</li>
    <li> My face looks burned from a extreme sun damage from my childhood due to extreme hot conditions where I grew up. After apply for couple weeks it seems it is helping.. My 9year old daughter says that my face looks like a baby&#x27;s butt cheek.. Will update again after few weeks.</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old with dark sun spots on my cheeks and have started using this product about three weeks ago. It is phenomenal. My dark spots have already started to fade significantly and my skin is naturally healthier. I apply it once in the morning and once in the evening. This is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone. I cannot rave about it enough, it has worked wonders!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product!!!  I&#x27;ve had problems with pre-cancer on my face for years and have tried numerous creams and treatments with very little success.... after using Vitamin C serum for just three weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference.  My face is no longer dry &amp; flaky and the brown age spots are even fading 😂  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I really like the serum.  It works better than anything I have used in the past.  I will be buying more after I&#x27;m done with this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the product.  Great Customer Service and Great Company!!!</li>
    <li> I reordered this product because of the excellent results I experienced. It is easily absorbed, doesn&#x27;t feel oily, and appears to really help the usual aging problems with skin (I am 69)..</li>
    <li> Impressive in all aspects.  I have used it for 5 nights now, as an overnight serum, and already see smoother, clearer skin.  It seems to re-texture the surface.  Facial lines, both the superficial ones as well as the deeper kind on the forehead and brow, are actually starting to fade.  Did not expect to see such immediate results. The liquid itself is exceptionally gentle, has a clean, fresh smell, feels weightless, is absorbed upon contact.  Love the handy, sterile eyedropper dispenser.  This is a superior product.  I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> Gave me reaction during my first time of usage but I gave another try and I guess my skin just need to get used to it since it&#x27;s my first time using this kind of product and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> After using since I received it I see no change what so ever, seems like another waste of money.</li>
    <li> Yes I do like your product.  I can tell that it is tightening my skin.  I have really seen a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this. I can tell immediate improvement in my skin. Great value!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on dark spot but It may have worked on a scab.  I&#x27;m not sure</li>
    <li> This is the BEST professional-grade Vitamin C, E and Hyaluronic serum I have EVER used.  I have really, REALLY sensitive skin that I put a LOT of effort into taking care of.  Age 55+. I have wasted $$$ purchasing products that I end up tossing out because they irritate my skin.  There is absolutely NO greasy, icky, texture to this product, as found in most facial serums.  It smoothes on quickly, dries quickly, and the company&#x27;s claim of immediate results, well, it&#x27;s true.  Used twice a day on freshly cleaned face, neck, upper decolletage area and tops of hands, you will be AMAZED.  A few drops is all it takes.  Furthermore, I had an unusual experience regarding my last purchase and delivery.  The customer service department of TruSkin Naturals ROCKS!  Thanks ever so much, ERICA, for your speedy, professional and thoughtful actions!  (And no, I am not a professional reviewer, in fact, I RARELY take the time to review any product; just one happy customer.)</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 5 stars because of the customer service I&#x27;ve experienced (you will get an email letting you know exactly where your product is in transit as well as how to use it once you receive it, and the instructions are so detailed that they include how to use this product if you are using Retinol products), and because of how this product performs. But let me also mention that age is what it is, and the normal process of aging will include the effects we see on faces as they age. If you are using an SPF product, eating right, exercising, and drinking water (and not smoking, which will add years to your skin), then you are already doing a lot for your skin naturally. But, it helps to have a serum that also provides the extra nutrients that will slow the aging process and help reduce the natural appearance of aging. Having said that, let me note that I am 40 and have scar tissue on my face from cystic acne from my early 20s, and I am very specific about my skin regime. I bought this product because of the ingredients as well as the reviews, and I am happy with the results. I also love that this product is reasonably priced, is easy to apply, absorbs nicely, does not have a film or greasy feeling, and has no odor. Again, I do not expect the aging process to be reversed and I would be suspicious of any product that claims to do that, but I can say that this product (as well as the customer service) exceeds my expectations and my skin appears smoother, and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that I love the serum. It&#x27;s been around 2 weeks and my skin feels firmer, fresh and smooth. Even my husband noticed the glow of my skin! The serum has a nice texture and absorbs very quickly. So I&#x27;m not going to buy other expensive serums anymore. I recommend it to all my friends. And I ordered Tru Skin Retinol. I&#x27;m very pleased. Thank you for your care!</li>
    <li> In just a few days, my skin looks better. Happy face and because of it, I am a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Have been using this with another product, and feel it produces the type of results I would expect from a more expensive product. I am pleased with the outcome.</li>
    <li> I like this serum. This is my second bottle, and I bought one for my mom.</li>
    <li> Good product. I&#x27;m already on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> my skin feels very dry after using this product. not visible results after 10 applications.&lt;br /&gt;It seems most of these high rating are fake</li>
    <li> I love the serum so far! Great product, great customer service, great prices....  I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I use it twice a day morning and night. I&amp;#34;ve used slightly better products like this but they were twice the price. This is great for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and customer service!</li>
    <li> Works well - try it on the back of your hands for younger looking skin!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Arrived on time. This product is gentle on my skin and did not cause redness or itching! I will be ordering more and checking out other products available!!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is a good product, I like it! Diane</li>
    <li> I love it! My skin is so soft and my pores look smaller.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since I started to use the serum so I am keeping my fingers crossed that I have found a good product.  I have struggled over my adult life with acne and until now have never found anything that has helped.      I will be reordering again when I run out.  I will also be ordering other products from this company.    The company&#x27;s customer service is outstanding and more than I ever expected.     Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Okay so far. Haven&#x27;t noticed anything new.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use this product.  Fading of dark aging spots was my goal.  Very pleased with that.  Improved skin texture, smoother.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I have no sensitivities to this product (which is rare for me) and I think I am noticing some slight reduction in fine lines!  I use this in combination with a very good skin care routine including planing, exfoliation with a rotating brush, several foaming cleansers, THIS, and an Aveeno moisturizing product.  I am seeing great results especially around my crow&#x27;s feet.  I did notice one blemish come to a head where I never get them and I just think it is because this is getting down to the lower layers and bringing things that don&#x27;t belong there to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Have used entire bottle and about 2-1/2 weeks in, MY FIANCE&#x27; TOLD ME HE NOTICED SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT MY FACE AND SAID HOW GOOD MY SKIN WAS LOOKING; I said I was using this on all over but particularly for my crow&#x27;s feet and he said &amp;#34;THAT&#x27;S WHAT IT IS!&amp;#34;  He said he notices less!  So, ***that&#x27;s IT,*** this is definitely going to be in stock in my medicine cabinet at all times!  It should be noted that I also am BIG on exfoliation, so I use this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009GIOVKW/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;along with this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CNWY1YY/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;and I stay out of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Great texture, sinks into skin quickly and you can get on with applying makeup in no time if you choose to wear it.</li>
    <li> I love how the serum makes my skin bright and sooo smooth.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love the way the serum absorbs &amp; makes my skin feel so smooth &amp; good! Seeing some dark spots lighten.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product &amp; awesome customer service!</li>
    <li> I saw results within a week. My skin looks so much firmer and smooth!</li>
    <li> I actually love the serum! The texture is wonderful, it absorbs quickly, and I have experienced no irritation or redness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed the biggest difference around my eyes and mouth as far as fine lines and overall my skin seems to have a more firm, brighter appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using an over the counter night time retinol cream as well but would be interested in any retinol product you may offer once I am finished with what I currently have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually love the serum! The texture is wonderful, it absorbs quickly, and I have experienced no irritation or redness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed the biggest difference around my eyes and mouth as far as fine lines and overall my skin seems to have a more firm, brighter appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using an over the counter night time retinol cream as well but would be interested in any retinol product you may offer once I am finished with what I currently have</li>
    <li> I purchased the Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid Serum and have been using them alternately morning and night for one month.  The difference in my skin is remarkable.  My face and neck are much more smoother and I see a clearer skin tone, as well.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast service.</li>
    <li> I use this with the retinol serum. I wanted to see how well this worked. I have been using this for the past four months on my face and one of my hands (I chose my dominant hand). I am 34. Before I started using these my skin looked tired, dull, flaky, splotchy, and was starting to look older than I am. Now my skin is the best it has been in my entire life!. My skin tone is even, my pores are smaller, the blotchy redness is gone, I have no more milia (small bumps) and no more blackheads. My skin feels as soft as a babies!. I get asked for ID anytime I buy alcohol, and complemented on my skin all the time! I do not wear foundation anymore, alas I still need concealor under my eyes, these dark circles just wont fade.&lt;br /&gt;On my hand that I used it on I can see a visable difference. It is actually less lines, smotther, and more even toned. My nails on that hand are stronger and have less ridges. It has gotten to the point I had to gie up the experiment because too many people were asking me what was wrong with my other hand!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my decollette as well. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and just order this. The company is super nice and really cares if you like their products. I would never dream of retuning them, I am a customer for life, but based on my interactions they will resolve matters quickly and make sure you are happy.</li>
    <li> I was expecting an oil of some sort, but the consistency is light weight and almost runny. Goes great under my moisturizer! My face feels like baby skin even after one use. Love it</li>
    <li> Works great in helping keep my skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Since using this product, my skin looks and feels better. People are noticing and commenting positively. My skin tone is more uniform in color. It&#x27;s lightened some dark spots on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried that Nerium product which worked well at first but I noticed a bunch of bad reviews and it stopped working after a while, including making my eyes red all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no negative issues with this serum, however and it works better for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks so don&#x27;t see a difference yet, but i can say that I really like to put it on immediately after I get out of the shower or wash my face. It hydrates it and then I put on a moisturizer. I take it with me for anytime my skin just feel dry. I live in Cali and it is already hot in March! I will keep using it and give another review later. My age spots are still there, I hope they lighten or go away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for about a month now.  The Vitamin C serum is working very well.  The dark spots on my face has faded quite a bit.  Thank you for providing such an effective serum at such a reasonable price.  The fact that it&#x27;s organic makes it even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!  Please keep selling this item on Amazon Marketplace!</li>
    <li> I have been buying the Triple C serum from Burke Williams, but it&#x27;s expensive and I wondered if someone out there had something that is as good or close. After reading the reviews I settled on Tru Skin&#x27;s product. I was a little disappointed with the consistency compared to the Triple C- it&#x27;s not as thick and serum-like, but after applying and wearing for a week I would say it&#x27;s a pretty decent product. I think it&#x27;s a good alternative, although I still prefer thicker consistency. I would probably purchase it again- it seems like a good value and I am very happy that it does not have a strong scent</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product from day 1. I have recently had some fluctuation in hormone levels and needed something that would help heal my skin and get it back to normal. This serum worked the first day. I did my normal skincare routine that evening (cleansed and toned) and then put this on all over my face, then my night moisturizer on over it. I woke up the next morning with more even skin tone and texture. I was glowing! I use this every morning and every night. It does not clog my pores or make me break out. I have sensitive skin and have no adverse reactions to it. Erica from the company contacted me to see how I liked the product and was very nice. :) The customer service was excellent. I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
    <li> I did not see any changes on my face thus far, which I have been using it twice a day.  I will continue to use it until I finish the product to see if there are any improvements, then I will follow-up with my comments.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love your product and am about to order more.  I definitely see a difference around my eyes and neck. I was thrilled to find a product with Vitamin C as I have tried to make my own serum but couldn&#x27;t break it down to a liquid, so I am glad you have done so. I think Vitamin C is key for good skin.&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> I really like it and will buy it again after I used up current one. it is absorbed easily and I feel more refreshed and alert when using it. also the customer service is great.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t see any true differences in my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m updating my rating to reflect the customer service received. Giving a 5 would mean the product did what it advertised. However, The product still made me break out but the representative made sure my concern was handled accordingly.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the serum. Right away my skin felt smoother, pores appeared smaller and skin was more hydrated and full. The serum is also lightening a few dark spots on my cheek, even with recent Florida summer sun exposure that in the past would have caused the spots to darken instead, so I know it is really working! I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product and what a great value it is.  So exciting to find a beauty product that works exactly as claimed and one where you see such great results so quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic customer service as well!</li>
    <li> Bought this and Dr Oz brand. Neither have done a thing for my complexion. I&#x27;ve used MURAD C serum with success.</li>
    <li> I like this serum very much.  Overall my skin seems clearer and brighter.  I had been using a product with hydroquinone and your product has done as good/better a job without a potential carcinogen.  So far, so good !</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to aide with aging skin and I have been very pleased with the vitamin c serum. I have only used it for a little more than a week and can already tell a difference in skin tone and firmness. It is also a great value!</li>
    <li> No result whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old with dry skin. This product has help make my skin look plumper and smoother. Also, it helps lessen some of the diffuse redness I have on my face.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST VITAMIN C SERUM. I use it myself for hyperpigmentation and put a few of my clients on it and there skin is amazing and even co-workers are noticing the difference. I love this product and would buy it in bulk if I could. I definitely will recommend this to anyone. I do have 100% satisfaction with this product</li>
    <li> I love it I can see my face look much better</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a month and love it.  I have very oily and acne prone skin so I am always leary of trying new products.  This serum absorbs quickly and does not make my face oily at all. Also. ...no breakouts!  That&#x27;s the biggest seller! It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and makes my skin feel super supple! I am 40 and need all the moisture I can get without feeling like I have product on my face and this is perfect!</li>
    <li> As a Man, this is the first serum I have ever used.It has been 3 weeks now and the positive results are quite obvious.My sun spots are less&lt;br /&gt;noticeable. My skin is tighter and I look younger than my 55 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for creating a wonderful product, I expect to purchase more in the near future.</li>
    <li> I like this vitamin C, but I&#x27;ve used Obagi in the past.  So the results are much less than what I&#x27;m used to.  This is great if you are new to vitamin C serums though.  I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t need major improvement like I do!</li>
    <li> Please with service and product. Will continue doing business in the future. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using them ever since I received them(3 weeks) and my face feels so smooth. I can tell that the wrinkles around my mouth have smoothed out some already. I love the product. They dry fast and leave my face feeling great. You are doing a great job with these products.</li>
    <li> Well--I have been using it for about 2 weeks now. I started out with just applying it at night. This weekend (first day of spring) I have started applying in the morning as well. I have noticed my pores are much smaller--which is amazing as I have large pores (thanks Mom!)--and my skin seems to be more smooth and glowy. I will be 46 next week and no one ever guesses my age to be much past 35. I am sure with continued use of TruSkin it will get even better. The product glides on smoothly and dries quickly with no harsh smell. And of course 5 stars to the exceptional customer service, not only did it arrive in time, but I got more than one email from the company itself giving me specific directions for dosage and also to ask how I was liking their product. Will order from them again!</li>
    <li> applied as directed and facial skin started to sting within 30 minutes.  left product on for five hours and had to wash my face because of intense burning.  i do have sensitive, rosacea-prone skikn and this vitamin C serum is definitely too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> seen small progress until now, no smells witch is great! ill post another review in a few months;)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you TruSkin!</li>
    <li> 2nd day of use. So far so good. Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it and goes on smooth and drys wonderfully! I am happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using for a prolonged period of time-day and night I started breaking out. However, acne scars have since faded and my skin appears smoother and brighter. CSR Erica has been great in keeping track of my progress and has offered a refund or to send me a bottle with 5%. I opted for the 5% serum to see if that will work. If it does,  I will be reordering again! This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> The serum is fabulous. My skin is smoother than ever. My skin clearer than ever too. The quick cell turnover rate is apparent. I do have some acne scars too and those seem to be fading which is amazing. I was using Clinique&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector for the longest time and my skin feels healthier now with the TruSkin and its MUCH more affordable. Plus knowing there are only natural ingredients and no fillers is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> Maybe too early to tell, but it seems to be doing some good and it certainly feels good.  Never oily.</li>
    <li> Fast delver and excellent product 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> Wife likes.  Keeps re-ordering.</li>
    <li> I love it! I was told actually that my skin looks younger and I feel fresher every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I will need to order more soon.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a larger bottle for my hands so I could use it daily as a hand cream.</li>
    <li> i absolutely recommend this product. Why? I have oily, acne prone, large pore, and sensitive skin. terrible combo in my opinion. Now in my thirties I have to also worry about aging. I have spent tons of money on high end products. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are products that carry a hefty price tag but do work. However, I recently came to the realization that there is NO need to waste money like that. After tons of hours researching, looking around for reviews,  and asking several dermatologists, it boils down to ingredients. I used to pay $110 for a vitamin C serum. I found this product and decided to give it a try. Long story short, I am using my second bottle. This product is amazing. Skin type doesn&#x27;t matter. I am oily and i use it under my SPF everyday. During the winter time, I use this serum plus a moisturizer with SPF. Vitamin C will definitely help to fade out some of the ugly spots acne leave behind. Not to mention it is a great antioxidant for your skin. If your skin is oily, i suggest you use it in the morning, follow by SPF plus make up. If you don&#x27;t wear make up, use a tinted SPF, plus a setting powder. If your skin is dry, use this serum, let your skin absorb it (couple of seconds) and follow by a moisturizer with SPF. The sum is very light, your skin will absorb it quickly. Now i have to say, give it a few weeks. it is gentle yet effective. Give it sometime and you will not be sorry!</li>
    <li> Very good for the face and neck.  I put it on while my skin is still wet then follow it with moisturizer.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and plump.  Wrinkles seem to disappear.  The price is also very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I actually do like the serum so far.  I use it in the morning and evening.  And because it is summer time and I don’t want to use a heavy facial lotion,  the serum is all I am using right now in the morning.  I like that it does not look greasy on my face.  I also feel like my décolletage area is softer and smoother. </li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many serums and cremes only to see no results. I was skeptical when buying this product, but you can&#x27;t see results without trying the product. So I bought it still leary about whether it will work or not. It came quickly, and the first time that I put it on I liked the way it may my face feel. It was smooth and dried fast. The one thing that I first noticed was it made my face feel refreshed,like I had just splashed some cold water on my face. After a week, my face had a whole new look. Bright skin, less sag, and seemed much firmer. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Quality product.  Works well.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly! I love it, once I started using it it seemed like my face had brightened up and just did not look dull at all. I have no complaints at all about it. Honestly I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Product was delivered on time as told. Have every intention in ordering some of their other products.  Will highly recommend product to others.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. skin feels bright and smooth. no pore clogging. just use an amount of a dime for face and neck. it absorbs quickly by skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a very sticky feeling. the seller is also very engaging by clearly explaining how to use this product and she also follow up with me after a month.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It has a very light scent and feels good on your skin. My skin has improved greatly. I have less acne scars and less wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference after a few days. My skin is super soft and glowing. My husband also noticed a positive difference in my skin as well! I&#x27;m surprised this worked so well given the price as I have paid upwards of $70 for similar products but this works just as well.</li>
    <li> The color of my skin looks like it’s evened out more, I apply the serum every night and in the morning.  I put it under my eyes as well and noticed that it’s helped to diminish my dark circles and lines.  When I went in for a facial a couple of months ago, the esthetician highly recommended a vitamin c serum.  I believe it’s working so far and plan on purchasing another bottle.</li>
    <li> The best serum smith ,softener the skin,realy good</li>
    <li> I used this for longer than I should have seeing as it made NO difference in my skin but caused major breakouts.</li>
    <li> First time using this product. Wonder why no citrus smell. My skin feels moisture and supple. Hope it will minimise my pores over times.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice daily for about a month. I have some hyper-pigmentation on the sides of my face and noticed a slight improvement. My sun damage didn&#x27;t happen overnight, so I don&#x27;t expect results overnight either! However, my skin does look clearer and brighter. I will be a purchasing a second bottle in hopes that I continue to see improvement.</li>
    <li> Good product, easy to apply and leaves my skin more even and bright.&lt;br /&gt;However, I must say that I am never really sure about the percentage in those labels: 20%? It seems a lot... so much that I would feel at least a bit itchy or red... no?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having problems with hyper pigmentation on my face.  Almost like a mask.  I read that vitamin c could help.  I thought I would try this brand since it was reasonably priced and had good reviews.  It&#x27;s been a couple weeks and I really can see a difference.  The mask isn&#x27;t gone but it is MUCH lighter.  Plus my skin feels better.  You use such a small amount that this bottle should last for a while and the price is great.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I turn 40 next year yikes and have been wanting to try to get my skin care products in full steam ahead i saw this product and noticed it had Vitamin C and Vitamin E know that both are excellent for the skin.  The price was something i could&#x27;t pass up.  I started using it three days ago and oh my goodness its like gold in a jar i have tried so many other products that are so much more expensive with less the results.  this is going to be a staple in my skincare routine for years to come i will definitely recommend this to everyone i know.</li>
    <li> I love using this product as a makeup base. Goes on easy and a little goes along way. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve seen no improvement with my skin .</li>
    <li> Terrific great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C serum for a month, applying two times a day. I can see a big difference. I am 49 yrs.old, started hormone therapy, and also started breaking out again. The serum has help heal my face. The redness from the break outs are gone, my face feels and looks health.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C Serum. My skin is so smooth using the product. I had received compliments that I look ten years younger after using the product once in the morning and once in the evening after only 2 months. I will now use this product as part of my daily regimen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally love I t improve my skin condition I highly recommended,</li>
    <li> Sticky and useless-don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I bought this for me and my mother...my sister noticed how good both of our faces looked and begged me to buy her it for her birthday&lt;br /&gt;..makes skin look even and healthy</li>
    <li> This product was very disappointing, and I think a lot of the ads are fake. Did not help my skin at all. Caused acne. Was sticky, gooey, gross. Sad that I fell for the marketing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I am a beauty skeptic by nature but I gave this a try because it is natural and was a great price.. So I wouldn&#x27;t be out much cash if I didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s been about six weeks of daily use and can definitely see a difference in tone and texture. I have severe sun damage that is dark and spotty but those areas are lightening up now too.</li>
    <li> I love it and it works.</li>
    <li> The serum is FANTASTIC!!!  Even better than an Epicura product I purchased in the past.  I love the way it absorbs into my skin and gives it a really nice kind of glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use an entire skin regime daily that involves Bliss Fabulous Foaming Face Wash, - in conjunction with a Konjac Facial Sponge, Dickinsons Original Witch Hazel, Restore Phytoceramides, TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum, and a daily facial moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to ordering another one of your serums soon.</li>
    <li> 1 week in and (so far) skin seems softer! I have very dry, very sensitive skin. Will update review at the one month mark. Using with TruSkin Hyaluronic serum.</li>
    <li> seems to be doing fine</li>
    <li> Although no one else has remarked on how my skin looks, to me it seems brighter (I have hyper pigmentation), tighter and smoother. I also notice that my face is not as dry as it usually gets in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am pleased and will continue to use the serum.</li>
    <li> This item popped up as an item I might be interested in. I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C serums in the past and was not very impressed with them. I read the reviews of this product (thank you all who took time to write them) and decided to give it a shot.  Plus the price was right too.  I&#x27;ve been using it about every other evening for the past 3 weeks.  I could see and feel improvement in just a few days.  My husband even noticed as well as a couple of my friends.  My face is brighter, my pores seem smaller, and the skin round my eyes is smoother too.  I will purchase this again!!</li>
    <li> I love how much brighter my skin appears after just a couple of weeks use!  This will be the only serum I use from now on.  In addition, the customer service is some of the best I have ever experienced.  Very pleased overall.</li>
    <li> I like the results I&#x27;m seeing and feeling from using this serum.  My skin feels  softer and looks smoother day by day.  It works very well with the Retinol 2.5% serum and the Eminence face cream I use day and night.</li>
    <li> Definitely notice a difference in my skin! Great product at an even greater price!</li>
    <li> So far I really like the serum.  I think the color and clarity of my skin is overall improved.  I haven&#x27;t always been as consistent as I need to be when following instructions but I have done a good job using both the serum and hyaluronic acid 2x&#x27;s daily.  I love how easy both products are to apply.  They both have a nice consistency and fragrance.  Both products absorb well leaving my skin feeling clean and no overly processed.  So far I&#x27;m impressed and I think you have a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice serum. I like it very much. I use it every morning and let it soak in before putting on my make-up.</li>
    <li> I love it and I feel like my skin looks brighter!! I also think it&#x27;s taking care of an age spot-I was using frankincense oil on it but I ran out and it&#x27;s pricey even with me being a Young Living distributor. So, really like the product so far! Also I&#x27;d add that the customer service is top notch!</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C serum is wonderful- it has improved my skin and it feels smooth and hydrated. The customer service and follow up has been so nice. It is good to see a company that makes great products and cares about their customers as well.</li>
    <li> I am really liking it!  Using it morning and night for just a couple weeks now, and I feel like my skin is glowing. I do see a difference, and I&#x27;m sure over time I will even more. I will definitely keep using it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a week now and like it. I think it has made my pores less noticeable and my face brighter. Will continue using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Does not clog pores, I like how it feels under makeup, not too heavy.  Will reorder.</li>
    <li> The product is GREAT and my face feels softer &amp; firmer than before :-) Glad I purchased it!!! Thanks TruSkin Naturals 👍</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is so important to your skin expecially  if you are in the sun alot. I ride motorcycles and swim alot. This product is a must for me.</li>
    <li> The serum is really working well to fade my dark spots,  I can definitely see a difference.  My skin looks healthier too!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Vitamin C Serum thinking it would process deep into my dry skin. Within minutes it was absorbed and I felt  after two weeks saw no difference.</li>
    <li> i love this product! it really work! been using for over a month and in fact i just ordered the retinol and i cant wait to start using it. il update my review after a month</li>
    <li> Been using this product for  a little less than a week and I see the difference in my skin</li>
    <li> The product is amazing.  I feel like I am already seeing results, having only used it a week.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting younger, healthier looking skin.</li>
    <li> I have to say I do not usually respond or write reviews but I LOVE this product. My face looks smoother and clearer and some of the dark spots have actually diminished although I can still see them...hoping after continued use they go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually so surprised at how well this has worked for me and will definitely continue using it. This works so well with my Arbonne skin care products too and replaces the serum I used all together.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum each night before bed for about 2 weeks. I have noticed that my skin feels more taught, especially around the eye area. My skin feels smooth to touch also. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m crazy about this product Here&#x27;s Why...before I started using Truskin it use to take me at least an hour to makeup my face. I use to work so hard on my face to give it a natural no makeup flawless skin glow but with the use of makeup. Now with the use of Truskin my skin is actually flawless I thank God for finding this wonderful product and now it only takes me only 10 minutes to do my in the morning. I look fabulous everyday!!! ThankU</li>
    <li> I really like the way it goes on and dries quickly.  I think it&#x27;s already making a difference in the health of my skin.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working wonders on my skin (healing old acne scars like a charm and my skin is glowing!) and the service is top notch. Buy this serum, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Excellent service, great product!</li>
    <li> Fullfilled all expectations</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product but unfortunately it made me break out on my face.  I now just use it for my hands (didn&#x27;t want the return hassle-- I live in Hawaii)</li>
    <li> I was contacted by the seller almost immediately after my purchase giving me some info on the product and promising to send more soon. So far, using the serum has been lovely. My skin is smooth, even-toned and healthy.</li>
    <li> I see a difference in my skin.  I am happy with it thus far</li>
    <li> Excellent product---look and feel of skin improved w/o causing blemishes! Yay!!</li>
    <li> I feel some level of tightness. I think it may take more times with my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 29 years old and half Italian.  I&#x27;ve always had dark circles under my eyes, as do everyone else on my Italian side.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and a half, and although I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic differences, I think the darkness has definitely improved.  This is easy to use and apply.  It absorbs quickly and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave a greasy feeling.  I do have lines and crows feet under my eyes which still look exactly the same though.  Overall, I do like it, and I think it makes my face look smoother and more refreshed.  I&#x27;m more comfortable going to work without makeup (foundation) if I&#x27;m running late and don&#x27;t have the time to do my whole makeup routine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s FaBuLoUs!! A week after using this serum, My sister really did look at me and say, &amp;#34;you look younger and refreshed, did you get botox?&amp;#34;  I am sold on this product! (And yes I used the very expensive vitamin C serum from my dermatologist. I think it&#x27;s equally good and it&#x27;s got an Aloe Vera base which makes it hydrating and go on extra smooth)!  I&#x27;m a Happy customer!:)</li>
    <li> I am in love with this serum. 3 people have asked me if I&#x27;ve been getting facials lately. The serum absorbs quickly and leaves my skin very soft. I am now looking into other products from your company.</li>
    <li> My skin feels and looks great! Your product is simply amazing. Now that I&#x27;ve proven it works I&#x27;ll recommend it to my mom, my sister and my friends. Thanks for dropping by Erica. And thank you for that wonderful product and a freebie!  I hope you guys give it a try, because for sure you&#x27;ll love the results like I did! (^_^)</li>
    <li> Love how it feels on my face. It absorbs quickly. I follow it with the TruSkin Naturals Hylaronic Acid and Retinol Serum, then moisturizer. The included instructions were appreciated: I have reordered and will continue to order this product. People have commented that my skin is &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;, in a good way. I am almost 55 and my skin looks great!  I just ordered all 3 products for my husband because he noticed the youthful appearance these products are providing me.</li>
    <li> Started using this product just a few days ago and my skin feels really nice and smooth and has a glow to it!</li>
    <li> Been using for a few days and i have to say the redness on my cheeks is already going away. Lots of acne scarring, redness, some sun damage and already seeing improvements.  Eye dropper for application and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> TruSkin Naturals Organic Vitamin C moisturizer is excellent! It is easy to apply evenly, doesn&#x27;t dry with any harshness and feels silky and moisturizing as it touches the skin. I use it after a facial cleanse before applying my day or night cream. I love it! The price point is good for my purse. I&#x27;ve noticed a subtle difference in the vitality of my face and neck! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Everything is perfect. It makes my skin pretty smooth. I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> Very happy noticed difference within days thank you</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much when I tried this I was just hopeful. After just a couple weeks I could already tell a difference in the way my skin looked. I have shaved my head for years so I&amp;#34;m starting to get dark spots on the top of my head and I have dark circles under my eyes from not sleeping as much as I should. I have been using this for about a month now and my skin on my face and the top of my head does look better and healthier. I&amp;#34;m going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I use this Vitamin C Serum, morning and night and my skin glows.  Because of the even tone I have from using this serum, I don&#x27;t need foundation.  I love what it is doing for my skin, thanks TruSKin Naturals!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this stuff, because of the great reviews, but honestly it seems to do nothing whatsoever except dry on your face....I won&#x27;t bother to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> TruSkin products are the best!!! I&#x27;ve tried them all, and will continual ordering, as I appreciate the compliments on my youthful looking skin....thank-you!!  And the customer service is awesome!!!~~~~</li>
    <li> I have noticed fewer wrinkles, smoother skin and my skin generally looks healthier. I&#x27;m 46 so have some of those age type things creeping in and I&#x27;ve noticed the serum is definitely helping.</li>
    <li> This really lightened my dark spots! Didn&#x27;t take long either. My skin feels healthier and looks great.</li>
    <li> Saw results good product also excellent customer service describing product and checkin how you like, WOW</li>
    <li> I love the serum and plan to purchase more. I think it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles and possibly evening out my skin tone. Whatever it&#x27;s doing, my face and neck look better. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love it. It makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Makes my skin feel awesome look so much younger</li>
    <li> LOVE this TruSkin Vitamin C Serum! I could see results after only one week. Not to mention, the customer service far exceeded my expectations ok my first order &amp; even replaced a bottle for me that I lost while traveling! Amazing product &amp; amazing service! I&#x27;ll definitely be trying others products as well! Big thanks again to Erica!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve only been using it a week or so and I already see a lightening of the sunspots on my face!&lt;br /&gt;I really like how the serum goes on and how it feels under my regular moisturizer. Also, this company&#x27;s customer service is nothing short of amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I found this serum by chance while I was searching for another (much more expensive) C serum.  I read the reviews and researched the ingredients but was actually skeptical about the product based on the price!  I&#x27;ve been using two other brands of C serum for about a couple years now and I wondered if an inexpensive serum could produce the same results.  Guess what?  Totally can!  Not only can it produce the same results I am so far more impressed AND I saved a cool $100-ish AND the ingredients are all natural.  Win - Win - Win.  I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> I really think the serum is making a big improvement in my skin. I am using it everyday and my skin looks smoother and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;Colleen</li>
    <li> this serum is very good. i can see the visible difference in my skin. even my pimple scars are getting faded slowly. planning to buy two more bottles :). i really appreciate the customer service.</li>
    <li> I have to let you know that I have never written a review, but I decided to only because I saw a difference on my face almost immediately. I&#x27;ve only used it about 20 days and my skin appears more suple and brighter. I hope that the product will also help with the little bit of rosacea I have on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Also, which beauty product company actually takes the time to e-mail to see how the product is working for you? None before now.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Erica!&lt;br /&gt;P.s. Only gave it 4 stars as I&#x27;m waiting to see the results after a few months :)</li>
    <li> no visible improvement yet after 2 week</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Have had it for only a few weeks and already my age spots are visibly diminishing.  Am 72 years old, and am so happy to find a product that works without drying my skin.  Living in the tropics, I was a little skeptical about the 20% Vitamin C, but with a 30 spf in my moisturizer to follow up, its a winning combination!  Have tried so many high-priced facial products, none of which worked so quickly, or had the remarkable effects as this product.  Now the serum and my moisturizer in combination work like I dreamed.</li>
    <li> It was okay, it did not do what it claim to do</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I use it daily AM &amp; PM on my face, neck, décolletage and back of hands.  It tingles at first, but that just tells me it is working, and soaks right in.  You don&#x27;t need to put a lot on your skin because it spreads well.  My skin feels softer and more luminous!  I would definitely order this serum again and again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review until you have used the product for several weeks or even months.  I bought it to try to keep the aging spots at bay during the summer.  i do think they have faded a bit.  However my face does feel very dry.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this would fade my age spots, but, after using this for 4 or 5 months, I didn&#x27;t see any difference, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Great product- feels soothing when applied; my skin is looking better.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Love how the product feels on my skin!!! I can&#x27;t wait to try other products from this line. I can also see that my under eye circles are getting lighter! Excited to see more results in a few weeks. Great product!</li>
    <li> this stuff left my skin glowing. great stuff!</li>
    <li> I like the serum very much. Good consistency and absorbs very well.  I ordered it because I am spending 4 weeks in the sun and therefore using it every evening after exfoliation in an attempt to prevent or at least minimize the effects of sun exposure. So far I would say it has been a good additional product to my routine evening skin care. I use Perricone products generally so this is an extra step that I have incorporated prior to using moisturizer.  I think exfoliation is necessary before using a serum such as this either with Clarisonics or something similar,  in order to achieve best penetration of product. There is quite a lot of evidence to suggest exfoliation followed by topical Vit C is the way to go in terms of prevention and optimum maintenance of skin. I would recommend this serum based on the concentration of Vit C which I believe is 20% and the overall quality of the product. I also think it&#x27;s very well priced.</li>
    <li> Just eh. No skin irritations (+1 star) which is huge bc I have REALLY sensitive, acne-prone skin. Texture was a weird goopy feel, almost gel-like. Even after letting it dry on my skin, it balled up after putting on my lotion. I kept with it for a couple months, and saw no change unfortunately. Went to Cosmetic Skin Solutions 20% C... Much better.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the texture, it&#x27;s sticky and not smooth.</li>
    <li> This worked very well for me. Within 2 weeks I noticed a difference, especially with my dark spots.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! Better than any other vit C serum I&#x27;ve purchased. Customer service is impeccable - one of the best buying experiences I&#x27;ve ever had on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C serum is working well for me so far: it&#x27;s helping to control my occasional breakouts and gives my skin a generally smooth, consistent look by reducing red and brown blemishes.</li>
    <li> Been using this product as a preventative measure for skin aging since im only 23. But so far i like it! Seems to make my skin more glowy. :)</li>
    <li> Worth every penny.  I was very skeptical, but decided to give this serum a try,  I saw results within days, my skin was brighter, more youthful looking and not dry.  A little bit goes a long way, but does not leave your skin sticky feeling or dry.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum, I am on my 2nd bottle and can tell a big difference.  My husband says that my skin looks &amp;#34;creamier and smoother&amp;#34;  Give it a try you will love it too.</li>
    <li> This feels great and the ingredients are great!</li>
    <li> The serum’s I have ordered have worked very well for me.  My skin is much clearer and softer since I began using TruSkin.  I am glad I finally found something natural and something that actually works.  I will keep ordering as long as you are still selling it.</li>
    <li> I have seen a great change on my face, its smoother and I feel my wrinkles are lighter. Loving it!</li>
    <li> can be used under makeup</li>
    <li> I like the serum very much. It is smoothe and hydrating, and does not irritate even close to the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have already sent the link to friends, hopefully some will order the serum also!!</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin very smooth</li>
    <li> Liked this product while I used it, but my face broke out like crazy when I ran out of it. It was like going on or off retinol.</li>
    <li> First off, I would like to start by saying I NEVER write reviews for products. Like many of us, I&#x27;m super busy and never get around to them, but this product is worth a few minutes of my time! Amazinggg Vitamin C serum! I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 weeks and I can already see a noticeable improvement in the texture and clarity of my skin. I use this morning and night and cannot wait to continue doing so to see even more noticeable results. On top of this being a great product, their customer service is A+++! I received an email before and after my order was placed notifying me of it&#x27;s status and inquiring as to what my feedback was after trying the product. You can tell the company really wants to have complete customer satisfaction! I have recommended this to all my friends &amp; family!</li>
    <li> Excellent service and excellent product!  It is all that you would want to help with the reducing of fine lines and the appearance of aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products but this one has helped in a way no other product has when applied consistently and over a short period of time,&lt;br /&gt;In one month I began to see a difference, in two months much more, and now in my third month the improvement is such that others who know my age are complimenting my more youthful appearance. .&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is the best that I have ever experienced.  It is because of the genuine caring customer service that I continued the second month and love the results that have followed.</li>
    <li> I will give this serum 4 starts . I have used my first bottle and I have seen really good changes in my skin. First of all , I have a really oily and acne prone skin. I used this serum in morning after shower and before going to bed. This made my skin glow and it reduced the occurrence of acne too on my skin . Currently i am switching on another vitamin c serum of serumetology  . If because this serum does not help you with fading acne spots. I will give another feedback if i comes back to this product again .</li>
    <li> This is the first product of this type I have used.  I was extremely pleased an surprised how it:  1)  Took a small amount to cover my face, neck and upper chest; 2) Has almost no smell; 3)  Does not affect application of makeup; 4)  Made my skin both smoother and firmer; 5)  DID NOT irritate my very sensitive skin AND 6)  Has facilitated abatement of rosacea and that has permitted nightly use of the Clarisonic brush.  Before using this serum, I was only able to sometimes use  it twice a week.  My skin now has a normal skin tone and I almost use no foundation when I do use it.  I am extremely pleased with this and ordered another bottle.  When comparing it to the ingredients of other serums, it seemed to have the most natural formula so I tried it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations</li>
    <li> I have used it for a week, and I see my skin more smooth, and whiter. I am impressive the result. I will continue use it. Thank you for great product with good price.</li>
    <li> I am 67 years young and have tried a lot of skin care products over the years, and I absolutely love this serum!!  The customer service is probably the greatest I have ever dealt with.  Please do yourself a favor and at least try this product, it&#x27;s 100% guaranteed. What do you have to loose? I added this serum to my daily and nightly skin care regime and after the first week I could see a huge difference in the texture of my skin and some of age spots are lighter, and more moisture already!! Unfortunately I still have my &amp;#34; Happy Lines &amp;#34; but will be adding the Retinol next week---Who knows--- this journey with TruSkin Naturals could be my secret to younger looking skin. --------</li>
    <li> It works slowly. used for a month. has great texture and dries nicely.</li>
    <li> A very good serum. Have noticed a huge difference in my skin. Not drying. Leaves skin soft with my use of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not, but I love the way it feels when I put it on my face. I&#x27;ll see if it actually does anything. I do like the company because it&#x27;s cruelty-free. Those are the only companies I will use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks and so far my skin is definitely looking better. There has been no irritation or breakouts, plus it doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor like other serums I have used. I would order this again!</li>
    <li> Even though no improvement on my dark patches due to melasma since I bought a bottle 2.5wks ago, but customer service for this product has contacted me to ask about if it has helped so far.  After reading my complaint, she sent me a free bottle for continue usage, in the hope that with longer term usage, it will lighten my dark patches.  Wow, I have never encountered such great service.  So 5 star for the customer service.</li>
    <li> I like this product, been good for my skin, very light not too much oil I can see my skin improving the more I use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for two weeks now, and I love it! By day three, I had already noticed a visible difference. The best way I can describe it is that it&#x27;s given me a youthful glow mere minutes after using it. This is especially true when I put it on before I go to sleep at night. I wake up looking refreshed. I&#x27;m a fan! They&#x27;ve created a great natural product!</li>
    <li> I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin since I&#x27;ve been using TruSkin Naturals (3 weeks now).  I use it in the morning after I take a shower and in the evening after I wash my face.  I moisturize after using the serum.  It appears to &amp;#34;plump up&amp;#34; my skin and wrinkles are gradually diminishing.  My skin isn&#x27;t nearly as splotchy as it was.  I love this product!  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m seeing such wonderful results in just 3 weeks. By the way, I&#x27;m 70 years old, still working full time as an administrative assistant for a private middle/high school and have a very active life.  I&#x27;m not ready for the rocking chair and I want to look as good as I feel.</li>
    <li> Best I have used so far</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I can see results on my face and it&#x27;s better than other expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews but I have to for this product. My skin is a mess from hormonal changes, I am 45 and it was looking dull yet I was getting pimples. The product says to wait at least 3 weeks but I can&#x27;t believe the change in less than a week. My counter is full of bottles of products (waste of money) and they would either irritate my skin or make me look greasy or dry it out. I am not great at giving reviews but I have to say, it was more than worth the money.</li>
    <li> Day 1:  Wow, I slept with only this stuff on my face, and my skin looks better already!  Nicer, more even complexion with smaller looking pores.  I love this stuff, feels so good on my skin.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep updating results, as I see them :)</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with the Derma Roller* It may take a while to see true results but I think it helped to heal my skin faster.</li>
    <li> I love the serum I purchased! I feel that my skin looks smoother and tighter! I have oily skin. The serum doesn&#x27;t make it worse, so that&#x27;s a plus! I will most likely buy again! I told a friend who is buying as well.</li>
    <li> great product..love it..the feel is awesome</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results. The texture of my skin has improved considerably and I have received many compliments on my radiant skin.</li>
    <li> I cannot see results.</li>
    <li> makes skin feel smooth and soft after applied</li>
    <li> Great product. Great service. We will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I had been shopping around for a vitamin C serum and happen to stumble across this product.  I like it because it works, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and have noticed that my skin is much firmer and feels soft.  I also love the fact that its ORGANIC!  When I ordered the product it came in quickly and was even pleasantly surprised by a follow up e-mail with regards to how the product was working out for me.  I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really delighted with the effect of the serum. It goes on nice, absorbs quickly, does not dry my skin at all and I think minimizes my t-zone from becoming as oily as it usually does. I find I&#x27;m &amp;#34;powdering my nose&amp;#34; much less often throughout the day. It&#x27;s an instant noticeable improvement of shrinking of pores and minimizing lines. My make up goes on so smooth and my skin looks just as smooth. I&#x27;m 44 and it makes my face look really young!</li>
    <li> Again, Thank you, TruSkin.  I&#x27;ve posted before that I really liked knowing I was putting good ingredients on my face.  After having used it for about 6 weeks I can tell you, I see a difference on my skin.  For one thing my sister keeps telling me how good my skin looks and wants to know what I&#x27;m using.  I had a brown spot on my face that has almost disappeared from sight.  I can tell spot is still there but it&#x27;s no longer brown making it nearly invisible.  My pores seems to have gotten smaller.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> I noticed the difference in my fine lines and it works well with my moisturizer, great product. I have a very sensitive skin, but I did not get any allergic reaction. I will continue to keep using this product.</li>
    <li> On my third bottle and I love the way my skin feels!  It definitely looks fresher and smoother!  My foundation just glides on since I&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;m not using as much foundation thanks to the serum!  I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I love the serum and my skin is looking great</li>
    <li> Best customer service from this company.  I love the look of my skin after using it for 30 days.  I&#x27;ve noticed brighter skin.</li>
    <li> I really like the vitamin c serum. I am using it at night in conjunction with bear berry extract. I usually mix the two in the palm of my hand prior to applying. And then I apply moisturizer, usually after the two are absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the vitamin c has given my face a smoother appearance. :) I really like that the serum comes in a glass bottle, has a dropper dispenser and is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received follow up emails informing me how to use vitamin c and later checking on how it worked for me!! Fantastic customer service!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin looks great and fine lines and wrinkles are disappearing  after only two weeks of use. I will definitely reorder this product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum, along with a couple other brands made by &amp;#34;Oz&amp;#34; and another label (I can&#x27;t remember at this moment) that is 100% Organic... That being said, I love using all products, but this one stands out specifically (I think), because it has a higher concentrate of pure Vitamin C!  My skin instantly tingles, with a warming sensation that isn&#x27;t overpowering, but almost refreshing.  As it dries, my skin is visibly tighter and silky soft.  I have waited to post a review after giving it some time to use and I immediately noticed a difference in my skins appearance.  After using it for almost a month now, I can tell you, I don&#x27;t know why I waited to use this as part of my daily skin regimen!  I just turned 40 and have been told I have skin of a 30 year old to begin with... After using this product, I feel I have reversed more signs of aging with the lines around my eyes... my smile lines and small lines in my forehead have all but disappeared.  I absolutely LOVE this product and highly recommend it to anyone who has been on the fence about &amp;#34;if it really works&amp;#34;... It&#x27;s a great price with a phenomenal value!  The gift that keeps giving!!  Thank you TruSkin Naturals!!!!  You have a lifelong client with me.....  :)</li>
    <li> I love the serum. It works great. As a matter of fact I think it works  better than the expensive Skinceuticals brand.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I completed an entire bottle of this before reviewing just to make sure I loved it as much as I thought I did.  I&#x27;ve been using this serum along with OZ Naturals Ocean Mineral Toner for over a month now and my face has responded incredibly well to the combination of both of these products.  I have blemish prone skin and occasional breakouts due to stress and my face has almost completely cleared up and I am proud to say that I am blemish free finally!  I now feel comfortable going out in public without any makeup on my face and know that my skin is radiant and looks fantastic.  The key to results with this product is to use a toner and to be consistent with your usage! I began putting it on just once a day since I have never used a serum or toner before and after completing the first bottle, I am using it twice a day now.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have been using for several months now.  Immediately I noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin.  It is smoother and brighter and I have received comments about how great my skin looks.  In addition, the customer service is excellent.  I have received individualized feedback from TruSkin Naturals about my skincare regimen and will try their other products.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice serum, my skin is definitely softer and brighter, very affordable too.</li>
    <li> I have problem skin with cystic acne flaring up often, but I must say using your vitamin C serum (even though it has been a short period of time so far) has definitely left my skin feeling softer and smoother, especially when I wake up in the morning. There is almost a dewy, glow-like feel that I&#x27;ve noticed recently. I read the instructions and I understand it can take a few weeks to months to see full results but I definitely would recommend this product and will be ordering in the future.</li>
    <li> Saw results In a couple of weeks very good</li>
    <li> I lave this oil My skin has improved for the better, it removes stains and whiten skin was very wet wonderful</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. After three weeks, my skin tone seems more even and vibrant.  It has a pleasant neutral scent, goes on smoothy and is well absorbed.  It leaves my face with a nice slightly tight feeling. I apply a daily moisturizer on top and they seem to pay well together.</li>
    <li> Great product! ! Can definitely tell a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> I really like the serum!&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my skin tone looks more even or clearer since I&#x27;ve been using it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I really like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this for 15 days and it works ! I have dry skin&lt;br /&gt;I feel my skin is better and it&#x27;s glowing&lt;br /&gt;What I like in in this product that it&#x27;s non-greasy Fast absorption from the skin and non perfumed .&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it twice daily and I think it will give  a better results after a month or so</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It can dry the skin after applying, but that goes away when I apply my moisturizer on. It&#x27;s a serum.. but face lotion. :)&lt;br /&gt;Pro: evens out my skin tone to where I can feel good about wearing no makeup outside the house.&lt;br /&gt;Con: the serum is smooth when applying to skin, but face will feel dry if you don&#x27;t apply face lotion or moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am a big fan.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this product....it is clearing my skin up. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> great product, excellent service!</li>
    <li> Just okay and not sure I would repurchase because I have to use about 4 drops because it doesn&#x27;t spread easily.  The price was great and had to try.</li>
    <li> I waited for a month after using this to write my review. My skin has had a noticeable difference. I can actually  leave the house with out foundation now. I was very consistent. I washed my face good every morning and night and applied this serum. It brighten my skin and lighten some of my dark spots.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a week so far so good!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! 100% addicted! My skin looks and feels amazing! Even my mom asked what I have been doing, saying my skin looks glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for such an amazing serum!</li>
    <li> I just started using the Vitamin C Serum in conjunction with some Hyaluronic Acid serum.  In combination, I am seeing some beginning results after just 3 days of application.  I am so optimistic that continued regular use should &amp;#34;feed&amp;#34; my facial skin with important nutrients that will return some strength and supple-ness to my face -- especially my cheeks.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using such a product.  I&#x27;ve tried many different things with limited success.  I am turning 37 in August and have started to notice my skin is showing my acne scares, and very fine expression lines around my mouth and forehead. My skin is very oily.  Literally since the first time I put it on I was able to see a difference in the texture, as the product is not greasy and allows for putting on my powder evenly. I also noticed my fine forehead lines smooth out and I have not broken out as much.  I just ordered another bottle as well as the other product you sell to see if it evens my tone more and helps with making my jaw line a little tighter.</li>
    <li> Yes...I am enjoying the results I am getting from this serum. After only two weeks, my skin looks smooth &amp; lovely. When this bottle is finished...I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for this awesome product!  I have been using it for approx 1 month and my skin looks fantastic!  It has taken away many of the fine lines I have on my forehead, and around my eyes.  It is very light, has no scent and feels fabulous on my skin!  I will order this on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> In association with the other serum, I should look beautiful.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so soft and bright my little line have gone away and i have just a week in use imagine the posibilitys</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I put it on in and the morning and the Hyaluronic Acid serum on in the evening with my moisturizer cream and my face feels so nice and smooth. I purchased this about 2 weeks ago and I can already see the results of the lines under my eyes are getting lighter.</li>
    <li> It really works  GREAT... Give it a try.  Had NO problem with burning or being tender on the face.  go for it.</li>
    <li> Well, first of all, the shipping was super fast, I received the serum 2 days later I ordered it. Second of all, I have never had better customer service experience then with Erica. She is helpful, fast and helps in every way so that each customer is happy!!! The product is amazing!!  Far beyond expectation! It is smooth,easy to use and I could see results very soon with my fine lines around my eyes and lips. I surely will repurchase  and I surely recommend this product to anyone and everyone! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four days now and I like the way it soaks into my skin and leaves it feeling smooth.  My main purpose is to help breakup the terrible melasma I have on my face.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s helping it but so far, I do like this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this serum but I had a definite allergic reaction to it. It is not 100% organic either, which is misleading. I&#x27;m not sure which ingredients caused my skin to act up but it could also be the level of vitamin c, which is 20%....the highest level. I don&#x27;t think someone should start at 20% if they haven&#x27;t tried serum before but that&#x27;s just my thought.</li>
    <li> I will not buy another serum. This is a bottle of gold, and worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I was skeptical of the claims, but decided to give this one a shot after a lot of research. I&#x27;m 35, just starting to show signs of aging like a few brown spots and fine lines. I have never used a serum before, so I followed the directions and use it once a day, before my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a believer in this serum! My skin is so soft, the little age lines have all but disappeared and the brown sun spots are gone. It has even helped subside the look of a large scar I have on my calf. I know it&#x27;s working when even my husband comments on how soft my skin is.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My skin has been much smoother and less acne prone since I started using it. Also, customer service was incredible. The owner actually emailed me letting me know how to use the product and followed up seeing how I liked it. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> No problems with using the product. I sent a picture of myself to a friend, and she complimented&lt;br /&gt;on how young I looked. Now, I did have a restful summer. I will keep using as I head back into the&lt;br /&gt;fall-winter seasons.</li>
    <li> It do work. I order one for my mom as gift. And she love it. Now she is finish her first bottle, and wanting more. This time she is getting two 2oz. It make her happy.</li>
    <li> This really is the best Vit C product I&#x27;ve ever used. One of the side benefits is it cleared my mild seborrhea dermatitis, no more cortisone! It has a nice consistency and NO scent. Wonderful!!!!! I have been  looking for a product like this, something that was multi purpose, with a lot of organic ingredients that did the job. This serum is the real deal!  They also have wonderful customer service to match the great product! Thanks TruSkin!!</li>
    <li> It works very well. I felt different after used a bottle. Going to order mores.</li>
    <li> I ran across this product one day while shopping on Amazon. I had never really used a Vitaman C type serum before but I was willing to give it a try.  I am in my 50&#x27;s so products that help with aging skin and if it works you can never get enough of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Co-Founder wrote me a nice email shortly after I got it explaining how to use it.  I followed her instructions and have been using this for about 3 months now.  I am very please with the results. I can tell the difference in my face &amp; especially in my neck.  I was getting concerned with the way my neck was looking before I started using this product.  Age doesn&#x27;t stop for anyone!  But this product made the skin on my neck softer and more supple.  It took alot of the redness out of my face.  Just a little bit goes a long way!  And the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!  I would recommend this product to anyone even younger woman.  I wished I had something like this years ago. But I have it now and won&#x27;t give it up!  Thanks TruSkin Naturals for a really great product!</li>
    <li> I really like the serum. I believe it is making a difference on the appearance of my skin, in a good way! It glides on nicely and soaks into my skin with no stickiness or high gloss  afterwards. My skin has a more even appearance and fine lines are less noticeable on my forehead, which is the reason I tried it. I will be reordering when I run out.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful! I have ordered a 2nd bottle so that I won&#x27;t run out. My skin has been especially dry and sensitive this winter, but since I started using this product my skin is more hydrated and less irritated. My skin is softer and the 2 dark spots on my face have faded significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller contacted me personally to make sure that I was happy with the product, which I thought was nice. Certainly above and beyond the usual customer service.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this serum made me break out horribly.  My skin is tot sensitive for most products, but I&#x27;d recommend this for a friend to try.</li>
    <li> This is not pure vitamin c. Because of the added vitamin e in this product: my skin broke out. Not good.</li>
    <li> I am 54 years old and my skin is extremely sensitive. I have tried many many products  in an attempt to brighten my complexion and reduce the signs of aging. Most of them cause my sensitive skin to burn and peel so I end up throwing them away and wasting a lot of money.  When I read  the reviews for this product I saw that other women with sensitive skin had used the product without a problem so I decided to give it a try.  I have been using it for two weeks now and I love it.  I have experienced no redness, stinging or burning and my complexion already feels smother and is starting to look fresher and brighter.  I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great serum for mature skin. Helps even skin tone as well as moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I saw an immediate improvement in the size of my pores and fine wrinkles.  As I continue to use it, even my deepest wrinkles are improving.  I would recommend it to anyone and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product a short time but I already noticed a slight difference in the skin on my face and backs of my hands.  It goes on smoothly, absorbs very quickly and dries fast.</li>
    <li> Excellent product my lines to disappear after three weeks of using.</li>
    <li> I really like the serum.  It absorbs into my skin quickly and I believe my skin looks smoother.</li>
    <li> Saw results almost instantly, skin is soft and dark spots are visibly lighter after one week.  Referred to a friend who also saw immediate results.</li>
    <li> I am no stranger to Vitamin C serums.  But, I was a stranger to the superior product and high level of customer service I received from TruSkin naturals.  This serum is fantastic in its effectiveness, the price is hands down as good as you will find, and the customer service is top notch. I am in my late 30s, have spent my days in the sun, and am looking to fight fine lines and dark spots.  After approximately 4 weeks of use, my dark spots are visibly lighter, the texture of my skin is bright and glowy, and my skin feels soft and smooth.  I am using with a retinoid as well, and the two products compliment each other brilliantly.  You will not be disappointed in this product.  And if for some crazy reason you are, I am confident the company will bend over backwards to make things right.</li>
    <li> Working very well on red spots and overall smoothness in a short period of time.  Using every night but not yet seeing as much of an  improvement in deeper creases between my brows.  Overall, I am happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using a whole bottle. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It goes on smoothly and makes my skin look great. I have noticed a difference in the month I have been using this product.</li>
    <li> i am very happy with this product. i&#x27;ve bought it three times so far. my skin is dry and middle aged. This vitamin c serum has really plumped it up and smoothed it out.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, item just as described. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and my skin already feels very moisturized. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. After ordering a derma roller for my post Retin A nightmare, I needed to get my skin back in order asap. I ordered this product bc of the many reviews and the positive feed back. It&#x27;s as light as water, dries super fast, has no scent, and has been working great. After two months of using this and a derma roller i have to say I&#x27;m satisfied. My bottle is almost finished so I&#x27;ll be sure to order this soon!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Makes my skin feel and look great - even after just one week.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it.  After applying the serum and waiting for it to dry before applying the moisturizer, the moisturizer went on sticky.  I didn&#x27;t like the feel of my skin afterwards.</li>
    <li> I am in love with the serum! My skin looks amazing!! Last week I had a really bad sunburn I forgot to put sunscreen and the only thing I applied was the serum, my skin looks and feels great. I will definitely buy it again. Love it 🙋🏼</li>
    <li> Love this. Great product. Love that most ingredients are organic.</li>
    <li> Further UPDATE 05/26/15:  I just completed the 2nd bottle and I&#x27;ve applied for the 50% off next purchase as I&#x27;d like to see if I get even further and better results over time and for my physiology; I have to add that I have seen my pores tighten, however having said that this occurs as reaction to pure use of this product as after using minimal and light moisturizer I find that result is defeated by the seeming weight(?) of the moisturizer - oh well, perhaps I need to change that to a product that works with this one to maintain to great results. . . . UPDATE 05/12/15:  Let me start out saying that as a male customer my own experience with this product and company has been nothing short of interesting and exciting to be a part, that said I am into my 2nd week and nearing the end of the 3rd week of my 2nd bottle, decided upon over a discussion how some results take a little longer, and as it turns out mine have taken a bit longer than originally hoped, but perhaps my personal expectations were not realistic of the 1st bottle as results of my 2nd bottle have provided better and unexpected results, though for me, not all the specific results sought.  Starting with the better results, they are as follows, (1) the darkening circles below my eyes have lightened and that brightens the face a lot and (2) my jawline appears to have tightened, enough to provide definition were there has not been any in a long while but along with that the sagging skin below the jawline has also tightened a bit adding to an unexpected and surprisingly positive result and enough to comment; now for the results that have not arrived very much to my chagrin, though in all fairness each of us are expected to have varying results both good and less so - (1) my pores have not tightened at least enough to notice and comment positively (then again what would be considered reasonable results where tightening pores are concerned?), (2) my sun and age spots remain unchanged, and again they are not solidor dark but very much in the middle so I did expect reasonable and visible improvement, but sadly that has not yet occurred.  The question now is will I go a 3rd bottle given I did get unexpected results w/o the expected ones?  I am compelled to say YES, because I want to see if my personal results are within this 3rd try, and while it may not be, wouldn&#x27;t it be great given the good results so far if I got what I expected?  Then again even if I didn&#x27;t, this product has shown itself to be so strong a contender in skin care that it should not surprise anyone who have seen their own improvement and who confidently espouse the great results they&#x27;ve received.  It is a good value for what it does deliver, and I have confidence that my results have been so.  I certainly hope you have as good if not better results.  But also, I should add my conversation has been with Erica of TruSkin Naturals and in her, the company has an individual who helps to make the difference in the vision and drive therin, a very rare aspect of any company though many claim they have it . . . ORIGINAL review:  my pores didn&#x27;t tighten up.  my sun and age spots did not retreat and they&#x27;re not solid either.  my skin did glow - a red if you will.  it is gentle on my sensitive skin.  my review is not a complaint but a personal observation of my own results such as they were - not bad but nothing near the words that imply improvement i sought based on those words.  everyone has to find their own results.  mine results were lack luster.  i wish the results could have been better so that I could buy another bottle if it but i am not encouraged to do so.  this one is ok for the few things that it manages to do on my skin though not for my skin.</li>
    <li> The customer service is perfect they keep sending me info about the best way to use this product. This is the fifth day I&#x27;ve used it and I can feel smooth in my skin and l like the smell.</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  It tightened, plumped and smoothed my skin.  I am over 60, so finding something that makes such a difference is really quite wonderful.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Have not seen much of a difference yet</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Noticeable difference in my skin just after one use. Highly recommend this product and this seller!!!</li>
    <li> my skin looks glowing and bueatiful will buy again its been 3 weeks and i have not had one breakout</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Seems very soothing to my face after a day of sun exposure</li>
    <li> I am now on my third bottle of this product. Some people have mentioned dissatisfaction with viscosity but I love the thinness to the product. I apply it first in my regimen day and night and a little goes a long way. I was a lifeguard for four years in my late teens and early 20&#x27;s so I have a lot of sun damage. This has helped my dark spots vanish, my complexion glow, and given my skin an evenness that I haven&#x27;t seen in years (I&#x27;m 33)  I LOVE this product. On top of this, they have wonderful customer service, quick delivery, and offers for discounts. I have tried three other vitamin c products prior to this and this is the first brand I&#x27;ve ordered from repeatedly. I highly recommend this product and I only write reviews after I feel confidence with a product over a period of time.</li>
    <li> How absolutely delightful to come across a product that works so amazingly well and also has such a caring team behind it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am at how well this serum is working for me! I&#x27;ve tried a ton of Nutrogena products with no results to speak of. Same goes for Proactiv. I am 35 years old and have always had great skin. Recently however, I&#x27;ve begun breaking out along my jawline and it&#x27;s been leaving behind some dark marks. Well...a lot of dark marks. Well, almost immediately after I began using your product I noticed the marks begin to fade! The tone and texture of my skin showed considerable improvement too. Even my husband, who never notices anything, noticed the improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum it up...I love it!! The only thing I would change is to offer a larger sized bottle!</li>
    <li> If I could give this 10 stars I would!!!  It is wonderful...makes my skin feel smooth and moisturized, but dries in a way that it almost doubles as a perfect primer to put on before make-up.  There is no strange scent, no greasy feel, nothing about it I don&#x27;t like.  I also experienced great customer service throughout the ordering process--great communication!  I would recommend this to people of all skin types, and will be ordering again soon!</li>
    <li> Im on my second bottle and my face is smooth; now i only use it once a day because it is strong; my skin is firmer and looks clearer and some of my old acne scarring is looking better  i will definitely keep using this product</li>
    <li> great item and pricing and availablity</li>
    <li> I like it. Vitamin C oil drops is one of the best vitamins for the skin.</li>
    <li> I waited to write a review until I used just about the entire contents.  Unfortunately, I did not see the satisfactory results that is posted by the other users.  I do not intend to purchase this serum again and will try another brad.</li>
    <li> I just ordered another bottle of this. have had it for about a week now and I REALLY like it! it feels good, soaks in nicely and doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume or anything. it just feels good, PERIOD. id like to try their other products too. I don&#x27;t wear makeup and have been looking for products to assist with my skin looking better, products that don&#x27;t goo-up my face. because no matter what I am not wearing goop on my face! I wore makeup, full face and all the trimmin&#x27;s until I was about 29 then I went in a different direction and didn&#x27;t even shave for a decade (O: yes... that direction, so then at about 40 or so (im 57) I just returned to lipstick (which I love) and some undereye liner  and that about where it has stayed with me for the last 20 or so yrs. once every 5 years I put mascara on, once every 10 yrs I smoke dope too, that&#x27;s enough of both of these to send me right back to what works best for me! NONE of either! LOL</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is thick and  spreads evenly, more so then a thinner almost water like product. I liked the results for my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Your serum is truly wonderful, not perfumed - which I like it! My skin is superbly sensitive, I&#x27;m allergic to everything...no problem with your product.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;  GG</li>
    <li> UPDATE: This seller really stands behind their product. It didn&#x27;t work for me, but others seem to be very happy with it. They offer excellent customer service.   Not impressed by this product at all. I figured how could so many 5-star reviews be false? Then I tried using this product and, apart from it smelling a bit sour which I don&#x27;t mind that much, it simply does nothing. It has no effect whatsoever-- fading sunspots, smoothing out skin, minimizing acne scars, all of the things it claims to do, I saw nor felt any difference at all. A complete waste of $20.</li>
    <li> This product really works! I noticed that my lines got soften, like a much younger skin! Friends asked what I used and already recommend this to them. Super bice product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but feel the need to with this product.  I am very picky when it comes to skin care.  I have combination skin that is sensitive so it hard to find products that work well.  This one does!!  It absorbs nicely and does not leave an oily residue. It also does not clog pores and makes skin look great!!!</li>
    <li> Skin looks clearer and fresher.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is by far the best on the market.  I have used two bottles since discovering it a couple months ago.  My search is over-----nothing comes close to the product and the customer service behind it  Thanks!</li>
    <li> The information stated that it helps to reduce dark circles. My dark circles have not even moved. Waste of my money. I hope I can return the item</li>
    <li> My skin is much softer, but if you wish to reduce wrinkles you need their Best Retinol Serum for Wrinkles &amp; Fine Lines. Both products are EXCELLENT depending what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum for 2 weeks now. I was a little nervous as my skin tends to break out (I usually just use an all natural cleanser and that&#x27;s it). I figured going into my mid thirties I should become pro-active. So on my 1st application, I had just gotten pretty badly burned on my face, it didn&#x27;t sting and went on like silk. The next morning my face was red from the sunburn but not painful like I expected! Over the next few days I used the serum at night after washing my face, I really thought my face would peel...but it didn&#x27;t!! My skin looked and felt really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have upped my usage to twice a day and really love how consistent my skin tone is. This product is definitely 5 stars and I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
    <li> Love this product. My skin looks and feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really liked this serum. It did fade my brown spots and it seemed to soften my skin. It is thick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for two weeks and have already seen a difference in my skin - softer, smoother, with a healthy-looking glow.  The serum&#x27;s texture is pleasant and a little goes a long way.  It spreads easily over face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and dries with no tacky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I&#x27;ve begun using it on my upper arms, which is why I&#x27;m here ... to buy another couple of bottles.  Believe it or not, I&#x27;m seeing a difference in the resiliency of the skin there, as well! So, bottom line, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The serum worked great. I use it every night. Once it has completely dried I like applying a thin layer of coconut oil. This combination works very well together.</li>
    <li> I see a visible difference in the tightness of my skin as well as my pore size. Leaves you hydrated but I still need to use my face lotion after which isn&#x27;t a big deal. I use it every evening before bed and it is now part of my daily routine. Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying your product!  I am in my mid-40&#x27;s and trying to regain some of the effects of time.  I enjoy how smooth my skin feels without the heavy or greasy feeling of a moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve recommended your product to 2 of my friends and they are waiting for their orders to fulfill from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!! very light, and leave skin feeling soft and rejuvenated!!! didnt have any problems at all, and It can be used mixed with the other serums and even with medicated creams.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a change in my skin.  The lines have become softer and there is definitely a brightening to the skin with the Vitamin C.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Nice product but doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it everyday and she can tell a big difference in her face. Like puffiness under eyes has dramatically decreased. She says it looks younger. Wrinkles are less pronounced. Yay</li>
    <li> it is great especially for the price</li>
    <li> It really works! After a few days of using it i feel my skin softer. Excellent product</li>
    <li> I use every morning and night and don&amp;#34;t see any change</li>
    <li> This product is amazing - it lives up to its claim and I am so happy that I discovered this product - I am a believer and will continue to integrate this into my daily regime!</li>
    <li> I am loving the serum. My skin looks and feels smooth and clear. I noticed from the first time I used it how amazing my skin felt. The serum has helped with the texture of my skin and has even helped clear up my cystic acne and reduce scarring.  I hope to see even more results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum! This is my first time ever buying and using a serum religiously on my face. The progress is slow and subtle but I can tell that my skin is smoother and my hyper pigmentation is fading :)</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this.  I look terrific.  I gave it 5 stars because it actually does what it says it will do. I think it really has made a difference in the deep lines around my mouth.  I&#x27;m 64 years young and I know it has brightened the skin under my eyes.  Over all, more brightness. Awesome stuff.  Definitely will keep using and will get a few bottles for my daughters.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> After using the product for 3 weeks, I can honestly say, I love how my skin looks and feels. I have noticed a difference in the softness and quality of my skin and it is definately smoother. Will continue to make this a regular part of my beauty regimen!</li>
    <li> I like it has good ingredients, how moisturize and tighten my skin, but I feel little itchy every time after I apply it on my face. I guess my skin is little sensitive...</li>
    <li> I love this product! Wanted the hydrating ingredients and was a little skeptical about reducing dark spots. I have a fairly large dark spot that is almost not visible even without make up in only a couple of weeks of twice daily use.  This product is worth it just for the hydration alone but the dark spots disappearing a true bonus!!!!</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised by the results.  I do feel the fine lines have decreased or disappeared.  My skin feels more tight, and I have received some compliments by friends stating, &amp;#34;you look good and rested&amp;#34;.  So I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I am loving the Vitamin C serum so much. I was telling a friend this week how my skin is looking so well, smooth, and healthy.</li>
    <li> I am the lucky beneficiary of extremely high-end facial products, Guerlain, La Prairie, Nautra Bisse, etc., that a close friend gives to me after giving them a cursory chance to work. I love these products, however, I would never be able to afford them if I had to buy them. With that said, I have been on a quest to find affordable, high-quality products that work just as well or better than the bank-braking labels. Guess what! This is it!! TruSkin Naturals&#x27; Vitamin C Serum is that product! I didn&#x27;t really expect much, since that has been my experience experimenting with other affordable facial products, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a week and a half and I&#x27;ve noticed that any blemishes I had healed quickly and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. The tone and texture of my skin has improved. The serum has a nice consistency and spreads easily, dries quickly, without irritation. After applying, I follow up with my favorite night cream. I well certainly order this serum again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, my face was immediately softer and fine lines seem to be disappearing. Would absolutely recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I like this serum. My skin looks brighter, smoother, and firmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a couple months now. I apply it once daily, each AM. I&#x27;m sure my face and neck are more taught, less prone to break outs and even in the dead of winter, incredibly moisturized. It&#x27;s a great addition to my skin care regimen. I&#x27;m approaching 40 and feel the need to start taking skin care more seriously. Affordable way to do it, right here</li>
    <li> can see some difference. must use as directed.</li>
    <li> It feels great on the skin. I have been using this product for a few months and It appears to be making a difference,  I wbe without itould not   I have used this product for many months and I would not be without it. It is not sticky or greasy and just feels good on the skin..</li>
    <li> I really like the serum. My face appears to be smoother. The redness on my face and chest seems to be getting lighter which is awesome. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> not bad but not so good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C and the Retinol serum from TruSkin and can already see a difference. I&#x27;m gong to add the hyaluronic acid next. In the past I used similar products from my dermatologist at a much higher cost. These products from TruSkin are a good value.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Vitamin C Serum! I have been using it now for over a week and have noticed significant changes in both my skins texture &amp; tone... I have even noticed some dark spots have started to fade! I initially thought this might have all been in my head, as I have been struggling to find the perfect product(s) for my troubled skin for years, but when my sister commented on my how great my skin looked last night, I knew I had finally found it! I am anxiously awaiting the already pleasantly surprising results that will undoubtedly come in the next weeks, months, YEARS! :)</li>
    <li> product  arrived promptly and the informtion given by the manufactorer was very helpful.  i love this prodct and my skiin looks lovely.  Definitely worth the  price.</li>
    <li> Really liked the product and I do see a difference in my skin. Will purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> I must admit, so far I love the serum. My skin feels good, and actually looks brighter. I will be ordering more in the future. I have been using it morning and night, and even my boyfriend has noticed a difference. Thank you so much!&lt;br /&gt;This product is one of the best I have ever tried.  It has dramatically brightened and softened my skin, with no sticky residue or sweet scent. It&#x27;s  simply wonderful AND the sales team members are so nice, you feel like you are purchasing from a friend. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I am a satisfied costumer. My face feels brand new again.&lt;br /&gt;I will for sure buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after watching the episode of Dr. Oz where he explained the benefits that Vitamin C has, and I am very glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product, it&#x27;s oil free and all natural and they make it super easy to apply because the cap is actually an eye-dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know what Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid(this product) can do for you, I&#x27;ll explain it:&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C can help to counteract wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C protects against and may repair UV damage like discoloration and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;It also helps your skin look and feel young, so i highly recommend this vitamin c sereum.</li>
    <li> I like it my skin feels softer and smoother, maybe alittle firmer.  will continue to use it in the morning and evening</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! The customer service is unbelievable.  As soon as I received the serum, I received additional iinstructions on how to best use the product. A thin layer is all you need as a foundation before applying a moisturizer or sun screen. I&#x27;ve only used it for one week and was not expecting any results this soon; however, my skin feels smoother already!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product 2 times now and will continue to purchase in future. I am very pleased with the product and the results I am seeing in my skin. Goes on great and not oily. A little goes a long way. Luv it !</li>
    <li> I have lots of wrinkles and lines in my face, but using this product days and nights many friends and even my wife have told that I look younger. Ithis product works. Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> My skin has improved markedly since I started using this. Customer service is excellent!</li>
    <li> I have been using TruSkin vit C for 4 weeks now, it did an awesome job on my skin. It is so moisturizing and also helps skin to brighten. I saw my laugh lines fade away... I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a brightening or anti aging serum....</li>
    <li> This is a very affordable Vitamin C with Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  It works great and it feels great when applied to your skin.  I use it as my moisturiser under my make up on my face and before I go to bed. I also use it on my dry elbows. It has improved my skin in just a week, decreasing the fine lines around my eyes and on my neck. Can&#x27;t wait to see results after a month of continued use.  I am wondering if they make a full body lotion.  I have heard that the combination of these to ingredients will tighten the skin under your arms as well.</li>
    <li> Great order fulfillment service. But more importantly, I&#x27;m really enjoying the product! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Found my skin much firmer and smoother just after two days of use as per instructions..</li>
    <li> Lovely application but seems to use up very quickly as it&#x27;s quite think. Prior vitamin c I used was thinner and lasted longer. I am using the recommended amount also.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave product feedback, but I&#x27;ve been so satisfied with this serum, I had to come back to share my thoughts.  I have sensitive, combination skin prone to allergic reactions, breakouts, and extreme dryness with the use of many common skincare products.  I&#x27;d heard about the benefits of hyaluronic acid, particularly in combination with vitamin C, for hydration, texture, and fine lines, and at age 36, I knew I&#x27;d likely benefit from it.  Because of the sensitivity of my skin, I sought out a natural product without the added chemicals which could trigger a skin reaction.  Based on the product description, this serum seemed perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use, I can honestly say the texture of my skin has noticeably improved.  While my skin has always been tight due to dryness, there&#x27;s now an underlying suppleness, likely due to the hyaluronic acid and its ability to draw water into the cells.  I&#x27;ve had absolutely no adverse skin reactions with this product; it absorbs quickly into the skin without any residual stickiness or fragrance, and it layers very well under my usual moisturizer without adding any bulk.  I&#x27;m quite impressed with this product and will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Love the serum, my skin is much brighter and softer. I apply it in the morning before my moisturizer and do the same thing at night. I now have my sister ready to buy it. Great product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.   It works immediately.   I  apply it in the mornings and the fine lines around my eyes just seem to  disappear. I also apply it before bed.  I am 57 and this stuff works.   And a bottle last a long time because it takes such a tiny amount to work.</li>
    <li> Very good product :-)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. The customer service is awesome. Taking time to check on customers progress goes beyond the average seller. I have seen a significant change in my skin tone and mild acne. I have also received compliments on my skin tone.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is AMAZING! I rarely write reviews, but this one was worth the time! I use this serum in the morning and in the evening, and after about a week of use I have seen a huge difference in the texture of my skin and my small freckles are almost nonexistent.  After price comparisons and review comparisons, I believe this is the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> The vitamin c serum seems to be working really well - thank you!  After washing&lt;br /&gt;my face and using some retinol cream, I use a few drops of the serum right&lt;br /&gt;before I go to bed.  It seems to have helped my skin a lot - less obvious eye&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles and my skin looks brighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love is that the serum is light and not heavy on my face, nor does it&lt;br /&gt;burn or irritate my eyes/skin. Also the fact that it&#x27;s all natural is a major&lt;br /&gt;plus :)</li>
    <li> I love the serum, it&#x27;s actually my first serum that I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my skin smooth and moisturized. I love the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Loving the serum! So glad I found this combination of C and hydraulic acid. Works beautifully on my combination skin!</li>
    <li> I can not say enough about this product!! I saw results within days. My skin is clearer and brighter and I am being asked by everyone what I am doing different.  I will be buying more of this right away.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product. I have very sensitive skin and was skeptical in using a serum due to it being too greasy  but it goes on beautifully and soaks in so well my skin feels and looks great.</li>
    <li> Smooth, radiant skin.  Pores are smaller. Blemishes are almost non-existent. When I do get a pimple, I am bad about squeezing and making a huge mark out of a tiny pimple....sometimes even scaring my face.. Not with this! If I squeeze a pimole at night, use this serum with my night lotion. ...GONE in the morning. I love this more than I can explain :-)</li>
    <li> I do love the healthy glow this gives my face.  My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid if my persistent dark/age spots, which is the whole reason I purchased it.  It is a nice feeling serum, not too thick or thin, it dries quickly, it doesn&#x27;t have any kind of smell to it, and it is colorless.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Everyone has been asking what I&#x27;ve done to my face. It&#x27;s smooth and soft, the wrinkles are minimal now. I would, and have highly recommended this to anyone who asks about it.</li>
    <li> Have not really noticed a difference using this product.  Probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Was looking to replace my Vitamin C Serum and came across this great brand! The reviews impressed me and so did the price so I had to try it out for myself. So glad I made the switch! What a great product...my skin is enjoying all the nourishment!  I&#x27;m seeing visible results in a short period of time and am Expecting even greater results over time.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product! Great Price! Make the switch... Your going to love your Vitamin C Serum from TruSkin Naturals!</li>
    <li> I am blown away at the serum.  I&#x27;ve used quite a few,  even pricier ones.  This has got to be my favorite so far.  The personal touch you get this company is unbeatable. Count me in as a repeat customer!  And sharing it with my girlfriends for sure!</li>
    <li> First bottle but seems to be working.  Absorbs good.</li>
    <li> Gives my skin a nice health glow</li>
    <li> I have discoloration on my face from sun damage since I grew up when we not only DIDN&#x27;T use sunscreen, we would slather on baby oil with iodine in it. My face looks really blotchy. I ordered this serum and after just the first use I could see a difference. I use as directed and wash my face first, then use the Vitamin C serum and then my usual moisturizer. I wish I would have taken before &amp; after pictures. I have seen a huge improvement after only three uses. After the first time of using this on my face, I decided to also use on my arms as I have a lot of dark spots and blotches, mostly from scrapes &amp; a bout of contact dermatitis. My arms look so much better already too, I am ready to take a bath in this stuff. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles for a 50yr old, but I am going to order their Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Retinol moisturizer. I was considering Dermabrasion or Laser therapy to make my skin look better but now I don&#x27;t need it, so this has saved me a lot of money!</li>
    <li> Excellent customer communication and satisfaction. Thank you so much!! The serum is working very nicely and I am pleased with the purchase. I will definitely continue using this product!!!</li>
    <li> i have tried so many products for my rocacea and nothing ever worked. This has worked really well for me!! My skin looks so much better by using this serum. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Made my face feel soft &amp; smoother after just a few days. So far I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I really like it - I have ordered more!</li>
    <li> My skin is smoother and my foundation goes on more evenly. I&#x27;m not sure I see much difference with the color! Tone of my skin, but at least my makeup goes on better. I only use it once per day as 2x seemed to cause my skin to breakout a little. I have very sensitive face skin. Once per day is perfect.</li>
    <li> I really love this serum..  I am using in in conjunction with the derma roller and the results have been amazing.  I have been using the roller every other week and the serum twice daily.  I have pretty substantial hyper pigmentation from pregnancy and sun exposure.  This duo is really working well to combat the issue.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Good price.</li>
    <li> My skin is looking great, and i&#x27;m hoping to get one for my girlfriend very soon.! This product has really helped.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product, I was not sure about it at first and gladly purchased it without knowing because the price was very good and reasonable! I have freckles and am always trying to get rid of them, this product really decreased the spots on my face and also tightens my face which helps with some fine lines I had around my eyes! I really recommend this product</li>
    <li> I’M TRYING SEVERAL PRODUCTS ‘AT THE SAME TIME’ ( HYLURONIC ACID PM BY THE ‘NOW’ COMPANY ) SO I REALLY WOULDN’T KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHICH PRODUCT IS WORKING WELL.  BUT I CAN SAY THIS, I’M 61 YRS. OLD AND I’M GETTING COMPLEMENTS FROM OTHER WOMEN MY AGE!!!  IT’S NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD’VE EXPECTED IN A MILLION YRS.!!!  ONE EXPERIENCE LAST WEEK, I MET WITH A LOAN OFFICER &amp; RIGHT OUT OF THE BLUE SHE SAYS TO ME “JANICE, YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.  IT’S RADIANT”!!!  A STRANGER SAID THIS TO ME!!!  I HAVE TO GIVE THIS PRODUCT SOME OF THE CREDIT!!  I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR &#x27;ANY&#x27; WOMAN, EVEN WITH SENSITIVE SKIN, AS I, MYSELF HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN.  IT&#x27;S AS THOUGH MY FACE &#x27;DRINKS&#x27; IT UP.  IT FEELS SO NICE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  JANICE</li>
    <li> Good stuff give a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently as directed 2x a day since I received it- a few weeks ago now. I&#x27;ve not noticed much of a change in my skin, besides it retaining more moisture. I feel the claims are overstated, such as reduction in pigmentation and pore size. I&#x27;ll keep using until I finish the bottle and will update my review.</li>
    <li> If you use C and E which it is hard to find at this price.&lt;br /&gt;It will help smooth out you fine lines and it is good for your skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Vitamin C Serum, and so does my face. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs into your skin without leaving any residue. I use it every night before my moisturizer. I will never be without this product!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with the TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum.  It is not what they claim or picture.  They picture a bottle with a clear liquid.  The bottle I received had liquid that was very runny and cloudy.  It made my face fill dried out and chalky!!  I have used Obagi 20 % Vitamin C Serum with GREAT results but it was very pricey.  I thought I would try this one because it had good reviews and a better price.  This serum looks like one that my husband made with a recipe he got on the internet.  The appearance is the same cloudy concoction.  If that is what I had wanted I could have used his mixture.  You can make it for pennies!!  But, it is not what I am looking for.  I was looking for a product when used makes your face feel baby soft, pink and new!!  This product does not do that.  For the money you spend it is a waist and not what others have raved about!!  I don&#x27;t think others who give good reviews have tried some really high quality Vitamin C Serum!!  I will be returning this product and buying the expensive one that I have tried before with great results!!  :(</li>
    <li> i used the whole bottle, twice a day and didnt noticed any change at all. The main reason why i bought it was to get rid of the sun spots. I didnt notice any change at all, even in the skin tone or healtier. nothing at all. i wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> One week, I saw such a difference.  Face feels smoother. Good Good</li>
    <li> 100% recommend this serum. Ive used this for a few weeks now &amp; I must say I absolutely love it!! Consistency is great &amp; the serum absorbs really well. I use it in the morning &amp; at night &amp; Ive noticed a big difference in the lines around my eyes, the texture of my skin.....I look more &#x27;refreshed&#x27; which, for someone in their mid 40&#x27;s is a bonus! Customer service is excellent, always ready to advise &amp; answer queries. Im now going to order my second bottle &amp; also try the hyaluronic acid &amp; retinol serum......excited for the results already!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using Vitamin C+E+Hyaluronic Acid Serum every morning for about two weeks and a few days ago my husband said my face was “glowing” (unprompted). For him to notice and remark on my skin means something drastic has changed! I can’t wait to see what other changes I notice in the appearance of my skin as I continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my dark spots after using it for a couple of month</li>
    <li> This one is clear with a slight medicinal scent. I think the scent may be the witch hazel. And while the scent isn&#x27;t unpleasant I don&#x27;t find it to be quite as nice as the previous one I tried with a scent of oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the included ingredients such as the high concentration of Vitamin C in addition to Vitamin E, Hyaluronic acid, Witch Hazel, Aloe, and Jojoba oil are either soothing (in the case of Witch Hazel and Jojoba oil or supposed to be anti-aging compounds. Hyaluronic acid is known to be able to retain a significant amount of water compared to its molecule size which is supposed to help keep more moisture in and around ones skin along with helping to minimize wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m told constantly (as in several times a week) that I look significantly younger than my age. The consensus from my peers and professors (in my college courses), the high school girls I&#x27;ve helped coach in gymnastics, and people in general I&#x27;ve gotten is that I look a good 7 years younger. Not that I&#x27;m complaining or anything, I just get a bit of a kick whenever I see a surprised look on people&#x27;s faces when I tell them my actual age. In the last 10 years or so my dad has also been told frequently that he looks younger than he is. It is a very good problem to have. That said, I&#x27;d like to take care of my skin to keep it looking young so I&#x27;m very interested in any anti-aging product. And as I have chronically dry skin all year round, I&#x27;m all for trying a serum that is supposed to help keep moisture in and around my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions for use state, &amp;#34;Wash and pat skin dry. If using a toner, apply toner first. Apply a small amount to entire face, neck, and decollete. Allow to dry. Follow with a moisturizer.&amp;#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed being able to use this serum (and ones like it) for the last 6 weeks or so. I do think I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in the unevenness of my skin tone. My skin is quite light, any redness or darkness (ie under the eyes)shows quite easily. Since I&#x27;ve been faithfully using this serum I&#x27;ve found my skin to have a bit less redness. I&#x27;ve gotten into using a lighter coverage foundation in recent months and find with less redness in my skin, I don&#x27;t particularly need to use a full coverage foundation. And with the weather here in So. Cal like being on a roller coaster (about 2 weeks ago, it was 100 degrees here, then 5 days later is was 65 degrees) ride, I find medium to full coverage foundations to &#x27;melt&#x27; off whereas the sheerer foundations stay put better.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  My skin is noticeably brighter.  This was my first TruSkin purchase and I plan to try more of their products.</li>
    <li> Noticed improvement in the texture of my skin after using this product.</li>
    <li> This serum really nourishes my skin and makes it glow!!! I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> My skin is looking better n better every week! I have only been using for three weeks my skin is glowing!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Very happy with product. Leaves facial skin soft and smooth looking. I&#x27;m hoping in time it will help fade my sun spots.</li>
    <li> Love this product.! I&#x27;ve seen improvement in the redness from my rosacea, the dark spots from sun damage and my broken capularies have faded and some have disappeared all together. I can&#x27;t afford expensive dermatology treatments and wasn&#x27;t happy with the way my skin was looking. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this, it really works! Can&#x27;t wait for my new bottle to arrive I ran out :(</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and having used another brand prior to this one I find TruSkin vitamin c serum to be easier to apply and more affordable than my last product.  As an older woman with very fair skin I&#x27;m concerned not only with appearance, but quality of facial products. I had a question for the company and had a quick and clear response. I highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I can see improvement in my overall skin tone. It is brighter and the fine lines around my mouth and eyes are smoother.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It is easy and quick to use. Put the serum on after cleansing morning and night, wait half a minute and then follow with a moisturiser and/or sunscreen. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed that is rarely mentioned in the promotion of the benefits of hyaluronic acid and vit. C, is it&#x27;s use on the back of the hands. Whatever serum I have left on my palm, after applying to my face, I spread over the backs of my hands, and it has also really made a visible difference there. I think the backs of the hands is an often neglected part and show signs of ageing as much as the face. What I find really off-putting are photos of celebrities, with their over-injected, plastic faces, and yet their hands are so awful and wrinkly! I was able to cancel a $500 botox injection for frown lines between my eyebrows by using this serum which is unbelievable value at $19.99.</li>
    <li> Love it!! A little but goes a long way. Since using it I have noticed that&#x27;s fine lines are fading. I have also put it on my neck, I have those horrible lines that I inherited, and they&#x27;re fading as well</li>
    <li> Like the product, like the feel and smell.  will probably again when it is all gone.</li>
    <li> This serum has made a difference in my skin. I use it in combination with the hyaluronic acid serum morning and night. I have sensitive skin and rosacea. The redness is gone and my pores are smaller and my skin feels softer and smoother.  I am so happy that I purchased this product.  I read the reviews on this product and others, and chose this one and I&#x27;m glad I did. I will be using this product for a long time!</li>
    <li> Tried this product because I heard good things about the mixture of ingredients but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin. I liked the bottle though.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the Vitamin C serum!! After using it for only one or two weeks, people have told me my face looks more bright and vibrant. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Started using this product a few weeks ago. Can already see a difference. My skin feels soft and fresh . I will continue to use this product. Customer service is awesome. The co- founder Erica sent instructions for use after I received the product and checked in a few days ago to see how it was working for me. Who does that anymore!!!! Great product, great company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vicky B</li>
    <li> Ive been loving it so far! I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month and Its soft and gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Its organic and the price is just right!</li>
    <li> I have been asked to update a review I submitted several months ago because I mistakenly sent that review to Seller Feedback.  In that review I stated that the products actually worked well and were reasonably priced.  I stand by that statement and have to add that I have been using the Vitamin C Serum (reordered), Hyaluronic Acid (reordered) and Retinol 2.5% (will reorder) for several months and could not be happier.  I live in the very dry high desert country of Northern Nevada and have been disappointed in many other (many more expensive) products.  I trust the TruSkin Naturals products completely.</li>
    <li> Really like this serum. Have tried many many big name products over the years and this seems far more effective. Glad I found it!</li>
    <li> I love the serum.  I’m using RetinA a few times a week at night, and an esthetician recommended I use a Vitamin C based product in the am, so that’s why I bought the serum.  I put a drop or two of lavender essential oil into the serum as this is calming to my skin.  It’s working great!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t see a difference</li>
    <li> its okay..fast shipment...don&#x27;t see any difference at all</li>
    <li> i like the way it makes my face glow in the morning... after wearing it all night get plenty of compliments</li>
    <li> I love this product,  and the company is fantastic.  They actually follow up with you to see how your product is working out for you.  I don&#x27;t know too many companies that do that.  I have been using the serum for 3 weeks now.  My skin is evenly toned,  healthier,  less break out,  and more youthful.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I never knew the benefits of Vitamin C for your face until I heard about TruSkin Naturals Serum. I asked a friend who is big into skincare because I have been having issues with blemishes at the age of 34. All she had to do was tell me &amp;#34;it has a lot of benefits&amp;#34;, then I did the rest of my research myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I loved purchasing this product on Amazon because the product description is very thorough and after researching, I found information located elsewhere on the web about the benefits of Vitamin C for your facial skin. The antioxidant benefits, the production of Collagen and Elastin, the release of dirt and oil, which helps to decrease blemishes, protection from harmful sun rays, inflammation and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After moving out the warehouse from an office position, I&#x27;m surrounded by dirt, but after I started using the Vitamin C Serum, I noticed that I haven&#x27;t had a blemish since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about this product is that it&#x27;s Made in the USA, with natural and organic ingredients in a cruelty-free, FDA registered, GMP certified facility. I was also very pleased with the way the product felt upon application. As it claims, the serum was not greasy, sticky or oily. The consistency was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin. Many products break me out. So I was very pleased when, after using it for almost a month, it did not break me out one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;ve also felt a difference in my skin elasticity. It seems firmer and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product for it&#x27;s benefits, the way it&#x27;s manufactured and it&#x27;s texture.</li>
    <li> So far, I am enjoying the serum.  My skin feels really good after I put it on and I hope to see even better results with fine lines and wrinkles after longer use. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased a product and had that company follow-up on my likes/dislikes about the product!  They even emailed tips on how to use the product to get the most benefit. Kudos to TruSkin Naturals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum day and night for about a month now. My hyperpigmentation has already begun to fade somewhat, and my smile lines are reduced. I use this in conjunction with a Clairsonic, Effaclar Face Wash, a dermaroller, and Vit C cream. I&#x27;m already getting compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! At first I really didn&#x27;t know if it made a difference and was a little hesitant on if I was just thinking I saw changes because I was &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to since it told me I would, but I&#x27;m not on my second bottle and have been using it for probably about six months now and can honestly say it does make a huge difference. I feel a lot more comfortable without make up now, it just makes my skin look a lot fresher and less blotchy. I highly recommend it! Plus, you get 50% off after your first bottle. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> I am 67 yrs old and strive to use natural products on my skin to avoid all the bad chemicals. I have been challenged finding ones that work until I found TruSkin Naturals. From the first time I used it I could tell a difference. My skin was firm and wrinkles diminished. I thought WOW !!! I have tried so many products for under eye puffiness and this vit c serum has helped the most of anything I have tried, so that was an extra plus. I love this serum. I ordered it because of so many positive reviews. Vit c is so important for collagen production so I am sooo happy I found this wonderful serum. I look forward to trying more of TruSkin Naturals products. Their pricing is fantastic also.</li>
    <li> Helps hydrate my face, it has also helped me with breakouts. I usually put it on in the morning and then a moisturizer on top. It REALLY helps with my bags under my eyes!! After I was my face I put a drop on my ringer fingers and gently massage them under and around my eyes and it helps reduce the puffiness around my skin, I let it dry for 15 minutes and then apply moisturizer or foundation. I would recommend to anyone who has bags under their eyes, it will not make them completely go away but does reduce the appearance of the puffiness somewhat. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use this product line but I have to admit I am really enjoying the product. I would recommend us</li>
    <li> I love it! My skin is soft more even toned. Around my eyes is brighter and less wrinkled. Will be getting more!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is helping my face yet but I seems like a good idea so I will keep using--time is not on my side to be fair to the serum</li>
    <li> I tried few other Vitamin C serums and this is the best one in comparison. My face look healthy and my skin is more elastic with some wrinkles started to disappear on my forehead. I think I will stick with this one for very long time.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this serum based on all the positive reviews and so far I reeeeallly love this serum! I am in my 30s and I wanted to try this to clear my skin up.  My skin is so smooth, soft and hydrated! I told my mom about this stuff and she ordered her a bottle!! I am a customer for life !!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;m 66 and see a marked improvement in my skin. I had a small area that would not clear up (a pimple at my age, but it&#x27;s true) after starting the vitamin c  serum it started healing right away.  I read all of the other reviews and it help make up my mind.  I&#x27;m so glad I did, I&#x27;ll continue to use it and help my skin stay as young as it can.  Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I already take great care of my skin, so I did not see any dramatic results from this serum. It is a good price and does a satisfactory job of pulling your skin taught, but it also tends to peel and flake unless you use a moisturizer over it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking my serum! I am seeing gradual results and am excited to see even more results the longer I use it. I just recently referred a friend to this serum and she bought some as well. I&#x27;ll definitely order more!&lt;br /&gt;I love how it goes on and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily. My face absorbs it well.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is outstanding!!  That says a lot about a company and how well they stand behind their product.</li>
    <li> I really like this vitamin c serum. My face feels so hydrated and nourished after using it. I like that it dries quickly and does not feel at all oily. I also like that it is alcohol and paraben free and full of great natural and organic ingredients. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to keep their face looking youthful.</li>
    <li> There is some glue on the bottle :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other serums, but I like this one the best. It has a nice texture and dries quickly, so I can apply moisturizer within minutes. My face stays smooth all day as a result. I highly recommend this product for users who might have Rosacea (which is what I have). I follow up with a sensitive skin moisturizer, which seems to work best.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C is the best ever!!! I love, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a thick serum with some very helpful ingredients. It adds softness to my skin without any irritation. Just purchased my second one, I think I am a regular now!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality and customer service. The aloe in it makes it very soothing and moisturizing. Doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out the skin. Seems to be great for sensitive skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I am happy to say that I love love love this stuff! I was super skeptical because most products all promise amazing results. I can tell you that this serum is legit and I will happily buy many more bottles if I can get the deal like I found on amazon. I sure can&#x27;t afford the marketing value. I have also decided that it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll buy my female family members this Christmas. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a brighter complexion, less noticeable fine lines, and an overall refreshed look! I&#x27;m glad I tried this stuff out! God bless!</li>
    <li> I do notice a big difference with this serum. My skin is tighter, less prone to acne and all around smoother. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I had some blemishes and discoloration on my face, some from acne and some from living in sunny areas for most of my life. Being almost 40, I started to get fine lines and a few wrinkles. I was never really into using the typical name brand facial creames and lotions. I was lucky enough to find this product, and I am truly glad that I did! As I use it, my face is softer and I can see some of the blemishes beginning to fade. It is also helping to smoothe out some of the fine wrinkles as well. The serum is lightly scented, which is a huge bonus for me! I don&#x27;t like smelling like I&#x27;ve been dipped into a vat of synthetic flowers. I was also pleased with how little I actually need to use on my face and neck. This bottle will list me quite a while, so I know I will get my money&#x27;s worth, which, again, is a huge plus. I can honestly say that I am going to purchase this serum again.</li>
    <li> Broke out in small bumps. I am sure it works for some but not for me. And also it was really overheated when I got it in the mail since it is summertime and it was almost boiling so I am not sure the product was even good when I put it on my face. Maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work for me. But some vitamin C products do fine on my skin so I guess I will stick to my other cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have discovered this! It really does help my skin. I have the unfortunate habit of picking at my acne, and this serum helps me recover.</li>
    <li> The serum is working beautifully as it seems to really diminish the fine lines and smooth out my face.  A little like ironing - it smooths everything out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  writing to let you all know my eperience; so far so good, my skin is more radiant, even toned,and youthful,I&#x27;m  a 56 year old looking 45 thank you for your product. ..</li>
    <li> My skin feels great since I started using TruSkin Naturals Serum about 2 months ago. My breakouts have cleared up also. My skin is looking bright and flawless. My face has greatly improved and I am very glad I tried it :). I am very satisfied and will continue to order more.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use it every day before bedtime and I wake up with my face soft and bright. Is like a therapy!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t reach my expectation. I am not satisfied about the fact that it will brighten your face. I had used 15% vitamin c serum few years back and that was a product of India , that did real miracle to my face. But this one not. I felt some moisturizing effect on my face, that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this product but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> I really like the serum and can see a difference in the look of my skin.  I have rosacea and I believe that the redness has lessened.  Great company!  Will definitely buy from again!</li>
    <li> Works well on my skin and I have very sensitive skin that can easily breakout with the wrong product. You can actually feel the skin tighten after application. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> good quality and good price.</li>
    <li> Love how this organic vitamin C serum makes my face feel. I use it with TruSkin Hyaluronic Acid serum and the Retional serum. My skin is looking much better and I&#x27;ve only used it for two weeks!</li>
    <li> I could see a difference in my dark spots after the 2nd week.  You&#x27;re skin will feel so soft and smooth after the 1st application.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great serum and works well under makeup</li>
    <li> I am new to this routine and I am 68 and have issues around my lips particularly.  I would get the botox, but I am a wimp and cheap. So am trying this. It is actually making a visable difference. Seriously it is. I did not expect it, but for the product price I thought why not.  I have used Serious Skin Care C line for years (and love) but HSN is expensive, does not provide this combo, and charges a ridiculous amount for shipping.  So I tried this. Now I have reorder 2 bottles....obviously I am impressed. Give it a good try....at least use at least 1 bottle on a target area and check before and after.  My issues had been around for years, so any improvement is a direct result of this product and there is significant improvement. It this is all there is....I am happy enough.  Try it. Service could not have been better</li>
    <li> So far it works really good.  Thanx a lot.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I see a difference in my skin in just after a week.  My skin is so much softer already, and I&#x27;m beginning to see a difference in my small wrinkles.  I highly recommend this product -- and I don&#x27;t do many reviews, but this Serum is great!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m using this product everyday.</li>
    <li> Received it fast. Well packed. Just started using so I cannot say that works miracles but noticed some brightness in my face skin ... What I like the most is the excellent customer service .  They provide the right directions which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I love the serums I&#x27;ve purchased from Truskin. The C serum in particular has made dramatic improvements in my skin in the three months that I&#x27;ve been using the product.  My skin has improved in clarity, tone, and feels softer snd smoother.</li>
    <li> I like that fact that it is made from organic ingredients. After using it for first few days, my skin looked smoother, and it wasn&#x27;t only me who noticed it. People noticed that also, saying &amp;#34;your skin looks so fresh, and radiant, what are you using?&amp;#34; So, I told them about this product. And, I like the affordable price on Amazon, as well! I will be buying more for sure.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate in skin care!  Along with a healthy diet and lots of water, the best thing to put on your skin is Vitamin C!  And this product has 20% of it along with other completely natural ingredients.  I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C serum before from other brands and this is by far the best one yet!  It&#x27;s the ultimate in age reversal.  It does not oxidize or change texture with use like some other products.  I still keep it stored in the refrigerator because i like the cooling feeling when i use it.  Overall it basically shrinks your pores and evens your skin tone and makes brown spots fade completely.  I use this in conjuction with their Retinol serum and combined they&#x27;ve made my skin super smooth and soft with no breakouts (oh yea, if you have breakouts Vitamin C will zap them very fast and prevent new ones from coming). And if you have oily skin, this will balance out your skin and make it normal!  It makes me have less need for foundation!  Which is amazing in itself that i can just use a bit of powder and go!  Amazing product from an amazing company.  I&#x27;m going to stock up on this because now that i like it, i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll get discontinued.  LOL  Hope not!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I really like the serum so far! Seems like my skin is smoother since I started using it. My pores seem to not be as noticeable either. I&#x27;ll keep you posted as I continue to use it :)</li>
    <li> This serum has been a wonderful additional to my daily routine.  Skin looks and feels so soft and healthy. Excellent costumer service!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for this AMAZING product!!! The VERY first application I was impressed with the feeling and texture of the product and not to mention the GLOW you get. I have DRY skin and I felt the hydrating right away so I &#x27;am a Happy new and forever customer. Later that day a friend of mine came over and I just had to show &amp; tell my Best Organic Vitamin C Serum. She also has dry skin so she washed &amp; applied the serum and was impressed as well because her skin is usually dry but after 1 application she noticed hydration</li>
    <li> almost done with the bottle and have not seen any difference.</li>
    <li> happy with the product</li>
    <li> I received the product right on time.  I used it for the first time last night, followed the instructions as directed and my face looked so bright and healthy this morning.  If this is just the beginning, I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more improvement I&#x27;ll see.  After cleansing with my Cerave Hydrating lotion, I applied this serum, let it dry for about 2 minutes then I put my Cerave Moisturizing lotion.  I can already see the results and I like them.  This TruSkin Vitamin C serum is high quality.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It seemed to make a difference to my face almost immediately.  I&#x27;ve already ordered another bottle.  Delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> This serum, although I haven&#x27;t been using it for more than a couple of weeks, leaves my skin soft, and I think my skin looks a bit more refined.  You need just a few drops, followed by your moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t notice any real evidence of firming, but I thinkmy skin looks brighter.  Worth a try!</li>
    <li> I really like it so far.  My skin feels great and a few sun spots appear to have lightened a bit.  The fact that I have gone without make-up a few days and not felt as self-conscious is a testament to it making a difference.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference already. First of all it absorbs very fast. Does not burn my skin as most of the serums do. It makes my dark spots from the sun disappear. The most important is my forehead does not shine any more by the end of the day. I have combinated skin dry in the morning, oily on the afternoon. So it looks like it is controlling my shine in the afternoon even with such heat outside. I am very happy with the product, thinking to order the hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this at first because I was having an outbreak of Rosacea and was afraid it would it would sting.  This is not only gentle but also effective.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave a sticky residue.  My brown spots are slowly starting to fade and I am very pleased with this purchase.  Also, their customer service is wonderful.</li>
    <li> An excellent product. My skin is soft and radiant. I had to let all my friends in on my &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;My 56 year old skin never looked better!</li>
    <li> I love, love this serum! I have seen a difference in my skin.  I have sensitive skin and this works well with it. I will definitely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I really like the TruSkin Naturals serum. My skin is noticeably brighter and more even. I like the fact that it dries without a residue and it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my moisturizer or makeup. I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40ish and I had been noticing that my face was dryer than normal.  I haven&#x27;t changed my diet, nor am I on any prescription meds, we are on city water of which the ph is checked often and it&#x27;s in normal range; however my skin was dryer. So I know that as we get older the metabolic sides of our body tend to slow down.  So I attribute this dryness to this life change.  I started searching for a B3 product and came across an abundance of positive reviews for this product. So I ordered it and the first day that I got it, I used it and I noticed a dramatic change in my skins texture after three days of use.  The dryness is gone, the pores are smaller, and the skin feels so soft. My skin actually looks healthier. In addition, I am not using any other products on my skin.</li>
    <li> I use Best Vitamin C Serum for Face with Hyaluronic Acid with 20% Vitamin C combined with Phyto-ceramides  350mg; 30 plant derived liquid softgels.  I heard about this combination by a plastic surgeon on the Dr. Oz show.</li>
    <li> I extremely happy with this serum and just after a couple weeks can see a difference in my skin. The best part is the fact that I am not allergic to it. I have very sensitive skin and have used some products that sent me to ER. I have had no reaction to this serum, even using it on the delicate neck and chest. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have already noticed a difference in my skin after only 2 weeks! It is smoother and my adult acne has diminished. My pores also appear to be smaller. Being able to use the product around my eyes is also a plus. Will update you later on those results! I will reorder...</li>
    <li> I really like this product and now have ordered the Hyaluronic Acid, they both are gentle on my skin and really seem to be working as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this Vit. C serum multiple times. I&#x27;m 65 years old and am not unrealistic in my expectations. But I&#x27;m persistent in pursuing the best options for keeping skin aging at bay as long as I can. I&#x27;ve done a good job over the years - using high quality skincare for over 20 years. I&#x27;ve used both SkinCeuticals Vit. C and Perricone Vitamin C. At some point, I stopped using a Vit. C product because i wasn&#x27;t convinced it was necessary - and I am all about trying new products recommended to me. So, I&#x27;ve been on a journey looking for my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t live without&amp;#34; anti-aging products. Currently, I&#x27;m using NeoCutis and having decent results but I always think it could be better.... That said - I&#x27;ve been doing more research on Vit. C and decided to put it back into my regimen. But here&#x27;s the deal. After using TruSkin Naturals for about 5 months now - maybe 6 - and really, really loving the price - I&#x27;ve mostly seen a reduced appearance of pores. That&#x27;s good - but I have not seen any change in lines, wrinkles, or dark spots. In fact, i have new lines, wrinkles, and dark spots since using it. This only tells me that there is no real miracle product. I&#x27;ve had the most anti-aging results from laser treatments in the past. I just can&#x27;t afford them right now. That said, I struggle with many of the Amazon-promoted Vit. C products that are in the organic category and that are in the $20 price range - because I look at these products and they have 1600 - 2000 positive reviews - all singing the praises of the product and sounding suspiciously alike. Whereas, other more expensive, well-known products like Perricone or Skinceuticals have around 12 - 25 mixed reviews. I think this is an okay product. I like the way my skin looks immediately after I put it on my face. However, through the course of the day, my dry skin looks drier at the end of the day. And that part I don&#x27;t like. Do I think it&#x27;s worth the 20 bucks? Yep.</li>
    <li> I love my serum, it works great.! I love it.!!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to all the women that want the extra protection and makes your skin feel refreshed and young..!!</li>
    <li> This WORKS. The product arrived in tact, well packaged and this was friendly and prompt service. My skin calmed down instantly and stopped aging and I can already see and feel the difference in smoothness, less irritation and overall more plumped up. So thank you!</li>
    <li> I love it - and I also love the Hyaluronic Acid in the separate bottle - I use the C in the a.m and Hyaluronic in the pm - I am getting so many people commenting on how great my skin looks ---- will definitely re-order both..</li>
    <li> One day &#x3D; my skin feels so  much smoother!!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this serum. I could tell from the first application that my face was appreciating the ingredients. Add exceptional customer follow-up (they truly are) and you&#x27;ve got a company and product I plan to stay with.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a Vitamin C serum that would give me a skin-brightening boost and this serum does not disappoint. The added benefit of being a combo product and having hyaluronic acid as the second ingredient made this a no brainer purchase. I am happy with the results so far and know that with continued use the benefits will continue to show over time. Glad I made this purchase! Not to mention, the personalized service from the founder is a bonus. Thanks Erica.</li>
    <li> This serum makes my face and neck feel so soft and definitely a lot less wrinkles!</li>
    <li> This is the best skin care item I have purchased in a long time and I&#x27;ve been trying many of them. Helps improve texture of skin, clears up everything from wrinkles to dark spots. I have never written a review before but felt compelled to write one about this serum. This stuff is great!</li>
    <li> I have been happy so far with the serum, I can tell a difference in my skin feeling smoother. I also rub what is left on my hands on the back of my hands. I use it morning and night. I previously bought a different vitamin c serum (can’t remember the name) and thought it was too watery and didn’t see a big difference in the way my skin looked. I would purchase TruSkin Naturals BEST Vitamin C Serum again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product. I notice my face smoothing and starting to even out ny complexion. The serum is light with a pleasant scent, so easy to apply on ny face. I&#x27;ve gradually increase to applying mornings and evening.  Good product</li>
    <li> I really love this serum, it works great and is affordable. A must for anyone looking to fill in fine lines, fade sun spots, and boost collagen. I have really enjoyed using this serum.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Immediately noticed improvement.  My skin looks healthier and lines diminished already.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product and will be ordering it regularly. It&#x27;s great for my skin. I can see and feel the difference. Excellent customer service as well.</li>
    <li> I really love the products. My skin tone and texture really improved! I will also be purchasing the huyaloiric acid for extra plumping!!!</li>
    <li> Results are inmediate! My skin looks and feels soft and hydrated. Fine lines are gone!</li>
    <li> Hands down for this vitamin C product!.. I love it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work waste of money</li>
    <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m throwing everything else out of my bathroom carbinate! I have Malasma and used this for 2 weeks now. I see a difference in my skins brightness and feel. It was delivered in time for my Vegas trip and took it with me in that 115 degree weather that lasted my entire trip from June 26th to July 1st. This product really made a difference!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Really happy with this C Serum. My skin looks and feels better than it has since I was in my 20&#x27;s. Loooonnnng time ago!! I use a Vitamin C facial wash, then apply TruSkin C. Then use Josie Maran Argan Oil as a moisturizer, at night only. It has made my skin so smooth, clear. Customer service is the best. Great people. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C for a couple of weeks now with their other products. And my skin looks bright and smooth.Very happy.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I started using the Vitamin C serum a few weeks ago and have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. The dark circles under my eyes have faded as well as my acne scars!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the customer service is fantastic!! I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Left my skin feeling firmer and super soft. Love it! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This serum is really great  It tightens your skin and has vitamins C &amp; E in it which really helps improve the texture of your skin. I have shopped around and this does so much more than the real expensive serums</li>
    <li> I love this product and buy it every month or so.  I have noticed a difference in the texture of my over 60 skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is fairly priced compared to similar products on the market, it goes on very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell like others I have tried, and is very nutritious for the skin.  Vit C and E is so important in skin care!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Seems to be a good product and good company.</li>
    <li> Good product.  I used this up and then bought another one which I do not like at all (at least so far I don&#x27;t).  Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Hands down the BEST skin care serum I have ever tried! My skin has never looked smoother, pores smaller, and even my complexion has gotten brighter. I will continue to use this product for LIFE ! Also LOVE buying from this company- they have the BEST customer service and genuinely care about customer satisfaction!</li>
    <li> This is truly an amazing product! It is gentle, restoring, and effective. I have sensitive, allergy and eczema prone skin, and have been able to use this product morning and night with no evidence of skin irritation.  After 2 days of use I noticed a difference in the skin under my eyes, which is what sent me in search of a product that could help. Skin became tighter, less stressed, and more naturally colored. Dark circles and tiny lines were noticeably improved. After one week of use, I am using  less concealer, and on some days, just using mascara and a little lip gloss. I can be a little lazy in my makeup routine, and not scare friends and family with 50-year-old bags of dark skin under my eyes!  I feel confident and refreshed.  I would highly recommend this product to all my aging sisters out there!  For me, it was highly worth the cost to even try the product, and even more worth it to see immediate results fighting signs of aging and fatigue. &#x27;Truly and amazing find; and I am so grateful!</li>
    <li> My review is negative because it took so long for the product to arrive. My first order was refunded because it didn&#x27;t show up and I had to re-order. Doesn&#x27;t seen to do a thing and is quite drying. I have a 12% vitamin C serum that seems to be better than this.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum just over two weeks now and so far I really like the results of my skin.  It totally makes my skin softer and I feel like it has helped with fine lines and skin tone. I felt it was a good price for this product so I will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> So far I like the product. I got it mainly because I have little bits of sun marks in my face and overall my face feels younger and fresh! To the point that I just don&#x27;t want to wear make up anymore!&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this to my mom. She is always using facial products and I believe this will help her with the wrinkles that she so much dislikes!</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It is very easy to use and feels really good on your skin.  You just use a few drops and smooth it on your&lt;br /&gt;skin - it absorbs very easily.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for less than a month and have already noticed a smoother skin and glow.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next couple of weeks.  I plan on using this product for at least 6 months to see the full results.</li>
    <li> My skin is much brighter. I am older with genetically dry skin.  I do take good care of it, but haven&#x27;t used Vit C serum previously. I will continue to use it. I don&#x27;t like skin care products with fragrance. After purchasing I was contacted and appreciate it as it reflects  concern and interest in making sure the consumer&#x27;s expectation are met and marketing information is aligning with those expectations.</li>
    <li> I wish they&#x27;d sell this in 55 gallon drums so I can submerge my whole body in it :)  I&#x27;ve noticed that my 56 year-old skin is brighter with a little bit of a glow.  Seems a little smoother, too.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  Plan to use it forever if it&#x27;s it available.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Glass bottle was a plus. Prefer a higher viscosity, felt it was a bit too watery. Did not notice too much of a difference.</li>
    <li> This has been a wonderful addition to my facial routine.  My face looks younger.  When having a facial, I was told my face is very hydrated and my skin looked great.  A year ago, I was told how dry my skin was and given lots of recommendations for improvement.  Not anymore thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> When I went for my last facial, the technician asked me what I had been doing to my face,because my skin looked and felt so good!  It was because of the Vitamin C Serum!  I also started using it on my hands.  I am a 63 year old Zumba instructor competing in a world of young instuctors, so looking good is important to me.  This is the best!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks now and I am seeing a tightness of my skin and a reduction of lines around my mouth. My pores are smaller and the skin around my chin and neck has tightened. I am very happy with this serum.</li>
    <li> Company has great customer service. Excited to use this product.</li>
    <li> JUST came in this morning, and I am in loooove!! I am 24, don&#x27;t have heavy lines, but do have a light crease on my forehead.  First I exfoliated with a 100% charcoal charged facial sponge, pat dry. Applied organic apple cider vinegar as my toner, this product, and Juice Beauty oil treatment as my moisture.  And WOW, line is gone. No exaggerations. I&#x27;m all about fantastic skin care, and make my own at home.  Done a TON of reading/research.  This product is definitely on my top. Big thumbs up! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My skin looks and feels so soft and supple. I would recommend to any one, any age.  I wish there was an &amp;#34;all-body&amp;#34; product that could produce the same results.</li>
    <li> I come into agreement with what everyone else is saying about how wonderful this product is!! I&#x27;m so thankful i landed on this Vitamin C serum!!  I love the fact that it is power packed with essential nutrients to replenish my skin, providing deep nourishment and suppleness.  My face positively glows after i&#x27;ve applied it. And i appreciate the fact that i am putting natural ingredients on my skin!  Huge bonus:))</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clearing up my acne scars. I really like it. I notice I have a brighter skin tone as well. I will definitely keep using it!!!</li>
    <li> I just started my second bottle of this serum and I&#x27;m loving it! My face got visibly brighter and I dodn&#x27;t have to spend too much time applying makeup. Just got 2 bottles for my sister too.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for just a couple of weeks and notice some improvement.  I am 68 years old so that is a big plus.  I have sensitive skin and so far have no signs of redress.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great  product.  My skin improved after week and a half of using it. Love how easily it absorbed into my skin. Non greasy.</li>
    <li> A little does go a long way.  Have been using for a few weeks.  Softer skin and have to use less lotion on my face.  I use morning and night.  Love the product!</li>
    <li> This product is great. My skin is already smoother and softer to the touch just after a few uses. Can&#x27;t wait to see results from continued long term use. Thanks for awesome products and great customer service!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!!!! I am 56 years old with oily skin/big pores and this has helped to minimize those pores and make my skin look smoother and feel softer without adding extra oil. I will definitely continue to use this and recommend this to my friends.  I want to thank you too for offering a great product at an affordable price. This makes it easier to have good skin care. The customer service and follow up is also OUTSTANDING!!.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks. It is so easy to spread on my skin. I can already see my skin looks a bit brighter and smoother. It soaks in very quickly. It has not clogged my pores. I love it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived timely and securely packaged and I LOVE THIS SERUM!  It works perfectly, feels great and the smell is awesome.  Would definitely buy again!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have used about 4 different vitamin C serums over the past year, giving each one 2-4 months to work on my skin. I have sensitive, acne prone skin, with scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best product I found was NU2, but the prkce is awful. This product works well. It evens skin tone, keeps fine lines at bay, and the price is excellent. The only complaint I have is the somewhat sticky consistency, but I believe that is only due to the aloe and not a big deal. I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple weeks now and I have already seen a change. My acne scars seem to be slightly changing. Which I hope if I continue to keep using it, it will disappear the best it can. I do love the way it makes my face feel. After using it a couple of times, I did feel a difference of softness to my skin. I don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough to notice any diminishing of fine lines and wrinkles.  But it already has made a difference for the short amount of time I have been using it. So far I like it a lot. I hope over time as I continue to use this product I will start noticing significant results.</li>
    <li> I am writing this review after using the Vitamin C serum for 2 months.  It is light-weighted and absorbed very quickly, not greasy at all. I feel my skin is full and moist instantly. But don&#x27;t expect it is long lasting as it is not for moisture keeping. You need to apply moisture serum if necessary.  I can&#x27;t tell if it can reduce the fine lines as I only have a few. But it does work on brightening. It helps even my skin tone and make my skin looking more radiant. My face didn&#x27;t get dark after a full day exposure under the sun, while my arms and legs did a lot.  I will keep using it and see if it will help on refining the skin texture.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent serum. My face looks great after using this for several weeks.</li>
    <li> this serum is fantastic i use it nightly under my usual moisturizer and so far i can see a big difference in my skin (i&#x27;ve been using it consistently for about two weeks now). my skin feels smoother and i am seeing a big reduction in breakouts. i will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This serum was okay but did not do anything special to my face. It took me a while to understand the right amount to apply because if you apply a little too much it will come off like glues when rubbed, which is not pleasant at all. I found it pretty difficult to put on BB cream or make up on top it, so I stopped using it in morning and used only at night.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be repeating.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well for me. I have seen no skin texture improvement so far. I like how it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin sticky or greasy though.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It works, but it still takes time. My skin feel smoother and the dark spots are faded. I also purchased Hyaluronic Acid Serum after I found this Vitamin C Serum works for me. I highly recommend it for anyone have a dry skin like mine. Even my friends recognized the change on my skin :D&lt;br /&gt;They have a really good service too. I really love it &amp;#60;3. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product! My skin looks more polished and feels smoother. Great addition to my routine. Chose it above others for being USA made and not tested on animals in addition to formula description. And, for anyone who enjoys great customer service know that this company actually cares about their products after they&#x27;ve made it into your routine.  Co-founder contacted me to ask my opinion on the product and I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it was to speak with an actual human being rather than receive some manufactured survey or rating request.  Great job TruSkin Naturals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 47 year old African American with dark circles and hyper-pigmentation. My previously combination/oily skin has dry patches. I&#x27;ve been using TruSkin Naturals Best Organic Vitamin C Serum for almost 6 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen some good results. The hyper-pigmentation has faded enough that I am using less concealer under my foundation. If things continue to progress, I can imagine not needing concealer at all for the hyper-pigmentation. Unfortunately, my dark circles remain with no change but I think that&#x27;s more a result of health issues than the product. A nice bonus is that the pores on my nose and cheeks are smaller, less noticeable. As for the dry patches, they actually got a little worse and began to itch. Overall, I think my skin&#x27;s texture looks better, smoother and I think the product itself has done a really good job. I&#x27;d rate the product at 4.5 stars. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the dryness and itching. Here&#x27;s where I break my review into 2 parts: 1st part product, 2nd part customer service. TruSkin contacted me to ask about my experience with the product and to offer assistance. They didn&#x27;t, like so many other companies, just ask me for a review. I appreciated this since I&#x27;ve never written a review--until now. This is my first. I explained my issues and they were very helpful. In fact, the dryness issue is very much improved with the help of another of their wonderful products, the TruSkin Naturals Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Their customer service is about the best I&#x27;ve ever experienced and I work in customer service. I wish I worked for a company that backed their product with this kind of support. So combining the product with the customer service, I give it a total of 5 stars. But honestly, the customer service is so far above the rest, it&#x27;s really off the charts.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from the price I paid, but within the first couple of days of receiving the serum, I started noticing a difference. The results will probably vary with each person, but for me, it made my skin healthier looking all over - brighter, if you will. It also appears a little more firm and I have only used it about 5 times. I plan to purchase the hyaluronic acid serum next and see how the C and that, work together.    All in all, I love this product and plan to stick with this company. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s, by the way. :)</li>
    <li> did not notice a diff. If you want something that works immediately try any bobbi brown skin care product</li>
    <li> I have been using the product faithfully on my sensitive skin and do love the results so far.  I like that it is light and not perfumed.  And, I little goes a long way.  I also have been putting it on my neck &amp; chest.</li>
    <li> I read an ad for an expensive skin product which contained both hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C. I decided to go on Amazon.com and look for those same ingredients. I found them in this product at a fraction of the cost of the one I saw in the ad. I absolutely LOVE it! I started using it about a month ago and I could feel the softness in my skin in less than a week. Some of my more noticible dark spots (at 67 I don&#x27;t like to call them &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots...lol) started lightening in just a week or so and have been getting less and less noticible as I keep using it twice a day. I put it on right after I shower in the evening and then I put it on again when I get dressed in the morning. The serum goes on so easily and absorbs perfectly without any residue or heaviness. I tried so many of those skin creams advertised on TV and almost every one of them felt like a layer of the product was left on my skin. I also love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to keep a pile of bottles and tubes on my dresser now....just this one product by TruSkin Naturals is all I&#x27;ll need. Thanks so much for a great product and for creating it without all those artificial and chemical ingredients in most of the other products use. I LOVE it and so does my skin! :)</li>
    <li> I have been impressed by not only the serum but by the customer service I must say! The owner of the company actually emailed me to see how I liked the serum! Does anyone do that anymore???So far I have really had a good reaction to the serum. My skin looks really good. My routine is spritz with a toner day and night and after it dries a bit to add the serum. Not really using a face cream right now with this routine. So far so good! Everybody&#x27;s face is different but It is definitely worth trying, no tightness or stinging and my face looks better than ever and it such a reasonably priced serum!</li>
    <li> Short review, it is a really good product.  Skin is noticeably softer and looks better.  I’ll be buying more and recommending it to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long review:&lt;br /&gt;Gotta preface this review, I&#x27;m one of these guys that never used sunblock or any type of lotion before.  It wasn&#x27;t till I noticed all my friends at the same age as me looking &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; and started getting sunspots.  I looked in the mirror more closely and I saw that I was starting to show my age too.  Jumped online and I started looking into skin products, particularly for my face.  After doing my research, vitamins C and E for the day and maybe even the evening.  Vitamin A only at night before going to sleep.  I decided to just use C and A for a while since research showed those had given the most results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did pick a single company for both vitamin C and A (for a guy that never bought skin creams before, pretty expensive!).  Noticed skin was starting to look (less discolorations) and feel better (softer and smoother), but at some point there were no longer Prime suppliers for my vitamin C!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I looked for other brands that brought me to Truskin for my fix lol.  So at the same volume, this is what i get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. Explicitly stated amount of vitamin C I&#x27;m getting.  Other brand did not show this.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Includes vitamin E, other brand does not have it&lt;br /&gt;  3. Almost half the price of the product I was using before&lt;br /&gt;  4. Tinted glass bottle (clear bottle from other product, use to be a non-tranluscent white bottle but I guess their marketing department thinks the clear one looks &amp;#34;sexier&amp;#34;) that I would think prevents oxidization&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great, my skin continues to improve and I will definitely recommend to friends and family!  Plus I save some money and get more in return &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this serum!! I&#x27;m 41 years old and have suffered from adult acne since my early 20&#x27;s. For the first time in my life, my skin is clear without having to use prescription treatments. My skin is so smooth and soft. I also have sun damage and my skin definitely looks more even. One of my friends, who happens to be 10 years younger than me, said my skin was glowing last week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other vitamin c serums (and lots of other skin care products) and while I liked them, I didn&#x27;t love them. This one, I love! I like that it has hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil, so it helps my moisturizer to absorb better. I like that it is gentle enough to use around my eyes. I can see a huge change in the fine lines around my eyes as a result. I also like that it seems more stable than other serums that I have used. One brand I tried would oxidize and turn brown before I could finish the bottle. I also love the price, very affordable!&lt;br /&gt;And I must say that I am so impressed by your customer service!!! It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really think of any dislikes.</li>
    <li> I guess I wanted a better product</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vit. C Serum for about 2 weeks now and have noticed a big difference in my skin. My skin looks smoother. I have scars from acne and am diligently using it on those areas. Like I said, my skin looks smoother, fresher and clearer. I highly recommend this product and can hardly wait to try their other products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I was looking for a vitamin C serum and saw this one rated 5 stars so I figured I would give it a try. So happy I did! It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and I have noticed an improvement already in my skin tone and texture. I have a tendency to have redness on my face and this has made such a difference! I also love that it provides a great base before makeup without any oily or greasy feeling on the skin as it absorbs quickly. I have just ordered my 3rd bottle because I don&#x27;t want to run out! I also have to say the customer service is excellent . I know I will be a customer for a long time to come and hope other people who are looking for a Vitamin C serum will give this one a try!</li>
    <li> product just as described fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I can say it goes on smoothly and leaves no stickiness.  I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love it! So far, so good! Have not had any breakouts since I started using the serum. I got Botox for the first time four weeks ago and the nurse practitioner is the one who told me to start using a Vitamin C Serum in conjunction with a facial sunscreen(using EltaMD), then my moisturizer, then foundation. My skin has been really smooth and I tend to be really dry, which it helps with that as well!</li>
    <li> I love skin care products and I decided to give it a try after reading all of the wonderful reviews. I am not exagerrating when I tell you I noticed a difference the morning after the first night I used it. My face looked vibrant. Even though I&#x27;m fair-skinned, I looked brighter and more awake. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can vouch for some of the uses of this serum. I was afraid that, after being out in the sun for an hour without sunblock, I would not be able to tell if the serum was working because my face would be all red from sunburn. I am very fair skinned and burn easily. A half hour in direct sun will usually leave me with a little color. To my surprise, I did not have any sunburn on my face! I had been using the serum for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that general redness and uneven skin tone slowly disappeared. I feel like I can see my face again!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I saw a difference within days!  I had dry wart looking spots ony face and they are gone.</li>
    <li> The serum has been working for me. I can see clearer skin and it just looks brighter in general. So far there isn&#x27;t anything I dislike... but I do like the feeling of it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for around a month.I started out using it 1x per day, and worked up to 2x as per the suggestions. I have not noticed any dramatic results in wrinkles. I did read that the change can take 2-3 months to take effect, so I will certainly update my review as needed. I will say that my husband complimented that my skin looked more radiant (and he was unaware that I had started using this) within 1-2 weeks of me using it. The serum does not provide much moisture, so I would recommend following it&#x27;s application with a regular moisturizer. Overall, the serum glides onto your skin easily and it dries in about 5 seconds. It does not leave a sticky residue as some serums do.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help improve my skin but instead it caused break-outs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is WONDERFULLLLL!! I was skeptical at first when I read ALL that it was good for, but it is all true, my husband is now using it &amp; have 2 friends on it just from them seeing my results after just a few weeks....there is no bad side to this, it absolutely does all it claims to do. And another great bonus is that the company genuinely cares about their customers...so rare now a days!! :-)</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel soft but did not see any other changes</li>
    <li> It does what it claims to do. It was worth my &amp;#34;investment.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I did not like it and will not be reordering. I don&#x27;t get the same feel that I like in Skin Ceuticals (sp?) which is more $ but worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used for almost a week.I like the way it makes my face feel and look.</li>
    <li> After using the Serum for just over a month my husband commented on how good my skin was looking! That says it all as he never even notices when I get a haircut. I experienced excellent customer service from the Best Organic people also.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I bought it to replace another, much more expensive serum, and I prefer it in every way. It absorbs instantly, feels light on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t cause new breakouts. Skin feels nice and soft. It&#x27;s gentler than what I&#x27;d been using, and smells better as well. I also like the eyedropper applicator, which lets me control how much I use.</li>
    <li> Ok~ I don&#x27;t normally write reviews yet, I recently started using TruSkin Naturals and I&#x27;m HOOKED.  Yes, I&#x27;m a guy and it works well in smoothing out lines and it goes on very well.  I&#x27;m getting close to 50 and  don&#x27;t look it.  With TruSkin Naturals, I will continue to improve my skin tone &amp; clear age spots on the way. I&#x27;ll continue to update you with results.  :) Tomas F.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic, and delivered visible results within 1-3 days of use. My die-hard, no cosmetics, no chemicals husband who is used to extremely high quality organic skin care products, has noticed such a difference already and is seriously considering using this serum as well- that&#x27;s a serious endorsement. We also love the fact that TruSkin is an authentic, all American company &amp; their product line is manufactured &amp; adheres to our strictest of standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality &amp; results are amazing-thank you all @ Truskin for creating this line!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with TruSkin Vitamin C serum.  I noticed a new glow in my skin after using for just one week.  The serum absorbs quickly and there is no greasy feeling to the touch.  I would highly recommend TruSkin Vitamin C Serum.  I also appreciate Erica&#x27;s great customer service!</li>
    <li> I am loving the serum, especially how it makes my skin feel.. I am very satisfied and will be ordering more in the near future. Go order your Vitamin C serum you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> This product is such crap and it smells rancid! I had 2 bottles of this, both smelled the same both gave the same results--&amp;#62;NADA!  I fell for all hype generated through these reviews. I am beginning to question if majority of them are even real? Seems sketchy to me...</li>
    <li> I love love love this product hands down the best product I&#x27;ve ever used and I won&#x27;t stop buying it until they stop making it ❤️❤️ it has not only brightened my skin but my dark marks too!!! I use it under my daily sunscreen day and night 😁</li>
    <li> Really happy that I bought this product! It makes such a huge difference, my face looks so much more toned and healthy almost glowing I absolutely love it, I use it everyday. In my opinion it also does calm any irritated acne. I get a few breakouts and this really helps. I&#x27;m definitely purchasing this product again I just wish it was a bigger bottle. Not to mention the customer service that comes along with this product is so great! They check in on you and see how the product is working for you, it really makes the product that much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using it every day once or twice for about a month now. I bought it because i have dark spots in my face and i can see already a little bit of difference.  I think they are fading.  I know it takes a while for them to lighten up so i am planning on using the serum for 3 months to see clear results. I do love that the serum dries pretty quickly so it doesn&#x27;t take forever to do my face care routine.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have received a follow up from the company asking me how I liked the product, how was it working, if I disliked anything about it. This is the first time that I purchased something and I had such a personalized/caring experience. I will definitelly recommend this product and the company to all of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Great service and great product!</li>
    <li> My skin feels so smooth, tighter and my freckles got even lighter after I start using your serum.  I usually put on the serum after my evening shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about your serum is thickness not like other serum I used before in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will continue buying your product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the serum. My skin feels a lot more hydrated, soft, and has brightened considerably.  Truly amazing stuff. I ordered the other serum, I&#x27;m hoping between the two to have super results.   I got this just over two weeks ago and have been using it twice a day, morning and at night.  I have a lot of acne scarring and my facial skin was just blotchy and dull.  Since I started using this, along with apple cider vinegar as a toner,  my scarring is fading remarkably quickly.  This leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  My husband, who usually notices nothing, even commented and said how great my face was looking and he can see what my true complexion is.  As a result, I&#x27;m using a lot less foundation makeup.  I hope they never change this formula!</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft and smooth now after using this serum for 2 weeks. And the wrinkle isn&#x27;t obvious any more. My friend is amazed those changes. So far I am very satisfied with the result and for many years I used another brand with very high prices but result was not obvious. So I decided from now on I change serum to TruSkin.</li>
    <li> it simply doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother and looks brighter. I had an appointment with my dermatologist on Wednesday and she said my skin looked better!</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic!!!! It clears my breakout scars, evens out my skin tone...I put it on before going to bed and notice the improvement EVERY DAY! It is the best serum in the world! If you have sensitive, acne prone skin...don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;ll only improve your skin!!!</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for over 3 weeks now and love it! It&#x27;s Summer and even with sunscreen, my face gets dry. This serum is soothing and my skin looks so much better. Also, I have been very impressed with the customer service of this company. Awesome product, awesome company!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t given it enough time to grade the effects on my face.  I have been receiving emails for a review and frankly I have &amp;#34;nutt&#x27;in&amp;#34; for ya at the moment.  I will update when I know more.</li>
    <li> Works great...got rid of 2 sun scars and dork spots on my face in 2 weeks...I already ordered more to have because makes my skin look great...I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> just try it. it is ok.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! I have been using it for 2weeks now and i&#x27;m loving the result! and i think my acne scar are fading...i only take 3 drops and its good for my entire face, i will surely buy it again.!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure the ingredients will be beneficial, but I had a problem - I had a couple breakouts on my cheek, and I don&#x27;t normally break out. Maybe the vitamin C concentration is just too high for me.  I&#x27;m over 50.  I do like the consistency but the addition of the witch hazel is a bit drying and might be a concern for those over the age of 50 like me.    On another note, the customer service is fabulous!</li>
    <li> Been using it, not noticing any difference</li>
    <li> Been using two months and lines are a little less.</li>
    <li> TruSkin is improving the overall texture of my skin and giving my face a nice glow.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum for both day/night and since incorporating into my daily routine, have seen a pronounced improvement in skin&#x27;s tone and texture - I have always had good skin, but since using have had far more compliments than usual and friend&#x27;s rushing to buy!  Customer service at TruSkin is top notch and a pleasure dealing with.  I won&#x27;t ever be without this product now!!!</li>
    <li> This product has done nothing for me.  I&#x27;m going to try to return the product.</li>
    <li> This product is everything, it feels so good once you apply it on your face you feel the difference immediately. I recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 weeks. I do like it because my face is VERY sensitive and I must be careful of the type of product I use. I have not experienced any breakout with this product and it does make my skin feel great. I take vitamin C every day for the inside of my body and it does good things for me so why not use it on the outside?!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Switched from Proactive routine and this combined with the sponge and the witch hazel astringent is so much better for my 54 year old skin. Thanks for making such a good affordable product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really good! Go&#x27;s on smooth and dry&#x27;s fast!  It smoothed and soften out my skin and it looks more even toned  I&#x27;ve used it twice a day, morning and night for 4 months now and will keep on ordering! Thanks TruSkin Naturals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for about a week, but I&#x27;ve seen very good results already! I was concerned about the ingredient list, so I emailed the manufacturer and got a detailed list right away. My skin, which it&#x27;s normally very sensitive and had been dry and flaky, seems firmer and softer and isn&#x27;t flaky any more. I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been usingTruSkin Naturals Best Vitamin C Serum. For face withhyaluronic Acid 20% for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m just so happy that I finally get what I&#x27;ve been looking for in terms of naturals for a long time! That product is so amazing and gives me back the confidence I secretly  lost these last years. My dark spots are all gone  noticebly and I have such a radiant and beautiful skin that I&#x27;m so proud of myself and want to recommend that to every of my relatives who have issues getting a good skin on their face.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is amazing and the price is right. I&#x27;ve used PCA C-Quench which is around $75 and I feel like the TruSkin serum isn&#x27;t as drying! I have been using it for around a month and I can already see improvement in my fine lines and the overall pigment of my skin.  A representative even contacted me to find out how it was working and answered questions that I had regarding use. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Best Vit C serum I have found.  My skin is so much less dry,less wrinkled. I am 65 &amp; even on days of little sleep my skin looks great. Love how it goes on, fabulous stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My skin is so soft and not dry anymore. I will continue to use this product and will surely recommend it to my friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> Just started using the serum and so far so great! I love the way it goes on and feels on the face. I recommend this for everyone including men!</li>
    <li> Best C I have tried!!!</li>
    <li> WHAT IS IN THIS STUFF!!  I bought it for my husband, and after a week you can REALLY notice a change.  I mean be realistic, it doesn&#x27;t knock off 20 years, but I would say 6-8 years for sure!  His skin is smoother and vibrant.  No kidding.  I use a prescription-product, but maybe I will give this a shot too!  Can&#x27;t have him looking younger than me!</li>
    <li> I have noticed dark areas/spots have lightened significantly. I like the product and will reorder when needed. Good product. Good price. Good service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle...and I quite satisfied with the product! I noticed a difference on my skin ever since I started using it. Highly recommended! Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get incredible results, as reviewers have been raving about this product. I have hyper pigmentation on my face and I use the entire Shiseido brightening line of skin care. Shiseido is expensive, so when I saw reviewers stating that their hyper pigmentation and spots had improved after using this serum, I was hoping to switch over to it. After 4 days of using the serum I began to break out badly all over my nose and upper lip. I continued to use the serum for another couple weeks hoping that my skin would improve, but the break outs became progressively worse. I went back to using Shiseido and my skin cleared immediately.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth. Isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy. I have relatively young skin so I can&#x27;t say it has removed any wrinkles or age spots but I&#x27;m hoping it will prevent them! I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and my skin is much brighter.</li>
    <li> I liked your product. My skin is softer and it hasn&#x27;t caused any type of irritation considering I have very sensitive skin. I also like how it absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn&#x27;t have any sticky or greasy feeling. Great product especially since the ingredients are natural and not chemical.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality. It is not common to receive a product which quality surpases the advertised one. Really neat!</li>
    <li> Is compatible with other serum products I have.  Would recommend.  Bought second bottle. Works well and nice consistency.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, drys fast, non sticky, and along with the retinol I feel they may work well together, but may need a little longer than a month for the results I am looking for.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really do anything but feels nice.</li>
    <li> I am VERY pleased with the TruSkin Organic Vitamin C Serum product. I purchased it mainly for use on an age spot on my face and, after only a few uses, I can already see the dark spot diminishing. I have used countless other products with no results after months of use. I also started using the TruSkin serum on my neck and have noticed smoother, softer-looking skin. It&#x27;s amazing! Plus, the customer service is awesome! I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this vitamin C serum from TruSkin Naturals for a little over three weeks now and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results so far.  I have lots of sun damage on my face (I was a sun worshipper in my younger days) which shows in dark spots on both sides of my face.  I&#x27;ve tried many different things and nothing has worked until now.  They were noticeably lighter in a week and continue to fade.  I could not be more pleased!  My skin was dull, large pores, plus brown spots.  The overall difference in my appearance is simply amazing.  Also by the way, the customer service is exceptional.  I love online shopping on Amazon, but am always a little unsure about what to expect if a problem should arise.  Well, I can tell you this, I have never received such prompt, personal service as I did from this company.  I cannot recommend them highly enough. Tru Skin vitamin C serum is a great product and I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> So far very pleased with this product I have oily sensitive skin and it had been great it got rid of some small pimples on my forehead almost right away over night and my skin seems clearer and healthier only been one week but love it so far!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel a lot hydration or tingling when I put on this product. I will finish the the bottle and see is I see some result and maybe purchase another one. I was also wonder if there was another Products that this company made</li>
    <li> I enjoyed it so much that I ordered more. My skin is drinking it up. I am finding my skin to be more vibrant. I noticed it even more when I am not getting as much sleep as I should, my skin doesn&#x27;t look tired. Yahoo!</li>
    <li> There are two things that made me fall in love with this product....the customer service and the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 26 years young so i didn&#x27;t get this product for diminishing wrinkles or fine lines, I did get it for minimizing my old acne scars and prevention of fine lines and wrinkles for the future.&lt;br /&gt;I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin in the sense that i break out if one little thing is off about the product, that always makes me cautious to try new things...but based on customer reviews and it being all natural, I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS NEVER ONCE MADE ME BREAK OUT OR IRRITATE MY SKIN. It has faded my old acne scars and evened out skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I use a 3 step acne system (Glytone...that&#x27;s a seperate review but you can find that product also on Amazon.It&#x27;s made my acne go away and given me CLEAR SKIN! and i&#x27;ve suffered with acne all my LIFE.) ANYWAYS, I use the serum between toner and medicated acne lotion.Erica, from customer service, told me that The serum acts as a delivery system for other ingredients, so it actually helps my skin absorb the ingredients from my other products better...JUST AN EXTRA TIP. It is a great product and highly recommending you purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to mention how wonderful Erica has been in checking up on my results via e-mail and showing me that she truly cares and stands behind this product. She was so happy to hear of my results that she SENT ME A BRAND NEW BOTTLE absolutely&lt;br /&gt;FREE!! I truly appreciated that and have to make mention of my exceptional experience with this AMAZON store.&lt;br /&gt;So if you get an email form anyone escpecially Erica, she truly cares and wants to help with any questions or concerns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be coming back for more when my complimentary bottle runs out! Thanks Erica!</li>
    <li> I have been noticing an improvement in my skin since using it twice a day.  It has nice dewy glow now.  I&#x27;ve also been getting a lot of compliments on my skin too. Twice a day seems to make a big difference. I&#x27;m a customer forever!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and its customer service.  I received an email making sure I received my product from Erica and another one asking me how I was liking the product - Now that is customer service you don&#x27;t see much these days anymore!  I just use the eyedropper and drop a couple drops on my finger tips, rub together and apply. A little bit goes a long way. Within two weeks I have noticed that the fine wrinkles around my eyes are looking much less noticeable.The age spot on my hand is lightening up too. I am noticing a tighter, firmer, smoother look to my face which I like the most. I actually look bright and rested. I will definitely continue to buy TruSkin Naturals serum. I am pleased with the results and their customer service is fantastic!</li>
    <li> My skin look great, I have been using the vitamin C serum every night since  I received it on March 6. The Vitamin C serum is light and a little goes a long way.  I like it, my skin is smooth, soft with an even skin tone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an older gal (67) who still won&#x27;t go out without her makeup! My skin is starting to wrinkle and I&#x27;m trying everything that comes around! So far so good! I use this serum followed by Hyaluronic Acid morning and night. Looking better....now if only I didn&#x27;t have to smile or frown, these pesky wrinkles might go away!</li>
    <li> Too expensive for what it is. Seller offered refund and was good to work with. The serum does seem to work. Just too pricey.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin C Serum. I am 64 years old and there has been a noticeable improvement to the smoothness of my skin, reduction of fine wrinkles, and as an extra bonus a natural glow. Makes sense as vitamin C is a natural product...so good for us inside and out!</li>
    <li> After less than one month of applying TruSkin Naturals, I am receiving more kind compliments about my complexion than I would have  dreamed! My skin feels smoother and softer to touch and looks clearer than it has in several years. I am so pleased that I found TruSkin Naturals after a long search for a product that was comprised of natural ingredients, that was affordably priced and also had favorable customer reviews.  Most of all, I am very impressed that while TruSkin Naturals is very effective, it is also gentle enough for my rather sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product which makes my skin brighter. I will continue to use it for crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
    <li> It really makes a difference, you see it right away! Gets rid of dark circles. &amp;it&#x27;s REALLY natural. I know because I used a few &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and they all gave me reactions... This one left my skin beautiful and no redness. Really great product and Great Seller&#x3D;). My mom used a few times also and saw a difference right away. Great Product that will make a difference in your skin naturally</li>
    <li> I will tell you that I have spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on creams and by far this Vitamin C serum is my favorite. I feel and see results without the “oily” feeling some lotions and creams leave.  I am now starting to see those “aging” lines and my pores are more noticeable, and with this serum I feel like it makes a noticeable difference especially with my pores and lines..  My husband even mentioned that my skin looks great, with no clue that I was doing something different with it.  We live in a dry climate here in the high desert mountain elevation so dryness can age you if you let it.  This serum seems to plump my skin, makes it glow and feels soft.  This was noticed immediately.  I am also amazed at how affordable the price is. I would highly recommend this product to my friends and family.  I am so tickled to have found this for such an affordable price.  Bye bye Lancome!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the way this product works and with this company&#x27;s genuine respect for their customer.  I have noticeably softer and smoother skin with using this product once a day for the past 2 weeks.  I plan to begin using it twice a day for even better results.  I also feel great about using a product that uses only the necessary ingredients and doesn&#x27;t use preservatives, parabens and sulfates nor tests on animals.  TruSkin truly stands by their product and takes the time to ensure you are satisfied.  I would highly recommend this product as well this brand.</li>
    <li> AWESOME IN COMBINATION WITH THE TRIPLE VITAMIN C SERUM.</li>
    <li> really great product. It is made from natural materials so there is no smell of it. It is white and pure, which makes my skin smooth and brilliant.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My skin is so soft and smooth now. I love it.  I use it on the back side of my hands as well.</li>
    <li> WOW! I am 60 years old with the beginnings of crepe paper skin. I used the Vitamin C serum for 3 Days and noticed a difference in my face...even my esthetician noticed the difference. My face is remarkably smoother, no post menopausal breakouts, and skin is firmer! I emailed the company for a recommendation  for a moisturizer and I received a response the same day! IMPRESSIVE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed an improvement in my skin! It&#x27;s more smooth and even toned, and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts (and I have sensitive skin). Customer service is also amazing, couldn&#x27;t be happier with my experience!</li>
    <li> I am addicted.  I have tried chemical peels and all kinds of exfoliating scrubs. I am a 37 year old female with dark spots, acne spots that drive me crazy. Nothing has worked and most of the time products for my thin aging skin is too harsh and end up either burning my skin or breaking me out. I can use this anytime, as many times during the day as I want, over or under makeup and my skin just drinks it up.  It&#x27;s never too harsh and best of all my spots are disappearing.  Unfortunately I have adult acne but this product has also helped minimize that too. I love it, cannot get enough of it.  I freaked out when I realized I was running low so I just ordered my second bottle.  I am hoping it&#x27;s delivered before I run out.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! My skin has never looked better. I use it morning and night after cleansing my face. My skin looks very radiant.  Less breakouts, fine lines, and my dark spots are fading. I would highly recommend this product. The customer service was amazing. After a week, I was contacted to see how I liked the product. Awesome customer service! I will most certainly order this product again. Very good value for the price! GET IT!!!</li>
    <li> I love oils and these are great</li>
    <li> So far I love the Vitamin C serum!  I noticed a change in my skin tone after two days of morning and evening use.  I am almost 60 and have several trouble spots on my face that appeared to show reduced redness after using the serum.  I am keeping an eye on my brown spots to see if they diminish after longer use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Vitamin C serum so much that after two days I immediately ordered another bottle for myself and one for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the product great, my experience with the the company behind the product has been exceptional.  I am not exaggerating!  TruSkin Naturals communicates personally with their customers.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Serum for approximately 3 weeks and I have noticed an overall improvement.  The sagging skin over my eyes has lifted somewhat and my neck area appears tighter. The product is reasonably priced and the reviews for the most part were positive so I had to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The Serum has no odor or greasy feel.  I use one dropper morning and evening and that covers my face and neck.  Once applied I let it dry and then moisturize.  I like the fact that I can use it around my eye area and there&#x27;s no irritation.  A good product at a good price.........</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for the last six months.  I love it.  I have used much more expensive brands, and this brand is definitely as good as the &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; brand, if not better.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  It makes my skin feel wonderful and it gives it a great even tone.  I am totally hooked!</li>
    <li> I love the Vit C Serum, then ordered the Hyaluronic Acid and the Retinol 2.%%.  I use all three and they have done&lt;br /&gt;wonders for my skin.  They also have a tightening sensation that lets me know they&#x27;re working......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different C serums and they always broke me out because it irritated my sensitive skin.  They were high end products so I almost gave up when I did some research and came upon TruSkin.  I am very happy to say this does not irritate my sensitive skin and my daughter noticed how bright my skin looked over Skype, which means a lot since the camera is not the most flattering.  It also made my dark spots lighter which was why I bought the product. I use it along with a retinol serum.  It&#x27;s not from TruSkin, but because of the results I got from their vitamin C serum, I will be purchasing the retinol serum as well.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the right vitamin c serum for a while, but most came with a hefty price tag - this product is priced extremely well, so i figured it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as the others - i was completely wrong! this rivals any other serum out there. I received my order very quickly and started using it right away, both morning and night. I have acne and scars so I was a little worried about swapping this with my blemish serum but i am happy i did. I received an email from Erica, the Co-Founder on tips on how to use the product efficiently and my feedback, which was such a nice touch. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin looks great. My acne has decreased considerably, pores are smaller, my skin looks brighter and more even. The consistency is great, not sticky or thick, goes on and absorbs well. Even my makeup goes on nicer. This is definitely worth trying and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Works wonders. After one day of using this, I actually saw a difference. Try using under a good moisturizer like Olay total effects, the effects are actually pretty amazing. I had laugh lines and some scarring and within a week or so my laugh lines were disappearing and my skin was glowing. The price is pretty good also. Definitely worth it. Just remember to screw on the cover all the way after using because if you forget it will spill out. Overall, I love it!! Can&#x27;t really say enough good things. The people at TruSkins naturals are actually quite amazing also. They really want their product to work which is a really nice quality in a business. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered another bottle because I didn&#x27;t want to be without it.  My skin is starting to have a slight glow and my face and neck feel hydrated.  The lines around my eyes have decrease.  I have been using this product for over three weeks.  I&#x27;m 55 and at this point I feel with regular use and patience I will only see more results in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using TruSkin Naturals Best Vitamin C for a few months now. I think it&#x27;s slowly helping with my dark spots and preventing Melasma; and it is about the only safe treatment I can use during pregnancy. Great value and customer service. I&#x27;m really glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD VITAMIN C SERUM.</li>
    <li> so far I am loving this product. My skin feels soft and my face is glowing. I bought this specifically to help lighten my age spots and acne scars. They have not faded however it&#x27;s too soon to tell I will keep using this for a few months</li>
    <li> use it every day love it</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for a couple of weeks now and have noticed that my skin seems to be glowing and&lt;br /&gt;fine lines and wrinkles look diminished.  I am impressed with the results that I have achieved so far and will continue to use&lt;br /&gt;this product.  This seems to be working better than the serums that I have been paying around $100 for from a major&lt;br /&gt;beauty line that begins with an L.  Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! My mum and I saw improvements within the first week. My mum is 74 and has some sun damage from over exposure in Africa. The serum is clearing this away in a gentle manner. She is quite fussy about products - she won&#x27;t use any bleaching or whitening hydroquinone products but has not seen much improvements from various expensive creams either. This serum was the perfect solution for her. As for me, my face is looking younger, brighter and tighter. I don&#x27;t even need make up ie foundation or concealers, I just use eye pencils and gloss. Several folks have asked me what products I use. Last but not least, this company has excellent customer service. Very impressive.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using it twice daily, morning and night and my skin is feeling softer and with softer skin, tinted moisturizer seems to apply more smoothly. It’s only been a little while but I am hoping it will lighten up my sun spots. I have olive skin tone and the years of sun worship from my youth has started catching up to me but overall, I am pleased with the results and looking forward to seeing more improvements. Will update again in a couple months.....</li>
    <li> I just love it when I have a lot of skincare to share with all of you because I know how important it is to look the best that you can these days. Not that I am trying to fool anyone into thinking I am 15 or so years younger, I just want to look my best for me and for my husband. Otherwise, I really don&#x27;t think I run around a lot of the time with no makeup or &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; as he calls it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new serum has 20% Vitamin C which is a lot unless you built your skin up on lower doses and gradually increased it like I did. I had no problems with this strength but I have been doing skin care way before anyone was even concerned about Vitamin C. This particular Vitamin C also has Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid in the serum to really give it a big boost in helping us ladies keep those smiling faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to hear that they do not use alcohol or parabens in their products so that was a relief! They use natural and organic ingredients and never test their products on animals. It was actually kind of cool to know that they us a concentrated base of vegan hyaluronic acid to make this one of the most effective Vitamin C serum&#x27;s today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And these are the things that are most important to me, the dark circles under my eyes because I have such awful sleeping habits now. With the RA and the Fibromyalgia constantly knocking on my door, I am sleepy and tired all the time but half of the time when I try to lay down, my mind is going a mile a minute and I can&#x27;t go to sleep and so I loose a lot of sleep. Of course, if that happens too many days in a row, when I do crash, I crash for about 2 days straight and you might as well not expect to see me during those times nor do I answer the phone (although most of the time I don&#x27;t even hear it).some&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sure would love it if some of these ingredients would work on the joints to relieve the pain but I guess no such luck, huh? It is amazing to me that researchers can find multiple products to help with our outward appearance but no one wants to be in pain and look horrible, so I guess as long as I can cling to one, the other will have to bide it&#x27;s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with the sticky part because I have tried products that will leave your face with a sticky or heavy feel to it and it drives me absolutely insane. I wonder why some of them do and some don&#x27;t? I can also tell you I have tried a few brands that made me itch or irritated my skin and that is one thing I won&#x27;t tolerate. I can tolerate the sticky feeling but not when I start feeling like my face is burning. I immediately go and wash all of it off and never use the product again or give it away. I know we all have different types of skin so the product might be great for their skin but creates havoc on mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you will be truly amazed at what a good quality Vitamin C Serum can do for you. I have known this secret for a long time and always try to keep a bottle handy because it&#x27;s one of the few luxuries I do allow myself. I may not be able to afford all the fancy stuff that rich people do, but at least for my age and my health situation right now, I think I look pretty darn good and so does my husband and that is really all that counts!lp with our outward appearance but no one wants to be in pain and look horrible, so I guess as long as I can cling to one, the other will have to bide it&#x27;s time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with the sticky part because I have tried products that will leave your face with a sticky or heavy feel to it and it drives me absolutely insane.

    <li> I love this stuff. I could tell that my face is brighter in less than a week of using it. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Great product, does not irritate my eczema.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my serum. I&#x27;ve told many people to order it.  I use it twice a day and my skin is smoother, healthier looking and it just feels great.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel or residue after I apply it. I have used serums in the past that do and it makes applying makeup a challenge.  I LOVE my serum.

    <li> Have been using now about 3 weeks took some time but I  have notice in the this past week now some change in my skin and love the way makeup applies more smoothly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed , thank u guys .</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It has evened out the tone of my skin,shrunk my pores,softened the texture as well as it even gave a glow to my skin.I will absolutely be ordering another bottle!!</li>
    <li> Received product in timely manner. I have combination skin and can be oily escpecially in the summer. Product goes on smoothly, not a hint of shine and dries quickly. Will definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the serum.  I like the consistency and the results are almost instant and can see a difference in my skin.  I am really enjoying the product and will definitely look into other products in your line.</li>
    <li> I just turned 40 and have had break out skin since my 20&#x27;s. First, I am a real reviewer that has purchased this serum. I had never used any Vitamin C serum ever. I love the consistency of the serum, it penetrates into my skin within 20 minutes and DOES NOT leave any sticky residue. Moisturizer and make-up go on smoothly. I also like the smell which has no fragrance but a natural and organic scent that makes you feel like you are putting something great on your skin every time. Does not make me break out and I have found it actually HELPS with my breakouts (that&#x27;s a plus)! Before I used the serum my face was looking very Dull which made me purchase this product based on the reviews and price and I also invested in a really good moisturizer that does not make me break out as well. After using this C serum for 3 weeks now my face now has a healthy and dewey glow that I did not have before. I am super excited and will continue to use this product. Also know their customer service is EXCEPTIONAL!</li>
    <li> I like this product, spots are fading,and the surface is smother.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well and I like it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> i decided to buy it because many ppl said that the product is good,however after using it,I&#x27;m alleged to it ,my face turn red look really terrible, 😭😭😪😥😰😓😢</li>
    <li> on my second bottle and it actually seems to be working on my dark spots.  they are not gone but there is some fading which is better than anything I have tried to date, and that has been a lot of products.</li>
    <li> Mrs. C here. I had sun spots all over my nose and cheeks, a few on my forehead. Only a week or two of use and the spots are very noticeably lighter. I looked at myself in the mirror one morning and thought...I look different. Then I realized it was because all those spots were gone. I even look different with my foundation on... one nice even color across my face.  A few darker spots do remain.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any change in my wife&#x27;s face.  It is a daily use item.</li>
    <li> I Love it! It feels great on my skin and it makes my skin look better. I wear it day and night.  Thank You very much!</li>
    <li> Just started using it... Yet to finish my first pack..so far so good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a week now and I think it&#x27;s making a difference. My skin looks like it&#x27;s blooming and it seems firmer. I&#x27;ve used other C/hyaluronic serums in the past and I think yours works better than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for about 2 weeks both morning and night.  I am just  noticing a difference in my skin.  It stays hydrated longer and is looking brighter already.  I got a compliment on my skin just yesterday while shopping in ULTA.  And another at my son&#x27;s doctor&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;I am loving your product.</li>
    <li> Your vitamin C serum works great. I have applied it twice a day and everyday.</li>
    <li> The product is great! I have had acne for more than 20 years. In that time, I have done everything from antibiotics, chemical peels, prescription soaps/creams, two Fraxel laser treatments, microdermabrasion, retin-A, etc. What has worked better than all of that is scrubbing with a washcloth and water and then putting on TruSkin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C for going on 3 weeks. Already my skin feels smoother and has a lil glow to it. My skin was not bad to begin with but starting to develop a few wrinkles across the forehead and eyes. Wrinkles seem to be looking better. I have had a couple people tell me that my skin looks brighter as if I was pregnant. For some reason during pregnancy my skin tone evens out and has a nice brightness to it. It goes on smoothly and my skin soaks it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking for Vitamin C after reading that it helps the skin keep its youthful look along with Hyaluronic acid. I researched on amazon and found several Vitamin C products and read through tons of comments. Your product was picked because of the satisfied customers and also for customer service. Now I can see why. I am very satisfied with both. If you are on the fence about this product, Give it a try. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin, and didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Serum seems to be working , slowly, but surely. I see my hyperpigmentation on my face fading/receding just a tiny bit. I believe I should have great results within the next couple of months. I have no complaints about the serum.</li>
    <li> Tightens the skin. No smell. Not sure if it lightens sunspots though. Will wait another month or when bottle is finished but so far I like it a lot!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using true skin C for two weeks and have noticed the deference. My skin looks more softer and younger looking. With recommended 100% love it.</li>
    <li> Tighten the skin which is great no break out.</li>
    <li> I had recently read on webmd that vitamin c serum can really help with fine lines and wrinkles. So I got a sample from a friend and bought some at Ulta and tried them out with no success. Then I had again been reading in a magazine that stated vitamin c serum was really good for your skin yada yada....so I thought well I will go see what amazon has and found TruSkin vitamin c serum. The reviews where good and there was a lot of detail in the product information and the price point is reasonable. So I thought what the heck I will try it.... Well I am glad I did. I have noticed a huge difference in my crows feet and fine lines right under my eyes. I have been using it for about a month. I have extremely sensitive skin and this eye serum has no strong scent or perfumes and is not stinging on the skin. I have tried everything for eye creams; Olay, Estée Lauder, Meaningfull Beauty, Mary Kay, etc and have not found the results that I have received from this product. I am 41 years, have sun damage and was a previous smoker so my skin is damaged!  I feel that it is being repaired with this vitamin serum and couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> Best serum ever, I order it twice and will order it again, the customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just a few weeks into using this product but I can already see some results, softer skin, a nice healthy glow with no peeling.  The price is amazing for a 20% Vit C product!</li>
    <li> It really helps. But don&#x27;t have lingo to describe it. Mostly it cleans my&lt;br /&gt;skin and lessens age spots.</li>
    <li> Extraordinary product! I used product 5x more expensive in the past and the results in a few weeks of TruSkin Naturals surpasses months of Skin Ceuticals. I have seen the benefits in fine lines, age spots and overall luminous glow. I highly recommend the Vitamin C Serum for your face, neck and décolletage.</li>
    <li> I have been using your products (both the Vitamin C Serum &amp; the Hyaluronic Acid) religiously for the past month, at least once a day, typically twice a day.  My skin is very dry and I also get bouts of Rosacea (for which I take no medication).  Since using your product I have notice that my skin is slightly softer.  But, more importantly, the redness is almost gone.  I am hoping with continued use that my skin tone will even out more, and perhaps, it may help the dark circles under my eyes (hereditary).  These are slight changes but I am not expecting miracles, especially in such a short time frame.    I like the product and will continue to use it at this point.</li>
    <li> Made my skin softer but there is  no change in the wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long you are to use it before you notice a change I have been using it for 5 weeks</li>
    <li> I just received this product and absolutely love the immediate results. I am a 58 year, woman who has tried many skin products over the last 35 years. I have always been complimented on my youthful complexion, with my focus on sunscreen and moisturizers. Even with a consistent skincare program, I do have fine wrinkles and a few deep wrinkles. This serum instantly make the fine wrinkles appear smaller. I haven&#x27;t notice significant change of  the deeper wrinkles, yet, but I have only used it twice so far.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the optimum results with longer use!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  I have used it morning and night for a couple of weeks now and I am very pleased with the results.  Under eye area is firmer and my wrinkles are looking better as well.  Wonderful customer support from the company!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a great price.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  I had previously purchased just hyaluronic acid and it was nice but it&#x27;s better with vitamin c.  I bought another vit c/hyaluronic acid serum before this but it looked and felt exactly like the plain hyaluronic acid at a much higher price and was Ina clear bottle.  This is in a dark bottle, as it should be, because vitamin c deteriorates in light.  I have used about half of my first bottle and will purchase more of this product.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Love this product will continue to purchase. My skin is improving.</li>
    <li> Ive been very pleased with this product. My skin looks brighter, pores are smaller, as are my fine lines.  I&#x27;m using this as a form of prevention because I have very few lines to begin with.</li>
    <li> I really like the Vitamin C serum. It works better than others and my skin looked better almost immediately.  It is nonirritating  and my skin is responding well as far as results go.  Skin feels firmer and smoother. Am also using a mild retinol containing moisturizer.  I am over 60 so I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I love the serum! It makes skin feel very tight and full of elasticity (smaller, tighter pores). I also see a brightness. Consider me a repeat customer, because I&#x27;m definitely buying the serum again.</li>
    <li> This is my new best friend.  I&#x27;ve been using now for a little over 2 weeks (Vitamin C in the am and Hyaluronic in the pm). I can already tell a difference in my skin. It is brighter, clearer, and has a nice glow.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the price is also great.  Erica, you guys have got a great product on your hands. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s changed the way I look</li>
    <li> I have truly enjoyed using your vitamin c serum. I have used vitamin c for a few years now however got tired of paying $50+ for it. I am so happy to have found your product and will definitely reorder once I am out. I use retin a at night so I incorporate the vitamin c into my morning routine as I have been told that the vitamin c could alter the benefits of the retin a if used at the same time. Thank you again for your amazing customer service and follow up.</li>
    <li> I like how it made my skin peel and is helping to fade my dark spots. I would have probably given it 5 stars but its still too early to see if will fade my daughters sun spots. So time will only tell but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I’m very pleased with the results of both, the vitamin C serum and the Hyaluronic acid serum. The combination of both has made a big difference on my skin; the C serum gives me a nice glow and the Hyaluronic acid serum has helped reduce the “marionette lines” around my mouth considerably well.&lt;br /&gt;Over all it has given me a more youthful look, I’m 51 years of age and I don’t expect to look like 20, but I will highly recommend both of this products to anyone within this age group.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for contacting me and jus so that you know, I deal with the public everyday and they have also notice the difference</li>
    <li> I am loving the serum. I think it is really improving the tone of my skin. I am so glad I found this! Great customer service. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love the serum.  My skin has become softer and smoother, and I&#x27;ve seen a decrease in blackheads in some of my trouble areas. I really like the consistency of the serum too.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face at all, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling suffocated with product. I tend to have oily skin and usually immediately become oily or sweaty when I use other products. </li>
    <li> I have been using this little magical bottle for a couple of weeks now. Man it really works. My skin already feels smoother and brighter overall. Very impressive with the results with such a short period of time using it. I don&#x27;t see my dark spot and some small scars fading away yet but I will definitely continue using it and see what it can help with those problems. BEST customer service ever! I have received emails from their Co-Founder for the follow-ups. Now I am trusting this company and its time to explore their other products!!!! Very Satisfied!!</li>
    <li> I have used half bottle of this product. I like it very much! I can use on my face and around eye. My skin is very sensitive but I do not have any problem to use this product. I have ordered 2nd bottle. Good product!</li>
    <li> FOLLOW UP:  While the product is not for me, I will say the customer service has Been amazing.  They made everything better by quick response, explanation of the product, and offering a 100% refund.    I gave the product to a friend who does seen to like it!    Thanks for the great customer service!!          ORIGINAL REVIEW:   first, it&#x27;s not clear like in the picture....it&#x27;s a thicker, white-ish gel, not a thin clear liquid.  I have oily skin, and found it too thick.  It felt like it didn&#x27;t absorb.    Also, it says \\&quot;no oil\\&quot; but has oil in it.  ????????</li>
    <li> Everything that this product says its going to do does it! I&#x27;ve tried other expensive Vit C products and this one is far superior. My skin feels smooth and healthy. I would completely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  It has greatly reduced the age spots on my hands and has helped minimize the lines around my lips which is what I was hoping for.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The serum’s been working great with my skin! I’ve noticed that my skin has been looking much healthier since I started using it, which was about a month ago. My pores are smaller and my dark spots and scars are noticeably lighter. I’ve been loving the results and have been using it morning and night. This and my clarisonic mia from Sephora have done wonders on my skin these last couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference for my stupidly getting to much sun in my youth.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!  I noticed within a weeks time how my skin had improved, from redness, and fine lines.  I am excited to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I read every review of this serum and I was excited to try this. I am not quite sure what all the fuss is about. It was a good price. I have been using it every day for a month before I put on my moisturizer and I just am not seeing what everyone else is. I have not noticed a difference in the tone of my skin as far as color goes. It does feel more firm, but that&#x27;s not what I wanted it for. I was hoping for an improved glow but I am just not seeing it. I also have had increased breakouts on my chin since starting this and I have never had a pimple problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is just for older skin.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST STUFF IN THE WORLD. IF SOMEONE TOOK ALL MY BEAUTY PRODUCTS AWAY THIS ONE IS THE ONE WE WOULD GO TO WAR OVER, ACTUALLY 3 ALL FROM AMAZON THIS VITAMIN C , MY KOJI SOAP, AND MY PERFECT HAIR MINOXIDIL. ALL THREE OF THESE ITEMS ARE MY MUST HAVES. I THOUGHT ABOUT MIXING MY OWN VITAMIN C SERUM, AND I ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT PURCHASING THE CHEAPER BIGGER BOTTLE BY ANOTHER BRAND (BUT TOO MANY USERS NOTED IT WAS VERY WATERY). THEN I DECIDED TO STICK WITH WHAT WORKS, SO I KEEP PURCHASING THIS SAME BRAND BECAUSE IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY MY SKIN FEELS, TO INCLUDE HELP IN CONTROLLING THE ACNE AND BLEMISH MARKS...BEST ADVICE EVER USE A PHYSICAL SUNSCREEN WITH THIS, AND REMEMBER WHATEVER YOU DO TO YOUR FACE DO THE SAME TO YOUR NECK.</li>
    <li> I love it!  My skin looks much more youthful and I will continue to buy it.  In just few days I noticed a tremendous difference in the softness of my complexion and reduction of fine lines.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in about 2 weeks.  Smaller pores and fine lines gone!  Love the texture of the serum.  A little sticky when you apply and then it soaks right in with no residue at all.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. My skin looks clear, smooth and hydrated. I will definitely purchase this again. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Could tell a difference in my face immediately. My age spots are fading after a weeks use.  Use it on my hands as well.</li>
    <li> I immediately saw a difference in my skin.  The customer service is the best I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  They emailed me right after I ordered it.  I wish I had known about this product sooner.</li>
    <li> Love The Product!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am loving this product.  I have received several compliments on my skin and I have only been using it for approx 2 weeks.  Feels nice going on and dries quickly.  I use it after washing/astringent but before moisturizing.  I have been using a small drop twice a day - morning and night.  This was a good price compaired to other Vitamin C serums.</li>
    <li> I am 51 and this has helped with my wrinkles on my face, made my face look youthful. Drys fast, I use boots #7 moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! Only 2 drops twice a day on face is all I need.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more luminous &amp; even toned. Highly recommend TruSkin!</li>
    <li> I have used both the Hyaluronic acid Serum and the Vitamin C serum. The products are great and the customer service was the best I&#x27;ve experienced in a long time. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this serum,  when I used it it has made my skin MORE dry than before.  I do not understand why but this&lt;br /&gt;is my experience.  It is too much of a hassle to return it….is the only reason, I won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I have &#x27;mature skin&#x27;…….and use the best/organic cosmetics/face care products I can afford, from either Whole Foods or Pharmica&lt;br /&gt;and this was not purchased from those stores; I will also not make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> I use it every night, it&#x27;s potent and gentle at the same time. My face feels like so refreshed each morning. This is my second bottle. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, not oily. My face feels good after putting it on at night. Will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This really has made a difference</li>
    <li> Somewhere along the way I saw that a vitamin C serum helped with fine lines on your face. I&#x27;m turning 50 in a few months and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Saw this one (price was great) and ordered it. I&#x27;ve been using it for under 2 weeks and I saw and felt improvement in just a few days. My face is brighter, smoother and the little lines especially under my eyes have smoothed. My eye liner doesn&#x27;t crease as much now. I use it in the morning under moisturizer and at night too. I have always been a moisturizer fanatic and purchase products often. Nothing has ever compaired to how this makes my face look. I also put some on my neck so I don&#x27;t have turkey neck! LOL! The best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for my face. AAA+++</li>
    <li> For me the product works great, I like it very much. I apply it, it is a little cooling down my skin and leaves it more radiant. Then I only need to add my usual day or night cream and I am fine... It nourishes and softens my skin and it feels more hydrated since using.  For sure I will ordering again when it runs out..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think that the price is very convenient for the quality.... So I really can suggest to try it!!</li>
    <li> I’m amazed-at 75 I’ve never paid much attention to products. I had my first facial at a very upscale spa a month ago. They recommended Vit C for $60 a bottle. I researched the web and found you and am totally hooked. I am definitely brighter and wrinkles are less. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any improvement in my skin after using this product for several weeks.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I started using Vitamin C Serum day &amp; night  3 weeks ago, and have noticed significant improvement of the fine lines on my forehead between my eyebrows!  I see a slight reduction of fine lines around my mouth and neck!  I love the contact I got from the beginning of my purchase asking if I had any questions about the product.  Erica is very knowledgeable and quick to respond to inquiries!  I highly recommend this company and Vitamin C Serum!</li>
    <li> Great job!  Love the product!</li>
    <li> So far this product is good, I&#x27;m 51 years old and I really don&#x27;t have wrinkles but I been using this product a little over a month and the only thing I can really see is I use to have sags on my dimple area. And now it seem to disappear , not sure if is because I lost weight but I had little sags on my dimple area and now there almost gone.</li>
    <li> after 2 weeks I have noticed improvement in texture and beginning smoothness of lines.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, will never us anything else.</li>
    <li> Excellent customer service. My skin has become more firm &amp; the sun damage is starting to fade. I can&#x27;t wait to see how healthier my skin becomes with continued use. I&#x27;m highly satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product  and will continue to use it as long as possible.  My skin tone has improved and the wrinkles have been reduced.  Erica has been wonderful about following up with me as to my results.</li>
    <li> I noticed right away that my skin appeared firmer. I apply it day and night. Will definitely be purchasing more!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I have used it about 3 weeks now and my skin does feel firmer. It goes well on my face, doesn&#x27;t smell, and lasts a long time. Just a few drops does it. For the price, it&#x27;s a real bargain. Erika also sends emails and checks in with you.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, great price!</li>
    <li> I am loving it. My skin is pretty good for my age-69, but  I am seeing some subtle differences. Definitely, around my eyes and on my neck. Love how my face feels when I put it on. It firms up my skin instantly. I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any problems, not even around my eyes. Great price. I&#x27;ve been paying $90 for a product that doesn&#x27;t work as well. I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Very good product and it does what it claims to do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a real change to my skin - my neck is not crepe-y anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is much more even, wrinkles around my eyes are lessened.&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter even noticed.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely re-order when I run out!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I&#x27;ve only started using it, but am already having very good results.  I like the texture -- it has a thin, slippery quality that seems to be absorbed very well, and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue on the face.  Also, I notice that after using it my make up goes on much smoother and seems to last longer.  I am seeing improvement in my skin -- it does look clearer, and perhaps even a little firmer.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more improvements with time -- but this is quite a bit of result to see in a short time.  I&#x27;ve tried so many skin products I could never list them all, and I have high standards -- so you can believe me when I say that this one seems completely worthwhile.  I will definitely keep using it, and with the cost, it is a wonderful value.  I&#x27;m happy I found it!</li>
    <li> Best vitamin C for skin ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> I think that by using my BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum my face might look better eventually.  It certainly is delightful to use, and is probably working away at my wrinkles and lines without my realizing same.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a lot of things I&#x27;ve noticed since I started using this serum. For one the texture of my skin and the overall appearance is a lot more smoother. My skin looks and feels amazing. I&#x27;ve even noticed my skin has a slight glow to it. When I look in the mirror my skin looks radiant and alive. Where I live it&#x27;s always sunny, but I never bothered to wear sunscreen...like ever, until a few months ago. I suffered from sun spots and blotchy looking skin and now my sun spots are fading and my skin looks a lot more toned! I&#x27;ve even noticed some of my acne spots are gone! I also suffer from dark..VERY dark under eye circles and even though they are still there I have noticed they have started to lightened up a bit. I think with continued use this product could be my dark circle savior. *fingers crossed* I&#x27;ve only been using this product  for three weeks now and I&#x27;m already impressed with the results. I&#x27;m excited to see what the overall results will be like in next two to three months from now.</li>
    <li> Just now trying this product.  As described.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really see/feel any difference.</li>
    <li> My skin feels softer and more hydrated since I&#x27;ve been using this product. My dark spots have slightly lightened. The dry rough texture of the spot is now smooth so it is working well for me. I use it once daily. I recommended it to one of my clients. I&#x27;m so happy to find a more natural organic product that works. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase. I appreciate such a lovely serum and the care that has gone into creating it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and my husband (out of the blue) tells me my skin Looks  like its glowing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for two weeks and I am extremely happy with it.  My skin looks firmer. I put is on my face and even around my eyes. Many creams irritate my eyes, even eye creams but this doesn&#x27;t. It is a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this serum and it&#x27;s doing exactly what it claims--repair sun damage. I messed up my skin by over exposing it to the sun seven years ago (how? don&#x27;t ask... It was  stupid move by me). I&#x27;ve used a ton of products to repair the damage. I&#x27;ve gone to facialists and many were a bust. Recently I started going to a popular skin care place in West Hollywood. Finally my skin was healing BUT not fast enough. During my treatments I decided to order this product and voila--instant change. It&#x27;s hard to believe that something THIS good is set at this price point. I will say this--if you have sun damage, then this product will work.</li>
    <li> Just want to let you know I love the C serum and see positive changes. My skin looks and feels better. I also received the retinol moisturizer and think it is great. It has been fine on my skin with-no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great products and awesome customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the Dr Oz show stated vitamin c was the best thing to use on you face but I feel that it makes my skin feel rather stiff and I am going back to my Olay regenerest products.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this stuff a try, in hopes of evening out my skin tone. I noticed a difference in the first week! I use it twice a day, (morning and night) after washing my face with a vitamin c cleanser, then let it dry before putting my normal vitamin c cream on top. My skin seems prettier...it&#x27;s hard to describe, but I&#x27;m completely happy about how it seems to shrink the appearance of my pores. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using this stuff.</li>
    <li> I am loving the product. I bought it to remove dark spots, but it is doing even more. It is making my skin more uniform and it is also reducing my eyes puffiness considerably. Very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Every skin product should do what they are suposed to. This one does! I have tried many other serums that do nothing for your skin, some of them pretty expensive as Lancome Genifique. Just get you mad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased that it is organic and seems to be working very effectively as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price is great!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have noticed a huge difference in my skin and have also received multiple comments from others on how great my skin looks  highly recommend!</li>
    <li> thank you for getting in contact with me regarding the serum that I bought from your company.  I hadn&#x27;t used anything like that before, and I really like it.  I live at the beach, and the weather can be very harsh on skin.  My husband uses it too, and he is a big fan as well.  I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to ask my opinion;  that shows to me that you and your company are paying attention.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.  I started using TruSkin C just a couple of weeks ago.  But more importantly than price, for someone who has so many allergies and sensitivities to product ingredients as myself, I love having found something that actual nourishes, soothes and replenishes.&lt;br /&gt;A definite keeper :-)</li>
    <li> My skin actually looks like it has made improvement upon using the product I really do like it. Also has improved a scar on my face</li>
    <li> Really like it! Not oily, not &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; scented, goes on smooth and I swear...I think I see a difference! I am about to turn 26 and live in Florida. I am always worried about sun damage, and I feel like this has made my skin more even, glowing and clear! For $25 it&#x27;s a steal..it&#x27;s a big bottle, and even after using a whole plunger full each night it&#x27;s still pretty full! I mix 1 squirt in with my Olay moisturizer for my neck, face and chest. Will buy again! Also, the bottle has a 50% off code for your next order!</li>
    <li> I have just used my first bottle of this serum and really love it.  It seems to help my skin and most importantly the elasticity of the skin.  I just viewed a Dr. Oz segment where two facial surgeons both said that the most important ingredient you can put on your face to keep it youthful is vitamin C.  I plan to use this regularly and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, but after 3 days of using it with my regular skin care, I broke out into 20-30 very small under the skin blemishes that still have not cleared.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I was skeptical at first, however, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I love the way my skin looks.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and do not want anything heavy on my face and this seems to do the trick.  It instantly creates a firmness sensation when I apply it.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and I can still wear a light moisturizer over it during the day.  Satisfied Customer!</li>
    <li> Tightens my face after each use. Just ordered the second one.  Update: lowered the rating because of sediment found in the first bottle. I was grossed out and put the second bottle away.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for around a month now and I really love it!  It makes my skin feel so moist and gives it such a nice glow.  I have only been using it at night and it still works great!  Will definitely keep using this serum because I finally found something that makes my skin look great and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out in a rash!</li>
    <li> Totally love this product! My skin is smoother and brighter, my acne scars fading away so quick and it help to reduce my acne too! The customer service is good! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more :)</li>
    <li> I have been using TruSkin&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for approximately two weeks and can definitely tell a difference in the brown spots on my face.  I spent my younger years in the sun more than I should have and definitely have the age spots to show for it.  My husband went for his annual visit to the dermatalogist yesterday and asked what he could do for the spots on his arms and the doctor recommended vitamin C serum.  I will definitely purchase again.  My order from TruSkin arrived earlier than anticipated.</li>
    <li> So far I am loving this serum. I have large dark blotches on my cheeks from last pregnancy/sun and this is the only product I&#x27;ve used where I am actually seeing slight results so far. My skin also looks a bit more healthy and fine lines are reducing!</li>
    <li> I love the Vitamin C serum.  My skin looks great.  I am 71 years young and take good care of my skin.  Living in Florida I was a sun worshiper as a younger person.  I use a lot of good products on my face, however, I prime it with a good toner and the Vitamin C serum.  I liked it so much I ordered two more bottles and will order more in the future.  Great product.  Love it!  Another perk with this product is that a representative actually cares about how you feel about the product and will contact you and answer any questions you have.</li>
    <li> I have seriously only used this for a few days under my organic grapeseed oil as a nightly moisturizer and i have noticed a huge difference! not sure if its a combo of both or just this syrum but whatever it is, its working already and i will buy more!!</li>
    <li> Sorry, I don&#x27;t see any change.  On the plus side....no harm done either.</li>
    <li> I instantly felt a difference after using this serum.  It left my skin soft and firmed it up.  I have acne and acne scars and after 2 weeks of using this I can tell a difference in my face.  My acne scars seem to be fading.  I wish I could buy this in the gallons!  I just ordered two more bottles and can&#x27;t wait to see after a few months how my face will have improved.  This is well worth the money.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very gentle! Absorbs right away</li>
    <li> It does not fill my expectations....I was waiting for something more surprising but I tried it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical on using this product since I have a sensitive skin. I have been using this product now for more than a month and I can see the difference. I had marks under my eye&#x27;s and lips and after using for 2 weeks they were barely noticeable. As mentioned you only need few drops to apply on the skin and that two drops reaches very far. You can use this product on your neck too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 28 YO and I thought this products will not help me much but believe me you can see the change in few weeks. Best thing with this product is it dries on the skin very fast and you can apply your everyday lotion so protect from the winter. I use this two times a day after shower in the morning and before going to bed and I see the freshness in the skin everydy morning. Love it and will suggest for everyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The vitamin C serum is fantastic.  I have been using it for almost three weeks and at first I used it in the evening only.  I am now using it morning and night.  My skin looks and feels amazing.  I have noticed that the look of my skin has changed; it has a better tone, feels lovely and soft, and some of the lines I have are also softening.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to me to use only natural or organic products on my skin, as I am prone to have reactions to certain products.  I will be continuing to use TruSkin Naturals, and will also be recommending them to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I wanted this to be my solution for scarring and discoloration, but sadly it worsened the problem. This product broke me out for the first time in months. I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t see anything different</li>
    <li> I started looking for a Vitamin C serum to reduce acne scarring and other dark spot issues. This is the only brand I&#x27;ve bothered to order twice. This is the first product I&#x27;ve used where I&#x27;ve noticed a quick brightening and pore reducing effect. Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried this one doesn&#x27;t lead to more breakouts. I still need to moisturize after I use it but overall am very happy with the value of this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!! Seeing good results! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and will continue to purchase more products from this seller</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do squat for me.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I like that it is cruelty-free, and produced in the USA! It makes my skin very soft, but also tightens at the same time. I am going to be 50 years old, and the teens that I work with think I am in my 30&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I suffer from acne and dark spots. After about a month of using this product I see a difference and I can use less powder. I use the vitamin C serum in the AM and another serum at night. My skin has not been this clear in years!In the past I have bought expensive serums and cream from Clinique and Bloomingdales with no results. I am amazed that these products are so affordable. For reference I am a dark skinned Black woman. Its  hard to find products that are good for dark skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an aging Physician. Looking alert and refreshed is important to me. I&#x27;m not interested in looking &#x27;young&#x27;. A friend suggested using TruSkin. So I tried it, mainly for fun. To my surprise, after 4-5 days, I noticed that the furrows on my forehead were less apparent.&lt;br /&gt;Other areas of wrinkles began to smooth out. A friend asked me what new jogging paths I had changed to.&lt;br /&gt;  Because of this, the reasonable price, and the fact that I only really need to use it where needed, I am definitely going to use this product regularly. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i got intrigued by the overwhelming reviews of this product. i decided to try it. been using it for months now and i noticed a difference on my face. on the lower part of the cheeks where my jaws are used to look so sagging. now it looks like skin has been lifted. lil bit plumped. and i&#x27;m happy about the result. now i&#x27;m waiting for the lines on the upper part of my nose to disappear :) i also want to mention that my skin has gone clearer from some dark spots and it has gone smoother. delivery was fast as well!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product my skin looks more radiant</li>
    <li> I love how it makes your skin feel.</li>
    <li> Absorb to skin nicely, no grease left behind. Will continue to use to see more resulst with pore and skin tone.</li>
    <li> I been using this for a while and I love the  way it makes my face look an feel it is wonderful I use it every morning an every  night</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  I have super sensitive skin and this serum is 100% compatible with it.  Many facials products I have tried have caused a rash-like reaction on my skin, but this does not.  I also love how this product absorbs well into my skin and does not leave an oily residue or cause any breakouts; however, it still leaves my skin feeling hydrated.  The best part is it has minimized the appearance of wrinkles and added a real glow to my complexion. As I approach my mid 30&#x27;s, I am starting to develop fine wrinkles in my cheeks that are possibly a sign of early collagen or hydration loss.  Well not anymore!  TruSkin Natural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum came to the rescue!</li>
    <li> i love and use it twice a day, made my skin smooth amd my wrinkle start dissapering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this for quit sometime. Finally got it and absolutely love it!!!  Everyone ask me what cologne I&#x27;m wearing and I tell them &amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34; and I purchased it online from Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product has my skin appearing couple years younger.</li>
    <li> No difference in skin after using twice a day for almost a month.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  I could tell a difference after only one week of use.  I took a before picture  and have been taking weekly picture for the past three weeks.  Will update after a few more photos to show progression.</li>
    <li> Amazing on the face!!!</li>
    <li> I am loving it!  Just ordered my 2nd bottle!~  I get so many compliments on my skin and have told many friends about the serum.  I have tried so many Vitamin C serums and this is just as good if not better than the very expensive ones I have purchased from my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a vitamin C serum for years that would not irritate my skin as I use Retin A on my face also.  I finally found TruSkin naturals vitamin C Serum and it is agreeing with my skin!  I love the fact that it also has hyaluronic acid and vitamin E in the serum. I&#x27;ve tried so many other vitamin c products on the market and have been disappointed every time until now. Since I have been using this serum my skin looks much brighter.  The customer service is also incredible!  It is evident that making customers happy is their number one priority. I would give it 6 stars if I could.  I am looking forward to trying other products from TruSkin!</li>
    <li> I will NEVER EVER stop using this product.... EVER😁</li>
    <li> Great product..so happy with the way my face looks.  My skin is softer,  my skin tone is brighter I would purchase this product again.  Great customer service.</li>
    <li> After reading the numerous positive reviews and seeing the reasonable price of this product, I decided to give it a go.  I&#x27;ve just turned 36 and have decent skin, minimal acne/breakouts, few light brown spot areas, small amount of creases and wrinkles setting in.  So mostly I was hoping to see some sort of rejuvenation and help to skin that&#x27;s now showing some real aging signs.  Also because I feel like my skin is a bit dull, ruddy in areas and really want to nip those brown spots in the butt!&lt;br /&gt;Have to say after using my first bottle that I&#x27;m totally flabbergasted by peoples results.  I don&#x27;t understand why so many can supposedly have improvement in so many different areas but I don&#x27;t see one darn thing.  Nothing has changed.  I even took a photo of my skin when I first began (because I know sometimes subtle gradual changes are hard to see by ourselves)  and now another pic confirms it.  Nada.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say rate it &amp;#34;I hate it&amp;#34; with one star, because my skin didn&#x27;t get worse or react adversely.  And it wasn&#x27;t a huge waste of money.  But sadly I realize I&#x27;m probably much better off just eating an orange everyday!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I think it works as well or better than the much more expensive product I have been using. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends</li>
    <li> I read reviews on so many different moisturizing serums before deciding on this one, and I&#x27;m so glad I selected this one.  I have sensitive, combination oily skin and this serum hasn&#x27;t caused a ny breakouts or allergic reactions.  It&#x27;s really effective underneath my moisturizer.  Within a day I saw a big difference, and I continue to see an overall improvement in my skin&#x27;s moisture level.  I will definitely buy more when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I saw a difference in my skin almost immediately, as it feels softer to the touch and more hydrated.  I have had several compliments this past week about how my skin seems to glow.  As a vegetarian of over 30 years, I also appreciate the cruelty free aspect of this serum. Shipping is very fast too!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery Great service I only just started using the product but it feels good on, light no stinging and I have seen improvement with my pores. I am pleased with this C serum. I have used many and found they either were iritating or left my skin dry not with this.</li>
    <li> I do like the serum.  I like that it isn’t as thick a sticky as some that I have tried.  I have been using it in the morning along with my Retin A at night.  I like the combination.</li>
    <li> I am doing an aggressive treatment using Retin-A and all is going great.  And I just had five facial brown age spots removed with salicylic acid.  My skin is looking great but still healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So most anything can have a burning sensation - even my castile soap and skin creams.  This Vitamin C serum did not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt continued use is wonderful [just based on the plethora of reviews here] but I was more worried about initial skin reaction and it was more than fine.  In fact I just noticed Hyaluronic acid was in it (I was after the Vitamin C and E) so I am glad I bought it not knowing that because it absorbed fast with no stinging at all.  I will do more of a review in three months.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  My skin has a more even tone, feels smoother and  looks brighter.  The first week I used the serum morning and night following with a moisturizer.  I now am applying it once daily and  am thankful to have found such a superior product at an affordable price.  If you are searching for an effective product in skin care I would highly recommend the the purchase of TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I started using this a couple weeks ago; I was worried about having a reaction, but have had no problems. I put a thin coat on at night and once dry I put on my normal night lotion. I had heard it worked good, but was amazed at how quickly I had results. I&#x27;m 53 years old and over the past couple years have noticed more wrinkles and brown spots. Within one week of using this I noticed my face looked much younger and the brown spots faded substantially. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results on my face and a couple days ago started putting it on the back of my hands (for brown spots) and my eye lids. I&#x27;ve tried other wrinkle creams that were supposed to help, but this is the first thing I&#x27;ve used that actually made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and have noticed my skin&#x27;s texture is smoother and softer.  There are not many products that actually do what they claim they will do these days, but this one does!  I am 53 years old and have noticed the darker spots diminishing greatly and my skin looks more radiant since I&#x27;ve been using this.  I will be trying more of TruSkin&#x27;s products because of this one being such a good addition to my skin care regimen!</li>
    <li> I initially started trying vitamin C serum because I had been hearing so much about them from friends and on tv. I have tried a few types, and the TruSkin Naturals is definitely my favorite. It is 98% natural, 72% organic and fragrance free. I found my skin to immediately feel and look more smooth and firm. It is not sticky like others I have tried and overall, I feel like my skin is brighter and looks more healthy. I will definitely continue to use and recommend TruSkin Neutrals!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always envied my mother for having naturally great skin. It&#x27;s always been baby soft and at almost 70 has very few wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve been using this Vitamin C serum for almost 2 weeks and my skin has never looked better. My wrinkles aren&#x27;t as noticeable and my skin is as soft as my mother&#x27;s.  I had started getting age spots and I can see that they too are fading.  I will not go a morning now without using this serum... I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I immedialty notice my skin is smoother and more luminous!  Feels really silky going on. Can&#x27;t wait to try the Hyluronic Acid with this for even better results!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is GREAT!!!! Dark circle under eyes getting lighter and helping with skin texture.  A must have item!!!!  Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I am always looking for the greatest skincare.  So, when I stumbled upon this Vitamin C serum, I had to give it a try. Although, I have only been using the product a couple of weeks now, I have not seen a huge difference in my skin. However, the customer service  goes beyond any I have ever dealt with of any company.  Any company that stands behind their products and the satisfaction of their customers will definitely keep me as a customer and will make me give the products a true trial run for best results!</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with the vitamin c serum. I bought it to help reduce the puffiness under my eyes, and so far I am seeing good results. I&#x27;ve bought other serums and seen no results at all. I&#x27;ve only been using the vitamin c serum for a couple of weeks and this one is the one for me.</li>
    <li> I feel it&#x27;s a bit watered down. I thought it would be thicker and be more like a moisturizer for the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I noticed the dark spots in my skin clearing up immediately. It is worth the price and I am very pleased with the results. I will definitely buy more and recommend to a friend. The customer service followed up after my purchase and they are very responsive</li>
    <li> I noticed a small difference right away but now after 3-4 weeks of regular use (I use morning and evening) and I am know seeing even greater results. Definite reduction in fine lines and a smoother appearance to my skin.  This Vitamin C serum will now become part of my regular routine.  Greater seller customer service as well.  They e-mailed asking how I liked the product, provided recommendations and even sent a follow-up e-mail.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say that my skin has improved greatly since using this product... wished I did a before and after picture. I have noticed that my pores are smaller and there is a fullness to my skin and some dark areas have started to lightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, this is a great product and would order again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this will work to take away fine lines or not but it sure feels awesome!  I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but I love how it feels.  Not sure if it does anything yet but I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love your product. It feels wonderful and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It feels like I&#x27;m nourishing my skin. This serum has become an integral part of my morning routine. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Like but would prefer higher % of Vitamin C</li>
    <li> When i first read the reviews i was a bit skeptical but i still decided to order at first i thought it would be oily and was quite disappointed at the texture but then i decided to use it and was amazed at the results after a couple of weeks.  So glad i got to try it. Thanks guys.</li>
    <li> I actually LOVE the serum. Iv&#x27;e been using it with a microderm abrasion brush and think the combo is awesome. Feels like the serum is going deep into my pores. Love your product because it is not too think and not too thin. Glides on nicely. My co-worker actually told me my skin looked GREAT the other day. I have recommended your product to numerous friends. Love that it is all natural and affordable. Good luck with future sales!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much change.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product!  I love the way it goes on your skin so easily and absorbed so quickly.  My skin feels firmer!</li>
    <li> Love TruSkin Naturals! I&#x27;m 32, and have always taken care of my skin. I&#x27;ve bought high end products along with your everyday drugstore finds, but these two products are definitely on my list of favorites! Can tell a major difference in my skin after just a few weeks of use! Also loved how the company followed up with me after my purchase to see how they were working! Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I am usually sceptical about serums but the money back guarantee sold me. I have seen a difference in my skin tone and it is a great addition to my current skin routine. It isn&#x27;t sticky or bad smelling. It actually doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it at all. I like the dropper applicator, I don&#x27;t feel like I waste any product. I know this bottle will last for a long time. I will be purchasing again when I finally run out of it.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It tingles a little at first but realized it was because of how roughly I washed my face. I am seeing major improvements in my skin and under eye bags. I love this. I just started letting my mom whom is 72 use this as well. I will continue to use this as a daily regimen. I use kojie soap, rinse my face and let completely dry and then apply serum. I am in LOVE...My husband has commented on my progeress. I have only been doing this regimen for one straight week twice a day. Cant wait to see the changes after a month.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have been using it with my clairsonic mia 2 and i could not be happier with the results. I apply it after cleansing, under my moisterizer at night, and then again when i wake up. Now I hardly need any make up at all! The serum is thin, is absorbed quickly, and is not sticky at all. My skin is softer, more clear, so smooth, and even glows. The customer service is awesome. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I like this it smoothes my skin on my face &amp; chest!</li>
    <li> I had a bad reaction to this product. I have very sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I have noticed a difference in my complexion after only a few weeks. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I recently ordered your C and Hyaluronic Tru Skin Natural products and want to tell you how pleased I am with them.  I have used the C serum for approximately two weeks &amp; am seeing a difference already. I have always had a problem with comedones and this is the first and only product that seems to be working to eliminate them.  My (older) skin also seems to be less dry than it was prior to using the serum.  I just received the Hyaluronic serum a few days ago, but so far am pleased with as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely reorder Tru Skin as needed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything since I&#x27;ve started using this serum. I was really hoping to see some kind of change, but have not.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will try making my own.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of use my skin does feel smoother, which is nice, but that is the only result I see. I was hoping for a little fading of dark spots. I will continue use and keep my fingers for at least a little fading.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin C!  I had been on a quest trying all different brands to find one not so watery and that was a quality product, that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg...and that I just just plain liked.  I found it with TruSkin!  Thanks for a great product at an affordable price!!  Also, nice to get your follow up emails...nice touch/customer service!!</li>
    <li> okay, but no significant difference.</li>
    <li> Yes I love it! It works wonders!!!</li>
    <li> I really love the serum. My skin looks and feels great. AWESOME customer service and AWESOME product.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love how clear and smooth my skin appears the next morning.  My pores are so small too, it&#x27;s really noticeable.  My face wrinkles looks plumper, less noticeable too.  It&#x27;s really amazing.  I will continue to use for a few more months since I&#x27;ve just started and hopefully it will fade my acne scars. Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin looking and feeling firm and bright.&lt;br /&gt;It will be a part of my skin routine for quite some time.</li>
    <li> TruSkin Naturals is working so GREAT!!.  My skin is feeling smooth as butter and so soft.  I haven&#x27;t felt my skin this soft in a long time...okay, maybe ever.  The old acne marks are drying up and less pronounced and my skin is not left feeling greasy or dry.  I used to be so embarrassed of my acne scars that I had to buy concealer.  I am definitely going to keep ordering TruSkin Naturals again and make this as a staple item of my daily beauty regimen.  Thanks for creating such a fantastic product and for the discount on my next bottle.  I am going to recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> So far so good I a still checking it out!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Results can be seen on skin in less then a week.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month back and I would say it looks pretty positive - I have Indian skin (wheatish) and around three months back, made the nasty mistake of getting some laser treatment on some moles on my face with some shady clinic that left ugly spots all over my upper face and neck - I scar bad and it takes ages for them to go (Have retained scars from small scratches for 15 years!) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sceptical about using yet another product that claims to get rid of scars - and I must admit that they are not healed yet - However I think I am starting to see faintest of lightening of the scars on my neck and that gives me hope. The texture of the skin surely feels good - but then that was notreally my concern. I will personally market this product the day I see my scars fade to a point of not being noticed :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW full marks to Erica who does a really great job of connecting with us buyers and addressing individual queries. I am truly impressed with this.</li>
    <li> When I stumbled upon the TruSkin vitamin C serum I was at the time getting married in two weeks and had a few dark spots left behind from popping those stress pimples (I know..).  I read through a lot of great reviews on the product and can see why.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting any drastic changes in my dark spots, but I could definitely see some lightness and my skin began to get it&#x27;s glow back.  By the time the wedding came around, my skin seemed more moisturized and nourish to help heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently reside in Seattle, Washington for school and originally from Honolulu.  My skin in Seattle is missing that sunshine and so the vitamin C serum is a great substitute to make it feel more lively overall.  I noticed when I was back home in Honolulu the serum seemed to work even better and significantly lightened my dark spots.  I apply the serum in the morning and night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;d like to say that Erica is awesome with her customer service.  She helps to show customers that the TruSkin company cares about its customer and their experience.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c. It works great! I have been using this for one month. The lines around mouth are less noticeable! Its really works better than the expansive brand!  I will keep using this!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Just last night, my husband commented on my skin. He said is was &amp;#34;glowing.&amp;#34; (And no, I&#x27;m not pregnant!!! Lol) I usually have sensitive skin and break out when trying new products. This is gentle enough for even super sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll be ordering again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the vitamin C serum!! My skin is tighter and looks smoother. I will be ordering again!!  I use morning and night. Thanks Erica for your excellent customer service!!</li>
    <li> i love this serum!!!!</li>
    <li> Used this on one side of my face for 2 weeks.  Wrinkles seem worse on the side I treated with this product.  I don’t believe the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Yes, I have tried it and especially after using it twice a day saw much improved results. I recently purchased another product which cost me $242.00 and didn&#x27;t get any good results. I like this much better and the price is unbelievable.-Sheila</li>
    <li> I just received my second bottle of this Vitamin C.  I really noticed a difference in my complexion when I stopped using it.  So now, I won&#x27;t go without it!  It makes my skin look brighter.  I love it</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as some other vitamin C products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Good product it does what it says it will do. My face is firming up and looking youthful. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using &amp;#34;The Trilogy&amp;#34; with vitamin c serum for about 3 weeks now and I notice my skin getting super clear and smooth. I can really see a difference already. I already put in for another order because I don&#x27;t want to run out. Really love it!</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick and prompt.  The item is good, overall, excellent.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the first time i tried it!!! Amazing. My skin fell lifted and tighter.  I added this to my regular beauty routine.  It enhances the day and night creams I use making them more effective. Love it.  Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I noticed a differance in two days, and when I thought that maybe it was in my head ….my sister asked what I was using. Crazy just on two applications. I only applied it at night after I washed my face then my face cream on top… great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Love it! I expected it to be oily but it&#x27;s not at all and I really like how fast it absorbs. My skin is smoother and has a healthy glow. I&#x27;m hooked :)</li>
    <li> My smiling lines, dark circles, pimples, dark spots, dry spots have pretty much disappeared in about 3 months of use. I use every morning and night and I am buying my second bottle next week!!</li>
    <li> Wife like using this more at night, she still using it which means its working for her. Great stuff</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it twice a week and the lines on my face are much less noticeable than before. Good product, good price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> So, I needed to give it some time to determine how it is working so I waited for at least 2 weeks and I like it! I use it every morning &amp; at night. My face was already soft but now it seems to feel smoother. My palm with which I apply it to my face, was callused but now feels soft. Before I started using it initially, I had a random pimple  scar and it helped that pimple scar to heal and diminished the appearance. That was the first thing I noticed. It is working for me! My sister also wanted me to use it for some time and then give her some feedback before she jumps on the bandwagon. She lives abroad  so I will be purchasing her stater bottle soon.</li>
    <li> Keeps skin soft, bright and moisturized.</li>
    <li> this is a excellent product as well</li>
    <li> Me and my husband use the serum. I find my skin glowing. My hubby&#x27;s skin is very tan and the pores are open. He frequently gets whiteheads. After using the serum he feels the roughness is reducing. He seems happy with applying it as he on his own applies it now a days. It has reduced one of my responsibility ;-).</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday and it has minimized the fine laugh wrinkles around my eyes quite a bit. It only take a small amount to cover the area I am concerned about so this bottle will last me for a while. The effects are not immediate but persistent use will yield reasonable results. Time will tell if this will keep the issue from getting worse.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am very happy with the results and I see that my skin is brighter and my pores are noticeably smaller.I have been using it both morning and night after I wash my face and I wonder if its too much, however, that&#x27;s how consistent I&#x27;ve been I have also been using Neutrogina wrinkle repair for night at the same time over my vitamin C, but I can tell the difference I feel has to do more with the Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 4 months now... For the first 2 months, I used it morning and night. The past two months, I&#x27;ve been using it 2-3 times a week once a day for maintence. I LOVE IT! I just wear tinted moisturizer for make up and I have strangers ask me how I get my skin so glowy. My routine for face cleansing is a face scrub 2 times a week, then cleaning everyday with micellar water and then this product... I LOVE IT and about to order my second batch before I run out. I want to try the retinol syrum and the cream plus the eye cream... Its that good that I want to try the line up. I wish I had taken before and after pictures to show the difference.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I notice that when I use a whole syringe of the liquid, its a little much. I just use half and then it spreads evenly across my whole face and neck with a little to spare for my hands.</li>
    <li> I have really like this products so far. I received an e-mail prior to getting the product with an outline on how and when the product should be applied which I found very helpful. Since then I have received another e-mail asking if I like the product and how it is working for me. I was surprised to get these e-mails as I have never had a company reachout to me before to inquire about how I like their products. I will most definetly be purchasing from TruSkin again.</li>
    <li> I am on bottle #2, about half way through, and i love this product! I bought it mainly to try and lighten the dark spots on my face from sun damage. The stuff from the drug store just stopped working. However, the TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum worked! It took about 1 whole bottle to see results, and if I would have done it day and night I think it would have been sooner, but lo and behold, it worked! Besides the lightening of my dark spots, this serum also makes the skin on my face and chest much softer and decreases pore size. I don&#x27;t see myself ever ordering any other serum...plus it is all natural and made in the USA! I feel happy supporting this company and product! And NO I do not work for them, I really am just a customer!</li>
    <li> Since I got your e-mail I have been trying to pay attention to my skin. I have been applying the C serum one or twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe there is a little smoothing out of fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is more help than any other product I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to pay attention to my skin &amp; use the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You for caring.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 months now and my experience has been nothing short of amazing. I have a dime size brown age spot on the side of my nose that has been there for a year or longer. I was lucky enough to discover Truskin Vitamin C serum while searching around on Amazon one day. I bought a small bottle and within the first 3 weeks the brown spot faded by about 75%. I was amazed by this so I bought a 2 oz bottle on my next purchase. I can&#x27;t see the age spot unless I get close to the mirror. On top of that all the skin on my face looks amazing and I&#x27;m 57 years old. Try this product for your self and you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I even received an e-mail from Erica one of the co owners asking me how I liked there serum and how well it worked. That&#x27;s just too awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Tom Holmes</li>
    <li> These products continue to amaze me. While the rest of you (women) pay hundreds and maybe even thousands, you&#x27;re missing out on hidden gems that sell for less than $20 and work wonders.</li>
    <li> The vitamin TruSkin serum is FANTASTIC. My skin loves it. It brightens, clears and smooths my skin. I use it twice a day and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product knowing that with my chemical insensitivity I might have difficulty with even a light fragrance.unfortunately I was correct and gave it to my friend who absolutely loves it! I was very surprised to receive an e-mail from a company inquiring about my experience with it. I explained it was a wonderful product but because of my own difficulties with fragrances I had to give it to my friend who was having a wonderful experience using it. There was nothing wrong with the product  still I was informed that because I could not use it, I was being issued a full refund. My friend will continue to order it as she loves the way it makes your skin feels and I am jealous that I cannot use this product. I can see it has lightened her dark circles and her skin seems to glow. And, I&#x27;ve never had customer service like this before!</li>
    <li> Do not notice any tingling on face as I have with previous vit C</li>
    <li> Ok...so I wrote a review earlier but put it on the wrong page...I just wanted to share that when I ordered this product...it was just to order...hard to explain...But my point is I have been using it for 3 plus weeks and the difference in my skin is noticeable...feels softer, feels so much better to the touch...trust me...just try it....I have been using it twice a day...about 4 drops...I then put ceraphe moisturizer cream over it...</li>
    <li> This product did wonders for my skin.  Saw definite improvement in lines and tone after just one month of use.  It is reasonable priced also.  Just yesterday some one told me I looked younger than the last time they saw me.  I am 73 years old.</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old but I inherited good genes from my Mom so my skin has weathered well. I do notice that I have had no increase of wrinkles and my skin feels &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; (is that a word?) I use it on my neck and chest as well to keep it tight. So, yes, I like your product. It is a bit watery but I have learned how to use it even so.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  However, I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any major change.  It does give my skin a bit of a glow but I&#x27;ve used the entire Serious Skin Care Vitamin C line and have achieved much better results in a shorter timeframe.</li>
    <li> I really love the Vitamin C Serum.  In the short time I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve seen big improvements in my skin&#x27;s radiance and ability to hold moisture.  Wonderful product and I&#x27;ll be sure to order more when this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I started using this product two weeks ago. Once a day for a week and now twice followed by a light SPF moisturizer.  My fine lines are GONE. Skin tone even as never before. Pores are smaller and my dark circles are gone. This is a miracle serum. Can&#x27;t wait till they come out with the moisturizer cream.</li>
    <li> I received both products per date stated. Both products are to my satisfaction. I could even see a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance in just two days use. I love the natural organic ingredients in this product and will continue with this line. Thank you TruSkin Naturals.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum! I could notice a difference after just the first use! Also they have excellent customer service! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> ever since i started using the serums, my face has gotten brighter and more even! I&#x27;ve never seen my skin as even, i have hyper pigmentation due to a lot of acne scars and just because i have dark skin, so my mouth, eyes, and nose tend to have dark areas around them. I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement in those areas. also I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my eye area, my eyes used to have dry patches under them, but now those are gone. Also my left eyelid creased differently than my right, making it appear smaller than the other (It folds a it differently), ever since I&#x27;ve incorporated the serums into my routine this has been gone!! I really like that because i used to hate it because my eye make up never looked right, now both of my eyes look hydrated and awake. Also i am very oily and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduced amount of oil on my face (usually i can tell when i wear make up because its very obvious)&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I know that&#x27;s a lot of good things but its actually very true! I am 18 and to be honest I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would help me but now I think its a must! I feel a lot more confident without makeup on, and even more confident with it on because my made up face looks improved because of my skin improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing negative it that it seems to go through pretty fast, like i feel like i&#x27;m halfway through and its been like only about a month. I don&#x27;t know if i can afford to keep replenishing my supply (I&#x27;m on a college budget) but i will sure try! I&#x27;ll think for the results its pretty worth it but it just can go fast.&lt;br /&gt; They have WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE! Love the attention I can get as a customer, they don&#x27;t forget about you even long after you&#x27;ve bought the product.  Overall i&#x27;m very satisfied so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for three months and I&#x27;m not noticing any real changes....especially in the brown spots. make my skin feel good so I&#x27;ll probably keep using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is miraculous!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had bad skin for....EVER!!! PCOS and hormonal acne stinks!&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never been so smooth!!! Also, my smiles lines have diminished tremendously!&lt;br /&gt;I so appreciate this serum and the company is very focused on customer service too!!</li>
    <li> I have received compliments about my appearance using this serum.  It is easy to apply but one must be disciplined to use it daily to see results...</li>
    <li> One of the best concentrate vitamin C . loved it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such a healthy change in my skin in such a short time. I&#x27;m 62 and my hands look it. But after using your Vit C serum, the skin on my hands is less translucent, more thick, and my facial wrinkles are less deep. Amazing. Thank you for all your efforts to make and keep this a truly potent product. I&#x27;m gifting it, and your Hyaluronic Acid serum, to a girlfriend at her 50th birthday party.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 months, almost twice a day (I forget sometimes).  while, I can&#x27;t say with absolute certainty- since I use other products to my face- this serum definitely seems to improve with brightness of my skin and very fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is very little scent to the serum- which I like and it is not thick or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it following toning my skin, before any moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has gone fast, faster than other products- so I need to order soon.  While I do think this was great, I may try another brand to see if there is a difference.</li>
    <li> I have never suffered with acne until I became an adult/ mom! With it came an uneven skin tone due to acne marks. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is severe , but to ME it seemed like it! When I decided to go the natural and organic route with my skin care products was after a lifestyle change. I found the Vitamin C serum and it&#x27;s been LOVE ever since!!! I rate it high up there with professional skin care that I&#x27;ve spent more money on! I can see a change in my skin tone, texture and clarity! I&#x27;ve been using it for months and I try to make sure I never run out of it and I can for the first time term something as my &amp;#34; Holy Grail&amp;#34;! Customer service is AWESOME and orders arrive quickly which is always a plus! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product or really the whole line as I&#x27;ve also ordered the eye gel ( amazing!) and the retinol. I will forever be a loyal customer and I love seeing the brightness of my skin and feeling the smoothness after I wash my face with my spin brush. Try these products and I promise you won&#x27;t regret nor look back!!!</li>
    <li> It seems to be balancing overall skin tone, oil production, &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; that causes a natural radiance, and may even be lightening small scars from pimples and years of sun damage. Im only using it once a day, at night before bed- so I would expect there to be even more results if I were to use also during the day.</li>
    <li> Just started my second bottle and there is definitely an improvement.  My skin is smoother and plumper.  Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  It is refreshing to use a product that actually makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.  I&#x27;m looking forward to continuing improvement.  This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Have you ever had liquid on your face and it felt just like silk even after it dried? Well TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C is really true to their name. My face is lighter, healthier and even have a glow. I got a little mirror in my pocketbook and I be eye balling my own self, especially after all the compliments I&#x27;ve been getting. I&#x27;ll be 60 yrs old in a few months and my face is not scared at all.  When my friends mention 60 I get a little anxious but my FACE say, You came a long way baby! The calender might say 60 but this liquid silk is saying 30 in my eyes!  Not to mention it have vitamin C and E! I&#x27;m not looking nowhere else!</li>
    <li> So far I am liking this&lt;br /&gt; product!  It seems to have helped even out my skin tone&lt;br /&gt; and texture. It has also helped my forehead lines to not be&lt;br /&gt; as noticeable as well. I do like the price and think that&lt;br /&gt; its fair. Thank you for a nice product!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and plan to continue to use it.  It applies well, absorbs quickly and completely, does not make my skin oily, and does not have an overt fragrance.  All good things for me, and my skin seems brighter already!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really love my skin...I am 68 years young and was getting a &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34;; also lines above my lip.  I can honestly say I see a firmness starting under my chin.  I am still working on the lines above my lip.  My skin feels so soft and luminous. I use the product morning and night and will continue to do so.  Thank you very much..I am excited.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t notice the immediate results that the advertisement for this product mentions may happen upon using the product the first time, I have noticed that my skin is brighter and looks healthier.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product for two weeks but, with what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;m willing to give it the full month before I make my final decision about it.  Regarding the service, I was sent an email from a TruSkin Naturals employee making sure that I received the product and understood how best to use it.  She also answered my questions within one day so they are certainly standing behind their product.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> After using the serum twice daily for almost 2 to 3 weeks I feel like  my skin is getting firmer &amp; smoother.  Work in progress.  However, I love the first results.  This is  good stuff.  I love it, love it, love it...Dr OZ and TruSkin Thank you for this pure smooth products.</li>
    <li> I love the serum. My skin looks fabulously radiant and has actually cleared significantly since I started using the serum.  My skin is smooth and the fine lines have diminished.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using TruSkin C for 3 weeks and can really tell a difference!  I live in the north and it has really been cold.  I usually use a moisturizer at night and in the mornings but have found using Vitamin C Serum I now only usemy  moisturizer in the mornings.  My face is smooth and clear and my skin seems firmer.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this product. It gives you more firmness (most obvious point) and more brightness, just generally better looking skin. I never thought that a product could do that. It works extremely well. I use it in the evenings and when I get up in the morning my skin does not look tired at all, as it used to before. My best find ever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great. It helped fade my hyperpigmentation that was caused by acne and acne medication. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks and I have noticed my face is much much smoother. It took awhile for immediate results but I have now been using the serum twice a day and I am noticing that my acne scars are fading. I also love that the company emails me and asks my personal experience with their product, it makes it feel more personal and like they really care about the results of thier product. I will continue to buy this especially because it is a great price for something that works remarkable!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to reduce fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes.  I have very sensitive skin and am allergic several well known brands of make up, so finding something that had the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid for sensitive skin was challenging.  This product was very reasonably priced and had excellent reviews.  I think I was blessed with good skin but after living in the desert climate for nine  years, it has started to take a toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this about three weeks ago. First, just once a day for two weeks; once I started to see changes in my skin with no adverse reaction; I moved to twice a week.  So, far I have been very pleased with the results.  There is a definite change in the fine lines around my eyes and those beginning wrinkles which are a little more deep set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t often write reviews either, but this is a very good product for someone with sensitive skin.  The results appear quickly and I will continue to use this with the hopes of even greater results.  The customer service is excellent on follow up and handling questions - another perk that we don&#x27;t often receive from even the stores today!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really brightens my skin.</li>
    <li> I may be overly optimistic, but it seems to be working wonders after only a few applications!</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this product! It did wonders to my skin, gave me a brighter, healthier look! Am loving it! Great customer service, this product is a keeper!</li>
    <li> So far I like the serum. It makes my skin brighter and I hope for more results with continued use.</li>
    <li> My skin feels much softer and I&#x27;m noticing my dark spots have gotten a little lighter which I think is great for having only used it for a week and half once a day, I have great expectations for this product and will continue to use it, thanks again.</li>
    <li> My face definitely seems clearer after starting this product!</li>
    <li> The people who represent or own this company are very  professional and actually write to you directly.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for some brown spots and a little melasa.  Just a few drops and your face feels smooth.  I have started using it 2x per day as recommended.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough but will continue to have it as my only night regimen.  Less is more especially with something so good for your skin as written lately in a lot of magazines and recommended by dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bee using this for about 3 weeks now and have noticed no difference.  I used another product similar to this one awhile back and it really worked.  Threw the bottle away and can&#x27;t remember the name of it.</li>
    <li> My skin is definitely feeling smoother and softer than before. ​My skin tone is less blotchy and I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in irritation or acne. I like that it spreads very easily over my face. I apply it right out of the shower when my face is still moist, one drop on each cheek and one on my forehead. Works pretty well, and I didn&#x27;t feel any filmy texture once it dried, so that was awesome, because I apply my sunscreen moisturizer on top of it. There&#x27;s nothing I dislike about it right now.</li>
    <li> Really nice product.  Has really made a difference in my skin and I intend to continue to use it every day.</li>
    <li> The serum is working great.  I have been using other brands of Vitamin C serums for a long time, but they are more expensive so I decided to switch and try yours.  It seems to be every bit as good as the others and I like the price so I’ll continue to use it.  I also mentioned it to a friend of mine who may be ordering from you.</li>
    <li> This serum is a rare case when the product is exactly like it was advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 of these already (1 for my mom) and that&#x27;s why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, like it happened with another serum I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I guess its the first time when I really-really noticed the result of using some skin product. My skin became very soft and smooth just after a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It&#x27;s really not sticky or greasy. I don&#x27;t feel like its too much for my skin when I apply serum+moisturizer/cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) All natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Good price, so I can apply as much and as often as I really need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly high quality product for an amazingly low price.</li>
    <li> Customer service with this company is top notch !! I am so very impressed with their guarantee and true desire to make you happy and see that your needs are met.&lt;br /&gt;The Product didn&#x27;t work ideally for my skin type but the service is top of the line and Im so pleased with such a decent company. Thank you and best wishes.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not notice any difference in my skin after using it. I will not buy again</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome. Easy to put on and feels good afterwards. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see big differences, but the little signs are encouraging. Delivery time was great, just a few days after the order.  Thanks for the personal product advice for the use of these products.</li>
    <li> This works better than the chemical based serum I bought to clarify my face of dark spots.  Use it nightly, don&#x27;t skip.</li>
    <li> I am a male in my 70&#x27;s. I tried TruSkin to lighten some dark spots around my eyes. I have dark skin. Made even darker that I live in Florida and am out in the sun playing tennis. I use TruSkin twice a day. The dark spots have faded. I have not been using it long and am curious to see if the spots will  futher improve. One difference with this product is that a representative will contact you  and will be very concerned about your progress. He/she will keep in touch with you to monitor your progress. I can&#x27;t say I have had this experience with any other product sold to me over the internet. Other products have not worked that well. I highly recommend TruSkin. I wish they had a product that made me look like I was 28 again but I don&#x27;t believe there is a product on the market that will accomplish that. TruSkin has no odor which is nice. It goes on clear. Does not burn my eyes like some creams do. Try it!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well.  I have some discoloration I&#x27;m hoping will fade with continued use.  I do like it and will continue to use it.  Nice to get an email from Erica to check and see how it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> love it! the skin absorb it in 1 minute, perfect for my fast pace life!</li>
    <li> So far I really like it.  I use it every morning under sunscreen moisturizer.  I have noticed a smoother brighter complexion and imperfections such as large pores and dark sun spots are minimizing.  I am also using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum&lt;br /&gt;in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied and will continue to purchase both on a regular basis.  These are now my primary moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I have good results so far</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Have only been using a short time. I like the consistency of the serums, and feeling of my skin after using. Nothing that I dislike at this point. Great products for the money and very good service, and I will order again.</li>
    <li> I searched for a product with hyaluronic acid and vitamin C and finally found this. It goes on smoothly, feels nice, not sticky or thick. I&#x27;ve had sensitive and problematic skin all my life but this is giving me no trouble at all. It makes my skin look smooth, I put it on my neck and chest as well. I&#x27;ve been using it at night but I&#x27;m going to start using it in the mornings as well.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time today.  Right away I was amazed.  Just a few drops went on easily and absorbed quickly.  Instantly I could feel my face firming up, but without that tightness you get after using a product with alcohol in it.  I used a light moisturizer afterwards, and was amazed at how much better my makeup went on. I can&#x27;t wait to see more great results after using it for awhile.  I am in my early 70&#x27;s with the usual lines you get from aging. Hopefully I will be able to notice an improvement easily. I will report back on how it goes!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t that great to use. Waist of money to me.</li>
    <li> Again, I prefer creme and lotions to oil however, felt it was a very good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything beneficial to my skin. It didn&#x27;t do any harm and it was worth trying. I won&#x27;t buy it again. I will try another vitamin c product to compare.</li>
    <li> I am in my 4 th bottle so I believe I qualify to write a review. This serum is great. I have sensitive combination skin. I usually get reactions from almost all the products that touch my face. I like to try new products I am always in the search for the perfect skin. All the previous vitamin C serums I had tried really irritated me skin. Not this one. My skin is smooth and brighter. It took 3 weeks to start seeing a difference. The true test was when my first bottle finished. I was out of the product and just a week later huge difference in my skin. Since then I religiously wear it every morning under my spf moisturizer. I like the product so much I bought the huyaluronic acid as well. Another fantastic product which I will review separately. I love the vitamin C serum is a must in my skin routine and the price is great. Give it a chance and try it.</li>
    <li> Wow,  so far I love this product..I&#x27;m keeping pictures of my face and I will be using them</li>
    <li> My wife say that&#x27;s the product I was looking for</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me... I used 2 bottles.</li>
    <li> Used for almost 3 weeks and don&#x27;t see any change.  will not repurchase</li>
    <li> Never used a moisturizer because they all seemed to break me out.  I use this at night only on my face, neck,  and under my eyes.  Does not break me out.  Hydrates, absorbs well, and my skin looks better I think. Light texture.  Not greasy. I could not use this during the day.  It does have some oil and my skin needs break from that. I have reordered.</li>
    <li> I love this product, after using it for one month I can see the results.  Just ordered 2 more bottles.  Would not want to be without.</li>
    <li> So far the serum works really great on my skin. It has made it more smoother and young looking. I have asked my husband to try it. He&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Very particular on anything he puts on his face. But with the serum he said its ok. Guess that i have to order another one real soon. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;For checking on me. I really appreciate it. Its a good product.</li>
    <li> This Serum has wonderful repairing agents for damaged skin. I will definitely buy again and again!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this serum is that it isn&#x27;t sticky or tacky like other Vitamin C serums that I&#x27;ve tried.  My skin drinks it up, and seems to like it quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I loved it. I actually also ordered a different one from Amazon the same day, Ole Henriksen. Although it was highly recommended I liked Tru Skin Naturals better. I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry so quickly and it allows for just a small drop to cover my whole face.  I also saw a difference in the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This product really brings out the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; in my skin.  I have also noticed that my skin is smoother and feels softer to the touch.  I use this product in the morning and then followup with my moisturizer.  I can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing it under my makeup.  A great buy!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a vitamin C serum that contained 20 percent hyaluronic acid. I read a few and decided to go with TruSkin. After ordering it the seller contacted me to thank me a let me know when I could be expecting it. I received it right on time. I was very excited to start using it. The seller contacted me again to go over the proper way of using the serum. She made things very clear and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. After spending $100 dollars on miracle creams. I&#x27;m very happy to find something so simple that will save money and I&#x27;ve seen a difference. The difference in my face is the biggest difference.</li>
    <li> I am in my 30s and I have been using TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks now. I absolutely love it! The fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead are a lot less noticeable and my skin is really soft and radiant. I have made it a part of my after shower skin care regimen both in the morning and at night. The serum soaks into my skin and dries quickly. I notice that I am also using less moisturizer than usual. My moisturizer seems to be soaking into my skin a lot better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from psoriasis and have sensitive, combination skin. When I had heard about the benefits of hyaluronic acid combined with vitamin C and how great it is to treat texture, hydration and fine lines, I HAD to try it. Also, because my skin is so sensitive, I wanted a natural product that was chemical free. This serum was perfect for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of my skin has noticeably improved. My friends and family have all been complimenting me on how great my skin looks I am very happy with the results on my face. I&#x27;ve tried many other wrinkle creams that claimed to make a difference, but this is the only product that I have used that has actually made a noticeable difference. I highly recommend this product for a more youthful and radiant appearance!</li>
    <li> I love this product. This Vitamin C Serum does not irritate my skin.  My skin for the first time in years  feels soft and  smooth and looks great.  My skin is much firmer.  It absorbs quickly, goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  I would recommend this product .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family thinks I may have gotten a face lift.</li>
    <li> I love it my skin looks great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum twice a day for the past 3 days. Last night my boyfriend said my skin looked amazing. It shrinks my pores and makes my skin absolutely glow. I love love love it and I&#x27;m about to buy another bottle right now just so I never run out.  I knew vitamin c was great for your skin but I think a large part of the success is due to the hyaluronic acid because I&#x27;ve used the vitimin Serums in the past but never with such stunning results. Does anyone know anything about this acid, where it comes from? What it does? I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WITH DULL UNEVEN SKIN TONES. IT HAS EVEN HELPED WITH MY ACNE. IT&#x27;S ... AMAZING.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!!!  As a busy mom I don&#x27;t have time for anything in my beauty regimen that is not pulling it&#x27;s weight.  But I use this product twice a day and my skin looks and feels great!!!  I am always trying new products and I am sticking with this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m truly satisfied with my purchase..I am so happy that I found this serum and for the few weeks of using this serum I really noticed my skin feel so soft and bright. My Acne scars are fading and I don&#x27;t have breakouts. I would definitely purchase another bottle soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  And also, Erica, the Co-Founder, Of Truskin Naturals sent me a new bottle as a gift ,and I am so thankful ! Such a great customer service.</li>
    <li> Love that I can see a difference in my skin after one week. Had a spot under my eye and it has cleared up. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> love the Serum. I purchased the product originally for my forehead because I noticed some lines on it. After a few days I started noticing the difference. My skin seemed much brighter and the lines seemed to disappear. I was pleased with the results on my forehead, so I started using the serum on my entire face. The funny thing is, about 1 week ago I went to the dermatologist office concerned about a bump that would not go away, which I learned was a mole. Long story short the Dr asked what was my skin regimen, my response was I wash my face with Clinique Salicylic soap bar and I use a Serum C. He responded keep doing what you&#x27;re doing because your skin looks great. With such a response from the Dr I know that I made no mistakes with this purchase. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I saw some other reviews that this serum made their skin feel dry, they are not educated on skin care... After applying this product to clean face you must allow it to dry. This is when your skin might feel &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s really not. Then you apply moisturizer over it to lock in all the nutrients. I felt and saw noticeable results after 3 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has very sensitive skin and gets breakouts but this product (along with washing face twice daily and moisturizing after) has really improved his skin!&lt;br /&gt;I love the serum! My skin is extremely soft, my pores are smaller and the overall brightness of my face is better! I will be buying more</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin as many other reviewers have mentioned in their reviews. My skin doesn&#x27;t really seem much different than it did before I started using this serum, and I have now been using it for over a month.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, my face is so soft and brighter after using it!</li>
    <li> Perfect skin after applying this serum. Really liked it!</li>
    <li> Very small bottle, lasted me about 2 weeks, I used it morning and night on sum acne scars and did not see any improvement with my skin during the time I used this product, felt like I just wasted my money on this.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before, but am happy to do so for this company and for this product.  First I did not notice a difference in my skin right away.  But after 4 weeks, I noticed my skin was really smooth, my dark spots under my eyes are gone, my face is virtually pore free and there is just a general glow.    Second, the customer service is the best!  Third, the bottle lasts for 5 to 6 weeks, so the price is spot on for my budget!   I will be making for Christmas gifts for the all of the women in our family.    You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product 3 weeks ago.  I use it as directed--after cleansing &amp; toner.  My skin is getting smoother.  It works!  I will continue to use it. Pam K.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product.  makes my skin feel super smooth and firmer and softens lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Been using this for roughly three weeks now. Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but my pores are slightly smaller and my overall appearance seems a little brighter so it must be working. Hopefully, in a few months my pores will shrink significantly. Also, hoping it will diminish my acne scars and even my skin tone. No dice on that yet, but I have hope. I&#x27;ve also cleaned up my diet so we&#x27;ll see in a few months.</li>
    <li> I love the Serum and I will order it again.  I have used a couple different ones before using TruSkin; I do like TruSkin the best.  I use it in the morning before make up and at night before I go to bed.  I put it in the palm of my left hand and then put it on with my right hand.  After I am done I rub may hands together and apply it to my neck.  My face looks brighter, soft and smooth, but I started to notice that the palms of my hands were having the same result...fewer lines...! It works...just stick with it...you will have a Happy face.</li>
    <li> A very good product. It really works.</li>
    <li> I love the serum and my skin feels wonderful, I think it is helping with dark spots and under my eyes.  I am 48, still break out, but this stuff feels great.  I think even my eyelids feel less droopy!  I have recommended it to my friends and sisters. :)  I am so happy it is affordable too!!  I have ordered twice now.</li>
    <li> Going to continue to use this to see if I get any results.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> product has a nice celan smell, goes on easily, pleasant feeling. Customer service is top notch and great infromation welcome email! The dropper does pull in air -so i have to tilt the bottle a little so i dont&#x27; get bubbles</li>
    <li> Already on my four bottle! Amazing stuff! My mother and I both use it and love it so much! Definitely a staple in my skin care routine!</li>
    <li> I tried one of your competitors’ products, PureBody Naturals, and there was no comparison to your Vitamin C Serum. I have just reordered yours from Amazon and I will stay with your serum without “straying&amp;#34; again!  In all honesty, I tried the other product because there was a slight difference in price but I confirmed what my father always told me, “You get what you pay for!”  Thanks again for producing a great Vitamin C Serum.  My face and neck are 76 years old so this is a true test for the quality of your product. You can&#x27;t make a silk purse out of a sow&#x27;s ear but I do think that my skin looks younger than it did before I discovered TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> I just turned 40. I love that people say I&#x27;m looking younger. Honestly, I have noticed a gradual and steady change in my complexion in the last month that I&#x27;ve been using TruSkin Vit. C serum. I&#x27;ve struggled for a long time with having large pores and black heads. I&#x27;m loving this product and company! Thanks so much! I&#x27;ve tried many products and this is truly the first that has helped. I love the natural ingredients and plan to continue using this product as long as my skin is loving it too.</li>
    <li> I have NEVER experienced such outstanding customer service!! I honestly cannot speak highly enough about my personal experience with TruSkin Naturals!! As for the Vitamin C serum, it is working miracles for my husband&#x27;s excessively dry skin on his face and my oily skin is showing less fine lines &amp; a more even color tone on my face. I have horrid scars on my face from repeated breakouts when I was a teenager that are also slowly, but surely disappearing as well! The serum is very lightweight, I use it under my makeup without the slightest heavy or tacky feeling. I highly recommend this product &amp; the company as well!!!</li>
    <li> My Wife thinks this is great</li>
    <li> I had used another Vitamin C Serum, and thought it was great BUT WOW! This one is amazing!!!  I emailed the owner directly to tell her how much I loved this product. Very easy to apply, no smell, and results within 2 days. I have &amp;#34;tough skin&amp;#34; (i.e. it&#x27;s used to a lot of treatment) so I was able to apply 2-3 times in one evening. My skin is already glowing! Love it and I will try the other products from this line immediately. I am almost 51 - but look lots younger than my age - this will help even more! YAY!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving it! My skin feels smoother and it seems that my discolorations are lessening.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews before purchasing the serum. The price was right and it seemed worth a try. I had a large, rough brown spot on my check, about an inch long, but not as wide. My skin is sensitive and very fair. I do tan or did in the past. Also have rosacea, but the area of concern is outside that. My dermatologist had tried to freeze it off; several years ago, it also had been professionally attacked using a laser. Nothing really worked on a long-term basis. However, this serum has done a miraculous job. Over several months, applied once a day, the serum has lightened the spot so that it is smoother, much lighter, and less noticeable. Truthfully, I think with make-up it would be invisible. It has also reduced the color of a few other age spots. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Bear in mind that this has taken awhile. The serum is not an instantaneous cure. I suspect if I tossed it out, the spot would return. So, let&#x27;s hope and pray it continues to be available.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for two weeks and am fully satisfied with this product. My skin tone is improved, looks and feels better. I&#x27;ve used other serums on the market, this is a great product for the money. My estetcian told me a good serum absorbs into the skin vs laying on top of the skin. This is a quality product! Will purchase again &amp; want to try other products from this line.</li>
    <li> Your serum is amazing. Since the first week using it, I noticed my pores getting smaller. My skin looks fresher. I don&#x27;t have a problem with sunspots but I was starting to get a couple of them and now they are gone. Thanks again for such a great product and at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> the product does smooth out fine lines and is easy to use/however do not expect miracles...el fed</li>
    <li> After using this serum for two weeks I have noted a positive significant change in the texture of my skin.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff. It makes me look younger! It took only 2 or 3 days of using it twice a day, and I noticed a more toned skin. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, and it&#x27;s not oily. I even put it on my hands, and they look better too.</li>
    <li> WOW!  This is a really great product.  Your face feels healthy glowing.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Wow, I keep thinking I&#x27;m not looking in the proper light. I don&#x27;t use it that often, but hey. It&#x27;s definitely making a difference.</li>
    <li> This particular product by this manufacturer  does not work. One of its primary ingredients, hyaluronic acid, is of  proven benefit to the skin. I actually often add HA ( you can buy bottles of pure HA at a reasonable cost from many reputable sellers)  to other liquid skin moisturizers I have purchased but were not satisfied with and then noticed  an improved performance so I know HA works. My guess is that there is just too little of it in here. If there were as much as there needs to be, you would notice the salutary effects   quite quickly. Even after three weeks of constant use there was absolutely no improvement in my skin.  As I often do, I asked a fellow cosmetics maven to give it a try. Her opinion was the same as mine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE it, just ordered my second bottle.  Told my boss about it and she loves it too.   It&#x27;s cheap defense against the signs of aging.</li>
    <li> The feel of this serum is very nice. Thick enough not to run, light enough to not feel heavy, and is not at all sticky. Absorbs 100%, unlike some others that just lay on top of skin and ball up if you rub your fingers across your face after they&#x27;ve dried. This one makes skin feel firmer but doesn&#x27;t ball up at all of you try to rub it off  I&#x27;ve only use this serum 3 times so I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in, or improvements to, my skin yet, but I did notice today as I was applying it for the 3rd time that my bottle is only about 2/3 full. Since I&#x27;ve used barely a dropper per application, it had to mean the bottle wasn&#x27;t full when I received it but that I didn&#x27;t notice until today. :-/ Maybe this product just doesn&#x27;t come with a full bottle? Will update my review after I&#x27;ve used it a few more times if I do notice any differences in my skin. Order did come very quickly in the mail, though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this.  I was hoping it would help with fine lines and wrinkles, but it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I will stick to my Clinique.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my mom and she loves it so far, she is in her early 50&#x27;s and has a few sun spots. She lives 8 hours away from me, but she told me she noticed that they are diminishing and the overall appearance of her skin looks good. She loves how soft it makes her skin feel and has also mentioned seeing her skin appear more firm. She is very happy with the product and will be ordering it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I just turned 50 and have been looking for more pure products that provide the best quality and results with few chemicals. I ordered this and am very happy with it. I put a few drops in with my moisturizer and use it several times a week. My sisters have mentioned how my skin looks more vibrant and healthy, and now I can get away with wearing little to now make up! Customer service is also excellent, and available to answer questions to help maximize the use of the product! Thank you TruSkin Naturals!</li>
    <li> This product is great! It is good as a standalone product or with your favorite moisturizer.  I will be using it again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks TruSkin</li>
    <li> Since i have been .using truskin vitamin  c serum  my skin has becme smoother  and clearer</li>
    <li> I already order the second bottle last 2 weeks from Amazon  :-) because I use every time when I wash my face, that work for my very sensitive and Dry skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m already seeing clearer skin tone with the Vitamin C Serum &amp; Hyaluronic Acid after 1 week, and my eyeshadow looks so much better.  I had delicate papery skin above my eyelids and it made me look old when I wore eyeshadow.  But now my eyeshadow looks normal.  The redness in my skin has diminished as well.  I had deep wrinkles in my decollete area from sun damage &amp; age (in my 50&#x27;s), and they are gone!!!  I&#x27;m using the Vitamin C Serum &amp; the Hyaluronic Acid twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good (mentally &amp; physically on my skin) to use healthy products that don&#x27;t have a lot of extra chemicals in them.  I&#x27;m looking forward to more benefits over time!</li>
    <li> Takes years off your face</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> One of the best Vitamin C serum in the market. It doesn&#x27;t take long to see immediate change on your face. I love how much brighter my face look but you need to be consistent in using this serum to get great results. This one is definitely a keeper:)</li>
    <li> I am over 60 years of age and needless to say, have a lot of old wrinkles!  I have been using this product for a month now and am starting to see positive results.  While my wrinkles are not going to disappear, they seem to be less noticeable since using the serum.  Application of the product is easy and the product dries very quickly.  I have sensitive skin and have had absolutely no problems such as irritation or redness using the product.  Customer Service for this company is amazing.  They called me after I had been using the product for a few weeks to see if I was happy with the product.  I will definitely order the serum again!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with adult acne for several years and I swear this serum has been like a miracle for my skin! I noticed a huge difference within the first week. My skin began not just clearing up, but firming up as well. I&#x27;m so happy I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about twice a day for a month and I haven&#x27;t seen any changes to my skin or dark spots. I like the fact that this product doesn&#x27;t smell bad or doesn&#x27;t stain cloth like other dark spot removers but if it doesn&#x27;t help, then it&#x27;s not worth still using it.</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels better!</li>
    <li> Kind of harsh on my face but I am using it on cuts and heals beautifully. It&#x27;s just to drying for my face skin type.</li>
    <li> I love using it...I have brown spots and those will take time to fade but being able to see a visible difference in overall tone is wonderful.  Just to be able to use an natural product that works this good for such a small price is amazing!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that leaves your face very hydrated.</li>
    <li> This product is ok so far</li>
    <li> This is really great I have used this both day and night and definitely see a difference in skin texture.  Very reasonable and works.</li>
    <li> Ordered for 70 y o mom.  1 drop goes a long way..... ; )</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum and I really love it! I have gotten many compliments on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is really light and it doesn&#x27;t make my face break out as many face serums or creams do.  I bought this to try because I was sick of the over priced drugstore creams that take forever to see any results. Within one week I saw a difference I am very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I am using this as a part of my nighttime skin regimen and after a few weeks can see the difference in the overall appearance of my skin.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have had some hormonal skin issues and this Vitamin C seems to be making a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth the money to try!</li>
    <li> Have noticed a definite improvement in my 64 yr old skin. I &#x27;ve always had good skin, but in just one week I noticed improved texture &amp; a smoother complexion, lessening of the few wrinkles I had. Have not noticed any lessening of brown spots, yet, but it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks.   UPDATE 8/15: great for my skin, but, in my case, NO lightening of any facial spots.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of a Vitamin C serum to be used on my skin. This seems to be a quality product and I use it every other day. Erica, from TruSkin Naturals has contacted me twice to see if I am satisfied with the product, it is nice to know there are still companies that care about their customers. Wonderful experience!</li>
    <li> I like the product and saw almost immediate results under my eyes and with fine lines. It helps with dry skin too. I even use it on top of by bald head to brighten my dull skin. You guys are doing a great job.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> So far, I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice daily since I&#x27;ve received it approximately 10 days ago. I can already notice a difference in the way my face/neck looks and feels. I absolutely love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Every women over 40 need this.I have been using this product for about a month i notice that the dark circle was fading under my eyes, was so happy; i hardly use my mac eye concealer my skin appears to be more radiant and clearer, move over Mac, this Oranic C serum will be taking your place.............</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I have noticed an overall improvement in the appearance of age spots, fine lines and wrinkles. This serum goes on nicely and goes a long way as well. It gives my face a warm summer glow. This is a great bargain compared to similar products out there  Thank you for a wonderful product Erica.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, unscented and luxurious.  I love using this product.  My skin looks and feels better.</li>
    <li> I applied in the morning &amp; night it makes my face brighter &amp; smoother</li>
    <li> this is truly amazing....i can see results already..really helps deep wrinkles alot...i can hardly wait to see end result...yea</li>
    <li> Love this product! Skin is looking so much better! Delivers what it promises!</li>
    <li> I am in awe! I can&#x27;t believe this! It is amazing ! I have only been using this for three days and most of my blotchy dark patches are gone! I am sixty-five years old,  light skinned and light eyes, used to be blonde, now my hair is like dishwater blonde (ugly).  This product far exceeds my expectations! Delivery was fast too. As I said above, I have only used this for three days, so I will update later. I can&#x27;t wait to see future results! I highly recommend this product!  I&#x27;m back to update. I love this product! So happy I discovered it! My skin feels amazing. I have been using concealer on the dark spots, but yesterday after putting on my makeup, I discovered I forgot to put the concealer on! And it actually looked great (if I do say so myself)! I love that the seller personally contacted me to see if I was pleased with the product. Nice personal touch! She actually sent advice on how to use this product with other products. This was very helpful to me, a first time user. Luv luv this product! Highly recommend to anyone checking it out!</li>
    <li> my skin was really damaged so I know it&#x27;s going to take a while to get to the point that I really want, but I have already seen results after just a couple of weeks. I do not sun bath at all and haven&#x27;t for the last 10+ years but I do have some damage from when I did sunbathe without using sun block. Love this serum it is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Very happy! I had a facial a few weeks ago and they tried to sell me vitamin c serum for major $$$. I found yours on amazon and I am just as happy with it as the samples they gave me. I have already recommended your product to about 10 friends and several have told me they have ordered. Thanks for a great affordable product!</li>
    <li> I just received my Vitamin C serum in the mail yesterday. I used it for the first time last night and I am so impressed with this product! I don&#x27;t think that I am imagining things as I am very critical of my skin, but I already see improvement in my skin after just one use. This is a fabulous product and I can&#x27;t wait to see the benefits of the vitamin C serum in the coming weeks. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I give this vitamin c serum 5 stars because it really is the best vitamin c serum out there.  It goes on so easily, sinks into my skin and after just one use I noticed a difference.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day since it arrived and my skin is smoother, clearer, and softer.  To think one product could do that and more!  It also cleared up some blemishes and seems to be keeping them away, and makes fine lines and wrinkles appear softer, less noticeable.  For me, this serum is hands down 100% better than philosophy booster c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this to several friends and my 5 sisters so they have already purchased it I hope, because I&#x27;m not sharing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be reordering when my supply is half gone, just to make sure I always have it on hand.  Great product, great company!</li>
    <li> Have been using a Vitamin C serum followed by a Hyaluronic Acid serum capsule for years and have been happy with the result.  I needed to replace the Vitamin C and saw this on Amazon, at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with this one step solution.  In addition to the C and Hyaluronic Acid, the serum has Vitamin E in it.  The three ingredients absorb very quickly, without a greasy feel afterward, and my skin just loves it! Skin tone is beautiful and my skin feels so very soft after I apply it...and continues throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was incredibly quick (as a Prime member, I&#x27;ve come to expect it, but we were in the midst of a major winter storm!) and the packaging, while simple, looks like it came from a high end spa.  All in all, a good buy!</li>
    <li> My skin is much brighter after using this product for several weeks.</li>
    <li> still too early to tell....  But feels good on my face.</li>
    <li> not really impressed...... does it take longer or is something else needed with it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C Serum for a few weeks and I love it!  My skin feels smoother and my age spots are already fading.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Has diminished my pores greatly and fewer blackheads. I really like this product and have ordered the larger size! :-) Looking forward to even more improvements over time. Great service and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my skin soft and nourished.</li>
    <li> I listened to Doctor Radio on Sirius XM and a dermatologist said that of all the products out there that are bogus for our skin, Vitamin C is not. That is why I bought this product. I was pleasantly surprised when it helped two blotches on my face I got from the sun. It is odorless, easy to put on, absorbs quickly, and does not have a  greasy feeling. I wear it under my make up and it does not interfere with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this also for two of my friends who have suffered from sun damage and they are pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Initially, I was using way too much. The glass dropper is enough to cover my entire face and neck/chest area twice. Very little is required and the results are just as effective. I had deep &amp;#34;III&amp;#34; on my forehead and for the past month, I have noticed them decreasing. I am a fan!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased and happy with the TruSkin products - I see some improvement already!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I have tried a few other serums before, but I like this one the best. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it. I like the serum is not too thick or too liquidy, feel like my skin absorb it good.</li>
    <li> Enjoying this product and seeing changes!</li>
    <li> I had been reading that vitamins C, A, and E were good for your facial skin and to reduce fine wrinkles.  Also I&#x27;ve used Hyaluronic Acid for several years and it is excellent for my skin.  This product, in serum form seemed to be just what I wanted.  Directions say to massage onto face, allow to dry and then use your regular moisturizer.  I did exactly that and the next morning my face seemed very dry.  I used it again that morning.  By that night washing my face it seemed very dry again.  In the morning my face was so taut that I had deeper creases than normal on my upper lip and deep naso-labial creases with a lot of &amp;#34;checked&amp;#34; lines radiating out.  This product being a serum I though I&#x27;d give it one more try and it did help smooth out all the deeper wrinkles of that morning but so would any good moisturizer.  That night my skin felt so rough, I knew that was it.  Plus they recommend using it 3 or more times a day and as they said in an email they sent me: &amp;#34;Optimal results are achieved in about 6-8 months and can be maintained with continuous use.&amp;#34;  Better part of a YEAR before you see good results???????  I&#x27;d have to order one of these little 1 oz. bottles about every 2-3 weeks.  (Or order 15-18 bottles at once)  Supposedly it contains hyaluronic acid but it didn&#x27;t feel like it.  Hyaluronic acid draws moisture to your skin but mine sure wasn&#x27;t moist!!  I won&#x27;t use any more of this product and can&#x27;t in good conscience recommend it to any one else.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Makes my skin so soft! I will continue to use over time! Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the serum for a few weeks but within a few days of starting, it made my skin much smoother. I am in my 60&#x27;s and have very dry skin and even exfoliating and using moisturizers everyday it still felt tight and flaky. I can see so much difference in my skin already and it doesn&#x27;t have that tight feel to it now, nor does it have flakiness. Great product and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> After using the TruSkin Naturals Serum for the past two weeks, i have notice my skin is looking smoother and feels softer,  Will be ordering my next supply soon</li>
    <li> still waiting for something to happen.</li>
    <li> delivery was on time and exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> It is a little thicker than Obaji serum but if it does the job it will be excellent especially for the price</li>
    <li> I purchased TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C serum December 19th and I&#x27;ve got to say it&#x27;s working really good. I apply it mostly twice a day over my whole entire face and neck and I have notice my skin is a lot softer and I&#x27;ve been applying it to my fine lines too. I&#x27;m currently using tretinoin at night and benzoyl peroxide during the day in conjunction with the vitamin c serum. I have noticed my acne has gone down a lot since doing my day and night routine with the vitamin c. I still have a lot of old acne scars so I&#x27;m always looking for ways to make them fade. I really like your vitamin c and I will be repurchasing soon and excited to try some of your other products!!! I&#x27;m already halfway done with my current bottle lol!! I also got to say they have GREAT customer service!!! In particular Erica!!! She was so kind and answered all my questions and followed up on my skincare! That&#x27;s truely a company that cares about their customers :@)</li>
    <li> I use this morning and night before moisturizer and have noticed an amazing difference!  My chest is no longer deeply lined.  The backs of my hands are more youthful.  I will be ordering more.  Great customer service!</li>
    <li> I love this serum, and it is already working on me. My skin is softer, smoother and brighter too.The company also give you very good support.</li>
    <li> Used the whole thing and saw no difference.</li>
    <li> I love these products.  I&#x27;m starting to see a change in the fine lines around my eyes! I love that it has NO perfume or smell. So clean feeling and absorbs quickly. These products are now on my &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; list! I have already recommended these to friends! Megan Schnall</li>
    <li> You know how every time you make a purchase you receive an email ensuring you received the product? And another with specific instructions? And then after a few weeks the seller again contacts you to make sure you are absolutely happy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, wait, that almost never happens. Except with TruSkin. Customer service is beyond the moon. You&#x27;ll be spoiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s not the point. Over-40 skin brings with it lovely surprises. I don&#x27;t know what to call it. Spots and, well, things, attach to your skin. They&#x27;re not of the harmful ilk, just annoying. I purchased this serum to attack a &#x27;place&#x27; on my forehead that has been there for years. I&#x27;m not finished with the bottle, yet the bothersome spot has decreased from the size of a pencil eraser to pencil lead tip. I&#x27;m running around town (well, my living room) telling people to touch my face and feel how soft I am! No more rough thingy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deets: Gently apply a few drops of serum (according to directions, read &#x27;em!) morning and night. Experience the lovely tightening effect. Apply some moisturizer and forget anything is on your face. Eagerly await the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum works. I bought it because it sounded good. I&#x27;ll keep buying it because it is now one of the only products I need. Trust.</li>
    <li> This is the best Vitamin C serum I have used!  It dries nice and smooth on the skin and I could immediately see a difference.  I have used other products that were much more expensive and didn&#x27;t work.  I have only been using this product for about a month and have seen such an improvement in my skin such as age spots disappearing and a firmness and glow to my skin.  I will continue to order this product as part of my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Really noticed a difference in the texture of my skin. Will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Made my skin very tight.  I thought it would sink in and moisturize, but after using a few nights I decided to pitch it because I actually felt it was making my skin dried out and increasing the wrinkles around my eyes.  I was putting on moisturizer after it completely dried, but still didn&#x27;t feel it was doing anything good to my skin.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the serum.  I use it both day and night.  Sense I started using the serum I’ve noticed my makeup goes on smoother, the clarity of my skin is improving and my age spots are slowing fading.</li>
    <li> I received the serum quickly, it was packed well wrapped in bubble wrap.  The serum is in a brown glass bottle with a screw on cap with dropper, which is great to prevent contamination.  After washing and drying my face at night, i put an entire dropperful in my hand and smooth it all over my face, around the eyes, neck, chest and whatever is left i smooth onto the back of my hands and forearms.  I am in my 30s and consider the use of a vitamin c serum an investment in the future appearance of my skin.  The product is quite liquidy, which allows it to spread well, it is colorless, and odorless, and it absorbs well and quickly into the skin.  No stinging, burning, or itching. Customer service sends an email after puchase with more detailed instructions for use with other topicals and medications.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing..I would recommend  it to everyone. I have sensitive  skin and I have had no problems with irritation. This product has already started to diminish my wrinkles within two weeks!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I am very fair skinned and have a lot of sun damage on my face. TruSkin has reversed some of the damage. My skin is healthier and more vibrant. Friends have told me &amp;#34;You look really good lately, are you wearing make-up?&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with a product.</li>
    <li> Very good product..Highly recommended</li>
    <li> works really great. I use it once a day until my issue is resolved.</li>
    <li> This product sounded wonderful, BAD results.  It was purchased in the summer months, arrived on a 100 degree day, and sat in a broiling mailbox for several hours until painfully hot to the touch.  After use skin appeared red, felt slightly raw, pores appeared larger.  Discontinued use after 1 week.  Later read that vitamin C oxidizes over 70 degrees Farenheit, and that oxidized vitamin C can be a skin irritant.  Don&#x27;t know whether this was the issue or not, but nevertheless cannot give positive review.  UPDATE:  I was contacted by the company shortly after I posted this review, and they offered me a chance to try the product again, when the heat wave in my area had broken.  I agreed and a new bottle arrived fairly promptly.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and I&#x27;ve had none of the bad reactions I had last time. I can&#x27;t really tell yet whether it&#x27;s doing anything special for me... I think my skin tone looks a little evener, but I&#x27;m going to give it a little more time.  So my review goes from one star to four, for the combination of FANTASTIC customer service and a product that&#x27;s definitely much better when it isn&#x27;t exposed to extreme heat.</li>
    <li> LOVE the Vitamin C Serum. It is wonderful and has definitely helped with my uneven complexion from being in the sun too much in my 20&#x27;s. I will definitely buy from them again. Erica reached out to me and has been so great to work with from TrueSkin Naturals. Such a great company with great products that come to your door quickly!!</li>
    <li> After three months&#x27; use, I can say with certainty that this is this product is worth the money.  My skin is brighter, firmer, and more even.  Considering my starting point, this was a much-needed improvement.  I don&#x27;t have much issue with acne, but I have a lot of broken capilaries and rosacea and some fine lines.  While it has not eliminated my issues altogether, it has certainly kept them at bay.  I even feel like I could sometimes go sans-makeup! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the fact that I put on more moisturizer or this product, but I have also noticed a definite decrease in the fine lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m only 30--so they&#x27;re quite fine), but unfortunately have not seen an impact on my deep forehead lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on light and is almost scentless.  At first, I noticed a slight tightness in my skin, but after speaking with Erica at TruSkin Naturals, I found out that it was just a brief adjustment to the high concentration of Vitamin C.  Still, I noticed that the texture, smell, and feel of it was much more pleasant than the Vitamin C powder from Philosophy (which I also enjoyed, but was not as easy to apply, stung, and made my hands smell.  Considering it yielded comparable results, this serum is definitely worth your consideration).  http://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Turbo-Booster-Powder-Ounce/dp/B0012ILUC6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1437534449&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;philosophy+turbo+booster+c&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to take a moment to compliment on the customer service. Erica was able to give customized feedback (including recommending more moisturizer, which worked wonderfully for me and the product).  I&#x27;ve just gotten my new bottle in the mail in perfect time--one bottle lasts me about 4 months.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This product goes on easily without irritation. The price is great, too. I decided to purchase this once I ran out of an expensive Ole Hendrick&#x27;s vitamin C serum that I was using and so far they seem to be very very similar. I&#x27;d definitely repurchase from this brand.</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;This product is great! It improved the overall clarity of my skin making it look smoother and healthier. I have always battled with large pores and by firming and toning my skin, the serum made the pores almost vanish. I have tried other Vitamin C serums for 3 times the price and was not nearly as impressed as I am with this one. Super prompt delivery and excellent customer service!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Skin looks good. But I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference. I am a black woman and I have really good skin without a lot of wrinkles to begin with. I use vitamin C to try to keep it that way as I age.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about 2 weeks and today I got some really amazing compliments. A friend asked if I had resurfacing done... NOPE, I was told that I look 10 years younger, was I drinking more water, did I get injections, was I doing something different?  NOPE! NOPE! AND YES! I pulled out the bottle to show her and she couldn&#x27;t believe the results. I am 43 and from a car accident over 20 years ago I have had a number of facial reconstruction surgeries that caused swelling and ultimately uneven skin tone and fine lines. GONE! GONE! &amp; GONE!!!&lt;br /&gt;I broke out slightly at the end of week one BUT I stuck it out understanding that this serum was renewing my skin and therefore &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; my face of all the junk that&#x27;s been hanging around. It cleared up quickly and now there is no sign of the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I was very secretive about using it until today, I was waiting to see if anyone noticed a change and like I said, YUP!! This woman is quite a bit older than me and has known me for about 10 years so to hear that I look 10 years younger and my skin looks beautiful from her was perfect, she would know!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the serum for 6 days, but it makes my face feel great, and I am optimistic about the results I  will have in the weeks and months to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fact that it is made in the USA and has awesome reviews, makes the total package even more attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for keeping &#x27;MADE in the USA&#x27; still alive.</li>
    <li> I have been using the vitamin C every morning since I received it. Skin feels hydrated and some dark spots seem lighter. Will continue to use. thanks</li>
    <li> The best I can say, after using this for about 2 months, is that I haven&#x27;t seen any new wrinkles.  However, I&#x27;m still holding on to the ones I already had.  No smoothing, no diminishing, no looking 5, 10 or even 2 years younger.</li>
    <li> I must say...the serum is really working.  My skin is smoother and more even toned.  Also, the redness I usually have is very much diminished.  I really love the product!</li>
    <li> looking for some good results in the next few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I originally was looking to replace the product I was using to diminish dark spots on my hands. When I saw this Vit C Serum, I felt it offered me even more...Vit C, E and Hyaluronic Acid. These are good not only for dark spots but fine lines and Collagen which are all good in helping my aging skin. And at about the same price,getting more for the same price was a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Vit C Serum for about two weeks. I use it twice a day on my face, neck and the back of my hands and am very happy with the results. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Serum is awesome! I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I do like it very much and have noticed a difference in my skin. My skin looks and feels better and my makeup goes on much more smoothly. I have only been using it a short while so I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly impressed with the results of this serum.  The consistency is as described and it absorbs quickly. My skin is so much smoother and my pores have shrunk. My skin is much clearer.  I have combination skin so it is usually difficult to find a product that works well for my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is excellent.  The Co founder sent me emails about the product before I received it.  My bottle arrived cracked so some of the serum leaked out. I let her know and she assured my I would get a replacement bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent. I would certainly buy this again!</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old Caucasian with extremely sensitive skin. I can only clean my face with water and Aveeno lotion to remove eye makeup. It&#x27;s so sensitive that I haven&#x27;t changed my foundation makeup since I was in middle school. (I tried and was faced with horrible skin reactions) Unfortunately I have faced many health problems and with these came many medications and then the brown spots on my face. I aged more since I have been sick all in the last 4 years or so. I have used prescribed medical products to remove the spots. The treatment was painful and I had to &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; my facial skin, this was a $500 treatment and when I couldn&#x27;t afford it, the spots came back even darker! I bought this product because the reviews guaranteed it to work well on sensitive skin. I have been using it about 3 weeks. It&#x27;s a small glass bottle with an eye dropper applicator. The liquid is silky but not oily. (Don&#x27;t tip yours over on the counter like I did :&#x27;(  cry) I use it twice a day. I was watching the spots and happened to realize the lines around my eyes were smoother. The area on each sides of my nose and upper checks were firming too! Tighter facial skin after what my age and health has done to me? YES PLEASE! So far I do believe I can see the spots slowly lightening. Either way. The change of firmness and smoothness of my face is amazing in such a short time. Customer service is great in that they send emails, not automated ones, actual emails! They follow up on any questions and are so kind. I will continue to use this and order more when it dwindles. I&#x27;ll update my review and my stubborn spots. This is only the second review I&#x27;ve left on Amazon, although I order a lot. I feel this product is WORTH IT!</li>
    <li> probably the best serum on the market. I have tried so many but this one REALLY works. Would recommend this to anybody!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!! I love that it&#x27;s so absorbable and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. (so many Vit C serums do) My skin looks and feels great! I am very happy with my purchase!!!</li>
    <li> This product deserve more than five stars!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing Product&lt;br /&gt;TruSkin Naturals, is the BEST&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve notice improvement within two days.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the retinol serum on day # 3, because of how well the vitamin C serum is doing.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this product to EVERY ONE!</li>
    <li> Great product from TruSkin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen some major improvements. My skin seems more refreshed and brighter. I am using this with Petunia DermaRoller to increase its effectiveness. I&#x27;m seeing great reasults till now. I had some hiperpigmentation areas around my chin and upper lip from chemical peel. It seems to have completely disappeared just within couple weeks . Highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> I like it but like past Vitamin C products I breakout.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! In just 2 1/2 weeks I see a huge difference in my skin. The pores have gotten noticeably smaller, my skin brighter and my dark spot is fading.&lt;br /&gt;I have used very expensive facial products in the past and none of them compare to this product. My mother actually commented on how great my skin looked so I bought her a bottle. She couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the customer service is great. I received an email to see how the product is working for me and was also given helpful tips.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product&lt;br /&gt;Im able to go out with no make up during the day.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed that this is an almost totally organic product as there are so many products on the market today that are just loaded with chemicals that are not good for your skin. This serum is totally a different story. It doesn&#x27;t take much product and it works terrific. In only a little over a month of using this serum I already see a huge difference. My sister even said to me this week &amp;#34;your skin looks so good&amp;#34;. Thank you for a truly amazing product! Can&#x27;t wait to see what&#x27;s next.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Heather</li>
    <li> None of these Vit C serum really works to remove age spots that they claim.  It does soften the skin but that&#x27;s about it and anyone can do that with a moisturizer lotion which is cheaper.</li>
    <li> My skin feels smoother &amp; hydrated, serendipitously brighter as well! Nothing to dislike. I am using the product 3x a day under moisturizer/ sunscreen</li>
    <li> Love it! I see a great improvement in my skin, it&#x27;s smoother and softer. I also notice that the dark spots are beginning to get lighter in color. I love that it comes with a dropper, makes for less waste. The consistency is great, you only need a small amount, it spreads over a wide area. I love that it&#x27;s odorless. I have sensitive skin and I notice no burning or itching.</li>
    <li> Love this serum!!!  When I finish this bottle I will be reordering another!!  I am going to try the retinol serum next, these are quality products for a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and the price is amazing!!  I am an esthetician and I highly recommend this product.  I have used Skinceuticals for years and this product is just as good at a fraction of the price.  I have been extremely pleased.  Not many products combine Hyaluronic Acid with C and E.  You usually have to buy your Hyaluronic Acid separately but not with this product.  Saves time and money.</li>
    <li> I use a glycolic peel monthly and using this product after the peel makes my skin look amazing!  I also use almost daily around my eyes and have seen significant improvement wrt wrinkles.  I would recommend this prooduct especially for the price!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I am already on bottle four and will order again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I really like the way it makes my skin feel. A friend I haven&#x27;t seen in awhile commented that I looked so relaxed. Customer service has been excellent and very quick with a response.</li>
    <li> An esthetician recommended using a vitamin c serum to combat uneven skin tone and redness.  Rather than pay spa prices for a serum, I found the TruSkin Vitamin C Serum.  I really love it. It definitely combats the redness and has also improved the skin on my neck. I intend to keep using it and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have waited to review this so that i could give a truthful review after the whole bottle was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed a difference. I used morning and night for the entire duration of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was excellent. They have great follow-up. But in my opinion asking me too soon what I&lt;br /&gt;thought of the product. Offering another bottle. But why would i do that?. I once bought a bottle of Vit C&lt;br /&gt;serum ($75) from a spa I visited after a facial. I did notice a big difference from that. So you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews.</li>
    <li> After a recent facial, my beauty concultant suggested using a Vitamin C serum to lighten my freckles. I&#x27;m so glad I selected this product. I use it twice a day and have noticed an improvement in the smoothness of my skin. Plus, my makeup glides on! This is my new &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; beauty product.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin very soft! I used it only twice,  so let&#x27;s see how it works... ***Update: ordered 2d time, happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what you people are doing over there but this is a godsend serum&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using consistently but couple of nights. And I&#x27;m amazed&lt;br /&gt;That it&#x27;s not strong as my skin tend to react to acid or different product.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this :).</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it! It hasn&#x27;t been very long but I can already tell a difference and im super happy with the results. I can see that my hyper pigmentation is becoming less noticeable and my skin overall looks better!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works on my 67 year old skin. It makes it look and feel so much healthier.</li>
    <li> This product truly is amazing!  A+++ quality! I love the way it absorbs so rapidly and smoothly as soon as it is applied!  Instantly smoothed wrinkles and felt wonderful. And - no shiny after effects, unlike some serum products.  I have been experimenting with various natural products for skin care, with mixed results. I am so glad that I tried this product! It far exceeded my expectations, and I will be back to purchase additional TruSkin products.  Very pleased with this product - worth every single penny!</li>
    <li> Oh I love it. I was using a similar brand from sephora that was almost double the price. I can now get the same results and save money which is key! Love the product :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be turning 60 in a few weeks and I&#x27;m so glad I found TruSkin Naturals Vitamin Serum. I think it&#x27;s better than any expensive department store serum I&#x27;ve tried. My face looks &amp; feels younger.  i just use a small amount morning &amp; at night on my face and neck.It dries quickly and then I dab on a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin C serum. I wear it every morning under my make up.  It works and feels great, zero skin irritation or breakouts.  it doesn&#x27;t turn sticky or burn like others I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;d order again for sure.</li>
    <li> I like the serum and have used it every day for about three weeks.  I have tried many things on the market (like Nerium and others) but honestly, did not see much of a change.  I bought the serum after trying a sample of another Vitamin C product which came in capsule form. The packaging was cute and it dosed out the right amount every day, but when I was shopping to buy more, I stumbled upon the TruSkin serum.  I&#x27;m kind of a simple, no nonsense gal and thought, \\&quot;Why should I pay more for the cute little capsules when I could try TruSkin and get the same results?\\&quot;  So far, I am very pleased.  I am 43 years old and my major problem area is fine lines around my eyes.  I have noticed some difference in the appearance of these lines already.  They&#x27;re not gone, but do appear softer and not as prominent as before.  I plan to continue to use the TruSkin Vitamin C serum.  As far as dislikes, I can&#x27;t really find any at this point.</li>
    <li> After using this product for one month, my dark spots on my face are starting to even out.  I have even received compliments!  I am very happy with TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference immediately!</li>
    <li> Great results! I received this shipment sooner than expected and also had excellent customer service.  One of the representatives contacted me via email just to ensure that I was enjoying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum so far has minimized my smile creases around my mouth dramatically. I was having issues with redness in the creases of my eyes and puffiness and I am excited to say that this serum completely resolved that issue.  I have extremely sensitive skin and yet I have not experienced any irritation to this serum at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum seems to be keeping my breakouts away as well!  I have had ZERO breakouts while using this for the last 2 weeks.  I am hoping that the serum will help to fade my uneven tone and sun pigmentation as others have experienced.  I will keep posting my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this day and night and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product works for me. The first 3-4 days I used it, I saw some improvements. Now, my skin looks smoother, and it actually protects my skin from breaking out a lot. I use it in the Morning and at Night. Also TruSkins Naturals have an excellent customer service. If you have questions regarding their product they will respond to you, and not just responding with a uniformed customer service format, they respond to you in detailed explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Co-founder, Erica, thank you again, for being zealous. Keep up the excellent work and as always, all the best.</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second bottle. Have been using  this product for 30 days and can already see the results. I was told just today that my skin was beautiful and glowing. Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> This serum seems to have improved my rosacea flare-ups. My skin looks and feels better after a month of using it once daily. I have recently increased to twice daily applications. It&#x27;s too soon to tell a difference. The best thing about this product is the amazing customer service this company provides. I was sent directions for use and a one-month follow-up email to see how I liked it. That means a lot!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results I have received from using TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C. My skin is softer, and the rough patches on my forehead have disappeared. Before I used TruSkin, I used another brand of Vitamin C serum.I like the thicker consistency of your product, and I think it has worked more effectively on my skin. Thanks for an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I take phytoceramides along with the vitamin C serum and my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I am really loving the Vit-C Serum! I have very sensitive, very light skin (prone to sunburn) + problematic acne and the serum really helps my skin to look and feel more healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m kind of a tomboy and have never really gotten into a &amp;#34;skin care regimen&amp;#34; before but … this is definitely working!</li>
    <li> Vitamin c serum anti-aging product is the best! my facial appearance as really,really improved leaving my skin feeling fresh,smooth,and soft,TrueSkin gets an A&amp;#34;+ from me.</li>
    <li> Different packaging but very nice serum!!</li>
    <li> You folks are doing a FABULOUS job - and I&#x27;m so grateful to you! I&#x27;ve been trying different skin products for 40 years and nothing else comes even close! My skin is aging and sensitive with some rosacea and a few dark spots from sun damage as well as scars from pre-cancerous spot removal. It has been looking saggy, dry, tired and splotchy for several years. After using this product at night for a couple of weeks now I am so proud of my smooth, soft, and almost even face and neck. The fine lines have plumped out to make my skin look much more firm, and it actually glows around the jawline (I&#x27;ve always wondered what &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; meant)! I don&#x27;t even want to spoil the look with foundation, just apply my Aveeno moisturizer with sunscreen and a couple dots of concealer and spend the day with my new natural looking beautiful skin! I&#x27;m holding my breath to see how long it lasts! Thank you again for your wonderful serum.</li>
    <li> Great for your skin!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent costumer service and amazing products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month, and I love the results! My skin is brighter, more even, and smooth.</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. I use it twice a day and have seen remarkable improvement in my skin. I would strongly recommend this and will most likely repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the way it softened my fine lines and how smooth my skin looks and feels. Although I did purchase this product for my dark spots and sun damage. Still haven&#x27;t seen and fading as of yet, but it has only been a few weeks since I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have not used this everyday because of rosacea but it has not made the redness worse. The formula goes a long way and is not sticky or greasy. I do like how my skin feels after using as for any reduction in wrinkles, not sure yet need more time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the vitamin c serum!! I let it  dry before I put on my moisturizer at night and in the mornings. I see the difference as I have been using it for a month already. This is my second bottle I&#x27;ve bought. I had a a lot of sun damage as a kid growing up outdoors mostly and loved to sun worship. Now I&#x27;m paying the price but I&#x27;ve seen such a turnaround with this product. Also I use only basic natural products on my skin-pure oils such as coconut, Shea, olive and almond and even on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I even went back and purchased two more bottles.  It really helps with the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical of beauty product claims, but I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by the condition of my skin after using this product for the last three weeks. My skin seems to be more hydrated, and the lines around my eyes have softened a bit.  Will keep using.</li>
    <li> I really love your product you are doing an excellent job, my skin looks better, soft and younger.&lt;br /&gt;this product is so good.</li>
    <li> I have an oily skin meaning I have breakouts in summer. This product is worth it&#x27;s price. My skin if firm and smooth and the dark circles around my eyes and the fine lines are less visible. I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup and this serum makes my skin shine free and is really cooling and gentle on my skin. I will recommend this product for anyone. I&#x27;m 31 and really happy with how my skin looks and feels.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot, seems to work very well!!!  I would recommend this product. Also customer service is the best</li>
    <li> Not seeing any results and the stupid labels for a return did not print out and now the return site for this product doesn&#x27;t allow me to reprint!  Again, I&#x27;m upset!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.Excellent product very smooth on the skin, very easy to apply. I have been using it for a week and I believe I already see a difference on my face.</li>
    <li> i have bought two bottles, seems my skin is getting worse and dry. It&#x27;s not worth I pay for.</li>
    <li> This product has been a great surprise. I have sensitive skin and this product has not once irritated my skin and I use this everyday. I have been using this for a couple of months now.  I am very pleased with the results. My skin appears much smoother and clearer, and best of all I have noticed my redness has greatly improved as well. This product is not oily at all and absorbs instantly into the skin. I just purchased again.</li>
    <li> i dont know why this one not working on my face maybe i am applying wrong ...</li>
    <li> So refreshing and soothing</li>
    <li> Did not work. Used it everyday as directed and I still have sun spots on my face. The company is very nice. They sent me another bottle and instructions and It might have worked a little but I still have very visible sun spots on both sides of my face which I would really like to get rid of.</li>
    <li> Still testing the product for age spots</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. I am 54 with very dry skin. In the high altitude of Colorado skin does not thrive due to lack of moisture. I felt I was aging bad. The serum is turning things around. I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on a beauty routine but your product is simple and easy to use. With minimal time involved (wash, serum, moisturize) it feels like I have given myself a mini facelift. Thanks</li>
    <li> Absolutely a skin saver! After years of torture and terrible acne scarring i finally decided to spend 3000 on expensive laser treatments this year...i ended up with another scar from the procedure because i accidently scratched myself overall waste of money ...a month ago i got a derma roller and this serum and in jusr a month it has almost healed the damage done by procedure plus evened out my overall complexion. .even my friends see a dif..cant imagine the results ill get in another few months..love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am a satisfied customer and I love your product! The vitamin C serum is just as it was advertised, wonderful for my skin. It makes my skin feel so smooth and my skin looks terrific. There is not one thing I dislike about it. You only have to use a very small amount and it covers your skin easily. The fine wrinkles in my skin has diminished. I am totally sold on your product!  I would suggest to anyone over 45 to use this product on a daily basis to improve the overall quality of their skin - it is amazing!</li>
    <li> I really like natural and organic and I love face serums so I was so excited to try this. Def soaks in the skin very nicely without leaving your face oily or greasy. No sticky feeling either which is a plus. I find no smell to this product. Nice, natural anti aging serum with many benefits for keeping a smooth glowing young looking face :) I love that it comes in glass too, always a plus.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I feel a nice tightness and more vibrant looking.  Super happy :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again for providing such a great product and amazing customer service!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I don&#x27;t do makeup, this keeps my skin bright and happy.....will order, hmmm, probably 1,000 more....in my lifetime. Very pleased. I have naturally olive skin and it brings out my &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. HAPPY!</li>
    <li> I really loved this product. I was able to try it out and I can see fantastic results after using it for a couple weeks. My face looks so much brighter and I have been getting many compliments.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS Serum!!! I feel and look 10 years younger!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like it&#x27;s an act of love to do something like this for myself. I&#x27;m always doing for others and putting myself last but I&#x27;ve decided it is my turn to nurture myself. So using this product, I feel I&#x27;m nurturing &amp; showing myself that I am worth taking care of. I know that sounds stupid, but if you don&#x27;t love and care for yourself, who else will.&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product/serum, I feel beautiful, I feel loved, I feel like the goddess in me shines and I&#x27;m a kinder person.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s just the way I feel using this serum.....</li>
    <li> its ok, haven&#x27;t see any changes yet</li>
    <li> This serum doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. It goes on and feels smooth. I have already been getting compliments on having vibrant looking skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!! I LITERALLY SAW AND FELT A DIFFERENCE IN A WEEK WITH THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The seller is very conscientious and e-mailed a thank you for purchase, a delivery date and instructions for best way to use. I bought the sister product, hyaluronic acid, to use with this and in just 4 or 5 days I could see a new brightness and smaller pores in my skin. I use both products twice daily...will keep using for sure!</li>
    <li> Awesome serum, lines reduced, skin tight and smooth. It even help reduced acne buildup on my face. Used it three times a day.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! My skin looks better after only using a few weeks and it&#x27;s very light. The customer service is like no other! They followed up with me to see how if I liked the product or not. Will definitely buy from them again!</li>
    <li> It is awesome stuff. Really works.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave ratings, but this product has blown me away. I&#x27;ve been using organic skin products for a long time and the ratings made me choose this one. My case was a little bit different since I went from having perfect skin to having terrible acne, dark spots and very rough skin patches that wouldn&#x27;t go away with my regular skin routine products. It was the product of the months I spent in a very austere environment because of my work. As soon as I was back home I started researching and found this product. I started to use it right after the microdermabrasion, as well as every evening and morning, and would apply a thicker moisturizer after. Yesterday I stared at my reflection in the mirror again and noticed the dark spots have gotten a lot lighter and the acne has diminished as well. I have to say I&#x27;m impressed, and happy because at this pace I&#x27;ll have my skin back in no time. I&#x27;ll deffinetely include this on my normal beauty routine from now on. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product and Company.As I will soon reach 50yrs and my skin is telling me, to my regret. I have tired a blue million things to help my dark circles and the wrinkles that are starting to show. My Dermatologist told me to use vitamin C things(he had some to sell but i ain&#x27;t paying those prices)so to Amazon I go . TruSkin appeared in list of items.After reading reviews, I thought well price is good. Will try it and see.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did!!! It does work! After a week I see much lighter circles under eyes and the wrinkles are fading nicely to.It&#x27;s also helping with dark spots on my hands!&lt;br /&gt;As a company they do a great job! was sent email giving more Product info and instructions on use alone or with other skin meds.&lt;br /&gt;I sent them email inquiring if they had a moisturizing lotion to use with this. I got reply the NEXT DAY!! Gave me more info and was very helpful...you just dont see that anymore .Its great!&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting more of this and sending to everyone i know.Personally i don&#x27;t think you can go wrong getting this.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you TruSkin for a wonderful product and Amazon for having it!</li>
    <li> I really like what this has done for my skin.  I have seen dark spots fading and a nice glow.</li>
    <li> This serum does brighten your skin and make it soft.  As for the other claims, doesn&#x27;t happen for me. After 2 1/2 bottles no noticeable difference in brown spots or wrinkles.  When you first put it on it softens wrinkles as any moisturizer does.  But after hours the effect is gone.  I tried another brand before I purchased this TruSkin and did notice a change in brown spots etc. and I am going back to the brand in the blue bottle.  I thought perhaps this brand might be just as good and was a good buy at buy 2 get 1 free.  Not a very good buy if it does not work.</li>
    <li> I have used other Vitamin C serums before but this product beats all others in quality and the cost is so reasonable. I love it and will continue to use it. It is the BEST!</li>
    <li> This is the best vitamin c serum I have ever used. It is not at all greasy. I have bought very expensive ones from department stores and I discovered I was paying for the brand name, not the quality of the product. This serum makes my skin feel very good and smooth and when I put my moisturizer on after using the serum, my face looks very toned.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see any special difference on my neck and face, but after talking with company&#x27;s adviser I started to use it with AHA cream and the result was great!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is softer than before and also the line on my neck is not annoying as it used to be.</li>
    <li> I am a 47 year old man and can say that this product is also good for fine lines and wrinkles on men as well.  The customer service is second to none, they are very nice and answer all questions and take that extra time to make you feel more than just a number in making a sale, they believe in their product and really want to help people.  This is by far one of the better experiences of a business and the product speaks for itself, it DOES work.....you do have to use it routinely but I started to see results at the 2 week point, then much more at a month and more after two months, I am going to order my 3rd bottle shortly! Just try it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  My skin is more even toned and smoother than ever!  I ran into an old friend the other day who couldn&#x27;t believe my children were all grown up because he said I looked exactly the same as when they were small.  Nice!</li>
    <li> The bottle was half empty.....did not have much left to try</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best serum I&#x27;ve ever tried. I have oily skin with some sun damage and acne marks. Serum is helping me smoothing my scars, making my skin looking glowing, healthy and young. I&#x27;m already on my second bottle and gonna continue using it. I like the way it feels after applying. It&#x27;s definitely one of the best solution on the market. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am on my fourth bottle of TruSkin Naturals Best Vitamin C Serum. Just to be honest after my first bottle, Erica who is the co-founder of TruSkin Naturals contacted me and after emailing with her she sent me my second bottle for free. Now onto the review of the product itself. I really bought this because I am very fair and have some dark spots on my face. I have been using this product twice a day, morning and night. While this product does help, it is not a miracle worker for me in this aspect. That being said this product is exceptional for me is in the actual feel and look of my skin. My skin is smoother than it has ever been in my whole life! Also this works well with my moisturizer and weirdly helps with my oily skin.  I will continue to repurchase based on these things alone. And if anyone knows a great product for dark spots or the over production of melanin I would love to know so i can try it.</li>
    <li> Wow - what a great, great find!  I tend to try new products with a fair degree of objectivity and pay very close attention to product claims and results after a decent trial period.  If it doesn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t hesitate to quit using it in order to eliminate time wasted and go on to something else.  This product will remain in my everyday skin care routine because it has honestly made a difference.  I use it every morning (goes on super smooth and works beautifully under makeup) and again at night.  I even wear it alone and use a light touch of face powder and or bronzer on casual days and feel just great going out and about.  Furthermore, the customer service has been remarkable.  I love it and the company!</li>
    <li> I ordered the product 2 days ago and already received it. The company has a great customer service, they sent me an e-mail notifying that I should be getting it soon. I just used it and it feels soft, a little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t really have a smell. I just started several products at the same time so not sure which ones are working. I will give updates soon about this item.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin c serum! it&#x27;s a miracle serum!  I have been battling with a really dull and bad complexion that gets clogged every other day leaving me with lots of marks due to extraction. All these problems have been eradicated within less than a month of usage :)&lt;br /&gt;It does not sting (and I have an extremely sensitive face prone to having eczema) it does not provoke my skin nor does it give me eczema, (which some products do), it brightens my skin and now my face is younger looking with radiance. I no longer have to use foundation on my face (only my under eye) the best part is, the serum is not drying at all. Some days, I even skip the step of applying my argan oil. In the past, if I do not moisturize my skin, the next day I will end up with flakes and itchiness. I really am so grateful for this awesome serum.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a great product! You have earned a loyal customer :D</li>
    <li> After using TruSkin for about two weeks my brown spots have lightened and my skin feels smoother.  I am so happy to finally find something that actually works and cannot wait to see more results as I keep using it. I have been using it twice a day.  Also, customer service has been great.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised &amp; in stated condition</li>
    <li> I must say it works wonderfully it has almost completely vanished a dark spot I could not get rid of. And Erica co owner to tru skin has been wonderful emailing and her attention has been awesome. I recommend this to everyone having issues with there skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the TrueSkin Vitamin C Serum for about 3 weeks and I see so many positive changes in my skin, especially a glow. I love this product! The companies customer service is also absolutely amazing and helpful. The representative emails me frequently, giving me advice and some amazing facts about the serum. I highly recommend getting the Vitamin C Serum!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely loving my serum!! It has helped so many different issues - my skin is not as oily, much more balanced. It also has stayed free from blemishes and my pores appear smaller, the tone is beginning to improve too, I think that will keep getting better with time. I was so happy to see a coupon for my next order as I will be restocking soon. I also love that you&#x27;re leaping bunny certified!!! I am the proud momma of a rescued beagle, and while she didn&#x27;t come from a laboratory, I realize how many beagles and other innocent animals are tested on needlessly.</li>
    <li> I have melasma and this is the first product I have used that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and is significantly fading my dark patches.  I have been using it for about two months and I am noticing a big improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I like Dr Oz&#x27;s better.</li>
    <li> I recently started using this product.  I&#x27;m very happy with it!  It does not irritate my skin at all.  I feel it&#x27;s a great value, compared to comparable products.</li>
    <li> At age 68, I have become cynical about products that claim to give younger looking skin in only a few weeks.  I&#x27;ve tried so many of the highly-publicized products over the years-and wasted so much money. On my \\&quot;Disappointing and Waste of Money List\\&quot; are over-the- counter lotions at drug stores,  high end products in the department stores....even Dr. Oz Recommended creams, and finally , an incredibly expensive, multi-step system, available by prescription only, from a plastic surgeon.    None of these products worked as well--or were as pleasant on my skin or easy to use-- as Tru-Skin Naturals.  After only a few weeks, I see my pores are smaller and my face has a tighter, more luminous look to it.  Do I look 20?  Nope, but I didn&#x27;t expect that, despite what airbrushed older actresses and teenage models in the magazines ads are paid to claim.    What I do see is skin that makes me look healthy and fit, able to go with a minimum of make up--and still get told I look younger than I really am.    Another plus is the staff at TruSkin who take a personal interest in you and in your results.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> it  works  very  well  on  my  face.</li>
    <li> Just started using this wonderful product. I have a stubborn case of melasma, and it will take time to heal, but my skin is firmer and smoother! I use it twice a day!  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I needed something to help with hyperpigmentation on and around areas where I shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for about a month now and it is really fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;It has begun to take my complexion back to its pre-shaving era.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and I&#x27;ll continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It has the simplest pure ingredients and my skin immediately felt the effects...&lt;br /&gt;I can see a difference even in a few weeks. I&#x27;m almost 53 and have always taken good care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added this to my regime and plan on keeping it. I&#x27;m also getting some for my 19 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;Truly a find.</li>
    <li> Non stinging, even after shaving.  I have been using for about a month and I am already seeing the clarity of my skin improve.  Iwill definately be reordering and making this a permanent item in my antiaging regimen.</li>
    <li> I am using it and I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I usually have trouble with blackheads and have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of them plus my skin feels so soft after I apply this serum. Excellent seller</li>
    <li> I thought this product helped my face look clearer. Noticed a difference after using it about 2-3 weeks. My darker spots on my face are a little lighter.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my skin look and feel!</li>
    <li> Great product, great customer service! Recently ordered this and love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS -- love this serum.  No irritation or breaking out on my sensitive skin.  A small bit covers a nice area around eyes, mouth and throat.  Seems to provide nice softening and moisturizing.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Like that it is organic and dries quickly. Still early in usage to see if it is effective on my dark spots. It certainly isn&#x27;t harmful. very involved company founder. :)</li>
    <li> It is on time and carefully packed.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good anti agining product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love!! My skin feels and looks so much better...everytime I use it I can see a difference. Love love love</li>
    <li> Although I have only used the TruSkin product for 3 weeks applying it on twice a day, I can definitely see a difference in my skin.  I’ve always had oily skin with mild scars from acne and the TruSkin product seems to have my skin feeling smooth and looking vibrant!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference...</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It has healing properties for the skin and speeds up the healing process overnight for me. I use it all the time. Great Product</li>
    <li> Have used this for about 2 weeks and have not noticed anything different with my skin. May need more time.</li>
    <li> Like product very much.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> I am loving my serum and look forward to exploring all of the items in your line. Thank you for all of your help. I told my BFF about your line as well.</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I&#x27;m already noticing less wrinkles after only a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a 45 year old ex smoker with a few hated lip lines that seem to be “easing” a bit.  I like that.  I have very sensitive skin that doesn’t take very many creams or anything of the like but this seems to work for me.  Customer service is beyond expectations!!</li>
    <li> I really like the serum. I am very pleased with the way my skin feels, and the fact that it did not break my skin out, as it is very sensitive. Also, and this was very important in my decision to purchase, the serum is cruelty free/not tested on animals (and I can assure you I would NOT have purchased if it had not been…everything I use on my face and my hair is cruelty free).&lt;br /&gt;I really like it and I will be reordering soon!</li>
    <li> I was just at my wits end with my dark circles. Being African American with hyperpigmentation and dark circles I just couldn&#x27;t deal with it anymore. I decided to go on the hunt for something natural and this what I found.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face the night I got it and then put it on. When I woke up the next day I saw that my dark circles were visibly lighter and the dark marks already looked like they were fading away. I give this product a two thumbs up. They are a great company and it truly works!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re AWESOME! Will definitely buy from them again. Great customer service. Great, all natural product.👍</li>
    <li> I really like the serum. My skin feels and looks more fresh and renewed. I can see a difference in my skin tone when I wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for 4 weeks in the mornings before moisturizer and I love it.  It feels soothing during application and has a pleasant, mild scent.  My facial skin now looks much more bright, smooth, and translucent.  For a long time, my facial regime was simply to cleanse and moisturize.  Around the same time I started using your serum, I also began to use a facial scrub, toner, and nighttime retinol.  I am certain that the combination of those has contributed to the overall improvement in my skin.  I do feel that the Truskin Naturals has had a significant contribution.  I don&#x27;t feel complete unless I put some on in the morning!</li>
    <li> This dries quickly and you are supposed to wait 15-20 minutes and then apply moisturizer.  I wanted more of a smoothing serum, whereas this just seems to dry up in a thin layer and is not that thick like the ones that make your make-up look smoother and more flawless.</li>
    <li> My skin looks absolutely fabulous. I only use it in the morning and I am seeing amazing results. I will never be without my serum. Thank you for the incredible product.</li>
    <li> Sadly the product didn&#x27;t work for me. I was expecting good results, but I got nothing. ;(</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It goes on well and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve noticed a subtle brightening in my skin which is great considering I&#x27;ve been using the product such a short time.  I&#x27;ve used other vitamin C infused  products in the past and they always irritated my skin but I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity to this product.  Good job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and may try your other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for providing such a good product at such a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I was expecting some sort of result that I could see, but after several weeks of using the product, I see absolutely no difference.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not sure how effective this is, but it&#x27;s easier to apply and stay on your face compare with another similar serum I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen any improvements yet</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel soft</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product, my skin texture is smoother, lines are less noticeable. My friends have mentioned that my skin glows.</li>
    <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t think that trueskin would work, because nothing does. I hate when I&#x27;m wrong.  this product is AMAZING. My skin is in shock (which is good ) lol and my hands, which I was sure were just doomed now,looks like I am 18 again. I just Can&#x27;t believe how amazing this stuff is. The only bad thing about trueskin, is that it runs out.  </li>
    <li> After reading a good amount of the reviews I decided to give this serum a try.  When I received it I immediately began using it  that night.  I only applied at night for the first week, but could clearly feel the difference within the first couple of days.  Now I apply once in the morning and once at night.  I really like the way my face feels immediately after applying it and have gotten complimented on various occasions.  I am now looking into buying the other complimenting serums now.  For the price it is a really good deal and product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And their customer service is great!</li>
    <li> I think this is actually helping my skin look a little smoother.  It is not irritating.  I will keep ordering.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with TruSkin Vitamin C. It has improved my texture and tone on my face and leaves it feeling very refreshed.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and so far I love this product. Makes my skin feel so soft and healthy. Glowing!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Vit C serum I love it!!!  It works great have been using it every day!!! Was buying it at Whole Foods paying much more and was having a stock problem. Love getting it here and is much more affordable I also order the Hyaluronic Acid serum both product&#x27;s were recommended by my dermatologist!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results I&#x27;ve seen since using TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;I am now using my second bottle and find my skin smoother and softer with fine lines around my eyes all but gone. Although the wrinkling from sun damage is still visible on my décolletage, it is less defined.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! I dot it onto an area and spreading is very easy to do.</li>
    <li> Huge fan this stuff actually works! I would recommend to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a serum that will make them look great!</li>
    <li> This is the most incredible serum I have ever encountered. In under 2 weeks, my skin is brighter and tighter. I have a more youthful look and glow about my face. I cannot believe how quickly this product worked. I also am so happy that it is not tested on animals, has natural ingredients, and is made in America. It almost seems too good to be true. I only use this at night but I will continue to use this for many years to come. I love this serum! It also did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It has really made my skin look brighter and smooth. Non sticky and also absorbs quicky on my skin. Highly recommended for dull, uneven skintone.</li>
    <li> I really liked the Vitamin C Serum for Face with Hyaluronic Acid ....it feels great and does not dry my skin like others.&lt;br /&gt;I wll order this again and would recommend it to others for sure!&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it smooth the lines........and brightens my skin.</li>
    <li> I have just put both feet into my 40s and have been concerned with making sure I take good care of my skin and hair (yes I know, that should have started in my 20s but I was focused on other things then). Most people comment that they thought I was in my 30s or even 20s when I reveal my age, so apparently I look younger than I am. I don&#x27;t mind investing reasonable money into my anti-aging efforts, and I research EVERYTHING before I buy. I was impressed with the reviews on this serum, so decided to give it a go. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now. I don&#x27;t see super noticeable results, but maybe I need to be older or have more noticeable lines to begin with...one great thing is I have very sensitive skin and break out very very easily. I have not had any major breakouts since starting this product, so that is a huge deal for me. I put this serum on faithfully every morning and night. As soon as I wash my face in the morning, I smooth a few drops onto my skin and pat it. Once it&#x27;s absorbed, I smooth a very very small amount of organic high quality coconut oil onto my dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using and evaluating it, so if my opinion on this serum changes I&#x27;ll update my post. For now, this is a pretty good product and I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I am 44 and taking good care of my skin it&#x27;s one of my priorities! This is my first and so far the ONLY vitamin C, E, Hyaluronic Acid Serum I will ever use! I have been using it for just two weeks and my skin feels smother and some of my old acne scars seems lighter, you might questions yourself; &amp;#34; in just 2 weeks?! &amp;#34; YES , in so little time I can see improvement on my skin and I am looking forward to keep using this product and seen the amazing results I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s capable of. Another thing, customer service is great! Erica is very professional  and attentive. If you have done a little research in skin care, you know that this is the best combination out there and results are seen almost immediately. I&#x27;m looking forward to keep using it. I will update later on.</li>
    <li> I have never used vitamin C on my skin, maybe taking a vitamin C pill but not putting it on my face.  I bought this product to initially take care of they hyper pigmentation I have on my face, in two spots that are very dark and bother me a lot.  I can barely cover with makeup and it is does not do wonders for my self confidence at all.  I have used this product for almost a month, not quite yet and the results have been amazing!!!  To explain my skin even further, it&#x27;s blotchy, I have TZone problems with my cheeks being very dry.  I have had started developing wrinkles under my eyes....YIKES and trying to make my skin feel soft without making my face look like an oil slick has been very difficult, especially after putting on all the creams for wrinkles...like under the eyes, the day cream, the night cream.  You name it, I&#x27;ve got it and put it on my face to keep the signs of my tanning fetish years back and my growing age...40 something..from making me look and feel like I&#x27;m old before my time.  The results I said have been amazing and they have!  My blotchiness is GONE!!! I can wear make up now a couple days a week (around the house..HA!) without scaring everyone!! LOL!  No kidding thought, my skin is EVEN TONED now!! I didn&#x27;t expect that!  My dark circles, the wrinkles under my eyes.....gone!  My skin has tightened and even the dark spots on my skin have lightened, which I can now cover with makeup!!! WOOHOOO!!!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what the serum does for me months down the road, especially since I&#x27;ve experienced such a huge breakthrough in my skin just in the short amount of time that I&#x27;ve used it!  The ONLY bad thing and I mean the ONLY THING is the smell.  But it&#x27;s organic and I can understand that...some of the most natural things out there can smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell really bad, it just has a little funk smell to it.  Also, it you put on moisturizer on, like I do, then it cancels out the smell, so you can&#x27;t smell it anymore!!  If you have uneven skintone, or blotchiness, or wrinkles that you want to get rid of, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS SERUM!!!  IT IS AWESOME!!! I can honestly say that I have never been happier with a product that I&#x27;ve used on my face than this one.  It IS that good!!  Try it for yourself and give yourself a month to see what amazing things that this serum will do for you!!!  &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;Update: June 2, 2015 I&#x27;ve have been using this faithfully since March of this year and I&#x27;m am completely impressed by this product and how different (for the better) my skin looks.  The lines have noticeably disappeared around my eyes which totally shocked me!  The lines are my forehead are not as deep as they were before and my laugh lines are gone.  My face used to be covered with freckles.  I am not against freckles...ok?!  They are part of my DNA, which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but when you overdo the sun and the freckles become more evident that you&#x27;ve had too much sun.  Freckles w/sunspots don&#x27;t mix..at least on me.  Before, my face was visibly a different color than my neck and the rest of my body, from the overexposure. Not anymore!!!  I am happy to say, I&#x27;ve went from medium, to light and now to fair!!  I used makeup that helps keep my skin protected and my face,neck and neckline are all the same color!  I love this product!  I still have 2 large sunspots that are fading and I will continue to use this product...Love it!  If you have any problems like I have had with my skin, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> using on face nice stuff</li>
    <li> I love using Vitamin C, and truly believe it helps decrease wrinkles and the size of pores. I have been using it for years, and will continue to use it for the rest of my life. I am in my late 60&#x27;s, and most people tell me I look around 50 years of age. I would highly recommend using Vitamin C in your nightly regimen along with tretinoin cream. It really does work!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s really wonderful and I feel my skin is looking younger and refreshed. Light enough to be used as a first step under any other products as well! (ie moisturizer, sunscreen, other serums, make up) I&#x27;m hooked on this.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product! I love it! My skin is smoother and has a nice healthy glow since I have been using this serum.  Funny thing too, I noticed I had a small area on my face that was breaking out (my God, I am 45 wasn&#x27;t that suppose to stop years ago!) and&lt;br /&gt;I applied the serum over the area morning and night...cleared it right up! I have my teenage daughter using it too for this reason. Oh, I will be a repeat customer as I can&#x27;t see how I&lt;br /&gt;can go without. I also like how light the serum is too, absorbs right away. Great for sensitive skin too.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have brought this product twice and like it alot.Will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have olive skin tone and it really helped even it out. I apply it before bedtime and in the AM after washing my face. The acne dark spots that I get clear up fast with this product. That being said I will not be buying this product again since the price sky rocketed to $24+ in less than a month. The seller has to be realistic. There is just too much competition out there. I rather try this from another company that can stay consistent with their prices. I recommend others try other companies first. What&#x27;s to stop them from increasing their prices again? I don&#x27;t trust this company.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Tru Skin Vitamin C Serum and the Tru Skin Hyaluronic Acid together for about 2 weeks.  The dark spots on my face are getting lighter and the wrinkles are less noticeable.  I really love these two products and I can&#x27;t wait to see what results I will see in 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Both these products have become part of my beauty routine.  Thank you for two great products.</li>
    <li> Ok, not sure it works but I love the price and theory behind it.  I use it on my raccoon eyes/ genetic so it may take some time</li>
    <li> It actually works. I used for 3 weeks, morning and night and o saw significant changes. Definitely I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I have only been using it a few days and my skin looks so much better. I read somewhere that using grapeseed oil first and then applying this serum is good for helping with broken capillaries. I started using both of them on the same day and I have been applying both of them in the morning and again before bed. The capillaries have faded quite a bit already. They are still there but not as noticeable, so I plan to keep using both and I have high hopes for them fading even more the longer I use them. My skin also feels and looks so much smoother and the scar I have on my face looks better too. I will be ordering more today because when I was putting it on my face last night I dropped it in the sink full of water from washing my face :(  I have to also say something about the seller here even though I filled out the seller feedback part. Wow, what great customer service! Erica sent me a welcome email before I had even received the product.She promised to follow up with another email in a couple of days with more information about the product which she did. I emailed her to say how happy I was with the serum and got a very fast reply. It is so refreshing to deal with a small, friendly company that obviously cares about its customers and the products it makes. Oh, and my youngest daughter (19) loves this serum too so they have 2 very happy customers here. Highly recommend the product and the company :)  If anyone is interested here is the link for the grapeseed oil that I am using  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FIUITDM/ref&#x3D;od_aui_detailpages00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> The serum seems to be working wonders! My skin is beautifully clear. I&#x27;m wearing less make up daily because of it and typically apply just once per day at night.&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about the serum. I wouldn&#x27;t say there is anything I dislike about the product, the consistency or the feel. It dries quickly and I only need about 1/3 of a squeeze to the dropper to cover my forehead, cheeks, nose, chin and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very satisfied thus far. I could tell results within 48 hours believe it or not. I was stunned how quickly it worked. My pores are smaller, any blemish I get now is teeny tiny and disappears on its own within one day. There&#x27;s no squeezing, pinning or popping anymore!!! It&#x27;s great. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, their customer service is amazing. They reached out several times to check in and make sure I was 100% satisfied. I thought it was fake / spam mail until the 2nd or 3rd email and Erica said, &amp;#34;If you respond to this email, it will come directly to my inbox!&amp;#34; Then I realized how great the customer service was.</li>
    <li> I love the serum and it works perfectly on my skin!!! For the first time ever, I hear comments such as &amp;#34;what a shiny skin!&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;did you wear foundation under your makeup?&amp;#34; I love it and will continue using it! Thanks and keep up the great work :)</li>
    <li> I like the serum: my skin was not too bad to start with, but now  it feels wonderful smooth and somewhat tighter. It is very dry in my house in winter; my skin was suffering from this dryness. Now I feel much better. I tried some creams before, but &amp;#34;Vitamin C&amp;#34; is the best I ever had. I was hoping to reduce a little bit some fine lines under eyes,  that did not happen yet. Overall,  I am very satisfied. Thank you for a good job!</li>
    <li> I wanted to use the serum for 4 weeks before making an evaluation and time&#x27;s up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say that I am impressed in the overall condition of my skin. Fine wrinkles around my eyes have been reduced and overall tone and feel of my skin is noticeably better. I have a small dark spot on my cheek to the right of my nose. I had been using a concealer and extra makeup to cover it up. It has lightened so much that it&#x27;s just barely noticeable under my daily makeup! Didn&#x27;t expect that :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing another bottle of serum soon. (Although this product does seem to last a long time).</li>
    <li> Ordered 02/21/15- Really like this product. In just a few days I saw a difference in my skin. My skin looked radiant and my pores were significantly smaller. It also reduced my blemishes and my raccoon eyes.  I didn&#x27;t mind the watery consistency of it. I thought it was better as it was still effective, but you didn&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this serum. I am a skeptic, but this serum proved me wrong!!  in two weeks i can see the tightens improving and overall look of my complexion!  i was recently told I looked 10 yrs younger than I am!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum around three weeks and almost immediately noticed a difference in how my skin felt and looked. It is smoother and looks brighter already! I am very pleased with the results this far and will continue to purchase and use this product. I can&#x27;t wait to see better results the longer I use it! I use it morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobbi</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum is great. I&#x27;ve used a number of expensive serums but this one does what it claims. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My skin was looking somewhat tired and dull this winter, so I decided to try something different. I had never used a C serum and now I&#x27;m hooked. My skin feels more smooth, supple, and I&#x27;m noticing my fine lines diminishing, especially the ones on my forehead. Hopefully in the next few weeks I&#x27;ll continue to see small improvements. Meanwhile though, I&#x27;m enjoying waking up every morning to clear, fresh skin. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  I really think I noticed a change within a few days but by now I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m noticing a change.  My skin is less bumpy which I think is probably my word for wrinkly.  I&#x27;m 66 and have a medium to light complexion with a ton of sun damage.  I think the cold winter weather and low humidity was making my T-zone dry and more bumpy but now it&#x27;s smooth and feels great.  I have several sun spots and the biggest, darkest one really seems to be getting a little lighter.  I took a picture of it in November on a recommendation from my dermatologist.  In a few weeks I&#x27;ll take another photo of it to see how it compares to the earlier photo.  I had a large squamous cell carcinoma removed from my nose a year and a half ago so I&#x27;m pretty particular about changes in my facial skin.</li>
    <li> I love it, put it on my face and hands and recently on a burn that I have on my arm! My skin is definately softer!  Thank you for the product!</li>
    <li> NOT GOOD AT ALL...SAW NO RESULTS.</li>
    <li> I like it, it makes my skin feel soft. It also looks like it is making my age spot lighter. And it has done this in a short time period of about a little over a week. I expect it will keep doing a great job. I will continue to use this product. I would recommend this product. It only takes a little for every application.</li>
    <li> So far, I really love this serum.  It&#x27;s a lighter weight formula than others I&#x27;ve used before, so it feels great under makeup.  It gives my skin a nice glow and I feel like my skin looks softer the more I use it.  The company has also been great, so I would likely try other products from them in the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff has been great for my face. It&#x27;s like a mask that your skin absorbs.  It is also  miracle for crusty nasty dry elbows, I tried exfoliating and moisturizers, olive oil, not even a dent. I used this just now ONCE, and they feel great.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my wife by a friend. She thought why not &amp;#34;give it a try&amp;#34;, as she has with other products.  She loves the results and  is often complimented about her skin and they are surprised when she announces she is  69 1/2 years young.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product a few weeks but it seems to be working. Plus, the company followed up with me which I appreciated. I will be ordering the product again soon.</li>
    <li> What an excellent product!! I love how it makes my skin look so healthy as well as the fact that it is not chemically based but created from organic ingredients.  I am 67 years old and was blessed with good skin.  Vitamin C Serum for the face helps me keep it that way.  My husband keeps saying, &amp;#34;You look beautiful.&amp;#34;  All in all a great find!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my new serum.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel my skin much better. I also recommended it to my friends an daughter.</li>
    <li> this product really does work I have seen a big difference on my face, I have an even skin tone that looks radiant! definitely buying more.</li>
    <li> Tru Skin Serum is working wonders. I really love the product my face is nice and smooth, firm, bright and beautiful. I have gotten quite a few compliments on how young and good I look since the use of the serum. I have already recommended the product to others who have complimented me and I will continue to use and enjoy the product with a 10+ rating.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this serum!  My skin is prone to breakouts, and this stuff is incredible.  My skin looks and feels so much better since I have been using it!  I originally bought it to use with micro needling, but I haven&#x27;t had the guts to try the roller yet.  I decided to try the serum alone, and I am so hooked!!!!  I will definitely be ordering more if this stuff.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like the ads say. False advertising is what I think.</li>
    <li> There is nothing I dislike about your product.  It absorbs quickly and is never greasy. I had noticed two slight creases that were showing up regularly that I didn&#x27;t like; one under my eye and another on my upper lip. They seem to have decreased, not completely, but they are definitely a lot less noticeable to me. I don&#x27;t think I have tried any other product that was as effective as yours. So thank you. I hope the improvement continues. I don&#x27;t think it has done anything for the road map on my forehead, but I&#x27;m very pleased nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Your serum is AMAZING. I love it.  Thank you, so much.  I will be re-ordering it.  We live in Nevada where it&#x27;s really dry and your serum is helping a lot.</li>
    <li> It feels nice and my sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it. I am allergic to most skin care products, but not to this one. I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the appearance of my skin. Also the dropper was awkward to use. A drip top would be more convenient.</li>
    <li> Helps with redness and brown spots</li>
    <li> No irratation. Skin is soft, waiting to finish product for full results .</li>
    <li> Not sure it works but didn&#x27;t make my skin noticeably better.</li>
    <li> So far I am really happy with the serum!! My skin feels firmer and looks brighter! I am 53 years old and one of my uncle&#x27;s commented on how youthful I looked and at that time I wasn&#x27;t wearing any make up.  I am very pleased with your product and will be reordering next week!!</li>
    <li> To all women over the age of 50! I am 58 years old and have been using this product for two years. TruSkin C or the Hyaluronic with C&amp;E  are a Must-Have! Both are great for building elastin and smoothing wrinkles! It is not a filler.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF !! My sister turned me on to this.  I like it very much. I am 54 years old.  I have been using it for about 3 months and have noticed smaller pores, less wrinkle lines, firmer skin and diminishing dark spots. I wish I could put it on my entire body.</li>
    <li> seems to smooth out my  skin but of course wrinkles don&#x27;t improve that much</li>
    <li> Best Product Ever! Truly a Serum with no bad odor that really works! After 15 days I see my skin brighter and my sun and acne spots lighter. Also an incredible customer backup from no other than a co-founder, wow! I am really impressed. This is the first time that someone of a company contacts me and that really wants to know how their product is working and their customer satisfaction. I promise to keep using this product and expect to see more brighter results! Thanks for this great product and better customer&#x27;s attention.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  Just ordered a second bottle.  I have worked in the sun, outdoors all of my life and have sun spots and age spots.  Already this serum has faded some of my skin discoloration.  I like that it has very little odor and is quickly absorbed into your skin.  I have tried many other products and so far this is the best I have used.  I feel confident that using Vitamin C Serum on a routine schedule for a couple of months that my sun and age spots will fade away or enough that they won&#x27;t be so noticeable.</li>
    <li> been using couple weeks but havnt seen a huge change.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Makes my skin feel so hydrated and brightens up my complexion. My skin just soaks it all up. I love how it plumps up my skin. I use it both day and night. Can&#x27;t go without this product. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with my sunspots in my nose and around it. To me is very embarrassing. I&#x27;ve tried everything, from peeling to creams and serums, expensive and cheap ones. when this serum showed up at my page after reading i decided to give a try. And I&#x27;m so happy I did! Today was my second day using and i already notice my spots fading, it&#x27;s fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> I didnt see that much difference, it kinda even out my skin tone and smooth out little expression mark between my eyebrows that pretty much it did... I been using it since Nov.18,2014</li>
    <li> Edit: On my 5th bottle. I&#x27;m still in love! I took a 6 month hiatus from using it when I got into Chanel skin care. After a while, I could tell that my skin wasn&#x27;t very moisturized so I started using this vitamin C serum again and in one week it&#x27;s made a HUGE difference in softness and moisture. It blows the Chanel Micro Serum out of the water and I did *not* expect that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!!!!!!! I love it so much, and right away, that I sent a bottle to my Grandmother who has been lamenting about her skin&#x27;s dry condition lately. She called me to say she LOVES it, too. I&#x27;ve used serums in the past and have always found them to improve my skin and help with dryness in the winter. This one is the best though. A noticeable difference the day I started using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the customer service is AWESOME!!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> have only been using it for 2 weeks now but I love how it makes my skin moisturized and glowing. It is the perfect weight. Not sure if it would be enough on its own during our dry winter season but working great for spring here in Ohio. Since I am 59 I realize there is no magic cure for wrinkles but this product does seem to diminish them which makes me a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;I admire this kind of customer service and that combined with a lovely product(that works) at a good price will definitely have me coming back.&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying the retinol serum next!</li>
    <li> Have seen a change in my skin - just in time for summertime!</li>
    <li> Have not used this enough to really rate it. It does absorb quickly, non greasy and no irritation. I have sensitive skin too.</li>
    <li> I love the TruSkin serum! The biggest plus that I have noticed is that it has made my pores smaller. I am always nervous to put new products on my face for fear of breakouts but that hasn&#x27;t happened with this product! Can&#x27;t really think of anything I dislike about it! :)</li>
    <li> Happy with the product and seeing results after one bottle; second bottle ordered. I can spend multiple hours in direct sun light when training; therefore, over the years I have developed sun spots around the cheek bone area. It gives an uneven appearance on my face and noticeable. I had read about other products, like facial creams; however, I am not interested in applying a mask at night. Using this product in just 1 1/2 months have produced a noticeable clarity to my skin. I apply twice daily first thing in the morning and before bed.</li>
    <li> I ordered a 2nd bottle since I know that it usually takes a couple months to see results. My sun spots have faded slightly, but I will not order again if there is not a bigger difference in the sun spots after this 2nd bottle is used up. Plus, at 25.00 a bottle and it only lasted me a month since I apply it to face, neck and upper chest area, it would end up being too expensive to buy monthly. I plan on getting a chemical peel at my dermatologist this fall and that is only 150.00 for a medium chemical peel, so I would not spend 300.00 per year on this product.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use this twice a day. Great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  This product makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. And probably minus a few wrinkles too!!!</li>
    <li> I am starting to see results after using the serum twice daily.  I had some pretty deep wrinkles on my forehead and they are smoothing out.  Yay!  Turning 40 is an uphill battle.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and great price. My skin is smoother and discolorations are lighter after one month.  Love that it is organic.  Awesome personalized customer service.</li>
    <li> My skin looks great!!!</li>
    <li> I love it!  I will be purchasing another bottle of this serum today,  My skin is a little lighter and brighter and getting better every day.  I have used other serums before this one but never noticed such a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> I started using the serum about 6 weeks ago. I wanted to try a serum because as I age my skin has gotten dry yet it is looser than it used to be. I put SPF on first, the serum and then moisturizer. It took about a month and then people started commenting on how good my skin looked. One person that I hadn&#x27;t seen for awhile asked if I had a facelift. This is the only change to my routine. Pretty phenomenal results! I&#x27;m pushing 60 and this has me looking younger.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products that I have used on my face!! It helps with dark spots and scars and leaves your skin feeling/looking smoother!! Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m not one to post, but:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every morning since I bought it. I love how soft it makes my face feel, and my skin texture is smoothing out. Not helping much for the dark spots which was the main purpose of buying it, but like I said, it definitely hydrates your skin making it feel super smooth!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy or sticky.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like this product. My brown spots are fading!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second reorder. It&#x27;s perfect to layer with other serums. Effective yet gentle enough to use every day. A great value!</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product... One of the best C serum&#x27;s I have ever tried. I have sensitive  skin. It brings clarity to the skin refreshing the face. The texture of the skin is changed  daily .. More youthful . I love it ! Get it !</li>
    <li> PROBLEM:  When I removed the plastic factory sealing to use the product, the lid itself wasn&#x27;t screwed on tightly, and out spilled a great amount ( almost 1/4 bottle???!!!)  of the contents onto the floor.  Agh!&lt;br /&gt;It seems like it works well after a few days, so we will see what happens in a week or two.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and I love it</li>
    <li> Love this and all the other TruSkin products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a month or so but I feel like my skin is beginning to look better already!</li>
    <li> have to use longer before seeing results</li>
    <li> I have only had the product for 4 days, so I will update my review after a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had already started using Carrot Seed oil and Neem oil last year, and living in a desert this has helped immensely. However, I had noticed more recently a lack of radiance, dullness, and unevenness, so I added Rose Hip Oil and Black Cumin Seed Oil to the regime. Again this helped some, but in only 4 days I am seeing a great improvement with this combination plus the C serum added. My skin is more radiant, youthful, and even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this initial 4 days I was with my aunt, 10 years my senior, she is 42 and having similar issues. I used my regime on her as well and in only 5 applications she was thrilled with her progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for 4 stars is that I am waiting to see how much improvement I have after a few weeks and a few months. I have been blessed with aging very well, but I missed that glow and not needing makeup. I do suggest this product especially for my vegan and gluten free friends looking for a good skin care regime. I will be purchasing one of these for each of my female family members for the holidays.</li>
    <li> Great product, feels nice, evening out my skin tone...will continue to use:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product two or three weeks, but have already noticed a tightening of my skin, and my pores are shrinking. It seems to be a very good product -- so good, in fact, that I ordered the other two products that are supposed to be used with it. I&#x27;m 60 years old, and haven&#x27;t always taken great care of my skin, so I&#x27;m trying to make up a bit for lost time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an initial trial, the product has done better than anything I&#x27;ve used to date, and the fact that it&#x27;s not tested on animals is paramount in my choice! In short: I&#x27;m very pleased with these results.</li>
    <li> What a great product !!!</li>
    <li> It feels great on the skin and it does help reduce age marks. I loved the follow-up email sent by the seller. Great job! I&#x27;ll buy more product soon.</li>
    <li> So far I used 2 bottle is I find it really helpful with my skin...I recommend to my sister also due to she has sun spots...I will order more for sure!&lt;br /&gt; thank you! greatly appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Great product, good results.  No irritation to date and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I am a &amp;#34;Legit Customer&amp;#34; and I am not getting paid for commenting!  I love this product! It is not greasy nor oily, and dries very quickly! However, once I received the product( Vitamin C Serum )  I used it the same day, after washing my face, and I have used it everyday since. Honestly, I already see changes in my skin tone- I have a few spots that are a bit darker on my upper cheeks, in which, they are beginning to become lighter already. I also, have a few fine lines on my forehead and they also appear to become faint. I love this product and I will continue to use this!  In addition, I thought I read the description before ordering that the would help with acne ? I have experienced random break outs lately and I applied the vitamin  C on them, however, I could not tell if it made them better or if they worsen, but they were not going away, therefore, I stopped applying it where I had breakouts. Suggestions?</li>
    <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m actually quite impressed with the serum. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now but I can actually see a difference! In fact, I think I saw difference after only two days. My skin is noticeably less wrinkly and happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week now, my skin is smooth and some of my acne scars are little bit lighter. I used it twice a day and it absorb to my skin quickly. I will try the Retinol serum for sure. Definitely will purchase this Vitamin C serum again. By the way, the shipping is really fast, placed the order on Wednesday and got the package on Friday.</li>
    <li> Love this product, does everything it claims. My skin looks bright, feels smooth and soft. My pores appear smaller. The price is excellent for this serum and the customer service is awesome. If you&#x27;re on the fence about this serum, I say try it! You&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> So far has done nothing for my skin. I use it AM/PM for 3 weeks now and see no improvement. Too expensive to see no results.&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have tried 3 other Vitamin C serums in the last several months and this one is my favorite.  The feel on my face is the nicest and I see the best results.  Moreover, the ingredients are superior (the type of vitamin C used).</li>
    <li> i love the serum..i have been using in morning and night and i have noticed that brown spots on side of my chin have faded big time and skin have become so much soft...and i love that how it dries up on skin and doesn&#x27;t leave that oily feeling at all...</li>
    <li> This product is ah-mazing. Before this, I didn&#x27;t use any other products but cleanser and lotion on my face, before this C Serum. I read the reviews and went with my gut on choosing between the different Vitamin C Serum brands and carriers on Amazon. After days of research, TruSkin seemed to have the most helpful reviews. After days and hours of sifting, I read one woman drastically decreased her sun spots and someone else a scar. I was looking for someone to say they had dark circles under their eyes and I was looking for whiteheads or white bumps under the eyes. I didn&#x27;t find that anywhere. Those were my problems. Soon after I started using TruSkin&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum everyday, sometimes twice, for a few weeks, the circles under my eyes that I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to get rid of, even with 12-8 hours of sleep a night! subtly began fading away. I take medication so sometimes sleep a lot, up to 12 hours, but have never been able to get rid of my dark circles. I&#x27;ve gained an unhealthy pale complexion since I started taking my medication as well. Something else that began to happen the more I used the C Serum was that the whiteheads under my eyes I had been so desperate to get rid of, slowly began minimizing!! And over these last three months, the skin that was once very bumpy is actually now smooth!! The white heads are gone. I don&#x27;t say this lightly: TruSkin&#x27;s Vitamin C serum has produced miraculous results. I&#x27;ve had problem skin under my eyes since I was a child, at 31, it&#x27;s now cleared up! Also, my skin has gone from very pale to &amp;#34;vibrant&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; such claim my compliments. Erica&#x27;s customer care is personal and kind. I had to let her know all about my findings, as I truly am amazed by this product. The company behind this product is just as honest and caring. I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re trying to choose a C serum, or if you&#x27;re not sure if you need a C serum. Try this and be ah-mazed!</li>
    <li> I use this after using the exfoliating sponge and it seems to be softening my skin and reducing fine lines.  I have an old face so I don&#x27;t expect miracles.  I have weeks to go before results will be clear, but so far so good.  I like the fact it has no fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using on the back of my hands and face n neck..  Really smooths out the wrinkles n not oily at all.  I wait a few mins n apply make up right over top!I absolutely love the serum.  It making my skin so soft and making my face and back of hands smooth.  I think I&#x27;ve went a little crazy with it because I&#x27;m almost out already?   I just love the way it makes my skin feel even after washing my hands over and over they still stay very soft.  My concern is with the dark/age spots it has really not done anything to fade them so I guess I need the retinol?    I would like to have all of them!   I&#x27;m 45 but I have the start of sun damage on my face n hands so Id really like to see them disappear!</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the Vitamin C Serum and use it twice a day. I even put it on the back of my hands. I think the sun spots have lightened since I started using it.</li>
    <li> This serum has been wonderful on my sensitive skin. It nourishes and repairs my skin after depleting it through running, swimming, and general sun exposure.  I appreciate the high quality ingredients. I have tried comparable serums, like Andalou Naturals Rose Serum, and I keep reaching for this one instead because it goes on light and never bothers my skin or causes breakouts. It actually seems to soothe and help heal blemishes. I can use it under my tinted spf in the morning, and I use it at night under my moisturizer. The company has excellent customer service as well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I really love the way my skin looks since I started using the Vitamin C Serum. It&#x27;s smoother, more even toned, less oily and my pores are smaller. It&#x27;s been only about two weeks but I&#x27;m very pleased. My order was shipped and arrived super fast. It&#x27;s easy to use. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results this fast but I&#x27;m so happy that I have!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day. I wash my face then I use the Vitsmin C serum before applying my moisturizer and make up. I can&#x27;t wait to see how I look in two more weeks. This is going to be a permanent addition to my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Love it! In just 1 week my skin has never been so soft and less wrinkles. Will continue to use for life. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I was actually thinking today, that I was finally noticing a change in my skin.  It has taken me a while to get into a routine, since I retired a few months ago, but I have really put forth the effort this time and I&#x27;m liking the results.  After trying many, many, many different products, it&#x27;s nice to see something actually happening.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; I bought the serum because of the vitamin C and the hyaluronic acid.  I didn&#x27;t realize that it was organic until I read the bottle.  That was an uber plus for me.  I also like that there is no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; I&#x27;ve paired it with a moisturizer by ROC and I am really pleased with how soft my skin feels.  I hope these results continue.  I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed that someone will ask me what I&#x27;ve been using!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Thank you for this product.  I am really impressed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love  this product!!! My skin is softer and looks glowing! Can&#x27;t wait to try more of these products!</li>
    <li> It is good product!VeryGood I L0ve it！</li>
    <li> I am 58 yrs old and I have an autoimmune disorder that makes my skin very dry.  This serum has helped with the dried out, sick look of my skin.  My husband said it just makes me look less sick.  In my case that is a very, very good thing.  I also use it on my neck. I HAD rosacea but my skin has calmed down a lot and looks better than it has for 50 years.&lt;br /&gt;With an autoimmune illness your body starts attacking itself including the skin.  When I apply the serum to my upper forehead I apply it up to where I have lost hair.  I&#x27;m trying not to lose any more. Will it help?  I don&#x27;t know, but it can&#x27;t hurt.  My doctor said to use as many antioxidants and anti-inflammatories as I can for the autoimmune problems. I do feel that the Vitamin C serum gives me some autoimmune skin protection.&lt;br /&gt;Using the Vitamin C Serum also helps me feel more confident.  If you ask me how it is helping me, I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m a lot less shy about people seeing my skin in the sunlight.  That&#x27;s HUGE.  Thank you TruSkin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum from TruSkin for just over two weeks and a number of my friends have commented on how good my skin looks.  I intend to keep using this product on an ongoing basis.</li>
    <li> I really like the Vitamin C Serum.  I am starting to see a difference in my skin.  It has more of a glow and the fine lines and wrinkles are now not as harsh.  Customer service is outstanding!</li>
    <li> This serum dried my skin.  Not great for me, but could work for others.  On the plus side, I think the company is a good one and the product is likely high quality.  They even sent me a follow up email to see how I was liking their product.  Great service!</li>
    <li> Yes, I love the serum! My skin is looking smoother as the wrinkles around my eyes are not as deep. I feel my skin looks about 5 years younger in just the short time I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum truly works, thank you very much!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone who has problems with fine lines and under eye darkness. I have really dark circles under my eyes and after about a month of using this product, the darkness has reduced significantly. Now when I take photos, people comment on how much younger and different I look. I used to always get comments that I looked tired and my eyes were too dark underneath. Now they take notice that my eyes don&#x27;t look like raccoon eyes anymore. In addition to a great product, the customer service from this company is EXCELLENT!! I cannot tell you how helpful they have been in trying to resolve an issue that I had with one of my orders. They took every step possible to ensure that they knew what the problem was and try to resolve it in any way possible. Even though it was a minor issue, they treated me as though my satisfaction and happiness was all that mattered. Definitely try this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks. I use it morning and night before my moisturizer. It dries quicker than I expected. It&#x27;s not a clear formula. It looks cloudy with slight bubbles on top. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but purchased it based on high reviews and was tired of trying various products that didn&#x27;t produce quick enough results before the product was empty. I have used about 1/4 of the bottle thus far and have to say I am noticing some obvious improvements in the tone of my skin. My issues were age spots and fine lines. I have had melasma for about 7 years and have tried Nu-Derm and some prescription meds but didn&#x27;t like the side effects of the various chemicals and the changes were not permanent.  This product though? It works. And quickly, My forehead spots have lightened significantly and I feel like my skin is clear and smooth. My pores are shrinking and I dare to say the fine lines are fading. Is that possible? I can only say yes. I will continue using this product with the hopes of it working even more and more as time goes on. I&#x27;m so thankful to have discovered this rare gem and for trusting the high reviews!</li>
    <li> Skin feels good time needed for test results</li>
    <li> Good but slow with results</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Best vitamin C ever. Excellent customer service. Works perfectly with dark spot, in just two weeks I had results.</li>
    <li> This is for my husband to buy, well absorbed! What effect has long been known to be used to.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serums for years.  This one has no added color or scent which I like.  It absorbs quickly and is doing it&#x27;s part to help reduce the signs of aging on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Best customer service. Serum doesn&#x27;t smell, goes on smooth, and I saw changes in my skin using it twice a day with my first bottle. Would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum. I can see a difference in my complexion after a few weeks of using it. It&#x27;s non-oily, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, doesn&#x27;t sting, don&#x27;t smell bad.. It&#x27;s an all-around great product.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and you only need a small amount.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes my skin feel soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Hooray, I&#x27;m so ecstatic to write out these things as a confirm for what I can see how the serum has been working on my skin &#x27;til now! It&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks from the day I started applying it on &amp; you know, I&#x27;m kind of having some (about total 6) dark spots on my both cheeks!  &amp; I&#x27;ve been using the serum only 1 (sometime 2 for day) time at night &amp; all I can see right now is that they almost disappeared  for 4 lighter spots, only 2 darkers are still visible, they fade away though! Wow, sounds like miracle, right? &amp; you know, my husband decided to give it a try already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are all I can tell you about your product now! And I definitely let you know more in near future once it brings me the best results as I wish!</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum is working wonders on my skin!! *****CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AMAZING!!!!*******</li>
    <li> Best customer service ever.  And what a great price for a 20% C serum.</li>
    <li> I love the serum I don&#x27;t notice any thing I don&#x27;t like about it I do notice it&#x27;s helping with dryness being that I live in Jersey were having some cold harsh winter weather I think the serum helps hydrate my skin I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering thank you :)</li>
    <li> My skin looks and feels better since I started using the serum . I will definitely buy again .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have used this Serum long enough to give a review on it.  One thing I have noticed, though, is my face is not oily or greasy after putting it on like a LOT of other products I have used.  I like that.  If it works like it says it will, then I will come back in a few weeks and update my post.</li>
    <li>  is nice to have a great experience, and with this product from start to finish I am 100% satisfied. I have already purchased my backup so i know i have it for continued use. Thank you amazon.com and the products/services you offer.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. it keeps getting better and better too!</li>
    <li> I ordered the hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, and the retinal 2.5 and I love them all!!! I have used them for 3 weeks and can definitely see the difference. The puffiness is gone and my skin feels much tighter and smoother!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to leave feedback or review a product but my experience with this serum AND the interaction with TruSkin representatives leave me no choice...I am SO impressed! The serum is like laying down a red carpet for your other skincare products...it seems to make those products more effective while also leaving skin glowing and silky soft. The follow up from Erica at TruSkin was personal and genuine and they surely have a customer for life in me.</li>
    <li> No problem with delivery. The product is intact. So far, no problems. Does not irritate my skin. Too early to tell if it will reduce wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Loving my results so far! UPDATE - I absolutely love this serum. My acne is clearing up and my skin is glowing. Customer service is great! Thank you Erica, for everything!! I need to order more!</li>
    <li> Product smells like overnight cheeseburger and it just like plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS ITEM. MYSELF WILL NOT BIY FROM THIS BRAND EVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Extremely good product, skin feels incredibly smooth the very next day.  The seller is very professional and truly gives 5* customer service!</li>
    <li> Not as advertised. This product is not for sensitive skin and caused welts and a rash on my face. Not happy with the return policy as it does not offer a readily available email address as advertised to contact if not satisfied to process the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see below :&lt;br /&gt;WORKS OR YOUR MONEY BACK ◀ - TruSkin Naturals is a different kind of company that prides themself in providing the absolute best customer service in the industry. If for any reason you decide that this vitamin c serum is not for you, you have a full 3 months to send 1 simple email and receive a 100% money-back refund, absolutely no questions asked (in fact, you don&#x27;t even have to return the bottle).</li>
    <li> I love this product.it makes my skin soft and radiant.I will definitely  buy it again.</li>
    <li> I can speak for the results yet, but I hate the eye dropper.  It wastes too much product and is hard to apply.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second bottle of TruSkin Naturals Serum through Amazon. Since using it (about 2 months), I have definitely seen an improvement with the dark spots/patches I had developed due to Melasma. I like everything about the serum. It feels clean on the skin and is easy to apply in both hot and cold weather. Several people have commented on a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; on my face! You should be confident in the quality of your product. I am grateful that it&#x27;s on the market! Many thanks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the product!!!! My skin looks amazing!!! The product is:&lt;br /&gt;•  Very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;•  Very fast absorbing&lt;br /&gt;•  Makes my skin very smooth &amp; soft&lt;br /&gt;•  Made my skin lighter (after 2 weeks of use!)&lt;br /&gt;•  Has no color, smell,  etc… which I love&lt;br /&gt;I will be definitely ordering another bottle!!</li>
    <li> seems to be effective so far after short use.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum for the backs of my hands.  I&#x27;m 52 and age spots are popping out here and there on my hands.  Ugh.  I had already been using a cream for aging on my hands since last September but wanted to add a serum.  I&#x27;ve now been using the Vitamin C Serum for a couple of months and my age spots have faded some. Of course I never expected them to fade completely, but they do look better.  I&#x27;m hopeful that I&#x27;ll continue to see more results in the future.  I also like the consistency of the serum.  Not gooey and soaks right in.  Which is nice.  Also nice is the customer service of this company.  They followed up to give me instructions on the way to apply/use the product, and to see if I was happy with the product.  I&#x27;ve never had a company do that.</li>
    <li> Great serum! While it has a medicinal smell, it works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky like other vitamin serums I have tried. They also have amazing Customer Service. Very impressed with this company.</li>
    <li> The skin looks softer after 3 weeks of use, better than any night cream I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> 5 stars. I generally have healthy skin, heals from within, until about three years ago, one month use of Clearasil Ultra facewash damaged it deeply. My skin, particularly around the nose up to the area between the eyebrows and partial of skin where eyebrows grow, down to the area surrounding my lips, suffered from extremely dry conditions that caused redness, rashes, and flakes. Looked terrible. I used traditional remedial oils, olive oil, argan oil, castor oil, tea tree oil, and they all failed. I used Eucerin, Aquaphor advanced therapy, cocoa butter, and they only helped reducing the redness, rashes and flakes. I thought I had no choice but would have to go with expensive physician visits and prescribed medicines. Thanks goodness. I came across articles about Vit C serum, and searched for it in my Amazon account. I bought and use this brand last month. The result was immediate and my face skin is gradually showing improvements within the first two weeks. Then I bought another bottle of different brand OZ radiance (lower price) and use them interchangeably. Those &amp;#34;f&amp;#34;ugly rashes, redness and flakes are disappearing. I guess this Vit C serum with hyaluronic acid (I hope I spelled it right) really heals and improve skin condition from within. Well ... I imagine they revitalize skin cells. Thanks to you guys and gals who produce and sell this product.</li>
    <li> This serum is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing so many positive reviews. I thought it would probably be a good one.&lt;br /&gt;It did not work at allm&lt;br /&gt;Its too sticky, dried my skin out so bad and irritated my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Will never purchase again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother ordering!  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I love it thats why i ordered it again it really makes my skin feel and look great i will continue to order it. it really does make a big difference i just love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C serum about 4 weeks ago, and I am extremely pleased with the results. My skin feels firmer and my pores look smaller. The serum is silky to the touch, and, like a sponge, my skin absorbs it quickly and completely. I use it twice a day in combination with a charcoal soap, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I apply it just under my day/night moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product very quickly from the company - ordered it on a Friday and received it by Monday. And, as satisfied and happy as I am with the serum, I am equally impressed with the TruSkin Naturals company. I received an email from &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; (an employee of the company) just 2 days after I placed my order and before the serum arrived (Sunday). She thanked me for my purchase; advised me to contact her if there were any problems with shipping; and informed me that she would be sending another email with explicit directions for its use. She was as good as her word - her email arrived on the next day - the same day as the package. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She emailed me again last week to inquire about my satisfaction with the Vitamin C serum; and, if I had any questions or concerns. I honestly can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this company&#x27;s stellar customer service skills. It&#x27;s so refreshing to know that a company cares about its customers. Of course, given the fact that they sell a very effective skin care product, well, it is simply icing on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, I don&#x27;t recommend products when I review them on Amazon, but I do recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again, &amp;#34;E&amp;#34;, and TruSkin Naturals. You guys rock! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is a professional grade anti aging and moisturizing serum which contains a high grade of vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly enjoying using this serum.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be very careful what I put on it as I tend to break out very easily, but this serum has not bothered my face at all so far.  I use it once a day at night after washing my face, and it soaks right in. I then apply my regular moisturizer after it and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will wait a bit longer and then will start applying it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Not so great. Has a strange smell. No expiry date so I was unable to tell if it was expired. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 59 and have been at altitude all my life water and snow skiing. Lots of sun even before sunscreen. I&#x27;ve had sun spots developing for years. One on my cheek bone area I&#x27;ve had burned off three times. Used $100 a bottle bleach cream 2 ounce from the dermatologist. Always came back. Even my recent MD said the only thing to do, is have it cut out. Well I&#x27;m not ready for that. Especially after using this Vita C Serum. After two weeks its fading and my whole face is looking evenly colored and bright. Put some moisturizer on after it dries and  I&#x27;m got that fresh 20 min of sun look.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post again after a few months.</li>
    <li> I love Vitamin C in general.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I highly recommend!!!</li>
