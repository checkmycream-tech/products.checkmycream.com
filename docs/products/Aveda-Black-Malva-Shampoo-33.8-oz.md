      <li>A great price on an outstanding shampoo that I used to buy at salons.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing as well.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice and cleans your hair well, but I don&#x27;t see any kind of darkening effect which is why I bought the shampoo to begin with.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>However, when used in combination with a hydrating conditioner, this shampoo leaves hair with a refreshing color-boost that silky and shiny.</li>
      <li>It was more of a dye than a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Product smells nice and seems gentle to scalp and hair.</li>

      <li>use the conditioner occasionally to give an extra kick of color, but the combination feels kind of drying to my hair, so I only use the malva conditioner on occasion, and I combine it with another condition</li>
      <li>A nice thick texture.  </li>
      <li>so I still get the hydration, but I usually just use a regular conditioner safe for color treated hair that is super hydrating (frizz ease is great)&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I am willing to pay extra for this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also mild enough that I can use it daily.</li>
      <li>Make sure  to read the label this shampoo turns your hair black, like really black.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for five years to find a product that rejuvenates my overly processed hair. Look no further! My hair is shiny, sleek and beautiful again. I use it along with black mulva conditioner. Totally worth the money and it smells amazing!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome. Makes hair so perfect feeling even before conditioner. Cleans great and smells great. Works better than my old kerastase</li>
    <li> Great for making grey hair have a silver sheen. Hard to find other than on Internet.</li>
    <li> It smells nice and cleans your hair well, but I don&#x27;t see any kind of darkening effect which is why I bought the shampoo to begin with. For the price, I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> for those of you who do not want the \\&quot;boot black\\&quot; look of a permanent dye and to take the red out of dark hair - terrific</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay attention to price like I usually do and found it was more expensive than from the manufacture.  Disappointed I usually find prices are very  competitive it was almost $10 difference</li>
    <li> I am willing to pay extra for this product. It does what it says it is supost to. Excelent packageing.. Price right. and recieved in a timly maner. I did not freeze even in the MN cold. That was really important to me. and it was stuck outside more then 12 hrs.Good Job!</li>
    <li> Make sure  to read the label this shampoo turns your hair black, like really black.  I Turned your hair black or green.  Not for highlighted or gray hair.  It was more of a dye than a shampoo.  I bought it to remove brassiness from my hair but it turned my hair almost black.  It looked very rich and pretty except for the fact that I had highlights that turned green.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair shine and stay silver.  It lathers well, smells good and rinses completely.  The best part is that there is no residue or discoloring of my hair.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> The product is as advertised, but the amount charged ($54.00 USD) was beyond what they sold at the stores. Just be aware of that fact.</li>
    <li> This product is great for people with gray hair as it brightens up drabby hair!  I love this product.  I only use it every other day.</li>
    <li> Aveda product.Great shampoo. Accents the dark highlights in my hair. Product smells nice and seems gentle to scalp and hair. Good price for an</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Aveda.  What else is there to say?</li>
    <li> I use this because I dye my hair black and it keeps my roots from showing longer (I have pretty light hair.) It works to the point where years ago when I was and then stopped dying my hair black, all I did was keep using the shampoo daily and just a regular conditioner until it the dye faded enough. Couldn&#x27;t even tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I use the conditioner occasionally to give an extra kick of color, but the combination feels kind of drying to my hair, so I only use the malva conditioner on occasion, and I combine it with another condition so I still get the hydration, but I usually just use a regular conditioner safe for color treated hair that is super hydrating (frizz ease is great)&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff - especially for the next time I decide to stop dying my hair... save several hundred on color treatments!!</li>
    <li> A great price on an outstanding shampoo that I used to buy at salons. I have gray hair, and this keeps it looking sparkly and dramatic. It&#x27;s also mild enough that I can use it daily.</li>
    <li> I tried this on the advice of my stylist.  I quit coloring my hair about 11 years ago and it has turned a beautiful silver.  This shampoo is fantastic for gray hair!!!!  It gives it a bright shine - no yellowing.</li>
    <li> Silky, smooth, ample and full lather.  Leaves silver hair looking like sparkly icicles.  It has a fresh, sweet scent.  Purple tones the hair but doesn&#x27;t stain the tub.  A nice thick texture.  I leave it on for about 5 minutes before rinsing once or twice the week to tone down any brassy aspects of my hair.</li>
    <li> Newly grow part of my gray hair is black. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Aveda color-depositing products are my favorite products for extending the life of my professional color.  Specifically, this shampoo is effective for temporarily blending my blonde regrowth with my dark auburn hair.  I often mix it with Aveda&#x27;s Madder Root conditioner in order to create a dark auburn hue.  For those who want to darken their hair without adding reddish undertones or to minimize brassiness, this shampoo is a great choice.  The smell is amazing as well.  The shampoo can be a little drying for those of us with coarse, thick hair.  However, when used in combination with a hydrating conditioner, this shampoo leaves hair with a refreshing color-boost that silky and shiny.</li>
