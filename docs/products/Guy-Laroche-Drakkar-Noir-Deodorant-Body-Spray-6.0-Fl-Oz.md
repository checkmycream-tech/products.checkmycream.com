      <li>The product is a great price</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a magnate of sorts and at times a great conversation starter.</li>
      <li>Great stuff.  </li>

      <li>Great product for a good price</li>

      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Good luck smelling good.</li>
      <li>Best price around and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Yes it was what I needed and I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Great snell and is my favorite</li>
      <li>I have to apply it two or three times a day to stay effective</li>
      <li>loved the smell and endurance :)</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Eternity, but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>on nicely and lasts a dog&#x27;s age.  </li>
      <li>Nice to use on a night out with your lady.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, Drakkar  is the best in business</li>
      <li>This is the type of deodorant that you need to put on more than once a day.</li>
      <li>it need four more words</li>
      <li>The deodorant starts off smelling great like Drakkar, but eventually settles into a calmer scent that isn&#x27;t so much like Drakkar.</li>
      <li>Drakkar Noir is my favorite, but doesn&#x27;t have the staying power it once did.</li>
      <li>I always love the smell of drakkar.</li>
      <li>Always appropriate.</li>
      <li>Have used this deodorant for 30 years and love it.</li>
      <li>but then again they don&#x27;t smell as good as Drakkar ;)</li>
      <li>Oh smells sooooo good on my husband, always loved the drakkar cologne on him, totally him</li>
      <li>That being said, unless you are familiar with a product, it&#x27;s probably best to buy locally.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly my wife loves the scent on me.</li>
      <li>Personally, I love its scent, mild elegant yet not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Too strong.  </li>
      <li>Still too strong.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It basically comes down to what smell you like best.  </li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant...priced well and got it quickly.  </li>
      <li>It is such a great smell for a man.</li>
      <li>, I am sure you will see what I mean when you try it.&lt;br /&gt;You will find that it is the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Drakkar is my daily-go-to, Chevy-V8 product for smelling clean without overpowering ladies in elevators.</li>
      <li>Not bad but does not last during a good workout.  </li>
      <li>It smells more like a cheap knock off of Old Spice.</li>
      <li>This classic scent is defined by a brisk top note blend of lemon zest, lavender and peppercorn.</li>
      <li>I used to pay more at the high fashion mall stores.</li>
      <li>I normally live in Canada and would have to pay significantly more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just too strong and has too much of an alcohol smell for me.  </li>
      <li>You would be much better off buying Old Spice or Tag or what ever deoderant you prefer.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right, I said it.</li>
      <li>Keeps me smelling like a hot movie celeb</li>
      <li>but my local store no longer carries Drakkar and I am glad to have found it online at Amazon.</li>
      <li>The only product of it&#x27;s type I&#x27;ve used for many years.</li>
      <li>This is a clean, fresh scent rather than any heavy or overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I have a stick of Calvin Klein Eternity deodorant that typically takes 10 swipes per arm to be effective.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance layering helps when you really start to sweat.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
      <li>Works really well for me.</li>
      <li>Other than that, OK product.</li>
      <li>Nice smell but fades and loses a bit of effectiveness on extremely hot days</li>
      <li>A good value since it seems to be less watered down or aired up than the cheap, mass-merchandized brands.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this classic product for years.  </li>
      <li>Never a complaint - from me or anyone else.</li>
      <li>The first time I put this deodorant on, I did the ten swipe thing...</li>
      <li>a complete rip off.</li>
      <li>This challenge is compounded by the fact that Amazon has not yet developed the smellernet, so we can&#x27;t smell online.  </li>
      <li>I would go so far as to call this stuff</li>
      <li>If you became an adult in the 90s</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, deodorant sticks don&#x27;t smell exactly like their cologne counterpart and most stores</li>
      <li>Barely scented and once applied causes sticky residue.</li>
      <li>Wheather showing horses, at boardroom meetings, at the beach or casino having an energized time, I am constantly stopped by women (sometimes guys) and asked what My cologne or aftershave brand is and not uncommonly their response is \\&quot;that is the most delectible fragrance I&#x27;ve ever smelled on a man.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as Old Spice, or Speed Sticks</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband considers this his staple.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered. I normally live in Canada and would have to pay significantly more.</li>
    <li> Barely scented and once applied causes sticky residue.</li>
    <li> This deoderant smells nothing like the cologne. It smells more like a cheap knock off of Old Spice. That&#x27;s right, I said it. You would be much better off buying Old Spice or Tag or what ever deoderant you prefer. It probobly has a better scent, can&#x27;t be much worse in any case, and will be far less expensive. I would go so far as to call this stuff a complete rip off.</li>
    <li> put it on when your wearing the cologne .OOOOOOOOOOOOH YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get it get it git it need four more words</li>
    <li> Really good price even with shipping. Works really well for me. Most importantly my wife loves the scent on me.</li>

    <li> Great stuff.  Keeps me smelling like a hot movie celeb no matter how ugly I am in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on nicely and lasts a dog&#x27;s age.  A good value since it seems to be less watered down or aired up than the cheap, mass-merchandized brands.  I like using it in conjunction with Drakkar&#x27;s facial balm and spray cologne.  This is a clean, fresh scent rather than any heavy or overwhelming.  Consequently, other than with the cologne, it&#x27;s hard to use too much though a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drakkar is my daily-go-to, Chevy-V8 product for smelling clean without overpowering ladies in elevators.</li>
    <li> I have used Drakkar after shave and under-arm deodorant exclusively for at least 15 years. Wheather showing horses, at boardroom meetings, at the beach or casino having an energized time, I am constantly stopped by women (sometimes guys) and asked what My cologne or aftershave brand is and not uncommonly their response is \\&quot;that is the most delectible fragrance I&#x27;ve ever smelled on a man. So, for me at 73 it&#x27;s a magnate of sorts and at times a great conversation starter. It&#x27;s not inexpensive as such, but I&#x27;ve always preferred results in lieu of cheapness; quality tells!</li>
    <li> High quality deodorant, long lasting and at an extremely affordable price! This classic scent is defined by a brisk top note blend of lemon zest, lavender and peppercorn. After purchasing several sticks of Drakkar Noir Deodorant, other brands such as Old Spice/Axe have become completely useless in comparison.</li>
    <li> I got two of them for $28. Great deal.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant...priced well and got it quickly.  I used to buy these at Macy&#x27;s but my local store no longer carries Drakkar and I am glad to have found it online at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not bad but does not last during a good workout.  Nice smell but fades and loses a bit of effectiveness on extremely hot days and/or during workouts.  Other than that, OK product.</li>
    <li> Drakkar Noir is my signature scent and I had to have the deodorant to match my cologne. The deodorant starts off smelling great like Drakkar, but eventually settles into a calmer scent that isn&#x27;t so much like Drakkar. Regardless, this is a great smelling deodorant but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as Old Spice, or Speed Sticks but then again they don&#x27;t smell as good as Drakkar ;)</li>
    <li> Nice to use on a night out with your lady. I combine it with Drakkar Noir men&#x27;s spray cologne for a blended effect.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, Drakkar  is the best in business</li>
    <li> Personally, I love its scent, mild elegant yet not too strong.  I have used it for years, great product for men.</li>
    <li> Great smell I always love the smell of drakkar. It is such a great smell for a man. I bought it for my husband both the roll on and the spray.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time. It&#x27;s a timeless fragrance. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use anything else.</li>
    <li> Have used this deodorant for 30 years and love it. Best price around and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Only deodorant I use.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  If you became an adult in the 90s this was your scent anthem.  Lol.</li>
    <li> I have a stick of Calvin Klein Eternity deodorant that typically takes 10 swipes per arm to be effective.  It smells great, so I don&#x27;t mind.  The first time I put this deodorant on, I did the ten swipe thing...whoa!  I was overwhelmed the entire day.  Too strong.  The next day, I did four swipes.  Still too strong.  Wash.  Re-apply.  Three swipes.  Good.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Eternity, but it&#x27;s okay.  Works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It basically comes down to what smell you like best.  Unfortunately, deodorant sticks don&#x27;t smell exactly like their cologne counterpart and most stores won&#x27;t let you bust open a deodorant stick to sniff it.  This challenge is compounded by the fact that Amazon has not yet developed the smellernet, so we can&#x27;t smell online.  That being said, unless you are familiar with a product, it&#x27;s probably best to buy locally.  Maybe you can open it when nobody is looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying another Drakkar Noir.  It&#x27;s just too strong and has too much of an alcohol smell for me.  Good luck smelling good.</li>
    <li> Of course it is personal but I like the sent. It is the only deodorant than does not itch. I have to apply it two or three times a day to stay effective</li>
    <li> not what I was expecting. Just alright</li>
    <li> loved the smell and endurance :)</li>
    <li> Good product great price</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price</li>
    <li> He gets compliments EVERY time when wearing the cologne and the deodorant. Fragrance layering helps when you really start to sweat.</li>
    <li> The only product of it&#x27;s type I&#x27;ve used for many years. Always appropriate. Always works. Never a complaint - from me or anyone else. Never an irritation. I used to pay more at the high fashion mall stores. Amazon to the rescue!</li>
    <li> Sucks. Couldn&#x27;t really smell it. This is the type of deodorant that you need to put on more than once a day. Very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The product is a great price BUT ... it&#x27;s advertised as the 2.6 oz. item&lt;br /&gt;and look closely ..... they display a picture of it as the 2.1 oz. item.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only half an ounce but this stuff is expensive. I&#x27;ve been duped by&lt;br /&gt;this bait and switch before. It wasn&#x27;t this seller but it&#x27;s hard to believe&lt;br /&gt;they would make that mistake.</li>
    <li> This &#x27;underarm&#x27; deodorant does not irritate my underarm as some other stick deodorant do. Been buying this for years.</li>
    <li> No smell.  didn&#x27;t it used to be stronger?  Drakkar Noir is my favorite, but doesn&#x27;t have the staying power it once did.</li>
    <li> Very good product, I have used Drakkar for years.</li>
    <li> this is the only deodorant my husband can use and in the store they all come as a set  so this works well</li>
    <li> Great snell and is my favorite, I am sure you will see what I mean when you try it.&lt;br /&gt;You will find that it is the best.</li>
    <li> Yes it was what I needed and I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Oh smells sooooo good on my husband, always loved the drakkar cologne on him, totally him</li>
    <li> Good product. smells great</li>
