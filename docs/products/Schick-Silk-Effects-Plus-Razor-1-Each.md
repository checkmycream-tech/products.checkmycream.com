      <li>Even though it&#x27;s not on the store shelves any longer, this is my favorite razor and easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver which does an ok job but still leaves a fine stubble.</li>

      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine.</li>

      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>how quickly I shave.</li>
      <li>The razor is pretty and easy to hold, so I was pretty excited to try it out.</li>
      <li>THIS RAZOR IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST EVER FOR EVERY YOUNG WOMAN JUST STARTING TO SHAVE AND</li>
      <li>They also sent adequate compensation in the form of coupons for another Schick product that I have previously used to great satisfaction.</li>
      <li>This thing works very good if you don&#x27;t press too hard.</li>
      <li>A smooth shave - no nicks, cuts or irritations, The refill blades last longer than disposable razors and do a better job.  </li>
      <li>I did not feel it fair to leave a bad review without making mention of their fabulous customer service and dedication to making their quality better and better.</li>
      <li>Even when the razors are new, the blade is smooth and \\&quot;ouch less\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Without the curve and swivel of most modern women&#x27;s razors, this razor leaves me wanting as far as a close shave is concerned.</li>
      <li>Other than the very girly design patterns on these things, they are perfect for guys looking to keep things smooth down there.</li>
      <li>This razor is very comfortable and compact enough for travel.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many others, but always come back to this one.</li>
      <li>My first time using it</li>
      <li>Figuring the same company was a safe bet, I bought the Silk Effects</li>
      <li>I just got it because i had a replacement i wanted to use, but its ok, nothing different from others</li>
      <li>I thought at first that I was the problem,</li>
      <li>I have some pretty hideous razor burn, despite what the product description says.</li>
      <li>Update - Used maybe ten times, started pinching more then shaving, tossed it.</li>
      <li>Okay, but not if wearing sleeveless or if anyone is getting close enough to touch you.  </li>
      <li>I also found a way to have the Silk Effects Plus blades last much longer by rinsing them under warm water and letting them air dry, before I put the top on.</li>
      <li>It is not flimsy like many others, feels sturdy, shaves closely without nicks and cuts, and the blade lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought, &amp;#34;OK, maybe I was using too much pressure or something&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I use it to shave sensitive areas and can do so quickly because I&#x27;ve gained 100% confidence that it will not cut no matter</li>
      <li>/&gt;The suction cup holder actually stays on my smooth plastic shower siding.</li>
      <li>No irritating scraping like a bladed razor.  </li>
      <li>I have been shaving for 10 years, and I have never done this much damage with a razor.</li>
      <li>Item as advertised, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I remembered it from my youth, but boy, it hasn&#x27;t changed much.</li>
      <li>Sometimes a four-blade monster is just too much, but disposibles are too flimsy and stationary.</li>
      <li>I really like my razor and wanted to keep using it.  </li>
      <li>I was so dissatisfied with the alternatives that I finally decided to look online, and fortunately found these.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t shake my allegiance to how well they work, so much so that I have a stockpile of refills in case</li>
      <li>It will work as the older one did, I would guess, but not the look we hoped for.</li>
      <li>even if I didn&#x27;t like the particular design this time around.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>This razor is highly underrated.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> ENJOYED THE PRODUCT. PAID $9.25 FOR IT AND AS SOON AS I RECEIVED IT I FOUND IT AT WALLMART FOR $3.OO.</li>
    <li> A great razor is hard to find, but fortunately not online. I am thrilled I can still buy the refills for my Silk Effects razor. I don&#x27;t care for the new razors because of the irritants that the lotions have in/on them. Silk Effects also doesn&#x27;t cut you like cheaper razors because of the wire guard over the blades.</li>
    <li> So happy I found these. They stopped carrying them in the store and I was able to stock pile quite a few without making a dent in my wallet.</li>
    <li> the product is not the greatest of razors, but I was just looking for something cheap. razors are so expensive these days!</li>
    <li> I gave up using a razor some time ago. Because of health reasons my skin has become extemely sensitive with puritus (itching) on my legs. I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver which does an ok job but still leaves a fine stubble. I was looking through the razor aisle just looking at prices. I spotted these as being the least expensive of the better razors (not in a 10 pack). I love it! You can&#x27;t even feel the wire, just a soft stroke on the leg. No irritating scraping like a bladed razor.  So far I have no itching and absolutely no nicks. If you have sensitive skin as far as abrasives go, give this a try.</li>
    <li> I friend gave me a ton of blades to this razor. I am the cheapest person when it comes to buying new blades. 7 dollars for the razor, then I go to get replacement blades and whaaaaa!? 26.99 for how many? 6!!! Oh, no. So, I have blades enough for a few years. She was going to throw them out because no one sells them any more. Um, hello? Amazon, I&#x27;ll take them. She was still doubtful. Now look who doesn&#x27;t have to buy blades for 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cup holder actually stays on my smooth plastic shower siding. That never happens! The razor fits so nicely in my hand and my legs are smooth and sexy for my Mr. We approve!</li>
    <li> All time favorite razor!</li>
    <li> Disappointed that the purple version didn&#x27;t come as the photo on the page shows. Instead we got what seems to be the new floral version. It will work as the older one did, I would guess, but not the look we hoped for. Arrived in good time.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love it. Needs more blades</li>
    <li> The newer version is too big and too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Why, when you find a perfect product, is it always discontinued?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a mystery</li>
    <li> excellent quality, I am very happy with it</li>
    <li> Good, gentle, effective shaver. Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Silk Effects Plus razor and refill blades for several years, and I hope they never stop making them.  Even when the razors are new, the blade is smooth and \\&quot;ouch less\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m a 66-year old female who now finds that she has to shave her chin every two to three days, so my Schick Silk Effects Plus razor does the trick nicely (without lather).  I also found a way to have the Silk Effects Plus blades last much longer by rinsing them under warm water and letting them air dry, before I put the top on.</li>
    <li> Horrible shave.  Not full of nicks or anything, but this thing cannot do a very good close shave.  I brought it on vacation with me to try it out and had to toss it and go get disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the holster.</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST EVER FOR EVERY YOUNG WOMAN JUST STARTING TO SHAVE AND FOR THE SEASONED VETERAN WOMAN....  I STARTED MY 13 YEAR OLD OFF ON IT AND NOW MY 11 YEAR OLD...... I JUST KEEP BUYING MORE OF THEM BECAUSE IT IS CHEAPER TO BUY THE WHOLE SYSTEM WITH 2 REFILLS THAN IT IS TO JUST BUY THE REFILLS.....  ******* 10 STARS FOR THIS RAZOR WITH THE TINY WIRES THAT GO ACROSS THE BLADES IT MAKES IT GREAT FOR  NO CUTS................ AND SHAVING IS A NO WORRY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO CUT YOURSELF......  NICE JOB SCHICK.......</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how much better this razor is than other razors because all the ones I&#x27;ve gotten lately leave my skin very smooth including this one.  This one is a little thicker to hold, an unusual shape for me but it&#x27;s fine. It is certainly prettier than any other razors that I&#x27;ve  gotten. Nice and feminine.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Silk Effects Razor to any other, no they are not the cheapest, but they also perform far better and last longer.  A smooth shave - no nicks, cuts or irritations, The refill blades last longer than disposable razors and do a better job.  I have used a lot of different razors over the years and this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this razor a try because I wasn&#x27;t happy with my current razor.  My current razor had soap surrounding the blade which was nice but the soap had harsh sulfates in it and caused itching and irritation.  It was also caused nicks and irritation near the bikini area.  This razor is great.  No irritation from soap and does an excellent job in the bikini area.  Highly recommend and will be purchasing replacement blades.</li>
    <li> Shaves close. Effects is a good razor.  I have bought several on sale and really like the close shave it gives.</li>
    <li> I love the little suction cup caddy so you can stick it to the side of the shower, but falls off the wall by tub.  Comes with a total of two blades so you will need refills soon. Just started using this not sure how long a blade will last but I will update. Used four times, have not cut myself yet. Does not give close shave, underarms take forever and still can not cut all the hair. Okay, but not if wearing sleeveless or if anyone is getting close enough to touch you.  Buy again or refills, no.  Update - Used maybe ten times, started pinching more then shaving, tossed it.</li>
    <li> This razor is very comfortable and compact enough for travel.  The replacement blades last a long time, even with daily use.  Great product!</li>
    <li> It is difficult to find this type of razor (or blades) in regular retail stores, so I was excited to see it offered on Amazon. However, The item I received is not the plain lavender razor that is pictured, but a dark purple with ugly 70&#x27;s-style flowers on it. I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine, but Ugh, this is ugly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these shavers for a long time. They&#x27;re getting difficult to find. The price is not great and the one I received was pink with flowers. Still a good shaver even if I didn&#x27;t like the particular design this time around.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite razor.  It is not flimsy like many others, feels sturdy, shaves closely without nicks and cuts, and the blade lasts a long time.  I have tried many others, but always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> My favorite razor for intimate areas. Sometimes a four-blade monster is just too much, but disposibles are too flimsy and stationary. This razor is just the right trick for tight areas!</li>
    <li> Got it on sale and thought I&#x27;ll give it a try. Not getting the same close, even shave as with Venus. Ok, to have as back-up razor if needed.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  I never have razor cuts, it is easy to grip and a good cost.&lt;br /&gt;Best shaver I have ever used.  It is the best shaver outt there for the money.</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s not on the store shelves any longer, this is my favorite razor and easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. I bought it because I had leftover blades and could not find the razor at the store. Works as well as I remembered</li>
    <li> I bought this because I remembered it from my youth, but boy, it hasn&#x27;t changed much. Without the curve and swivel of most modern women&#x27;s razors, this razor leaves me wanting as far as a close shave is concerned. It does the job, just not nearly well enough. Schick is a great brand, but I&#x27;d suggest the Hydro instead.</li>
    <li> Have had this razor since it came on the market.  Love that it has a substantial handle...feels much better to hold on to than regular ladies&#x27; shavers!  Bought these so that I don&#x27;t ever run out!  So comfortable!</li>
    <li> I had one of these razors for years. Traveled and left it in a hotel tub. Couldn&#x27;t find one in a local store to replace it, so ordered a new one online after trying three other razors that just didn&#x27;t make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude and I love this razor. Obviously marketed toward women for leg shaving, this thing will work for anyone shaving anywhere they dont want to cut. I use it to shave sensitive areas and can do so quickly because I&#x27;ve gained 100% confidence that it will not cut no matter how quickly I shave. Used to use the Schick Protector but those replacement blades are ridiculously expensive. Can still get these replacement blades fairly cheaply and I hope it stays that way. Other than the very girly design patterns on these things, they are perfect for guys looking to keep things smooth down there.</li>
    <li> What can I say - I have been using the Schick Silk Effects razors since they came out decades ago.  I can&#x27;t shake my allegiance to how well they work, so much so that I have a stockpile of refills in case they ever discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to try other razors since the Silk Effects stopped being carried by stores in my area. I was so dissatisfied with the alternatives that I finally decided to look online, and fortunately found these. I find them easier to hold and maneuver than razors with thin, stick-like handles. It&#x27;s easier to get a close shave too. I hope Schick keeps making them.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Arrivesd on time. Not sure what else to say to fill the space about razor blades. Two more words needed.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for 10 years, and I have never done this much damage with a razor. I ran out of Schick Intuition refills and needed a cheaper alternative. Figuring the same company was a safe bet, I bought the Silk Effects Plus. The razor is pretty and easy to hold, so I was pretty excited to try it out. That is, until I got out of the shower realized that my legs were all cut up! One is so deep its probably going to leave an actual scar! It sure did \\&quot;free my skin\\&quot;... Right from my body! My legs are on fire and now that I&#x27;m all dried off I have some pretty hideous razor burn, despite what the product description says.Worst hair removal purchase I have ever made. Wish I could take it back and buy disposables instead. See my fabulous shave in the attached photos.    ***Edit***  I received a letter and package from Energizer Personal Care with a return envelope for the razor to send it in for quality testing. They also sent adequate compensation in the form of coupons for another Schick product that I have previously used to great satisfaction. I did not feel it fair to leave a bad review without making mention of their fabulous customer service and dedication to making their quality better and better.</li>
    <li> This thing works very good if you don&#x27;t press too hard. My first time using it I pressed just a little too hard on my leg and cut myself up, so yes it can still cut you. Just use very light strokes and it works perfectly. I&#x27;m almost 7 months pregnant so for me this was a good purchase, I didn&#x27;t want to cut myself up now that I can&#x27;t see anything! Just shave lightly and exfoliate before you do shave.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Received it before date expected.</li>
    <li> I just got it because i had a replacement i wanted to use, but its ok, nothing different from others</li>
    <li> I searched for this because, I thought they were no longer available.  I really like my razor and wanted to keep using it.  I was happy to locate and use these re-fills.</li>
    <li> Best ever. I manage to cut myself with the others out there, not with this one. Even at hard to shave places. I love it. Was fast delivered great seller</li>
    <li> This razor is highly underrated. I buy refills on Amazon because because they&#x27;re hard to find locally. This razor is great from preventing nicks and cuts. It&#x27;s also a great starter razor for girls just learning to shave their legs. I will continue to purchase refill blades from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the WORST razor I have ever used.  To say that this reduces cuts is just false advertising.  The first time I tried it, I cut my legs multiple times (worse than I have ever cut my legs shaving).  At first I thought, &amp;#34;OK, maybe I was using too much pressure or something&amp;#34;.  So the next time I used it I tried to be more gentle and not press down as hard.  Well, then it was the worst shave ever because is didn&#x27;t actually remove my hair completely.  I dread shaving with this thing, but I&#x27;m cheap and I don&#x27;t want to just throw it out.  I thought at first that I was the problem, like there&#x27;s a special way to use this kind of razor.  However the more I use it the more I just hate it.  Once this thing dies, I will be going back to Venus razors.  It&#x27;s worth the extra money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> No problems. Item as advertised, fast delivery.</li>
