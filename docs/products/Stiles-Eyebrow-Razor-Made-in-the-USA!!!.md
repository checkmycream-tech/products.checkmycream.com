<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the tiny size heads for shaping eyebrows.  Because of my eyesight I can&#x27;t see to use tweezers and these do the trick.  I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> theses are the greatest...work like a charm!!! Thanks for the other reviews because they are why I purchased this item and so very glad I did. I&#x27;m giving one to my daughter and another to a friend. Please keep making these, as I will be buying them again.</li>
    <li> Very small, but perfect for eyebrows!  I would be nice if they had a cover for the blade.  Not sure if they can be used more than once, tho...we shall see, next week.</li>
    <li> These little razors are just perfect for eyebrows even tho they are a bit expensive . I really do like them much better than any others that I have used before .</li>
    <li> Love these little razors. Easy to do the curve in your eyebrows.  Hard to find in the stores. Good price on Amazon.!</li>
    <li> I used to find these at a local beauty supply store, but they stopped carrying them. I was glad to find these on Amazon, and they are cheaper than what I used to pay, even with the shipping charge. These are shaped like a real razor, and work so much better than the flat ones.</li>
    <li> Wife loves these things</li>
    <li> Such a handy tool for shaping eyebrows.</li>
    <li> My wife keeps buying these little things. She loves them for trimming eyebrows for her and my daughter. I can&#x27;t really give it a thumbs up from personal experience though. She tried to trim my eyebrows until I explained that I&#x27;m a man, and facial hair is manly.</li>
    <li> I love these. I was skeptical using a razor (I had once heard never to use a razor) until I used these and that was over a year ago and I haven&#x27;t plucked since. It is pain free and FAST so that I have better looking eyebrows much more often then when I tweezed. I have seem some razors that look like small butter knives, who would want to put that up by your eye? The razor is teeny tiny and I have no trouble with it. Every women should know about these, these rank next to sliced bread and the electric washing machine as worlds best inventions! Best, easiest eyebrows ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eyebrow razors after Walmart stopped selling these, and they went in the trash! There was too much plastic around the razor and I couldn&#x27;t tell how much I was really getting ready to shave off my eyes! Yes, disaster ensued one time. UGH! These razors are perfect!! The handle is perfect to hold and maintain control and very little plastic around the blade, so you know exactly where you&#x27;ll be removing hair! I love that they are shaped like a regular disposable razor. Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling these! I wish there were more stars, because these are a perfect 10!</li>
    <li> I bought these razors years ago at WalMart and have been looking for them in stores ever since. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Only 4 stars because they are so expensive</li>
    <li> I dont have a lot of time so tweezing isnt an option. These work great for someone on the go.They last a good while too which is good because they are slightly pricey.  Edit: I bought these again and i still love them. There is little risk of cutting yourself and they are good for travel!</li>
    <li> they are the best!!if you don&#x27;t like getting waxed then get these!!they work so well and you can arch do almost anything!!!</li>
    <li> I am in my upper sixties and can&#x27;t pluck my fine eyebrows any longer. These make it so easy to keep them neat, I&#x27;ve tried waxing and it took off my skin as it&#x27;s become thin as I age. Cream doesn&#x27;t appeal to me with the chemical issue and it usually burns and leaves me red and so irritated. These are the perfect shape to do the job and I can leave my glasses on so I can see what I&#x27;m doing. I hope they keep making these for a long time!</li>
    <li> Stiles eyebrow razor    These tiny  razors are perfect for removing ear hair in old curmudgeons and shaping eyebrows yet can&#x27;t   be found in any store that claims they sell them.  Got excellent service through Amazon after a rather nasty episode  ordering them from the UK. Don&#x27;t ask!!!    Birdie Stacey</li>
    <li> Great razor!Perfect size to keep a clean arch in my brows.Gave some to a friend.She loved them as well!</li>
    <li> I hate waxing! These little razors are PERFECT. My only complaint is that you cannot find them in stores. TIP: Take care of the blade. Clean out after each use (even if you have to use a needle to dig out hair under the razor). And dry after each use. This will help prolong the life of the razor. If you don&#x27;t do these things, it wears out fast.  The small blade allows for precision shaving. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> These are great for multiple uses.</li>
    <li> These are the best razors out there for facial hair and eyebrows!!! They do not last very long, but that is the only downfall. I normally buy 3 packages a year. I hope they never stop making them because its the only one I use!!</li>
    <li> I love how easy these shape my brows.  I&#x27;ll always keep them on hand!!!!</li>
    <li> These are a must have but I wish they were more cost effective</li>
    <li> They are by far the best, no more waxing, no more plucking, its great for contouring, love it</li>
    <li> the head is very small and easy to remove the hair in delicate areas around the eye.  Unfortunately, the blade does not last a very long time, After 1 or 2 uses, it becomes dull and does not remove the hair any longer.</li>
    <li> I love the ease and convienence of these small razors. Perfect for the eyebrow. Looks like I have had them professionally done.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Easy to use and it works. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because one of the six blades in my pack was dull.</li>
    <li> I was blessed with thick eyebrows. Stiles tiny razor is the only thing that works and it is very gentle on the delicate eye area. Plus it is less pain free a great alternative to waxing!</li>
    <li> These little razors make shaping and thinning out of eyebrows painless. If you wait until your eyebrows become a crop each time, then you won&#x27;t get as many cuttings off the little blade but if you keep on top of the crop on a daily routine then your little razor will cultivate more times one one blade. Just not always easy to find them.</li>
    <li> These little razors are great for around the eyebrows and hard to get places. They only last for a couple or so uses.</li>
    <li> Once my local stores stopped carryed the stiles razors in stock, i couldnt remember what the brand was called. i am so happy to now have overstock of these awesome razors. not only do they make my eyebrows look fabulous, i dont have to mess with them daily.. the blade cuts the hair super close and they look awesome!!! THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> great little tool you don&#x27;t want to be without!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years, absolute favorite way to trim my thick eyebrows. The heads are super tiny so they&#x27;re perfect for shaping curves into your eyebrows with precision or tackling a unibrow. They&#x27;re also incredibly sharp! I&#x27;ve accidentally sliced the ends off my hair and nicked myself with these before, so be cautious when using them, especially when they&#x27;re brand new. I get a lot of compliments on how good my eyebrows look after I use these all the time!</li>
    <li> The razors seem pricey but they&#x27;re totally worth it. I use them to completely shape my eyebrows and then i go in with tweezers and pluck the left over stubs (there aren&#x27;t a ton) so that i can maintain the perfect shape for longer. I get even better results than paying to get my eyebrows waxed but its painless, much cheaper, and quicker. For the amount of razors included in the pack they aren&#x27;t even that much more expensive than the cheap brands.</li>
    <li> Most eyebrow razors are longer length and the razor is on the side.  Because of the shorter width of the razor and the way the handle is situated you can get into smaller areas of the eyebrow without risking taking off too much. I used to be able to buy these at the drug or discount store but lately they have been hard to find.  I was happy to find them on Amazon for such a good price.  They will last a long time if you dry them off after using and put them someplace where the razor is protected and won&#x27;t hit up against other items.</li>
    <li> Sharp and great item. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at Walmart to tame my unruly eyebrows, but they&#x27;ve stopped selling them. Imagine my relief when I finally found them on Amazon! These are the absolute perfect size, and the blade is sharp enough to remove hair but protected enough that I haven&#x27;t cut myself once in over two years of daily use. My only issue with these is the price: for as small as they are, they can&#x27;t possibly be this expensive to manufacture!</li>
    <li> I disliked this product. Its made poorly, the blades are weird and inconsistent between the different units. Im sticking to sephora, Revlon or Walgreens blades!</li>
    <li> Great product and the seller included eyebrow gel as a freebie to make shaving easier. Shaves smoothly with no nicks. Almost as good as a salon.</li>
    <li> This product worked extremely well for me.  It was small, slim, and very manipulative for facial use. The razor did not irritate my skin. I will definitely use this product again. I hope this product has continued availability.</li>
    <li> I love these eyebrow razors. Its hard to try to find these in the stores any more. I tried to find these in Wal Mart, Target, Wal Greens, etc.  when we were home visiting family from Germany. We are a military family so we are overseas. Some of the other eyebrow razors I have used in the past, they just dont work as well as these. These are the perfect size and shape to get into the eyebrow area to get those little stray hairs or the little fine hairs that you cant see. The only problem I had was the price. The seller was very pricey. But, I had no choice but to order these since I cant find these any where else. I am certain that if the seller was to lower their price, I would definitely order more of them at a time. Also wasnt able to track these items on line. Wish the seller gave me a way to track my package. But, my package arrived well ahead of when they said it would arrive.</li>
    <li> Its very handy and easy to carry along, My mom loved it soooo much that I ordered 6 packs of these again. Absolutely love them. Hope they have free shipping and with a bit low price. I am giving it 4/5 because of the same reasons - little pricey &amp; no free shipping.</li>
    <li> I use this razor to keep around the brows neat. Wish they were a little sharper, but they are the only ones I have found that are small enough for the job.</li>
    <li> I love these little razors! I often get peels on my face and not really allowed to wax my eyebrows due to sensitive thin skin after, so I use these to shape and define my eyebrows. They are perfect! Shaves great and get many uses out of them.</li>
    <li> Small enough for great groomed eyebrows. I will actually be purchasing more since they are really great, although they get dull in about 2 or 3 weeks but with 6 razors, I have had plenty. The colors help as well if you want to specifically assign a few for other areas and some for your eyebrows</li>
    <li> first off I am cautious buying N using razors for my eyebrows or face.  I always think they will brow back stubby And black. I have black hair so my eye brows I have to pluck daily.  The first time I tried these I was in love. Looks like I plucked them and only took seconds. Im mad I have gone so long without ever trying these. I&#x27;ll never pluck again. And my skin is so smooth!  Great for the peach fuzz in your face, toes, ankles, and much more. I have sensitive skin and never have gotten razor burn and I don&#x27;t use creams. I dry shave even using them. My sister have both got hooked on these and I&#x27;m about to give some to my brother. You will be amazed!!!!! Def worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> perfect! Order from here whenever we run out!</li>
    <li> I used to comb through Walmart hoping to find these. They are the best for in between waxing. I got tired of looking for them every time I went shopping and found them here. I have given a couple of them away and they love them, too. I am so happy I found them here!!!</li>
    <li> difficult to use....and not as sharp...i had to go over the same spot several times which left my skin a bit irritated. not purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Tiny razor is perfect for &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; touch-up for eyebrows...small enough to shape/sculpt under and between, in those hard-to-reach areas. Great item to keep in make-up and travel bag!</li>
    <li> This product rocks!!  And, because of some packaging changes they doubled my order for nothing!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for these razors for quite some time.  I found them locally once, but I could not ever find them again.  I was so surprised and happy when I found them at Amazon!  They are very narrow which makes it very easy to shape and taper the brows exactly how you want them.  I was also very happy with the amount of time it took to get them.  Considering that they traveled across the country, it only took a couple of days to get them.</li>
    <li> These razors are okay but they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for years, and love them. They are just the right size for my eyebrows. I&#x27;m glad I found them here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found these little razors again! I bought them once and it was impossible to find them again. I am a 60+ with sensitive skin; waxing and threading are out. These are well-shaped and small so you can direct where they shave. The long, straight ones sold in stores are difficult to manage and tend to cut everything in sight--meaning you need to have serious control over them. I lost some unintended eyebrow and lashes first time out and by the second time just tossed them. I&#x27;m buying a couple of packs of these and hoping Amazon never stops selling them.</li>
    <li> These are a must have for any woman that needs to do a quick touch up between eye brow waxing. They last a while and stay sharp. Works great on nose hair as well.</li>
    <li> I believe these are the best eyebrow razors out there. They are easily managable and last a while so the price of the 6 pack is totally worth it. The shipping was super fast too. I ordered them in the middle of the week and received them the following Monday.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eyebrow razors (I am in the process of getting electrolysis so I am not able to tweeze the stray hairs in between sessions) - they have all either been too wide for me to feel confident I wouldn&#x27;t shave off more of my eyebrow than intended, or else the blades are not sharp enough/have stupid guards that make them ineffective.  This is the smallest one I have ever seen, and the sharpness of the blade is just right for me.  I am able to easily clean up stray hairs without any irritation.</li>
    <li> This is great for a quick eyebrow clean up.  Very small.  Had hunted for something like this in stores and never found.  A super product.</li>
    <li> This are wonderful!  Do what they are suppose to do, last a long time.  They are the smallest razors I have found and are very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for and I like these tiny razors.  I&#x27;ve had them before and they are good to use on eyebrows for the touchups one needs. I will get them again.</li>
    <li> so easy to use and no pain plucking or waxing the eye brows.  I got so excited to see Amazon had these when Walmart got rid of them.</li>
    <li> I bought these at WalMart in a pack of two on a whim... I never had a real issue with tweezing or anything or even paying a salon to wax... but these guys are sooooooo easy! I &lt;3 these things. They are super simple to use and the end result is pretty perfect. I&#x27;ve tried to use similar things but it never quite worked out. I wish more people knew about these (maybe they&#x27;d be carried by Amazon then so I could get them on auto delivery! I would!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, don&#x27;t hesitate! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> These razors are not sharp. They did not shave the eyebrows properly and left many stranded eyebrows. I thought these were like another one I bought a few years ago, that worked great, but they are different. sorry</li>
    <li> My smoken hot wife likes them and uses them all the time. She would buy them locally if she could find them, but no one carries them.</li>
    <li> I love Stiles Eyebrow Razor! plucking unwanted hair was so painful before, but not with Stiles! I reccommend anyone try this great product. I never want to go back to tweezers again.</li>
    <li> Like these. They are nice and tiny for nose area.</li>
    <li> These are nice for cleaning up eyebrows in a hurry.</li>
    <li> The blade area is very small so it&#x27;s great to clean up around your brows.  Just be careful - they do cut easily.  This 6 pack will probably last me a lifetime!</li>
    <li> I thought these would be easier to use due to the pos reviews.  After cutting and irritating sensitive areas of my face was a learning curve.  IF you hold the razor a the right angle and DO NOT apply a lot of pressure, they will work fine.  Even though i look like the cat had his way with my face, i still like them.  They are super small for nose, lip, brows tweaking.  Just have some zinc oxide at hand for razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck.</li>
    <li> These are terrible! I bought a pack of them because the reviews were so positive but they dulled after one use and didn&#x27;t even work all that well. It says to cut with the grain so I did and it didn&#x27;t cut the hairs at all so I go against the grade and it worked a tad bit but not worth the hefty price or the possible cuts to my skin.  I would rather use my tweezers or a full sized razor. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Btw I have thin blonde hair that normally cut very easily.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ORDERED THESE RAZORS SEVERAL TIMES AND WILL BE ORDERING THEM FOR AS LONG AS THEY&#x27;RE AVAILABLE. THEY&#x27;RE GREAT LITTLE &amp;#34;TOUCH-UP&amp;#34; TOOLS AND I&#x27;VE NOT EVER HAD ONE SECOND OF PROBLEMS WITH THE COMPANY. YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY ORDERING THESE. PRICED A BIT ON THE HIGH SIDE, BUT THEY&#x27;RE MORE THAN WORTH IT.</li>
    <li> These little gizmos are the greatest.  I use them for touch ups and for the area just above my nose and between my eyes - spots that are consistently missed when I get waxed or threaded.</li>
    <li> Every woman needs these razors!!! Love them.</li>
    <li> Never could find these in stores after the initial pack......tried EVERY other brand of these and nothing even comes remotely close to working as well as these little suckers.  PLEASE whoever makes these don&#x27;t ever close up shop!</li>
    <li> I bought these to trim around the inside of a goatee, but they are pretty much on the dull side.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much so I was not that disappointed.  They kind of work OK but I still have 5 of the six, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter can&#x27;t live without these and can&#x27;t find them in the stores lately:(</li>
    <li> I have tired numerous eyebrow planers or trimmers.  I have very thin, light eyebrow hair that is nearly impossible to tweeze.  I am very allergic to the dissolving creams.  I tried waxing once and my eyebrows were burned for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were recommended after purchasing a different product, and in the quest for a good one I ordered these too. I love them!  They produce a clean edge and get all of the thin hairs trimmed perfectly.  I use them every day to keep everything looking smooth, since they do not pluck hair out, it shows up again in 24 hours.  I find the blades last 1-2 weeks.  Be careful when first using because the blade is sharp and I have been cut more than once.  There really is nothing else like these on the market!</li>
    <li> LOve these!  My only complaint is they get dull after only a couple of uses</li>
    <li> Love these! Started using these years ago. So easy. I put a little lotion on the area of unwanted stray eyebrows, and off they go! So much faster, with less pain than waxing and economical. I use the little razor over &amp; over. My granddaughter is 9, and has a unibrow, (thanks to her father). Now we just shape them up in a minute! No painful plucking or waxing!</li>
    <li> Love the way it works on my brows. Wish they lasted longer.</li>
    <li> These razors are tiny, have NO caps and extremely sharp.  They cut facial skin very very easy.  My skin is very soft and these cut me sooo bad I threw them out BE VERY CAREFUL THE FIRST TIME YOU USE THEM , They are 100 times sharper then you would ever expect for this tiny face slicer</li>
    <li> This product is the best eyebrow razor ever. None compare to this. I use it on my teenagers who find plucking and waxing very painful. With this product there is none of that. The only thing I have to say that is strange is, in the multi packs some of the razors don&#x27;t work or are dull not sure which it is, and they will not work. This makes it an expensive product but well worth it for my kids.</li>
    <li> stiles eyebrow razor is a great way to get a clean and precise under eyebrow line...love it..i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Really disappointed.  I was really looking forward to trying these based on my previous usage of mini blades which is awesome.  I always loved how clean the brow line would look.  I am giving it one extra star because I really like the small diameter of the blade which allows precise shaping.  But boy is this blade dull.  No wonder you have to buy 6 at once because you will run out in no time with just a couple.  The best brand I have tried is by Ardell. Their blades are corrugated and they last over multiple uses.  The diameter  is a little wider but that is trumped by the blade&#x27;s sharpness and durability.  I will try to return these. Certainly not worth $17!</li>
    <li> These razors are awesome! Wish they were not so expensive but there&#x27;s no competitive product that has excellent results. I&#x27;m also able to get rid of unwanted facial hair above the lip with these razors. These are girls best friend!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a mother of two so i don&#x27;t have the time or energy to groom like i used to, i love these things, i can make it look like i plucked in about 20 seconds. of course the hair grows back faster than when you pluck or wax but its better than leaving the house with crazy brows because i didn&#x27;t have time to do it eairlier.</li>
    <li> These really are fantastic. I look like I came from the salon on a regular basis.</li>
