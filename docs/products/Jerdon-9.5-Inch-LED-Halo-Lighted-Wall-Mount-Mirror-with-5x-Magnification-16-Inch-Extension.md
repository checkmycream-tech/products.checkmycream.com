      <li>good luck</li>
      <li>Very glad I talked  myself into it.  </li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;you need a drill too and someone very skilled with DYI</li>
      <li>We just love it!</li>

      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great purchase, one of the best I have made this year!</li>
      <li>, as others have stated, the LED light is not that bright.</li>
      <li>Now obviously, it won&#x27;t be light flood lights on your face, but give a nice &#x27;halo&#x27; kind of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overnight guests love it too.</li>
      <li>bought more screws and installed it for</li>
      <li>This mirror is perfect for me and wife&#x27;s makeup, with the correct amount of magnification necessary.</li>
      <li>We went on vacation and had one of these mirrors in the bathroom, and I fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>the ones in the hotels have a greater magnifying element.  </li>
      <li>I was able to install myself.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I had quotes up to 1200 dollars and can&#x27;t imagine how they could be any better than this mirror.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Debated on whether lighted or not, and am glad I chose lighted.</li>
      <li>it seems okay.</li>
      <li>So far, so good, though!</li>
      <li>Happy to have found a decent LED-based model, as I read</li>
      <li>E-Z Self-Drilling Drywall Anchor (100 per Box)]]; three on the top, and one on the bottom) to secure the removable mounting plate.</li>
      <li>--I&#x27;d say it is kinda nice, but not overly useful.  </li>
      <li>It is well made and the instructions were easy.</li>
      <li>My husband installed it in our main bathroom, one that is not as brightly lit as it should be.</li>
      <li>Easy to install</li>
      <li>Easy mount on wall with plug.  </li>
      <li>my SO is super skilled and went to Lowes</li>
      <li>Nice large size.  </li>
      <li>It looks great and can be adjusted to several positions.  </li>
      <li>it looks cheap.</li>
      <li>the diameter including the light ring is 8 3/4.</li>
      <li>Fantastic mirror.  </li>
      <li>I would not go out of your way to have the light</li>
      <li>Light ring simulates daylight for makeup, and coiled plug stays out of the way.</li>
      <li>It might help eliminate a bit of shadow, but IS NOT the primary light source to use with the mirror.  </li>
      <li>LED light probably provides equivalent of a 4-7 watt incandescent night light.  </li>
      <li>I wish the light was brighter.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have a wall stud in the right place make sure you use substantial anchors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A good old fashion toggle would be nice for older fingers.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>This would have been more of a melding of different designs for this kind of product.</li>
      <li>It mounts solidly and has good magnification.</li>
      <li>The LED light is just the right amount of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The basic mirror and overall quality is excellent, however.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the overall construction quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as described, solid construction, nice finish, light is just the right amount of brightness needed.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey, but seems to be worth it since it is well constructed.  </li>
      <li>I find the LED&#x27;s bright enough to get a good shave without missing spots!</li>
      <li>It mounted easily on the wall and seems secure enough.</li>
      <li>Lightning is about half as bright as I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I mounted the mirror quickly (about 10 mins) and easily using four, medium METAL drywall anchors (like these [[ASIN:B002WGJSRQ Red Head</li>
      <li>We have been using this product for only a couple of weeks, so I&#x27;ll be sure to makesubsequent posts IF I find that the product&#x27;s quality doesn&#x27;t meet muster.</li>
      <li>This mirror was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>The steel backing only leaves room for screw heads at the top and bottom on the mounting plate.</li>
      <li>The x5 magnification is more than enough.  </li>
      <li>Had they gone with higher output LEDs in the unit</li>
      <li>Also looked at 10x and 5x, decided on 5x, which is perfect, just enough magnification but not so much that you only have a small area to be able to focus on your face.  </li>
      <li>to install, nice clear cord and led lighting last forever.&lt;br /&gt;Nickel finish doesn&#x27;t leave finger prints</li>
      <li>The LED ring of light is consistent and white.</li>
      <li>it has a standard AC power cord (coiled) that will easily reach nearby outlets.</li>
      <li>Too strong will have you totally out of focus...</li>
      <li>so needs to be hung on a stud and with large anchors.  </li>
      <li>It is a clean neutral white and light very evenly lit, but it could have used a little more brightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is only 5x as stated in the fine print.</li>
      <li>the screws in the box did NOT work and left a huge hole in my wall</li>
      <li>I really like the mirror and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>The mirror is made very well.</li>
      <li>However, seems that you would not want it much brighter than is since it would cause glare.  </li>
      <li>It has the brushed nickel finish and a LED light.  </li>
      <li>She really likes this setup!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>The hinges and mechanisms that allow the mirror to pull out from the wall and angle are made very well.</li>
      <li>As others have mentioned, this is a very well made mirror.</li>

    <li> Still works great...but wish it was brighter!!  Nice large size.  Easy mount on wall with plug.  How do women manage without one of these once they need a bifocal prescription!!Check out what magnification works best for you beforehand in a &amp;#34;store&amp;#34;.  Too strong will have you totally out of focus...to weak will have you squinting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a +3 on my bifocal...and this works well for me.</li>
    <li> We saw another model Jerdon mirror in a hotel room. My wife let me know she REALLY liked it. I noted the particulars. Of course, Amazon had that, plus a bunch of options. I ordered it, installed it, and she loves it! The LED ring of light is consistent and white. The adjustability is great. Great quality, and made in America. Now, she puts on her face each morning in supreme close-up glory!</li>
    <li> Over all a good product.  Be sure to place it at a height that will work best for you because the up-down tilt angle is limited to about 22 degrees up or down.</li>
    <li> Fantastic mirror.  Initially put off by reviewers who thought the light was too dim.  However, seems that you would not want it much brighter than is since it would cause glare.  Redid our bath with light fixtures not very bright and I need to see when shaving (old eyes).  This mirror is perfect for me and wife&#x27;s makeup, with the correct amount of magnification necessary.</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to install and the wife loves it. Happy wife, happy life.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing product.  It&#x27;s way too heavy to even think about hanging on the wall.  Too heavy even for it&#x27;s own arms.  Not flexible enough as far as which direction it can be moved when mounted.  Most unhappy with having to pay $4.98 shipping to return the product when it was an Amazon Prime purchase!</li>
    <li> My only negative comment is that the description and the box both said it was 1X and 5X magnification. Since it does not have a mirror on both sides it obviously is not. Other than that I really like it. The biggest selling point was that it was LED.</li>
    <li> 5x magnification didn&#x27;t cut it for us. Had to return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this item since December 2014. My husband installed it in our main bathroom, one that is not as brightly lit as it should be. This has proven to be a great purchase--bright, good magnification, sturdy. It gets a lot of use even though it is not in our master bath. Overnight guests love it too.</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;re over seventy, this is a must to see all the hairs you missed when you thought you did a good job shaving.</li>
    <li> This mirror has LED lighting and is much brighter than the other mirror I had. This one has only the magnification mirror as I found I didn&#x27;t use the regular mirror on my old one.  It is heavy so needs to be hung on a stud and with large anchors.  I really like the mirror and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had quotes up to 1200 dollars and can&#x27;t imagine how they could be any better than this mirror.  Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Installation:  Comes with a removable plate that unscrews from the back.  This plate has a circular and linear screw system that is used to put your own screws into the wall.  Mount the plate onto the wall, mount your mirror onto the plate.  Comes with a semi clear power cord about 2ft long but is coiled so it can extend further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:  A single small knob is used to turn the switch for the light on.  The LED&#x27;s aren&#x27;t bright for a reason.  If they were any brighter you&#x27;d be blinded by the light and unable to see yourself in the mirror.  The x5 magnification is more than enough.  You can see every little hair and pore on your face at that magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars as another 1x mirror on the back would have been nice.  This would have been more of a melding of different designs for this kind of product.</li>
    <li> I saw this mirror in a hotel bathroom and I had to have it!  It&#x27;s exactly as described, solid construction, nice finish, light is just the right amount of brightness needed.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is I purchased this less than a week ago (it arrived yesterday) for $88.00, only to see it went on sale for $79.00 shortly after my purchase.  I wish I had known it was going on sale because I would have waited.</li>
    <li> Note that the picture of the packaging box on the website and the delivered box are identical but both clearly state that this unit has 1* and 5* magnification.  This is incorrect, it only has 5* magnification.</li>
    <li> I was able to install myself. I use it everyday. It is highly functional and sturdy. The bulb lasts a very long time. I have not yet had to replace it.</li>
    <li> It looks good and is well made with two exceptions&lt;br /&gt;1. the switch feels cheap and is harder than it should be to turn. A good old fashion toggle would be nice for older fingers.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s heavy and at full extension, puts a lot on the mounting plate. The steel backing only leaves room for screw heads at the top and bottom on the mounting plate. If you don&#x27;t have a wall stud in the right place make sure you use substantial anchors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to be 9.5 inches but the mirror portion is only 7 1/8 and the diameter including the light ring is 8 3/4. It 9 3/4 with the metal rim. So a new measure is need for the Chinese maker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Careful, the picture of the box it comes in says 1x and 5x magnification. It is only 5x as stated in the fine print.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the poor reviews in these mirrors. This thing was heavy and well constructed. Extender as have adjustable tension screws. Light ring simulates daylight for makeup, and coiled plug stays out of the way. It was heavy enough that I decided to screw it into a stud rather than use the drywall anchors that it came with.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it was advertised as 1x and 5x magnification thinking that it was somehow adjustable like many other mirrors of this type. Wrong! When they say single-sided - they mean it. The magnification is achieved by actually positioning the mirror toward you or away from you. The quality appears to be good, but I found it useless. I purchased this in October when I was building a house and did not open it to have it installed until now and, of course, the return policy time frame has expired. Bummer for me.</li>
    <li> the mirror is great I love it&lt;br /&gt;however unless you or your installer is not a handy man good luck the screws in the box did NOT work and left a huge hole in my wall&lt;br /&gt;fortunately my SO is super skilled and went to Lowes bought more screws and installed it for me.&lt;br /&gt;you need a drill too and someone very skilled with DYI</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the overall construction quality. The arms and pivot joints feel well-made. Happy to have found a decent LED-based model, as I read the others have had issues with CCFL lighted models failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am taking one star away for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the mirror has a very limited up/down swivel ability. In other words, you MUST mount this unit at the exact level height of whom is going to use it, adversely taller individuals like me need to crouch down in order to look into it – aka it’s not multi-height friendly.&lt;br /&gt;Second, as others have stated, the LED light is not that bright. It is a clean neutral white and light very evenly lit, but it could have used a little more brightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes : it has a standard AC power cord (coiled) that will easily reach nearby outlets. However (although I recognize this modification not an approved option), I removed this cord since it was connected by wire-nuts inside the mounting base, thus I opted to hardwire it to a existing wall fixture receptacle for an even cleaner install look.</li>
    <li> This version plugs into a regular outlet and doesn&#x27;t require wiring, but does require knowledge of securely mounting this mirror.</li>
    <li> Excellent function and construction.  LED light probably provides equivalent of a 4-7 watt incandescent night light.  It might help eliminate a bit of shadow, but IS NOT the primary light source to use with the mirror.  I would not go out of your way to have the light--I&#x27;d say it is kinda nice, but not overly useful.  The basic mirror and overall quality is excellent, however.</li>
    <li> i sent this back because it says that it&#x27;s like the ones in the hotel.  but it&#x27;s not.  the ones in the hotels have a greater magnifying element.  this one is only 5, which as it turns out isn&#x27;t anywhere near how it is in the hotel mirrors.  other than that it seems okay.</li>
    <li> Good quality and works great!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install, nice clear cord and led lighting last forever.&lt;br /&gt;Nickel finish doesn&#x27;t leave finger prints</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife after she used one in a hotel.  The 5X maginifaction is just right for a big mirror.  She also has a small one with much higher magnification.  Lighting is also very helpful, and provideds even illumination.  It is a bit pricey, but seems to be worth it since it is well constructed.  It is relativley heavy and I used No. 8 screws to secure it to a stud behind the wall.  The photo does not show the &amp;#34;curly cue&amp;#34; cord.  Oringinally was going to shorten the cord but the coiled feature made that unnecessary.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it and it&#x27;s an upscale addition to our master bath.  It is well made and the instructions were easy.</li>
    <li> Very nice finish and movement.  Good mirror too.  Too bad the LED lighting is so dim. Lightning is about half as bright as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Very glad I talked  myself into it.  We went on vacation and had one of these mirrors in the bathroom, and I fell in love with it.  Came home and started looking for one. I am nearsighted, so putting on eye makeup can be very tricky, since I can&#x27;t see up close without my glasses, and you can&#x27;t put on eye makeup wearing glasses.  So this is the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debated on whether lighted or not, and am glad I chose lighted. It&#x27;s not a bright light, which is okay, just enough to illuminate your face.  Also looked at 10x and 5x, decided on 5x, which is perfect, just enough magnification but not so much that you only have a small area to be able to focus on your face.  It mounted easily on the wall and seems secure enough. Overall, it&#x27;s a great purchase, one of the best I have made this year!</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror. I find the LED&#x27;s bright enough to get a good shave without missing spots! My wife loves it too. I only paid $42 open box price on Amazon. It was a steal. The whole mirror is well built and and expensive looking. The wall cord is small, clear and not to noticeable when it&#x27;s plugged in. We just love it!</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned, this is a very well made mirror. It mounts solidly and has good magnification. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but the LED ring light is a little weak. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s unusable, just dim. Had they gone with higher output LEDs in the unit Jerdon would have knocked it out of the park.</li>
    <li> The extension arm is not long enough. The mirror is magnify only. I wish the light was brighter. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the magnification was not adjustable.  It only had the 5X magnification so I returned it without any issue.</li>
    <li> My father purchased this for my wife&#x27;s birthday at my suggestion. After checking EVERY other model online and on Amazon, and reading all the reviews, I selected this one because it is 9.5\\&quot;, has 5x magnification, has LED lighting, and plugs into a regular electrical outlet. When my wife opened it, she was a little surprised, as she does use much makeup and didn&#x27;t think she needed one. She was also unsure that she would like the magnification. However, after I installed it for her, she loves it! I mounted the mirror front, left-side of a large mirror in the back of the second vanity sink outside of the master bathroom in our bedroom. The vanity mirror isn&#x27;t magnified, so I decided that didn&#x27;t need to buy a mirror with multiple sides (one having no magnification), or a 10x spot magnifier embedded in the main mirror. That simplified the selection process. I mounted the mirror quickly (about 10 mins) and easily using four, medium METAL drywall anchors (like these [[ASIN:B002WGJSRQ Red Head EZ-100 E-Z Self-Drilling Drywall Anchor (100 per Box)]]; three on the top, and one on the bottom) to secure the removable mounting plate. NOTE: the mounting plate has lots of universal slots, so you can easily use several drywall anchors to mount the mirror, and you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about mounting to wall stud (although it&#x27;s recommended). The mirror&#x27;s mounting arm is solidly constructed, operates smoothly, and has multiple tightening and adjustment features. So, when my wife wants to do her makeup now, she simply swings the mirror out into position, angles the mirror down a bit, and turns on the light. She checks herself and her clothes in the main vanity mirror. She really likes this setup!&lt;br /&gt;One last word: the finish of the HL1016NL is nickel, but it appears to have a poly-plastic coating that would inhibit corrosion/spotting in high bathroom humidity, and protects the finish when cleaning. We have been using this product for only a couple of weeks, so I&#x27;ll be sure to makesubsequent posts IF I find that the product&#x27;s quality doesn&#x27;t meet muster. So far, so good, though! Not a bit of buyer&#x27;s-remorse as yet....</li>
    <li> This mirror was exactly what I was looking for.  It has the brushed nickel finish and a LED light.  It looks great and can be adjusted to several positions.  The LED light is just the right amount of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, took less than 10 minutes to install (one of he man reasons I purchased one with a plug rather than one that had to be wired in). I would give 5 stars but I plug hat comes with it looks cheap. All in all great product. Used daily for the last 4 months without any issues.</li>
    <li> Thought we were getting a wall mount unit that wired directly.  but it came with cord and we&#x27;ll have a hole in base.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s big. And bright. I was skeptical after I read other reviews saying the light was not bright, but I was pleasantly surprised when I turned it. It&#x27;s quite bright. Now obviously, it won&#x27;t be light flood lights on your face, but give a nice &#x27;halo&#x27; kind of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction quality is awesome.</li>
    <li> not enough magnification for me.  Jerdon makes an 8x magnification which is perfect.</li>
    <li> We completely remodeled our master bath and this mirror was something my wife really wanted. I mounted this mirror last night and my wife loves it! She on first sight worried it was too big but I held it up to the wall and she pull it out and realized that it was a good size. The mirror is made very well. The hinges and mechanisms that allow the mirror to pull out from the wall and angle are made very well. The best part to me was the way it mounts to the wall. It is very very simple. It comes with two heavy duty drywall anchors since the user will be pushing and pulling the mirror back and forth. There is a metal back plate you use as the template mark your holes place the anchors attach plate with screws. Slide mirror base on and attach two decorative screw caps and you are popping pimples in the lighted and magnified mirror in minutes! I recomend.</li>
