    <li> Love this package! And lasts so long. Makes my hair feel and smell amazing! Can&#x27;t wrong paying this price, when in stores one small bottle costs $25. You get two big bottles, and the treatment for $50 definitely a deal! I recommended it to so many friends!</li>
    <li> Great product price is super although was missing the free 5.1 oz conditioner.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 4 yrs now &amp; will never use anything else....love this stuff!</li>
    <li> By far, the best hair care products I have ever used!!!!  Simply amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for a little over a year. I have very thick, somewhat unmanagable hair and it&#x27;s been a huge help. Lasts over 6 months, too - great value!</li>
    <li> Is awesome!! My hair has never been softer or healthier !!</li>
    <li> I think these therapy products for hair are wonderful, they have been helping my hair to look healthy and shiny</li>
    <li> I see a change in my hair, it has less of a  frizz and the Reconstructor is Amazing----&amp;#62; highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This is the best hair shampoo and conditioner ever!! My hair was not getting the love and care it needed. Then I started using Joico....AWESOME SAUCE!!! After every shower my hair feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Keeps color lasting,  but did not do much for the health of my hair.</li>
    <li> Both of these products are amazing. I first learned about the products from my stylist. She was exactly correct. Color treated hair responds beautifully to these products.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s absolutely one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased for my hair. I strongly recommend this line of products. Go ahead and splurge a little! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all! I have dry natural curly hair &amp; this dried my hair out.</li>
    <li> My hair feels smooth!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Hair feels dry and full of static.  Not sure it is a Joico procduct have used Joico products for over 20 years and not had a problem with Joico before</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best! My wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. Before my hair was so dry from the sun and after using this, my hair so soft but yet still has body. I am glad I bought the big containers which will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended Joico as a periodic switch from my Biolage products.  I noticed that my color stayed livelier longer with it.  My hair is very thick and coarse and the conditioner has tamed that down alot.  I really like the Joica products, and Amazon had a great price on this &amp;#34;package&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set because it was on sell and cheaper then purchasing the shampoo/conditioner And Reconstructor seperate. However i did receive my order and the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; 5.1 oz bottle was not the reconstructor but the &amp;#34;revitoluxe&amp;#34;.  It also did not come as picture in a set but they were all individual bottles and taped.</li>
    <li> I love joico products! They leave my hair amazing feeling! Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how they tapped mine a million times and now the container is sticky but it doesn&#x27;t affect the product so it&#x27;s ok :)</li>
    <li> Just starting to use the product.  So far, so good.  Good supplier, fast shipment.  Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Smell is so-so. The mask was probably the only thing worth the purchase, but it smelled terrible. It left my hair feeling somewhat hydrated, but I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt so good! I&#x27;m always Leary buying products online and not from the hair salon.. But couldn&#x27;t resist the price. My hair is thicker, and the scent smells amazing</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo and conditioner and the reconstructor leaves my hair more soft and controllable than anything I have tried.  Will definitely stick with this product!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I only gave it a 4 because i&#x27;m still experimenting with it. But in all, this product has been helpful!!!! one of the best as a matter of fact!</li>
    <li> Superb product! Has made a huge difference in the way my hair looks!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever, great price!</li>
    <li> It came just as it said it would. The bottles were actually bigger than I thought they would be, but in a good way. I really feel like I got the best deal and price on this package.</li>
    <li> I really like Joico but the shampoo seemed watered down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Joico before and this doesn&#x27;t even seem like the same shampoo and conditioner. Not happy at all with the product</li>
    <li> This product is the bomb! I tell you, in the years I&#x27;ve used this product, never have I ever been disappointed. It brings my hair literally back to life, restores shine and volume and creates an amazing elasticity. Styling my hair is a pleasure!!! You will love it too! I highly recommend it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast service and great on time delivery! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing. In love. Thank uou</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft, the color is vibrant and I love the smell. Great product at a very nice price.</li>
