### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the best cuticle scissors I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Solingen used to be the best in nail cutters.  </li>
      <li>I love them!!!</li>
      <li>I was never so happy.  </li>
      <li>Even so, these are great nippers.</li>
      <li>These work great for me.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m happy to say I now own&lt;br</li>
      <li>: The manufacturer made good on the warranty.  </li>
      <li>A surgical nurse turned me on to them during my intern time at the VA hospital in 1975 and have loved them ever since.</li>
      <li>I have always loved these kinds of cuticle scissors.  </li>
      <li>You get very precise control with these nippers.  </li>
      <li>I just couldn&#x27;t find any in the drug stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found them here.</li>
      <li>but they cannot be used successfully like the old ones.</li>
      <li>These are, hands down, the best cuticle sissors ever.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the new one!  </li>
      <li>These are awesome little cuticle nippers.  </li>
      <li>and they fit the ticket.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic replacement for the ones that TSA took.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;this rare implement!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I should say that my first pair of these nippers broke after using them for many years.  </li>
      <li>original comments:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The result is that they only work well on one side (when the good tip is closest to what I am trying to cut).  </li>
      <li>I finally have my good kind of cuticle scissor&#x27;s back.  </li>
      <li>Completely satisfied, but I would like to have had it sent to Canada, where I live.</li>
      <li>I was willing to pay more for something that I hoped would be of high quality.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>but, worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are not as good of a quality as the ones I was replacing - I had inherited my previous nippers from my grandmother and they were probably manufactured decades ago.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find these in any local stores but are my favorite type of cuticle clippers.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>Be aware that these are not to be used on your fingernails, ever.  </li>
      <li>These are so much easier to use.  </li>
      <li>I should have returned them, but too much time has gone by now.</li>
      <li>Works better than any other nipper.</li>
      <li>Order 2 of these one as a gift other for myself just love the fact that i have no issues with the holding of this item.</li>
      <li>And the fact they are german made is good a little pricey</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my mother who was having trouble finding scissor style nippers locally and she loved it.</li>
      <li>Adequate only.</li>
      <li>These are not like the older pair I lost &amp; was replacing.</li>
      <li>LOVE this little cuticle nipper.  </li>
      <li>These are not available in stores any more</li>
      <li>I mailed in my dented one and they sent me a new one as a replacement.  </li>
      <li>I am hoping they will send me new ones.</li>
      <li>In particular, the metal seems way too soft.  </li>
      <li>Certainly sharper than the last of the Solingen</li>
      <li>These only cut at the very tip.</li>
      <li>I looked all over for a pair like my old ones.  </li>
      <li>I bought several pair and highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>Not very sharp &amp; does not compare to my old Revelon ones.</li>
      <li>My husband broke my old pair of scissors that I had similar to this one.</li>
      <li>chose these because I wanted cuticle nippers with scissor-like handles and was looking for something higher quality than your average cuticle nippers.  </li>
      <li>I have a similar pair that belonged to my mother, so they are probably 100 years old, so I decided I needed a second pair to keep with my travel items.  </li>
      <li>At Target, one can purchase a whole manicure set for less than the price of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are not like the older pair I lost &amp; was replacing. These are very thick &amp; do not fit or cut cuticles well at all. My opinion is not to buy these. I have torn up the sides of fingernails trying to trim my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother who was having trouble finding scissor style nippers locally and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I have always loved these kinds of cuticle scissors.  Suddenly we couldn&#x27;t get them in any of the stores I went to.  And these stores were in Anchorage, Alaska, when I visited there.  So, out of desparation, I got on line and finally found this.  I was never so happy.  I finally have my good kind of cuticle scissor&#x27;s back.  Be aware that these are not to be used on your fingernails, ever.  These are cuticle only.</li>
    <li> These only cut at the very tip. I should have returned them, but too much time has gone by now.</li>
    <li> Order 2 of these one as a gift other for myself just love the fact that i have no issues with the holding of this item. And the fact they are german made is good a little pricey but, worth it.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t figure out how to use those scissor type cuticle clippers.  These are so much easier to use.  I have a similar pair that belonged to my mother, so they are probably 100 years old, so I decided I needed a second pair to keep with my travel items.  I just couldn&#x27;t find any in the drug stores, so I&#x27;m glad to have found them here.</li>
    <li> Fantastic replacement for the ones that TSA took.  These are awesome little cuticle nippers.  Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what else you expect me to say.  I expected no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunno what else to say.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed.  It may look like the ones from 20 years ago but they cannot be used successfully like the old ones. The quality of the metal is not the same. I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> To me, cuticle nippers are a must. There&#x27;s always a pair in my purse, one on my desk, and one floats around the house depending on who&#x27;s used them last.  A surgical nurse turned me on to them during my intern time at the VA hospital in 1975 and have loved them ever since.</li>
    <li> These are not available in stores any more and I have used them for my entire life. I couldn&#x27;t do without them.</li>
    <li> These work great for me. I can&#x27;t find these in any local stores but are my favorite type of cuticle clippers.</li>
    <li> Solingen used to be the best in nail cutters.  I think these Italian made are equal.  Certainly sharper than the last of the Solingen I purchased from you a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied, but I would like to have had it sent to Canada, where I live.</li>
    <li> Billie Wolf is right -- squeeze-type nippers are impossible to use compared to scissor-type nippers.  You get very precise control with these nippers.  If you have fungal-infected nails, soak your nails in white vinegar for ten minutes, and then use these nippers to trim them.  Always get the ones that say Italy on them -- those are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I should say that my first pair of these nippers broke after using them for many years.  I always use them on my nails, and the metal eventually became fatigued, and snapped.  Even so, these are great nippers.</li>
    <li> These are, hands down, the best cuticle sissors ever. I cannot understand the \\&quot;squeeze\\&quot; clippers as they are just a nightmare to use; they are clumbsy and awkward compared to the very precise results you can get with these sissors. I bought several pair and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> the best cuticle scissors I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Update Aug 2014: The manufacturer made good on the warranty.  I mailed in my dented one and they sent me a new one as a replacement.  I am very pleased with the new one!  I&#x27;m increasing my rating to a 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original comments:&lt;br /&gt;I chose these because I wanted cuticle nippers with scissor-like handles and was looking for something higher quality than your average cuticle nippers.  I was willing to pay more for something that I hoped would be of high quality.  At Target, one can purchase a whole manicure set for less than the price of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not as good of a quality as the ones I was replacing - I had inherited my previous nippers from my grandmother and they were probably manufactured decades ago.  In particular, the metal seems way too soft.  When I was initially opening the package, the nippers fell out of the package and onto my tile floor and one of the tips got smashed in.  The result is that they only work well on one side (when the good tip is closest to what I am trying to cut).  The product says it has a lifetime warranty through the manufacturer, simply by mailing them the product.  I am hoping they will send me new ones.</li>
    <li> Handiest manicure implement ever designed.</li>
    <li> Not very sharp &amp; does not compare to my old Revelon ones.</li>
    <li> My husband broke my old pair of scissors that I had similar to this one. I looked all over for a pair like my old ones.  I ordered these and they fit the ticket.  I love them!!!</li>
    <li> This style of cuticle scissors seemed to have disappeared but I&#x27;m happy to say I now own&lt;br /&gt;this rare implement!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> LOVE this little cuticle nipper.  Have always had one or two on hand.  Works better than any other nipper.</li>
    <li> I like the nippers except they are a little too thick and so are hard to handle. I had difficulty getting them close enough to my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Adequate only. Disappointed in quality for the price.</li>
