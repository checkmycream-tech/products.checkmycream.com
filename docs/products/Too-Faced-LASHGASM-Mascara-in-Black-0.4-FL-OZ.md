<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the product and the delivery was fast!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think this is anything special.  i wouldn&#x27;t waste this much money on a mascara again.  not any different than drug store brands.</li>
    <li> I was unsure about purchasing this product, but now I love it! It does not ever clump or goop, and I like the application wand design. My lashes do look remarkably longer and fuller when I use this product. I am convinced that it works, and the results last throughout the duration of the entire day! Concisely, the product stays put. Not to mention, it is easy to wash off as well; you need only warm water and gentle wiping motions to remove, unless you prefer a more formal type of make-up remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Bear in mind, when this product is removed that it slides off the shaft of the eyelash and gives the illusion that your eyelash is effected. Your eyelash is completely intact, and the heavy coating of the mascara is all that sheds. Do not panic :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* One thing I will add regarding the storage of this product is keep it vertical. I keep mine in the box it came in and standing vertical. This might be why my wand never gets unevenly coated with product. Just a thought :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, a question that surfaces frequently is how often should you replace your mascara? The optimal answer is 2-3 months, however, the average consumer probably replaces theirs every 3-6 months instead. With that thought in mind, the clumping of a product will increase dramatically with older product that has been exposed to the elements (air, debris, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word regarding application, the wand is different in design than that of a typical mascara wand (not a standard brush style applicator). Therefore, it would be prudent to consider having a brow brush/comb handy in the event that you prefer to form your lashes more traditionally as you apply, sculpt, and shape. As I stated above, I like the application wand, but this is a product review thus I am attempting to be thorough. Plus the coating starts off rather moist allowing for ample time to shape your lashes before it sets up or solidifies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to that, I never use a curler for my lashes, but the Laura Mercier lash curler is rated highly if anyone is interested plus there are other good brands on the market as well. I suppose it pertains mostly to the results desired or needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are not particularly long or thick. As a result, I was considering a prescription product called Latisse before I found this magnificent and affordable product from Two Faced Cosmetics. Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of April 15, 2012, I have used this product for many months, and I still love it! **As of January 18, 2013, I am still using this product**</li>
    <li> I have used every mascara out there(chanel, clarins, dior, max factor, revlon ect)and this is the best for the price! I cant say enough good things about this mascara! It did take me two days to prefect the lashes (they turned out very clumpy at first)but as long as I take off the excess mascara formula from the brush before I start, they turn out fab. Looks like I have fake eyelashes they get so long and cant beat that price!also Dont be freaked when you wash your mascara off- they are not your lashes coming out! lol kind of scared me at first but it is just the mascara adds so much length and volume that is comes out in chunks. will buy again for sure! excellent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better for way less. The brush is stiff to the point of painfull other then that I would rate it slightly better then average.</li>
    <li> This is my Favorite mascara EVER! my lashes are so long and full looking!</li>
    <li> It came to me already dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy...</li>
    <li> Makes your lashes look so long while still looking natural and the best part no clumping and easy to remove &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The formula is a bit different from the small trial size I used prior to this purchase, but I still like the way the mascara goes on.  Lashes look great...it&#x27;s just a little more difficult to take off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Too Faced mascara fan!  The Lashgasm makes lashes where there appear to not be any!  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Of the... twenty or more mascaras I&#x27;ve tried this is the my favorite. Deep black color, separates well. No clumping, no smudging, no flaking, no faded tips. Clean application, mid-sized brush, volumizing, lengthening, lasts all day and all night.  Gives a relatively heavy application in one coat. Not particularly natural looking, yet not egregious. This mascara is pretty much perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  gives you wonderfully long lashes.  The only issue is that whatever the formula is that makes them so long is also immune to make-up remover.  Once you put it on you are wearing it for days. and yes, like other reviews you do have to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; off the mascara and sometimes you do lose some eyelashes.  That said, I still love it.</li>
    <li> I bought a full sized Lashgasm mascara after getting a deluxe sample at Ulta a few months ago.  I can get great length with this mascara, probably better than any mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  But I notice that it is prone to clumping. The way to apply this mascara is in a zigzag motion along the lashes.  The length truly is show stopping.  It seems to coat the lashes with a fiber - I see little strings when I remove it.  I only give this one 4 stars instead of 5 though because removal is a bit tricky.  It doesn&#x27;t come off easily for me with my makeup remover cloths followed by my Neutrogena oil free face wash.  I have to go through at least two cotton balls of eye makeup remover (these days, it&#x27;s Estee Lauder oil free) to get it off.  I can get good results (although, admittedly, not quite as good) with other mascaras that are easier to use.  I like to use this one when I go out, but it&#x27;s not my go-to daily mascara.</li>
    <li> I had tried countless high end mascara&#x27;s and found that the Too Faced Lash Injection had everything I needed.  Waterproof, held a curl, lengthened, and thickened. Also, the brush was a great size.  Trusting Too Faced, I purchased this mascara thinking it would be just as good.  Nope!  The brush is too small, it was somehow too wet and uncurled my lashes, wasn&#x27;t waterproof so I had raccoon eyes, and it was really disappointed.  After trying it for little over a week, I gave it away.</li>
    <li> Best mascara you can get for full beautiful lashes.  Well, well worth the money, you will not be disappointed.  I love this stuff so much I bought a bunch for gifts for my closest friends.  You will love it!  Their Too Faced Eye shadow is the best too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened but this bottle i received has been pure garbage. It does not even stay on for half the day it&#x27;s dry and very flaky. Overall I didn&#x27;t hate the product but I found it clumped my lashes together.</li>
    <li> I have very short straight eyelashes and as a female I have always wanted long lovely lashes.this mascara is incredible, it is really good at separating my lashes and making them look shockingly long. This mascara works well on its own and is also a great second coat mascara for those of you who like to use more than one mascara at at a time. This is the first product by Too Faced cosmetics that I have tried and it blew me away no wonder  its called LashGasm!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 months and it is just now starting to get thick on me and show a little clumping. It goes on natural and makes my eyelashes really pop!  I really like this one!</li>
    <li> The third party sellers buy cheap old, spoiled makeup and sell at full price! I bought some of this Too Faced mascara and it had a strong odor that made my eyes water the whole time I wore it. Thought I was allergic but I had my makeup teacher look at it and had gone rancid. She said it happens often with amazon. Eyeshadow I have used from amazon is fine because it takes a loooong time for it to go bad. Just FYI!</li>
    <li> It is not bad, but Loreal&#x27;s mascara is just as good. Maybe even better. Nothing to rave about. Just your average mascara...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Too Faced eyeshadows so I tried out this mascara too. I was disappointed enough to return it, which I almost never do with cosmetics. I have to curl my lashes and this is so wet it takes the curl right out. It might work better if you already have nice, curly lashes? I&#x27;ll stick to  Maybelline Colossal for now. It&#x27;s cheaper and a better product for me.</li>
    <li> Although, I do love most Too Faced Cosmetics this didn&#x27;t do the job I wanted it to. I don&#x27;t care when these companies say they are waterproof because they aren&#x27;t. Also, the brush definitely stabbed your eyelids and made it uncomfortable. I think there is a better product out there.</li>
    <li> I normally love this product but the bottle is broken</li>
    <li> After reading all the review I ordered the product ,but I have to say \\&quot;It is not at all what I was expecting \\&quot;I have very long lashes, that mascara is not worth the money ,it works just like the ones you can buy for $6 to $10.</li>
    <li> LOVE this mascara.  I know a few people have mentioned not liking the applicator wand, but I really think it works great. As with ANY mascara, I always gently blot the applicator (especially the very end) on a tissue before applying to my eyelashes, as it removes the excess product instead of making a mess on your eyelids, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara applies well and makes my lashes look long. I might try to, after letting this dry, use a second mascara to give them a little more volume, though. I would really only bother for special occassions, though, as for everyday use this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that even after removing it (I use [[ASIN:B000B9N0OI Mary Kay Oil Free Makeup Remover New Packaging]] ), then washing my face at night, when I get in the shower the next day and the water hits my face, I end up with black under my eyes still. Not a big deal to me, though; just a minor inconvenience that I seem to have with any mascara, even trying different removers.</li>
    <li> I have long, thin lashes. Overall, LashGASM does well to coat each lash with product. I also like the thin wand, as it allows you to have more control and you don&#x27;t end up with mascara all over your eyelid. It stays in place all day and doesn&#x27;t run. The only drawback is I just didn&#x27;t feel it thickened my lashes as much as I would have liked. Overall, though - it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty awesome mascara that both thickens and lengthens lashes--quite noticably--in just one coat. But if you are like me and like to apply multiple coats of mascara, you&#x27;re out of luck because this stuff clumps horribly. Such a shame, because other than that it&#x27;s a great product, but clumping is a deal-breaker for me.</li>
    <li> Very good-and it lasts a long time. I had a free tester first and when that was on it&#x27;s last leg, I bought the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing.  Very good mascara and very pleased.</li>
    <li> Too faced products are my favorite and I can honestly say that I have never purchased any of their products that I didn&#x27;t like. The mascara went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> I love Too Faced products, and thought I&#x27;d try this out when I saw that Amazon had been selling it for a lot less than my go-to high-end mascara, Buxom Lash.  I really like it, but it does seem to give me more length than thickening, even though it&#x27;s supposed to do both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is much thinner than I&#x27;m used to, and it&#x27;s made of a plastic that is more like a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays in place all day with no smudging or flaking -- even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are watering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit hard to remove, even when I use warm water, as other reviewers suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it gave more thickness, but I do really like it and will most likely re-purchase it once my tube runs out.</li>
    <li> This Mascara comes with one of those new type comb/wands which I really liked,however the mascara does clump your lashes togehter,and I dont know why but it only happens with this one i will see bits of it in my eye.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the fact that it has vitamins and conditioners for the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly I cannot seem to use it but it may work fantastik for somebody else.&lt;br /&gt;Funny even thought I cannot wear it I love the packaging and artwork I cannot throw it away.... in fact i still try to use it from time to time but always the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I chose it is ok simply because I really dont hate it even though it didnt work for me! ☺</li>
    <li> I have pale fine eyelashes.  When they aren&#x27;t sun bleached they&#x27;re not that short but all in all they&#x27;re not that impressive.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good mascara for ages.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that were good but not great and none were cheap.  I found this while looking for another Too Faced mascara and tried it based on the reviews and have been thrilled.  Long thick great lashes every time! I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> What I like most about this mascara is the applicator. Its more like a comb than a brush, and isn&#x27;t prone to smudging. The formula is a little on the dry side (which I like) and dries pretty quickly. It&#x27;s very easy to build some length and adds some volume, but there are drugstore mascaras that can give you the same effect. I found this on sale for around $13 and would probably not pay full price, which I think is around $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of Too Faced&#x27;s products, and if you would like to try some of their stuff (including this mascara), you might want to look at the Beauty Editor Darlings kit:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Too-Faced-Beauty-Editor-Darlings/dp/B008PQ5YC0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371911065&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;too+faced+beauty+editor+darlings+set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is still available from Sephora, too.</li>
    <li> Super disappointed . Not worth the $21.  Stick to drugstore mascaras. Will be returning it to the store I bought it from. I wanted it to thicken and all it did was lengthen, which I did not want. It didn&#x27;t flake or run down my face after 7 hours though. Still, for $21, not worth it.</li>
    <li> When I purchased some stuff from toofaced.com, I got lashgasm sample mascara for free. To be honest, I did not have high expectations of this product, so I tried this one on my lazy day. I was immensely surprised by the clump-free formula. This wand is spiky, so it separates my lashes easily while lengthening my short, Asian lashes naturally. I looked at the mirror and was so surprised that it held my curled lashes still! I usually curl my lashes because mine is really straight and short. With this mascara, I did not need to use a lash curler. This is truly my holy grail product. I definitely recommend this to the girls who suffer from short, straight lashes that don&#x27;t remain curled with mascara!</li>
    <li> This mascara is everything it claims to be and then some! Makes lashes look incredibly long and sexy. Stays on until you take it off. I love it and will buy it again.  I have to take one star away due to the difficulty factor involved with removing. I use primer before applying and maybe I shouldn&#x27;t. I find it to be a long chore to remove. But eventually it does come off-in chunks all over the sink! I won&#x27;t wear this for everyday and will save it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> absolutely loved I must order again. Totally made my lashes feel and look longer than I had ever imagined. So happy</li>
    <li> I have tried tons of mascara, and this one is by far the best. To get the best results, i use a thickening mascara first and then apply Too Faced right afterwards. They are sky high after I apply Too Faced. It is well worth the tiny splurge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no pro nor am I a scholar in the mascara department but I&#x27;ve had several kinds and this is the shizzle! Though I have only been using it two weeks. However, this mascara makes my eyelashes multiply and the length is fantastic! It doesn&#x27;t clump. I hate when mascara flakes and (TMI) lazily wore it for 24 hrs and yet minimal flaking!! A winner in my book. Its The most I have ever spent on a mascara but it&#x27;s faster and simpler than applying false lashes yet it looks pretty darn close.</li>
    <li> This mascara is probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used. The bristles are very good at catching EVERY SINGLE ONE of my lashes. I also have very short lashes, and this mascara does a great job at lengthening them! The only bad things about it are:&lt;br /&gt;-I usually have to curl my lases several times in order for the curl to stay. This mascara is almost too flexible, if you will.&lt;br /&gt;-It does not take very much effort for the mascara to flake.</li>
    <li> I read reviews and needed this mascara. It is pretty nice... but I&#x27;m not wowed away or shocked at its magnificence. Probably wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> This product makes my lashes look 2 times as full and longer! I was recommended by a makeup artist friend to try this product, and I have to say it is amazing. Amazon sells it at a better price than Sephora.</li>
    <li> I normally love Too Faced products, but this mascara was a big disappointment.  For me, it was clumpy and flaked really badly during the day - not a good thing if you are a contact lens wearer!  My eyelashes are straight, so I have to curl them before applying mascara.  My lashes go back to straight almost instantly after applying this mascara.  I am just going back to my cheap Maybelline mascara that does a very good job.  I honestly don&#x27;t know why I switched in the first place!</li>
    <li> Clumps up and flakes off within an hour or two of application. Doesn&#x27;t give any length. Just made my lashes look chunky and fake. Also, it was hard to apply a second and third coat, which I like to do with my other mascaras to add extra length and volume. If you try to add another coat it looks worse than the first coat.</li>
    <li> I love Too Faced products and bought this mascara with high hopes since it has a Subscribe and Save option.  The mascara worked great for about a week and then the wand became a goopy mess and the brush overloaded with product which resulted in clumpy eyelashes. In order to use it, I&#x27;d have to wipe away the extra product with a tissue resulting in the loss of at least half the product in the bottle. If Too Faced would change the design of the brush and wand, this would be a great mascara, but until then, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love the brand! The brush is plastics which I prefer the bristle style brushes but the mascara worked wonders lasted four HOURS.</li>
    <li> A small tube of this mascara came in Sephora&#x27;s mascara gift set. This was the best mascara out of the set, and probably the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned. The brush takes a little getting used to -- probably two or three applications until you get it exactly right. I never have any problems with flaking or clumping, and I never have to reapply. This combination of mascara and brush provides fullness at the base of the lashes and length at the end. People always ask me: \\&quot;are those your real lashes?\\&quot; And I happily respond that they are.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, so long and realistic looking. Not at all goopy or glue-like. It comes off with ease but stays on for tears. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this mascara.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MASCARA. It works very well with my lashes and really makes them look amazing!! Will purchase again</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product.  It stays on all day and makes my lashes look thicker and longer.  My daughter gave me my first Lashgasm and I loved it so much, that I ordered another one for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! It really GROWS your lashes!</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t know how else to describe this mascara that&#x27;s literally called Lashgasm lol. Have you ever seen some of the girls that dress up in anime styles and Hello Kitty gear? Their eyelashes are to die for and that means my title is a huge compliment to this product. Yeah, I know I&#x27;m weird. But I&#x27;m also straight up honest, so there you go haha. I know this can be pricey if you&#x27;re the type of girl who prefers (or needs) to shop the aisles of Target or Walmart for her cosmetic needs, cuz honestly, that&#x27;s me too. Sometimes though, you run into a product that you fall in love with and can&#x27;t live without. Say hello to one of mine. My cousin pushed me outta the way in the eyelash line and stole my share and HE has the long and lovely eyelashes while I&#x27;m stuck with the short stubbies. This mascara saved me.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. It lengthens and darkens with out being clumpy or having to put 7 coats on. The only thing that bugs me is that at the end of the day, it gets flaky and irritates my eyes.</li>
    <li> Nice,smooth application, clump free.. The formula is wonderful. In just one coat, my eyelashes were 2 tines longer and fuller</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and provides good color.</li>
    <li> I really like too faced products but I&#x27;ve been really skeptical about buying mascara as I&#x27;ve had problems finding one that works well with me, I have fairly long eyelashes to begin with and when I put mascara on I always end up trying to find that perfect amount without making it obvious that I&#x27;m wearing mascara for my everyday work life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect, one application works perfect for my everyday, sometimes an extra if I&#x27;m playing a bit more with my makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t clump and my eyelashes don&#x27;t stick together.  Would buy again and recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love Too Face mascara.  No clumps, goes on really well.  My daughter Tried it, and I had to hide it from her so she wouldn&#x27;t make off with it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara of all time! Lengthens your lashes and never clumps or smears. I do replace it every 6 weeks or so as it does eventually dry out but I think this is common with better mascaras.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to get this and received it in the mail, used if for 2 days and it was already gone. Your better off ordering off of the Too Faced website.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my eye lashes look very long. Does clump if you use too much, so don&#x27;t use too much and no problems. Definitely my favorite mascara to date!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff the only thing I wish it was waterproof because I go to the gym after work and sweat a lot. I love the way the brush seperates your lashes and it does not clump up. The best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have pretty short eyelashes and every mascara I try is either clumpy or wears off after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;Lashgasm is awesome at lengthening and lasting the whole day. I&#x27;ve never had a mascara that separates the lashes like it does, never any clumps. I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I was using Urban Decay make-up which was slightly pricier than this brand, but I think I like Too Faced even better now. The products go on great. They come in really cute vintage looking packaging and the convince of getting them through Amazon is great!!!</li>
    <li> After seeing some of the better reviews, I had hopes this would be a good new mascara to try.  But it just seems to be really runny and clump prone.</li>
    <li> I am not crazy about it. IT does not do much for my top lashes. I would rather stick to my Rimmel Scandal Eyes brand. But the small brush works great for my little lashes under my eyes.</li>
    <li> the only mascara that stays on my lashes... with the exception of mabelline royal blue.  so happy to find a good quality black mascara... applies easily...</li>
    <li> Best. Mascara. Ever.  I&#x27;m not even kidding.  Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried everything from Nyx mascara to Dior and this is by far the best. I&#x27;ve found what I&#x27;m looking for and I&#x27;m so happy the &amp;#34;perfect mascara&amp;#34; search is over!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. My lashes look full and long. The brush is not stiff, I wish it were a little stiffer for control, but it still works great, doesn&#x27;t clump or smear and it lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Great product, will keep buying and its much cheaper then in sephora store, the best mascara in my collection. I have Dior Iconic and Lancome Drama, these two are much more expensive but not better at all, so its a good deal! I recommend definitely to everybody</li>
