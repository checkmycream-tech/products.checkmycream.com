      <li>I formulate my own facial lotions and oils, and this is a good addition.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong &amp;#34;grassy&amp;#34; scent which may not be your cup of tea, but if you mix it with your cleanser, the scent lessens.</li>

      <li>Shipped super quickly.  </li>
      <li>Hair growing in thicker, softer &amp; face is super soft with fine lines going poof.!.</li>
      <li>Iv used Argan oil personally on my skin and to be honest was underwhelmed by it.</li>
      <li>I love it so far</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for those suffering from dry skin or looking for a great looking skin.</li>
      <li>but right now it is what it is</li>
      <li>I am currently using it for a facial moisturizer, and it makes my skin feel great.</li>
      <li>It is fabulous  as vitamin supplement, I take it with natural freshly squeezed fruit juice in the morning.</li>
      <li>Use it twice a day and my face is soft and fine lines have been reduces.</li>
      <li>First time using just Moringa oil on my face &amp; hair.</li>
      <li>After the first use the feeling of &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34; on his face was gone ...</li>
      <li>The oil smelled funny and it thickend and got cloudy just sitting on the counter in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>The first couple of days I used 2 pumps</li>
      <li>The strong green scent could be off-putting to some; rest assured, it dissipates pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>However, as soon as I put it on, I am overwhelmed with the scent of straight dirt.</li>
      <li>It is a very moisturizing oil will purchase again</li>
      <li>Really like Moringa oil.</li>

      <li>Works well here in the dry dessert and easy to apply with sprayer.  </li>
      <li>Pores were noticeably smaller and the smaller, fine wrinkles disappeared.</li>
      <li>Within the first three uses I noticed a BIG difference in the tone and texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>My face breaks out pretty regularly</li>
      <li>No one believes I am as old as I really am...... because my skin appears way younger. )</li>
      <li>Completely gone.</li>
      <li>Seems to help with clearing my skin, leaving it soft but not greasy.</li>
      <li>Just got the product and maybe to early to review.  </li>
      <li>My skin is soft and is looking smoother every day.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend and the price point is much better than other, more expensive oils that do the same thing.</li>
      <li>First, I have to say that I love the fact that this Herbs India Cold Pressed Organic Moringa Seed Oil comes in a spray bottle, which helps to control the amount of oil dispensed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to everything and have to be careful what products I use because most actually break me out worse.</li>

    <li> AMAZING Product! Works wonderful as my new facial moisturizer. Within the first three uses I noticed a BIG difference in the tone and texture of my skin. Pores were noticeably smaller and the smaller, fine wrinkles disappeared. After a week of use the deeper eye crinkles are getting less and less ... neck wrinkles almost gone. My fiancee has a skin condition that has his skin always looking red and bumpy, he has suffered for years with breakouts and has tried several products from prescribed to holistic ... nothing worked. After the first use the feeling of &amp;#34;needles&amp;#34; on his face was gone ... after a week the redness is greatly reduced. ZERO breakouts and he is Happy! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and will be keeping stocked up on it. :D</li>
    <li> Product arrived timely.  I use it daily in addition to my moisturizer, especially on the rough areas such as elbows and feet. The smell is not the most aromatic but the benefits are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I use a few drops of this oil with my cleanser each day.  It seems to clean and moisturize well.  It has a strong &amp;#34;grassy&amp;#34; scent which may not be your cup of tea, but if you mix it with your cleanser, the scent lessens.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin. Can&#x27;t wait to use it longer and see how it goes.</li>
    <li> The best price for Moringa oil. I have been using moringa oil as a moisturizer and do not notice any odor like dirt (soil) as some reviewers have complained and I am sensitive to odors.</li>
    <li> Great product that I purchased for the skin. I have used Indian products for a very long time and have been VERY IMPRESSED with all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Moringa Oil goes on smoothly, there is no sticky residue. My skin is soft and is looking smoother every day. I love it so far can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in another few weeks</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil for my cosmetic needs.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I researched a lot to find good quality in a great price, and this one was the one. Will be glad to do business with this seller in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I already sent link to my girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping too...</li>
    <li> I use this by itself or with an addition of essential oils as my daily facial moisturizer and for my hands.  The pump bottle is nice for dispensing.</li>
    <li> ladies! stop paying big dollars for creams that in the end not so good, give a try to  this simple natural product. I suffer for number of years from rosasea, and forever been looking everywhere for something that would work on my super sensible face skin.  This is IT. Many problems are solved-- it calms redness, it softens dryness, it absorbs fast without leaving greasy film on my face, also  it nurishes  well. Now my face finally looks even colored and all the little (damned) pimples are gone. Hurray! I aply a drop on each cheek, neck and hands after shower and that&#x27;s all I need. This oil has light texture and smells faintly like cut grass. I do prefer the oil to many expensive and not effective cosmetic products&lt;br /&gt;Other product that I would recommend -- moringa powder. It is fabulous  as vitamin supplement, I take it with natural freshly squeezed fruit juice in the morning.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try this-  it&#x27;s a lot like jojoba, and it absorbs very quickly. I formulate my own facial lotions and oils, and this is a good addition.  ( P.S.  No one believes I am as old as I really am...... because my skin appears way younger. ) Good stuff!</li>
    <li> While in Thailand a few years back, a doctor suggested this type of oil for dry skin, face, etc.  Works well here in the dry dessert and easy to apply with sprayer.  Highly recommend and the price point is much better than other, more expensive oils that do the same thing.</li>
    <li> The oil is great, the pump went after one squirt, hence 3 stars. Nothing comes up through it at all. I have other bottles, I just put it in something else, but the oil, fab.</li>
    <li> I have started using this Oil around my eyes every night  - I added 2 drops each of some essential&lt;br /&gt;oils along with 1/2 oz. of the Moringa Seed Oil in a small glass bottle and it makes a wonderful&lt;br /&gt;oil that transforms the wrinkles around the eyes....just a drop of this blend does the trick...a little goes&lt;br /&gt;a long way!</li>
    <li> Ok so I bought this to use as a substitution for rose hip oil in a scar blend I use for my daughter. I love the moringa powder and thought I would give it a try. Iv used Argan oil personally on my skin and to be honest was underwhelmed by it. This oil however I love!  My face breaks out pretty regularly and I&#x27;m waiting for the day that it doesn&#x27;t but right now it is what it is and I have to deal with it. I&#x27;m very sensitive to everything and have to be careful what products I use because most actually break me out worse. I have been using this for 3 days now and breakouts that iv had for a month that felt like hard clogged pores are gone. Completely gone. The redness in my breakouts have faded and my skin looks bright and moisturized. I use one pump in the am and one in the pm before bed. It will be a staple in my cabinet from now on. Love it</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. I am currently using it for a facial moisturizer, and it makes my skin feel great. However, as soon as I put it on, I am overwhelmed with the scent of straight dirt. Like I just went to my garden and rubbed soil on my face. It&#x27;s not so pleasant. Thankfully the odor does fade after a little while, but still...that initial smell is enough for me to rate it a little lower.</li>
    <li> First time using just Moringa oil on my face &amp; hair. It is amazing stuff. Hair growing in thicker, softer &amp; face is super soft with fine lines going poof.!. Yes, I&#x27;ll be buyingbagain.</li>
    <li> Did not care for this. The oil smelled funny and it thickend and got cloudy just sitting on the counter in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> It feels nice, has no negative side effects. It is easy to control the amount because you just use the spray.</li>
    <li> Shipped super quickly.  The first couple of days I used 2 pumps and I looked a little oily but now I just use one and it&#x27;s great.  My skin looks smooth and glowing.  A fan for life!</li>
    <li> It is a very moisturizing oil will purchase again</li>
    <li> Still trying the oil  But the bottle&#x27;s spray top did not have the cap on it. I didn&#x27;t like that</li>
    <li> Just got the product and maybe to early to review.  I started using it for my face and body and I liked it.</li>
    <li> works great for my face overnight - plus it&#x27;s great against winter skin drying out</li>
    <li> very happy with this product!</li>

    <li> a really good oil for the face.</li>
    <li> so far so good. Use on hair</li>
    <li> Wish it was a larger bottle.  Seems to help with clearing my skin, leaving it soft but not greasy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my dry skin. Highly recommended for those suffering from dry skin or looking for a great looking skin.</li>
    <li> Really like Moringa oil. Very healing oil</li>
    <li> I like it so much . It works for acne face . It looks like my face looks brighter and my acne scar way better than before I love this it&#x27;s a keeper</li>

    <li> Excellent product. Great for everything: for skin , for hair, for scrapes and rashes.</li>
    <li> Use it twice a day and my face is soft and fine lines have been reduces. I am very very happy with this product.</li>
