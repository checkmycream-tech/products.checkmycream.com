### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The ingredient list is impressive:</li>
      <li>While the bar lathers up well and smells awesome</li>
      <li>and I find that this is the best one.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell of this bar, nothing compares to the smell of jasmine!!</li>
      <li>Although I loved the smell of this shampoo, it ruined my beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>It lathers great and works nice for body soap too.</li>
      <li>The smell is good too -</li>
      <li>My friend borrowed it once on a trip and she LOVED the way it made her hair</li>
      <li>I do not keep it in the tin, but keep it in a hanging bath organizer with good drainage that does not let it get soggy.</li>
      <li>I still apply a dollop of leave in conditioner after I shower though, just for good measure.   </li>
      <li>It formed a gel-type substance on the shower ledge each time we used it and we lost a good amount of product that way.</li>
      <li>This one is right up there with my favorites, great scent, wonderful shine and the ease of a bar shampoo.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and my hair feels squeaky clean after each shampoo.  </li>
      <li>there is no question that seanik works much better and leaves your hair way softer!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect amount of conditioning and cleaning, my hair always looks great (never greasy), I love the environmentally-friendly lack of packaging, and one bar lasts several months.  </li>
      <li>It smells very light and pleasant, not overpowering and it leaves my fine hair feeling silky, manageable and full of body.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent and environmentally friendly product that leaves the hair very soft.</li>
      <li>Also, this bar makes my hair smell wonderful, and the smell lasts even into the next day.</li>
      <li>you are in love with the Flying Fox shower gel and temple balm, this may be the one you want.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
      <li>I love most about these bars</li>
      <li>/&gt;You cannot beat shampoo bars for traveling and the \\&quot;green\\&quot; aspects of being enviromentally better.</li>
      <li>but I like the light flower-spice mix of the Godiva, and it makes the whole room smell good to boot!  </li>
      <li>if you smell the bar alone, you may think the smell is too strong, but no worries, when you wash your hair with it the smell becomes much more mild, but still leaves your hair with a nice scent the rest of the day..........</li>
      <li>I loved this bar almost as much as Trichomania, also with coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They even have convenient little tins (which you get for free if you buy 2 bars) that make them perfect for travel and</li>
      <li>Thinking how can so many people have such good things to say about it I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>Worth the $10 I paid for!</li>
      <li>My hair feels squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>I have straight fine hair that tangles easily, this product claimed to have conditioner in it.  </li>
      <li>First I tried Lush soap and absolutely loved it.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough awesome things about this line of shampoo bars and especially the Godiva bar.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super picky about things being scent-free</li>
      <li>I have a ton of straight fine hair and conditioners</li>
      <li>If you love this smell or any jasmine smell as much as i do, Lush makes TONS of stuff that smells like this.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how much fun it was to use the shampoo bars, except you do have to keep them out of the shower or in a shampoo bar</li>
      <li>Mine did and now it is bouncy, shiny, and soft  :)    </li>
      <li>and I could feel a difference right away</li>
      <li>It lathered up very nicely, and even after a month and a half of using the product, I still have more than 1/2 the bar left!</li>
      <li>Lush has so many great shampoos that it&#x27;s really hard to pick a \\&quot;Best\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>cause it just plain smells amazing!</li>
      <li>Since I leave it on bathroom counter, the whole room smells fresh.</li>
      <li>This bar has a lovely smell about it that permeates the entire bathroom</li>
      <li>This led me to review the ingredients, and I noted that the first ingredient is Sodium Laurel Sulfate.</li>
      <li>After the first use I could tell a difference.</li>
      <li>I just wish that the moisturizing element in it were a bit more powerful, as I have dry hair.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo cake for my fine straight greasy hair that quickly dissolves into a lumpy mess after a few uses.  </li>
      <li>But this seems way over priced even for a very high quality soap.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing shampoo.</li>
      <li>My hair was silky smooth, and stayed that way until I washed it 2 days later!</li>
      <li>This product is very travel-friendly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very conditioning and makes my hair shiny.</li>
      <li>They do work very well together, but you can probably get away with just the shampoo bar.</li>
      <li>this is a very drying shampoo.  </li>
      <li>But you really don&#x27;t need the tin</li>
      <li>It also fell apart very quickly even though we tried to keep it out of the water after use and let it dry.</li>
      <li>Im gonna make this short and sweet...</li>
      <li>Overall I think the product is good, maybe next time I will try a different one.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
      <li>The fragrance in the bar was a little overpowering for me in the beginning, but I love it now.    </li>
      <li>It lathers nicely, smells beautiful, but works horribly.</li>
      <li>When I first tried this bar, my hair did feel very conditioned, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was a 2 in 1 bar, so I used American Cream conditioner too.</li>
      <li>This solid shampoo does smell nice when washing your hair in the shower, however I did not notice the scent after my hair was dried and styled.  </li>
      <li>If that was not amazing enough it cleans and leaves my hair feeling so good.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try this solid shampoo because I&#x27;ve wanted to try LUSH products for a long time, and luckily we have a store in our local mall.</li>
      <li>always either grease it up or frizz it out - until Lush!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to try the other scents from Lush after I am done with Godiva!</li>
      <li>This bar is great; it not only cleans my long, thick, curly hair, but also begins the conditioning process.</li>
      <li>This little bar does all the things that those huge bottles of shampoo/conditioner would do.    </li>
      <li>you really don&#x27;t want to take any liquids on the plane, Lush also makes a solid conditioner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few solid shampoo bars by Lush and this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>but I personally didn&#x27;t like that product so much.</li>
      <li>Then I tried this from Lush (bought it at the store).</li>
      <li>I used it after coloring my hair and my hair felt so soft</li>
      <li>However, I was disappointed with Godiva (as was a good friend of mine) for two simple reasons: 1) it crumbles quickly and 2) parts of it never seem to dissolve, whole pieces sitting stuck in my shower drain for weeks without the water washing them away.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend Lush products, not only for the lack of artificial ingredients, but because they work (and really smell good).</li>
      <li>I find that I do not need a separate conditioner with this particular solid shampoo, so that saves money and landfills too.</li>
      <li>Worthy but a mess.</li>
      <li>Bars like Squeaky Green can last months -- I can&#x27;t get Godiva to last more than 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I had perfected my hair routine, but was ready for a change and had heard a lot about dry shampoo bars.   </li>
      <li>Flying fox shower gel, there is Alkmaar soap bar and lastly there is the Gorilla perfume called Lust which is by far the strongest of them but lasts forever!</li>
      <li>I tried going back to my old shampoo</li>
      <li>This is the second shampoo bar I have from Lush.</li>
      <li>I have African American naturally curly hair and keeping it soft and moisturized is my goal and task</li>
      <li>I was actually scared...and had to do breathing excercises to calm myself down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Lush and solid shampoos in general.</li>
      <li>It also left our hair feeling dried out and in need of a separate conditioner, which is unusual because we normally use 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners.</li>
      <li>, is what I thought as soon as I swiped the bar through my 4b African American natural hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 37 year old male who stumbled across this product and was a skeptic when I saw a solid shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this shampoo bar several times from the local Lush store and find the scent intoxicating enough to overlook some of the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; of the Godiva Shampoo Bar.</li>
      <li>But, this one falls apart too easily... and as a result, doesn&#x27;t last half as long as other solid shampoo bars.</li>
      <li>which is too bad because it is a good all-purpose soap/shampoo/conditioner/shave cream.</li>

<li> Hibiscus Extreact, Shea Butter, Camellia Oil, Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Coconut Butter, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang Oil, Cypress Oil, Palmarosa Oil and even a few little jasmine flowers just for fun.</li>
<li> Initially my hair felt course after rinsing it, but once it dried it, it was soooo soft</li>
<li> Maybe I got a bad batch, or maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled be Lush&#x27;s other bars and more traditional solid shampoo bars.  </li>
<li> /&gt;We were very disappointed with our Godiva shampoo because it took MANY more than the \\&quot;few</li>
<li> Of course my crazy tresses need more conditioner, but I could definitly tell the difference when I use this bar as opposed to others.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lush has so many great shampoos that it&#x27;s really hard to pick a \\&quot;Best\\&quot;  This one is right up there with my favorites, great scent, wonderful shine and the ease of a bar shampoo.</li>
    <li> this is a very drying shampoo.  it is full of sulfates and very harsh for color-treated hair and not great for very dry hair.  Do not recommend!!!</li>
    <li> When I first tried this bar, my hair did feel very conditioned, but I didn&#x27;t realize it was a 2 in 1 bar, so I used American Cream conditioner too. They do work very well together, but you can probably get away with just the shampoo bar. I was amazed at how much fun it was to use the shampoo bars, except you do have to keep them out of the shower or in a shampoo bar tin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in love with the Flying Fox shower gel and temple balm, this may be the one you want. The ingredient list is impressive: Hibiscus Extreact, Shea Butter, Camellia Oil, Jojoba Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Coconut Butter, Jasmine, Ylang Ylang Oil, Cypress Oil, Palmarosa Oil and even a few little jasmine flowers just for fun. I loved this bar almost as much as Trichomania, also with coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering if having hard water makes a difference when using the shampoo bars. I bought a shower filter and haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with anything I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> What The Heck Did This Thing Do To My Hair?!, is what I thought as soon as I swiped the bar through my 4b African American natural hair. As soon as I started massaging the lather into my head my hair felt matted, stripped, and left with a layer of film on it. The film felt like Shea Butter buildup. My hair felt like I had just used the harshest clarifying shampoo ever, and it left a little present of residue.  I couldn&#x27;t even get my fingers through my hair. I was actually scared...and had to do breathing excercises to calm myself down. I have never ever had any shampoo have this effect. Thank God my hair softened and recovered as soon as I used Infusium 23 Moistureology conditioner and rinsed.  I also had to deep condition. I definately agree with the other reviewer. If you have a problem with dryness with your hair DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT! This product did not condition my hair whatsoever. The only reason I&#x27;m giving the product a 2 is because I like the way it smells. If I had known then what I know now... I would have definately left this product at the store.</li>
    <li> I will confess, I haven&#x27;t taken this soap out to try yet. I&#x27;m still deciding whether I&#x27;ve been hosed. This is about the size of 3 small hotel bars of soap for $10, and $7 shipping. I&#x27;m very annoyed.  I&#x27;ve made home made soap before. It&#x27; a mess. Worthy but a mess. But this seems way over priced even for a very high quality soap. It&#x27;s just too small a bar to be asking $10 for.</li>
    <li> I have never tried solid shampoo before, and typically my long, thick hair was unmanagable. When I washed it it was dry, then became greasy after the day was done. Then I tried this from Lush (bought it at the store). My hair was silky smooth, and stayed that way until I washed it 2 days later! It lathered up very nicely, and even after a month and a half of using the product, I still have more than 1/2 the bar left! Worth the $10 I paid for! I&#x27;m excited to try the other scents from Lush after I am done with Godiva!</li>
    <li> I have long brown hair, that tends to be on the dry side. Also, my hair isn&#x27;t thin or thick, more of in-between. I had perfected my hair routine, but was ready for a change and had heard a lot about dry shampoo bars.   After the first use I could tell a difference. It suds up quickly (a little goes a long way, and I have LONG hair!). I only run it through my hair once or twice (sometimes I rub it between my hands and apply it that way to my hair). I&#x27;ve had the bar two months now, and it&#x27;s only half the size of when I bought it so I&#x27;m expecting it to last another two months. I wash my hair every other day, and it&#x27;s so soft and manageable with this bar. I still apply a dollop of leave in conditioner after I shower though, just for good measure.   My hair feels squeaky clean. Initially my hair felt course after rinsing it, but once it dried it, it was soooo soft I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it. Also, this bar makes my hair smell wonderful, and the smell lasts even into the next day. Since I leave it on bathroom counter, the whole room smells fresh. The fragrance in the bar was a little overpowering for me in the beginning, but I love it now.    It is expensive, but worth it (especially since I&#x27;ve gotten two months use out of it so far and still have half of it left). I tried going back to my old shampoo and I could feel a difference right away - my hair was less manageable and it felt heavy and lifeless. Also, my hair was greasy the next morning.   Not a fan of the packaging - Yes, I know you can buy the tins, but I already paid 10 bucks for this product, you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d give you one. But you really don&#x27;t need the tin, I keep my out of the water when I shower, often to the side. I leave the bar out to dry after use, fully, on my counter. Then I put it back into the little baggy I bought it in. It&#x27;s fully intact, and shows no signs of breakage.</li>
    <li> Im gonna make this short and sweet...I LOVE the smell of this bar, nothing compares to the smell of jasmine!! But here is the deal, between this and Seanik there is no question that seanik works much better and leaves your hair way softer! If you love this smell or any jasmine smell as much as i do, Lush makes TONS of stuff that smells like this. To name a few, theres Flying fox shower gel, there is Alkmaar soap bar and lastly there is the Gorilla perfume called Lust which is by far the strongest of them but lasts forever! But for the record i do still leave this bar in my shower cause it just plain smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I flipped between the hard shampoo bar and this for a while but started out with this instead. And it does what it said. I used it after coloring my hair and my hair felt so soft i actually can&#x27;t wait to use it again. I have African American naturally curly hair and keeping it soft and moisturized is my goal and task and this does it. I do have some hard water and it helps against. I will try the other but till i do this is a life saver for my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few solid shampoo bars by Lush and this one is my favorite.  It smells wonderful and my hair feels squeaky clean after each shampoo.  But, this one falls apart too easily... and as a result, doesn&#x27;t last half as long as other solid shampoo bars.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo cake for my fine straight greasy hair that quickly dissolves into a lumpy mess after a few uses.  Yes I have tried different methods of storage and drainage, nothing helps.  Unsuitable for travel which is too bad because it is a good all-purpose soap/shampoo/conditioner/shave cream.</li>
    <li> Although I loved the smell of this shampoo, it ruined my beautiful hair. This led me to review the ingredients, and I noted that the first ingredient is Sodium Laurel Sulfate. It also contains propylene glycol, a petroleum based product. It dried my hair out, and it started falling out. I kept using it for a few days due to my love of the scent, but alas, I had to think about my poor hair and stop. I would not recommend this product. It lathers nicely, smells beautiful, but works horribly. Try something else.</li>
    <li> This bar has a lovely smell about it that permeates the entire bathroom It lathers up big for its size and cleans some hair. I just wish that the moisturizing element in it were a bit more powerful, as I have dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this shampoo bar several times from the local Lush store and find the scent intoxicating enough to overlook some of the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; of the Godiva Shampoo Bar. While the bar lathers up well and smells awesome it does tend to break apart after just a few shampoo sessions. Usually I just use it as soap at that point but for almost $10 that&#x27;s an expensive bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat shampoo bars for traveling and the \\&quot;green\\&quot; aspects of being enviromentally better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to review things on amazon but I want to tell everyone about this thing so here goes:  I have a ton of straight fine hair and conditioners always either grease it up or frizz it out - until Lush!  I was backpacking and had to eliminate weight so I picked one up on impulse one day in England, and I haven&#x27;t stoppped using it since (it&#x27;s been well over a year).  It&#x27;s perfect amount of conditioning and cleaning, my hair always looks great (never greasy), I love the environmentally-friendly lack of packaging, and one bar lasts several months.  The smell is good too - I&#x27;m super picky about things being scent-free but I like the light flower-spice mix of the Godiva, and it makes the whole room smell good to boot!  HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> First I tried Lush soap and absolutely loved it.  Then I decided to try the shampoo.  That was about 9 month ago, and the only one I use now.  Having tried dozens of brands of expensive shampoo, I had about given up, but now some shine is back in my hair, and no more ugly bed head.  Would highly recommend Lush products, not only for the lack of artificial ingredients, but because they work (and really smell good).</li>
    <li> This solid shampoo does smell nice when washing your hair in the shower, however I did not notice the scent after my hair was dried and styled.  I have straight fine hair that tangles easily, this product claimed to have conditioner in it.  I found that I still needed to use my usual store bought conditioner, so I could get a comb through my wet hair, which didn&#x27;t really bother me but thought I should mention it.  Overall I think the product is good, maybe next time I will try a different one.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent and environmentally friendly product that leaves the hair very soft. I tried several other soaps for hair and I find that this is the best one. Think of all those plastic shampoo bottles and energy wasted to get those heavy bottles to the store shelves. If everyone switched to solid shampoos there would be a lot less plastic waste to go into the fills. This little bar does all the things that those huge bottles of shampoo/conditioner would do.    It lasts forever- one bar has lasted for two months for me. I do have short hair though, and I lather up only once. That is all you need. I think repeat lather could dry up the hair. I do not keep it in the tin, but keep it in a hanging bath organizer with good drainage that does not let it get soggy. I did not find the problem with pieces of it clogging the drain or getting stuck in the hair that another reviewer mentioned.    Also consider the regulations with taking liquid shampoos on the plane. This product is very travel-friendly. I find that I do not need a separate conditioner with this particular solid shampoo, so that saves money and landfills too.</li>
    <li> This bar is great; it not only cleans my long, thick, curly hair, but also begins the conditioning process. Of course my crazy tresses need more conditioner, but I could definitly tell the difference when I use this bar as opposed to others. It lathers great and works nice for body soap too. My only complaint is that the scent does not linger. Even trying it without other conditioner, the scent was gone by the time my hair was dry. I absolutly recommend this product though!</li>
    <li> Well too make the long story short.  I&#x27;m a 37 year old male who stumbled across this product and was a skeptic when I saw a solid shampoo.  Thinking how can so many people have such good things to say about it I ordered it.  I was shocked by how well it works, and how much it lathers up with just 2 swipes.  If that was not amazing enough it cleans and leaves my hair feeling so good.  I think I will never go back to a liquid shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this solid shampoo because I&#x27;ve wanted to try LUSH products for a long time, and luckily we have a store in our local mall. We decided to purchase this shampoo for our honeymoon so that we could bring it in our carry-on bags on the plane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were very disappointed with our Godiva shampoo because it took MANY more than the \\&quot;few swipes\\&quot; the store rep had told us in order to get the shampoo to lather. It also left our hair feeling dried out and in need of a separate conditioner, which is unusual because we normally use 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners. It also fell apart very quickly even though we tried to keep it out of the water after use and let it dry. It formed a gel-type substance on the shower ledge each time we used it and we lost a good amount of product that way. All in all, we both only got about 2 weeks of use out of it. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough awesome things about this line of shampoo bars and especially the Godiva bar. It smells very light and pleasant, not overpowering and it leaves my fine hair feeling silky, manageable and full of body. My friend borrowed it once on a trip and she LOVED the way it made her hair feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about these bars is their solid form for air travel. I don&#x27;t have to worry about a million stupid little bottles for my cosmetics and I have plenty of shampoo for any trip I might take when I travel by air. They even have convenient little tins (which you get for free if you buy 2 bars) that make them perfect for travel and storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat is that when the bar gets down to a little wafer, it begins to break apart and when you&#x27;re down to the last bits, its hard to use it all up. I end up throwing the last bit away because it just crumbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really don&#x27;t want to take any liquids on the plane, Lush also makes a solid conditioner but I personally didn&#x27;t like that product so much. The Godiva bar has a little bit of conditioner in it already so I can usually skip it.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing shampoo. I have naturally wavy, thick, coarse hair that is colored every 3 months or so.     If I use Godiva, I don&#x27;t need conditioner!     I would mention though- if you usually use a shampoo with silicones in it, you will need to give this a chance to work as your hair is weaned off of the chemicals. It may feel coarse and brittle for a wash or two as your hair recuperates. Mine did and now it is bouncy, shiny, and soft  :)    Also - the smell lingers - if you don&#x27;t like Jasmine, don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
    <li> This is the second shampoo bar I have from Lush. It&#x27;s very conditioning and makes my hair shiny. if you smell the bar alone, you may think the smell is too strong, but no worries, when you wash your hair with it the smell becomes much more mild, but still leaves your hair with a nice scent the rest of the day..........</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Lush and solid shampoos in general. However, I was disappointed with Godiva (as was a good friend of mine) for two simple reasons: 1) it crumbles quickly and 2) parts of it never seem to dissolve, whole pieces sitting stuck in my shower drain for weeks without the water washing them away.  Maybe I got a bad batch, or maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled be Lush&#x27;s other bars and more traditional solid shampoo bars.  But how can I wash my hair, save money and the planet with something that falls apart in my hands, half washes down the drain and half clogs up my drain? Bars like Squeaky Green can last months -- I can&#x27;t get Godiva to last more than 2 weeks.</li>
