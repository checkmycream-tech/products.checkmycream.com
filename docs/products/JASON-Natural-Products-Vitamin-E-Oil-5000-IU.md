<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am pregnant and I rub this on my belly and breasts at night before bed. It isn&#x27;t to greasy, absorbs fairly quick. Only thing, is this is not pure Vitamin E oil.</li>
    <li> I love Vit E oil.  Jason&#x27;s makes a superior product.  I wish it came in a larger bottle.  Great Buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice light oil and has a slight pleasant smell.  I love using it as an alternative to lotion on my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Dry winter skin calls for something extra, and this beauty oil was just the thing.  It has a gentle scent and absorbs easily, to prevent chapped lips and minimize wrinkles around the eyes.  The price was right, too!</li>
    <li> I was told to use Vitamin E oil on my post-acne marks(little red dots left from acne.) This exact brand of Vitamin E oil was in a magazine that said it would heal/fade post-acne marks. I bought the product and used it on my post-acne marks for about two months. I didnt see a difference at all in my marks. So of course I thought this was just another product that&#x27;s going to go to waste. But before I was going to throw it away, I put it on my hands to see if it would work on my dry hands. It did! It made my hands so soft and smooth. I love this stuff now! It gives my body a pretty glow and it makes my legs have that silky smooth look. Now I&#x27;m glad I bought it, it really is a wonderful product. I no longer use lotion, I only use my Jason&#x27;s vitamin E oil now!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife to complement the organic Vitamin E cream she has been using.  She is very happy with the results and especially the pleasent fragrance.  I have even tried in for dried skin and recommend it. We will purchase this product again</li>
    <li> I was so angry when I received this product in the mail and found out that it was no pure vitamin E.  Under ingredients on the website it only lists vitamin E, but on the bottle there are at least 5 different oils.  what a piece of junk!</li>
    <li> The product is great but you can buy it much cheaper at Kroger, in which I discovered after purchase.</li>
    <li> what vitamin E oil does it give the skin oxidants which  prevents further inflammation  or redness around the scar and smoothing out the skin , if you want smooth skin and non scared area, used a silicon gel cica care (50$ or scar away 20$ your choice...) wait a month ...make sure all the dead skin is exfoliated with  non chemical peel (your skin will die naturally  and come off during the therapy ) then add the vitamin E... Vitamin E has the same result  as fish oil , the only way vitamin E or fish Oil can help with scaring is if its implied on the wound its self during its time  it has scabbed as it will result with quicker anti-inflammatory properties  which is what causes  perhaps 15% of scars</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful product. A little expensive, but I can understand why, with all the essential oils combined within it. Smells like sweet almond oil. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this after a recent neck surgery for the scar. Whether it worked or not is difficult to say as I am a quick healer. However after doing some research albeit a bit late I was disturbed to learn that Jason admits to using synthetic Vitamin E oil in this product. I became suspicious when they didn&#x27;t mention whether it was D or DL Tocopheryl. So much for 95% organic. You can read the story at the below link.         [...]</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love using Vitamin E oil and natural oils instead of lotion, because lotions are very drying due to the alcohol in them. This oil was great and less expensive than many of the others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> put in my  lotion and it work perfect</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s vitamin e oil, so it is what it is. Seems to be a better price and you get more than other brands in the store.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil at Whole Foods when I was having skin allergies and this oil has really helped to tone down inflammations. I still use this oil occasionally during really cold days when my face is really dry. It works like a miracle overnight and kept my skin soft and supple upon waking up in the morning. Do be warned that this oil is very greasy and should be washed off first thing in the morning. The nourishing qualities of this oil really outweighs any greasy feelings for me. A little goes a long way! I&#x27;ve had this oil for months now and it&#x27;s barely half gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The almond scent is also really pleasant and nice. It also makes a great base for any oil based products. I really like to just apply it topically before bed. After a shower, I use a little bit of the oil on the ends of my hair to lock in moisture. It does a great job! I really like this oil for its multi purpose uses because it&#x27;s inexpensive and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that really bugs me is the poor packaging. The lid is horrible, and is hard to open/close when you have oil on your hands. They need to make this into a pump instead because the snap on lid is really tough. I just twist off the cap and squeeze the oil out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, besides the horrible packaging, this Vitamin E oil really packs a punch. It&#x27;s great to have because it&#x27;s very moisturizing, very nourishing for your skin and hair and smells pleasant enough to use daily.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, as described, i need to take the time to use it now and make diy body lotion</li>
    <li> Wonderful texture, subtle nutty smell, quick absorbing. I massaged it into a scar from knee surgery, and it really helped. Now I use all over as an effective, natural skin softener.</li>
    <li> Love using it after cleaning my face at night!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I put this on my face in the morning and also put it on my elbows (which are dry) and it is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Utah, you can put all sorts of moisturizers on and they are of variable effectiveness.  Most (pretty much all but that is generalizing to the extreme because I am sure there is something I haven&#x27;t tried yet) do NOT keep one&#x27;s skin moisturized throughout the day.  That is why I resorted to Vitamin E; it is quite oily but it keeps one&#x27;s (or at least my) skin moisturized all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this. Oh, also, it keeps me fairly young.  I am almost 40 and I get several comments that I do not look my age (however that is supposed to look).</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect upon purchasing this, but after having stitches in my forehead and being repeatedly told \\&quot;buy vitamin e oil\\&quot; I purchased this. I only just started using it so can&#x27;t comment on the scar-minimizing qualities, but I&#x27;ve started using it as lotion! It is so moisturizing and surprisingly not greasy - it soaks right in and makes my winter skin feel great!  From my legs to the scar on my forehead I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use this vitamin E oil for my stretched ears. This stuff healed scar tissue that was months old. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t smell strongly.</li>
    <li> It goes on very smooth and light. The scent of almond is definitely a plus. Love this line of products!</li>
    <li> This is a very refined oil that is very rich and a very good product. Glad I ordered it would like to order more in the future</li>
    <li> Works as it should be. Oil doesn&#x27;t smell bad too.</li>
    <li> Suffering from dry winter lips? Or just suffer from chronic chapped lips (regardless of the season?!) . I picked up this vitamin E oil at a health food store to soothe a patch of dry skin. I started putting it on my lips at night and my lips have never felt better. I have purchased vitamin E oil before but this particular line of oil by Jason is very thick, almost like a vitamin E gel and not like an oil. It is also blended with five other essential oils. I honestly don&#x27;t think I have ever put anything better on my lips to moisturize them. Put some aquaphor over the vitamin E to seal it in and you will have baby soft lips in no time! And the best part is that the bottle costs about $5. You need only the tiniest amount. I imagine the bottle will easily last me a year. For more reviews and tips visit pimples and wrinkles. And be on the lookout for the launch of our new site this month that will include spa reviews, product reviews and treatment reviews. See you at pimples and wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Great for hair and skin :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I mix it in my vit. C serum and I wonder how I ever got along without it!  It absorbs very well and smells great!  I will buy more of this for sure!  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> Best of what there is to choose from - it is a bit pricey compared what I found in the store, but was worth the cost. Don&#x27;t use much at a time, so it should last a good long while. Healing properties are terrific. Even use it on small cuts &amp; scratches once they have formed a scab over it - heals more quickly without scar tissue. Great value.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to use on my face. Its a little thick for that so what I did is I poured 2 TB spoons of white sugar in a bowl, added enough oil to make a paste and use it as a facial scrub. Rinse with warm water, pat face dry and it dries soft, not oily. I also use it in my lotion, add three drops of oil to a dime size dollop of lotion, rub hands together to mix and spread on arms and legs. Feels great and the oil has an almond scent that works with anything. I also use it in place of baby oil to remove wax residue-works great!</li>
    <li> I do not know what can I say  But the packaging is very bad . It&#x27;s open and close very very easily &#x3D;&gt;Spill in my box before I use it , and spoil my other purchases!</li>
    <li> I used this product twice on my face and both times, areas of my face broke out in painful red blotches.  My eyes got red and puffy.  A person in a local heath food store said that these are not the best products.  I do not recommend this, especially not on your face.</li>
    <li> The ingredient listed for this item is \\&quot;vitamin E oil\\&quot;, so I purchased it. My youngest child has severe allergies and one of the reasons I only buy products with known ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item, once received, proved to not be comprised solely of vitamin E oil, but to contain the following ingredients, which I am listing below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Ingredients: Tocopheryl acetate, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil*, carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil*, borago officinalis seed oil, camellia  sinensis leaf oil, macadamia temifolia seed oil, oenothera biennis (evening primrose) oil, ribes nigrum (black currant) seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed by the listing of only vitamin E oil, as opposed to an honest listing of all the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and it smells soooo good.  Unfortunately, the smell goes away within minutes, too bad because it&#x27;s very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I love to put vitamin E in my home made lotion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil for use along my hairline and for skin dryness.  I was pleasantly surprised at the scent of the oil.  It has a sweet and natural scent which is good when applying to your hair.  The oil is not heavy or oily.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing, I out it all over my body. It doesn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive skin, it actually gets rid of pimples. I also use it on the rest of my body. It helps with my eczema on my arms. This is better than the $150 dollar Caudalie cream I used on my face.</li>
    <li> I wanted pure vitamin e oil. This is not. Smells good. Absorbs fast. Just not pure. Vitamin e is like the fifth ingredient.</li>
    <li> This oil is magic!  My mom introduced me to it after she had a motorcycle accident; she was using it on her road rash and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast she healed up.  I use it for deep moisturizing and to treat healed wounds to reduce scarring.  I&#x27;ve also used it on the many hours of recent tattoo work I&#x27;ve had done.  My artist keeps commenting on how well I&#x27;m healing and I tell him it&#x27;s the Vitmin E Oil!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for Pure Vitamin E Oil without other oils mixed with it; this is not it.  This oil is made WITH pure vitamin e but, it is not 100% vitamin e.  I was looking for Vitamin E to use in my hair concoction, however, this oil is basically a concoction on its own.  It is a nice skin oil, just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have tried many things, nothing helped with streachmarks, even doctors told me nothing can, but when i put this oil on, within a week i see a difference in the way the lines appear less, my skin becomes soft (and stay that way for days) and even some discoloration diminishes, it smells like almonds, and i feel so pampered when i use it, now i&#x27;m in my 5th month pregnancy, and i bought 6 bottles, but i know i&#x27;ll need more after a few months, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and it came just in time.</li>
    <li> Best all-around Vitamin E Oil.  It does contain other oils. I&#x27;ve used it for years and hope they never stop making it.  I combine this oil in my hand with my body lotion and my skin is marvelously soft and moisturized.  It does not leave an oily residue like others I have used.  I sometimes use it at night on my face and wake up with the smoothest skin.  Also great used on cuticles and as bath oil.  Has a marvelous mild scent.</li>
    <li> Works great when you just get out of the shower. The oil leaves you skin feeling baby smooth! I love rubbing it on when I wear shorts, skirts and dresses. It looks amazing when used sparingly. A small drop could really go a long way.</li>
    <li> The oil feels good and really aids the skin. It takes a while for it to settle in once applicated, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have all the results it suggests. I use it, however, almost daily because of how soft it seems to make my skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking it was pure Vitamin E oil as advertised but it is not.  It has other oil ingredients, even though the write up lists the only ingredient as Vitamin E oil.  Rather disappointed but not sure it is worth returning for the price.  I purchased this to make an allergen free lip gloss but as it contains almonds and wheat, to which I am allergic, it&#x27;s a waste.  Rather perturbed about this, not usual for Amazon in my experience.</li>
    <li> I purchase his oil a while back  this oil is such a great softner , I mix this oil in my hair products and my home made conditioners.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil on my face for about two years now. ONE bottle has lasted me TWO YEARS! I use this every night after washing my face. I start around my eye area then smooth it over the rest of my face. I used to have very annoying acne and acne scars, this oil has helped my skin so much. It has helped fade my scars and when I wake up in the morning my face is so clear and smooth, I absolutely love it. It keeps my eye area moisturized and I really think it keeps me looking younger. One of the first signs of aging is lines around the eyes and so far so good! When I tell people my age they think I am much younger. I will continue to use this forever and hopefully it will keep me looking young!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Others have commented on how the snap-shut cap is annoying because it sends the product flying through the air... this is true but I make sure to close the cap tightly against my fingers so that any excess oil stays on my hands :)</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this oil. The scent is overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Love the product and it has a smell that I can tolerate since I am allergic to all scents.</li>
    <li> Really like Jason products. This product is another example of their quality. Would buy again! I have noticed the benefits of using already.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mixture of oils, which I somehow did not realize. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but only ok at treating scrapes, which is why I orginally bought it.</li>
    <li> Excellent, all natural product. No chemicals whatsoever (parabens, phalates, sulfates, etc). The oil is a beautiful amber color and perfectly clear (nothing floating). I am using this to make my own moisturizer. I am extremely happy with the results. High recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised nobody is talking about the smell of this oil. I&#x27;m super sensitive to odors, and the minute I opened the bottle, I was sorry I ordered it. I would describe it for you, but I&#x27;ve never smelled anything like it, sort of cheap perfumy, like those car deodorizers people hang from their mirrors......or that smell that hits you when you walk into a public restroom. I don&#x27;t want to use it on my face or anywhere that I can smell it, though the scent does dissipate fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would they want to add a scent? I thought \\&quot;Jason\\&quot; products were all about being natural. Pure vitamin E isn&#x27;t the greatest scent in the world, but I&#x27;d much rather they hadn&#x27;t tried to mask it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because it&#x27;s a nice enough texture, and I&#x27;ll probably use it, or at least keep it until it&#x27;s too rancid, but I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this for many of my homemade liquid lotion/soap recipes. It is a great preservative. When I stated using it in my soap recipes, the soap definitely had a longer shelf life.&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for a quick light oil to use directly on the skin.</li>
    <li> We LOVE this stuff. I use it on everything... Cuts, scrapes, bug bites, scars...everything! It is such an amazing oil. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Very good product and will I will buy it again it&#x27;s go to put in other product to be put all over your body</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to mix in an at home lotion and body scrub. I loved the soft almond smell. This product was the secret ingredient in my lotions which made them feel like a treat. I would buy this again for dry skin... although i&#x27;m sure it would work on all skin types as well.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.  Can&#x27;t wait to use in my body butters.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, thank you!</li>
    <li> I mixed a capful of this Vitamin E oil with a cup of coconut oil in a plastic bottle and use a little each night as a moisturizer before I go to bed. My skin is dry but this doesn&#x27;t goop it up at all. My skin absorbs it quickly and leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated. i also mix this into my hair oil mix (Black Castor, Coconut, Jojoba) and it has worked wonders. This is always good to have on hand, the smaller bottle is best since it doesn&#x27;t stay fresh forever.</li>
    <li> I use it on my face every day...keeps wrinkles away (I&#x27;m 28) and heals blemishes WHOA fast. I still get breakouts once a month (yay, being a woman of childbearing age rules) but I just use clindamycin and this together to keep those at bay. It keeps me from drying out, helps me with makeup removal and isn&#x27;t so heavy that I look like I&#x27;ve been eating fried chicken hands free. It absorbs fast too, just do it right after washing with warm water.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this oil! It makes me skin feel moisturized and soft and it smells SoOoOo good! (Almost like Almond essential oil). LOVE this and will use this for a very long time!</li>
    <li> The bottle was not properly sealed and did leak a bit on to the other contents of my parcel, but not that much spilled and it was too much of a hassle to return. That being said I love the product.</li>
    <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t moisturize your skin but give you that icky feeling when you have it on. Makes you feel like washing it off. Not sure if this is working.</li>
    <li> I love vitamin E oil because it is great for my dark circles under my eyes and it also helps my sunburns!</li>
    <li> Excellent Vitamin E Oil for the dry skin.  Actually, this is the best Vitamin E Oil I ever use.  Help me to smooth my skin and also repair the cuts and scraps.</li>
    <li> I recently started making my own hair and body products and decided to give this oil a try.  I love it.  Vitamin E oil has so many uses.  It is an excellent moisturizer and is very light and non greasy and is very good for hair growth.  This oil is great and it mixes very well with other oils and products.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product smells and the price was also reasonable. I only have to use a small amount for this product to work.</li>
    <li> Smell is delicious...slightly almond. Absorbs quickly. Been using on my dry hands for a week and already they look years younger!</li>
    <li> The Tocopheryl Acetate, causes much redness and rash when using. Put on my face bc have read vitamin E oil is good for face, and has made my face extremely swollen and red with rash under my eyes. I would never recommend this product and think it is grossly falsely advertised.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase. I used this product in a homemade face cream and had no issues. I rub it on a tiny scar I have on my face. It feels great and does it&#x27;s job :)</li>
    <li> Great.  I have been using for quite a while.  Was great that I can now buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin E oil I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing!  Feels wonderful on my skin.  I put it in all kinds of homemade products.  Awesome stuff!  I&#x27;ve used other brands and was disappointed.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> it product would have been good but it LEAKED ALL OVER THE OTHER STUFF THAT CAME WITH IT. problem is, it didn&#x27;t have a safety seal, which seems very odd to me. my front door step is still greasy from the product that leaked all over the box. very disappointed to know that the company didn&#x27;t use a safety seal on their product</li>
    <li> I use this with argon oil and I love it. I put in on my face at night before I go to bed. My skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and product is good has a nice fragrance. I have been using for a while and I will probably puchase again.</li>
    <li> The oil is okay, not as rich with vitamin E as I had hoped with sunflower and safflower oils the first ingredients.  It arrived with the lid not sealed and I had an oily mess everywhere.  I find it almost impossible to use the way it is packaged.  AOL told me to contact the vendor which I did with no success as they told me to contact AOL....I persisted with AOL and finally got a credit after many hours of frustration on the phone.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Worked great on a sun burn, I put it on my leg veins, smells wonderful, and helps with chapped skin.  I love using this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is great. Makes my skin sooo smooth and soft. It absorbes pretty quick too. So it doesn&#x27;t make me greasy.</li>
    <li> I used this vitamin E oil in my homemade hand lotion and it worked great. Highly recommend it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I made lotion bars and put the oil in them.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend. She likes it to take off her make up and says it works great.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  The smell is amazing and it moisturizers very well.  It&#x27;s a product I will keep ordering.</li>
    <li> I read about this in a magazine who recommended it for dry winter skin and dry scalp.  I have not used it on my scalp yet, but I have used it on my face, legs and cuticles and its really nice.  A little on the oily side, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot....but it has really helped with my ragged cuticles and itchy legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this on my pregnant belly to help prevent stretch marks.  So far so good and I&#x27;m 36 weeks pregnant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in a mixture of essential oils and have been very pleased.  I live in Kazakhstan which is very dry and arid and this helps my skin stay smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Skin Drys fast, Coco butter is better!</li>
    <li> From the Seller&#x27;s description I was under the impression it only contained Vitamin E oil, but there are several other ingredients. I have acne prone and very sensitive skin so I will not be able to try this product on my face, chest or back, but it works okay on my legs. I should have zoomed in on the picture, it shows on the bottle it contains five oils...</li>
    <li> The oil arrived on time and well packaged. I have several products from this company and I am always happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I use this in my essential oil hand wash blend, and it feels wonderful on my hands, which are dry!</li>
    <li> I really know that my skin was happy every time I put this thing, My acne scar feed out a little bit&lt;br /&gt;I would love to order this one more time, it it natural and safe!</li>
    <li> Good stuff!! Feels great in my soaps!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great--I was having very dry, flaky skin all over my face and eyelids from the winter weather, and every moisturizer I tried to use made my face burn. This oil did the trick...my face is no longer dry and flaky, but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily either (and I&#x27;m prone to acne, but so far haven&#x27;t had a problem with this). It also smells like almond extract (probably because it has some almond oil in it), which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY problem is that the oil spilled while being shipped. It arrived in a greasy box with probably about 20% missing from the bottle. Once I washed off the bottle of oil, it was fine, and not enough was lost to make it worth returning. It probably needs some sort of seal to make sure it doesn&#x27;t spill.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time.  It is true to size. I have only heard great things about Vitamin E use, so I ordered it to go in an oil blend I am making up to use on my hair.</li>
    <li> FOR THOSE INTERESTED, THE LISTED INGREDIENTS ARE:  Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil*, Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) See Oil*, TocoPheryl Acetate, Tochpherol, Oryza Sativa (Rice), Bran Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernal Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avacado) Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Lecithin.  *Certified Organic Ingredients.    As quoted: \\&quot;If you prefer all-natural supplements, you can tell the difference by checking the label. Products that contain vitamin E from natural sources will state that they contain d-alpha-tocopherol. Synthetic vitamin E is dl-alpha-tocopherol.\\&quot;  As you CAN SEE, NEITHER ARE LISTED IN THE INGREDIENTS OF THIS PRODUCT.  One REALLY DOES NEED TO RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING.    I will be finding a different vendor for my Vitamin E, too!    Read more:[...]</li>
    <li> I love it. Just wish it did not open in the box. I got to me just in time to close it.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for body moisturizer instead of using body moisturizer. I used regularly whenever I go to sauna three times a week.  I wish this has a bigger bottle so the price per ounce can be more cheaper/</li>
    <li> good moisturizer for my body and sometimes lips.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t dare use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;bought this for stretchmarks to use with a derma roller.&lt;br /&gt;Not a significant difference, I&#x27;m starting to lose hope for my stretchmarks on my hips.&lt;br /&gt;But nonetheless is a very good moisturizer and seems to have evened out my discoloration a little bit</li>
    <li> Wash your face with honey and apply this oil while your face is still damp.  It&#x27;s the best face you&#x27;ll ever have!  Seriously, I love the scent and properties of vitamin e oil and this one is great!</li>
    <li> This Vit E Oil is good, but not pure Vitamin E Oil. There are lots of other oils included.. Not what I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product that is super moisturizing. I bought this for some road rash and it was a great treatment option that really worked well to both heal and prevent scarring.</li>
    <li> I would have like it more if over half of it hadn&#x27;t spilled into the box :(</li>
    <li> Used to make a hand sanitizer gel.  Worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This arrived open and half the bottle poured out. Save your cash, go to the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> It turns out this product isn&#x27;t very natural. It has a load of ingredients that aren&#x27;t specified in the listing. The oil also has a really strong perfumed smell. It doesn&#x27;t work well and isn&#x27;t what it claims to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally hesitant to put pure oil on my skin as I have senstive skin and am prone to breakouts.  This oil doesn&#x27;t leave a residue (don&#x27;t go crazy with it though).  I can even use it on my face and not have a breakout.  It leaves the skin feeling nice and soft.  The scent is light and almond like.  I don&#x27;t normally like the smell of almonds, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Love the stuff.</li>
    <li> I used this oil along with other oils and shea butter as a moisturizer for my hair and skin.  I really love the mixture.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to help with hair moisture.  It works wonderfully and has a pleasant smell.  Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I am allergic to both almonds and apricots. This product is advertised as \\&quot;Pure vitamin E\\&quot; with no ingredients list. I take vitamin E and have used vitamin E oil before, and never have I seen one containing almond and apricot oils. I am SOOOO glad I read the ingredients. I almost didn&#x27;t, didn&#x27;t occur to me that I needed to, but as the bath was filing, I turned it around and read it. Just goes to show that one should always, always be careful when dealing with allergies. Needless to say, I&#x27;m relived that I read the ingredients and disappointed that this wasn&#x27;t listed anywhere on the Amazon site. Many people are allergic to nuts. This product is going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading that it was pure vitamin E oil, and that it was a pure food item. I was going to use it to create an all-natural lip product for children, so I was very upset to find out it was not pure vitamin E oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil contains many things which could be allergens (wheat, almond, apricot) plus on the bottle it says \\&quot;For external use only, keep out of the reach of children.\\&quot; Not exactly pure vitamin E now, is it? And certainly not a food product! I will not be purchasing products from the Jason company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would hope that Amazon would check into this and make them change their ingredients list to accurately reflect what is contained in this oil.</li>
    <li> The oil works great. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was seeking.  I was wanting to add some Vitamin E to my DIY skin/hair balms and oils.  This stuff smells so sweet, it&#x27;s great stuff...  and I&#x27;ve come to really like JASON products over the years.</li>
    <li> I order this for myself and like all my oils etc my husband and son used it.  Now they love it and I am now ordering it for them. :)</li>
    <li> Very healing! As soon as I used this stuff, I loved it. Makes my skin look amazing, smells good, and also warms up when you put it on.. (which is great for these winter months!) The only cons are: Takes a little while to absorb (wouldn&#x27;t suggest putting clothes on too quickly after applying) and I kind of wish I could get more for the price.. Great product :)</li>
    <li> Great quality and price.</li>
    <li> I use this a few times a week as a moisturizer for my face.  I love this way this smells.  If you are looking for pure Vitamin E oil however this is not the produce for you, it contains other oils in addition to vitamin E.  That being said I love the way it smells due to the addition of some almond oil.</li>
    <li> YAY!!! vitamin E I love this oil is great for your skin and your hair. I like the amount for the price, this will last me for over a month even longer. Receive it in a couple days, shipping was like 4 business day</li>
    <li> Great for healing a burn</li>
    <li> I usually use vitamin E for my face, I tried this product and it start burning like crazy even after I washed my face with lot of water I still could feel the burning sensation...Had to return it!</li>
    <li> The lid was not screwed on and so when I opened the box, oil was everywhere. I lost about a 1/4 of the bottle.</li>
    <li> if you are looking for straight Vit E oil, then this is not for you. The Almond Oil definitely had a presence. I use it to remove make up and for that, I love it.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it and when it arrived I was super happy.. I love the smell of it goes on easy leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.. So i  will be ordering more. :-)</li>
    <li> Smells great too! I love this product and highly recommend it! I am not sure about it helping with hair loss as touted, however, it is very healing to my skin.</li>
    <li> Bought for my face but have ended up using it for massage/after bath/body oil.  It is NOT 100% vitamin e but an oil blend, though a very nice blend with a nutty smell.  Warning: my cat goes nuts for this so I don&#x27;t dare leave it open (learned once - he knocked and spilled it) and have to keep it out of their reach.  Not sure if all cats are like mine ;-)  But for humans it&#x27;s a nice and soft oil, great for sensitive skin and will leave your body glowing.</li>
    <li> Great for  your skin and the smell is soooooooooooooooo good. It reminds me of a cake my mom used to bake.</li>
    <li> Alright so I just order this and it leaked every where through the box. I was so anxious opening it and i was surprise because it even had a zip baggy over it. Which didn&#x27;t do anything because it still leaked out because the lid wasn&#x27;t tightened all the way. So I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the packaging really annoyed me.</li>
    <li> Very plasent smell. i use it&lt;br /&gt;in lotion/hair carei wish it&lt;br /&gt;came in a 8 oz.&lt;br /&gt;will buy again .</li>
    <li> Great for your entire body after you shower. I mix mine with a little lavender oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells wonderful.  It has a great price and leaves you feeling silky smooth.  I use it right after showering after just patting myself a little dry.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use it for my eye lashes and brows.  Does help with length</li>
    <li> Great price, smells good . feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Works great. I&#x27;ll order more when i run out.</li>
    <li> This is probably my fault for not reading closer, ended up using it as a bath oil.  That worked well.</li>
    <li> Love this. It is suppose to help your skin stay younger, according to Dr. OZ. So far it has worked great on my skin.</li>
    <li> At my late 40&#x27;s I started seeing lines on my face that just wouldn&#x27;t go away due to age and dryness.  At first I  \\&quot;accepted\\&quot; it.  I would not go in for plastic surgery, etc.  I feel one should age gracefully.  As I turned 50 I found e-oil. I use it on my face and neck daily.  What a difference!!  I am now 62 and I constantly get comments on my skin and how I look younger than my age.  What fun.  The lines and jowls have vanished.  As with other reviewers, I use it on may hands daily, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a health food nut.  My philosophy is a little high grade Scotch and high quality chocolate daily will keep the body in good spirits. I started avoiding sugars, starches and fruit 5-6 years ago,(Scotch and chocolate don&#x27;t have sugar!!!). I lost 40 pounds, five pant sizes and have never looked back.  It too came off slowly, but as I have a family history of heart and diabetes problems I had to get the fat off my middle.  I eat whole grain bread, crackers, and pasta at home.  If I go out to dinner I eat whatever I want.  I have found that vitamins, minerals and many other supplements help my body retain its ability to deal with life.  I figure if I had a classic car I would maintain it as needed.  I think of my body the same way.  Find out what it needs and find out what works best for my body. High milage doesn&#x27;t have to be a problem. I am looking forward to another great 20-30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have found with E oil is the more I.U.&#x27;s it has the thicker it gets.  The Jason 5,ooo I.U.&#x27;s is just right.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately there is quite a bit more than vitamin e oil in this product. A LOT more. For example, sunflower oil? I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but this made me break out horribly and gave me a nasty case of hives. You&#x27;re much better off buying vitamin e oil at Trader Joe&#x27;s, they sell a 4 oz bottle for $3.99, and it has much fewer extra ingredients.</li>
    <li> I bought b/c I wanted 100% E oil, but I figured I&#x27;d try this out anyway. So glad I did. 1st ingredient(sunflower oil), as well as a few others are the same as Weleda Skin Food, which I love. This is great stuff, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference after a week or so. I have tried a LOT of skin care products and I do think this one does it better than really expensive creams. I have acne prone dry skin, concerns about aging and wrinkles(I&#x27;m 37). I use it on face, eyes, neck, hands, elbows. as long as I have a very clean face and hands when applying, then this seems to not cause any acne. it is rather thick, but I like that, b/c other oils (coconut, olive, jojoba etc) alone are not thick enough to keep my face moisturized through the night. (very dry air!) anyhow this is awesome b/c I was spending so much trying to find the right creams/ lotions...i was going to try to make my own, but I think I may have found my answer...if I have any further issues w/ this stuff I&#x27;ll update! Oh--PS it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any questionable ingredients (no parabens or preservatives, etc)--although the E oil is synthetic, apparently.</li>
    <li> Put this on your pet chicken and roll her around in a mix if sand and compost - just kidding we actually make liquid soap but needed to write at least 19 words for review - sorry</li>
    <li> Nice smell. I am pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> VERY NICE, AND IT GOT HERE QUICKLY!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful! I love the smell of it too! It moisturize my skin perfectly, and you only need a little bit for a large portion of the body.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, this oil smells great.</li>
    <li> Greasy, smells like almonds, but absorbs pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it on our face and any scars after bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real complaint is my little girls hair gets stringy/oily around her face after putting it on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent, though.  Like sweet almonds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying it again.  Can tell a difference in just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This feels great on my face and body and it smells like sweet almonds. I love it. I would recommend it to anyone with dry flaky skin.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells absolutely amazing. I use it as a face moisturizer, as a hair oil, in homemade cosmetics. I would recommend this too my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I like the  product.  Shipped to me very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great price, for this excellent product.  A little goes a long way, no need to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; open a pill.  I use in homemade lotions. promotes healing, great antioxidant, great for skin care-does not clog pores.  It helps deter premature aging.  I recommend this product.  Arrived fast.</li>
    <li> STILL USE IT TODAY DAILY AT NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP. GOOD FOR THE SKIN ***** ** ** **</li>
    <li> Not sure how it was as it leaked all over the bag it was in and the box with two other things which were &amp;#34;oiled up,&amp;#34; too.  Never took it out of the bag - just returned it as is.</li>
    <li> Adding this to my routine in the winter saved my lips and face from chapping/cracking!</li>
    <li> It is Oil for the skin.</li>
    <li> Very sticky texture and hard to wash off.</li>
    <li> The oil is rich and is absorbed quickly. I don&#x27;t like the smell though, because it smells very much like almonds, which is an ingredient (I don&#x27;t like AMARETTO, too). So if you like almondy scents, this is a perfect oil!</li>
    <li> The oil is nice and smells great, but the cap was not tightened before shipping. I lost about a quarter of the bottle in shipping.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> just wanted Vitamin E. oil and got all this extra stuff.. i am not impressed. they need to stop with this extra stuff.</li>
    <li> By far the best Vitamin E product Ive bought in a long time! Quality vs price is great! Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Very good for my scalp and skin. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Product was fine but it had leaked all through the packaging.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. The smell is sweet and very pleasant. It is smooth and soaks in very nicely, a little goes a long way. This is perfect for areas you need to repair from either being damaged by dryness or is sensitive to lotions and their thickness. I have even used this on the heels of my feet and saw the softness return within days.</li>
    <li> FAST DELIVERY  WORKS WELL</li>
    <li> product came in plastic Will order this product again great product.</li>
    <li> Oops! I had to send it back. It leaked all over the box during delivery. It wasn&#x27;t properly sealed. Don&#x27;t trust packaging that may be have a broken seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this products&#x27; Vitamin E is derived from wheat germ. Just a warning to anyone with allergies who doesn&#x27;t read the ingredients list in the description.</li>
    <li> very nice, works well</li>
    <li> This is great. I use it in the winter when my skin really dries out.  I rub it into my hands and fingers, and then lightly over my face, especially if I will be around the wood stove or outside int he cold.  My skin stays soft and retains moisture.</li>
</ol>
