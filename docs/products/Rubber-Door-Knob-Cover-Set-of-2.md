      <li>I can sleep better knowing that emergency egress is possible.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>

      <li>Thanks for shipping so fast!</li>
      <li>Comes fast and looks and works as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Very please with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the pattern, but it&#x27;s better than the oven mitt we had on the knob previously to prevent the refrigerator door from scratching when it smacks into it.</li>
      <li>These covers are super at acting as a bumper to that my bedroom door doesn&#x27;t bang into my closet door--</li>
      <li>highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>Needless to say, they look great as well.</li>

      <li>Gave good protection to knob and wall behind door.</li>

      <li>We have a 102 year old house with shiny brass doorknobs.  </li>
      <li>Had to make small slit in  rim to get them to fit but were tight and secure when installed.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>Great instead of the ugly door stops.</li>
      <li>These should be advertised in Old House Journal and similar magazines.  </li>
      <li>They were purchased as padding on a door knob that my refrigerator door  bangs into every time the door is opened if the door is not carefully opened.  </li>
      <li>door knobs were turning green underneath the 35 year old covers, when I discovered these exact replacements available!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>Priced right and received them in a few days.</li>
      <li>If you have to open a door quickly while your hands are wet, these help to turn the knob without slipping.</li>
      <li>Also, a major plus is that they help make the doors easier to open for anyone who has arthritis in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>Easy to use knob underneath and protects glass door behind it well</li>
      <li>I wished it was a little tight fit.</li>

<li> I am not sure the rubber cover is  going to help prevent the denting of my refrigerator door because the door knob cover is a hard rubber, but  the pantry door is certainly easy to open with wet hands.  </li>
<li> a long time.&lt;br</li>
<li> The fit is a little awkward and doesn&#x27;t cover as much of the doorknob as expected,</li>
<li> Wish that this came in different colors/styles (and maybe it does, just didn&#x27;t not see other options online).</li>
<li> they had a small hole for a key as I&#x27;d put them on my front and back doors.</li>
<li> needed it now for my house and the door coming into house from garage which has a very slippery brass knob and at times it was next to impossible to turn.  </li>
<li> This was money well spent!!</li>
<li> Very hard to find and just like I remember them - same print.  </li>
<li> If for some reason someone has a problem opening a door with round door knobs</li>
<li> They hold on to the door knob, which helps an older member of our household, but they do get a little dirty.</li>
<li> Size a bit small for my doorknobs.  </li>
<li> The cover just fits half of the door knob, still making it difficult to grab.</li>
<li> poor planning on the builders part.</li>
<li> not good when it is cold in winter</li>
<li> Ugly, but functional.</li>

    <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.  And, it does the job that I was looking for it to do. Very pleased</li>
    <li> These covers are super at acting as a bumper to that my bedroom door doesn&#x27;t bang into my closet door--poor planning on the builders part. But these take care of a thoughtless act by the original builder. Also, a major plus is that they help make the doors easier to open for anyone who has arthritis in their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had a small hole for a key as I&#x27;d put them on my front and back doors.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Thanks for shipping so fast!</li>
    <li> Terrific solution for our doors. Attractive</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and is a nice cushion for door knob, it softens the bang to the wall behind.</li>
    <li> They were delivered in a timely manner and perfect for what we needed!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my doorknob.</li>
    <li> OUTSTANDING SERVICE WITH AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT TO FILL A REQUIREMENT  THANKS</li>
    <li> I had to give this 5 stars for even existing. I don&#x27;t like the pattern, but it&#x27;s better than the oven mitt we had on the knob previously to prevent the refrigerator door from scratching when it smacks into it. And it&#x27;s the only product I could find that wasn&#x27;t meant to keep a baby from opening a door.</li>
    <li> I like these because they are the only ones that did not have a children&#x27;s theme to them.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping holes out of wall from doorknobs. Great instead of the ugly door stops.</li>
    <li> They are great for an old house!</li>
    <li> I needed a cover for my door knob so it wouldn&#x27;t bang against my dryer. This is just what I needed!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use knob underneath and protects glass door behind it well</li>
    <li> Beautiful product.  Easy to install.  Great solution.</li>
    <li> Comes fast and looks and works as advertised.  I just wish there were additional styles.</li>
    <li> Wish there were updated styles, but they are exactly what I was looking for!  Very hard to find and just like I remember them - same print.  Oh well, does the job.</li>
    <li> They work great. They hold on to the door knob, which helps an older member of our household, but they do get a little dirty. Haven&#x27;t tried to clean them yet. Another nice feature is if you have  a problem with a door that can be opened too far to where it bumps/dents another surface, these covers will help prevent that.</li>
    <li> These are great!  Put them on the closet doors that always seem to hit into the wall and damage it.  Problem solved!  Now if they make it to the wall, they don&#x27;t damage my paint!  Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Ugly, but functional.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to cover the knob on our bathroom door so that it doesn&#x27;t scratch the washing machine (it hits the machine when the door is all the way open).&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Successfully prevents scratches to my new washing machine as hoped.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The fit is a little awkward and doesn&#x27;t cover as much of the doorknob as expected, Wish that this came in different colors/styles (and maybe it does, just didn&#x27;t not see other options online).</li>
    <li> These door know covers work perfectly where I wanted them, and look very nice.</li>
    <li> They are great!  They fit on my door knob just perfectly. They&#x27;re very pretty &amp; I&#x27;m ordering another set  today!</li>
    <li> It is ugliest door knob cover set I ever saw but it is doing the job.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly in good condition. Nice product, seems to be durable. Size a bit small for my doorknobs.  Had to make small slit in  rim to get them to fit but were tight and secure when installed. Gave good protection to knob and wall behind door.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Rubber door knob covers are hard to find, especially pretty ones. Priced right and received them in a few days. love them</li>
    <li> The cover just fits half of the door knob, still making it difficult to grab. Would not recommend this cover to my friends.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I wanted! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The paint was continually being rubbed off by hands being placed on the arm knobs of our captain chairs.  The rubber door knobs fit over them perfectly.  Solved our problem!</li>
    <li> These covers do the job of protecting the paint, but could fit a little better. Maybe two different styles for the different door knobs.</li>
    <li> Very please with my purchase. I plan to order a few more 😊. Good purchase &amp; highly recommend to others</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4 star because they are rather unattractive.  It does work well, though.</li>
    <li> We have a 102 year old house with shiny brass doorknobs.  These covers are a SAFETY item since they make opening the doors easy with arthritic hands.  They are a must. I can sleep better knowing that emergency egress is possible.  These should be advertised in Old House Journal and similar magazines.  This was money well spent!!</li>
    <li> These were probably left over from my parents&#x27; time.&lt;br /&gt;My door knobs were turning green underneath the 35 year old covers, when I discovered these exact replacements available!&lt;br /&gt;They fit perfectly on our 60 year old coop (brass?) closet door knobs.</li>
    <li> these are great.  same as when i was a kid and had one on my bedroom doorknob.  needed it now for my house and the door coming into house from garage which has a very slippery brass knob and at times it was next to impossible to turn.  not good when it is cold in winter and you can&#x27;t get in house.  these are still great.  hardware store said they didn&#x27;t exist.</li>
    <li> The rubber door knob cover set looked like the picture posted and were as the description written.  They were purchased as padding on a door knob that my refrigerator door  bangs into every time the door is opened if the door is not carefully opened.  I am not sure the rubber cover is  going to help prevent the denting of my refrigerator door because the door knob cover is a hard rubber, but  the pantry door is certainly easy to open with wet hands.  If for some reason someone has a problem opening a door with round door knobs this is an effective and decorative solution.</li>
    <li> My mom had these and they were great for helping someone with arthritis turn a doorknob. If you have to open a door quickly while your hands are wet, these help to turn the knob without slipping. Needless to say, they look great as well.</li>
    <li> OK product. the only one I found so I ordered it. Protects clothes washer door from getting marred when they swing into the door knobs</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.  First of all just to find it.  I lookid on line a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It fit very well and also has a nice appearance.  It stops the door from hitting my refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.  A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice door knob covers. I wished it was a little tight fit.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love them!</li>
    <li> I looked in stores throughout the Twin Cities and could not fin anything that worked as well as these.</li>
