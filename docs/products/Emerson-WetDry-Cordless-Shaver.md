### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say its the best shaver out there.</li>
      <li>He says he loves it and is very happy with all the features.</li>
      <li>Does a great job!</li>
      <li>Emerson is a very good name at a lower price.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Oh it buzzed and sounded great, but when I put it to my face...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with</li>
      <li>and it did a great job.</li>
      <li>I must say it works great for my face and beard.  </li>
      <li>I must have the perfect beard for this Emerson razor because I like it better than using shave cream and triple or quad blade razors in the morning.</li>
      <li>My husband loved it.</li>
      <li>and then it wasn&#x27;t a good close</li>
      <li>He loved it and cared for it like a baby.  </li>
      <li>you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer any or all of them.</li>
      <li>and he is very satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I turn the razor on and hear the kind of buzzing you&#x27;d expect...put it on my face and it SOUNDS like it&#x27;s doing something -</li>
      <li>/&gt;The pop-up clipper is marginally effective.</li>
      <li>The guy who said it would be more effective to rub your face against tree bark?</li>
      <li>More junk from China.</li>
      <li>Will it outdo a unit from Braun or Norelco costing a hundred bucks more?  </li>
      <li>just glad I found it on here</li>
      <li>Use it more than once and you will see.  </li>
      <li>DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR, YOU&#x27;LL LOSE MORE MONEY THAN HAIR.</li>
      <li>would not cut through my beard at all, wirked ok on wifes legs but would pull hair alot</li>
      <li>I found a couple stubbles, nothing more.</li>
      <li>it ended up costing me 25 more dollers</li>
      <li>is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, regarding the unit itself, as most folks (with an IQ of 100 or more) will tell you, this unit works as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased with the similarity, since I was already used to that shaver, and I had pretty good results with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The box also says \\&quot;Wet/dry operation for easy cleaning\\&quot;.     </li>
      <li>Strongly discourage anyone from buying this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;and gong strong.</li>
      <li>and it is still running strong.</li>
      <li>The product was fine, however when they shipped the product, they charged me postage on every piece I ordered.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The cheap price makes up for a lot,</li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been interesting to sit in on Emerson&#x27;s marketing staff meeting to determine if this was a product worth selling, and who would buy it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I get compliments from my lady that my face is smooth</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean, and recharge.</li>
      <li>The buzzing sound wakes me up and the razor does the job.</li>
      <li>When you spend as much on your electric razor as you would on a happy meal, I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much.  </li>
      <li>just finished shaving with it with the original factory</li>
      <li>It gave a smooth quiet shave, No nicks or cuts,it does not pull into the skin, it is  easy to hold, light weight, Very easy to clean and if needed the blade head comes easily off if we ever need a replacement.</li>
      <li>Trimmer works, but the main shaver...which is the most important part of this device does not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>If you are on a budget, you really cant get any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This razor lasted about 15minutes on a full charge.</li>
      <li>and It gives an fairly adequate shave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I brought this shaver camping for quick cleanup and am throwing it in the trash-</li>
      <li>It turns on and makes the sound like it&#x27;s ready to cut, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>but for the price ,it is worth it.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s right.</li>
      <li>Rather than running on a rechargable AA like my original shaver, or a pair of replaceable AAs like my latest shaver, the Emerson version contains a single 3/5 AA ni-cd cell.</li>
      <li>I shave everyday and it is perfect for use the next day after 1 day of growth.</li>
      <li>When we got the second and charged it up (red light charger does not light)we thought OK this will be a piece of junk!</li>
      <li>When I first got it</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe this company is actually trying to sell it for more online, where people will also be paying shipping and handling.</li>
      <li>But the bottom line for me is that it actually shaves better -- closer and faster -- than any of them.  </li>
      <li>I just used this thing on my face for the first time and it feels like someone took a blowtorch to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad it was only an $8 risk.  </li>
      <li>I fully charged this shaver before first use.</li>
      <li>I give it a solid 5 stars because it is not expensive and that it works for me !!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Based on the cheap price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of the Emerson, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>and I obviously look good for work in my financial office.</li>
      <li>None of the above brands ever gave me a quick, clean shave the way</li>
      <li>Interestingly, the screen and blade used by this shaver are nearly identical to the screens used by my old shaver, which was a rechargeable version of this:</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a bit confounded by the positive reviews on this piece of garbage.</li>
      <li>It also has a pretty good battery -fairly long lasting.</li>
      <li>to the owners of items like this please make sure that your productes were not returns from others as that makes them NOT NEW.</li>
      <li>I really tried with this little machine...a good twenty minutes, whereas shaving with a normal manual razor takes me 5 minutes, tops.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll certainly get the information they want.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re not risking much moolah.ser and faster -- than any of them.  </li>
      <li>This shaver is really inexpensive for a reason, while it makes noise and charges/recharges - it doesn&#x27;t shave at all well.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re not risking much moolah.</li>
      <li>I could use it on days when I notice that I need to shave but don&#x27;t have the time for lather and the whole 9 yards...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this is working for some people, it really just didn&#x27;t do anything for me but pull my hair.</li>
      <li>No, but do you really expect it to?  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m unsure when torture devices became legal, but this Emerson shaver is on par with the Iron Maiden or Waterboarding.  </li>
      <li>The shaver works fine (in or out of the shower) so long as you are using it on DC power (batteries), which is why it&#x27;s called a cordless shaver.  </li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s held up pretty well with the water.</li>
      <li>However, the fine print on the box says, \\&quot;To avoid the risk of fire, burns, personal injury, and electric shock, do not place clippers near water</li>
      <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve used Panasonics, Brauns, Remingtons, and even Norelcos, although I quickly found that the rotary design simply doesn&#x27;t work for me, at all.  </li>
      <li>just tried my new shaver</li>
      <li>My husband enjoys shaving with his new Emerson.  </li>
      <li>The only issue we had with it was that the first one sent did not work.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to all groups; men young and up in age!</li>
      <li>it did a Fantastic Job shaving a TOUGH beard on a VERY sensitive face and left the face EXTREMELY Smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>since it&#x27;s not just a little cheaper than the big makes, it&#x27;s one-tenth as much in many cases.  </li>
      <li>Either you can safely get it wet, or you will be electrocuted if you get it wet, but it cannot be both.</li>
      <li>Even though I charged this razor overnight, I can&#x27;t even complete a shave without it losing power.  </li>
      <li>What else can a say to encourage you to not waste your money on this product?</li>
      <li>The shaver will not cut two days&#x27; growth evenly, and no amount of rotating action, change in skin tightness, change in skin shape or contour will do anything to change that.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;fully agree with the most negative of the reviews.</li>
      <li>I can press it up to my face and go back and forth as much as I want and no hair gets shaved.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 18 yrs old</li>
      <li>I owned several and was pretty satisfied at first, but found that as they grew more complicated and the price climbed ever higher, their performance got worse, until I threw my last one in the trash out of frustration and began looking alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I say this doesn&#x27;t work, I mean you would be better off scraping your face with a credit card.</li>
      <li>but this shaver is great for a person who just started shaving alot it seems to work better with thin hair if your beard or mustache is thick consider using clippers to trim down before shaving with this shaver</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly a great backup unit (for work or travel), as I&#x27;d be mad as #</li>
      <li>well I&#x27;ve had it charging for 3 days and the light has not changed from red to green yet nor will it start.</li>
      <li>When mine run down, I plug them in, leave them overnight, then unplug them, and that seems to be about the right amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was rated as fairly decent simply for the quality of the actual shave by Consumer Reports (</li>
      <li>I have an extremely light beard, such that I can usually get away with shaving once every three days or so.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had one of these for years and couldn&#x27;t find another 1 in the stores just glad I found it on here</li>
    <li> This product was bought for a gentleman I know. This is the only electric shaver he will buy.. I bought 2 so he would have a spare. Great product.</li>
    <li> First, let&#x27;s clear up an issue with some folks writing negative reviews about this product (as it relates to the wet/dry claim).  The shaver works fine (in or out of the shower) so long as you are using it on DC power (batteries), which is why it&#x27;s called a cordless shaver.  Only an idiot would stand in the shower and try to shave with ANY shaver plugged into 110V AC power, that includes this unit (which is why Emerson states their warnings about using it plugged in).  Honestly how some reviewers on Amazon downgrade their reviews on a product because the manufacturer is forced to remind idiots about safety is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, regarding the unit itself, as most folks (with an IQ of 100 or more) will tell you, this unit works as advertised.  For the money, it&#x27;s hard to beat.  Will it outdo a unit from Braun or Norelco costing a hundred bucks more?  No, but do you really expect it to?  For the price, it&#x27;s really hard to beat.  It&#x27;s certainly a great backup unit (for work or travel), as I&#x27;d be mad as #$*^ if I left my expensive unit sitting in a hotel room, but if this one got accidentally left behind it wouldn&#x27;t cause me to panic.</li>
    <li> Do not buy it. Got one for Christmas this year and it does NOT work. I can press it up to my face and go back and forth as much as I want and no hair gets shaved. Facial hair is less than half an inch long, nothing a decent shaver couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
    <li> The only issue we had with it was that the first one sent did not work. When we got the second and charged it up (red light charger does not light)we thought OK this will be a piece of junk! BUT&lt;br /&gt;it was NOT! We use a PRE electric shave lotion prior to shaving. It gave a smooth quiet shave, No nicks or cuts,it does not pull into the skin, it is  easy to hold, light weight, Very easy to clean and if needed the blade head comes easily off if we ever need a replacement. We are NOT using it in a shower so we cannot tell you how waterproof it is or is not. Bottom Line for Less than $20.00 it did a Fantastic Job shaving a TOUGH beard on a VERY sensitive face and left the face EXTREMELY Smooth and soft. We would NOT hesitate buying another as a reserve shaver if it goes on sale again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a closer shave than my Norelco dry shaver.  I fully charged this shaver before first use. Even then it was sluggish. And performance went downhill from there. I found that I had to charge it before each use.  If not, the shaver did poorly... like flogging my ancient grandfather.</li>
    <li> This was rated as fairly decent simply for the quality of the actual shave by Consumer Reports (no bells/whistles)...and I thought for the amount I paid for it, it couldn&#x27;t hurt. Well, this shaver has no bells and whistles nor does it shave.  At all.  It&#x27;s worthless.  Don&#x27;t buy...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m unsure when torture devices became legal, but this Emerson shaver is on par with the Iron Maiden or Waterboarding.  In fact, I heard the CIA recently signed a contract with Emerson to purchase 5 million of these shavers, undoubtedly to use as interrogation devices.  They&#x27;ll certainly get the information they want.  This was purchased for me from CVS by my mother, who had grown tired of my NHL playoff beard for the NY Rangers.  She appeared to never care much for hockey, but judging by what this razor had done, she must clearly be a secret Capitals fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it negative stars if possible, but Amazon requires at least a 1.</li>
    <li> As the title state, the shaver will not charge at all.  I have contacted the seller without any response whatsoever.</li>
    <li> The razor on the backside  (the trimmer I think it&#x27;s supposed to be) doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I just used this thing on my face for the first time and it feels like someone took a blowtorch to it. So far, it&#x27;s held up pretty well with the water.</li>
    <li> Even though I charged this razor overnight, I can&#x27;t even complete a shave without it losing power.  The razor just doesn&#x27;t work after several passes. A complete waste of money.....</li>
    <li> I actually bought this razor at a CVS for ten dollars, I stupidly thought was a great deal . The reason I&#x27;m on Amazon complaining about it is that I came on here to see if anyone else was having problems using this razor. When I read the other reviews, I knew it wasn&#x27;t just me.  This razor does not shave. I mean that in the literal sense that when I put this against my face, absolutely no hair was removed. I am firmly convinced that the extremely few little specks of hair I did see fall were a result of the hairs getting stuck in the mesh and pulled out, which is entirely possible because I honestly pushed it against my face with all my might.  It was a scam at $10, so I can&#x27;t believe this company is actually trying to sell it for more online, where people will also be paying shipping and handling. That is why I&#x27;m writing this, so that no one else wastes their money. DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR, YOU&#x27;LL LOSE MORE MONEY THAN HAIR.</li>
    <li> Got mine today. \\&quot;rechargeable wet/dry cordless shaver\\&quot; is repeated all over the box. A photo of the shaver being held under running water on the box. The box also says \\&quot;Wet/dry operation for easy cleaning\\&quot;.     However, the fine print on the box says, \\&quot;To avoid the risk of fire, burns, personal injury, and electric shock, do not place clippers near water...\\&quot;     The instructions also refer to it as \\&quot;WET/DRY SHAVER\\&quot; and has a different photo of the shaver being held under what looks like the same sink&#x27;s running water. The cleaning instructions say to \\&quot;Rinse the shaver and trimmer under running water...\\&quot; and have a drawing of the shaver under a faucet with water flowing.     Then under Safety Information, it says, \\&quot;Do NOT immerse the shaver in water or any other liquid\\&quot; and has a drawing of the shaver with water sprinkling down on it with a big gray X across it.     SO WHICH IS IT?!?!? Either you can safely get it wet, or you will be electrocuted if you get it wet, but it cannot be both.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 18 yrs old which is a age not very much respected when it comes to these topics but this shaver is great for a person who just started shaving alot it seems to work better with thin hair if your beard or mustache is thick consider using clippers to trim down before shaving with this shaver</li>
    <li> Like a lot of the other reviewers said, it doesn&#x27;t work. It turns on and makes the sound like it&#x27;s ready to cut, but it doesn&#x27;t. When I first got it I went over the side of my face about 30 times at a bunch of different angles -- it still looked the same as the other side. I don&#x27;t know how this is working for some people, it really just didn&#x27;t do anything for me but pull my hair.</li>
    <li> This razor lasted about 15minutes on a full charge. The flip up part is almost useless for trimming a beard since it constantly snags hairs. This has to be the worst/most painful shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> Trimmer works, but the main shaver...which is the most important part of this device does not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like this is a hit or miss product and I definitely got a miss.</li>
    <li> I Bought this shaver for my 16 yr old son as a Christmas gift, PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your money I spent 14 dollars(luckily that was all) and it doesn&#x27;t even charge. My son came to me and said it didn&#x27;t work, I figured he was doing something wrong , well I&#x27;ve had it charging for 3 days and the light has not changed from red to green yet nor will it start. Don&#x27;t waste your money do your homework first.</li>
    <li> I thought something was wrong with this razor....seemed to be built well, battery had nice life but this would not shave even a Red Sox player.  More junk from China.</li>
    <li> I got it for the price and value. Emerson is a very good name at a lower price. My husband loved it. He has to shave twice a day and this really cut down the time. He says he loves it and is very happy with all the features.</li>
    <li> Sorry Amazon and Emerson...it does not do the job...I am back to using NAIR....I was very disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my father.  He loved it and cared for it like a baby.  Unfortunately I lost my father recently, but I will never forget his face when I presented him with this shaver.</li>
    <li> This. Is. Utterly. Useless. I have an extremely light beard, such that I can usually get away with shaving once every three days or so. I bought this thinking I could use it on days when I notice that I need to shave but don&#x27;t have the time for lather and the whole 9 yards...boy, was I mistaken. You know something is wrong when the one-star reviews are double the amount of 5 star reviews. The guy who said it would be more effective to rub your face against tree bark? He&#x27;s right. I turn the razor on and hear the kind of buzzing you&#x27;d expect...put it on my face and it SOUNDS like it&#x27;s doing something - but after 10 minutes of patiently running it over my beard, I can&#x27;t feel a bit of difference. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Why I got this as a gift I&#x27;ll never know, but having tried it anyway, I&lt;br /&gt;fully agree with the most negative of the reviews. Anyone claiming to&lt;br /&gt;actually shave with this surly doesn&#x27;t have a beard.&lt;br /&gt;Why a company like Emerson would put this \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; on the market is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been interesting to sit in on Emerson&#x27;s marketing staff meeting to determine if this was a product worth selling, and who would buy it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must show a rating. Too bad there&#x27;s no negative stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit confounded by the positive reviews on this piece of garbage. I saw it for $8 (not on Amazon) and figured it was probably useless, but took the risk. I&#x27;m really glad it was only an $8 risk.  When I say this doesn&#x27;t work, I don&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work well. That would imply that it shaves at least a little bit.   I brought this home, let it charge all the way, tried it out. Nothing. Oh it buzzed and sounded great, but when I put it to my face... nothing. After a few tries, I took it apart to see if there was any evidence of facial hair removal, because there was certainly no evidence on my face. I found a couple stubbles, nothing more. I tried it again the next day after seeing these reviews. Maybe I was just crazy and it would suddenly work. Nope. When you spend as much on your electric razor as you would on a happy meal, I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much.  When I say this doesn&#x27;t work, I mean you would be better off scraping your face with a credit card.</li>
    <li> I must have the perfect beard for this Emerson razor because I like it better than using shave cream and triple or quad blade razors in the morning. I have not used it wet yet; only on dry skin.  I must say it works great for my face and beard.  I shave everyday and it is perfect for use the next day after 1 day of growth. Just move in various directions up and down and left and right with the wide side or horizontally with the narrow sides as across the chin cleft. It works for me. Use it more than once and you will see.  The buzzing sound wakes me up and the razor does the job. I get compliments from my lady that my face is smooth and I obviously look good for work in my financial office. I also use the pop up sideburn blade to trim sideburns and the bottom edge of the mustache.  I got this as a stocking stuffer gift and now I looked it up online and will be buying a second one for visits and travel.  I give it a solid 5 stars because it is not expensive and that it works for me !!!</li>
    <li> My sixteen-year-old son received this as a gift from his well-meaning mother, and told me it didn&#x27;t work. I figured he was doing something wrong, and tried it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: rubbing your chin against a tree bark would probably be faster, and yield a closer shave. I really tried with this little machine...a good twenty minutes, whereas shaving with a normal manual razor takes me 5 minutes, tops. Over and over the same area, stretching my skin taut, trying to help it along...I think the razor was cutting one whisker at a time, about a tenth of a millimeter with each pass.&lt;br /&gt;The little pop-up beard trimmer was no better.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say its the best shaver out there.,  but for the price ,it is worth it. It does work. I have used it  before while traveling and It gives an fairly adequate shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only it is wet dry, but its rechargeable.It also has a pretty good battery -fairly long lasting.If you are on a budget, you really cant get any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer any or all of them.</li>
    <li> This little shaver works fine if you are a woman who only needs to shave a few chin hairs off. I cut myself with a disposable razor, and then turned to this shaver. It does the job well, but I can&#x27;t vouch for shaving a man&#x27;s beard. It is easy to clean, and recharge. I am getting electrolysis soon, and had to stop tweezing hairs. I am looking for another one for my daughter, but since I paid about half of the price here, I will look at our local department stores for sales.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I bought a different ten-dollar shaver at Walgreens, and it finally failed, so I went back and found this Emerson shaver for a similar price. Interestingly, the screen and blade used by this shaver are nearly identical to the screens used by my old shaver, which was a rechargeable version of this: http://www.amazon.com/Reflex-Trimmer-Cordless-Electric-Travel/dp/B006BDBUK4 (I&#x27;ve since bought one of those) I was pleased with the similarity, since I was already used to that shaver, and I had pretty good results with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this Emerson version is much worse because it is very underpowered. Rather than running on a rechargable AA like my original shaver, or a pair of replaceable AAs like my latest shaver, the Emerson version contains a single 3/5 AA ni-cd cell. That is a battery the same size around as a standard AA battery, but only three-fifths the length. This probably explains why the motor runs so slow and the shaver doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up clipper is marginally effective. I have standalone clippers that I start with whenever I skip a few days, so I only use the pop-up clipper if I find I&#x27;ve missed a spot and don&#x27;t want to switch back to the regular clippers. They work, but sometimes it takes a few tries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start out by pointing out that shaving is a very individual thing, so what works for one guy frequently won&#x27;t for another.  That&#x27;s why you get wildly different reviews of the same shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of this Emerson.  Over the years I&#x27;ve used Panasonics, Brauns, Remingtons, and even Norelcos, although I quickly found that the rotary design simply doesn&#x27;t work for me, at all.  None of the above brands ever gave me a quick, clean shave the way their advertising promises, but I came closest with Panasonic. I owned several and was pretty satisfied at first, but found that as they grew more complicated and the price climbed ever higher, their performance got worse, until I threw my last one in the trash out of frustration and began looking alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the cheap price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of the Emerson, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It shaves quicker and closer than any of the high-priced, heavily advertised competition, and while it lacks some of their features, it costs a fraction as much.  For example, it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator to show when you&#x27;re running out of charge, but the way I handled that was to buy two and use them in rotation.  Also, they don&#x27;t seem to be protected against overcharging, so don&#x27;t leave one plugged in indefinitely.  When mine run down, I plug them in, leave them overnight, then unplug them, and that seems to be about the right amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution: quality control is not high, so there&#x27;s a lot of sample variation. Also, the blades wear out before the motor and battery do, and Emerson apparently doesn&#x27;t sell replacements.  But in the other hand, the whole shaver costs half as much as the replacement blades used to for my Panasonic, so I just buy a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheap price makes up for a lot, since it&#x27;s not just a little cheaper than the big makes, it&#x27;s one-tenth as much in many cases.  But the bottom line for me is that it actually shaves better -- closer and faster -- than any of them.  Give it a try; you may like it and you&#x27;re not risking much moolah.ser and faster -- than any of them.  Give it a try; you may like it and you&#x27;re not risking much moolah.</li>
    <li> this product was not a new item like it had been discribed, it had hair from someone else in it i wanted to keep the item though so i had it cleaned by a pro. it ended up costing me 25 more dollers then it should have but ill live i guess. to the owners of items like this please make sure that your productes were not returns from others as that makes them NOT NEW.</li>
    <li> SInce the moment I received this item did not work. I opened it and jus did not cut. The blades seem to be made of plastic and the worst quality ever. Just do not buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband because he was unable to find it in the small community we have relocated to and he is very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I just bought an Emerson rechargeable, wet/dry  cordless shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a cord if you don&#x27;t want to run on battery alone.&lt;br /&gt;I just returned a Norelco shaver I paid $90.for . It took forever&lt;br /&gt;to shave and then it wasn&#x27;t a good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried my new shaver and it did a great job. I&#x27;m perfectly&lt;br /&gt;happy with it. I paid 9.95 for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just finished shaving with it with the original factory charge.&lt;br /&gt;After I finished I set the shaver on the table with the motor&lt;br /&gt;running and it hasn&#x27;t even slowed down yet and it&#x27;s been35 minutes&lt;br /&gt;and gong strong. I don&#x27;t know why all the complaints. I&#x27;m happy with&lt;br /&gt;it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over an hour now and it is still running strong. I&#x27;m not&lt;br /&gt;kidding I tell the truth.</li>
    <li> I did not purchase this a Amazon of it would be already returned.&lt;br /&gt;If I shave with my other shaver before I use this shaver it only bogs down a little. But if not it stops as soon as it hits whiskers. (yes it&#x27;s fully charged)&lt;br /&gt;Summary; If i have to shave before i use it whats it for??? A total waist of money. I&#x27;d like to return it but Emerson has hidden behind a smoke screen of websites. I&#x27;d also like to give it less than 1 star but the system won&#x27;t let be.</li>
    <li> My husband was given one for Christmas 2 years ago, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since he didn&#x27;t like it and I know my leg hairs should&#x27;nt be as touch as his face but it won&#x27;t even shave them. This might be one of the lemons but it&#x27;s a sorry piece of crap in my opinion! I had to click a star to get this to post but I&#x27;d give it -5 instead of even 1 star.</li>
    <li> Flat out useless.  It was a wasted $10.00 plus tax.  It is a product that Emerson should be ashamed of putting on the market.  What else can a say to encourage you to not waste your money on this product?</li>
    <li> Bought from CVS for $9.99. The product doesn&#x27;t work. It turns on but it doesn&#x27;t shave. Strongly discourage anyone from buying this.</li>
    <li> This shaver is really inexpensive for a reason, while it makes noise and charges/recharges - it doesn&#x27;t shave at all well.  I have a normal beard - not too heavy and not too course, and not light, spotty or thin either.  After using this shaver for an hour between last night and this morning, I now have a thoroughly irritated face and look like I have the mange.  The shaver will not cut two days&#x27; growth evenly, and no amount of rotating action, change in skin tightness, change in skin shape or contour will do anything to change that.  I brought this shaver camping for quick cleanup and am throwing it in the trash- $10 wasted.</li>
    <li> The product was fine, however when they shipped the product, they charged me postage on every piece I ordered.  Making the final price way over what I thought it should be.  They mailed all of the items in the same box, they should have charged  for the box not by the item.</li>
    <li> Got this for a gift for my father. He loves it!</li>
    <li> this shaver is horrid, the blades do not work as they should, feels like they pull hair instead of shave. would not cut through my beard at all, wirked ok on wifes legs but would pull hair alot</li>
    <li> My husband enjoys shaving with his new Emerson.  Does a great job! I recommend this product to all groups; men young and up in age!</li>
