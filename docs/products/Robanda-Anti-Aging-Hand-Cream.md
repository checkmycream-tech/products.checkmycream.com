<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great moisturizer and is helping reduce brown age spots</li>
    <li> This stuff has a strong odd odor, goes on feeling tacky, and smears a yellow tint to whatever you rest your hands against. Thought I&#x27;d like it because reviews looked good and because it had retinol in its formulation but I don&#x27;t even see evidence of retinol working, and I don&#x27;t even have horrible looking hands. Oh well. Probably finish the tube and definitely will be looking elsewhere for hand cream.</li>
    <li> Great for the hands. &amp;#34;My hands never looked better!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, who is in her seventies. She is addicted to it now. It has drastically reduced the brown spots on her hands, and it provides great moisture.</li>
    <li> Like this a lot keeps your hands very soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive products, but none of them offer the whole package: Sun protection, vitamins, in a creamy base at an affordable price. I love the way it absorbs right into the skin without leaving a slippery coating. Much recommended</li>
    <li> My hands are better but still have along way to go!  Old and wrinkled is hard to reverse.  I will give it more time.</li>
    <li> I use this nightly before I go to bed.  I like the way it smells, feels and absorbs.  I noticed after a few weeks, that the spots on my hands were less noticeable.  I had misplaced my cream for about a month and noticed my hands looking spotty again.  Ordered more recently.  Will order again.  I like it.  It works for me.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either :)</li>
    <li> This is not the item that I ordered. You did not send me the item in the picture. I e-mailed and told you that when I purchased the 1st ones and now that I ordered for the 2nd time, you still did not send me the correct item. This one is just like another hand cream. If I could have the item that I ordered, I would be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this creame for my hands. Afer a while I saw a huge difference. My hands look younger and more firm. Would buy again and recommend to anyone who wants a great creame for the hands without that fatty feeling.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the appearance of my hands after using this for two weeks.  Also, when you first apply the cream it makes your hands really shiny looking so that is a little weird but the shine only lasts for a couple of minutes.  For the price, I expected some results but don&#x27;t see any.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hand cream. The best I have found. Has sun screen. Doesn&#x27;t leave hands sticky.Leaves hands feeling so moist and soft.!</li>
    <li> Excellent product that really works to transform the skin of the hands over time!  Several of my friends have given me positive comments on the condition and improvement of my hands.  Many thanks!</li>
    <li> I  really like this product for my hands.</li>
    <li> I had doubts about this cream, but I decided to try it.  I bought it on March 12, 2015, so I&#x27;ve been using it for three months.  I noticed this morning that those hideous brown spots on my hands and forearms have almost gone.  I will continue to use this product every day and have just ordered another tube.  Great product!  You have to use it faithfully every day and wait for the cream to do its magic.</li>
    <li> Robanda Anti Aging Hand Cream is amazing!  It&#x27;s the first hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used that makes my hands look (and feel) better in just a few days.  Brown spots are fading fast and my old skin (70 years) already looks smoother and less wrinkled.  I&#x27;ll keep using this for as long as I&#x27;m able to buy it!  Do yourself a favor and try it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay! nothing to write home about</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years &amp; have found it to be the best hand cream.  It is never greasy yet soothing &amp; effective.</li>
    <li> This cream appears to work well as far as keeping new age spots from forming but I don&#x27;t see any reduction in the appearance of the age spots that I had prior to using it. It does absorb well and feels good on my skin.  Perhaps I Just haven&#x27;t used it long enough - about a month - will finish out the tube and see what happens...may not order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for two months.  The cream isn&#x27;t runny or greasy.  It smooths into my skin quickly.  I don&#x27;t see that any existing age spots have faded.  I haven&#x27;t gotten any further age spots since using Robanda.  It has toned down the sun damage on my forearms.  I am almost fifty-eight years old.  I wish I&#x27;d started using this product a decade ago.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and will re-order once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> Robanda Anti-Aging hand cream has made the age spots on my hands less noticable.  I live in a very dry climate and Robanda has done a good job of moisturizing.  It has a chemical type smell when first applied, but that goes away quickly.</li>
