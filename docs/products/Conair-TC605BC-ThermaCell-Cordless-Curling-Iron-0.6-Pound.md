      <li>Great price,  shipping was right on time and the seller was cool to deal with.  </li>
      <li>IN IT&#x27;S ORIGINAL PACKAGING!</li>
      <li>Very good back up.</li>
      <li>I may put to much hair in the iron, because it doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job.  </li>
      <li>For many years Braun, still a great product, was the only way to go.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use,</li>
      <li>easy to operate</li>
      <li>I used the curling iron on vacation and it maintained the required heat and it was easy to handle.</li>
      <li>It is so compact and easy to take with me.</li>
      <li>it worked great and almost better than my regular curling iron did.</li>
      <li>I purchased my Conair Cordless Curling Iron and it worked great the first time I used it, but the second time I tried to us it, it would begin to warm up and then go out.</li>

      <li>Great for short hair, which I have.</li>
      <li>Thanks for great and fast service, Tracey.</li>
      <li>It is also very economical on fuel.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
      <li>If extra time isn&#x27;t a factor, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to carry around a big corded curling iron that I didn&#x27;t even know if the plug would work, but I wanted to look good traveling and especially to look good in pictures.</li>
      <li>It is easy to operate, heats quickly and comes with a case that makes it easy to store and very portable.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to let the hair cool.  </li>
      <li>But the idea is not bad to have a no- cord product..</li>
      <li>The case made it easy to store and it got hot in no time.</li>
      <li>the first one still works fine, but needs a spark to heat up....with a 4 week trip</li>
      <li>It fits in your purse and you can do a quick style in no time.  </li>
      <li>The iron is smaller around than my regular one, but it still works great!</li>
      <li>I even use it when I&#x27;m staying in a house or hotel, because it heats up so quickly, and I&#x27;m not tethered to a power outlet.  </li>
      <li>It is so portable and heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>This curling iron doesn not get very hot.</li>
      <li>We live in an area that has many power outages.  </li>
      <li>Easy to put together and heats up fast.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used the curling iron on vacation and it maintained the required heat and it was easy to handle.</li>
    <li> WONDER for camping! Turned it on, curled my hair and I was on my way. The case made it easy to store and it got hot in no time.</li>
    <li> Love this powerful small curling iron. Lightweight. Easy to use. Great for camping or traveling. Nice size on the barrel.</li>
    <li> heats up real fast, works great. just wish the rod was thicker.  also wish amazon would have put the barrel size in easier to view before I purchased. still, for the  money.......good buy. I had 2 braun cordless in the past that I loved  better but they don&#x27;t make tham anymore.[[ASIN:B001BR6ALO Conair TC605BC ThermaCell Cordless Curling Iron, 0.6 Pound]]</li>
    <li> My curling iron came very fast and worked great! Took it with me on holidays to the BVI. Packed it with my checked bag just in case it might get taken away with my carry-on. No problems and I could quickly fix my hair while on the boat as we had no power except for a 12 volt which is no good for curling irons. Thanks for great and fast service, Tracey. Alberta Canada</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this product I read the reviews on Amazon.  Most said they traveled with it in their checked baggage with no trouble so I ordered it...figuring it is only $15 and if the TSA takes it, no major loss.  I emailed the TSA asking if I could bring it to China and they said yes.  I highlighted and attached their email response to the case and it was not taken...not sure if my bag was even opened.</li>
    <li> This was smaller than expected and seems rather cheap. I don&#x27;t expect it to last long.    On the positive side, it was delivered on time and is very portable.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this product, but I was planning on going to Japan. I actually use a curling iron to straighten my bangs, otherwise they curl (especially when it&#x27;s humid) and I look like a total dork. I didn&#x27;t want to carry around a big corded curling iron that I didn&#x27;t even know if the plug would work, but I wanted to look good traveling and especially to look good in pictures. This little device worked unexpectedly well, and saved me from looking and feeling dorky. My vacation was better because I had this. I totallly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is truly a great product.  It is so portable and heats up quickly.  The small barrel size works for my short hair, and it is  very lightweight and compact.  It is also very economical on fuel.  Wish I had gotten one sooner!!  No more bed head.</li>
    <li> I had a Conair hair curler before which lasted for years.  That is why I went for the same brand.  The newer one works just as well though it does not look as sturdy or well made as the old one.  If it also lasts a long time, I will be thrilled.</li>
    <li> The small compact Conair Cordless thermacell curling iron is very simple to operate and very well designed for the price. I appreciate the brush barrel protector when putting the iron away after use. It is easy to operate, heats quickly and comes with a case that makes it easy to store and very portable. Surprising performance for such a small price.</li>
    <li> i used the coniar curling iron as a touch up if needed for my wedding day hair. it worked great and almost better than my regular curling iron did. loved it!!</li>
    <li> I like how all pieces fit into the carrying case.  I keep it at my job so I can freshen up my \\&quot;do\\&quot; for any post-work functions.  It heats up very quickly and is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this little iron! I bought this for use on international trips and now I use it for everyday touch ups. I have taken this in my carry-on luggage on many domestic and international flights and have had no problems with security. It is compact, the iron heats up quickly (but little chance of scorching your ears/forehead/neck), makes nice, bouncy curls which last the whole day, and cools down quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you need to create an entire head of curls, but it works great for adding a little oomph to my fine, wavy hair. The only con of this product is that the butane refill cartridges are seemingly only available online.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron for those times that I don&#x27;t have access to my regular curling iron...camping etc. It works better than expected and gets nice and hot. It has a very small barrel which I&#x27;m learning to working with. I have very fine hair... I don&#x27;t know how it would be on thick hair. It&#x27;s very compact and portable. I like it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have 4 of these items. One in my drawer for daily use,one in each suitcase, and one spare, in case I need it. Wouldn&#x27;t be without my cordless curling iron.</li>
    <li> Have used a Butane curling iron for years (Braun Independent). Since it seems that it is no longer possible to get the Braun I was desperate to find an alternative.  While not nearly as good as the Braun (smaller curls; takes longer to get your style done) it it still well worth getting if you like the freedom of a butane type curling iron. Please note that while it is small enough to \\&quot;travel anywhere\\&quot; the cartridges will be confiscated by the TSA if you plan to take it in your carry on.</li>
    <li> This curling iron barely gets hot....wouldn&#x27;t put even a wave in hair.  Spend a couple more dollars and get the Conair TC700.  That&#x27;s a ceramic iron that heats up really fast and gets up to 360 degrees, but don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I have used cordless butane curling iron for over 20 years and this is the best I have ever had as well as being so compact for travel and easy to use.  I have ordered several for gifts for friends and extras to keep for back-up.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using these curling irons for many years (in fact she buys refill cartridges by the box).  She has never had a problem with any of them - other than wearing out from continued use.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THE CONAIR CORDLESS THERMA CURLING IRON MANY YEARS AGO  I WASN&#x27;T ABLE TO FIND ONE FOR A LONG TIME UNTIL I CHECKED AMAZON.  THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL, NO CORDS TO GET TANGLED, NO PLUG NECSESARY, AND IT IS A PRODUCT YOU CAN FIT INTO YOUR PURSE. MY HUSBAND AND I RIDE A HARLEY AND WHEN I GET OFF AND TAKE MY HELMET OFF MY HAIR IS FLAT..I SIMPLY TURN ON THE CURLING IRON, IT HEATS UP IMMEDIATLY AND I CAN GIVE MY HAIR A \\&quot;BOOST\\&quot; AND IT LOOKS GREAT.  I HAVE LOVED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS...I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT ON AMAZON.  THE PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN IT&#x27;S ORIGINAL PACKAGING! AT A GREAT PRICE!  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND I KNOW KNOW YOU WILL TO..I URGE YOU TO GET AND TRY THIS PRODUCT. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well this product worked. It is perfect for travel and last minute touch-up.</li>
    <li> I Like the iron very much, it is small but the barrel is large enough to make a good curl. And it comes with a case, good for travel.</li>
    <li> Cordless curl iron is the only way to go..convent plus ease. For many years Braun, still a great product, was the only way to go. Totally enjoyed there curl , yet, it seemed like suddenly you can not locate the irons and few places still carry the fluid. SADLY. Then wa-la discovering this delight plus a small carry case. The added bonus..........it actually gets hot, unlike so many of the corded models. THANK YOU. again and again.  The service was EXCELLENT.</li>
    <li> This is great for travel or camping.  It is portable, no cord, and just what I needed. It curls well too.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I expected too much of a cordless, but unlike most reviewers, I&#x27;m not happy with my purchase. While it may work for curling, I bought it so I could do a little hair  straightening while on the go. My hair tends to frizz and/or kink up after typically strenuous outdoor activities, or after a swim. It&#x27;s just not hot enough to solve the problem :(</li>
    <li> My  hair is short and it is the smallest one that I could find and it is cordless. Nice when I&#x27;m in  a hurry. Had to order from USA as we cannot find them in Canada. Braun had one the same size but I believe they discontinued it, so this is the only one available. Have used this model before and just love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron and so far I love it. It&#x27;s small size makes it great for traveling and it doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up.</li>
    <li> I have been using the cordless curling irons for over 20 years.  A friend gave me one for a birthday present back in the 80&#x27;s and I have been hooked on them ever since.  I cannot believe they are not being made anymore.  They are the best.  Before the new regulations on the airlines, I always took one w/me when we traveled, so that I could touch up before I landed.  I still keep them in both vehicles, just in case.  I think that if the manufacturers had advertised them they would still be around, but I still run into people that have never even seen one, didn&#x27;t know they existed.  And it is a shame.  I love mine.  And anytime I can find any online, I buy them.</li>
    <li> If you need a curling iron that is portable and can heat up in a mater of minutes, then this is for you.  It fits in your purse and you can do a quick style in no time.  I love this product.  Easy to use, easy to operate and you can buy refills.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I need a cordless hair curler for camping. This one fits the purpose . I had Conair before and wanted to stick with that brand.</li>
    <li> I love having this when I go camping...sometimes you don&#x27;t have showers at the campsite and this iron works perfectly on bed head!</li>
    <li> Not a bad curler, but I will say that if you use this one all the time the butane gets very expensive. The curls that come are not the greatest, but in a portable form it will work. Conair just really needs to figure out how to make them a little cheaper to use for the girl on the go!</li>
    <li> I received my iron, but where&#x27;s the hot air style brush attachment? It is in the picture. Not in the box:( that&#x27;s the whole reason I ordered it. Where can I get one of these?</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great use for me when we are camping.  The first time I used it, it worked great.  That is the only time I used it because, after that (1) one time, it would not work again, no matter what I did.  Sad to say, I would strongly recommend that you not waste your money on this product.  I had also paid for the brush attachment, that did not come with the curling iron. I contacted the company, they said they had told Amazon to not show the curling iron with the brush because they no longer carry the brush attachment.  They were very quick at refunding me back a portion of my payment for the brush attachment.  Any suggestions were I might find a good quality cordless curling iron???</li>
    <li> I have been using these curling irons for over 10 years. Lived in the Middle East for several years and their bathrooms do not have electrical outlets, so this was a great tool.  NO weird plugins to deal with worldwide. This is my third one as I rebuy them about every 5-10 years.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it every day and it has stood up well, even its case is still like new. It is so compact and easy to take with me. Fast heat up and cool down.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Conair Cordless Curling Iron and it worked great the first time I used it, but the second time I tried to us it, it would begin to warm up and then go out. I tried it at least ten times but it would not stay lit. When I got home I tried it again and the same thing happened. I was only able to us my [[ASIN:B001BR6ALO Conair TC605BC Cordless Curling Iron, 0.6-Pound]] curling iron one time and then it quit working.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I take this curling iron every year we do our camping trip.  It works excellent is long lasting and fast heating.</li>
    <li> Why did I ever believe this product could be carried onboard an airplane?  That is the question.  The answer is that it was claimed to be so in the description.  Even on the box it came in.  Thankfully I checked TSA online.  NO COMBUSTI BLE ITEMS ALLOWED! Also thankful no problem returning it.  Still wish there was a battery powered one.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be handy to keep at the office for touchups.  Unfortunately it&#x27;s too small to be effective.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times but all it did was make my hair kind of dry and straw-like.  It would be OK I guess if you have fine hair, or short hair.  Mine is thick and curly.</li>
    <li> It did not work the second time I used it.  I was in our motorhome so, it had been a while since I bought it.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Very good back up.</li>
    <li> Smaller than my usual hair tong but just as efficient. Love the little case it packs away into your handbag and ideal for travel use.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product as show on the website..I did not receive the exact product it was an off brand not CONAIR. They packaging was dirty and old looking. I tried calling the phone number on the packing list only to be routed to voicemail every time. Buyers beare.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of my money. The product worked one time and never worked again. It wasn&#x27;t even worth the shipping costs to return it. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I did not buy a similar model because it contained butane, but for this model, I didn&#x27;t see that it did. Well, it does. I bought it for a two-week trip to Europe and am now hesitant to take it because all flammable liquids are prohibited (checked or not). I&#x27;d hate for TSA to confiscate it and be out the cash I paid for it. Better to use it for domestic road trips.</li>
    <li> Very poor construction.  Reminds me of something you would use on a doll.</li>
    <li> I liked this curling iron until it stopped working after only 4 or 5 uses.  I should have returned it, but never got around to it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that performs just as it is descibed.  The Iron gets plenty Hot and is perfect for touch-ups, travel and all of the HUMID days! I Love it! The iron is smaller around than my regular one, but it still works great! The Thermacell is long lasting for me! I do have long hair but I only need a touch up when I use it, not a full use of all hair, so I get about 2 months or more from one cartridge.  Mostly the crown and top front layers getting curled, but it can do more.  Hope this helps you make a good choice!</li>
    <li> This is my second Conair Cordless curling iron in 15 years...the first one still works fine, but needs a spark to heat up....with a 4 week trip I couldn&#x27;t take the chance of the spark, running out of spark. No plugs, short heat up time...wonderful, wonderful. I put a cotton glove on my left hand...it makes it easier and don&#x27;t have to worry about a burnt finger.

    <li> Great for short hair, which I have. Living  in humid Florida and having curly hair prone to frizz, I find this works well for my bangs and any stray strands.  Takes a minute to heat up hot enough to use. .Be patient and pull the hair through the roller slowly. I have used it to comb through my hair  and  also a little back brushing.  Small enough to fit in purse.  Don&#x27;t forget to let the hair cool.  I don&#x27;t see how this would work on long hair though as brush  is very small but lworks for me.  Glad I bought it along with extra butane cartridges.  I would recommend for short hair only, hence the 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE JUST LOVES THIS PRODUCT AND WHAT IT DOES FOR HER HAIR, WHO WOULD THINK THAT THIS COMPACT DEVICE IS OF SUCH GREAT QUALITY......BUY IT AND YOU WONT REGRET IT AT ALL, AND THE CARTRIDGES THAT FUEL THE ITEMS HEAT LAST A LONG TIME, JUST A VERY AMAZING PRODUCT......THAT IS WHY THEY SAY BIG THINGS COME IN LITTLE PACKAGES</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who has used these for many many years. They used to be sold locally at WalMart but have been discontinued for some reason.  She claims great product and they work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is the best travel curler that I have ever had and I&#x27;ve had quite a few.  Great price,  shipping was right on time and the seller was cool to deal with.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> It is so portable and heats up so fast! Works just as good as any other curling iron, probably because it can get so hot.  The cartridges seem like they will last a long time too because Ive used the curling iron a bunch and the cartridge still looks practically full.    Fyi, I couldnt find the size of the barrel when I was looking to purchase this item, and it is a small barrel -- like a 1/2 inch.  I wish they had a larger barrel one, like a 1 1/2 inch, but beggars cant be choosers and this curling iron is truly awesome</li>
    <li> We live in an area that has many power outages.  I got the curling for those times.  I have thick hair, but fine.  The curling iron doesn&#x27;t get that hot (although I am used to having a 400 degree flat iron).  I may put to much hair in the iron, because it doesn&#x27;t do that good of a job.  It will work in a pinch, so I like that.  Easy to put together and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> This curling iron doesn not get very hot. I would not recommend it. It would do in a pinch for traveling.</li>
    <li> Handy little curling iron.  Works well.</li>
    <li> When I intially tried using this it would not heat up.  I had to keep fiddling with it to get it to work.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  I had a curling before that used cells and it was great, but this one is not even close to that one.</li>
    <li> great product. Thanks</li>
    <li> I used this same product years ago when I was stationed overseas, and am now using it for my camping trips.  If I don&#x27;t curl my bangs, they lie flat on my forehead and look yucky.  So I keep this in my travel kit, and use it for a quick little curl of the bangs even when I&#x27;m in the middle of nowhere.  I even use it when I&#x27;m staying in a house or hotel, because it heats up so quickly, and I&#x27;m not tethered to a power outlet.  When there&#x27;s competition for the bathroom, I don&#x27;t have to stand in line, or hog valuable bathroom time,  just to curl my bangs.  I bought two spare power cells, but after almost two years I&#x27;m still on the first one.  This has been a great addition to my toiletry case.</li>
    <li> The product is okay, but not much usable.. I am disapointed. But the idea is not bad to have a no- cord product..</li>
    <li> This is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for for years! Unforunately, for me - living in Switzerland . it&#x27;s going to last me approximately 5 months, because you won&#x27;t (can&#x27;t) send me the refill chargers...I just don&#x27;t know what to do - and I feel very unhappy about it because the curler really is The Best. Can&#x27;t you send them by sea?</li>
    <li> The Conair Cordless Curling iron is small and compact. It is great for travel as you don&#x27;t have to be looking for a plugin close to a mirror. I find it particularly good as the small barrel works with my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I was not very happy with the product - doesn&#x27;t get very hot and is not very sturdy. I am not sending it back but probably not the type of product I would buy on line again.. Also the shipping charges are exorbitant! That is my fault.....for making the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for women on the go. I like the fact that it is so small and portable.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my Mother in Law wanted for traveling!!! It is smaller than we had thought it would be, but it definitely does the job. Overall great product!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s quick and easy. I use it all the time</li>
    <li> Although I have an electric travel curling iron, there are still places where trying to use an American product is a problem even with an adapter/converter.  Hence, I wanted a curling iron that was easily transported when I travel, and this Conair was the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> Whoever came up with this little iron was a genius.  I take it with me when motorcycling.  It does&#x27;t take up space but I have a way to fluff out my hair after wearing a helmet.  GOOD JOB!</li>
    <li> Conair, is one of the best curling irons out there. I have been using them for years! This is my 3rd cordless conair iron. You can use this anywhere! The shipment was fast. The iron woks like a dream. It heats up soo fast! I love it. I will order from this seller again! Thanks</li>
    <li> What a handy curling iron.  I always take it when traveling.  I have used one for years but my last one broke and Amazon saved my life!!!</li>
    <li> Went with different brand. From experience this brand seems to have good value and will probably have better results with replacements fuel cells.</li>
    <li> The photo of the product clearly shows a comb attachment over the curling iron.  I have used the product WITH comb and loved it.  I lost it on a trip this past summer and I have missed it.  I went on-line, saw the \\&quot;same\\&quot; product, and purchased it.  When it arrived, there was no comb attachment.  Upon investigation, the product I received is considered the \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version.  Attachments of any kind are great, as the user can choose to use them or not; thereby, satisfying a greater number of people.  My hair is very fine and the comb was immensely helpful.  I NEVER burned myself either, as the comb keeps the hot iron away from your hands and scalp.  PLEASE put the comb attachment back!  If you do . . . I&#x27;ll buy it -- again!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The positive is that curling iron really works and heats up within a reasonable length of time. It is light weight. But, it takes 2 time longer for a curl to set than even the cheapest electric iron. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t get that hot. I bought it for travel and it comes with a handy travel case but one would have to take it apart to put it into the case. A bit inconvenient. If extra time isn&#x27;t a factor, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
