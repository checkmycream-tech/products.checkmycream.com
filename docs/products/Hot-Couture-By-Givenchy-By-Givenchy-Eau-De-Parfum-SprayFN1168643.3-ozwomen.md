<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was not happy! I have worn it in the passed and loved it. It smelled like it is really old!</li>
    <li> First found this fragrance in a department store in Paris. I fell in love with it the moment I smelled it. Warm, peppery-scent, it&#x27;s worth the money, because you really only need a spray or two all day. The Body wash is amazing also, but Givenchy makes it hard to find this scent around...so when I find a good deal I buy in bulk as much as I can. Amazing, hot, sexy smelling perfume. Love it.</li>
    <li> Shipped relatively fast - and well packaged. Only minor problem with this perfum is that it does not EXACTLY smell like the predecessor. Not sure if this is because its a slightly modified scenet or because of another reason. It still smells great but a tad more tart than the original (the very first Hot Couture).</li>
    <li> This is one of my faves!  It seems more like a night time scent...for me anyway.  When you wear this you are almost guaranteed to get complimented!!!</li>
    <li> Although I love the way this product smells on my wife, it is no longer available in stores; therefore, I have to find it on-line.  However, when my wife opened the box as part of her birthday gifts, there was almost an ounce out of the bottle.  It appeared to be packaged like that and not leaked because there was no discoloration of the box it was packaged in.  Although I would recommend the fragrance, I would recommend buying it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and i had been looking for it over the whole country (South Africa). Thrilled that i can buy it from Amazon.    One of the most elegant perfumes i know, very elegant, classy yet subtle aroma....</li>
    <li> My girlfriend had told me some months back about this perfume. I remembered she said Couture, but I couldn&#x27;t recall if she said Hot or Juicy. I&#x27;m glad I went with my gut and got her this. I&#x27;ve already associated the sweet sophisticated smell with her.    She was blown away when she opened the box as the perfume is no longer available in the US. She has told me she always receives compliments whenever she has worn it and she can identify it from a mile away if another woman is wearing it as well - which is rare :)     I highly recommend this perfume, its a great mix of sexy and sophistication good for young and the young at heart.</li>
    <li> I love this Parfum, had it before long ago then I coulnd find it anymore, so I had the idea of looking for it on amazon. I got it for Christmas!!!... Sooooo HAPPY!!&lt;br /&gt;Merry Christmas Everyone!!</li>
    <li> HOT COUTURE BY GIVENCHY HAS BEEN MY SIGNATURE FRAGRANCE SINCE IT FRIST CAME OUT.  THIS WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE IS PERFECT FOR ANY OCCASION.  PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME \\&quot;WHAT ARE YOU WEARING\\&quot;.  I TELL THEM, BUT ADD IT&#x27;S HARD TO FIND.  I HAVE TO BUY IT ON LINE.  TRY AMAZON.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me for Mother&#x27;s Day. I have been wearing this perfume for years and I am extremely familiar with it&#x27;s smell, as I wear it everyday. When this bottle showed up, the color was off. So I sprayed my wrist to do a sniff test. WORST IDEA EVER. Not only did it NOT smell like my favorite perfume, it smelled like a weird turpentine and alcohol mixture. Plus, once sprayed, made my wrist feel like it was on fire. I washed it twice with soap and still the burning skin would not abate. So instead of my favorite perfume for Mother&#x27;s Day, I got HIVES. Thanks, hubby! This product is clearly either very old or a knock-off.</li>
    <li> One of the best fragrances I have ever owned. I hate this was discontinued. It is a light scent that lingers as you leave the rooms.</li>
    <li> This perfume has an all day sweet and fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering (so long as you stick to one or two sprays). Every time I wear it I get a compliment, and that&#x27;s always nice. :) Perfect for any occasion.  Although, since people are selective with their own perfumes I would go to a department store and smell- then buy for the great price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This was my signature fragrance for years, and then it seemed like it disappeared from the marketplace.  I saw it return a number of years ago, but the price was close to $100, which put it out of my price range.  Then I recently saw it on Amazon, and I got excited.  The price right now is very good, so I ordered it.  The seller was Amazon.com LLC.  I received it today and sprayed it on my arm.  It&#x27;s the same EDP I wore years ago.  I&#x27;d recognize the fragrance anywhere.  I ALWAYS received compliments from someone whenever I wore it.  I still love it and am very glad to see it is available again.  After reading other reviews with low ratings, I have to say I am thankful I purchased it from Amazon because it&#x27;s fresh and clean and it still loves my chemistry.  Woohoo!  I am very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Arrived in very good condition, and it was exactly the product advertised.</li>
    <li> This is one of my most favorite Parfum and will be very happy to use it. A great prodcut for my needs.</li>
    <li> My favorite, I get a compliments all the time.  Please never stop selling this!</li>
    <li> I have paid as much as $63.21 for it.I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve worn for years and I use to only find it in upper scale department stores for a hefty price. I&#x27;m glad Amazon.com is selling it now.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping; Sealed, Authentic Fragrance, and a steal of a deal!!! I receive countless compliments when I wear this fragrance&lt;br /&gt;I am BEYOND satisfied and will most definitely purchase again!!!! :)</li>
    <li> hot stuff for my wife , makes her feal like a natural woman , she enters the room and heads turn her way with just a hint of spray</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t smell the same as my last bottle of Hot Couture. Not sure if it&#x27;s old or what, but I&#x27;ll probably not order online again.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this perfume it went bad after about 6 months.... The smell totally changed and it had to be thrown away. Big waste of money. I had bought 2 bottles, one for myself and one for my girlfriends birthday.</li>
    <li> Another oldie but goodie was skeptical about ordering with some of the reviews took a chance anyway and ordered brand new in the box sprayed some on my arm and thus far it smells exactly like my last bottle the color look the same not to sure on what other folks was saying about the turpentine smell but however if you are a fan of this perfume this  is a good price for it.. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Since I found Hot Couture, I love the light musk smell. I wear it every day and love that the scent does not leave me.</li>
    <li> I love Hot Couture and have been wearing it for several years.  People always comment and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my sister. She really loved it. It smells sophisticated and it definitely suits a woman in her 20s or 30s. It has a very unique smell that&#x27;s pleasant on the nose; it&#x27;s not too overpowering and holds up very nicely throughout the day. You don&#x27;t really see this perfume in stores so it&#x27;s really awesome that Amazon has it (I saw it in Canada but not in major retailers in the USA like Macy&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> perfect product given as expected , 100% recommended, given in a good time, 100% to buy again, good product, happy</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with this perfume when I sprayed it for the first time. It smells great, I love it, I made the right choice. It is sweet and soo hooot, a really hot couture, I love it!</li>
    <li> Just say: I love this perfume, aroma and identifies me, I use it for several years and does not bore me</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife and she loves it, as do I!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this for years...FINALLY... this IS the original scent...Get compliments...numerous per day.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I have bought Hot Couture at a department store  a couple times and loved it. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately, so tried on line. I was excited to find it, however when I received it, it smelled kind of funky- maybe old or something.   Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> This is a crowd favorite that never disappoints. Men love it, women ask for it by name. It arrived on time, wrapped perfectly for the event. Neither heavy nor overbearing, it lingers just long enough to cause a stir like any fashionable icon. Tuck it away during social events or the powder room will continuously bear the scent of a guest&#x27;s irresistible curiosity.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for years.  It is not overwhelming by any means.  I have been stopped numerous time asking me what scent I was wearing.  I love it.</li>
    <li> All perfect. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Magnificent aroma, great price.  This perfume is now hard to get, and so it is great that you can find it on the webb.  Don&#x27;t know why it didn&#x27;t sell better, everyone loves how it compliments a beautiful women.</li>
    <li> Everytime I wear this fragrance, I receive compliments.  Its a fragrance for year round.  I wish they also made powder, soap and candles.</li>
    <li> Hi love this Perfume &amp; grateful to have found it on Amazon! Thank you for offering it to the Public! ...Sara</li>
    <li> I have been without this perfume for several years and finally decided to gift myself this Christmas. Smells as wonderful as I remember.</li>
    <li> I smelled this on someone one day &amp; loved it.  Now, when I wear it, other people compliment me.  It smells so good!!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe they discontinued this product. I have received so many compliments on it. I must have over 50 bottles of top of the line expensive perfumes on my dresser and I rate this Top 3! My sister is like me. She has tons and tons and tons of perfumes and this is her \\&quot;go to\\&quot; number one! She loves it! My mom is not a perfume person and even she loves it. I wore it on my first date with my husband! This is one of those perfumes that you can buy without smelling first and you will just love it! I promise! ( I don&#x27;t recommend the lotion or cream..they smell a little different)</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for almost 10 years.  I always get so many compliments on the scent.  I used to order it on http://www.fragrancenet.com/ but it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best scent. You cannot go wrong with this one. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I am still not tired of it.</li>
    <li> Very good scent,&lt;br /&gt; I get a lot of compliments wearing this!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! If you like fragrances with an oriental touch, you&#x27;ll love this. Smells a little wood, but also has something sweet. It makes you feel radiant, special. I really recommend it, it is a very rich fragrance. This is one of the few fragrances that have fallen in love from the first time I met her. It is very good for the night. I recommend it! The seller was very satisfied, met all my expectations!</li>
    <li> Not even the right scent. Smelled like turpentine mixed with alcohol. Actually burned my wife&#x27;s skin when she sprayed it on her wrist. My guess is the product was old and had been sitting in a warehouse somewhere for far too long.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this very perfume for over 10 years now. I always get compliments on it. It has a warm clean smell. My mom is very sensitive too perfumes and most people cannot wear perfume around her. This is one she does not have a reaction too.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments on the smell of the fragrance. I&#x27;ve could smell it but don&#x27;t like overpowering perfumes. People have commented how pleasant this is.</li>
    <li> This is it! I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for over ten years and the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it in parfum form since it was re-released was Heathrow airport in London. Everywhere else only had the toilette. I can&#x27;t thank Amazon enough for stocking this fragrance as a parfum. I&#x27;ll be a loyal customer, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance itself, it&#x27;s different from the toilette. It&#x27;s slightly stronger, yes, but the scent itself is different. I always thought it had a cotton candy element to it. I hear raspberry and pink peppercorn mentioned a lot and I can see that. The scent is classy--think soft, crinkly black velvet and pearls. Think of stolen kisses and moonlight dancing at midnight with your secret lover.</li>
    <li> This perfume is hard to find in stores.  It is lovely and  I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery!  Great price!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume and so by extension, I do too! It smells great on her and it&#x27;s her favorite.</li>
    <li> Smells like...well like my main squeeze always has - awesome. You can hardly get this in the States now for some reason. I believe this shipped in from the Virgin Islands or something. The price was reasonable and her supply has now been replenished. The aroma is hard to describe other than to say it is distinctively feminine and, well, HOT!</li>

    <li> Super deal for a fantastic fragrance!</li>
    <li> I first bought this for my wife years ago and now she doesn&#x27;t like to wear anything else.  Well, she likes to wear clothes sometimes, but she doesn&#x27;t like to wear any other perfume.</li>
    <li> I paid $10.00 more a year ago in a mall for Hot Couture than my total price I paid to you and the bottle was 1/3 the size of the bottle I received from you.  Needless to say I am thrilled with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a knock off. I just received it. I have been wearing this scent for years and usually purchase it from the department store. The true Hot Couture has a sweet finish and this has a weird old lady  musk to it. It also lacks the traditional color and packaging. It&#x27;s a decent knock off but it&#x27;s not right and shouldn&#x27;t be advertised as genuine.</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a gift when my girlfriend was running low. Strangely enough, something is off. She smells it doesn&#x27;t quite smell like the other one does. I am not sure if it is old or what. I was troubled by some of the reviews on here, but I have to side with them. The coloring is off (compared to her other bottle) and so is the fragrance. Not that it smells bad, though. So buyer beware - just be ready to return if you think it might not be totally authentic.</li>
    <li> Pleased with my purchase of this item-of the size and the price I paid for it!!!</li>
    <li> The package and bottle were in excellent condition and it arrived on time.  This scent is timeless and I always go back to this scent.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very hard to find this product now.  It is a wonderful fragrance that I get many compliments on every time I use it.</li>
    <li> My wife love this stuff and it is the good stuff</li>
