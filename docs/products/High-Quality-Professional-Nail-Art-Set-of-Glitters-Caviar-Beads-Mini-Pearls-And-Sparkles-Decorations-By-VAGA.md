      <li>Great price , such variety....tiny bottles</li>
      <li>Too fun!</li>
      <li>Great value love the small jars for travel.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re ordering this set DO NOT USE clear top coat.</li>
      <li>the product was easy to use and the quality was very professional</li>
      <li>They are just over an inch tall and do not have much product inside (none are full).  </li>
      <li>super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I do like the idea of all the different items, just wish I received more.</li>
      <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
      <li>These are great one bottle came broken</li>
      <li>I got a bunch of the same kind of stuff in each bottle like I have 5 bottles of red diamond shapes and just a bunch of identical bottles though out.</li>
      <li>I suggest that you have a placemat/paper towel underneath to help clean up and put back in bottle.</li>
      <li>If you lay them down and lay a penny on top it will literally cover the whole of 2 vials.</li>
      <li>The little glass bottles are tiny but they hold a good deal of glitters etc...  </li>
      <li>You may get 2-3 nails worth if you have smaller fingers.  </li>
      <li>Some of the other designs, while cute, I won&#x27;t use simply because they&#x27;re not my style.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The vials are full enough, but they are way smaller than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>more than half the gems are super small</li>
      <li>3 of the bottles are half full.  </li>
      <li>These little tiny teeny jars are so fun.</li>
      <li>so much for so little.</li>

<li> The bottles are MUCH smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> but they go a long way...</li>
<li> these bottles are so small that you cannot even complete both hands with one color!</li>
<li> For the price, I won&#x27;t feel too bad losing more than I&#x27;ll actually need on my nails.</li>
<li> However, that being said, I&#x27;m pleased that they were intact upon arrival considering how delicate and thin the glass is.</li>
<li> Not worth sending it back.</li>
<li> Teeny tiny bottles I thought they would be bigger :/</li>
<li> The bottles are very tiny, maybe an inch and a half?</li>
<li> then we thought in the bottles were hard to open to open some of them we had a break</li>
<li> And some came half empty.</li>
<li> /&gt;The jars are small, I&#x27;m talking about an inch and change tall small, but the pearls go a long way if your&#x27;re only doing one caviar nail per hand.</li>
<li> not  worth the buy..</li>
<li> I wish there was a disclaimer stating some items subject to change</li>
<li> so I feel like I&#x27;ll be wasting half of the bottle by just dumping it out.  </li>
<li> Like I said previous but here is a pic with all the bottles with their likes</li>
<li> Neatly package and in little glass bottles.</li>
<li> And they had little variety.</li>
<li> A few of them look like colored sugar you would use on sugar cookies at Christmas.  </li>
<li> Bottles are vedy small and not a lot of stuff in them</li>
<li> and you&#x27;ll know what I mean.</li>
<li> They are very small bottles.</li>
<li> Some of the bottles we&#x27;re broken.</li>
<li> item came in broken.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not exactly a great self-manicurist</li>
<li> One was broken when I received this set.</li>
<li> The containers are too small!!!</li>
<li> worthless......</li>

    <li> I got a bunch of the same kind of stuff in each bottle like I have 5 bottles of red diamond shapes and just a bunch of identical bottles though out.</li>
    <li> Loved them you won me over!!</li>
    <li> Like I said previous but here is a pic with all the bottles with their likes</li>
    <li> The tiny pearls I have used multiple times for the caviar look. If that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re ordering this set DO NOT USE clear top coat. I have several and each one removed the color of the pearls making them the unfinished matte silver underneath the finished coating. Some of the other designs, while cute, I won&#x27;t use simply because they&#x27;re not my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jars are small, I&#x27;m talking about an inch and change tall small, but the pearls go a long way if your&#x27;re only doing one caviar nail per hand.</li>
    <li> They are very small bottles. And they had little variety. And some came half empty.</li>
    <li> These little tiny teeny jars are so fun. Plenty of beads that are also teeny weeny. Too fun!</li>
    <li> item came in broken.  just one bottle so that a plus</li>
    <li> Perfect and totally worth ever penny !</li>
    <li> They look nice on my nail</li>
    <li> The bottles are very tiny, maybe an inch and a half?</li>
    <li> Teeny tiny bottles I thought they would be bigger :/</li>
    <li> Great for nails and crafting........so much for so little. The little glass bottles are tiny but they hold a good deal of glitters etc...  Spill one and you&#x27;ll know what I mean. Beautiful colors!!!</li>
    <li> Very tiny, but very cute!!!!</li>
    <li> Great value love the small jars for travel.</li>
    <li> Great price , such variety....tiny bottles but they go a long way...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the optical illusion that these are big bottles! They are just over an inch tall and do not have much product inside (none are full).  You may get 2-3 nails worth if you have smaller fingers.  I do like the idea of all the different items, just wish I received more.</li>
    <li> Okay i did  not know it would be so many. Neatly package and in little glass bottles. Have not used them yet but will be buying more!</li>
    <li> The bottles are MUCH smaller than I expected. However, that being said, I&#x27;m pleased that they were intact upon arrival considering how delicate and thin the glass is. Very cute! Will order from this Seller again.</li>
    <li> One was broken when I received this set. Not worth sending it back.</li>
    <li> very easy to work with. just love it , will help my business.  Thank-you KLS</li>
    <li> Some of the bottles we&#x27;re broken.</li>
    <li> These are cute but I actually bought mine from a local Dollar Tree which also has foil flakes and rhinestones.</li>
    <li> Very happy with quality of product, but it is much smaller in person.</li>
    <li> This came just as pictured. No two colors are the same.</li>
    <li> The containers are too small!!!</li>
    <li> These are great one bottle came broken but I love them</li>
    <li> Love the color variety!</li>
    <li> these bottles are so small that you cannot even complete both hands with one color! worthless......</li>
    <li> Bottles are vedy small and not a lot of stuff in them</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than I thought they were going to be. Still cute</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Well priced.</li>
    <li> Love, Amazing, recommend to all buyers. super fast shipping. Product exactly as described. Great price. extremely happy.</li>
    <li> The vials are full enough, but they are way smaller than I was expecting. If you lay them down and lay a penny on top it will literally cover the whole of 2 vials.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my order the product was easy to use and the quality was very professional I was very satisfied on my purchase and plan to purchase more.</li>
    <li> did not receive what is shown in Picture. I wish there was a disclaimer stating some items subject to change</li>
    <li> They were a lot smaller then we thought in the bottles were hard to open to open some of them we had a break</li>
    <li> These are very tiny vials of different decorations.  A few of them look like colored sugar you would use on sugar cookies at Christmas.  The others are larger items (hearts, stars, etc.) that are really adorable.  My only problem is figuring out how to get them onto my nails.  I&#x27;m not exactly a great self-manicurist so I feel like I&#x27;ll be wasting half of the bottle by just dumping it out.  For the price, I won&#x27;t feel too bad losing more than I&#x27;ll actually need on my nails.</li>
    <li> Some of these are beads that could be strung on thread. 3 of the bottles are half full.  A lot of variety and could be used for various crafts also, ie cards.  When using/opening a bottle I suggest that you have a placemat/paper towel underneath to help clean up and put back in bottle.</li>
    <li> more than half the gems are super small&lt;br /&gt;almost MICROSCOPIC! not  worth the buy..</li>
