      <li>Lol) and decided to mix them up with aloe vera gel to use as a massage gel.</li>
      <li>The seller is great though.</li>
      <li>But please do your own research on these ingredients!</li>
      <li>On the bright side, the herbs often lessen or eliminate menopausal symptoms making the transition easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but you do have to stay on top of taking them!</li>
      <li>Chat sites and forums on herbal breast enhancement are rife with people selling their own products.</li>
      <li>more so that was nice</li>
      <li>Your body needs a well balanced diet to promote healthy breast tissue.</li>
      <li>Carbonated beverages have no effect on the program, though there are better things for your diet.</li>
      <li>It has definitely been working for me, but again, that&#x27;s because I know the herbs contained in this product work great with my body!</li>
      <li>Prevention Magazine, who coined the phrase, put it this way: &amp;#34;These are the &amp;#34;kitchen sink&amp;#34; supplements, products that have as many as 20 herbs in a tablet or capsule.</li>
      <li>Searching the globe for a magic bullet herb.</li>
      <li>I will give this product more time and let you guys know the ending results.</li>
      <li>See more at: http://www.greenbush.net/10thyounetok.html#sthash.MG06u5hs.dpuf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Diligence is more important than timing.</li>
      <li>The combination of herbs gives this a strong odor</li>
      <li>If you read the fine print no one qualifies for them.</li>
      <li>Caffeine is fine in moderation, though it can contribute to breast tenderness, so limit it if this is a problem for you.</li>
      <li>Shipped in quick!</li>
      <li>and I filled out my bra</li>
      <li>And they may be right, that it seems more scientific.</li>
      <li>Many of the breast enhancement formula companies apparently feel that the more ingredients they put in their capsule, the more scientific it will seem to people.</li>
      <li>Many of the more highly hyped companies have been fined by the FTC for not fulfilling the guarantees.</li>
      <li>This product happens to have the main herbs that work for me the best and is quite cheap compared to the other products around on the web.</li>
      <li>They are full but saggy.</li>
      <li>capsule itself is quite large but still easy to swallow so</li>
      <li>You really aren’t doing yourself a favor by getting cheap herbs at a discount store.</li>
      <li>We have never been clear on why so many of those formula companies make these statements.</li>
      <li>They are actually rating their own products at the #1 position.</li>
      <li>This product is easily worth the money in my eyes.</li>
      <li>Women with high metabolism and low body fat, or with very strenuous exercise programs often need higher doses of the herbs and seem to take longer to see good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Obsessing about exact milligrams or milliliters is not productive.</li>
      <li>The only ingredients that you need are the herbs, in a potent form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just make sure that you are getting enough of the herbs into your system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What does matter is taking the herbs consistently every day, and using massage in your program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But more ingredients only weakens the dose of the nutrients that you need.</li>
      <li>It just ruins the rating on a product that is actually quite good for the price!</li>
      <li>Very clever.</li>
      <li>And after taking so many supplements daily, I kind of felt like being lazy and searched around for an &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; supplement.</li>
      <li>Women in this age group have slowing hormone production and often need higher doses of the herbs than normal.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Fruits, vegetables and whole grains are very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>My smaller one is slowly catching up to the larger.</li>
      <li>I took a break for one month before trying it and detoxed my body to make sure I was &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; from all the other herbs I took.</li>
      <li>I did notice the hot flashes cooling off and my mood is a little better.</li>
      <li>None of these things make any particular difference in effectiveness.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to take this product at the same time everyday</li>
      <li>You may be able to match or exceed the larger breasted women in your family, but generally no one is going to become a DD in a family of B’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My breasts kept their volume and became a little more lifted, I do not know if it increases breast size though.</li>
      <li>See “The Green Pharmacy” by Dr. James Duke for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is no need to go searching for some exotic new herb about which there is little or no research or track record of safety.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After I use this product for the full three month supply, I will update with pictures (bare chested but nipples covered) and measurement growth overall.</li>
      <li>We often hear from women fretting about the exact time, daily or monthly, that the herbs should be taken, whether they need “on and off” schedules, whether the herbs should be taken with food or without.</li>
      <li>So far, I am gaining weight everywhere including my stomach.</li>
      <li>know what herbs work for me with my natural breast enlargement</li>
      <li>No one can tell you exactly how this will work for you or how long it will take.</li>
      <li>Diosgenin and assorted other phytoestrogens in fenugreek, fennel and wild yam, and the sapponins in saw palmetto are all that you really need.</li>
      <li>And the herbs are actually quite good for you, not some dangerous experiment on your body.</li>
      <li>im still on my first bottle after 4 months from not taking them everyday.</li>

<li> im still on my first bottle after 4 months from not taking them everyday.</li>
<li> Exact dosing is not necessary and it is difficult to take too much of the herbs.</li>
<li> We never give up since we have seen women have difficulties for long periods and then suddenly start to see improvements.</li>
<li> The other twenty percent will generally see results with a diligent effort.</li>
<li> Slow but surely, I can see and feel a little difference in my breasts, I&#x27;m a transgender male who lives and dresses fulltime as a woman out in public everyday, and other people notice the difference in my appearance also</li>
<li> I actually had a few extra capsules</li>
<li> Not that anything bad is included in this, just make sure</li>
<li> There are fillers and additives, the herbs are often irradiated to kill bacteria, and potency varies widely.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard enough to get an active dose of one herb into a single tablet or capsule, much less 20 active doses of 20 different herbs.</li>
<li> /&gt;It contains 8 ingredients that have been used for breast enlargement in other products like the ever-so-popular Breast Actives and are known to work for some women.</li>
<li> You can get some idea of your size limit by looking at other women in your gene pool.</li>
<li> Some days it seems like it&#x27;s working, &amp; other days it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Women of all ages can see improvements, but we have noticed that the period just before menopause, mid to late forties, can hamper things a bit.</li>
<li> And chocolate, especially dark chocolate, contains flavenoids that can actually be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Another 30 percent have to work a little harder or wait a little longer, increasing doses, etc.</li>
<li> Been using for three and a half weeks</li>
<li> I have been using this product for about two and a half months.</li>
<li> With NBE, what you try may not work for you, but it will work for someone else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, with this product I have been taking it for one month and already feel it working and have grown about half an inch.</li>
<li> In our eight years of experience with the herbs we have found that about half the women who use the program see results within two to six weeks.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve seen almost half an inch growth.</li>
<li> My breast are a little fuller but the firmness is not there.</li>
<li> Waste of money did nothing.</li>
<li> There are a few things that will give you a clue however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Even though that is unfortunately happening, my breast are getting slightly bigger.</li>
<li> Not sure if they work..</li>
<li> Its really hard trying to take 2 pills 3 times a day.</li>
<li> These herbs are common foods and spices not drugs.</li>
<li> For instance, fenugreek can lower your cholesterol which may not be bad unless you already have low cholesterol...</li>
<li> Poor diet and smoking can slow results.</li>
<li> My bust get bigger but also my waist and everything else... :(</li>
<li> Notice fullness, sensitivity to breast, and a bit of a lift...increase in breast size - not sure?!?!  </li>
<li> That is disappointing.</li>
<li> Bad taste and bad aftertaste...</li>
<li> &amp; they smell and taste awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It arrived on time. I&#x27;ve been taken 2 bottles and have not seen any changes.</li>
    <li> Notice fullness, sensitivity to breast, and a bit of a lift...increase in breast size - not sure?!?!  I guess I&#x27;ll give it some time</li>
    <li> Its really hard trying to take 2 pills 3 times a day. I just don&#x27;t have enough time to keep track! &amp; they smell and taste awful. Not sure if they work.. im still on my first bottle after 4 months from not taking them everyday. I regret spending my money!</li>
    <li> This product definitely worked for me, but in order to keep the results or continue to see results you must keep buying them, or the effects will wear off once you run out.</li>
    <li> 10 Things You Should Know About Herbal Breast Enhancment&lt;br /&gt; 1. The “Breast Enhancement Reviews”, “Product Comparison” and “Breast Pill Ratings” sites are run by the companies that sell the products. They are actually rating their own products at the #1 position. Very clever. Don’t be fooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Chat sites and forums on herbal breast enhancement are rife with people selling their own products. These are just sales pitches often from affiliate sellers. There is also a lot of misleading information on the forums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. 100% Money Back Guarantees” are bogus. If you read the fine print no one qualifies for them. This has been going on for years. Many of the more highly hyped companies have been fined by the FTC for not fulfilling the guarantees. They just go out of business and come back as another brand. Remember “Isis”, “Bloussant”, “Curves for Women”? Think about it for a minute. Why would a company guarantee results when they have no control over how you use the product and no way of verifying whether you had results or not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. “Kitchen Sink” formulas. Many of the breast enhancement formula companies apparently feel that the more ingredients they put in their capsule, the more scientific it will seem to people. And they may be right, that it seems more scientific. But more ingredients only weakens the dose of the nutrients that you need. Prevention Magazine, who coined the phrase, put it this way: &amp;#34;These are the &amp;#34;kitchen sink&amp;#34; supplements, products that have as many as 20 herbs in a tablet or capsule. It&#x27;s hard enough to get an active dose of one herb into a single tablet or capsule, much less 20 active doses of 20 different herbs. Bottom line: They just don&#x27;t work.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. These herbs are common foods and spices not drugs. Exact dosing is not necessary and it is difficult to take too much of the herbs. Obsessing about exact milligrams or milliliters is not productive. And the herbs are actually quite good for you, not some dangerous experiment on your body. Just make sure that you are getting enough of the herbs into your system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Searching the globe for a magic bullet herb. Diosgenin and assorted other phytoestrogens in fenugreek, fennel and wild yam, and the sapponins in saw palmetto are all that you really need. There are thousands of herbs that contain these things, but in smaller concentrations. We simply use those that contain the highest concentrations. There is no need to go searching for some exotic new herb about which there is little or no research or track record of safety. See “The Green Pharmacy” by Dr. James Duke for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Diligence is more important than timing. We often hear from women fretting about the exact time, daily or monthly, that the herbs should be taken, whether they need “on and off” schedules, whether the herbs should be taken with food or without. None of these things make any particular difference in effectiveness. What does matter is taking the herbs consistently every day, and using massage in your program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Avoiding caffeine, carbonated beverages and chocolate? We have never been clear on why so many of those formula companies make these statements. Our theory is that one of them posted this rule and the rest of them copied it. Caffeine is fine in moderation, though it can contribute to breast tenderness, so limit it if this is a problem for you. Carbonated beverages have no effect on the program, though there are better things for your diet. And chocolate, especially dark chocolate, contains flavenoids that can actually be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Herbal quality. You really aren’t doing yourself a favor by getting cheap herbs at a discount store. Read the ingredients. There are fillers and additives, the herbs are often irradiated to kill bacteria, and potency varies widely. The only ingredients that you need are the herbs, in a potent form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. No one can tell you exactly how this will work for you or how long it will take. In our eight years of experience with the herbs we have found that about half the women who use the program see results within two to six weeks. Another 30 percent have to work a little harder or wait a little longer, increasing doses, etc. The other twenty percent will generally see results with a diligent effort. We never give up since we have seen women have difficulties for long periods and then suddenly start to see improvements. There are a few things that will give you a clue however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. You can get some idea of your size limit by looking at other women in your gene pool. You may be able to match or exceed the larger breasted women in your family, but generally no one is going to become a DD in a family of B’s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B. Women of all ages can see improvements, but we have noticed that the period just before menopause, mid to late forties, can hamper things a bit. Women in this age group have slowing hormone production and often need higher doses of the herbs than normal. On the bright side, the herbs often lessen or eliminate menopausal symptoms making the transition easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C. Women with high metabolism and low body fat, or with very strenuous exercise programs often need higher doses of the herbs and seem to take longer to see good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D. Poor diet and smoking can slow results. Your body needs a well balanced diet to promote healthy breast tissue. Fruits, vegetables and whole grains are very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;- See more at: http://www.greenbush.net/10thyounetok.html#sthash.MG06u5hs.dpuf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have cleared that up, moving on to the actual review of this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains 8 ingredients that have been used for breast enlargement in other products like the ever-so-popular Breast Actives and are known to work for some women. The combination of herbs gives this a strong odor but personally I quite likeit. But please do your own research on these ingredients! I can&#x27;t imagine why someone wouldn&#x27;t want to know what is going in their body. Not that anything bad is included in this, just make sure you know all the effects that will take place. For instance, fenugreek can lower your cholesterol which may not be bad unless you already have low cholesterol...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The capsule itself is quite large but still easy to swallow so don&#x27;t feel too intimidated by it. I actually had a few extra capsules (yes I counted them all out! Lol) and decided to mix them up with aloe vera gel to use as a massage gel. Which if you didn&#x27;t read somewhere already, massage helps stimulate growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what herbs work for me with my natural breast enlargement (NBE) regime after experimenting with one herb at a time for three months each. And after taking so many supplements daily, I kind of felt like being lazy and searched around for an &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; supplement. This product happens to have the main herbs that work for me the best and is quite cheap compared to the other products around on the web. So I gave it a shot. It has definitely been working for me, but again, that&#x27;s because I know the herbs contained in this product work great with my body! If you want actual results from a product like this, you NEED to experiment with one herb at a time so you know what &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; supplement will work best!! Don&#x27;t just say &amp;#34;this product doesn&#x27;t work at all!!&amp;#34; and leave it one star. It just ruins the rating on a product that is actually quite good for the price! With NBE, what you try may not work for you, but it will work for someone else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, with this product I have been taking it for one month and already feel it working and have grown about half an inch. I took a break for one month before trying it and detoxed my body to make sure I was &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; from all the other herbs I took. So I know it&#x27;s this product giving me results and not any &amp;#34;left overs&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use this product for the full three month supply, I will update with pictures (bare chested but nipples covered) and measurement growth overall.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two and a half months. So far, I am gaining weight everywhere including my stomach. Even though that is unfortunately happening, my breast are getting slightly bigger. I will give this product more time and let you guys know the ending results.</li>
    <li> Some days it seems like it&#x27;s working, &amp; other days it doesn&#x27;t. The seller is great though. I got my next 3 bottles on the same day that I ran out!</li>
    <li> Bad taste and bad aftertaste...on bottle 2 dont see anything...:(</li>
    <li> It made my breasts fuller and I filled out my bra more so that was nice but you do have to stay on top of taking them!</li>
    <li> My bust get bigger but also my waist and everything else... :(</li>
    <li> Waste of money did nothing.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have been using it while dieting to help maintain my breast size and to try and prevent sagging. My breasts kept their volume and became a little more lifted, I do not know if it increases breast size though. It&#x27;s a good idea to take this product at the same time everyday so your body knows when to expect it (same as birth control). This product is easily worth the money in my eyes. Remember that this review is based on my body and you may have different results.</li>
    <li> does work, have patience</li>
    <li> It may not work for everyone, but it is working for me. Slow but surely, I can see and feel a little difference in my breasts, I&#x27;m a transgender male who lives and dresses fulltime as a woman out in public everyday, and other people notice the difference in my appearance also</li>
    <li> Been using for three and a half weeks and I&#x27;ve seen almost half an inch growth. My smaller one is slowly catching up to the larger.</li>
    <li> I finished the entire three bottles as directed and noticed some changes. My breast are a little fuller but the firmness is not there. They are full but saggy. That is disappointing. I did notice the hot flashes cooling off and my mood is a little better. That is the plus! I will not try this product again and hope the results remain. I like the fullness just not the sagging. Exercise will take care of that part.</li>
    <li> Shipped in quick! Started using them yesterday so let&#x27;s see if they work! I will update when I am finished with the bottles! (:</li>
