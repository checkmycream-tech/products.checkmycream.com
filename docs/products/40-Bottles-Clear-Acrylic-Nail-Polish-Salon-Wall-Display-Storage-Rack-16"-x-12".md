      <li>everything is easily within reach.</li>

      <li>All in all I love this product was just the right size for me and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the shelf is fine and works well when it does not arrive in pieces - but I would stay far away from Salon Supply Store.</li>

      <li>Exactly as shown!</li>
      <li>Completely bogus, the box was in fine condition.  </li>
      <li>It arrived so fast and is exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>First the seller Salon Supply Store.</li>
      <li>Good heavy acrylic.</li>
      <li>I enjoy keeping my nails painted, and my three daughters do too, so we have quite a rainbow of polish bottles, and it was getting a little out of control.  :)</li>
      <li>I do my nails at home, used to go to salon and bring my own polish, using other peoples polish sleeves me.  </li>
      <li>I mounted it on the wall in the bathroom, and now all the bottles of polish have a place to go and we can easily view all of the colors to pick our next one each time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>I emailed them and in less than 24 hours I had a very nice email from them back.</li>
      <li>but my bottles are mostly OPI or other brands of bottles</li>
      <li>what a great gift!&amp;#34; I personally only have half of the nail colors purchased in the sellers picture, but I want a polish rack for myself, but smaller.</li>
      <li>Wish it was a little bit cheaper because it is kinda small that I have to buy another one, but its good either way!</li>
      <li>I received this as a Christmas gift  for my new bedroom to dressing room conversion.</li>
      <li>My top shelf has odd sz smaller bottles</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and was packed extremely well.</li>
      <li>really keeps everything organize instead of having all your nail polishes in a tiny box like i did.</li>
      <li>came fast holds lot of nail polish&#x27;s all different sizes.</li>
      <li>Just &amp;#34;man up&amp;#34; and take responsibility for your own broken merchandise!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Quite sure it was broken when packed by Salon Supply Store.  </li>
      <li>The only issues was the top corner was broken when i got it, thats why they got 3 stars.</li>

    <li> This is a nice piece to have to help organize all the nali polish we ladies like to have! The only issues was the top corner was broken when i got it, thats why they got 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I used this to store my reinkers  Tim Holtz distress ink fits and everything is easily within reach.</li>
    <li> I am going to write this in two parts. First the seller Salon Supply Store. I got the item broken, I knew it was broken when the Fed Ex guy came it shouldn&#x27;t have shook. I emailed them and in less than 24 hours I had a very nice email from them back. With in a week I had my replacement one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the product. It is larger than my other one I got last year. I like that it holders more bottles and has more space between each shelf. I use two rows to store all my Young Living Essential Oils it holds 10-11 of the bigger bottles and about 13 of the smaller ones. One row holds all of my daughters Piggy Paint and it holds everything she owns plus 4 tiny bottles of OPI. The last row holds my overflow of OPI nail polish from the other small rack I got else where last year. I love this one and already asking my husband if I can get another one to hold spices. My mother also commented how nice it looked in my bathroom and asked where I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also comment this rack has 4 screws to hold it up and my other little smaller one only has 2. I like the 4 much better, it holds it really good in place.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was packed extremely well. Love it. A def must have for the nail polish collector or make up diva.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail polish rack!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to hang it and start filling it up.&lt;br /&gt;Very spacey</li>
    <li> Shipped SO QUICKLY!!! There were many options of nail polish wall displays to choose from - and I am glad I chose this one!! It arrived so fast and is exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift  for my new bedroom to dressing room conversion. I love being able to see all my colors. Sturdy construction and easy to mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came back to Amazon and bought one for my daughter and a friend!</li>
    <li> The display tray came cracked in one corner. After writing an email to customer service, I was told to wait and file a claim with FedEx, even tho it was zero fault of mine. This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my wife, how embarrassing it was to tell her that her gift was broken and no one knows when it&#x27;ll be replaced. After waiting for 1.5weeks to finally get info on how to file a claim with FedEx, I got another email stating that the item is OOS now and I&#x27;m getting a refund instead. Bogus situation and questionable customer service</li>
    <li> I must say this rack is beautiful as a nail polish rack it looks like a art picture frame when fill with the wonder assortment of nail polishes. I feel like taking a picture to show it off to friends. Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely Meme :-)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite purchase&#x27;s becuse not only is it a useful product, it has helped to make me more organized and freed up space. I have it mounted on the wall and it beautifully displays all my bottles of nail polish. The only thing I would disagree with is the fact that they claim it holds 40 bottles of polish. If the bottles are small or skinny then yes it would but not if the bottles are Orly size. There are 4 shelves so that would be 10 bottles per shelf but my bottles are mostly OPI or other brands of bottles that size &amp; I can only get 9 bottles in a row. My top shelf has odd sz smaller bottles so there yes I can get 10 bottles mybe even 11 if I stagger then like forward, back, forward &amp; back. All in all I love this product was just the right size for me and would recommend it. The acrylic is sturdy and came with screws for mounting. i mounted it myself within miniutes.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this would work well or not - it arrived with a corner of the acrylic broken off in an obviously undamaged box.  Quite sure it was broken when packed by Salon Supply Store.  Went through the process of filing a damaged merchandise report, sent in five photos as requested.  Response today?  &amp;#34;We believe the damage was caused by shipping and have filed a claim with Fedex.&amp;#34;  Completely bogus, the box was in fine condition.  Now a third party is involved and I have to wait until they go through all those processes AND hold on to the box and packaging so FedEx can come &amp;#34;inspect it.&amp;#34;  ANNOYING.  Just &amp;#34;man up&amp;#34; and take responsibility for your own broken merchandise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the shelf is fine and works well when it does not arrive in pieces - but I would stay far away from Salon Supply Store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very handy!! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I Love this nail Polish Holder! Wish it was a little bit cheaper because it is kinda small that I have to buy another one, but its good either way!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my sister for Christmas. She keeps her nails painted. Her response was &amp;#34;who thinks of this? what a great gift!&amp;#34; I personally only have half of the nail colors purchased in the sellers picture, but I want a polish rack for myself, but smaller.</li>
    <li> came fast holds lot of nail polish&#x27;s all different sizes. it looks like and works perfectly. I love it a lot! might buy another one when my collection grows :)</li>
    <li> This bottle display/organizer is great.  It is exactly what I ordered and helps organize my bottles perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these are they are great</li>
    <li> absolutely love this, perfect for us nail polish lovers! really keeps everything organize instead of having all your nail polishes in a tiny box like i did.</li>
    <li> This product is great. My tee daughter hung it in her room and it holds all her nail polish. It is also very stylish looking. I want one now to hang in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> My daughter was tired of keeping her polishes in a box and this fit the ticket perfectly. There was a blank spot on one wall in the perfect spot. She is thrilled.</li>
    <li> i have two. Sturdy and i like them!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to store my nailpolish - looks great mounted in my walk-in closet.</li>
    <li> I put this up on the wall and it held even though the wall I put it on was thin. Also, it was easier to not use the green screw cushions because I was looking at them and when I tried to use them, they broke.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use the supplied hardware to hang it. I couldn&#x27;t get the drywall plastic pieces into the wall and ended up bending the heck out of them without getting them entirely into the wall. I suggest you purchase your own if you need to use drywall screws. I used a stud for one screw and a drywall screw for the other. I have no complaints about the rack. It looks nice and was the right size for my nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> I do my nails at home, used to go to salon and bring my own polish, using other peoples polish sleeves me.  So I have quite a collection and these hold all my polishes</li>
    <li> I enjoy keeping my nails painted, and my three daughters do too, so we have quite a rainbow of polish bottles, and it was getting a little out of control.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was perfect! I mounted it on the wall in the bathroom, and now all the bottles of polish have a place to go and we can easily view all of the colors to pick our next one each time,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality acrylic, mounted very easily.</li>
    <li> Good heavy acrylic. The fit nailpolishes perfectly, but I&#x27;m using mine to hold my collection of essential oils and tinctures and it works really well for these too!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!!  Exactly as shown!</li>
