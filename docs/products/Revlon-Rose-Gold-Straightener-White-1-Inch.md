      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the gold/copper plates are a gimmick or not, but I know for a fact that copper is one of the best heat conductors.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In comparison to other Revlon straighteners that I&#x27;ve owned, this one stands up to my favorites. I like the copper plates and they heat quickly which is a huge plus for me. The iron itself has a sturdy quality and doesn&#x27;t feel like it will fall apart and the plates hold hair firmly while in use and don&#x27;t have a lot of give, nor do they pull hair or snag. This is a well made unit that works easily. It doesn&#x27;t have a digital thermometer, and I really like those, but for straightening, this works great. The dial for the heat setting is easy to use and is a little large which makes it easier if you don&#x27;t like tiny dials where you cant see the numbers of the settings (like me). The heating plates themselves are smaller than on the average hair straightener and can make styling more time consuming.  You have to be careful that all of your hair is actually on the plate and not put too much hair in the plates where some of it ends up on the setting control unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like this iron for the ease of use and the copper plates are a cool feature. The iron looks really nice and is a sturdy unit. The plates are a bit shorter so it may take longer to use but I don&#x27;t think this is a huge hindrance just harder if pressed for time to be careful that you&#x27;ve put your hair on the plates correctly if you are used to longer plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really good tool for hair and I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually straighten my hair, but I have helped my daughters do theirs.  This Revlon Rose Gold straightener works really well, especially for this price. I did use it myself, and like that it has an on-off switch, as well  a temperature-adjusting dial. It worked fairly well on my wavy hair, but I used a lower temperature setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 19 year old daughter has been using it and getting great results. She also has wavy hair, but she has more experience with straightening hers. She said it reminded her of her roommate&#x27;s CHI straightener.  She is very pleased with it, and with the results she gets!</li>
    <li> This straightener doesn&#x27;t strike me as being as durable as my other, however, it heats up quickly and does a nice job straightening my hair. The cord is a good length and it looks like it will withstand the normal wear and tear straighteners receive. It has automatic turn off and heats up very quickly. It&#x27;s also relatively compact because of the 1&amp;#34; surface plates.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener heats up quickly and works well. There are several heat settings. It leaves my hair manageable, straight, and smooth. It is a nice product and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is awesome as a curler, it&#x27;s a great size, and kept my curls! I would however prefer that this would be wider to straighten, my current straightener is wider but pretty old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This heats up quickly and I was impressed with it keeping the heat, unlike my current one that I have to &amp;#34;let rest&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the dial, I wish there was an electronic one, I keep moving the dial with my wrist.</li>
    <li> I like the look of this flat iron. The white with the rose gold plates looks nice. It is only a 1&amp;#34; straightener, so the plates aren&#x27;t that large. They are sturdy and heat up quickly. At just under $30 it is in the affordable range of straighteners. The plastic is light weight, which is good for your arm when using it, but it also makes it feel cheap.  My hair is already pretty straight, so I just need the straightener to make my hair look polished.  This does an okay job straightening my hair. It takes a little longer since, it&#x27;s only 1&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve never owned an expensive straightener, so I don&#x27;t know how much better they work than an inexpensive one.  I do like the swivel cord. It helps keep the cord from getting twisted when moving the iron around your head. This goes up to 450 degrees so if you have fine hair like mine, keep the heat setting low. If you have thick or coarse hair, use the higher temps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It you have a limited budget and need a smaller straightener, this 1&amp;#34; may be for you. It gets hot, but all that heat might not be needed for thinner hair. This straightener does work, it just takes time to get through your whole head. So I would recommend using a larger sized straightener if doing your whole head and the 1&amp;#34; for finishing or touch ups.</li>
    <li> This flat iron has a cheap plasticky feel to it. When I first picked it up, I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not sure this is very high quality.&amp;#34; However, it proved me wrong. It did a fantastic job of quickly heating to a high temp. I especially love the auto-off feature (that way I don&#x27;t have to panic about not being able to remember if I turned the iron off or not . . .obviously, you still want to make sure the iron is off before you leave it unattended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the straightening itself, it did a great job of taming my natural waves. It smoothed the hair and produced a sleek straight look. I thought it was fantastic. The cord is plenty long and the iron size was just what my medium length hair needed.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine, thick, shoulder length, and is all over the place. I try to avoid straighteners for daily use because I&#x27;m not sure continued and persistent use of a straightener is very good for one&#x27;s hair. However, when I go out a straightener is a necessity.&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth this is one of the nicest appliances I have used to tame my crazy hair. While it lacks a digital display, it has a nice control that lets me adjust it to the desired temperature for my hair. The control is also large enough for me to view it without glasses. It heats up quickly in about 30 seconds. The construction is substantial and the pad clamps the hair as it is drawn over the plate. The plate is copper. From what I understand copper is a good conductor and that  seems to be true. This styler maintains the proper temperature and makes styling a snap from my perspective. While nothing will ever be easier than &#x27;wash and blow dry&#x27; or going to get my hair styled, the results I got from this hair straightener were great the first time I used it and that  held true for subsequent uses. Not only is my hair straight, but it also has volume after using this styler.&lt;br /&gt;An additional plus is that the power cord is ample and so far I have not experienced dry hair, split ends, or broken hair. My hair even looks shinier.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have to say this is well priced and well made hair appliance that does what it claims.</li>
    <li> This straightener works really well for the price. It heats up quickly and there are several heat settings. The device heats up to 450 degrees so it&#x27;ll work on any hair type. It leaves my hair very manageable after being straightened without frizz. This straightener does the same job as many of the expensive ones. If you want a great straightener at a great price then pick up the Revlon Rose Gold Straightener.</li>
    <li> Usually once you find that perfect flat iron it is hard to switch to using anything else, This has been the case for me since I am so in love with my Conair Infinity Pro flat iron that I have been using for years! I decided to give this specific flat iron a try just to see if I would get even better results and I&#x27;m happy to say that I did, My hair came out more sleek than usual and it looked very professional. I had lots of body and movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I really like about this flat iron is that it grips your hair really good from the roots. You wont have to worry about the rest of your hair being straight yet having frizzy or puffy roots. It heats up very quickly up to 450 and has an auto shut off. The swivel cord is great for maneuvering and does not tangle easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found to be quite annoying was that my red indicator light will not stop flashing once it was fully heated and ready for use. I have no idea why and the instruction booklet did not explain this, speaking of the instruction booklet, everything is very basic and straightforward. I also noticed that my heat control dial was very loose and cheaply made, It felt like it would break or stop working any minute. So be careful when turning this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was very satisfied with the results I got from using this Rose Gold Straightener, I will continue to alternate between this and my Infinity Pro.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to discover that this reasonably priced Revlon straightener delivered results on par with &#x27;fancier&#x27; ceramic devices that cost 3-4 times more. Truth be told, this is a straightforward, no-frills type device. There&#x27;s no digital display, timers, or any other option aside from a manual dial to adjust one of the 30 heat levels. Still, this device is up to task in the areas that matter most - it heats up very fast, the gold/copper surfaces evenly conducts heat across its length and width and the unit itself feels nice and sturdy. Great value and performance all around.</li>
    <li> My wife does not really style her hair after giving birth to our daughter, and her straight hair, well just about remains straight in a un-managed style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this for her, she looked at me sheepishly and immediately got the hint. So for our date night tonight, she used this fairly lightweight Revlon straightener, and man I did not know what she did with her hair, but it just looks styled, polished and even has a little bit of shine and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was definitely happy with the product though she did comment initially that it looks plastic-y and cheap, and even feel fragile since it was fairly light. But she likes the ease of use and the end result it did with her straight and quite fine hair.</li>
    <li> The best part of this iron is that I can straighten or curl my hair instead of over-washing it.  Otherwise, I end up having to wash it just to get it back down again, even when it doesn’t need shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not my favorite straightener, because it doesn’t do anything special and it feels small even though it is the same size as the others that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good basic straightener.  I liked how quickly it heated up and that it didn’t feel hot to my touch.  It is also nice to have auto shut off.  I definitely walk off and forget things.</li>
    <li> Nobody has addressed the fact that the plates meet up completely without a lot of squeezing pressure.  I like that.  Some of the other ones I saw on display only touched on the ends unless one squeezed it hard.  I&#x27;m using this to tame the new growth that is short and flyaway.  Because the plates are shorter than other straighteners I feel I have more control over it and so far I love it.  I wished it came with a cloth sleeve for travel and that it locked when in storage.  But for the price I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> The Revlon Rose Gold Straightener is compact, easy to maneuver, and fits nicely in my hand. It has a swivel cord, auto shutoff after one hour, and variable heat selections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plates distribute heat evenly and have a bit of give, or float, which allows me to get a firm grip on my hair. Despite the firm grip, my hair slides smoothly and doesn&#x27;t catch or stick. The one inch plates are not overly large which is perfect for styling my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this flatiron for its simplicity. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle. It does not have a digital temperature readout, but instead has a dial with 30 heat settings. It does not get as hot as my old Chi iron, but with my shorter hair I don&#x27;t need the extra high heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turning the iron on or off is done with a basic toggle switch. If I could come up with any complaint at all, it would be that the temperature dial moves a little too freely, and if bumped between uses will move up or down a few settings. Other than that, this is the perfect straightener for me, and I&#x27;ve tried more than a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rose Gold Straightener has many of the features of the high priced straighteners, but at a very reasonable price that won&#x27;t break the budget. Although it&#x27;s plastic and looks inexpensive, looks can be deceiving - this is a very nice hair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 2016&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this daily for the past two years and it is still going strong, and still my favorite flatiron.</li>
    <li> The main reason I ordered this straightener was because it was advertised as &amp;#34;dual voltage,&amp;#34; and I wanted to use it for foreign travel.  However, when it arrived, there was nothing on the outside of the package that said it was &amp;#34;dual voltage,&amp;#34; and I hesitated to open it, thinking that I might want to send it back.  I did go ahead and open the package.  There still was no mention on the straighter itself or in the instructions about it being &amp;#34;dual voltage.&amp;#34;  In fact, one of the instructions said not to use it with a voltage converter, which essentially told me that it was not made for worldwide travel.  I&#x27;ve decided to keep the straightener as a back-up for the one I use in the U.S., but I&#x27;m disappointed that now I&#x27;m going to have to buy another straightener that really does have &amp;#34;dual voltage.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the good:  This hair straightener works well.  The copper plates are smooth and have yet to snag my hair, even after a good amount of use.  For the price, you probably can&#x27;t get a better hair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it has a very plastic feel to it.  It has yet to fall apart on me, but it feels like it could.  In addition, there&#x27;s not a lot of heat control on this model.  My hair is especially prone to heat damage, and I&#x27;m afraid to use this hair straightener very often, because there&#x27;s not the option to set the heat as low as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as the high priced ceramic straighteners but doesn’t burn your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device heats up to 450 degrees so it will work on any hair, and if used properly, it shouldn’t burn the hair.  However, like any heated device, if you leave it too long in one spot, it can scorch the hair.  The trick is to keep the device sliding on the hair—don’t stop in one spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener works great and is easy to handle.  It heats up fast, and the one inch surface makes this a full-size product.</li>
    <li> This Revlon Rose Gold Straightener works well on my daughter&#x27;s thick, shoulder length hair. Here are her observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Looks good, compared to normal straighteners&lt;br /&gt;+ Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;+ Works well&lt;br /&gt;+ Swivel cord makes it easy to position where needed&lt;br /&gt;- Small plates require more time to do all of her hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very good looking and perfectly functional hair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> I chose this straightener for my daughter and she loves it.  She has thick hair so it usually takes her quite a bit of time with her old straightener.  Revlon Rose Gold Straightener works faster, has several heat settings and the results are long lasting.  This is an affordable hair styling product that gives you fantastic results.  I would absolutely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon styling appliances since the 90&#x27;s and I love the brand as it tends to be reliable and affordable. I guess I can&#x27;t compare it to much as I&#x27;ve never shelled out $100 for some of the high end stuff. I got this particular straightener to replace a different Revlon straightener that had a digital display. The problem with the digital one was that the buttons stopped working and I had a lot of trouble programming the temperature and turning the thing on and off. This straightener has a standard on/off switch and a dial to set the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the aesthetics of this straightener, it&#x27;s got a pearl finish with a gold sheen to it and is very nice looking. I&#x27;m not sure if the gold/copper plates are a gimmick or not, but I know for a fact that copper is one of the best heat conductors. It certainly seems to heat up quickly, and the nonstick plates have not gotten covered in hair product residue yet (which tends to be a problem for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it, and would recommend it. It&#x27;s affordable and since it has standard controls (not digital), I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll have some longevity as there&#x27;s less to break. f you&#x27;ve never used a straightener before, you should know that 1&amp;#34; straighteners are recommended for people with short hair.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, and the dial helps to customize the heat needed for my hair.  Seems to be a little more stable than my old straightener too, and I like the loop at the end...it makes storage simple.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently tested out a few fancy styling irons with all kinds of bells and whistles and promises of performance, and they were a lot more than what I needed and tended to damage my fine hair. All I really wanted was a small flat iron, easy to maneuver, that would straighten out my cowlicks and put a nice bend in the ends of my hair. This simple Revlon Rose Gold Straightener turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use a setting between 1 and 6 for fine hair like mine. I set it at 5, waited a minute or two (didn&#x27;t time it), and the unit was hot and ready to go. They say to heat fine, thin hair for 5 to 8 seconds as you go, but I found my hair didn&#x27;t really need that much time because I&#x27;m not trying to straighten any super unruly curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener is lightweight and easy to use because it&#x27;s smaller than some of the fancier units. I found it easy to maneuver, styled my bangs, got my cowlicks tamed, and put a slight bend in the ends of the longer part of my hair. Perfect. I will continue to play around with heat settings, but for now I&#x27;m satisfied with the setting at 5 or 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often have hairspray residue in my hair, so I tested out how this iron works in that situation, and had no problems. Of course, you have to be vigilant about cleaning that residue off the plates so it doesn&#x27;t build up. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product so far, and would recommend it for someone who wants just the basics, plus a super fast heat-up time. It seems to cool off pretty quickly too, and will shut off automatically if you abandon it for an hour. Nice feature for forgetful people.</li>
    <li> Revlon&#x27;s Rose Gold 1 inch Straightener has proved to be a welcome addition to my beauty routine.  Easy to use, and fast styling.  My hair felt very good afterward, not dried out or fragile.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair – it is currently halfway down my back. My hair has some natural curl to it – just enough to make it a bit unruly unless I spend time styling it. I’ve never been able to get away with a ‘wash and go’ hair style. I like to play around with my style and do something different frequently. Sometimes I roll my hair in big Velcro rollers, sometimes I use hot rollers, occasionally I scrunch it to make it kinky, and I frequently use a flat iron in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a misconception that flat irons are strictly for straightening hair, but that isn’t really so. They are really more for smoothing the hair. I use mine to smooth my hair and even make some subtle waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon Rose Gold Straightener, White, 1 Inch is a good flat iron. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. It worked very well on my hair, which is fine. Although fine, I have a lot of hair. It does take some time to use the flat iron on my hair, but that is true of any styling device I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m happy with this flat iron and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone who is in the market for one.</li>
    <li> I have super curly hair but this flat iron made it straight as a stick. It heats up fast and is easy to use.</li>
