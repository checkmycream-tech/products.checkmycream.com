      <li>Very nice and lovely light smell.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the light consistency...also love the spray application!</li>
      <li>I think that the body butter of this brand is more moisturizing than the milk body lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;pleasant smell not toooooo coconutty :)</li>
      <li>Love this stuff use it all the time&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
      <li>I love a whiff of coconut oil.</li>
      <li>I love anything that smells like coconut</li>

      <li>The smell is ok</li>
      <li>Nonetheless this is one of the best lotions I ever bought, just wish there was more to last!</li>
      <li>I wish more came out at a time though.  </li>
      <li>i love this lotion.</li>
      <li>u will love this..</li>
      <li>if you spray some on an arm and rub that in, you&#x27;ll never be able to either hold the bottle or keep a finger on the plunger &#x27;cause</li>
      <li>Lovely for summer...</li>
      <li>I just like to use it for the smell :)</li>
      <li>I use it every day now, mostly because it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant, and the lotion moisturizes really well.</li>
      <li>the smell is too strong, I don&#x27;t like it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a light coconut lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell overpowering and isn&#x27;t tainted with mango, vanilla, floral,(whatever) scents...not easy to find.  </li>
      <li>so I still had to lightly redistribute the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an extremely light spray lotion.</li>
      <li>I find it also to be really great moisturizer... not greasy... but really sinks in and lasts.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells and it is very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>lotion itself is light and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin soft and smelling lovely.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into my skin so quick and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue - it&#x27;s like</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t just spray it on the skin, you will need to rub it in, but it rubs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or slimy feeling.</li>
      <li>EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED GOOD PRODUCT.·:*¨¨*:·&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a spray lotion and this is the only one I could find.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>one more relaxing, the other more energizing.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s had to spray, it doesn&#x27;t smell right.  </li>
      <li>my skin just drinks it right in.</li>
      <li>Smells exactly like coconuts and sweet milk..easy and gentle</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love the smell (obviously you have to like coconut).</li>
      <li>Although these two issues are lightened by the fact that if scent is what your after more than moisturizing effects, you can easily get away with using far less and still smelling heavenly for hours.</li>
      <li>The product was very watery and not at all moisturizing.</li>
      <li>My hands get very chapped in the winter.  </li>
      <li>But the smell of this is so strong it gave me a headache even though I just squirted a few drops onto my arm when I first got it.</li>
      <li>and I like the new spray lotion thing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Out of curiosity, I tried just adding water to cheap coconut lotion in a spray bottle and achieved roughly the same results.</li>
      <li>I also use it after I taking a shower, put on  body, and makes body so soft.</li>
      <li>I really like this &amp; have ordered a second bottle.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is like watered down its not really a lotion I would say for moisturizing but more for like scent</li>
      <li>I have pretty dry skin, especially during the winter.  </li>
      <li>Was not what I expected from the product , really since it had coconut in it.</li>
      <li>I have really dry skin though so someone with normal skin may find this enough.</li>

<li> Yes, it&#x27;s thin</li>
<li> With the cold weather, I mix his lotion with organic Coconut Oil to reemphasize the moisturizing properties.</li>

    <li> The smell is amazing! Every time I use it I get complimented! I think that the body butter of this brand is more moisturizing than the milk body lotion. Which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I have really dry skin though so someone with normal skin may find this enough. I just like to use it for the smell :)</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the light consistency...also love the spray application!</li>
    <li> Very delicious, strongish, authentic coconut milk fragrance.  I find it also to be really great moisturizer... not greasy... but really sinks in and lasts. In fact, I feel its a perfect moisturizer. Lovely for summer... just perfect. I got both the Satsuma and this one on the same day, and because I couldnt decide which to wear I put them both on. Turned me into an orange soda coconut ice cream float.  I don&#x27;t mind smelling this delicious though.  My boyfriend doesnt mind either.  I probably wont mix them in the future... because going THAT gormand isnt my usual preference These scents arent artificial smelling to my nose at all, which makes me willing to go with it today.  Each one alone is beautiful... one more relaxing, the other more energizing.&lt;br /&gt;One star off for small bottles and large price tag...  Although these two issues are lightened by the fact that if scent is what your after more than moisturizing effects, you can easily get away with using far less and still smelling heavenly for hours.</li>
    <li> the smell is too strong, I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> LIke pouring windex smelling butter on your skin!</li>
    <li> I love anything that smells like coconut and I like the new spray lotion thing. Good stuff! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a light coconut lotion that doesn&#x27;t smell overpowering and isn&#x27;t tainted with mango, vanilla, floral,(whatever) scents...not easy to find.  Since I use the Body Shop&#x27;s body butter during the winter months decided to try this.  Yes, it&#x27;s thin but how else would you get it to spray?  It&#x27;s a nice, light, fragrant lotion perfect for the summer months.  Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion b/c it can be sprayed on and it soaks up well. She says it seems to work well and I absolutely love the smell (obviously you have to like coconut).</li>
    <li> I have pretty dry skin, especially during the winter.  This is perfect!  i apply it as a base coat, then I add some coconut body butter on top.  It feels good, smells good and my skin is nice and smooth!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer for the summer months</li>
    <li> The smell is ok I was expecting it to be stronger and smell something like the tanning oils. The consistency is like watered down its not really a lotion I would say for moisturizing but more for like scent</li>
    <li> Smells great and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> i love this lotion. when i finish taking a shower i would spray this lotion all over my body...an i would smell like i jus came from a tropical island...i would recommend this 1000%...u will love this..an it stays on long...even my sister notice the scent on my skin, and my mom..u would not b disappointed...love it..</li>
    <li> My hands get very chapped in the winter.  I find this lotion to work the best.  I also use it after I taking a shower, put on  body, and makes body so soft.</li>
    <li> The cream is good stuff, but getting it on can be tricky.  Spritz all over and then rub it in &#x27;cause if you spray some on an arm and rub that in, you&#x27;ll never be able to either hold the bottle or keep a finger on the plunger &#x27;cause you&#x27;re just too slippery.  Forewarned is forearmed.</li>
    <li> At first, I was very skeptical about the high pricing for such a small bottle/content but the scent of this lotion is undeniable! Smells exactly like coconuts and sweet milk..easy and gentle all at the same time! With the cold weather, I mix his lotion with organic Coconut Oil to reemphasize the moisturizing properties. Nonetheless this is one of the best lotions I ever bought, just wish there was more to last!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only made 2 orders of this product, but I have received 4 orders and have been charged for it.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells and it is very moisturizing. It absorbs into my skin so quick and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue - it&#x27;s like my skin just drinks it right in. Love it!</li>
    <li> Everything works as described and I am very happy with my purchase.  I would recommend this to everyone who needs it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s had to spray, it doesn&#x27;t smell right.  I feel like someone mixed coconut oil with some crappy lotion, shook it up, slapped a sticker on it.  It&#x27;s not the quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from The Body Shop.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely light spray lotion. You can&#x27;t just spray it on the skin, you will need to rub it in, but it rubs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or slimy feeling. The scent is pleasant, and the lotion moisturizes really well. I noticed a difference in my skin within a week. I use it every day now, mostly because it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
    <li> The product was very watery and not at all moisturizing. Was not what I expected from the product , really since it had coconut in it.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and feels so good on my skin.  It is the &amp;#34;one I have been looking for&amp;#34; and I would purchase it again</li>
    <li> I really like this &amp; have ordered a second bottle.  I wish more came out at a time though.  Also, best to use right after you shower.</li>
    <li> smells really good  and is moisturizing. great product</li>
    <li> The scent of this lotion is wonderful--it smells like summer vacation in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is light and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin soft and smelling lovely. I was looking for something I didn&#x27;t need to rub in, however, so this wasn&#x27;t 100% what I had in mind. The sprayer concentrates the lotion in the middle of the steam so I still had to lightly redistribute the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of curiosity, I tried just adding water to cheap coconut lotion in a spray bottle and achieved roughly the same results. The scent wasn&#x27;t the same, though, so I&#x27;d still prefer this product simply for the smell alone.</li>
    <li> I love a whiff of coconut oil. But the smell of this is so strong it gave me a headache even though I just squirted a few drops onto my arm when I first got it.</li>
    <li> I really like the organic coconut and the wonderful fragrance, but I was expecting a creamier lotion. Probably wont buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff use it all the time&lt;br /&gt;not greasy or oily&lt;br /&gt;very light&lt;br /&gt;pleasant smell not toooooo coconutty :)</li>
    <li> *:·SUPER .·:*¨¨*:·.HAPPY CUSTOMER*¨¨*:··:*¨¨*A+++LOVE IT, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED GOOD PRODUCT.·:*¨¨*:·&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a spray lotion and this is the only one I could find.  Very nice and lovely light smell.</li>
