<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very reasonably priced. Fast service.</li>
    <li> The aftershave lotion has a wonderful aroma and does a great job of both soothing and adding a bit of refreshment to a your freshly shaven face.  The shaving soap lathers up well, especially if you use very hot water, and does a good job of preparing the face for shaving.  And the price is right.</li>
    <li> Great value.  The bottle is really big.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Tabac since 1967 and have received many others as gifts but none are as fresh and pleasant as this.  It is also not overpowering.  People often mention how nice it smells and ask me what it is.</li>
    <li> Such a masculine scent.</li>
    <li> This is a superb aftershave.  It is long-lasting while being quite subtle with it&#x27;s fragrance that is light.  I prefer this as an everyday scent using it after I&#x27;ve shaved using the Tabac shaving soap.  Family and friends have repeatedly expressed their delight in my \\&quot;smelling so good!\\&quot; after I&#x27;ve splashed the scent on.  A lot is not needed and the cooling effect after my shave definitely \\&quot;makes my day\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with razor burn following BBS shaving.  I have some difficult areas and to get the close shave I want, I get some razor burn.  This stuff helps quite a bit.  It burns less than other aftershaves upon initial application and quickly soothes the problem areas.  The scent is not my favorite, but that&#x27;s not the most important aspect to me and it is acceptable.  I will try other products, but I&#x27;ll be buying this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Tabac is not a common brand nowadays when you have the Tommy and the Polo brands taking over everyone&#x27;s life. Tabac is difficult to find in dept stores or shopping malls. So when I saw it at Amazon, I was very delighted. I ordered two bottles (the aftershave and the Eau de Toilette). I love the Tabac fragrance. Its original, simple, refreshing with a gentle and spicy feeling. Great to put on after a shower and in the evenings. I had no idea that 10 oz. was 100ml. The bottle is huge in the sense a very large quantity for the price (only $20). I checked the price at specialty perfume retailers and it was over $95! Even if you use it everyday (which I do) one 100ml bottle should last more than a year. Buy it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and wouldn&#x27;t change it  glad to see it&#x27;s now on amaOn too    wish list: amazon should also have the 3oz bottle or 1.7oz sampler for travelers</li>
    <li> As presented ~ no  issues, Thanks!</li>
    <li> Tabac is a wonderful aftershave. It smells lovely, fights razor burn very efficiently, is very discrete and light, lasts very long.</li>
    <li> My husband was looking for a new non-Old Spice type aftershave.  I found this one, and bought it on a whim.  He got it, and oh, my goodness I love it!! He laughs because I keep getting close to get a sniff!! LOL!! He says it is nice, but he wears it for me!!  It is not too heavy, very subtle and oh so yummy!!</li>
    <li> Best aftershave ever, my dad is been using this product for the past 40 years. Smells great and does the job !</li>
    <li> My husband wore this over 20 years ago..and was always his and mine favorite. They stopped carrying this at any of the stores in the midwest area. Did find in California once...years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy to find it again !!</li>
    <li> My dad is using this after shave for the past 40 years or more. Happy to found it on amazon. I m sending it to him over seas. It become very rare to found</li>
    <li> I have been using Tabac products for many years and really like them.  My favorites are their shaving cream, after shave, and cologne.  Definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is the best Men&#x27;s after shave fragance available. It is sweet and very mild. I have been using Tabac since 1988. I am glad that Amazon has the best price anywhere for this product. Many people ask me about my after shave, I&#x27;m hesitant to give the the name. I would not like everyone to have it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and I got 300 ml of it for an awesome price. It&#x27;s a classic that deserves a place in every man&#x27;s shave collection.  This is a superb aftershave. It is long-lasting while being quite subtle with it&#x27;s fragrance that is light. I prefer this as an everyday scent using it after I&#x27;ve shaved using the Tabac shaving soap. I find after I&#x27;ve splashed the scent on a lot is not needed and the cooling effect after my shave definitely &amp;#34;makes my day&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I really like Tabac and can only order it online.  This is great stuff.</li>
    <li> Comes in a very heavy, glass bottle (so you likely will not be taking the full sized bottle on vacation).  Good scent --- but does dissipate within a reasonable amount of time --- in case you want to wear an cologne.  I use it in concert with the Tabac shaving soap.  Enjoy</li>
    <li> My deceased dad wore this aftershave when I was a young adult. I just wanted to remember it and him when I gave it to my husband. He doesn&#x27;t care about it so much, but I still smell it for memories :)</li>
    <li> Tabac Original After Shave is sometimes difficult to find ... even in major urban areas. I have used the product for 20 years and when my supply would be getting low, I would go \\&quot;on the hunt\\&quot; for more.    This time, through Amazon, I ordered my new supply and received it within 4 days. This is the easiest and only way that I will get it again. The shipping and transit confirmations were welcome information and put me at ease with the process.    Well Done.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews on this site, I picked up a bottle of Tabac aftershave...to my regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It effectively fights razor burn, but at the price of having to smell the worst smelling aftershave since I once got confused and put Ben-Gay on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way to adequately describe the unpleasantness, but the nearest I can come is if you developed an astringent baby powder (baby powder combined with witch hazel?). What makes it worse, is that it is supposed to smell GOOD--which just makes the smell all the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, when you are cleaning out a slaughterhouse, you are expecting to smell horrible scents, and so you would be prepared for it. But, when you are still waking up in the morning and slap some Tabac on your face after your shave, you don&#x27;t expect to be the victim of olfactory assault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, to make it worse, I left it on in case the smell mellows as the alcohol dissipates; as a result of which, I had an entirely new horrible smell to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is repugnant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched for that old barber shop smell and I think this is the closest I&#x27;m going to get.  Very clean and crisp fragrance.</li>
    <li> My dad has been using it for years! It&#x27;s such a classic scent, and the price is so reasonable compared to others!</li>
    <li> I would say this is a floral/musk type of after shave and I love it very much. It is the first time I have ever purchased this kind and I am impressed.</li>
    <li> l love the way this smells on my hubby, light, not overpowering. Highly recommend. He tends to be a little heavy handed, and this stays pleasant.</li>
    <li> hope it is.  nice lite peaceful fragrant easy smooth classic  even a peasant would use it early in the am</li>
    <li> Sorry, not a fan of the scent at all. Too floral mixed with baby powder - I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the smell for hours, even on my fingers. Very nice bottle, quick shipping, all great.... just don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> The same after shave for over 50 years. Love it....</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not possible to objectively rate a smell that you&#x27;ve applied to yourself.  Maybe I&#x27;d have to smell it on someone else.  After all the great reviews, and with a reasonable price, I decided to give Tabac a try.  I just don&#x27;t see why anyone might go out of their way to find this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good.  I guess I could see it if it offered some kind of soothing effect, but it just doesn&#x27;t.  There are some really nice aftershaves out there...</li>
    <li> Tabac is a wonderful scent.  I use the shaving soap and the after shave.  No soap that I have tried lathers better.  The after shave does a great job of what an after shave should (soothing the skin after a shave) with the bonus of a great fragrance that is not too strong nor lasts too long.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product and it&#x27;s secure packing.  What can I say--he smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I love it, great product</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this stuff and it smells great! He has sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother him at all.</li>
    <li> I really like this after shave, and used to load up on it when I was in Germany.  Now I order it from Amazon get it in a fraction of the ime, and for less!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!  The smell brings back memories of my grandfather...classic sent.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites, a pleasantly scented manly aftershave...have been using for many years, my wife loves the way it has a nice smell. not overly powerful, like some of today&#x27;s men&#x27;s aftershaves..</li>
    <li> I thought that the fragrance might of changed, but the moment I smelt this aftershave I was transported back to Portobello Road, Notting Hill Gate and the late 70&#x27;s.  Such a lovely scent of our youth,.  Huge bottle, little $$&#x27;s... Love it.</li>
    <li> I got Tabac for a gift around 40 years ago but found it hard to find and stopped using it. After recently purchasing it on Amazon I was immediately reminded why I liked it. It&#x27;s a refreshing aftershave and has a great fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Was my favorite men&#x27;s product from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s but couldn&#x27;t find it in department stores since. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The five stars above clearly indicates my view of Tabac After shave. In my view, it&#x27;s the best all around brand.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient liked it.  It has a pleasant fragrance that is not too heavy.  He wears it to work and rides in a carpool with the guys!</li>
    <li> I have used this product since I started shaving and that was a fair few years ago! Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> These products are my husband&#x27;s favorite.  He was very excited to receive the aftershave as well as the Cologne Splash.</li>
    <li> The best feeling,used it for maybe 40 years,still feels good.</li>
    <li> For me, it&#x27;s either this or Old Spice...the bulk of those other scents out there &#x27;for men&#x27; are really just too girly...for your sister to wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Tabac Aftershave and Tabac Men&#x27;s Cologne since 1965. The light fragrance of both scents, in my opinion, is head and shoulders above any other men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same product for many years</li>
    <li> Product was provided as advertised, delivered on-time and perfectly packaged.</li>
    <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Wow. This is a great scent. Love it.</li>
    <li> Have ONLY used this aftershave since I first bought it in the early 70&#x27;s. Nothing else to touch it!</li>
    <li> I just received my shipment from the UPS man and I have to say that the smell is heavenly.  It pairs perfectly with the soap and is now one of my go-to AS&#x27;s.  This stuff is great!!!</li>
    <li> I love it, however my only issue is that it clearly says lotion on the description, packaging and bottle - BUT, it is definitely an After-Shave LIQUID! All, that said, I do really like the product and why I still rated it a 4 out of 5. It is alcohol based, but is very refreshing, not irritating at all and really doesn&#x27;t sting much compared to several others that I have used before. The scent is that old-time Tabac scent that we all know and love, not over powering, but still lasts through the whole day. My wife loves it! Perfect compliment to the shave soap and/or cream!</li>
    <li> This is NOT Aqua Velva or Old Spice. Very interesting, complex, strong scent at first. Very woodsy and spicy...almost incense-like. After a while the scent fades but is still noticeable. Very refreshing to skin when applied after the shave. Use sparingly...2 shakes max is all you need. Classy stuff.</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent for past 30 years. I have tried other mixtures in the past but always come back to this one</li>
    <li> I first was introduced to Tabac way back in the late 1950s while stationed in Germany with the US Army. I used it for several years here in the States but over the years in got harder and harder to find. So happy to find this product at such a reasonable price. Came well packaged to avoid breakage and arrived when promised. If you want comments from the ladies guys, give Tabac a try.</li>
    <li> Strong and powdery . Really really strong - like a 70&#x27;s disco star!</li>
    <li> A chick magnet, used it for 40 years</li>
    <li> Tabac.  From my mans shaving mug soap to body wash, deodorant, and the aftershave, my hubby is a Tabac guy.  That&#x27;s easy for me,naps it&#x27;s a wonderfully, light woodsy scent.</li>
    <li> As soon as I tried this horrific product I instantly became angry...at myself...for buying it, at Germany, for making it and at the World for not banning it. I think my Dad left me in the Barbary Coast in Vegas for an hour and every old drunkard in there must have had a gallon of it on, or I was locked in a room with some cast member from Saturday Night Fever in order for a rush of horrific memories to come to pass from just the odoriferous and vile pancreatic cancer in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon will not take it back as \\&quot;not as advertised\\&quot; because they said it is hazardous materiel, which is an understatement, but I guess its OK to send Hazardous Materiel to MY house ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a recommendation from an very educated friend of mine, little did I know he must have had inhaled Nitric Acid and his olfactory senses were completely destroyed, or he may have just used this for a week and the same thing happened. So I guess he gets a free bottle of TABAC next time I see him because I am afraid to mail this \\&quot;pain in a bottle\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God man I scrubbed my face and put on three coats of Bay Rum (for real men only) and I can still smell it, or more like FEEL it trying to come thru ! Creeping ...oooozn thru.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hes still my friend........</li>
    <li> This is a classic men&#x27;s fragrance that my husband was using in the &#x27;70s. No longer able to find it locally, Amazon.com is our source. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long but still very nice.</li>
    <li> It was all I hoped for and at a great price! Bought two!</li>
    <li> From what I&#x27;ve read online, this is a love it or hate it scent. I really love it. It has on old-fashioned barber shop type scent. It is clean and slightly spicy. It is also very soothing to the skin after a nice, close shave. I like to use it in conjunction with Tabac shaving soap but, it can stand on its own. An all-around, classic, manly scent. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Definitely old school. Reminds me of leather and some fruit. There is definitely musk too.&lt;br /&gt;Think of an upper class old lady dressed in a fur coat.</li>
    <li> Nice aroma, bottle design splashes just about the right amount per dash.  A distinctive look for the vanity counter top.</li>
    <li> I discovered this brand almost 30 years ago in the Middle East where it was very popular. Amazing product without being over-powering. Beats most $60-$70 competitors. Try it, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> One of the very, very few &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; aftershaves. By comparison most others smell like perfume.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for nearly 2 decades. I bought this from Germany also. What I have received is original stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product for ages, thanks to amazon, finally found it! The smell of this is unforgettable... brings back memories.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this at the ripe age of 18 stationed in Germany. I loved it then. Decades of time have gone by and Tabac had been forgotten. Just browsing Amazon one day, window shopping this mans way, from my recliner and I find this bottle that looks familiar. I loved this scent when i was 18. That was 1977.  I received it today and at the mature age of 55, still love it. For those of you who think this is an old mans scent, you are mistaken. i believed in 1977 this was way ahead of it&#x27;s time. It runs circles around any flowery garbage that&#x27;s being pushed upon us in the market today. Classic yes, Manly yes. Old man, not by a long shot. And i never met a woman that did not like it on her man. And now i have a piece of my youth back. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t stink up a room hours after you leave but it is remembered.....  I think that&#x27;s better thank making people choke...</li>
    <li> There seems to be a love or hate response to the Tabac scent. I love it and use the shaving soap daily. My only issue is the term \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; which in my mind means something with a little viscosity. This is a \\&quot;splash\\&quot; like regular after shave or cologne. What I was trying to buy (I now know) is the \\&quot;Balm\\&quot;. Maybe I&#x27;m the only one who didn&#x27;t know that, but just in case it&#x27;s good to know what you will be getting.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and comes in a large bottle but makes my skin a little sensitive. It dried me out a bit more than other alcohol based aftershaves for some reason but I still use on the weekends when its okay for me to look a little dry.</li>
    <li> Had to try it. Scent is subjective, but this one not for me.</li>
    <li> My dad used Tabac aftershave when I was little. I still remember the fine ceramic bottles on the bathroom shelf. Unfortunately, I never went for that classic fragrance... I was snagged early on by the Axes and Gillette concoctions... how a &#x27;cool&#x27; man is supposed to smell, and regrettably lost a large part of my youth to those and similar bland fragrances and aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years back, I turned to classic shaving and received a tube of Tabac shave cream as a gift. I loved the scent and tried to look for the aftershave but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and the few places I could find it, the price was really exorbitant. But Amazon came to the rescue and I found a great price on it so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still comes in that iconic ceramic bottle and the scent is just heavenly. I&#x27;m not so good at describing fragrances but you could search for it on basenotes etc. The scent is a bit powdery, spicy, and evokes memories of times long gone... good, honest, carefree and fun times. It doesn&#x27;t remind me of the 70&#x27;s or the 80&#x27;s or whatever... it really is a timeless scent. I apply it right after shaving and it doesn&#x27;t have that much of a sting or burn as my other aftershaves. It&#x27;s very soothing and leaves my face moisturized. After the initial application, the scent is reassuringly strong but it settles within 40 minutes to a subtle and elegant aroma that will not clash with any EDC I might also want to try. My better half loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and I got 300 ml of it for an awesome price. It&#x27;s a classic that deserves a place in every man&#x27;s shave collection.</li>
    <li> I realize that buying scents untested is a risky and subjective affair.  I won&#x27;t bash Tabac because it doesn&#x27;t work for me as a scent but I will give my humble opinion.  I didn&#x27;t feel it soothed my face or was invigorating.  Now onto the smell.  Very heavy floral top and middle notes.  I waited for the masculine base notes and found only a wood resin smell presenting itself on my skin.  This has no tobacco base notes on my skin as others have stated. I did not gather from the reviews that it was so heavy on the florals as I do not prefer floral scents.  Scent has a very synthetic feel.  After reading the ingredients I now know that I am not far off on the synthetic nature of this product. I lost on this one-- but I am content knowing that I am on a journey to try all the classic scents out there and sometimes certain ones don&#x27;t agree with you.  You do get a nice quantity for the price. Go with Pinaud Clubman or Old Spice over this for a classic inexpensive aftershave with a masculine scent. Clubman would be my first choice. Old spice second and a Bay Rum of your choice to round them out.  The shipper was fast and package was excellent.</li>
    <li> Now thats a man perfume! Very masculine and old school scent, i am pipe smoker and for some reason this scent hang on to me perfectly when others fail. Its a love hate kinda of scent for people (older generations find it more acceptable) but to me it was prefect!</li>
    <li> Great aftershave. Great price.</li>
    <li> Great classic after shave. Do you want to smell like a man? I mean a real man. One that could operate a chainsaw but doesn&#x27;t have to because he hired someone to do it for him. Want to smell familiar yet different? This is the scent. It sticks around a while but is not overpowering - it is an after shave after all.</li>
    <li> the value is awesome.  the ceramic is awesome, and matches my soap container perfectly.  This goes on smooth, and feels awesome.  It&#x27;s soothing with zero burn.  It comes with a powdery floural and masculine barbershop scent that lasts.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband but he does not use it. He likes the Tabac Balm which is not easy to get. It is a much better product</li>
    <li> Used it since college, my favorite fragrance.</li>
    <li> Excellent item. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this after being sent a sample - love the unique smell of this A/S.  You don&#x27;t need to use very much - and the scent lasts throughout most of the day.</li>
    <li> A girlfriend in Amsterdam, The Netherlands introduced me to this product &amp;#34;many, many&amp;#34; moons ago and I&#x27;ve been using it since then (when I could find it).</li>
    <li> A truly great  traditional musk scent for men!  Not fruity and spicy as are many of the newer brands and scents. A scent definitely for MEN only!</li>
    <li> Excwllwnt packing. Great Product!</li>
    <li> Exactly the product I was searching for on the web.</li>
    <li> Does not smell quite right and does not have the intensity or lasting power of the genuine Tabac.</li>
    <li> Tabac is a classic--very manly, very sophisticated.  The aftershave scent has some great staying power and is a perfect compliment to the soap.  This bottle is HUGE and will last quite a long time, even if you use it every day.</li>
    <li> The smell is anything but masculine unless you&#x27;re a male still hanging around in a crib. The reviews that it has a scent of baby powder are spot on. Its that smell, mixed with...... I can&#x27;t describe it. Maybe baby powder and another well known baby by-product. It actually made me sick. Bought the aftershave and shave soap because of the description of the scent. I figured with all the positive reviews it would be ok. IT IS NOT!!! It is horrible and I tossed it all out. Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t even give it away. Truly the worst scent I&#x27;ve ever smelled. The glass bottle was cool though.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the scent. Me? not as much. It&#x27;s floral and baby powder, sweet and cloying. It would make a better winter scent. The good news is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, about an hour, tops. It&#x27;s heavy in alcohol content and light in glycerin so it actually does a good job as a bracing, stinging aftershave, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on weekends when my wife is home with me. My wife gives it a 5 star, me a one star, which averages out to a 3 star review.</li>
