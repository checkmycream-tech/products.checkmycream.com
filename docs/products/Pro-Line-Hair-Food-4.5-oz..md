      <li>It&#x27;s good to put on right after I&#x27;ve washed my hair.</li>
      <li>But also it now smells more like a very pleasant skin lotion, and it actually smells quite good in my hair on a hot day</li>
      <li>Our Pro-Line-Hair Food purchase price was very good, and when we received it in a very short time.</li>

      <li>THANKS FOR THE SERVICE GUYS!</li>
      <li>but mine will still last for 2 more months .. .</li>
      <li>AS I DON&#x27;T THINK IT REALLY EXISTS!</li>
      <li>I applied a quarter-size amount right before going to bed to straight flat-ironed hair.</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair look and feel so much healthier.</li>
      <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t add to much if I were you.</li>
      <li>We were very please with everything.</li>
      <li>So I tryed it and really really works.</li>
      <li>From reading all the reviews, I thought this product would work really well.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and product looked as advertised.</li>
      <li>The cool thing about it is that it is actually like a hair treatment.  </li>
      <li>I have long wavy/curly hair, and I have to put mousse and some kind of product in it after washing so it doesn&#x27;t dry frizzy, and I thought that this would help make my hair healthy looking, manageable, and soft as advertized, but it had the complete opposite effect.</li>
      <li>but price is too high</li>
      <li>Even if your hair is fried, this little guy can make it look healthy as ever.</li>
      <li>After washing my hair thoroughly, I notice that my hair is much more tame and silky.  </li>
      <li>FIRST AND LAST TIME</li>
      <li>That is why I love it over the other similar products.</li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>Adding a little to your hair is just fine.</li>
      <li>Wake up and the hair I&#x27;m assuming absorbs it all because its soft, no longer heavy, not greasy AT ALL, wont frizz, and allows easy movement.</li>
      <li>Really, I don&#x27;t even need to put anything in it after washing, because the effects last forever.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now 51 years old</li>
      <li>It all feels so natural.</li>
      <li>I apply it and it does take a few hours to stop looking greasy but then looks fantastic.</li>
      <li>The grease is not heavy on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Have used this product sense I was 17 years old and in the Army.  </li>
      <li>So if are thinking of buying some it is not a waste of money because it works.</li>
      <li>I have blond hair that is very curly and gets brittle when it&#x27;s long.</li>
      <li>After waking up in the morning the product really improved the look, as long as the texture of my hair.</li>
      <li>It is light, gives my hair a sheen and require only small amounts.</li>

<li> After waking up in the morning the product really improved the look, as long as the texture of my hair.</li>
<li> It is light, gives my hair a sheen and require only small amounts.</li>
<li> Nothing about how much to apply (dried all glistening greasy the first time and had to re-shampoo and reapply teeny bit - still no good.</li>
<li> When you&#x27;re a guy with hair that isn&#x27;t quite long enough to weight itself down, its such a stress trying to cope with a way to keep it the way you want that you consider just getting that crew cut your relatives pester you about.    </li>
<li> I assumed it didn&#x27;t need to be washed out because all the other reviews said they left it in.</li>
<li> and I let it dry.</li>
<li> When I dry it, my hair poofs everywhere.  </li>
<li> Regular gel oozes and messes up my skin when I sweat.  </li>
<li> Hard to rate a product whose only instruction is not to press hair with it on.  </li>
<li> Really Greasy, Weird smell</li>
<li> My hair is thick and when cut short would stand on end.  </li>
<li> It is still soft but looks unhealthy and frizzy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve got thick, chin length, wavy hair that I started straightening, but I needed something to run through it to keep the frizz back and keep the wind from messing up my hair.</li>
<li> HAIR FOOD helped train my hair down.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was a little girl.  </li>
<li> Just put a little bit on your hand and work it through your hair.  </li>
<li> I put a little in after washing my hair</li>
<li> It makes your hair stiff and crusty.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t spend $10.00 when I purchased this in the past.  </li>
<li> It felt greasy, tangled, unmanageable, and my hair was dull looking.</li>
<li> The grease, isn&#x27;t a negative at all for me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m of mixed race and my hair is crazy curly.</li>
<li> I tried some pomades that helped a little but seemed either too greasy or not affective, not to mention expensive.</li>
<li> This is a very small bottle!  </li>
<li> Or maybe I can try putting it in BEFORE I wash my hair, because it looks terrible if left in.</li>
<li> so that&#x27;s nothing to think bad of.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>
<li> It made my hair disgusting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started using this product for the last 2 years. Its amazing. Nobody believes that there is a product like this but it works amazing. There is shortage of this product since a while. but mine will still last for 2 more months .. .</li>
    <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T RECIEVED MY PRODUCT YET! IT&#x27;S BEEN MORE THAN A MONTH NOW!!!    AND I CAN&#x27;T CALL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER AS I DON&#x27;T THINK IT REALLY EXISTS! MY MONEY IS GONE!    I THINK I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF.    FIRST AND LAST TIME I&#x27;LL BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON! THANKS FOR THE SERVICE GUYS!</li>
    <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t get over how great this stuff is for it&#x27;s price!     I&#x27;ve got thick, chin length, wavy hair that I started straightening, but I needed something to run through it to keep the frizz back and keep the wind from messing up my hair. When you&#x27;re a guy with hair that isn&#x27;t quite long enough to weight itself down, its such a stress trying to cope with a way to keep it the way you want that you consider just getting that crew cut your relatives pester you about.    I tried some pomades that helped a little but seemed either too greasy or not affective, not to mention expensive. This however is cheap and affective, but it is greasy and the smell might make you question putting it in your hair at first.    The grease, isn&#x27;t a negative at all for me. I thoroughly rub a quarter sized glob into my hair after straightening it, put on a beanie, then go to sleep. Wake up and the hair I&#x27;m assuming absorbs it all because its soft, no longer heavy, not greasy AT ALL, wont frizz, and allows easy movement. But also it now smells more like a very pleasant skin lotion, and it actually smells quite good in my hair on a hot day I find myself sweating.    I think if it wasn&#x27;t for this I&#x27;d have gotten that crew cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was a little girl.  It still smells great.  The grease is not heavy on my hair.  It give my hair a glossy look to it.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> From reading all the reviews, I thought this product would work really well. I was very disappointed. I put a little in after washing my hair and I let it dry. It made my hair disgusting. It felt greasy, tangled, unmanageable, and my hair was dull looking. I have long wavy/curly hair, and I have to put mousse and some kind of product in it after washing so it doesn&#x27;t dry frizzy, and I thought that this would help make my hair healthy looking, manageable, and soft as advertized, but it had the complete opposite effect. I&#x27;m never putting this stuff in my hair again. Maybe I&#x27;ll save it to prank somebody, because that&#x27;s all I can think of to do with it. Or maybe I can try putting it in BEFORE I wash my hair, because it looks terrible if left in. I assumed it didn&#x27;t need to be washed out because all the other reviews said they left it in.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product. And I thought I&#x27;d need a good hair product. So I tryed it and really really works. So if are thinking of buying some it is not a waste of money because it works.</li>
    <li> Really Greasy, Weird smell</li>
    <li> Our Pro-Line-Hair Food purchase price was very good, and when we received it in a very short time. We were very please with everything.</li>
    <li> I have blond hair that is very curly and gets brittle when it&#x27;s long. It is still soft but looks unhealthy and frizzy. I&#x27;ve been using Hair Food since I got it and it makes my hair look and feel so much healthier. I apply it and it does take a few hours to stop looking greasy but then looks fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have fairly short hair, but I am always having to deal with my stubborn, bushy hair.  When I dry it, my hair poofs everywhere.  I have used gel for years.  It makes your hair stiff and crusty.  Regular gel oozes and messes up my skin when I sweat.  I just received this product like 4 days ago, and I am never going back to gel.  Just put a little bit on your hand and work it through your hair.  It makes your hair shinier and holds it in place without stiffening it.  The cool thing about it is that it is actually like a hair treatment.  After washing my hair thoroughly, I notice that my hair is much more tame and silky.  Really, I don&#x27;t even need to put anything in it after washing, because the effects last forever.  It brings out all of the colors.  I think its genius.  You have to try this!  Oh, and when I sweat, there is no oozing at all.  It all feels so natural.</li>
    <li> Proline has been used by my family since its exsistance.  I use to purchase this product locally at the price of $3.79.  Why is the price $10.00 for the same size Hair Food jar.  I like the product but hope the price can be lowered.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this bottle is $10.00.  This is a very small bottle!  I came on this sight to purchase this grease ,because I have purchased this before from here.  I didn&#x27;t spend $10.00 when I purchased this in the past.  I guess I will check my local stores to see if they sell it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using it daily for the last 20 years.  It suits for my hair. That is why I love it over the other similar products.</li>
    <li> I love &#x27;Hair Food&#x27;. I&#x27;m of mixed race and my hair is crazy curly. It makes my hair feel good if it&#x27;s frizzy and it has a wonderful smell to it. It&#x27;s good to put on right after I&#x27;ve washed my hair. But I wouldn&#x27;t add to much if I were you. Adding a little to your hair is just fine.</li>
    <li> its really really good, like really, really good. buy it because its very very very very good, like seriously. really very good</li>
    <li> this is the best hair oil i have ever used. it is very light,smells good and is affordable. unfortunately i have not been able to find any lately.it seems that this item has been discontinued. Looking for help ordering this product online.</li>
    <li> Will you be getting more in???? I cannot find this anywhere online. If anyone has a connect please tell me. This is the only thing that works on my hair!! **Panic mode**</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair foods out there. Can&#x27;t find it anymore in the USA.</li>
    <li> Have used this product sense I was 17 years old and in the Army.  My hair is thick and when cut short would stand on end.  HAIR FOOD helped train my hair down.  I&#x27;m now 51 years old and I swear my hair is the same it was when 17.  Just can&#x27;t say the same for the rest of me.  LoL</li>
    <li> WOW! Fast delivery and product looked as advertised. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product and I Like the texture of it. Hard to find at times put very good. I will purchase more</li>
    <li> I have used Pro-Line Hair Food for many, many years and it is the best for me. It is light, gives my hair a sheen and require only small amounts.</li>
    <li> I must say the only reason I knew about this product was through Shane Dawson on Youtube. And if you don&#x27;t know who that is, then you should go check him out. I followed his video on how to use this product, and I must say it made my hair silky, and shiny as ever. I applied a quarter-size amount right before going to bed to straight flat-ironed hair. I worked it in, and then combed it downward. After doing all those steps, I went to bed with a beanie on. After waking up in the morning the product really improved the look, as long as the texture of my hair. This product didn&#x27;t give out any scent when on the hair in the morning, or night so that&#x27;s nothing to think bad of. Even if your hair is fried, this little guy can make it look healthy as ever. For the price, and the free shipping this stuff is worth it! Also this is longer lasting than even BED HEAD After Party, which is a $20 dollar hair cream. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it, and will continue to use/purchase it! I give it a 4/5 because nothing is perfect, but this is very good!</li>
    <li> Hard to rate a product whose only instruction is not to press hair with it on.  Nothing about how much to apply (dried all glistening greasy the first time and had to re-shampoo and reapply teeny bit - still no good.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels in my hair.  It&#x27;s good for my young son&#x27;s hair too.</li>
    <li> My  husband only used this and it is not in the store anymore  but price is too high</li>
