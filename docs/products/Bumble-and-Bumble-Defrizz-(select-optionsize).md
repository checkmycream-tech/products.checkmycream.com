      <li>I really like the  good rating of the product in terms of the chemicals, if your into that stuff.</li>
      <li>I have super fine fly away hair and this product really helps.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair smooth</li>
      <li>This stuff is fabulous.</li>
      <li>The rain, my hair stays frizz free.</li>
      <li>Is a great tool for frizz especially living at the coast in 80%+ humidity.</li>
      <li>Bumble and Bumble has discontinued this fragrance free product.</li>
      <li>Very, very worth the money.</li>
      <li>This is a good light product for your hair, I have been using it for a while and find it to be a good product for my thick hair.</li>
      <li>Not bad, but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
      <li>This product provides a weightless feel and my hair is super silky.  </li>
      <li>but this helps tremendously.</li>
      <li>I have dry hair that frizzes a good bit.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s actually worthy of a good rating, but certainly not the defrizz product.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and my hair frizzes very easily most of the time, but especially when it&#x27;s humid.</li>
      <li>well worth it</li>
      <li>So far, I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This is just as good as every other silicon-based hair product from Biosilk, Aveda, Paul Mitchell, or even Pantene and Paul Frieda.  </li>
      <li>My wife loves this product and the price is right on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Right combo</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t have to use very much AT ALL.</li>
      <li>I have lots of naturally curly fine hair which tends to get out of hand in the summer.  </li>
      <li>and I have tried nearly every product available to make sleek, silky curls.  </li>
      <li>this one definitely controls frizzy hair much better.  </li>
      <li>Tried many different products but nothing worked as well as this one.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!  </li>
      <li>First let me say that I&#x27;m a Bumble and Bumble fan.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I have tried MANY such products and this is the only one that consistently and effectively helps battle the frizz that afflicts my naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>With a flat iron I look like a star :)</li>
      <li>Generally I have fine hair (but a lot of it)</li>
      <li>It tames the frizzies fly aways for the days where I want curl and smooths it to silky smooth straight hair for days when I blow dry with a round brush or straighten with a straightener.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to re-create that hair day, but this stuff works ok as long as it&#x27;s not too humid.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve liked it but for some odd reason I never wanted to buy it until they stopped carrying it.</li>
      <li>I believe in the BB products I use but silicone serums are available at all price points and they are all almost exactly the same thing.  </li>
      <li>BB DeFrizz works well, especially if you use a lot of it if your hair is colored/permed/etc. and frizzes easily.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve not found anything that works as well in the very humid climate of Washington, DC.</li>
      <li>It could be olive oil for all I know, because it really hasn&#x27;t made a difference.     </li>
      <li>: both serums are composed entirely of silicone, which is cheap.  </li>
      <li>I guess for the price I expected something better. . .</li>
      <li>I use this every day, whether I&#x27;m doing my hair curly or straight.  </li>
      <li>It helps to calm my naturally wavy (</li>
      <li>I used to have straight hair until the gray started coming in.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t understand why there&#x27;s so much hype about this product.</li>
      <li>It really controls frizz, a dime size goes along way</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair, which can get very frizzy with humidity, and DeFRIZZ works like a charm.  </li>
      <li>It works and it is incredibly reasonable.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, frizz free, my color has stayed true and I have noticably less split ends.</li>
      <li>I did not find this product to help more than the average product.</li>
      <li>I live in NY where it gets really humid, but when I use this product my hair stays frizz-free.</li>
      <li>As I get older the crown section of my hair gets drier, coarser and frizzier.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have dry hair that frizzes a good bit.  I put enough on that it makes my hair look greasy, but after hitting it with the hairdryer briefly, the greasy look disappears and the product works as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  BB DeFrizz works well, especially if you use a lot of it if your hair is colored/permed/etc. and frizzes easily. The SUGGESTED amount doesn&#x27;t work well under those conditions.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle of De-Frizz in the mail, and when I went to open it I realized why the envelope was all wet. The tape covering the lid to the bottle came undone and 3/4 of the bottle was all over the wrapping and packaging. I immediately threw the wrapper away (and of course it was garbage day this morning) and when I wrote the company they want a picture of proof for a small 4 oz bottle. I just finished chemo and my hair has grown back frizzy, so this is new for me... So I thought I would give this stuff a try. I have much more going on than to take pictures of greasy packages to send to them. Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> i have the crazy curly hair and am always looking for the magic potion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; this comes close,  the day you wear it it works really nicely for curls....but the next day my hair feels stiff and kind of greasy....  those of you that have the  curly, curly hair know that our hair tends to be on the dry side, so it&#x27;s hard to wash it everyday-- and not make it worse......  anyway, if you know that going in-- it&#x27;s a great product!  you don&#x27;t have to use very much AT ALL.</li>
    <li> A little expensive but it works. I really like the  good rating of the product in terms of the chemicals, if your into that stuff.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product. I live in NY where it gets really humid, but when I use this product my hair stays frizz-free. From the time I smoothed it in till I washed it out again it truly transformed my hair to something sleek, shiny and manageable. I never thought I could say that about my hair. Remarkable stuff.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and curly hair and I have tried nearly every product available to make sleek, silky curls.  This is just as good as every other silicon-based hair product from Biosilk, Aveda, Paul Mitchell, or even Pantene and Paul Frieda.  Sigh.  I need some sort of miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Well, I really was excited to receive this item because I&#x27;ve always heard great things about the Bumble and Bumble line of hair products. But I was quite disappointed when I used it. Instead of defrizzing my hair, it somehow made my hair more frizzy than ever and there was certainly no shine to be seen through all that frizz. I have fine hair and my hair frizzes very easily most of the time, but especially when it&#x27;s humid. I&#x27;d think a defrizz product would do the defrizzing like it says. I can&#x27;t see why my hair type should matter. But I tried it several times during humid and non-humid days and my hair still didn&#x27;t smoothen for me...frizzed away... So I can&#x27;t recommend it...I can&#x27;t understand why there&#x27;s so much hype about this product. Maybe it&#x27;s their shampoo/conditioner line that&#x27;s actually worthy of a good rating, but certainly not the defrizz product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better products I&#x27;ve used to reduce frizzy hair.  My stylist recommended it over Aveda.  I like both products but this one definitely controls frizzy hair much better.  My hair also feels very soft when I use it.</li>
    <li> i have tried everything for curly frizzy hair and this is one of the best products i have ever used.  i have been using it for about 10 yrs.  i use about a dime size for my shoulder length hair as soon as i get out of the shower.  i notice a big difference on days that i do not use it.  i highly recommend this product to anyone with curly frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble curls deFRIZZ is an excellent product overall.  It helps to calm my naturally wavy (and, at times, crazy...) hair without weighing it down.  It isn&#x27;t as sticky as some other de-frizz serums and lets me go out in humid weather without the worry that my hair will become a hairball.</li>
    <li> Even I. The rain, my hair stays frizz free.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes my hair would look a little bit more &#x27;finished&#x27; after straightening, curling, etc. However, every time I use it, I keep looking at the mirror wondering if it actually DID anything. And it&#x27;s frustrating that I spent more than 20.00 on a small bottle of a product that I really have to wonder is actually doing anything. It could be olive oil for all I know, because it really hasn&#x27;t made a difference.     Would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every anti-frizz product in the world.  Last time I got my hair cut, the hair dresser used this stuff and I had the best hair day of my life, so I immediately bought some.  I have yet to re-create that hair day, but this stuff works ok as long as it&#x27;s not too humid.  Also kind of leaves my hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Finally, a product that leaves my hair perfectly silky smooth without any greasy side effects.  A small dab will do for shoulder length hair.  It tames the frizzies fly aways for the days where I want curl and smooths it to silky smooth straight hair for days when I blow dry with a round brush or straighten with a straightener.  Perfect product.  Very, very worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product! Esp. for African American women w/o a perm.....  It won&#x27;t help when you get caught in the rain or in humid weather but it does help if you apply before you blow dry.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and the price is right on Amazon.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  My long hair was getting a &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; feeling to it.  I read an article which claimed to get rid of the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; feeling with this product.  Voila! It works!  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have searched and searched for years for a product that will help my hair in humid weather.  I have lots of naturally curly fine hair which tends to get out of hand in the summer.  I use this every day, whether I&#x27;m doing my hair curly or straight.  it&#x27;s just so great, I notice a huge difference and would never use anything else unless they take it off the market!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but felt compelled. I have very coarse thick naturally curly hair. Nothing has ever helped to truly control frizz in humid weather. Tonight, in Florida, it is damp and I stood in sprinkles for over an hour-no frizz. Love it! I applid before I blow dried, once during, and again after. My hair is so soft and never looks oily. Works wonders!</li>
    <li> Use with a blow dryer on wet hair.</li>
    <li> I did not find this product to help more than the average product. It seemed to work for a bit then when it dried my hair was frizzy again. Not bad, but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I am 55 and have been coloring my hair for 40+ years. I used to have straight hair until the gray started coming in. After I shampoo and blow dry my hair it frizzes, and living in the southeast with the humidity, I need all the help I can get. I have tried all kinds of defrizzers but this is the best of the best of the best!! It is pricey, but well worth it - a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This was amazing. I use B&amp;Bs styling cream but humid weather makes my hair frizz up like I&#x27;ve been electrocuted! It&#x27;s completely out of control. Generally I have fine hair (but a lot of it) and it is straight if I blow dry except for curlies around my face or curly/wavy if it air dries. This product finally got rid of those ridiculous curlies around my face that stick out in all directions. In the humidity - cruise/beach my hair is generally a mess because of the frizz but this helps tremendously. A little goes a long way.... I use it on damp or dry hair and it tames the wild and stray hairs. It can be mixed with styling cream and does wonderfully as a combo. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product works well with my hair texture.  I have been unable to find it at my local cosmetic store.</li>
    <li> I use a dab (less than the size of a dime) before blow-drying and flat-ironing.  A dab goes a long way on my thick, otherwise wavy, medium-length hair.  I bought a bottle about a year ago and it&#x27;s not even 1/2 through.  It cuts down flat-ironing time (and damage).  Keeps my hair smooth and I don&#x27;t need another product after.  My &#x27;do still goes kinda crazy with the humidity but not as disastrous if without.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  I have tried MANY such products and this is the only one that consistently and effectively helps battle the frizz that afflicts my naturally curly hair.  I have used it for several years now and I&#x27;ve not found anything that works as well in the very humid climate of Washington, DC.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous. It makes your hair thick, glossy, and fuller than any other product I have used. With a flat iron I look like a star :)</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd bottle I have bought after a friend gave me hers over 8 years ago. Each time I have to buy it again, I hesitate because it is expensive! Then I realize 1 bottle lasts me 2 years. It works and it is incredibly reasonable. You just need a little. It&#x27;s a great lubricant too. I have medium length thin mostly straight hair.</li>
    <li> I use a tiny amount every day. Love this stuff. I have super fine fly away hair and this product really helps. On curly days I use with their curl cream. On straight days I use with other stuff</li>
    <li> Is a great tool for frizz especially living at the coast in 80%+ humidity. Does not leave your hair greasy</li>
    <li> This is a good light product for your hair, I have been using it for a while and find it to be a good product for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best frizz control product I have ever purchased! Great even in really humid conditions. I would definitely recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I have the most difficult frizzy hair and I have tried EVERYTHING to tame the frizz. As I get older the crown section of my hair gets drier, coarser and frizzier. This product is the only one that comes close to smoothing the frizz. You need only a small amount as it is heavy and easy to over do, but if you have thick hair that&#x27;s very resistant to other defrizzing products, this one is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! This works great on my curly hair to add moisture without looking oily. It adds shine as a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works so well in smoothing my sometimes out of control hair:) quick shipping and great product!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products of its type for someone with fine hair.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and you only need a pea size amount. This bottle lasts me for months.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair very soft and silky.  I love the way my hair feels after I use it.  As far as reducing frizz goes, I do have to admit, I have had other products work better.  Moroccan Oil or Pureology Serum have worked a little better for me, but those products also leave my hair feeling greasy or heavy.  This product provides a weightless feel and my hair is super silky.  I love mixing it in with my leave-in conditioner.  I am probably going to purchase this product again, just because I love the way it makes my hair feel and it does reduce frizz.</li>
    <li> Great Product for defrizzing your hair...it does what it promises. Since you only need a small drop of it this product will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thru Amazon because there are no local salons that carry this brand. My hairdresser has used this product on me before and I&#x27;ve liked it but for some odd reason I never wanted to buy it until they stopped carrying it. It really controls frizz, a dime size goes along way and I mix it in my palm with one pump of Redken Heat Glide to protect from the heat of styling tools. Too much of either product will make hair greasy and a little limp. Right combo and it&#x27;s a perfect hair cocktail! My hair is shiny, frizz free, my color has stayed true and I have noticably less split ends. I recommend it when used alone but I HIGHLY recommend it mixed with 1 pump of Redken Heat Glide.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years now and can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for defrizzing your hair and not oily.. I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
    <li> My hair is out of control in winter. Tried many different products but nothing worked as well as this one. A small amount smoothes out my hair immediately, also leaves a shine. My hair looks healthier and easier to style.</li>
    <li> Product appeared clumpy.</li>
    <li> Not happy, not worth the money, made my hair look like an oil slick.  Helped frizz a little but way too oily, not happy for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> The best , the best. Waist long, thick hair and it works everytime!My hair looks shiny, soft and zero frizz when I blow out with this product.</li>
    <li> The DeFRIZZ serum works great on my medium fine hair to keep it from being frizzy in any situation. I always use a little while my hair is damp before I style it and then a little after I style it maybe half way through the day to keep the frizz away. A little goes a long way and the 4 oz bottle last me years usually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like this product because it&#x27;s not oil based, so it keeps my hair soft, not sticky or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for anyone who needs to tame their frizz but doesn&#x27;t like to use heavy amounts of styling products.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I&#x27;m a Bumble and Bumble fan.  There are two BB products that are holy grail products for me: Invisible Oil Primer and Does It All styling spray.  But I&#x27;m not a fan of DeFrizz.  There is a similar product, Got2b Shine Serum, that works just as well and costs $5 at the drugstore.  It&#x27;s all silicone and works really well to control frizz when used on clean wet hair before styling products.  It can even be used very sparingly on dry hair to control flyaways and add shine.  BB DeFrizz has essentially the same ingredients and is expensive because you&#x27;re basically paying for the name.  Got2b comes in a bigger size for a very low price and it works really well, so I&#x27;d be a fool to pay through the nose for the BB product.  I believe in the BB products I use but silicone serums are available at all price points and they are all almost exactly the same thing.  I put a few drops of Got2b into my palms and then rub my hands together and distribute the product throughout my hair, avoiding the scalp area.  It works like a charm to control frizz even in the Florida heat and humidity.  There is absolutely no reason to purchase BB DeFrizz.  They work exactly the same.  I&#x27;m giving BB DeFrizz two stars because of the inflated price.  However, the two BB products I can&#x27;t live without deserve five stars (I&#x27;ve already reviewed them).  So BB and I differ on this point: both serums are composed entirely of silicone, which is cheap.  So why pay more?  Save your cash and get Got2b Shine Serum instead.  That is unless you&#x27;re hell bent on having a BB bottle on your bathroom counter, lol!</li>
    <li> I guess for the price I expected something better. . . I will stick with my usual after this is gone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I am happy that I have eliminated most frizzy days. I would recommend this product. Bonus this product does not have any noticeable scent which is great for people with sensitivity to perfumes</li>
    <li> I combine this product with the bumble and bumble straight blow dry and it makes a great cocktail to help fight the frizz while blowdrying my thick frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> So far, I love this product.  It appears to keep the frizz down without causing hair to weigh down like it is dirty.  I use this product after my shower, before I start blow-drying.  Sometimes I use it after blow-drying as well when needed.  You only need to use a tiny amount.  I bought the 4 oz bottle, and I can see this lasting me 6-months or longer.  A coworker who has hair a lot like mine (naturally curly and frizzy) recommended it to me.  Great product, I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this hair serum. It never leaves my hair feeling or looking greasy!  I use it on damp and dry hair to the care of any frizz!  I have been using for years!</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair, which can get very frizzy with humidity, and DeFRIZZ works like a charm.  I only need a small drop of it, about the size of a dime, and my hair is soft and frizz free until the next washing.</li>
    <li> best product for frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble has discontinued this fragrance free product. That is too bad, since I cannot handle fragrance. This has just 2 ingredients Dimethiconol and cyclomethicone (cyclopentasiloxane). Search here at amazon.com for Cyclo-Dimethicone, it&#x27;s the same thing as this defrizz product. It&#x27;s also less expensive. Yay!</li>
