### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is one of my best perfumes.</li>
      <li>Like any cologne, it will depend upon how it mixes with your skin chemistry, but for me it is apparently a perfect match.</li>
      <li>make it an ideal</li>
      <li>its great value in price</li>
      <li>It smells like a soap scented with sage and cloves, and it has a great tart, woody drydown with the vetiver and tobacco in the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very effective if worn on body rather then attire.</li>
      <li>smells wonderful will buy more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the office since it has more of a &amp;#34;soapy and well-groomed&amp;#34; scent.  </li>
      <li>Good for daytime.</li>
      <li>so I thought this would be a great one to get since they discontinued my favorite L&#x27;Homme.  </li>
      <li>nice and good quality</li>
      <li>I dont know what to make of this, it&#x27;s nice and smells &amp;#34;familiar&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Women come in to my office and tell me they love coming in because it always smells so good.  </li>
      <li>I have always liked this one.</li>
      <li>I use it under my t-shirts as to not overpower myself with my own fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is very strong and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Sillage is very strong.</li>
      <li>A fine product, very attracting smell, every one will like without any doubt and best for the price.</li>
      <li>I used to wear &amp;#34;L&#x27;Homme&amp;#34; by Roger and Gallet but many of the department stores that used to carry it either no longer do or have gone out of business</li>
      <li>I recommended it for the day more than night</li>
      <li>I had read another review which said this smells like L&#x27;Homme Essentiel - one of my favorite scents -- and I love Roger &amp; Gallet</li>
      <li>and i love the fragrance</li>
      <li>Have been using it for many years.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this scent.</li>
      <li>I LOVE</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Bought from AAAperfume and will buy 2 more.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s my loss, it smelled like cheap cologne/</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s got great sillage and longevity (12+ hours), I don&#x27;t find Open very powerful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very clean and fresh, like just from a shower.</li>
      <li>Mighty powerful scent!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best perfume out there, I love it and have used it regularly for 24 years, with girls drooling over the mild, aromatic, sensuous aroma.</li>
      <li>I mean strong and very pleasant.</li>
      <li>It kind of resembles soap and powder, definitely get some spice and a tad of patchouli.</li>
      <li>The best smell, fresh and young, intense and with long and profound durability.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for the Vetiver to be more obvious</li>
      <li>#34;What IS that?&amp;#34;  The selfish part of me is kind of happy that you can&#x27;t find it in stores because it means I&#x27;m almost always the only person wearing it.  </li>
      <li>I recommend It to any man that wants a discreet cologne with lots of class.</li>
      <li>Very manly fragrance.</li>
      <li>Very 80&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re interested in trying this, get ready for a super DRY scent!</li>
      <li>Classic scent.</li>
      <li>I needed a classic cologne for work at this is it.  </li>
      <li>right up next to my neck, &amp;</li>
      <li>Inevitably, I&#x27;ll get on an elevator and some woman will notie it right away and ask what it is so she can get some from her husband.  </li>
      <li>Definitely not the right one.</li>
      <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the strong scent but for me the smell and the long lasting combination</li>
      <li>this is pretty similar.  </li>
      <li>If you want to smell like an old, very old lady buy this one, you&#x27;ll be a hit at the mortuary.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Open&amp;#34; is very close in scent and is very different from the others.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;re a fan of stuff like Equipage or Jacomo de Jacomo, you&#x27;ll probably really like Open.</li>
      <li>Open never fails to get a compliment from some woman who gets close enough to get a whiff.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, herbal and very transparent, not rich or heavy at all.</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would smell like L&#x27;Homme Essential (which is lush) -</li>
      <li>This is a strong cologne, but not overwhelming, and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>But another part of me wants other guys to have the same experience.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find the product on Amazon.com since it has been quite difficult to find it in stores lately.  </li>

<li> Sorry to say</li>
<li> But WOAH - sadly this smells like a boy who made a terrible olfactory decision in a drug store in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
<li> This is one of the worst scents I have ever smelled, It made me sick, even now writing this my stomach turns just thinking about it, it was horrible!!!</li>
<li> Worst fragance ever...save your money!</li>
<li> but this smells awful - if you remember awful HS drugstore cologne</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using Open by Roger et Gallet for at least 25 years and I keep getting compliments regularly. I was so happy to find the product on Amazon.com since it has been quite difficult to find it in stores lately.  The scent is not overwhelming and lasts all  day. I recommend It to any man that wants a discreet cologne with lots of class.</li>
    <li> I like the perfume smell, and use the perfume since 1990&#x27;s, the onl;y problem is hard to get in Asia region</li>
    <li> I had this may be 20 years ago and scent just same. Made in France in sealed box. Bought from AAAperfume and will buy 2 more.</li>
    <li> I purchased Open because I heard it was similar to the smell of Dial Gold Soap.   It is the closest thing I&#x27;ve ever found to Dial Gold. For the price, anyone that enjoys the scent of Dial Gold would do well with this in their wardrobe. It will last a lifetime and I wear it around the house often.</li>
    <li> The best smell, fresh and young, intense and with long and profound durability. I recommended it for the day more than night</li>
    <li> I had read another review which said this smells like L&#x27;Homme Essentiel - one of my favorite scents -- and I love Roger &amp; Gallet so I thought this would be a great one to get since they discontinued my favorite L&#x27;Homme.  But WOAH - sadly this smells like a boy who made a terrible olfactory decision in a drug store in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re interested in trying this, get ready for a super DRY scent! Look at the notes: sage, thyme, vetiver, lemon, lavender. Wearing this could dehydrate you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s got great sillage and longevity (12+ hours), I don&#x27;t find Open very powerful. It&#x27;s light, herbal and very transparent, not rich or heavy at all. It smells like a soap scented with sage and cloves, and it has a great tart, woody drydown with the vetiver and tobacco in the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a fan of stuff like Equipage or Jacomo de Jacomo, you&#x27;ll probably really like Open. I love it.</li>
    <li> I used to wear &amp;#34;L&#x27;Homme&amp;#34; by Roger and Gallet but many of the department stores that used to carry it either no longer do or have gone out of business so it is harder to get.  &amp;#34;Open&amp;#34; is very close in scent and is very different from the others.

    <li> Very manly fragrance. I mean strong and very pleasant. Fragrance stays longer.Very effective if worn on body rather then attire.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this one. The spicy fragnance is just a kill for the price.</li>
    <li> Open never fails to get a compliment from some woman who gets close enough to get a whiff.  And it isn&#x27;t just, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s nice.&amp;#34;  It is almost always, after a second sniff right up next to my neck, &amp;#34;What IS that?&amp;#34;  The selfish part of me is kind of happy that you can&#x27;t find it in stores because it means I&#x27;m almost always the only person wearing it.  But another part of me wants other guys to have the same experience.  Like any cologne, it will depend upon how it mixes with your skin chemistry, but for me it is apparently a perfect match.</li>

    <li> A fine product, very attracting smell, every one will like without any doubt and best for the price.</li>
    <li> save the money for something else</li>
    <li> A guy at work wears this cologne. He said he dabs it on the inside of his wrists. I absolutely LOVE this scent. It&#x27;s very clean and fresh, like just from a shower. This is a strong cologne, but not overwhelming, and lasts a long time. Good for daytime. Don&#x27;t overdo it. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for many years. Classic scent.</li>
    <li> I dont know what to make of this, it&#x27;s nice and smells &amp;#34;familiar&amp;#34;. It kind of resembles soap and powder, definitely get some spice and a tad of patchouli. I use it but doesnt seems to lighten up quite a bit.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful will buy more</li>
    <li> Mighty powerful scent! Sillage is very strong. Very 80&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> its great value in price and i love the fragrance</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like an old, very old lady buy this one, you&#x27;ll be a hit at the mortuary. This is one of the worst scents I have ever smelled, It made me sick, even now writing this my stomach turns just thinking about it, it was horrible!!! I&#x27;ll be careful next time and will never buy any of these people&#x27;s fragrances, NEVER!!!!</li>
    <li> Worst fragance ever...save your money!</li>
    <li> nice and good quality</li>
    <li> I was hoping this scent by Roger Galet was the one I was looking for that a friend had. Definitely not the right one. Sorry to say and it&#x27;s my loss, it smelled like cheap cologne/</li>
    <li> This is one of my best perfumes. It is very strong and lasts all day. Some people don&#x27;t like the strong scent but for me the smell and the long lasting combination make it an ideal one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear it to work on a daily basis.</li>

I was hoping for the Vetiver to be more obvious but I think it gets a little lost in the blend.  Still, its a tasteful cologne especially for the price.</li>
    <li> An awful cheap, synthetic, overwhelming scent.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off and toss the bottle.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t want to hate it - I LOVE roger&amp;gallet but this smells awful - if you remember awful HS drugstore cologne this is pretty similar.  I was hoping it would smell like L&#x27;Homme Essential (which is lush) - but it&#x27;s not even close</li>
