      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with if I have no complaints.</li>
      <li>I now own three of these mirrors for my home, condo and beach house.</li>
      <li>The rest is made of plastic which for the most part works well.  </li>
      <li>what more could I ask for.</li>
      <li>For the cost of this item, it should be made out of something more durable than plastic.</li>
      <li>I bought this for $45 after research as well so don&#x27;t don&#x27;t spend more than 60 bucks</li>
      <li>Love shaving in the shower.</li>
      <li>The fitting on the mirror which is inserted between the nipple on the wall and the shower head is made of plastic.</li>
      <li>More water was coming out of the mirror than the spout once installed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had plastic mirrors before the Sharper Image model and they were ok functioning, but kndd of looked cheap.</li>
      <li>From all the other products out there for this puropse I think this one is the best</li>
      <li>This allowed easy installation and use.</li>
      <li>It works fine for Shaving.</li>
      <li>The mirror (head) swivel also works fine.</li>
      <li>I may have been fine with the price if it would have work.  </li>
      <li>I was pleased with the quick delivery and the quality of the mirror and attachments.</li>
      <li>I would have been ok with this product, but it is made of plastic and not metal, for the price about four times what it is worth.  </li>

      <li>it is totally fogless and the magnified mirror is great for those of us that need readers.  </li>
      <li>Oh, and putting it on, I had to wrap Teflon tape like 20 times just to get the cheap plastic connector to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you take your time and not apply to much force when installing, I think it will be ok.  </li>
      <li>These issues I can live with because I was able to fix them.  </li>
      <li>Can only be mounted straight door underneath shower head, not off to side at usable height because its made of cheap plastic that strips out under its own weight.</li>
      <li>I thought this one would be a good one for the $85.00 we spent.  </li>
      <li>In fact, it was better than our old one from Restoration Hardware.</li>
      <li>so I can shave, but every time I get it just right</li>
      <li>It has teeth and locks right in.</li>
      <li>Its main flaw is the plastic cheap piece that screws to your pipe.  </li>
      <li>The mirror pivots and rotates from front to back for magnification very easily and is quite functional.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to replace my Sharper Image deluxe all metal shower mirror that finally sprung a leak after 12 years.</li>
      <li>product leaked out of the bottom, anti fog did not work on the top of the unit, all plastic seems very fragile</li>
      <li>This was exactly what we wanted/needed.  </li>
      <li>(I did on my first one).</li>
      <li>I finally took it off and went back to the old school fogless mirror without the warm water bath to keep it fog free.</li>
      <li>The unit I received had apparently been returned by someone else because the fitting was completely cracked and incapable of making a water-tight seal.</li>
      <li>actually becomes fogged---this is not a big issue since the mirror is quite large and the lower part of the mirror is more than adequate surface for shaving.</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t believe i paid this much.  </li>
      <li>I found with the same features, Fog free with 3x magnifier.</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery&#x3D;</li>
      <li>They really stay fogless and are no fuss in teh shower stall.</li>
      <li>I got this mirror for christmas and it is absolutely garbage.</li>
      <li>and no one is sending me a new one...</li>
      <li>The shut off valve was deep enough to tighten the treads into and then the shower head easily fit onto the shut off valve.  </li>
      <li>THis is the second mirror of this type we have had - the first lasted over 7 years.  </li>
      <li>The mirror itself almost instantly fogged up because so much hot steaming water was coming out of the mirror.  </li>
      <li>It was more costly than any of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
      <li>The other reviews about the threads not working and leading are true as well.  </li>
      <li>I have my doughts that you&#x27;ll be able to change shower heads to many times, but I did install it, its working, so I can&#x27;t give it any bad marks.  </li>
      <li>I returned the piece of junk as it was clearly DOA.</li>
      <li>If anyone knows how to get the leakage fixed then it would be a 5 star product.  </li>
      <li>When our old shower mirror sprung a leak, we didn&#x27;t think we could find another.  </li>
      <li>Another issue I fixed was the angle of the mirror.  </li>
      <li>Just a shower head washer from the hardware store or an old showerhead</li>
      <li>The only downside is that the way it is designed, the water flow through the backside of the mirror to maintain the fog free surface---it does not fully fill all of the cavities back there and thus a part of the upper side of the mirror</li>
      <li>I have no issues so far with this product.  </li>
      <li>This issue is easily fixed by adjusting the telescopic arm to the correct height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>This fogless mirror promises the same quality of the similar priced Sharper Image fogless mirror, which I should have gone with in the first play, but I like the adjustable arm idea.  </li>
      <li>Sharper image apparently doesn&#x27;t care about their image anymore.</li>
      <li>cause I almost bought a $100 one, def not worth that much!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The mirror is constructed well but the arm will not stay in place no matter how tight you get it.  therefore it is not being used.  Need arm that will bend etc.</li>
    <li> To all,    I would never use this product again, water circulates around it and drains out, I was not informed of this before buying. I wanted one that circulates and back into plumbing ( ike the one I had before this one). This does not do that. I have had it now for a little over three months and now it is starting to fog over. Not Good.    Larry</li>
    <li> Great product!  Bought it for my boyfriend and no more hairs in or around the sink!  But it leaks even after buying stuff to help decrease leakage.  From all the other products out there for this puropse I think this one is the best, I did my research before I bought it and asked around.  If anyone knows how to get the leakage fixed then it would be a 5 star product.  I bought this for $45 after research as well so don&#x27;t don&#x27;t spend more than 60 bucks cause I almost bought a $100 one, def not worth that much!  Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> I ordered tthis because I had to replace one that I use for over 15 years. It is of excellent quality it works perfect. I don&#x27;t have any problem with the mirror fogging.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the negative comments were made by other people that supposedly ordered this product. I&#x27;m very pleased with if I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the mirror, however it does leak out of the bottom.  For the cost of this item, it should be made out of something more durable than plastic.</li>
    <li> I have no issues so far with this product.  I like the 3x and 1x mirrors.  I read others reviews before I bought it and had a good idea of the quality this mirror is.  Its main flaw is the plastic cheap piece that screws to your pipe.  If you take your time and not apply to much force when installing, I think it will be ok.  I have my doughts that you&#x27;ll be able to change shower heads to many times, but I did install it, its working, so I can&#x27;t give it any bad marks.  Love shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> Can only be mounted straight door underneath shower head, not off to side at usable height because its made of cheap plastic that strips out under its own weight. Way over priced. This is dollar store junk. Sharper image apparently doesn&#x27;t care about their image anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shower mirror for my husband. We received the mirror at the end of July 2013. This is his comments:  I haven&#x27;t even used it 2 months &amp; it is not holding up. Appears to be cheaply made. The \\&quot;extending arm\\&quot; is not strong enough to hold the mirror in position. It just falls down below the shower head, about my chest level &amp; is useless.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to keep it positioned in place so I can shave, but every time I get it just right, it slips down again.  Now it is fogging up &amp; I can&#x27;t see to shave.  I want a refund.  I have used a shower mirror for over 15 years.  I thought this one would be a good one for the $85.00 we spent.  It was more costly than any of the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Very unhappy customer here.&lt;br /&gt;D. Brooks&lt;br /&gt;Houston, TX</li>
    <li> When our old shower mirror sprung a leak, we didn&#x27;t think we could find another.  This was exactly what we wanted/needed.  In fact, it was better than our old one from Restoration Hardware.</li>
    <li> product leaked out of the bottom, anti fog did not work on the top of the unit, all plastic seems very fragile</li>
    <li> Item is poorly manufactured. The fitting on the mirror which is inserted between the nipple on the wall and the shower head is made of plastic. The unit I received had apparently been returned by someone else because the fitting was completely cracked and incapable of making a water-tight seal. I returned the piece of junk as it was clearly DOA.</li>
    <li> Great Price&#x3D;Great Product&#x3D;Fast Delivery&#x3D;Thank You</li>
    <li> Some reviews state the parts are plastic, but there are some parts made of metal.  The telescopic adjustable arm is made of metal, and the razor holder is metal.  The rest is made of plastic which for the most part works well.  The other reviews about the threads not working and leading are true as well.  These issues I can live with because I was able to fix them.  For the leaky threads I used a lot of thread tape and a rubber washer to connect it to the shower pipe.  For the threads at the exit end where you connect the shower head, I used a shut off valve.  The shut off valve was deep enough to tighten the treads into and then the shower head easily fit onto the shut off valve.  Another issue I fixed was the angle of the mirror.  Over time the mirror will hang straight down making it hard to see in.  This issue is easily fixed by adjusting the telescopic arm to the correct height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it is a great design and does not fog.  The issues are minor and can be fix by a handyman.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  It&#x27;s a replacement for a similar product I bought from Sharper Image 20 years ago!  I have a good feeling this will last me another 20 years!</li>
    <li> THis is the second mirror of this type we have had - the first lasted over 7 years.  My husband loves them! They really stay fogless and are no fuss in teh shower stall.</li>
    <li> I got this mirror for christmas and it is absolutely garbage. As others have noted, the entire assembly leaks, and in the process of trying to remove it, the arm snapped off. I will never use a product from this company again due to this terrible product. What a waste.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointing. Paid a lot for this mirror and after two months of trying to get it to work without leaking i threw it out. Not only did it leak badly, but it appears to be made mostly of cheap plastic. And the metal piece that the razor hangs from had already begun to rust. This was a wast of money.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to replace my Sharper Image deluxe all metal shower mirror that finally sprung a leak after 12 years. They no longer make it. I&#x27;ve had plastic mirrors before the Sharper Image model and they were ok functioning, but kndd of looked cheap. This one is actually very nice. It looks great and functions great. I read the negative reviews and knew I was purchasing a plastic fixture. You do need to take precautions when intalling it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. 1. use plumbing tape and GET A WASHER, it needs one. Just a shower head washer from the hardware store or an old showerhead you have laying around.&lt;br /&gt;No. 2. Do not over tighten the fixture, you will break it.&lt;br /&gt;No. 3. Once installed, the only other issue I had was the arm tightening. Out of the 3 adjustments, the 360° (clock hand) adjuster is great. It has teeth and locks right in. The mirror (head) swivel also works fine. The middle (front/back) adjustment, however, can not be tightened enough by hand. It has a hand knob, but the weight of the mirror causes it to slide back down. You need to take a pair of pliers and CAREFULLY tighten it until the mirror stays in position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all. It&#x27;s been 3 months and I&#x27;ve had no issues.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the quick delivery and the quality of the mirror and attachments. This allowed easy installation and use. The mirror pivots and rotates from front to back for magnification very easily and is quite functional. The only downside is that the way it is designed, the water flow through the backside of the mirror to maintain the fog free surface---it does not fully fill all of the cavities back there and thus a part of the upper side of the mirror actually becomes fogged---this is not a big issue since the mirror is quite large and the lower part of the mirror is more than adequate surface for shaving.</li>
    <li> READ THE PRINT.  PLASTIC CRAP!  i can&#x27;t believe i paid this much.  tossed in dumpster. so mad, crap crap crap</li>
    <li> I have done this once already but here goes again.  Everything is perfect.  It works wonderful!  Looks good and works good...what more could I ask for.</li>
    <li> This item lasted about a month before it started going bad. The device never held the mirror in position without gravity moving the mirror to where it was unusable. I finally took it off and went back to the old school fogless mirror without the warm water bath to keep it fog free.</li>
    <li> I have had a Shower Tek mirror for over 10 years now but recently it started to leak. Wanted to buy a less expensive alternative. Needless to say you get what you pay for because this mirror is a piece of crap. The connection is so flimsy to the mirror that when it fills with water the mirror flops down and forward. Mine leaked everywhere and so much wasted water I had to remove it and return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor quality and a waste of money. Buy a Shower Tek.</li>
    <li> I now own three of these mirrors for my home, condo and beach house. Shaving in the shower can&#x27;t be beat it is totally fogless and the magnified mirror is great for those of us that need readers.  Yes there are some plastic parts as some others have complained and you can strip the threads if you crank down to much (I did on my first one). But I have been known to strip steel threads, use plenty of Teflon tape and common sense when tightening.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This fogless mirror promises the same quality of the similar priced Sharper Image fogless mirror, which I should have gone with in the first play, but I like the adjustable arm idea.  What a piece of junk. This think leaked all over.  More water was coming out of the mirror than the spout once installed.  The mirror itself almost instantly fogged up because so much hot steaming water was coming out of the mirror.  Oh, and putting it on, I had to wrap Teflon tape like 20 times just to get the cheap plastic connector to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 words: Don&#x27;t waste your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is horrible.</li>
    <li> The plastic broke when the Plumber installed it.  What a waste of money?  I ended up buying a plain Fogless Mirror with suction cups. It works fine for Shaving.</li>
    <li> As the other reviewers stated about this mirror, it leaks so I returned it.  It leaked from the inside of the glass frame.</li>
    <li> I would have been ok with this product, but it is made of plastic and not metal, for the price about four times what it is worth.  It has all the things on it&lt;br /&gt;that anyone is looking for in a fog less mirror but, then I put put it on.  The&lt;br /&gt;mirror&#x27;s base is made of plastic, not metal, the plastic stripped out and now this mirror that cost $100.00, four times what it should cost.  Its now no good to me and I still need a fog less mirror for my shower.  I may have been fine with the price if it would have work.  but now I have a $100.00 piece of junk and no mirror and no one is sending me a new one...</li>
    <li> This mirror works great, I can see what I&#x27;m doing without my glasses. Only complaint is that it is a bit pricey. Only shower mirror I found with the same features, Fog free with 3x magnifier.</li>
