      <li>Estee Lauder is always a good decision.  </li>
      <li>Good.</li>
      <li>OKAY LOOK!</li>
      <li>The case is plastic, nice, but plastic</li>
      <li>All beauty Items are ok, my wife loved them.</li>
      <li>every thing was nice, I will order again..</li>
      <li>But the purple bag looks cheap, so it doesn&#x27;t look good for giving someone as a gift.</li>
      <li>Estee Lauder is quality but this set is just slightly more than a sampler of products.  </li>
      <li>Cheap cosmetic bag and trial size products!</li>
      <li>I know some people that swear by their products and they absolutely love this gift set.</li>
      <li>The cosmetic bag looks cute too.</li>
      <li>Packaging was appropriate for the size container</li>
      <li>Very good I can try those classic estee lauder samples before commit to buy a full size.</li>
      <li>btw are usually fantastic but DONT GET THE MASCARA IN YOUR EYES</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll find that the transparent shipping bag it arrives in worth more than the flimsy purple bag included in the package.  </li>
      <li>the bag is really cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shiny cheap plastic with a flimsy zipper.</li>
      <li>Ok, I don&#x27;t remember Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder having problems with decent vanity bags before.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and good products and cool personal item bag.</li>
      <li>you will know that these are like the free gift when you spen a certain amount of money</li>
      <li>Gotta tell me what kind of word you actually needed</li>
      <li>it was everything that was expected from the pictures and descriptions it really made a great gift.</li>
      <li>The extra word was required in this section so here is a whole sentence that is much more than a word that is needed.  </li>
      <li>so you could understand that I really had nothing to add.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Delivery of the merchandise was fast product was intact</li>
      <li>This pack was really bargain</li>
      <li>Product too small for the available price which was originally posted.</li>
      <li>Products represents high quality.  </li>
      <li>Very small samples in a cheap, flimsy cosmetic bag not represented accurately by the picture.  </li>
      <li>Look much better in the picture a little desappointed</li>
      <li>Everything else is fine, but the bag spoiled the whole impression, at least it wasn&#x27;t a gift, or it would have been shame.</li>
      <li>The majority of the items are just samples and the box came full of tape that I had to destroy the outside wrap.</li>

<li> A nice way to get to simple Estee Lauder products without paying for the very expensive items.</li>
<li> YOU CANT EXPECT BIG PRODUCT FOR $35 or so in price when you can hardly get one product by Estée Lauder in the real world</li>
<li> Consider it if you want to buy as a gift, you will end up to destroy the outside box and have to present only the bag.</li>
<li> This product is grossly misrepresented and extremely overpriced.  </li>
<li> Huge disappointment.</li>
<li> She&#x27;ll think your relationship is cheap, artificial and deceitful.</li>
<li> It is Not what I expected from picture.</li>
<li> The bag is not the same as the picture shows, there looks like a hard case but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Definitely not worth the money.  </li>
<li> This is a waste of $$$$$$$$</li>
<li> Also, the kit arrived missing the \\&quot;cleanser.\\&quot;  </li>
<li> I have read about all these pple whining about how small everything is because they didn&#x27;t to their research and dont know anything about Estée Lauder and the products</li>
<li> I am not satisfied with the product sizes.</li>
<li> Not a great value and NOT worth a $135 dollars.  </li>
<li> Not worth the price, Oil of Olay works just as well and is not as expensive.  </li>
<li> come in SERIOUSLY!</li>
<li> your eyes will burn like crazy and will ruin your makeup.</li>
<li> I am a bit disappointed with this purchase.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t go off of the picture that is not what it looks like defiantly false advertisement!!!!</li>

    <li> OKAY LOOK! If you&#x27;ve EVER freaking been too Estée Lauder you will know that these are like the free gift when you spen a certain amount of money THESE ARE SAMPLE SIZES. YOU CANT EXPECT BIG PRODUCT FOR $35 or so in price when you can hardly get one product by Estée Lauder in the real world come in SERIOUSLY! I have read about all these pple whining about how small everything is because they didn&#x27;t to their research and dont know anything about Estée Lauder and the products btw are usually fantastic but DONT GET THE MASCARA IN YOUR EYES bc your eyes will burn like crazy and will ruin your makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product and good cleanser!</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder is always a good decision.  Products represents high quality.  I&#x27;m very happy with this line.  The case is plastic, nice, but plastic, I thought it was satin, probably my mistake.</li>
    <li> rip off! Cheap cosmetic bag and trial size products! Picture does not represent the product that i recieved! If it wasn&#x27;t a gift, i would be returning!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good products and cool personal item bag.</li>
    <li> Very small samples in a cheap, flimsy cosmetic bag not represented accurately by the picture.  Definitely not worth the money.  Huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> All beauty Items are ok, my wife loved them. The bag is not the same as the picture shows, there looks like a hard case but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product is grossly misrepresented and extremely overpriced.  You&#x27;ll find that the transparent shipping bag it arrives in worth more than the flimsy purple bag included in the package.  Also, the kit arrived missing the \\&quot;cleanser.\\&quot;  Do yourself a favor and avoid this product.  Fellas, don&#x27;t gift your lady this joke of a package.  She&#x27;ll think your relationship is cheap, artificial and deceitful.</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed with this purchase. The majority of the items are just samples and the box came full of tape that I had to destroy the outside wrap. Consider it if you want to buy as a gift, you will end up to destroy the outside box and have to present only the bag.</li>
    <li> This item is nothing as portrayed I wish this was ebay......so I could have my money back guarantee. This is a waste of $$$$$$$$</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder is quality but this set is just slightly more than a sampler of products.  Not a great value and NOT worth a $135 dollars.  It was a gift for a fan of Estee Lauder and frankly I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Good. But the purple bag looks cheap, so it doesn&#x27;t look good for giving someone as a gift.</li>
    <li> Product too small for the available price which was originally posted.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t go off of the picture that is not what it looks like defiantly false advertisement!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> Delivery of the merchandise was fast product was intact it was everything that was expected from the pictures and descriptions it really made a great gift. Packaging was appropriate for the size container</li>
    <li> This pack was really bargain</li>
    <li> I received this set from my friend as a birthday gift. I really like it. Very good I can try those classic estee lauder samples before commit to buy a full size. The cosmetic bag looks cute too.</li>
    <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t remember Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder having problems with decent vanity bags before. Everything else is fine, but the bag spoiled the whole impression, at least it wasn&#x27;t a gift, or it would have been shame. It&#x27;s shiny cheap plastic with a flimsy zipper.</li>
    <li> every thing was nice, I will order again..</li>
    <li> the bag is really cheap. It feels like something you would get at walmart for $20.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a great collection of items by Estee Lauder. I know some people that swear by their products and they absolutely love this gift set.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price, Oil of Olay works just as well and is not as expensive.  I think they raise the price just because of the name.</li>
    <li> What can I say.  It was a good price for a good product that made an impressive Christmas gift. Opps! The extra word was required in this section so here is a whole sentence that is much more than a word that is needed.  Gotta tell me what kind of word you actually needed so you could understand that I really had nothing to add.</li>
    <li> It is Not what I expected from picture. I am not satisfied with the product sizes. Picture is misleading. Sizes are travel sizes.</li>
    <li> A nice way to get to simple Estee Lauder products without paying for the very expensive items.</li>
    <li> wonderful gift for my family Great deal</li>
