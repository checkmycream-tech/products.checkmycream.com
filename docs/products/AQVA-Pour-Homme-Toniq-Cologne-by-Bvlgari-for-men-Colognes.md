      <li>He loved it, so I&#x27;m happy about that.  </li>
      <li>My nephew was so happy when he opened his gift, this is his favorite cologne!</li>
      <li>I sprayed this on after readng good reviews about it.</li>
      <li>Hello Good Days ..</li>
      <li>Great gift for people who likes perfumes with light scent..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a Bvlgari Aqva before and it was really nice</li>
      <li>Bottle is unique and the shipping was great.</li>
      <li>Bought a bunch for my young nephews as holiday gifts--they all smell great!</li>
      <li>, i wish they can work on it try to give customer more</li>
      <li>If you want your bf or husband to smell like a men and not a highschool kid buy this he will love it to</li>
      <li>My husband likes it too :)</li>
      <li>Toniq is one of the colognes I enjoy using in the summer because it is refreshing.</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s not the realy Bvlgari Aqva, but it still smells great and the bottle looks the same.</li>
      <li>The transaction was smooth and the cologne price was very good compared to other websites I researched.  </li>
      <li>Not too strong, just right.</li>
      <li>NOt too strong, very soft and sexy scent.  </li>
      <li>do love it thanks.</li>
      <li>worth the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made from lemon and peppermint essential oils that blend with Posidonia sea weed and amber giving it a very fresh, and slightly sweet, scent that will last up to 10 hours.</li>
      <li>Our favorite, above ALL others, is still PS by Paul Sebastian, with Creed&#x27;s Royal Water and Imperial Millesime tying for second.  </li>
      <li>This, so far, has topped the numerous others he&#x27;s tried, very easily giving it our 3rd highest ranking.  </li>
      <li>HIghly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Like all these scents, how the product works with your body chemistry is the most important and that is almost impossible to tell unless you try it somewhere first.</li>
      <li>I like Bvlgari Aqva a lot, so I decided to try the &amp;#34;toniq&amp;#34; version, almost identical to the original aqva but slightly fresher scent, definitely my style.</li>
      <li>Where was this when I was young and single?</li>
      <li>It smells like a combination of freshly mowed grass, a small glass of grapefruit juice, and a whole lot of Bravado.</li>

<li> wrong product review, my review should be for the Marine Toniq one, although I intend to buy this one as well, so I think I might just have to edit my review then.</li>
<li> and unfortunately I could not do it ...&lt;</li>
<li> /&gt;very ... but very uncomfortable</li>
<li> I am very uncomfortable with you, because the product did not come with the presentation to that seen here ..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
    <li> It smells like a combination of freshly mowed grass, a small glass of grapefruit juice, and a whole lot of Bravado.</li>
    <li> Great gift for people who likes perfumes with light scent..</li>
    <li> I was with a friend, a lady I work with, and in the store. I sprayed this on after readng good reviews about it. I asked her what she thought. She said it was \\&quot;Hot\\&quot;. I ordered it here because it was like 1/2 the price. Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve search for desirable scents. The BVLGARI products are too citric for me. I continue to experiment but today&#x27;s women I belief would prefer the scent of C. Dior for man, Dolce &amp; Cabbana the one, or Terre D&#x27;hermes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Bvlgari Aqva before and it was really nice but this one i got online was different from what i had. Actually the one that i had was not exactly this one (it was another flavor and smell). I wish I can return it and get the one i had before :(</li>
    <li> I ordered this cologne for a Christmas gift for my nephew.  The transaction was smooth and the cologne price was very good compared to other websites I researched.  My nephew was so happy when he opened his gift, this is his favorite cologne!</li>

    <li> Hello Good Days ..
