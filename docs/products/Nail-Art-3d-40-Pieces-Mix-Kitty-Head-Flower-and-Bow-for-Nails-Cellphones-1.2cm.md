<li> clear white glittery  </li>
<li> Most of them were painted very poorly and I would never use them.</li>
<li> /&gt;they have flat backs and i received a gift of sticker nail strips/ guards like for french manicures</li>
<li> Its flat on the back part</li>
<li> The picture shows that the heads are different colors (blue, white and pink)</li>
<li> not flat too big for nail art not much for the price</li>
<li> /&gt;-clear white glittery kitty with pink bow</li>
<li> It makes it look very strange.</li>
<li> Keep in mind they are a little big, so people WILL notice them on your nails, and they will snag on your scarf, your hair, your jeans when you&#x27;re trying to pull them up, whatever.</li>
<li> Its a little too big for nails.  </li>
<li> Out of the 40 pieces I can only use a few.</li>
<li> kitty with pink bow</li>
<li> each of&lt;br /&gt;- pink kitty with pink bow</li>
<li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
<li> Out of the ones I received, less than half were usable.</li>
<li> Some did come with some aesthetic defects such as random black spots, a crooked nose, etc.</li>
<li> and I was also missing a few.</li>
<li> I was surprised when I got them and sad bc</li>
<li> it was hard to work and have it stay on</li>
<li> only problem was almost 10 of them were a bit defected in terms of missing eyes, whiskers or noses :c</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m kinda disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the ones on the picture shown above.</li>
<li> and when I got them they smelled weird but after a while the smell went away</li>

    <li> These are really cute!! And inexpensive too!! Keep in mind they are a little big, so people WILL notice them on your nails, and they will snag on your scarf, your hair, your jeans when you&#x27;re trying to pull them up, whatever. I love crazy fun nails, so I can put up with the snagging. Some did come with some aesthetic defects such as random black spots, a crooked nose, etc. But most were in good condition. Other than that, they&#x27;re really cute!</li>

    <li> These are made of plastic and very light. Its flat on the back part so it kind of sticks out of your nails instead of wraps on it. Its perfect for cellphone cover decor never for nails</li>
    <li> I love my hello kitty heads however I did NOT recieve these ( the ones I ordered ) instead I got white ones with different colored bows. I was surprised when I got them and sad bc they weren&#x27;t the ones I ordered or wanted!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
    <li> This nail art pieces are cute  (too big for nails for my taste) but i only got white ones with red flowers. i didn&#x27;t got any of the ones the show on the picture, that was a bummer!</li>
    <li> Out of the 40 pieces I can only use a few. The nose color is marked close to the eye.  It makes it look very strange.</li>
    <li> I have not yet used this but I am going to be puting them on nails and making art on the nails</li>
    <li> There very cute but they are kinda big and when I got them they smelled weird but after a while the smell went away</li>
    <li> so cute and I have used most of them already will reorder soon</li>
    <li> Out of the ones I received, less than half were usable. Most of them were painted very poorly and I would never use them. Some were stuck together and I was also missing a few. The picture that represents them definitely looks way better than what I received. I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> came in the estimated date given. I like that it fits my nails good but I&#x27;m kinda disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the ones on the picture shown above. The picture shows that the heads are different colors (blue, white and pink) I received in the mail white headed hello kitty with different color bows.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product, it was exactly what I wanted very pleased and will order more products from this Distributor</li>
    <li> These 3D art pieces are so much fun.  My nail person puts them on my nails with the gel and they are very fun and durable.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Its a little too big for nails.  But great for other things...</li>
    <li> the decoration was too big for a nail, It can go on the nail but it is big. it&#x27;s more like a cell phone decoration.I wish i would have known. It should have a pic with it shown on a natural nail, so that buyers will know what there getting.</li>
    <li> Love the clear and blue hello kitty&#x27;s! You don&#x27;t see stuff like this in store. And the amount you&#x27;re getting for the price is fantastic! Great product</li>
    <li> Not exactly as pictured but still cute.</li>
    <li> not flat too big for nail art not much for the price it was hard to work and have it stay on</li>
    <li> Perfect for decorating phones. Arrived sooner than expected. Cute pastel colors. Might be a lil too big for nail art but you can manage to make it work.</li>
