      <li>im loving it</li>
      <li>All in all, wonderful lotion, smells awesome, but this is definitely not my favorite of the Designer Skin series.</li>
      <li>i choose this product because some one else used it,like the product, very easy to use, i would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>The product is very good and the delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>By far one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used - no streaking and</li>
      <li>Honestly i think i will just purchase from my salon when theres a sale, just to be sure i dont get more cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it, but I will make sure my delay on the tanning bed is set for longer than 5 minutes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
      <li>I will never buy another lotion offline again, there are too many things that can be tampered with.</li>

      <li>Could possibly be the best tanning lotion I have ever used</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the color it gives me.</li>
      <li>At the tanning salon, this product will cost you in upwards of $100.00 or more.</li>
      <li>so I have more time to spend rubbing this product in well....</li>
      <li>The smell could be better</li>
      <li>Love this one..</li>
      <li>You get a great tan, softens your skin and the tan really lasts quite awhile.</li>
      <li>It allows your tanning time to produce better results.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not terrible either.</li>
      <li>My favorite part about it is that it never leaves me greasy because of the silicone in the product.</li>
      <li>Not that many but still.&lt;br</li>

      <li>just make sure you wash you hands after applying lotion.</li>
      <li>I love it and love the price.</li>
      <li>Definitely one of the best lotions by Designer Skin!</li>
      <li>I received more color using Swedish diamond tingling bronzer.</li>
      <li>To use it, I have to mix it with another lotion that smells a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;Price on Amazon is a lot better than at the salon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>tans just ok.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Lotion is really good but the color you get from it seems to fade really fast. If you tan constantly this lotion is great, but if you tan twice a week I suggest another lotion. Designer skin is the best brand of tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I almost feel as if this lotion is fake, like someone filled the bottle up with Jergen&#x27;s lotion, not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Great product for the summer, highly recommend this product for the serious tanner. Although it took a little longer than expected, but over all worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I loved the black noir, it leaves your skin smooth after tanning and it smells great!  I would defiantly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This really made my skin look more tan because of the bronzer! I will definitely use this all of the time.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for YEARS so I know what it smells like. The product I received was not the same consistency as the product I generally buy at the salon. It also smelt different. It smelled partially like baby lotion. So it&#x27;s very clear to me that the sellers scammed me. They mixed baby lotion with the tanning lotion. I am an avid tanner. I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of the best I have used. I get such a great color after laying in my normal bed the ovation. It normally would take 2 to 3 sessions for me to get the color I am now with my old lotion. Now I get that color in one session with this lotion! It&#x27;s a GREAT deal to buy it off amazon. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work well, I did see a difference after about two sessions. I love that I got this product for about 60% off retail price! However, I don&#x27;t like how strong the smell is after you tan. The Citrus smell of the lotion vanishes quickly. Oh, and be sure to wash your hands as soon as you can it turns you very orange. I used baby wipes right after tanning to try to get rid of the orange hands.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color it gives me. It&#x27;s very well worth the money. &lt;.3 Plus it smells great. :)</li>
    <li> i have purchased several Designer Skin lotions from heavy bronzers to tingles. i will say i absolutely love the the effectiveness of the bronzer. you notice it right out of the bed. my only complaint is that i feel this lotion has a warming effect like the Designer Skin \\&quot;Obsidian\\&quot; which i personally am not fond of. almost every time ive used it ive felt hot for hours afterwards (and no, not because i was burnt.) I also shower about 4 hours after every tan session and this lotions wonderful bronzer seems to disappear with a shower which is kind of discouraging. All in all, wonderful lotion, smells awesome, but this is definitely not my favorite of the Designer Skin series.</li>
    <li> Lotion is absolutely legit im loving it already there has been complaints about the smell but tbh i don&#x27;t find it bad at all! Buy from solarium there lotion is legit and shipping comes hours before the expected time they also give you free 2 day shipping!</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotions I have used. I would recommend to everyone... just make sure you wash you hands after applying lotion.</li>
    <li> After some lengthy consideration, I finally broke down and bought Black Noir. I had heard way too many amazing things about it, and absolutely loved the smell!! I&#x27;m also a huge fan of Designer Skin and was excited about this lotion...however, after using it just once, I became extremely streaky &amp; it turned my hands orange!!! And I am DARK to begin with!!!! I would definitely make sure you take the time to rub this lotion in EXTREMELY well or you WILL end up looking streaky. I would definitely not recommend this to first time tanners...I had problems with it and I&#x27;m an experienced tanner who is pretty dang dark....I will continue to use it, but I will make sure my delay on the tanning bed is set for longer than 5 minutes so I have more time to spend rubbing this product in well....I would say this is not worth the $110 price tag. I&#x27;m actually using JWOWW 50x and an Austrailian Gold intensifer and I prefer those over this...pretty sad coming from a big DS fan...they missed the mark on this one. Does not live up to all the hype.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it worked as well as what I&#x27;m used to, and it really caused me to stink afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion right now! It smells wonderful, a light citrus, and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a burnt smell after you tan. The lotion is thin and easy to apply and gives you a luminus bronze glow after only a few sessions without an orangy tint like some other lotions. It&#x27;s really well priced on Amazon, my sister owns a tanning salon and sells it for around $100.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it! She&#x27;s never tried tanning lotion before but loves the smell and it never gets streaky or makes her hands that orange discoloration</li>
    <li> Love this product, I notice a huge difference just after two days of using this AND it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy after tanning.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream to use in the tanning booths. It works well for me but every one&#x27;s skin is different. You can get samples that you pay for at the tanning salon, use it to see how you like it and go from there. This is very expensive and that&#x27;s why I advise you to try a sample packet. The price on this site is very good and I have checked around.</li>
    <li> I love it and love the price. it&#x27;s usually $130 in the tanning salons so this was a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Being a tanning junkie..I have bought them allll!  Love this one..leaves your skin feeling amazing and you dont smell funky you know..like you just got out of a tanning bed!</li>
    <li> this is the best tanning lotion she has ever used. Bought it here on Amazon for a 1/3 of the price they sell it for in the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I am devoted to Designer Skin products.  I started with Black 20x and now Black Noir.  I gives you a rich bronze tan without any streaks or orange coloring that other tanning products do.  Within 2 uses I did see a darker tan.</li>
    <li> By far one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used - no streaking and no after tanning offensive smell the smell. It&#x27;s the real thing without the tanning salon price.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion online because of how significantly cheaper it was versus in the salon. I brought my lotion in to use, super excited to see what results it would give me. The lady who works at my salon instantly recognized the bottle and asked where I got it and I told her off of Amazon. She gave me a worried look and said lets compare the bottle in the store to the one you have. The one they had in the store was WAY thicker and a darker consistency, the one I bought was watery and more of a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; color rather than a dark brown color. She also said that the first ingredient should be aloe and first one on this bottle is water. After doing some research I am convinced and very disappointed that I bought a FAKE BOTTLE!!!! I will never buy another lotion offline again, there are too many things that can be tampered with. She also informed me that tanning lotions only have a shelf life of a year and we are not guaranteed of when this product was produced. VERY disappointed, wish I could give zero stars.</li>
    <li> i choose this product because some one else used it,like the product, very easy to use, i would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used the his product in my solon and it works great for me. I normally do not tan much at all but this product really makes a difference.  I went on Amazon because my salon charges $110 per bottle. I was a little nervous that it might be different than the real thing but it is the real deal. Very glad I got the lotion on amazon</li>
    <li> I really had my hopes up when it arrived and I was disappointed after using it. I really don&#x27;t think it worked at all and I get better results with stuff that is half the cost.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Works awesome!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be getting a bottle of Black Noir, but all i ended up getting was a bottle of cocoa butter.........not cool.  Anyways, so buyers beware I purchased this from seller The Best Beauty Finds. Well I found my money back in my wallet with this garbage. Honestly i think i will just purchase from my salon when theres a sale, just to be sure i dont get more cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and is on her second bottle... She will continue to order it and use it.. It was delivered promptly and and with great service .</li>
    <li> Black Noir is a great lotion! Goes on super smooth and smells good. I love the color this lotion gives me! Definitely one of the best lotions by Designer Skin!</li>
    <li> Smelled bad,did nothing but frustrate me . I have e been using Indoor tanning lotion for years. I knew instantly it was&#x27;t what it was represented to be.Very disappointingI went a whole two weeks with almost no results(I think it&#x27;s because I put some coconut oil in my fake lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Already used one bottle and just bought another last night. Much cheaper online than at the tanning salon. Smells good and goes on like silk rather than those cheap, thick lotions. You pay for what you get when it comes to tanning lotions and paying a little extra for a good lotion is well worth it. It allows your tanning time to produce better results. I lose my color very fast, but usually tan fairly easy. I am very dark after going through this bottle. It lasts a lot longer than you would expect too. You don&#x27;t have to use as much as some other lotions. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because I didn&#x27;t believe that one little bottle of lotion could enhance my tanning results so dramatically, but I was legitimately 2-3 shades darker within a week and these results lasted through periods of several days without tanning at all. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal and works great!</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting authentic lotion, when in fact it wasn&#x27;t. The smell was nothing like the real lotion, and the packaging  showed an obvious fake. I chose to return it before I tried it.  The return was easy and simple</li>
    <li> My sister and I were tanning newbies and the girl at the salon suggested we buy this but at over 90 dollars a bottle at our salon we thought, &amp;#34;No way!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So of course we bought it on amazon where it is reasonably priced even though we heard enough warnings that we could be buying bad, expired lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this lotion is perfect! Not expired at all! Smell great and goes on great! My favorite part about it is that it never leaves me greasy because of the silicone in the product. It goes on smooth, makes your skin incredibly soft, and works great in the tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a little after tan odor that isn&#x27;t great but it isn&#x27;t terrible. Plus most other lotions leave odors too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the bottle in and of itself is a piece of art that looks wonderful on a shelf!</li>
    <li> This product gave me barely any color. I received more color using Swedish diamond tingling bronzer. I will definitely never buy this product again...very disappointed</li>
    <li> Love this. Would recommend. this is a excellent product and I would definitely recommend and even buy again.thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I love this lotion! I can see a difference within about 2-3 tanning sessions. Wash your hands immediately after tanning and make sure you take the time to rub the lotion in completely. It&#x27;s definitely a favorite of mine!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this lotion before so I had high expectations for this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and I have a pretty solid, even tan. I have to watch my hands because if I tan with it all over them it can turn them kind of orange, but that&#x27;s not hard to do as long as I wipe them off before I tan. Great product, great price. Sold for over 100 at my local tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I just got this today. I can say so far that I prefer Luminary&#x27;s scent. Not a huge fan of this one but it&#x27;s not terrible either. Will be back later this week and update on my results. Very excited to try this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very late with this update, sorry! I actually am not a big fan of this lotion. Every time I have used it I have had that after tan odor, and the lotion tends to leave me sticky/gooey. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with streaking or anything like that. I&#x27;m still not a fan of the scent either. It did a good job with the bronzing though. If you want a great bronzing lotion by Designer Skin, I suggest Luminary. I didn&#x27;t have any of the above problems and I got darker with Luminary than I have with this one.</li>
    <li> Dont spend day after day in the sun or in tanning beds. This lotion will make you very dark in just 2-3 times in a tanning bed and will last for&lt;br /&gt;A week or more. I have tried them all but this is the very best. I also put on the black after tanning lotion morning and night.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the regular Black, and this one just seems even better. The smell isn&#x27;t so potent, and it seems less heavy. I get good color with it and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Every bottle of lotion I order online, I buy FROM AMAZON. I have never gotten a bottle of fake lotion, and if I did I could easily return it free of cost. So don&#x27;t go cheap to save an extra buck by ordering thru a different seller. Take the safe road and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I only buy tanning lotion here now, considering this bottle is over $100 in the salon. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I work in a tanning salon and all of my coworkers had great tans...except me. So I tried a sample of this at work and I was hooked!!! My results were instant! My skin doesn&#x27;t tan very well, it tans very slowly. After using this lotion about three or fours times, my coworkers were impressed! If anyone else buys this, jjust remember to rub it in well! If not, you may end up with a few spots. But they will blend in after a few more uses.</li>
    <li> All went well with delivery. I saved a lot of money with this product. So far I like this item because It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy or any type of residue or smell after tanning. it can also be used as a duel tanner. I saved a lot of money on this buying here.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It really helps tan you faster. It has a great smell that stays with you after you have tanned.</li>
    <li> This is some awesome tanning lotion!! I was so happy to find for $35.00 online instead of the $85.00 my tanning salon was charging me!! You get a great tan, softens your skin and the tan really lasts quite awhile. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Bronzer!! Its Incredible!! Only thing you need to be careful of is making sure you rub it in Very well!!</li>
    <li> The lotion is not oily and spreads evenly.</li>
    <li> This product smells very nice... citrus-fruity almost.  It made my skin soft and left a nice light bronzing effect.  No lines were noticed.. even on my hands! I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This black Noir tanning lotion did NOT work as well as the same lotion that I purchased from my tanning salon. I suspect that it may be diluted.  Yes, it is less than half the price ~ but, I am getting less than half the tan, while using it.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT purchase this product from this site again.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> First time purchasing this product, I like it!  I would purchse this product again; and definitely purchase other Designer brand products</li>
    <li> I loved it, gave me a nice tan with no streaks as I have read before. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I purchased a packet of this lotion at a tanning salon and liked it. Its scent was reminiscent of Designer Skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;Black,&amp;#34; but seemed toned down, which I liked. So I ordered a bottle of the &amp;#34;Black Noir&amp;#34; from Amazon. The lotion seems to be more strongly scented than what was in the packet. It actually seems more like the older &amp;#34;Black.&amp;#34; I could be mistaken, though, as I only tried one packet. I will say that with the lotion in the bottle I received, it is strongly scented. I like it, but it is too much of a good thing. And the scent gets on your clothes. I feel like I have to wash them right away to get the fragrance out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, this lotion is great! I use it by itself, without a tanning bed or sun, so I like that is has DHA. And its a great moisturizer too. I do not get orange hands fingers, as other reviewers wrote, but I wash my hands right away. Perhaps being in a tanning salon, they just try to wipe the lotion off their hands with a towel. I can see how that would be a problem and could result in unwanted stains.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to everyone wanting a deep tan this is a great product I am very happy with the overall condition of this lotion</li>
    <li> I used this lotion at my salon in a trial package.  The bronzer is great, the smell decent and overall an awesome lotion.  Trust me, I have tried them all.  Delivered promptly and a steal for under $40, when my salon is selling it for $120!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted... received in record time and the product is better than I had ever thought possible.  I am extremely happy.</li>
    <li> Love the product.!  I was just a bit worried when received the product &amp; noticed that it wasn&#x27;t a sealed container.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, goes on very nice and makes your skin feel very very good.  Great bronzer too, not as heavy as i&#x27;ve heard though, but I am a longtime user of smoke which has alot of bronzer.  Great product will be getting second bottle when this one is done.  Plus I got it for $40 rather than the $110 my salon was trying to charge.  So for $40 its a great deal I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he wanted to turn....not pale...and he loves it!  I have had this one (still do and still use it) for a while, and I bought it in a salon for like $130.  WASTE!  We compared the two, they are exactly identical- looks, texture, application, bottle, feeling, smell, etc.  So please do not spend a million dollars at the tanning salon... Invest in something cheaper online.  They jack up the prices way too much there because it is convenient.</li>
    <li> Awesome tannin lotion. My favorite so far. The lotion inside was real and definitely gets me tan on the first application. The smell could be better but I tan at the end of the day anyway.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as expected, a lot cheaper than what the salon charges.  I&#x27;ll order it again when I use the product up</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, spreads easily and a little goes a long way. Not my favorite smell but definitely not the worst smell either</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worked in a tanning salon for a year now and know what kind of consistency black noir should have and this product came a little watery for what it should have been, which makes me question how well it&#x27;s working or how old it is etc. the shipping time and price was great though. (:</li>
    <li> At the tanning salon, this product will cost you in upwards of $100.00 or more. They try to tell you not to buy it online because it is not the same. They were surprised when I showed them it was exactly the same for only $30.00.Awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lotion. Its soooooo expensive in the salons and the deal here was great! I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> Great product came brand new, but the only thing i have to say is if you don&#x27;t clean clean in between your fingers you do turn orange! And the smell after the tanning is disgusting, you have to shower right away, and i have found while showering i feel greasy. This did give me great color and people really have noticed how much darker than i am vs. walmart brand tanning lotion. Worth the buy if you want a quick tan but not worth it if your looking for long term tanning. I bought this 2 weeks ago, and use it all over my body every other day, and running low already. Bought another brand this time so we will see how that one does!</li>
    <li> Was super excited to receive this lotion, my roommate has this lotion but purchased it at her tanning salon so when I saw this lotion for so much cheaper I had to get it! When I finally got my lotion it was really runny and nothing like her lotion. I was very disappointed and wish I would have bought it at her tanning salon.</li>
    <li> I love anything Designer Skin brand- especially Black Noir. It smells wonderful and makes my skin glow! Excellent price too!</li>
    <li> Best product out there right now. At the price and oz get this one! Great deal and best tan for sure!</li>
    <li> Great product! You can see it working it&#x27;s magic just after first use. After 2 weeks I am looking nice and bronzed.</li>
    <li> This worked really well and I liked the scent a lot. I think that it&#x27;s a good product and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Black Noir is at a good price, and has good tones, but not real impressed on the smell. The smell isn&#x27;t horrible, but you can really tell that you had went tanning.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this lotion. She received her 1st bottle from an after prom prize and loved the results she got with it. She gets very dark with this lotion fast.</li>
    <li> I was told in my local tanning salon this was still one of the best bronzers out there.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of paying over $100, I bought through amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im satisified!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean its tanning lotion, no matter what lotion you use, I feel you are always going to smell like &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; afterwards!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my daughter that wanted to tan before prom and she loved it. She got tan really quick in almost half the time if she would&#x27;ve used another brand that she was using last year. The smell is also a refreshing smell, not your typical tanning bed lotion scent.  I recommend this lotion to anyone that needs a great lotion.</li>
    <li> The product is very good and the delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used anything, but designer skin tanning lotion for the last two years. I have loved all of their products, with the exception of black noir. It is supposed to be extra moisturizing and deposit color. This product is the first from skin design that has not only turned my skin orange, but is impossible to get off your hands. I brought water to the tanning bed to rinse my hands and they still look like I left cheap tanning lotion on them. Then, the color doesn&#x27;t deposit in random places because the lotion like blots up and rolls off. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or if this is common, but I will stick to the luminary (smells way better) and black 20x.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because of the smell. I cannot go tanning at lunch time, use this and come back to work because I&#x27;d smell terribly.&lt;br /&gt;It tans just ok. To use it, I have to mix it with another lotion that smells a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;Price on Amazon is a lot better than at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is creamy so you don&#x27;t spill it when you open it.&lt;br /&gt;It spreads easily.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with the container because the little sparkles come off and you get them all over your outfit and hands. Not that many but still.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used for a while now and at the beginning that I used it alone, it didn&#x27;t get me darker. I just kept the color I had. That&#x27;s another reason I use it with another lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary:&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. If somebody wants to give it for free, I wouldn&#x27;t take it. It does not tan and the smell is bad.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try one with a blue container.. I believe the name is Luminary or something like that.</li>
    <li> Could possibly be the best tanning lotion I have ever used and I&#x27;m a salon owner so that&#x27;s saying a lot!</li>
    <li> It has been and always will be my favorite tanning lotion... and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, it keeps your skin smooth and young looking.</li>
    <li> Has orange tint to it and was not happy w the look. Would rather just se black instead of this product</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!! I hit that plateau every person hates when trying to tan, but this lotion pushed me way past that in just 2 times of tanning at 15 min. I would highly recommend.</li>
