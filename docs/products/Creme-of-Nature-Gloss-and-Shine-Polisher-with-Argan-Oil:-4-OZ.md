<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this product in the store.  Initially, I bought it for myself because I needed something to help keep that salon shine in my hair.  I decided to use it on my five year old&#x27;s hair and I was overjoyed by how well it helped in not only providing a delicate shine to her hair but how it also eased the detangling process.  It is better than Pink Oil because it is not heavy and it is light.  A small, dime-sized dab goes a long way.  I have been recommending this to my sisters for their children because we all have a history of \\&quot;knotty\\&quot; hair.  Great for parents who do not want to relax their daughter&#x27;s hair at such a young age.  Creme of Nature has some great products!!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in a magazine and couldn&#x27;t wait to purchase a full size bottle. This product is great for taming frizz due to the blend of silicones in it. If you&#x27;re not a fan of silicone then this product isn&#x27;t for you. It&#x27;s really for gloss and shine but I found an added benefit of taming my frizzy hair. You will have to cleanse your hair after using it but I can say that it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I love cream of nature products very good on my hair and daughters i will continues to use these products in the near future! I would definitely tell friends and family about these ans any others products thanks cream of nature</li>
    <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that the ingredients are not all naturally derived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like is that it really has helped my curly, and frizzy hair calm down and gives it a shine.  I also like the smell, although it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I&#x27;ll keep on using it as a staple until I find a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product that does better.</li>
    <li> THIS OIL IS GREAT FOR MY FLY AWAY FRIZZY AND DRY HAIR.I ALSO LOVE THE SMELL OF IT.ALWAYS KEEP A BOTTLE OF IT NOW!!</li>
    <li> This arrived in good time, has a nice light scent and left my hair soft and shiny without feeling too greasy. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this because it has the 3 main things I use on my own that makes your hair shine. Dimethicone.. Honey... and Olive oil. All 3 things I bought on their own and use on my hair. Since all of them are mixed in this spray I don&#x27;t have to put them on one at a time. But as usual, these companies add waaaay too much stuff, hardly ever just the right amount of stuff before they mess the product up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a lot of non natural products, and even some that arent, they should&#x27;ve left out the alcohol drying perfume. Not only does it stink (cant stand it), but perfume is just another alcohol, so in the end it&#x27;ll damage your hair... dry it out. It&#x27;s just like if you rubbed rubbing alcohol in your hair... same thing. No one with any common sense would want to do that, so I don&#x27;t know why these companies keep putting alcohol in their stuff that&#x27;s suppoed to moisturize... shine... whatever. It cancels it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was okay.. it shined at first but because I&#x27;m used to using the exact same products on their own without the drying alcohol perfume, I noticed my hair was actually dryer than when I do it myself without this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wont buy again unless they take out the stinky perfume</li>
    <li> This is a terrific hair product. It is very light and non greasy. It has a very soft, slight, pleasing fragrance. It tames  stray hairs and leaves a soft, natural shine.</li>
    <li> really like this product. small amount does the job to keep frizzes away. great on extensions.</li>
    <li> A lil bit goes a long way so u dont need to order often I ordered a few so it would last even longer and forbid if it everr discontinued id be so sad lol i love this stuff great to put on before straightening hair it keeps hair soft and managable good for human hair wigs too which i wear and my daughter uses on her hair WE LOVE THIS fast shipping too</li>
    <li> very familiar with this new line from cream of nature i use shampoo conditioner and leave-in conditioner just added the polisher to collection doesnt leave hair heavy light scent and a little goes a looong way. i use on my natural hair and my brazillian wave hair extentions.</li>
    <li> I brought this to use as a heat protectant. I found that it did protect my hair from the hooded dryer (or blow dryer), but it did nothing for my hair when I use my flat iron. My hair dresser gave me trial Bio Silk Hair Therapy, which is great, and I just brought Chi Silk Infusion since I&#x27;m nervous to go back to using this product as a heat protectant by itself.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the product pictured. Instead it was another product also in this line, but I&#x27;m not picky. Works wonders.</li>
    <li> This was a good product for my hair..It works wonders on my hair and leaves a natural curl to it as if i have a perm if you put it on your hair and not comb it it will leave a natural perm look.. Put is on after you take a shower.</li>
    <li> Product worked as described! Hair is shiny and soft, I received the product super fast. I am very very satisified.</li>
    <li> This is good and your service is EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> I love this polisher. I make the hair shiny without the greasy feel.</li>
