      <li>Axe can be a bit strong to take it easy on that first date with this stuff.</li>
      <li>, I actually like the smell too which can&#x27;t be said for many of the popular scents out there.</li>
      <li>As a female I can honestly say that this is an okay scent.</li>
      <li>Very fast, honest and very coorperative guys.&lt;br /&gt;Wishing to deal with him again.&lt;br /&gt;Item</li>
      <li>So if you wear this stuff in public just be aware that you may be causing someone a great deal of pain.</li>
      <li>Smells great and stays on longer than any other Axe I have used.</li>
      <li>Like the scent and the new spray top.</li>

      <li>it leans more towards beachy with a fruity spiciness to it but definitely not too Fem.    </li>
      <li>My favorite scent that axe makes and lasts long too</li>
      <li>This is the real deal, they all be axing for my number.  </li>
      <li>This is in my top 3 Axe scents (dark temptation, excite, phoenix).</li>
      <li>I really like this new bottle.</li>
      <li>I gave this four stars because it&#x27;s one of the few good Axe scents left</li>
      <li>This one is a new spice</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not one of those fresh \\&quot;Irish Spring\\&quot; scents or an overly masculine scent...</li>
      <li>M 11 year old grandson loves it, puts it on every day for school</li>
      <li>masculine if you will though it is not a problem whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Still i have it in the bathroom, one near the door, one in the car,</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got many compliments about the scent since I started wearing this, and I&#x27;ve mixed it up a few times to verify this</li>
      <li>Love product, but took a little long to receive.</li>
      <li>This might make people think the wrong idea, but its a really nice scent</li>
      <li>This smell is heavy enough to last through the day but light enough to not overwhelm company around you.</li>

    <li> Everything came broken.. U can&#x27;t use them at all..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright now how the bottle looked thogvh</li>
    <li> See my review on the 6 pak if Anarchy. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Son loved it...</li>
    <li> So I am a user of alot of colognes and sprays, my top scents topping the charts at over 150 a bottle. The smell of those expensive bottles are worth the overpriced names they come with. When AXE first came out with this one I was skeptical as I try all the new scents and always am not very pleased. I used to use AXE as a cover up smell after working out, or just a smell to throw on but after a few hours it would go away or not remain. Upon buying this it smelled lighter, a little less...masculine if you will though it is not a problem whatsoever. This smell is heavy enough to last through the day but light enough to not overwhelm company around you. It may not make angels fall from the sky however out of all my fragrances my girlfriend seems to prefer this over all of them because it is something she and I both like as a scent. I was giving axe no hope with this scent but it seems out of all of them there is a diamond in the rough</li>
    <li> Like the scent and the new spray top.</li>
    <li> As a female I can honestly say that this is an okay scent. It&#x27;s quite hard to describe... to me it has some wood undertones and a prominent coconut smell to it. Overall it&#x27;s okay for cheap cologne. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it doesn&#x27;t exactly drive me crazy either. More on the scent... It&#x27;s not one of those fresh \\&quot;Irish Spring\\&quot; scents or an overly masculine scent... it leans more towards beachy with a fruity spiciness to it but definitely not too Fem.    I gave this four stars because it&#x27;s one of the few good Axe scents left and it does it&#x27;s job.  (SPRAY SPARINGLY! AXE TENDS TO JUST SMELL LIKE CHEMICALS WHEN OVER-SPRAYED) ;)</li>
    <li> Axe bodyspray are the best. I really like this new bottle. it is very easy to use . the smell is great like always. It stays on you for good 24 hours for sure. Still i have it in the bathroom, one near the door, one in the car, lol LOVE AXE products</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product and ordered more of it. To me it mostly smells like a woody coconut. I had to gasp for lots of air because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be stronger than the Axe Temptation. It smells a little less masculine than the other Axe products I have used, but still enjoy it. I am an Axe collector, so I am looking to pile up on Axe before I can&#x27;t find the products anymore. This is in my top 3 Axe scents (dark temptation, excite, phoenix).</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 x 3 Pack and smell is awesome. I use the body wash and shampoo but can&#x27;t seem to ever find the body spray. Awesome product nicely wrapped. Will be buying again once I run out!</li>
    <li> Our boys love this body spray and it is easy to buy it on line and also cheaper. It works perfect.</li>
    <li> Great wife loves them.</li>
    <li> Very nice, mellow, powdery musky. Lingers thru out the day but not overwhelmingly so. Good for day or evening. Economical package.</li>
    <li> I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS MENS DEODORANT AND I AM A WOMAN AND WEAR IT. I THINK IT SMELLS INCREDIBLE AND SO I BOUGHT THREE OF THEM FOR MYSELF. I SMELLED IT ON A  MAN AND THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT SO I WEAR IT MYSELF.</li>
    <li> Smells great and stays on longer than any other Axe I have used.</li>
    <li> Great for the guys. Cheaper then buying retail.</li>
    <li> Great price on a excellent smelling product, I love the design of the spray bottles also, not available in local stores with this size or design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got many compliments about the scent since I started wearing this, and I&#x27;ve mixed it up a few times to verify this was what people liked, but probably just as important, I actually like the smell too which can&#x27;t be said for many of the popular scents out there.</li>
    <li> very nice smell.. I fully recommend it</li>
    <li> Axe body sprays smells like crap and are triggers for people with migraines. So if you wear this stuff in public just be aware that you may be causing someone a great deal of pain. Enough to keep them locked in the dark for days, off work and out of commission.&lt;br /&gt;Just something to think about before you spend your money on this stuff. There are far better things you can buy.</li>
    <li> this Axe Spray must have it smells&lt;br /&gt;great of all axe spray i used this is number  1&lt;br /&gt;i get comapliments about this axe spray</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND LOVES IT...I LOVE IT TOO...EASY TO USE AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE...TRY IT YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT TOO!!</li>
    <li> I be sprayin this shiz all the time to hook the ladies.  They all be holloran when I walk by cuz I look and smell so good.  This is the real deal, they all be axing for my number.  I never leave the house without it.  I spray my pits and my junk.  The bitches always tell me my ball fro smells good.</li>
    <li> Spray is easily to use and have really good essence. I will definitely recommend it. Axe body was what I expect.</li>
    <li> Love product, but took a little long to receive.</li>
    <li> Very good scent. I always been fan of axe bodyspray. This one is a new spice and I like it</li>
    <li> M 11 year old grandson loves it, puts it on every day for school</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice manly body spray. Axe can be a bit strong to take it easy on that first date with this stuff.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent that axe makes and lasts long too</li>
    <li> Very fast, honest and very coorperative guys.&lt;br /&gt;Wishing to deal with him again.&lt;br /&gt;Item shipped in a nice good shape.</li>
    <li> Simply great. Of good quality, Does what it says. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the brand. You can go for it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Axe scents and I was able to get it for a good price.  Hubby is happy and so am I</li>
    <li> This is the only Scent of Axe that I  buy. Everyone at school says I smell really good. Love it</li>
    <li> This scent is quite obviously inspired by Hollister. Every time I catch a whiff of it on myself I&#x27;m reminded of the store. This might make people think the wrong idea, but its a really nice scent and I recommend it.</li>
