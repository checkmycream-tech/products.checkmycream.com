      <li>the cream and glove are a nice touch as well.</li>
      <li>Then the hair comes off in the shower with the handy glove.</li>
      <li>these products aren&#x27;t working, didn&#x27;t burn at all, the lotion is nice.</li>
      <li>The skin salve was also really nice after my shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep looking for an effective, reliable, odorless depilatory.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely the best solution for hair management around the man parts that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

      <li>This is very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Wow this stuff works great!  </li>
      <li>, this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I was also really surprised and impressed with the included moisturizer/calming cream...</li>
      <li>I am not a fan of taking a razor to the old marble sack and every hair removal cream ever is something you DO NOT want to put on your best friends for life.</li>
      <li>after I waited 14 min for my boy bits to marinate in this cream, I got in a luke warm shower like it says put the glove on and like magic</li>
      <li>To be fair, not every product works for everyone, but also to be fair, realize there are a rash of products sold online that pay people to give them positive reviews, so I don&#x27;t know where this one fits.  </li>
      <li>First off, this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to rub on and while it was warm, it never got to the level of stinging or burning.</li>
      <li>You can be sure of that.</li>
      <li>. Smells better than most hair removing products.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>And the website is hilarious.  </li>
      <li>Delivers as promised......easy use and outstanding results.</li>
      <li>A washcloth or loofah does the job of the glove with better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have never seen a better product that takes the hair off with ease.  </li>
      <li>I JUST LOVE THE STUFF .....</li>
      <li>Make sure to keep the timing</li>
      <li>While it removed most of the hair, it also seems to have taken a layer of skin with it.</li>
      <li>Even more hair did come off.  </li>
      <li>My favorite way of removing my hair.</li>
      <li>The smell is better, and it did rid most of the hair from my buttocks.</li>
      <li>did some research to find a better way and came across this product.</li>
      <li>Rub on, rub off, it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
      <li>Tried it with no glove, just using my hand and it seemed to be better afterwards.</li>
      <li>I think and works even better.</li>
      <li>Took the hair off my most of the skin too.</li>
      <li>Repeat purchaser that is satisfied with what I get every time.</li>
      <li>Worked in some areas better than others but removed most of the hairs that I needed off.</li>
      <li>The smell is better, and it did rid most of the hair from my buttocks.</li>
      <li>It removes most if not all the hair around my hairy arse.  </li>
      <li>the best part for me is that the hair doesn&#x27;t itch when growing back.</li>
      <li>Many reviews go into rather entertaining fits of pain fury over these creams; while I can understand why, you should know the pain isn&#x27;t THAT</li>
      <li>The follow up balm was also as good as it quickly absorbed with no greasiness.  </li>
      <li>I think I would be better off if I napalmed myself...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this product because (like an idiot I assumed by the name it would be the gentlest on my balls). I read the instructions very carefully and followed them to the letter. No issues till I started using the glove to remove the hair. Instant pain. It has now woken me up 3 times and I wish I would&#x27;ve read the reviews more carefully before I bought this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this a few times before I reviewed it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a hairy guy like me use something else.&lt;br /&gt;It will not fully remove the hair, and let&#x27;s face it a chemical burn on your junk is not something you should be looking forward to. Also if your hair grows like mine, your going to feel like you&#x27;ve got 5 O&#x27;clock shadow on your nuts befor noon rolls around. So combining lack of removal, growth, and a chemical burn equals a terable experience.&lt;br /&gt;If your going to be uncomfortable anyway I recommend sugaring. It costs pennies to make at home, it may be slightly uncomfortable to begin with but you can sooth the skin a lot easier, the effects last longer,( I mean no growth with in a few hours.), and it&#x27;s all gone and completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;However the way you go about it is up to you.</li>
    <li> kinda burns, you know. it was a compleat waste of my money.i would not recommend this product to any guy.</li>
    <li> Used as directed. Tried a test spot, &amp; it was great! No problems at all! Did a little on my chest &amp; my \\&quot;area\\&quot; &amp; I know I&#x27;ll be regretting it for days to come. It feels like someone took a magnifying glass on a sunny day to burn my nipple, &amp; my \\&quot;area\\&quot; is red &amp; irritated all over. After seeing so many great reviews by people who said they have sensitive skin, I thought I had finally found something that would work. While it removed most of the hair, it also seems to have taken a layer of skin with it. It&#x27;s been over 2 hours, &amp; I&#x27;m still in pain. The calm balm seems to help a little, but it burns on application. I plan on switching to some kind of first aid ointment before bed tonight. Waste of money. Wish I&#x27;d never seen it &amp; went with something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I bought this because the name made me laugh, BUT this product works really well. I use it and its far better than shaving. I finally used up my first tube, I order 3 more, the cream and glove are a nice touch as well.</li>
    <li> very nice, as advertised</li>
    <li> it will remove hair but to get any results you have to leave it on to the point where it is painful.  the instructions warn about sensitive areas for a reason it will destroy the skin if left on long enough to remove the hair. just man up and shave.</li>
    <li> did NOT burn at all, also did not remove all hair.  I guess it is good that there was/is no chemical burning, but there is some shaving needed after use so...I will not buy again, I&#x27;ll just shave.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Just a few notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trim to about a 1/4 inch first then apply&lt;br /&gt;Do Not Use if you have any open cuts or ingrown hairs. It wont really burn or anything but it seems to have a blood thinning effect.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really works, and it does its job well. I think the price is steep, but it&#x27;s almost worth not having to shave.</li>
    <li> It burns and burns bad!  Following the directions the product blistered my skin barely removed any hair.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the applicators. Also be extremely thoughtful and careful about this decision. I used this and it started to take some of the ball skin off with it. Just take care I&#x27;m not Risking this again.</li>
    <li> they could charge double for this stuff... thats how good it works&lt;br /&gt;if you have used nair you know about two things, the smell and the 7 minute number&lt;br /&gt;go 6 minutes and nothing happens, go 8 minutes and you are laying in the bathtub crying to Jerry Lee Lewis songs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after reading about bare balm on the internet (seriously) I gave it a shot&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed, wife was impressed, hell I think the neighbors are impressed&lt;br /&gt;I applied it and read the instructions and the 12 minute number.... I waited for the burn&lt;br /&gt;and it never happened, got in the shower hair came right off and absolutely no irritation or tenderness afterwards&lt;br /&gt;if you have ever burned your boys with Nair you know what I am talking about&lt;br /&gt;I dont review much but this stuff is A+ awesome,  I dont know why but Amazon told me I couldnt show you pictures... prudes</li>
    <li> Manscaping the manly bits can be really tough. This stuff works, it is easy, and you can do it yourself. I ordered some a while ago, ran out, and came back for more. Absolutely the best solution for hair management around the man parts that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Unlike some other reviewers, I didn&#x27;t have any bad reaction. Follow the instructions! No girl likes hair in their teeth so keep it clean down there guys</li>
    <li> Followed directions on the tube exactly...didn&#x27;t work. Thought maybe I didn&#x27;t do something right even though the directions are pretty straight forward. Tried it a second time a couple of days later and still didn&#x27;t work that well. All I got was disappointment in the product and some irritated skin from the second try. Some people say that it works for them and that&#x27;s great, but not for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT. Never shave your junk again.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Warning though, don&#x27;t scrub too hard or use soap afterwards!</li>
    <li> This did not remove the hair in the allotted time. In fact, it started burning before the hair was removed. The hair did not even remove completely</li>
    <li> My favorite way of removing my hair. I don&#x27;t actually use these on my balls as I can never get it to remove all the hair. I follow the directions but it does not work. I use this for other trouble areas that I am unable to see and it works great.</li>
    <li> I love it! The best product in this category for men... Super easy to use ... Apply everywhere, wait 10 min, go to the shower use the glove and done!</li>
    <li> I used it as per the instructions but it didn&#x27;t work. Had to do lots of rework. Stopped after using it couple of times as it takes lots of time and results not as expected. Not worth looking at the price and result.</li>
    <li> this product does work but its not for me. At best it looks like a poor shave job and id get a cleaner area with a razor and shaving cream. I wasnt given the sticks but no problem as i improvised with some craft popsicle sticks. One thing to be aware about is the smell it gives off, wow does this stuff smell bad as its sitting on you. It smells like sun screen in the tube but as soon as you apply it to your skin it smells terrible.I guess I&#x27;ll just let this sit and eventually end up tossing. I&#x27;m not mad about it as I&#x27;ve been meaning to test this stuff for a while. I guess this is good for the people that dont want to bust out the razor and shave themselves or just want a quick way to clean up but to be honest id rather go with the razor. Give it a shot if you like. This product just isnt right for me but it could be right for you.</li>
    <li> Major burn. Ate skin.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of taking a razor to the old marble sack and every hair removal cream ever is something you DO NOT want to put on your best friends for life. Then I stumbled upon Balls Balm. I ordered the single tube and found it does a fantastic job. Now I&#x27;ve ordered this one with two tubes so I&#x27;ll have it when I need it for routine maintenance. If you want your jubblies to be smooth and pretty without that horrid burning sensation, then this is the product for you, good sir.</li>
    <li> great product but I think you need to include an applicator tool with it. Also the holes in the remover are way too small.</li>
    <li> This product is an expensive, better smelling than Nair, type product. I followed the directions. I put cold water on my testicles to get them to shrink up. I put the product on my testicles and lower shaft and left it on for 10 minutes. I did a test area and no hair came off, so I left on another minute and then went to the shower and \\&quot;groped\\&quot; myself to get the hair off. I could barely touch my testicles they were burning so bad @ 11 minutes. I powered through massaging them to try to get the hair off. The hair was not removed from my testicles, but a little did from the shaft. I also did my buttocks. The hair removed much better from there, but left a lot of patchy areas....but it didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the \\&quot;calming cream\\&quot; and it helped my testicles for about 37 seconds, then the burning continued. Hours later the burning was still present and I could feel my buttocks, but they didn&#x27;t really burn; they were more sensitive. The testicles were very uncomfortable for about 10 hours and they are still hairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that Nair removes the hair better (but you are not supposed to use on delicate area&#x27;s) so my suggestion would be to just shave your testicles and shaft. Pro&#x27;s and Cons below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells better than most hair removing products.&lt;br /&gt;2. Thicker cream so it doesn&#x27;t drip.&lt;br /&gt;3. Comes with the tongue depressors to apply (but that was hard to do especially on the buttocks and bottom of testicles)&lt;br /&gt;4. Tubes are a solid material and durable.&lt;br /&gt;5. Glove is rough and could be used to exfoliate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1. Is thicker so it doesn&#x27;t drip, but applying it with the stick is hard and time consuming especially when you can only leave product on for a certain amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;2. It burns and leaves your testicles burning for hours.&lt;br /&gt;3. Did not remove hair from testicles, and left patchy spots on my buttocks.&lt;br /&gt;4. Glove smells odd like it was wet and then dried before shipping. *was very rough and not comfy on the testicles*&lt;br /&gt;5. Expensive&lt;br /&gt;6. Calming cream really did nothing (although I hope that it reduces the red bumps that I usually get later).&lt;br /&gt;7. Can still smell the product on my body hours after I have showered. (so if you had a hot date that night, he/she would probably taste/smell the product if they were visiting the \\&quot;boys\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good idea. The smell is better, and it did rid most of the hair from my buttocks. I bought it to remove the hair from my testicles, and it failed. If you want it for general body hair removal I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok (Nair is cheaper however), but for the sensitive areas I would not recommend this product.rough and not comfy on the testicles*&lt;br /&gt;5.

If you want it for general body hair removal I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s ok (Nair is cheaper however), but for the sensitive areas I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well, but takes a long time. I guess that&#x27;s the tradeoff for not getting your skin irritated. Does a good job, but doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 days before you have stubble again</li>
    <li> My girlfriends (the current included)always loved when I kept all my man parts well groomed. Well I started out shaving, that leaves razor burn. I tried waxing, not only did it hurt like hell, it barely worked. Foam Nair? well it took layers of skin off a few places and then ran down my legs and took the hair off of my legs also. Needless to say that is by far the worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried. Now as for BallsBalm, it has simply been amazing. No pain, at all. No hair is left, at all. No razor burn or ingrown hairs, at all. Not to mention the astonishing price. BallsBalm is definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how unhappy I am with this junk. I tried a small test patch at first just to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any weird reaction to the product so when I woke up the next morning and everything looked good I slathered up and set a timer. Even with removing the creme two minutes earlier than their reccomended minimum time, on far less sensitive areas of the body than they say it is designed for, it still managed to turn my skin into a blistered mess. All while leaving the majority of the hair behind. It removed maybe 20% of the hair I applied it to and the rest just broke off well above the skin leaving a badly damaged, but still firmly rooted hair that itched like something fierce and looked awful. I ended up spending more money on first aid products to deal with damage this stuff did than on the item itself. I don&#x27;t even want to imagine trying to use this stuff on any of the more tender bits.</li>
    <li> So I have used this all over my body EXCEPT my balls (which I just prefer to shave anyway) and I really don&#x27;t have a major complaint at all. It removed 90% of the hair on my chest, upper legs, ass and pubes with no burning whatsoever or discomfort. Some people reviewing were disappointed that it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair completely but I think that&#x27;s to be expected--with products like these, when there&#x27;s no more hair to dissolve, it moves onto reacting your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought this without reading any of the reviews and then got super nervous when I read that some people had horrible reactions. I tried it anyway because I had already spent the money and I&#x27;ve never really had any problems with skin products reacting badly in the past (maybe I just have tough skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it worked really well for me and gave me no discomfort whatsoever. That just goes to show that everyone&#x27;s skin is really different and you should test the product before going all out. The skin salve was also really nice after my shower. Be smart and you should be fine.</li>
    <li> For a product that claims to eliminate pain and humiliation, this one causes quite a bit. It&#x27;s delivered in the least discreet manner possible. The box is covered with huge labels that say &amp;#34;BALLS BALM.&amp;#34; Even worse, the product is totally ineffective. I followed the instructions to the letter, and after only 5 minutes I was totally blistered. My skin was inflamed and sore for a week, and worst of all the hair wasn&#x27;t even removed. A large amount of stubble was left, making my already blistered skin even more uncomfortable. Not worth the money!!</li>
    <li> The product works great!  Leaves the boys smooth and re-growth starts about a week later.  However make sure you stick to the time limit or shorter!  Having the product on I did not feel any burning whatsoever so that was great, so I thought I could leave it on a few minutes longer to make sure I get everything...mistake!  When I got into the shower and started removing the cream...HOLY MOLY! I had a chemical burn.  Learn from my mistake - don&#x27;t leave the product on longer than reccommended.</li>
    <li> balls balm works on longer body hair- it works slightly better on hair that has never been shaved- and does not burn ONLY on longer hair.  Unfortunately using it on short, shaved hair results in burns.  And what makes those burns all the worse is you won&#x27;t feel any pain until you or water touches the afflicted skin- short hairs DO NOT come off.  You stay smooth for 48 hours, then your girl or guy (it&#x27;s your choice) will push you away with, &amp;#34;Get off of me!  That stubble scratches!&amp;#34;  Eventually, I did use this on my balls and because I&#x27;ve never shaved down there, it worked without burning.  Hair grew right back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is, in essence, less smelly Veet.  If you choose to try balls balm, just buy the depilatory and use your hands to apply- the stick and soothing cream are useless, and a 59¢ wash cloth is as effective as the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep looking for an effective, reliable, odorless depilatory.  You should too.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works well.  Doesn&#x27;t stink like other products and didn&#x27;t (at leastt for me) irritate skin the way other products do.  Highly recommend for back or intimate hair removal.</li>
    <li> Its nair. Even though its advertised for your junk it is not any more sensitive than nair.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. It is time consuming to put on and keep track of when you started. But it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while now. Works really well if you follow the instructions. Definitely don&#x27;t leave on longer than they recommend or it starts to burn.</li>
    <li> Be sure to follow the directions to a Tee... Make absolutely sure you don&#x27;t leave it on for more than the maximum time... It will burn. If you follow the directions, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really keep the hair off any longer than shaving though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this before I even use the product. I will update after. One thing I can&#x27;t stand is not getting what&#x27;s claimed to be included and in this case it&#x27;s the slick sticks and the tip tops. All I got was exactly what was in the picture and not what was in the description. It also showed up in a plain gallon sized zip loc bag. I started with 3 stars and it can only get worse</li>
    <li> Works great, did not irritate my skin. Pro Tip: trim the hair first, that way you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
    <li> I would advise other guys to stay away from this product. I used it twice, following the directions with absolutely no results. I tried it once when my hair was about 1/2 an inch long and another time when my hair was about 1/16 to 1/8th of an inch long after shaving like a week before. This stuff just didn&#x27;t work for me and I feel like it was just a total waste of time and money. The only thing I noticed was that my skin was a little irritated after use. 0/10 would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work after 2 applications. But then Nair didn&#x27;t work either. Maybe if you have puny hairs, sorry, but I have man hair. these products aren&#x27;t working, didn&#x27;t burn at all, the lotion is nice. Going to try agitating the package maybe the chemicals separated in Storage</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually post reviews just because what one person likes, the next will not. However, I felt the need in this case due to the subject matter. I have never shaved my downstairs parts or done anything, but felt it would be a fun thing to do for my wife.  I started out trimming with a clippers but stopped after thoughts of me standing with my manhood in one hand, blood everywhere, trying to explain to the paramedics what I was trying to do. So, in the end I had trimmed my hair but had not removed it.&lt;br /&gt;I did some research to find a better way and came across this product. I was apprehensive to try this stuff.  Most of the reviews were great, but a couple were not so good.  In the end, I opted to give it a shot because there was no way I was going to be able to put anything sharp or mechanical that close to my stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in the mail quick. I closed myself off in the bedroom out of fear of the reviews that said it smelled horrible. I had visions in my head of a horrible rotten egg smell that my wife and kids would be asking what that smell is.  I opened the tube and took a smell. It was a different smell, but no horrible. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it as cologne, but it was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the cream to the area at the base of my shaft and my jewels thinking there was no way this was going to work. I waited ten minutes and jumped in the shower with the glove and started to go to work.  I WILL BE DAMED !! IT WORKS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first round most of the hair came off, but there were still a couple stragglers. I continued to rinse (NO SOAP) then pat dried. I then did round two and that did the trick. I&#x27;m bare and incredibly soft down there. I rinsed again (NO SOAP) and pat dried and applied the provided lotion to the entire area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not feel any tingling, burning or any pain initially and all was good.  A couple hours later I did feel  minimal tingling but it was so minimal that I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just in my head or if it was actually tingling.  No residual smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy with product !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it !!!  :)</li>
    <li> The reveiws wasn&#x27;t that bad on Amazon, so I had decided I had to try it. I couldn&#x27;t try this at home, because of my family, so I had went to my  college, where my best friend worked in the mens locker room.  Oh boy, the cream was heavy and thick.  So any way, I had put it on me on the &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; to get rid of the hair.  Sure enough I had to wait about 15 minutes before I had jumped in the shower.  In the first round  some hair did come off.  Second round, I had put a little more heavier dose of the cream on, and then waited fifteen minutes again.  Even more hair did come off.  WOW! Hey this stuffs works like a charm.  OK the third round,  I even had put more heavier dose down their, and  waited again for 15 minutes. Finally majority of the hair was long gone.  Another thing I suggest to the guys is wear loose shorts or sweats after this, for 18 to 24 hours. Because I had wore my jeans, and it was a little painful to walk and sit.  But otherwise a terrific product, and I recomend it to anyone who want to get rid of unwanted hair in any part of the body. The pungent smell reminded me of a,Bigen black hair dye.  But it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> This stuff barely works at all ! I have used it twice and both times I was left with stubble. Unacceptable.</li>
    <li> It worked great however it didnt last very long and I am really glad I had someone there to help apply it</li>
    <li> with a name like this you would think it would be kinda mild on the &amp;#34;boys&amp;#34; . well when you wake up in the night with atomic fireballs, you learn its not very mild at all. didnt do a very good job removing chest hair either.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best hair removal product by far , no smell , no burning, no redness just a great product. This will be my 4 order for the Balls hair removal that I&#x27;ve order for my friends and myself . I have never seen a better product that takes the hair off with ease.  I JUST LOVE THE STUFF .....keep up the good work !!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, keeps everything squeaky clean down below.  Great for other body areas as well and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff to keep it all clean, but I caution you to please turn off your cellphones when using the product and follow the time.  I lost track of time by a few minutes and ended up wrapping my junk in burn gel and gauze for about a week, and needed a doctor visit on top of it.  Burned balls suck!  I have used the product before that and since and have had no troubles and it does beat the hell out of Nair, but damn, you really need to time it!</li>
    <li> AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!  I bought it on the advice of a friend who swore it worked great.  I received it the other day and gave it a try.  Everything went great until after the shower.  I think I would be better off if I napalmed myself... I followed directions exactly and the end result is as if i was set on fire.</li>
    <li> Very good item and doesnt have a bad smell like other hair removal creams. It leave the boys feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately had a reaction to this product.  I was really hopeful that it would work.  Be sure to test your skin sensitivity before you actually use it.  You will appreciate it later.</li>
    <li> So much better than shaving, faster, cleaner, no ingrown.  Just be sure to shower before to make sure the skin is clean... I used it once after just coming out of the pool and I think the pool water reacted with it... made my skin burn a little.  but the soothing lotion that comes with it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use for just balls, or the whole pubic area, taint and even the back door.  No ingrown hairs, the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back sharp (so limited itchy sensation while growing back.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have bought for a friend and will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This works ok doesn&#x27;t burn your skin but still leaves a little hair behind probably work better with more time  I used the lowest time for fear of burning my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, if I rub hand sanitizer on I get red patches. So shaving down under isn&#x27;t really a option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it one night to see if I could handle it. 5 minutes later I was washing it off to see if I would react poorly. Nothing unusual, so the nextnnight I went ahead and did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only mistake was using the sticks. DO NOT USE THE STICKS! They are clumsy and I ended up with a burn on the place I started. That being said it did cause discomfort, but no pain. I live in Florida and work in the sun, I was expecting trouble but didn&#x27;t receive any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great product, just stay away from the sticks and use your fingertips.</li>
    <li> So I will update this later with long term effects, but I am so happy with the results of this cream that I am writing a review about 2 hours after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to be ambitious and try this on three different spots at once; my chest, my legs and my boy bits. The end result is a feel like a frickin&#x27; dolphin with eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I opted not to use the included sticks and just used my hands to spread this on myself evenly. The hardest problem if you are doing multiple areas is getting all of it timed correctly. I did my chest first, then legs, then crotch. Even though I set different timers to keep track of things, in the end I opted just to leave it on my chest and legs a bit longer then it says too, knowing I might be tempting fate, but if something went wrong it would be my own fault and I&#x27;d have no one to blame but myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my chest got about 18 minutes, my legs 16 and my crotch 14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was not so bad at all. Some people mentioned they did not like it, but while it was not something I would choose to wear as a scent, I would not call it unpleasant either. It was easy to rub on and while it was warm, it never got to the level of stinging or burning. I purposefully tried to avoid sensitive spots like my nipples, but accidently got some on them anyway. Even so, it didn&#x27;t burn or hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after I waited 14 min for my boy bits to marinate in this cream, I got in a luke warm shower like it says put the glove on and like magic the hair just slid right off! It was not only fun, but almost incredible to watch. The end results are this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs and Chest: There were a few small spots that I did not coat with cream as thickly as I should, or spots I just missed. Sometimes it&#x27;s just hard to do this kind of thing to yourself and you miss things. When I stepped out of the shower I felt amazing. I was smooth, soft and only small traces of hair were left in the spots where I missed the hair or did not spread it on enough. In the end I felt NO pain at all, not even any discomfort. I am just getting a kick out of both feeling my chest and legs, and seeing the totally unspoiled, almost baby like skin. Of course, make sure to spot check the cream to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction, but as for me, it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The Boys\\&quot;: Obviously I was more carful here, and more scared as to what might happen, but I&#x27;d read enough good things that I felt pretty confident. I did not put on a thick enough layer, and also at that moment I was not able to use the \\&quot;nutshell\\&quot; method they recommend, so there is a little more residual hair left. Knowing how to do this now, and how it feels, I am confident a second application would make things perfect. The cream felt a bit warmer on this area (as you&#x27;d expect) compared to my legs and chest, but again it never got to a point that I would call burning. The one mistake I made was applying it to the area in between my \\&quot;boys\\&quot; and my inner thigh, which had a small rash to begin with. Because of that rash, the cream DID irritate that one area. It was painful for about 20 minutes, but only when walking, and the included soothing cream helped with the burn. I knew that spot was more sensitive than the rest of my area down there, but I used the cream anyway, in direct opposition to the directions that say not to use it on damaged or already irritated skin. That being said, the same pain and irritation did not happen on any other part of me down there, so I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to sum up, I am very happy with this product and the only pain I suffered was due to me ignoring the directions. As it is I left it on parts of myself longer then I should have, and even so it led to no pain or burn of any kind. I will update with continued experiences with it, but for now, I say give it a try. Oh, and I am glad I bought the two tubes, because I used up almost an entire one this first time, and I am not super harry. I think the 2 is a safe bet. I myself will buy a 3 pack now that I know how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for listening.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, I did leave it on a little too long on my chest and my skin got irritated but that is my fault. When i did it downstairs I was very cautious and put it on for the minimum. Stuff worked like a charm. The soothing lotion is great to apply after the application.</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s been a week since I used this first time and I like the results. The process takes some time but that&#x27;s expected with hair removal creams. There was some slight burning discomfort for a day and a half after using it but now I know not to leave it on as long. The hair is slow at growing back and that&#x27;s what we all want. I&#x27;m definitely going to be a customer for a long time.</li>
    <li> works great,  no hair no skin irritation even on most sensitive areas, works just like they said. very easy to use</li>
    <li> This Product works. Everytime! I want bigger tubes of this stuff, because this is a hygiene staple now! Five thumbs up! :)</li>
    <li> Does an ok job at removing hair but be careful about burning the skin!</li>
    <li> It really works. Follow the directions!</li>
    <li> Ballsbalm is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like other hair removal products.  You have to leave it on a little longer than recommended, but it works really well.  No irritation at all.</li>
    <li> I have used a LOT of depilatory agents and shaving for excess body hair in more places than what this product calls for.  My first use went better than I could ever imagine.  It didn&#x27;t have the acrid odor most depilatories do. It went on easily and neat, not a bunch of dripping, and after entering the shower with the exfoliating glove, the hair just fell away leaving sking totally smooth without any skin irritation which you would expect in more \\&quot;tender\\&quot; areas of the body.  The follow up balm was also as good as it quickly absorbed with no greasiness.  I will use this from now on.</li>
    <li> I purchased ballsBALM for the first time several months ago in search of an alternate to shaving. At first I was skeptical, but decided everything is worth a try. Man... I was proven wrong. I&#x27;m actually very impressed with the product, and am returning to buy my second purchase and double the product.&lt;br /&gt;For lack of a better term, don&#x27;t be an idiot and you won&#x27;t get burned. After getting anxious by several comments myself at first buy, burning has never been an issue for me. I keep the product on for about 10-15 depending on the area and the rest is history. I use it once every week, and I&#x27;m overall satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Definetely try it out if you are in the market!</li>
    <li> It smells like big foots...genitals, but it works like a charm! Do be careful with the amount of time you leave it on.Please READ the directions... for your balls and shaft&#x27;s sake. Wish their was an item this good for a man&#x27;s face? Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> Product ships fast and works well.  Sure beats using a razor!  I find it better to apply a bit more liberally than recommended, but other than that, I&#x27;m a very happy return customer.</li>
    <li> Bought for someone that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have acct. here.</li>
    <li> Hell hath no fury like that of this product. Think of me as your guardian angel when I tell you that this product is a no-go. My skin is burning and red, the hair is not coming off fully and my balls are in absolute misery. It&#x27;s like Cerberus is gnawing at my nads and my forearms are getting spit-roasted. Save yourself the money and the misery of a tenth ring of hell and use a razor or accept your inner squatch.</li>
    <li> Product was absolutely terrible. Applied a thin layer, followed directions. Did absolutely nothing. Waited a couple days and tried again, this time I caked it on there nice and thick. It did remove hair, but the quality was worse than that of a razor. It left stubble, and it left quite a few stray hairs. It also gave me some small rashes. I also have a small scar from about 8 years ago. The cream caused me to bleed from there. Was hoping for a solution better than shaving down there. But this is definitely not it. Not worth trusting chemicals on your goods in hindsight</li>
    <li> Item was on time and as described</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says! No odor, no pain, not even a simple burning sensation (I know skin types differ but this was painless for me). Results are amazing. However, I needed to practice because when taking the hair off with the glove, it is hard to actually see if it&#x27;s gone or there is some residual hair until everything is dry. I had to shave off (the next day) whatever was left. I&#x27;m happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Skeptical at first, but works quite well, with much less pain and strain than shaving. Works on very coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Rub on, rub off, it&#x27;s like magic. Wish it&#x27;d get some chin stubble off, though, so looking to trying veet. But for those anal, genital, armpit and leg hairs, woosh and it&#x27;s like flush down the drain!</li>
    <li> I did two applications, and saw very little hair removal. Spotty, smells bad, and totally useless. Not recommended at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried other creams, and well I guess that my parts are a little too sensitive, which is why I purchased this product in the first place. First off, I did do exactly as was directed, but to my painful displeasure I still ended up burning a small amount of skin off of my nads and apparently &amp;#34;the dash between&amp;#34; as well...as I can&#x27;t see it but can definitely feel it! And do be mindful of the &amp;#34;starfish&amp;#34; area of the backside as well since it only takes a little dab making its way to the wrong spot to ruin your week! As or the chest area there was minimal irritation for me but as other reviews have noted it seems to leave stubble at the base of the follicle...more so than other creams I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a three for the marketing of the product (very humorous and great for a gag gift) and the fact that it DOES remove hair but not as well as some other creams. I have a feeling this is due to the reduction of the &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; ingredients to make it more suitable for your &amp;#34;nether regions&amp;#34;. So if you have sensitive skin than this isn&#x27;t the answer that you&#x27;ve been looking for in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The soothing after cream included is however very nice and soothing indeed...if only temporary, but it makes the skin feel very soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> First hair removal system.. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t leave the cream for longer than recommended, will sting later on. Make sure to keep the timing right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice - Trim first.</li>
    <li> For removing body hair this is the best thing I have used. No truly harsh smells and it works really well and quickly. I am a VERY hairy, knuckle dragging, 6ft 4inch Neanderthal, only the second person in my generation to stand erect. What I am trying to say is that I am HAIRY. This stuff works great and works faster than other products I have tried. Works so well that I have to caution other potential user to only put the cream on spots that you actually want the hair off. Because wherever you put it, even by over smear, the hair comes off. The Balls Balm is the bomb! It calms the burn after removing all that hair and works great even if you just need to relieve dryness between hair removal sessions. I recommend this product to everyone needing hair removal! I will be a return customer for sure!</li>
    <li> Delivers as promised......easy use and outstanding results. Had my doubts and felt funny buying this product, but it really works. If hair removal in delicate places (or anywhere else) is what you are after....and want a product that doesn&#x27;t burn or cause a reaction....this is it.</li>
    <li> Finally an option to shaving. Works 100%</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and very sensitive skin. So, shaving is not really an option for me.&lt;br /&gt;Found this staff by an accident. Review were generally good. So, I gave it a try. I tried it on different body parts. Didn&#x27;t write a review right away because wanted to see a long time effect. Conclusion: it works for me. Recommendations.  If u use it to remove a long hair, trim it first, otherwise cream will kind of trim upper hair but won&#x27;t be able to get rid of the roots, it just can&#x27;t get to it. :) If you are working your balls, follow instructions, it won&#x27;t work if your \\&quot;guys\\&quot; are hanging low. In my case it worked in 10-12 minutes. Felt warm at first but nothing terrible and warm feeling was gone in about a minute or two. Hair grows back really, really slow compare to shaving.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> ---- Update ----&lt;br /&gt;Used it a second time.  One of two things caused the heat sensation to increase slightly.  1-I left the product on for about 9 minutes this time or 2-I used it on areas that were de-haired the previous week.  Not sure which but the sensation still did not reach the level of discomfort.  I also realized that you need to slather it on fairly thick to take the hair off down to the skin.  I have a few places here the hair strands were shortened and thinned but are still present.  Still impressed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---- Original Review ----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this a while ago and was concerned because I saw some reviews on Amazon and on other sites that indicated some people have gotten mild to moderate rashes or at least some discomfort from use.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but on a rare occasion I will have problems with some product or another.  Not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as well as the description says it does and I didn&#x27;t have any problems.  Locations where I used the product are smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  I followed the directions and used the minimum suggested time for the first go-round.  I had very, very mild warming sensation shortly after application however it never increased to become a discomfort.  After in the shower the sensation decreased and when I put the balm on it went away entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair I used this on is fairly thin.  This means the strands themselves are thin, there are plenty of said thin strands, especially in places I don&#x27;t want them.  Hence me buying the product.  That may have made a difference in how well it worked but I would presume people with coarse hair would see some progress and the following week it could be cleaned up.  I hit pretty much everything I applied the product the first time around.  I can&#x27;t wait for the follow up application to refine the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy application, no discomfort and it works really well (smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt), the odor is hardly noticeable, takes aminimum of 7 minutes (max of 10 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None to-date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update the review after the next application if necessary, otherwise the review stands.</li>
    <li> I decided on a whim to remove the hair from my scrotum, shaft, and what women call the bikini region, to spice things up and since my wife always complained about getting hair in her teeth during fellatio.  This product is specifically designed for men&#x27;s nether regions and works much better than that drippy goopy Nair for women (which I tried that at first), because it is thicker and easier to spread on without making a mess.  It is less smelly and less harsh than Nair as well.  The only drawback is that it will leave the skin a little raw if left on too long (but not as bad as the Nair and this product does come with the Calm Balm for after application, though I don&#x27;t generally need to use it) AND it doesn&#x27;t completely remove my hair, leaving a little bit of a soft &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34;, particularly on the &amp;#34;bikini&amp;#34; region, but without the itchiness that comes after shaving.  I use it about once a week to keep things well groomed.  It is a bit of a hassle, but well worth it.  Rather than having to plead with her as a I did before removing the hair, now my wife can&#x27;t keep her mouth off of me!  I&#x27;m never letting that hair grow back again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m dead serious when i say this, but holding a lighter on you balls would feel better than using this stuff!! No joke!!!!</li>
    <li> If there is a product that works better than this out there I haven&#x27;t found it. The Bare Balls, Balls Balm is a gentle product that works simply and conveniently. My pair are bare, smooth, soft, and the best looking they have ever been! Not only am I satisfied, my woman is VERY happy as well! What more could a guy ask for!</li>
    <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin will react differently. As a caveat, I&#x27;d consider my pain tolerance to be slightly above average, but this is an honest account of exactly what happened when I used this product. Many reviews go into rather entertaining fits of pain fury over these creams; while I can understand why, you should know the pain isn&#x27;t THAT bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I tested a small area of what I considered to be sensitive skin (upper anterior leg just lateral to my lower abdomen) and waited 24 hours. After seeing very minor redness and no pain, I went for the rest. I left the cream on for 9-10 minutes and immediately removed in the shower. There was no pain while the cream was on. If anything, there was a minor warm sensation in some areas. But once I started scrubbing it all off with the glove in the shower, that&#x27;s when the discomfort started. It was manageable. Nothing to really worry about. Just like rubbing a minor sunburn with a fairly course wash cloth. Then the redness started (on my upper inner thigh. That&#x27;s when the pain started to increase. Again, manageable, but it got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t force myself to continue scrubbing even though there were small patches (albeit very small patches) of hair left. The cool water in the shower masked most of the pain. I rinsed for about 15 minutes (no direct soap) and got out. That&#x27;s when it really started to get uncomfortable. It felt raw and the red burn was apparent. I wasn&#x27;t panicking or terribly concerned, but I certainly wasn&#x27;t thrilled. The cooling cream helped A LOT, but only for about 30 minutes. The pain was just increasing. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, the ER crossed my mind. But I took some (likely naive) solace in the fact that this product has been on the market to the masses for a while and there was no way I was experiencing a completely atypical reaction that would cause permanent problems. So, I looked up a couple &amp;#34;in home remedies&amp;#34; for cream burns and saw some people on the Livestrong website recommend aloe vera. Makes sense, considering I use that for sun burns and it feels like Heaven. Do not use aloe vera on the area! The pain jumped 2-fold. I ran into the shower and rinsed it off, successfully mitigating the burning. But then I was back where I started before the aloe, and that was not comfortable. After several cooling cream doses and careful consideration to avoid contacting anything, I tried to sleep. At this point, even the cooling cream was stinging on contact. I was significantly uncomfortable, but I still wasn&#x27;t overly concerned. Every now and then a sharp pain would cause me to adjust my legs purely out of reflex. The pain woke me up a couple times during the night, but I was able to fall back asleep. The morning came with considerably less pain, but still extremely raw skin in that relatively small area. Alas, the extremely raw skin had no hair (at least in most places - there are still small areas where the hair stayed strong, though cleaning them up won&#x27;t be difficult). I will not be using this product in my upper inner thighs anymore. You can be sure of that. However, to be fair, there were plenty of other areas I applied the cream that had no pain and all gain... or loss... of hair, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely works. But in some areas, it most certainly hurts. Be warned. I&#x27;ll update if anything changes, but I expect the pain and redness to completely go away after a couple days.nd aloe vera.

    <li> No burning, no itching, no more hair.  And the website is hilarious.  Go visit.  Your usage may vary, but I&#x27;ve used other stuff that burned.</li>
    <li> If your grow hair in places that you don&#x27;t want  it to and you want a satisfied partner then this product for you! It removes hair in those private places as well as your back! It can cause a little sensitivity but the balm calms things down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say it feels good going on!</li>
    <li> Does not work very well, at least for me. Had to leave it on past the recommended time to get any hair removal. Then, after a few hours the skin reaction was quite a surprise. Also, the buffing glove seems to aggravate more than help, even if use very gently. Tried it with no glove, just using my hand and it seemed to be better afterwards. If you have coarse or heavy hair, I would not recommend this product. If you have trimmed hair, this may not work well. It seemed to work best on longer hair, not closely trimmed hair. Why don&#x27;t manufacturers offer a &amp;#34;trial size&amp;#34; kit so consumers would be able to try the item prior to ordering a full size kit? Just a thought.</li>
    <li> This product does not remove hair very well, I&#x27;d recommend using the Nair branded hair removal cream, much better in my opinion. This product did burn a little in a private region of my body, even though it says you can use it there, luckily I removed it when I started to feel a tingling sensation. Just don&#x27;t even try this product, the cream itself is very thick and smells weird as well.</li>
    <li> Turned my scrotum into a catchers mitt it was so raw after following the directions and buffing softly. Took the hair off my most of the skin too.</li>
    <li> Worked in some areas better than others but removed most of the hairs that I needed off.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t hurt when you put it on which is why I really like it.  It removes most if not all the hair around my hairy arse.  After reading many reviews about hair removing cream, this one seemed to be the best.  After using it, I can say I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This product worked...sort of. It applied as advertisrd but for me it didn&#x27;t remove the hair as well as I had hoped. The hair began to come back in within two days. I reapplied the product as per the instructions to areas of re-growth and it burned my skin. This may have been due to the sensitivity of my skin as much as the product. That said, it didn&#x27;t work as well as I wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;burned my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried almost all hair removal products on the market but none rivals Bare Balls.....it is the best. I experience no discomfort following the instructions. I have had very bad experiences from other products such as skin irritation, bruised skin exposure, itching and quick growth. I use Bare Balls on delicate areas of my body with full confidence and comfort. Try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t a problem with irritation, as I had little to no irritation with this product.  The problem was, it removed zero hair under the surface of the skin.  Much like most other products on the market, it simply burned off the part of the hair that it touched, which makes it pretty much as effective as shaving.  I could see hair at the skin level immediately after use, and I had serious stubble the very next day.  The product was a complete waste of money for me.  To be fair, not every product works for everyone, but also to be fair, realize there are a rash of products sold online that pay people to give them positive reviews, so I don&#x27;t know where this one fits.  Could be either way.  On a side note, it looks like this company is run out of someone&#x27;s basement.  It came in a Ziploc bag, and the instructions were photocopied.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  They were actually photocopied.  Couldn&#x27;t afford printing costs for real brochures, I guess.  The glove is pretty lame too.  Looks like something a five year old lost on his way to kindergarten...in 1962.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Finally a hair removal product that works.  No burning as long as you follow instructions!  Don&#x27;t leave on to long!  Will be a return customer as long as the product is available.  Works anywhere and don&#x27;t be shy.</li>
    <li> If I cold give this negative stars I would! Absolutely a waste of money and time. I had no issues with burning or sensitive skin. It&#x27;s just that the product doesn&#x27;t work well. I used the product three days in a row and each time all it did was remove a small random patch of hair at a time. It looked like someone came at me with a lighter. Finally I gave up after the third day and used a razor! Wish I could get my money back :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(also i started with 15 mins the first time, and increased it 2-5 mins each time, no success)</li>
    <li> This does the trick. It works great and seems less harsh than Nair, even in sensitive spots. You feel super smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course there is a chemical smell when using but what do you expect when you&#x27;re nuking hair off your body - the smell washes off as easily as the Ball Balm. Sure beats shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend likes using this too. Hey, I&#x27;m not going to argue there.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on a recommendation by a friend. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t order the single pack online - Amazon said they couldn&#x27;t deliver it to my zip code. But they could deliver the two-pack? So I spent more money than I wanted. Delivery speed was ok - took about a week. I followed the directions for sensitive skin. It didn&#x27;t really remove that much hair, and for the next 3-4 days I was in a LOT of pain due to the burns it caused. The next morning I was almost in tears when some fabric became stuck to the burned skin. The Calm Balm didn&#x27;t really do much to help with the irritation/pain/burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. Not a good deal. No satisfaction guarantee - probably for a good reason</li>
    <li> Much better than the alternatives.  I like the company that makes this and the packaging is great.  Will buy again when I run out.  This stuff goes a LONG way!</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews I had to give the ball cream a chance. I was a little worried about skin irritation since I have weird skin.  I was a little hairier than normal so I also wondered if I would have to do it twice. I put the cream on and was checking my fantasy football score. I lost track of time and ended up leaving it on for longer than I intended probably about 12 minutes. I got in the shower and the hair came right off. I was surprised that there was not much of a chemical smell but the best part for me is that the hair doesn&#x27;t itch when growing back. I have used this a few times and have just ordered some more. I won&#x27;t ever go back to a razor. This cream saves me time and is a whole lot easier.</li>
    <li> Removed skin from scrotum causing uncontrolled bleeding from genitals.  Would not stop until I went to ER.  Very embarrassing, and incredibly painful.</li>
    <li> got this for someone else but it really helps remove all hair, not too harsh</li>
    <li> Hey just wanted to know if this stuff takes care of the hair on the lower back also ( the buns)</li>
    <li> Bought based on reviews as a skeptic.  Wow this stuff works great!  No stinging or bad smell!!!  Even on the most sensitive areas it&#x27;s fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I have used ballsBALM 5 or 6 times.  The first time was a little rough, left the product on a little too long.  Now I have the hang of things and it works well.  If it has been a while, sometimes I need to apply a second coat.  Smell is not bad, hardly noticeable for me.  Best hair removal product I have used.</li>
    <li> worked fine  but you do have to be carefull it does burn a bit.</li>
    <li> Not for me. I followed the directions and still felt burnt. may have just been my skin, idk.</li>
    <li> Minor irritation for about a day but the cream helps alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to extent the time to remove everything.</li>
    <li> Used on the more manageable regions, Balls Balm produces results similar to a razor with only slightly less irritation. The salve is a nice touch and definitely helps when applied often. But where it stands out is on the locations too delicate for sharp objects. Hair is removed cleanly and effectively. There is no burn and the cream smells delicious. The tongue depressors do a fine job for application but I&#x27;ve since just been using my hands. A washcloth or loofah does the job of the glove with better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect on hard to reach areas&lt;br /&gt;- Gets the job done with only a thin coating; efficient&lt;br /&gt;- Terrific smell&lt;br /&gt;- Minimal irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Tongue depressors and glove are cheap and unnecessary&lt;br /&gt;- Average results on easy to reach areas&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging could use some improvement</li>
    <li> The boys are clean like 2 Lima beans</li>
    <li> but after three attempts, I can still feel the burn, and pain while attempting to sleep&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is that even if overexposed on the nuts, it wasnt able to remove all the hair, but remainder will be used on other body parts, which have felt no burn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend buying a good shaver, from what I can tell, you stay smooth for same amount of time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an alternative to shaving and a friend referred this product. This is very easy to apply. It&#x27;s more fun when you a friend do it for you. Then the hair comes off in the shower with the handy glove. The balm is bonus and very soothing. This is an excellent product</li>
    <li> I read all the good and bad reviews before I ordered, so I knew this might not be a great experience, but I gave it a try anyway. I followed the instructions, except that they didn&#x27;t send me any sticks, so I had to apply with my finger. I put a generous amount of the stuff on the areas I wanted hairless, and started keeping time from when the first dab went on. After a few minutes it occurred to me that a hairless buttcrack might be nice, making that whole situation easier to clean, so I slathered up back there too.  The butt hair started falling out almost right away. The ball hair, not so much. I kept checking like the instructions said, but nothing. So when I hit the time limit, I wiped off the goo with the glove provided, and then washed with soap in the shower, and that&#x27;s when it all started to sting. It wasn&#x27;t horrible, but it wasn&#x27;t very pleasant. And none of the pubic hair came off.  Once I was all clean, I dried off and put a bunch of the &#x27;soothing salve&#x27; or whatever it&#x27;s called on all the treated areas -- I put on a lot, probably too much in the buttcrack. About fifteen minutes later I went to wipe some of the excess out of the buttcrack and I could feel stubble. I have a stubbly ass crack now. And my nuts are hairy and sore. I expect they&#x27;ll feel fine in a day or two, but since the purpose of this stuff is to remove hair, not to cause mild to moderate burning that heals within a few days, the fact that I didn&#x27;t burn a hole in my scrotum like some of the reviewers did is kind of beside the point.  Funny thing -- by balls seemed to really shrink up when I put the stuff on, like they knew it was gonna be bad. Shoulda listened to deez nuts.</li>
    <li> Maybe I left it on for an extra minute but OUCH!!!  A fair amount of burning...took a week or two to heal completely....on top of that very little hair actually came off.</li>
    <li> Not effective. Burning sensation when used</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply amazing. Works great and you don&#x27;t even need to use that much.</li>
    <li> Yea it works I guess. If you like burn. I have done this with multiple products and everytime I regret it. Stick to a trimmer.</li>
    <li> My experience:&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great for the thinner softer hair on your balls.  It did leave the hair of the surrounding region more of a 4 day length stubble.  I attribute it to hair thickness. Think about an ice cube being melted. if you have one giant chunk of ice it will melt slower than if you had several chips of ice.  It&#x27;s the same for this product.  It needs more time to get the thicker hair, BUT DON&#x27;T ADD TIME TO ALLOW THIS.  Your skin will give out before the hair does and you will hate your life for days to come.  Just follow the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have razor burn that was healing (well I thought it was healed, I was wrong) and had chemical burns on the area above your junk.  I used their cream and it relieves right away for about 20 seconds (cold on hot, makes sense), then the burning comes back BUT then slowly it goes away (2 minutes or more?) I can&#x27;t quantify the time because you just simply forget about the burning feeling.  On the pain scale it&#x27;s a 2/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason for star count:&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this a 4/5 since it is balls balm after all. and it did do what it was meant to do, my balls are smooth.  However I took it down a notch because not all ball hair is created equal.  If you have thicker ball hair this may not be the right product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product for my scrotum.  I recommend this this product, for junk area only use.  The &amp;#34;Bikini&amp;#34; area it is pretty much useless for me.  Guess I&#x27;ll just have to shave? wax?  I&#x27;ll figure it out.</li>
    <li> First off, this is a great product.  It is the only hair removal cream that doesn&#x27;t smell foul, or harm the goods.  I keep buying it because it does exactly what it says with minimal drama and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only rate it 4 stars because the name of the product is clearly on the return label.  After a slightly awkward conversation with my mailman (we joke about how often he&#x27;s at my house with deliveries), I have now become &amp;#34;the guy with the smooth stones.&amp;#34;  I know the company name is fun and creative, but some type of pseudonym or separate shipping name would have prevented this awkward exchange.</li>
    <li> ballsBALM is great even for my sensitive skin.  It does a really good job of removing unwanted body hair from \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas on the body with minimal skin irritation.  I was also really surprised and impressed with the included moisturizer/calming cream...it really seemed to soothe the area and moisturize without any weird fragrance added.  Overall a really good product, mainly because it does the job without overly irritating.  Will definitely be a returning customer.</li>
    <li> Balls balm is an extremely fast and easy product for body hair removal. I&#x27;ve used it pretty much everywhere :O and it removes hair with no problem at all. Follow the instructions included and you&#x27;ll never have any problems. Afterwards, your skin may be a bit sensitive, but the Calm Balm included soothes extremely well. This is a great product.. and as an added bonus, it smells a little like play-doh.</li>
    <li> this is my second time order. I followed directions and worked great!&lt;br /&gt;Now, since I know its not an issue, I leave it on for max time, 10min I think and works even better. Just wish I could buy the balm separately.&lt;br /&gt;For the few items on the market, coughNaircough, this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Pretty simple review - this stuff works as advertised, no hastle.  Repeat purchaser that is satisfied with what I get every time.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t work for me. I read the instructions and it didn&#x27;t remove a single hair. But it does say it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, so it&#x27;s understandable.</li>
    <li> Too sensitive skin that is why I gave it one star, might work for some but for me burns too much</li>
    <li> Even when used as in compliance with the directions this product still causes serious burns. Avoid this product at all cost</li>
</ol>
