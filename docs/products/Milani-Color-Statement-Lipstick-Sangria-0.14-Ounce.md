<li> I bought my lipstick from cvs for about $6.00.It is dry but that&#x27;s why you put lipgloss over after lipstick</li>

<li> Also the giant sticker the seller stuck on it made it hard to open and left a sticky substance on the tube that sticks to my hand any time I use it.</li>

    <li> i love this color a lot</li>
    <li> Lipstick is dry and not moist and smooth on application. It almost feels grainy.  Wth the first use, the bottom twist cap came off in my hand and was connected only by a hairs width of a glue strand.  I would not buy it again as a personal choice.</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely stunning. The lipstick smells good too. Very satisfied.</li>

    <li> This is a great color that I discoverd accidently! Especially when paired off with Milani 3D Glitzy Glamour Gloss in \\&quot;Fashion Diva\\&quot;... Does not have much staying power alone though... I&#x27;m a Baltimore Raven&#x27;s Fan and this combination compliments my NFL Gear like no other. Purple Power!!!</li>
    <li> Colour gorgeous ! And I love the smell of this lipstick.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick, I get a lot of compliments on how pretty the color is, love it ....</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, makes lips look full. Inexpensive while still achieving quality, like the more expensive lipsticks. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Even texture and only requires one reapplication per day after about 8-9 hours. No bleeding for a long while after application either which is great, plus it kinda smells like raspberries :)</li>
    <li> Too dry color fades Quick not good wish if was better quality And too much found it at walgreens For $$4.47</li>
    <li> I love this colour, it is a bit dry as most persons have said but I don&#x27;t have that issue as I always use a lip balm before applying any lipstick. The colour is gorgeous on my complexion (I&#x27;m dark brown) the colour is also long lasting. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Love it, creamy and smooth application</li>
    <li> Love all these lipsticks in this line. Wide variety of colors and finishes. I prefer the matte. They are matte without being drying or sinking into my lines. The color payoff is amazing. Along with the smell! Just like watermelon jolly ranchers. They are much cheaper at the drugstore, I get mine at Walgreens. But $10 is still a steal, I&#x27;d pay double!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this color! I think it is a great berry shade for dark skin. It is a dry but I wouldn&#x27;t call it matte. To me, the quality and staying power of this lipstick is good for being a drugstore brand. You&#x27;re better off buying this lipstick at the drugstore or Target, it&#x27;s cheaper. I actually had to wait for this lipstick to restock at my local drugstore and I snatched up the last one!</li>
    <li> Terrible. Just terrible. It doesn&#x27;t go on well and leaves a sticky consistency. I own a lot of matte lipsticks and I never have this issue. Also the giant sticker the seller stuck on it made it hard to open and left a sticky substance on the tube that sticks to my hand any time I use it. I wish this was returnable because I&#x27;m never going to use it again.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is such a beautiful plum color that is perfect for fall. What&#x27;s great about this product is its true to color. The color on the bottom of the package is the same color you get on your lips. I tested this product out for 2 weeks and was pleasantly surprised when I only had to reapply after eating or drinking.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is a little more pink than I expected but I like the color well enough and it&#x27;s got a good scent.</li>
    <li> This color is bold and looks amazing. I am very please. I was surprised to learn that it is 4.00 cheaper at CVS.</li>
