### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been happy with the performance.</li>
      <li>Price was great, so I am settling on 3 stars.</li>
      <li>Noting comes out if you hold it upside-down without squeezing, which is good, and when you squeeze the bottles</li>
      <li>The smallest bottle(10ml) is a good size for keeping in a pocket.</li>
      <li>Love them!</li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;cap incident&amp;#34; these were just OK.  </li>
      <li>and I felt folks should know there is a chance they wont be able to use the 30ml bottles included in the set.</li>
      <li>, so customer service was no hassle &amp; I am pleased with the way it was handled.</li>
      <li>They cheerfully refunded my money, however, which was nice.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to get one drop at a time.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>The 10ml and 20ml are perfectly fine.</li>
      <li>The 10 and 20 ml bottles work fine and have no problems.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very impressed with the quality of these little containers.</li>
      <li>and so overall I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
      <li>I am repackaging liquids for travelling, and do not feel comfortable with using these without putting in a ziplock.</li>
      <li>Cheaply made literally fall apart when using them</li>
      <li>The caps fit well but don&#x27;t seem bulletproof.</li>
      <li>These bottles are cheap and hold the liquid you put in them.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re made cheaply.</li>
      <li>application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lids barely fit and the drippers cracked in some way causing leaking.</li>
      <li>I have been happy with the small and medium size bottles, but there needs to be better quality control from the manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>I recently ordered these based on good customer reviews.  </li>
      <li>These are pretty crappy,  some of the lids don&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>These small plastic bottles are the ideal way to have liquids with you for some camping comfort or even spicing up a meal.</li>
      <li>The three large caps didn&#x27;t quite fit any of the bottles, thus 1/3 of these bottles were rendered</li>
      <li>But like I said, I got a refund right away</li>
      <li>They have very strong lids and the three different sized are very convenient.</li>
      <li>The first one is the dropper cap.  </li>
      <li>The caps screw off and have a tamper-ring that comes off when unscrewed for the first time.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, I did contact the seller</li>
      <li>it, I&#x27;ll just throw the lids in the bag.&amp;#34; Well that should have been their first clue.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother you might have better luck at your local dollar store.</li>
      <li>The larger ones did not have fitting tips or caps.</li>
      <li>Needed these to complete my emergency bag (I live in Mexico City).  </li>
      <li>Theses bottles let you leave the large containers at home and still have what you want with you but in a smaller ( Lighter ) amount for the camping trip.</li>
      <li>Smaller than I thought they were and does not seal very well.</li>
      <li>I tried to get them on there upside down, right side up, every which way imaginable.</li>
      <li>Even when the bag gets crushed, or I drop it, or drop something on it, the little bottles hold up just fine.</li>
      <li>Your imagination is the only drawback to what they can be used for , I like some liquid biodegradable soap , Louisiana Hot Sauce ,  Olive Oil , Hand Sanitizer and other items.</li>
      <li>I would strongly advise against the purchase of this poorly made product.</li>

<li> The tips are not secure and the caps will not even go on.  </li>
<li> The seal between the bottle and the cap is so poor that it led me to believe that the caps were manufactured for a different bottle.  </li>
<li> Bottle were pretty bad for any</li>
<li> and I was given a refund because they were not able to send me the pieces I was missing</li>
<li> /&gt;The 30ml bottle on the other hand are not good.  </li>
<li> contact Amazon customer support to ask them if they could arrange to contact the seller to send me replacement (small) caps, but they were not able to this this.</li>
<li> To fill the bottle you have to pull off the dropper tip, which wasn&#x27;t too hard to do with just my fingernail.</li>
<li> The plastic is also a little on the thin side.  </li>
<li> Very poor quality.  </li>
<li> Terrible waste of time and money.</li>
<li> This is practically a scam these are so bad.</li>

    <li> Cheaply made literally fall apart when using them ( the tips fall off and dump whatevers in them all over the place)</li>
    <li> The 10 and 20 ml bottles work fine and have no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 30ml bottle on the other hand are not good.  The tips are not secure and the caps will not even go on.  When you try and put on the caps for the 30ml bottle while it has the tip on, the tip will get stuck inside the cap and be pulled off when you remove the it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Well after filling the 10 and 20 ml bottles and trying to use them, I have found that almost all of them leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a waste of money and should be avoided.</li>
    <li> These bottles are cheap and hold the liquid you put in them.  There are two caps for the bottles.  The first one is the dropper cap.  You remove it to fill the bottle and keep it on the bottle at other times.  It is what allows the liquids to be dispensed in drop form.  The second cap is the white one used to keep the dropper cap protected and keep the liquid in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dropper cap leaks.  When I turn the bottle over and dispense a few drops, additional liquid squirts out the side between the dropper cap and the bottle.  There is a defect in the bottle and I&#x27;ve had this problem on the two that I&#x27;ve tried.  The third one does not have this problem.</li>
    <li> Product as describe! Love them!</li>
    <li> These small plastic bottles are the ideal way to have liquids with you for some camping comfort or even spicing up a meal. Your imagination is the only drawback to what they can be used for , I like some liquid biodegradable soap , Louisiana Hot Sauce ,  Olive Oil , Hand Sanitizer and other items. Theses bottles let you leave the large containers at home and still have what you want with you but in a smaller ( Lighter ) amount for the camping trip.</li>
    <li> Terrible waste of time and money. The large bottles came with the wrong caps (wrong thread pitch) and all of the bottles leak unless you tighten them exactly the correct amount. This is practically a scam these are so bad.</li>
    <li> Only used one but I&#x27;ve been happy with the performance. Some if the extra plastic from the mold Cn leave a sharp edge if you don&#x27;t trim them down well.</li>
    <li> This set came with three different sized bottles, all of which have the same sized cap threads. However, there were six small caps and three larger caps shipped with the product.  The three large caps didn&#x27;t quite fit any of the bottles, thus 1/3 of these bottles were rendered useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contact Amazon customer support to ask them if they could arrange to contact the seller to send me replacement (small) caps, but they were not able to this this. They cheerfully refunded my money, however, which was nice.  Would have been nicer to have all the bottles I ordered be useable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the &amp;#34;cap incident&amp;#34; these were just OK.  The caps fit well but don&#x27;t seem bulletproof. I am repackaging liquids for travelling, and do not feel comfortable with using these without putting in a ziplock. The plastic is also a little on the thin side.  Price was great, so I am settling on 3 stars.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I did contact the seller and I was given a refund because they were not able to send me the pieces I was missing, so customer service was no hassle &amp; I am pleased with the way it was handled. It gets 3 starts as a item because its still being offered and I felt folks should know there is a chance they wont be able to use the 30ml bottles included in the set. The 10ml and 20ml are perfectly fine. No issues. But the lids that were thrown in to the bag, unattached to the 30ml bottle, do not fit. It was actually almost as if whoever was bagging the set got to the 30ml ones and couldn&#x27;t get the lid on and just went &amp;#34;screw it, I&#x27;ll just throw the lids in the bag.&amp;#34; Well that should have been their first clue. I tried to get them on there upside down, right side up, every which way imaginable. they simply weren&#x27;t compatible with that bottle. But like I said, I got a refund right away and so overall I&#x27;m a happy camper. Just be advised of this when purchasing.</li>
    <li> Needed these to complete my emergency bag (I live in Mexico City).  They have Bleach, Hydrogen Peroxide, and Rubbing Alcohol in them!</li>
    <li> No leaks.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered these based on good customer reviews.  However, I ended up with nipples and caps that did not fit most of the larger bottles, and were, thus, useless.  I have been happy with the small and medium size bottles, but there needs to be better quality control from the manufacturer.  This was NOT an issue with Amazon, just the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I got Three bottles of each size. The smallest bottle(10ml) is a good size for keeping in a pocket. The caps screw off and have a tamper-ring that comes off when unscrewed for the first time. To fill the bottle you have to pull off the dropper tip, which wasn&#x27;t too hard to do with just my fingernail. Noting comes out if you hold it upside-down without squeezing, which is good, and when you squeeze the bottles it&#x27;s easy to get one drop at a time. The only thing I didn&#x27;t understand is the little blue key-chain thing that comes with them. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a tool for anything.</li>
    <li> These are pretty crappy,  some of the lids don&#x27;t fit. some of the bottles don&#x27;t even have openings where they should. Keep looking.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought they were and does not seal very well.</li>
    <li> instead of 9 each I waited a very long long time and got about 20 each size</li>
    <li> The larger ones did not have fitting tips or caps. They&#x27;re made cheaply. Don&#x27;t bother you might have better luck at your local dollar store.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the quality of these little containers. They don&#x27;t leak, at all. They have very strong lids and the three different sized are very convenient. I use them for gun oil and solvent in my range bag. Even when the bag gets crushed, or I drop it, or drop something on it, the little bottles hold up just fine.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality.  Seven of the nine bottles leaked from the outset.  The seal between the bottle and the cap is so poor that it led me to believe that the caps were manufactured for a different bottle.  I would strongly advise against the purchase of this poorly made product.</li>
    <li> Bottle were pretty bad for any application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lids barely fit and the drippers cracked in some way causing leaking.</li>
