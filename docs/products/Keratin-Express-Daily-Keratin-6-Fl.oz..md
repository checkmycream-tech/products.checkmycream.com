    <li> I abolutely loved this product! I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different so I can only speak for mine. I will never be without this Keratin Express treatment again ever! I&#x27;m african american and growing out my relaxer. I would never be able to do it with the keratin. It keeps my hair from breaking due to the stress of the relaxer growing out...I purchased the 16oz. bottle just because I know I will probably use it for life and its a better buy. My hair was so shiny, silky, and smooth...I got so many compliments it was amazing!!! I use it about every 5-6 weeks. My hair drys quickly, less split ends, and very managable!!</li>
    <li> This product is so amazing. I used to hate summers because I have natural curly hair and it would get really frizzy when it gets humid which is almost all the time in Minnesota. Keratin Express Daily Keratin has made my hair soft and so manageable. I can enjoy the summer again. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product at my hairdresser&#x27;s and found this product controls my frizzys, better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My daughter has mixed hair and is always looking for that perfect product so that she doesn&#x27;t have to chemically straighten her hair.  This product is great!  After putting it on she was able to run her fingers through her hair and it straightened with the flat iron beautifully.  The only draw back is that it only lasted two days.  My daughter usually washes her hair every three days and she had to restraighten her hair on the second morning.</li>
    <li> Perfect blow out everytime! Curly hair stays straight for days.  I love this proudcut, I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> Works just as described.  Left my hair soft and manageable, easy to apply and dries with no residue.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> If you have Keratin Complex straightened hair this product is excellent.  Pair it with their shampoo and conditioner and you have a system to stretch the time you need to re-straighten your hair. One word of advise, follow the directions on the container do not use more than the recommended amount applied to hair otherwise your styled hair will be stringy.</li>
    <li> First time using it tonight. I have mixed hair. I as able to blow dry and flat iron in 1 hour!</li>

    <li> Great product Thank You I called Keratin in regards to the package and product and yes they did change it and it is still a great product</li>
