<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> best product, &amp; great price!</li>
    <li> I could not find this product in any local store even though it is a new product.  I have short hair and this lets me mold it to the way I want it to look.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this, I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever and I couldn&#x27;t find it at stores any more .........lucky I found it on-line.  It&#x27;s just the right amount of &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; in volume without making your hair feel &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I was so disapointed when it disappeared from local store shelves.  Nothing else works as well for my thin fine hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this root booster! It is the only product I have found that holds. I wish they had not discontinued this product.</li>
    <li> Love this; can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple years and all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find it at any store, so I was thrilled to find it once again. It&#x27;s the only root lifter which has ever made my hair look really good without looking stiff.  It even adds additional shine.  It appears Garnier has decided to stop making this product so I bought, what I think, is enough to last me for awhile. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll use when it is gone forever.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for your hair.  Works great on my fine hair.  Gives it great Body!</li>
    <li> Could no longer find this product in any store. I searched  high &amp; low. My hair is thin &amp; fine so was I ever glad that my amazing AMAZON came thru for me. This product really gives my limp hair a great BOOST UP!</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted and expected.</li>
    <li> Love this product, doesn&#x27;t stiffen your hair as much as other hairspray or gels.</li>
    <li> I cannot imagine life without this product. It gives my hair body without stiffness. I spray it on my roots and then blow dry. I have very fine hair that is limp and hard to control...but this product works wonders.</li>
    <li> This is a great root lifter and volumizer. I have very thin baby fine hair this gives me the body and lift to make my hair look full. It adds thickness to hair. I put it all over not just on the roots. It is not stiff like other products. I apply to my roots and all over my damp hair and blow dry upside down. The fullness is amazing. I can not believe they are discontinuing this item!! It seems Garnier only wants to sell products for people with frizzy full hair and doesn&#x27;t realize there is another whole market of people that have thin hair. I am buying another 6 pkg today to keep a stock pile since you won&#x27;t be able to get it soon. Bad marketing idea on Garnier part. I&#x27;d love to show them a before and after picture. They never advertised this on TV. Just those young girls with a head of fizzy thick hair. Oh, well...</li>
    <li> sshh, you don&#x27;t want this go away, I&#x27;ll take your bottles.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I use with Hot rollers and curl last all day.  It is difficult to find so I was so happy to see it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Best root lifter I have ever used.  Have been using it for more than two years.  Stores are always sold out so it was great to find it at amazon especially six bottles.  Received quickly and it was the exact product I wanted so I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great Bargain, Excellent Product</li>
    <li> I cannot find this product here in Ocala, FL so I ordered it on line.  Great product, does not weigh on your hair, I have very fine and thin hair and the root booster help give me the volume that I am missing.  It leaves your hair nice, no sticky or heavy feeling.  Been using this product for over a year now, and I really do love it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is alcohol free, which is nearly impossible to find in any styling product, expecially a root volumizer.  It works great and there isn&#x27;t a a sticky or greasy buildup.  It does not leave a heavy residue and washes out with ease.  The scent is very light and doesn&#x27;t compete with other products-not overpowering.  It is free of harsh sulfates, so it won&#x27;t strip the color from your hair.  It is loaded with natural ingredients and works without damaging your hair.  It gives nice body, and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling coated with product. It is difficult to find in stores now-what a shame!  It is very low cost-I have paid 5x this much for a single bottle of a similar salon product, without getting the same results. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried many root lifter products.  Garnier root lifter is the only one that helps my hair look fuller and it holds the lift.  After using it for a while I could no longer find it in any store in my area.  I was so happy to find it online.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! The price was good too.  I would recommend this to all. Using my first bottle and hope I can find more when the others are done.</li>
    <li> Love this product. So sorry it is no longer available.</li>
    <li> Love it.Used for a long time. Just enough hold without stiffness</li>
    <li> Used this product previously. Love it. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere but at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is the absolute best for my fine hair.  Even though Garnier Fructis has discontinued it, I&#x27;m very glad to have found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time to purchase a case of 6.  Haven&#x27;t found another product that works as well for me.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hair styling aid.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for quite some time and am extremely pleased with how it makes my hair look.</li>
    <li> This item was just as advertised, quick delivery and great price. Would order from them again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Its the ONLY product that gives my thin fine hair a boost! I&#x27;m  hoping that you will keep it in stock for a LONG while!</li>
    <li> Great product-great price-quick shipping</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, gives lift to my limp hair.  6 Bottle deal, set for life!</li>
    <li> It is my favorite styling product and I&#x27;m thrilled I can still find it!</li>
    <li> This has been a great product for me.  I cannot find it in stores anymore, so I looked on Amazon.  I surely hope it is not being discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products and this one is the best, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is the only root booster that works for me.  I love this stuff and I am so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife, since the stores around here quit carrying it. I guess it works since she&#x27;s a retired hairdresser and it&#x27;s what she uses.</li>
    <li> So sorry this product was discontinued - it is the only product that works on my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT for  fine thin hair, it gives your hair an extra boost that I have not found in any other product on the market. It&#x27;s a shame that they discontinued to carry it in stores across the country.&lt;br /&gt;A. Andrews</li>
    <li> Why Garnier discontinued this product I cannot imagine.  For fine and difficult hair,  it is the best I have found. I keep enough on hand to use each shampoo.</li>
    <li> Will order again..ThAnx so much</li>
    <li> Received but 4 of the 6 bottle sprays are broken.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore so glad to be able to buy on line.  It does the job and isn&#x27;t sticky like some other similar products.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this---- great product</li>
    <li> Adds body to my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Always works for me.  I have a lot of hair but it is fine.  It always gives my hair lift; mousse never works for my hair.  Garnier Fructis Style Root Booster Hi-Rise Lift is good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have no clue why Garnier stopped making this product, it was the best on the market....EVER.  I noticed others feel the same way, when you have something good why get rid of it.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do when I run out of this product??  Its going to be a sad day.  I am a product junky and nothing comes close to this...nothing.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this product helps better than any product I have found.  I was thrilled when I found this product online because you can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Received it quickly.  I love this product and I can&#x27;t buy it anywhere but online.  Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I am so glad Amazon had it.</li>
    <li> Good hair care.  For me it works great, just sad that Garnier doesn&#x27;t make it any longer, or I can&#x27;t seem to find it in So Illinois.  Packaging was ripped open and and one of the bottles, the top was broken.  It was in a card board envelope and didn&#x27;t have much protection.  Should have been in a box.  I received it in fast mailing.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for fine thin hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. Recently I have been unable to find it in the stores, so I bought a bunch here to last me for a while before they inevitably discontinue this. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this product. It gives control and lift where you need it!</li>
    <li> Glad I could get this since it&#x27;s discontinued!</li>
    <li> Great product...can&#x27;t believe they stopped making...nothing else compares...my wife now has a couple year supply...it&#x27;s the only thing that give her hair the hold and volume she wants.</li>
    <li> I  used this product and was unable to find it @ my local Wal Mart  or Walgreens as they no longer carry it. I found this on your site and ordered a supply for myself. It is a great product and for short hair it is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again was so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best hair product for my hair. It is soft and fine and needs something that is light but holds my hair in place</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have been using Garnier Fructis Root Booster for many years now.  I can&#x27;t imagine being without it.  It does just as it advertises. It gives my hair that extra lift yet let my hair look and feel so natural. I have not been able to find the product in my local Wal-mart, Walgreen&#x27;s, etc...so I was extremely pleased to purchase it online.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s better then anything else I&#x27;ve tried for volume.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years, works well with my fine hair. Glad to find it.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product for people with thin, limp fine hair.  People cannot believe that my hair actually is as thin as it is because this product makes it look thick</li>
    <li> I purchased the Garnier Fructis Style Root Booster to replace the Suave Volumizing Root Boost Spray since it&#x27;s not available any more.  So far, the Suave product is preferred and I am bewildered as to why Suave took that product off the market.</li>
    <li> It lasts about 3 hours in my hair, I am looking for all day hold. It is not stiff and brushes out easily</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping.  I love this product sorry Garnier stopped producing it.  I need to make every drop count.</li>
    <li> After scoffing at a friend who shared that root lifter was the secret of her incredible hair, I found this stuff and have used it for 8 years straight. I was relieved to read all the other reviews of loyalists&#x27; saddened at the product being discontinued. I tried at least five or six other brands, from drugstore to high-end salon brands and none of them came close. I have an A-line bob but pretty thin hair that&#x27;s usually stuck flat to my head. I just ordered a year and a half&#x27;s supply. It&#x27;s green magic in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years.  I have very fine hair and it does give some fullness and body to my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and the stores quit carrying it.  So happy to hear you had it!  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is by far the best root booster that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have fine thin hair and after reading the reviews decided to try it. It&#x27;s WONDERFUL! I have ordered before and so I stocked up.</li>
