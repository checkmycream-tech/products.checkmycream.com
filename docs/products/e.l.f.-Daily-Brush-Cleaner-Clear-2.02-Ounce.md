<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well but the smell is nauseating</li>
    <li> Smells nasty and doesn&#x27;t work. It makes your brushes smell disgusting and it doesn&#x27;t even seem to do anything. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses make up  alot and thought it would be good idea to clean them.  But at this time not used it yet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it would do right.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Works very well. Is a very light formula. I spray it on a cloth and then wipe my brushes on the cloth. Smells really great. Great quality for the price. Great for everyday brush upkeep cleaning. Not so good for deep cleaning. For deep cleaning I would recommend soaking brushes in a quality brush cleaning liquid, patting brushes dry, and then finishing off by letting brushes air dry.</li>
    <li> Warm soapy water does a better job. Even just warm water does better. So not worth the money. MAC brush cleaner is hands down worth the extra few bucks. IT WORKS! If you don&#x27;t want to drop the money on MAC then compared to this product, just use warm water. Remember, Believe in the Lord and you will be saved (Acts 16:31-Bible).</li>
    <li> First of all this has a VERY strong fragrance like so strong my whole room smells like perfume it also leaves my brushes with the scent.My second complaint is that every time I spray this it leaks all down the side of the bottle and it&#x27;s annoying. It does an okay job cleaning the brushes. The only good about this is the price $3.00 at target, and that this is a cruelty free brand.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but if you are like me and have a lot of brushes, you can go through a bottle very quickly.  I like the ease of it, but will probably purchase a bigger bottle of another brand next time.</li>
    <li> Cleans brishes very well with out making them soaked for hours. Dries quick and cleans fast.</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IT LEAVES is BEYOND sickening....if your sensitive to smells avoid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sort of sad that this doesn&#x27;t work. I bought a $3.50 bottle of Ulta brush cleaner and even though that product smelled bad, it actually cleaned the brush. I do like the smell of this cleaner, but it&#x27;s like spraying scented water on your brush. The brushes I used this product on was a Sigma F86, F88, and a Sephora eyeshadow brush. I took the brush cleaner, sprayed it on all of the brushes one at a time, and scrubbed them using a dixie cup. With the old cleaner, I could see the product running out of the brushes. This product didn&#x27;t do anything. My tip is to either go for the smell bad Ulta brush cleaner (THAT&#x27;S ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAN THIS) and/or use some dish soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was curious, honestly expecting to see how it would fail me. Well, it hasn&#x27;t! Not only that, but it has amazed me. In fact, I like it so much that I am almost out of it. I find that applying this when the weather is hot really does make the makeup last longer. It even kept my makeup looking great in the dessert. What I particularly like is how this takes away any look of powderiness from your face (I like using mineral foundation in the summer). It has some type of smell that I am not exactly crazy about, but that goes away within seconds. I am definitely repurchasing this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erratum: I&#x27;ve just realized that I posted this review for the wrong product! I was actually referring to the ELF Mist &amp; Set in my review and not to the brush shampoo. Sorry for the confusion!</li>
    <li> I use it every time on a brush after I use it with foundation</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush cleanser! Second time i&#x27;ve purchased it. It works so amazing. Shipping was quick and this product is so worth it. Deff recomend.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, however, after the spraying and cleaning, it leaves my brushes greasy. Some sort of conditioner? Idk. But it comes off later</li>
    <li> I use this spray daily on my brushes on a paper towel and was surprised at how much make up came off! Smells great, works great, drys quickly even if you saturate it. Meaning, I used it in the AM and my brushes were dry for a PM touch up :-) I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
    <li> I got this to keep my makeup brush set clean and sanitary for makeup applications. I am very happy with how well it works, the nice clean smell, and perfect bottle size. It fits right in my makeup case. I would recommend this to a fellow makeup artist and for personal use at home to keep your makeup brushes clean a free from bacteria that can build up over time.</li>
    <li> Two stars because it does clean the brushes a little.  Leaves a lot of product on the brushes.  I will never purchase again.</li>
    <li> works great...smells nice</li>
    <li> Smell is VERY STRONG. But works great</li>
    <li> I use it for work and personal. It works well for in between cleanings when you can&#x27;t use any brush shampoo.</li>
    <li> Does the job at a price one can afford, ships cheap and fast.  No complaints here.  I am using them on e.l.f. brushes, though, which may make a difference.</li>
    <li> I was able to get more filth out of my brushes by using foamy soap from bath and body works than i was from this formula. I think that it was fake and it was just water at the end of the day because it make no difference on any of my brushes. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Literally just alcohol and fragrance in a small spray container. Probably an effective disinfectant if you really saturate the brush. Not positive what the advantage of this is over rubbing alcohol, though.</li>
    <li> Works just as good as sephora daily brush cleaner. I use daily after putting my make up on to keep the bacteria off in between washing them. I like the smell and it does not stay on my brushes.</li>
    <li> Water and mild soap. I&#x27;m not sure if the purpose to this stuff is to clean the brush (get all makeup off) or disinfect.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff doesn&#x27;t an awful job at getting the makeup off if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s meant for. Your brush will go a shade lighter from whatever color you are trying to remove lol.</li>
    <li> Does the job of claning as expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered this ELF brush cleaner and I received a larger bottle of Mary Kay brush cleaner.  Very strange... So I can&#x27;t really review this item, but I must say, I really like the Mary Kay cleaner.  Not sure what&#x27;s going on with this seller, but I got a better value for my money, so I&#x27;m not complaining. ;)</li>
    <li> It does nothing. I spray and spray and spray my eye brushes and scrub and scrub them on the cotton rounds but not much came out. The tip of my brushes are still dirty afterward. I guess it works for black brushes but for white tip or white brushes, you can see that it does nothing.</li>
    <li> I always forget to clean my burshes this will help alot. Arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> I am embarrassed to say that I don&#x27;t think I have EVER cleaned my makeup brushes, and I&#x27;ve had them for at least two to three years. This cleaner got the years of gunk and grossness out of the brushes and now they smell really good and are fresh all over again. Love it!</li>
    <li> After purchasing a nice makeup brush set I thought this would be a &amp;#34;must-have&amp;#34;. This is my first purchase of a make-up brush cleaner. I suppose if I&#x27;m in too much of a hurry this would work, but since the brush has to dry anyway I honestly think it&#x27;s just as easy to wash the brush with Ivory soap and dry.</li>
    <li> It not only has a strong smell but it leaves my brushes feeling even dirtier. I prefer coconut oil and dawn....</li>
    <li> I BROUGHT THIS FOR A PHOTO SHOOT AND THIS WORKED PERFECT. I WILL BUY AGAIN. GREAT PRODUCT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
    <li> It works really well but I wish it didnt have the strong perfume scent.</li>
    <li> The product works ok so far. I bought it at $6 which  is too much overpriced. $10 now? so crazy! The elf website only sells for $3. I am so regret to buy it here. I can&#x27;t return it since I have already opened it. Not recommend it at all. This price is absolutely unfair price. Be aware that</li>
    <li> I have just now started using makeup brushes instead of the little sponges and brushes that come with drugstore makeup. In an attempt to look more like a girl, I ordered myself some E.l.f makeup brushes. I didn&#x27;t want to do it half assed though, so I also purchased the brush cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it! In the past, the only brushes I owned were an eyeshadow brush and a blush brush. I never cleaned them. Shhh... :/ I know that&#x27;s pretty gross, but I didn&#x27;t think about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleaner is super easy to use. It took the nasty make up gunk out of even those original brushes that hadn&#x27;t been clean for years. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (thank God), and it leaves my brushes super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy yourself some brushes, I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Gets sediment out of brushes better than the shampoo..with it was in a bigger bottle though ..by the way I LOOVVEE the smell it has a really nice scent to it</li>
    <li> I use this cleaner everyday on my brushes. It is perfect! Leave my brushes feeling soft and smelling fresh. :-)</li>
    <li> Perfect esp for the price</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this brush cleaner and I think it cleans my brushes nicely.  The price was decent as well.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell.</li>
    <li> Cleans Brushes extremely clean!</li>
    <li> I ordered my new PRO makeup brushes by Andre Lorent (great brushes by the way) at the same time I ordered the brush cleaner. The cleaner arrived today, nearly 4 days later so I was excited to clean my brushes. They did nothing but make my brushes smell good. But they cleaned NOTHING. I thought it was the brushes so I used my liquid hand soap from Bath &amp; Body Works that was on my sink and make up started oozing out and after a few minutes they were clean. Tried the brush cleaner on my blush brush next and nothing, used liquid hand soap and boom...all clean. Guess I&#x27;ll use this cleaner as perfume for my brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean my brush set I purchased. I tested it out on a brush with black eyeliner on it and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This cleaner works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, though based on the reviews I was hoping it would work better.  The smell is very &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34;, which I could do without.  Now every time I use my brushes, they smell like perfume.</li>
    <li> It is a small bottle, but you should expect that judging by the price. It&#x27;s a very nice product that keeps all of my cosmetic brushes feeling clean. It also has an enjoyable scent. It&#x27;s a bit sweet and fresh. Not like you&#x27;re going to wear it as perfume, but it is a pleasant addition to an already very useful product.</li>
    <li> Great product, I recommend this to anyone that wants to clean there brushes fast and effertless</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16yo daughter as a gift. Asking her about it, all she would say is, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s good.&amp;#34;, then she told me that I&#x27;m lame for filling these out... Take that for what it&#x27;s worth. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> The bottle I got could have been filled a little more I feel like but other then that It cleaned my brushes really well</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything to clean my brushes.</li>
    <li> I loooove the scent.. even after spraying on my brush.. later on when I apply the powder or foundation on my face.. the scent comes off as a perfume to the face</li>
    <li> I dont know if this works well. The smell is so strong I can&#x27;t use it. I get migraines so this is not a good choice.</li>
    <li> The box was smashed when i got it. Product wasn&#x27;t harmed. It wasn&#x27;t anything amazing, it does leak a lot though.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim to see if it would work and it was excellent AND it cam 2 days earlier, has free shipping, and smells amazing! How can you deny buying that!</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong item when I ordered this product. I did however keep the item and used it, I am happy to report the Elf product that was sent in its place works well. The item sent in error was a make up spray to keep make-up in place after the make up is applied to keep it from fading. The item was not brush cleaner as indicated.</li>
    <li> Like any brush cleaner, sometimes you have to use a little more than you would like so buy a backup bottle if you&#x27;re working on a project like I did.  Otherwise for home use it&#x27;s great and should last a bit.</li>
    <li> Love it just what I expected the smell is somewhat strong but goes away cleans the brushes perfectly.. If you wear makeup daily you should purchase this</li>
    <li> The smell is pretty bad. But I guess it gets the job done. The brush shampoo is much better though.</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time.  Would recommend this brush cleaner to everyone.  It has a nice fragrance and really cleans your brushes well.</li>
    <li> Great price while it works effectively and efficiently. This is the very first e.l.f. product I ever got and its quality inspires me to try other items of the same brand. I ended up falling in love with their foundation and HD powder!</li>
    <li> Great price, quick delivery &amp; helps keep my make up brushes clean.</li>
    <li> Great for daily washing of my make-up brushes.  I recently bought elf shampoo for cleansing my brushes, only paid $3 for it, and it works great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! When I got it, I used it on a VERY dirty stippling brush, not really expecting it to completely clean it...but it did! Sometimes it takes a little bit of extra scrubbing, but it works great. I just spray it onto my brush and swirl the brush onto a clean towel as I would if I was applying makeup to my face. I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the brush shampoo from elf and I like this a lot more. It&#x27;s easier, and it cleans a lot better. When my brushes really need a DEEP clean, I use the brush shampoo and then I use this after they dry to make sure they are completely clean.</li>
    <li> I used to use Sephora&#x27;s daily brush cleaner spray but thought I would give this a try. It works just as well and is about the same price. The only thing I liked about Sephora&#x27;s daily brush cleaner compared to this one is that it had a milder fragrance. E.l.f.&#x27;s product has a very strong perfume like fragrance to it. Many other reviewers seem to really love the smell of this product and it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like it, I just wish it were a little milder. Luckily it dissipates enough that I don&#x27;t notice it after a little while but for people who are sensitive to fragrances this should be taken into account before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy both products and recommend them to other people looking for a good daily brush cleaner at a cheap price. For me, I guess the only deciding factor will be which one is more convenient to buy since they are just about the same price.</li>
    <li> Got this so I can express clean my brushes after every use. It works very well and its easy and fast clean when I need it.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Cleans thoroughly, dries quickly, smells nice. Definitely worth it. I plan to reorder more when I run out</li>
    <li> Fast and easy way to clean your brushes daily. Recommended!</li>
    <li> This product has a nice scent and helps the brushes dry softer, but it really doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of cleaning my brushes. Rubbing my brushes against a wet cloth actually works better.</li>
    <li> This cleaner comes in handy for cleaning my brushes on a daily basis.  I wash my brushes once a week or so, and this product gives me the peace of mind that they are clean everyday.  Especially the concealer brushes.  I hate to let them get dried out with makeup still on them.  It also helps if you need to use a shadow brush for two different colors.(I have more brushes on the way from e.l.f. thank goodness!)  I highly recommend this product to anyone, makeup artist or average Jane.</li>
    <li> This smells nice. The brushes are soft after I clean them with this. I didn&#x27;t give five stars because this doesnt get the brushes really clean. I read that baby shampoo works better so I will try that in the mean time this is a good product not a great one.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and maintains the cleaness of my face</li>
    <li> Leaves my brushes clean and smelling great!</li>
    <li> works for what I want</li>
    <li> I use this on all my brushes and am SO HAPPY with the results!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like the smell, but it&#x27;s worth keeping just for the fact that even a little amount of it leaves your brushes soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Changed the formula. It is way too perfumed.</li>
    <li> This product is a great bargain, and works for most situations. If you are a MUA (Make-up artist) or use a lot of &#x27;long-lasting&#x27; formulations then you might need something stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;I spray my brush head, and buff the brush into a paper towel or clean white cloth. (I repeat this until the brush is sufficiently clean.) This product does leave a scent, a general &#x27;fresh&#x27; scent. This is a nice way to maintain your brushes in-between wash/shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This product is a good deal, and does the job for most situations.</li>
    <li> this doesn&#x27;t really do much.  Your better off rinsing your brushes in hot water and letting them dry over night.  I don&#x27;t think this cleaned my brushes at all.</li>
    <li> Not a clue why this product has so many great reviews. I feel like it NEVER gets all the way off my brushes and ends up ruining them as well as contaminating my makeup and my skin. I really don&#x27;t like this cleaner and I&#x27;m fully confused as to all the love for this product. I sell cosmetics for a living so I&#x27;m well versed in how to properly clean brushes and this stuff just doesn&#x27;t do the job. Wish it did bc it&#x27;s a great price. But it doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
    <li> I like this! The cleaner smells nice and it does get your brushes nice and clean. They are also soft at the end as well. Plus the price is great compared to other cleaners I&#x27;ve seen. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like it - smell is way too strong, not very effective with removing make up products from brush, hope that its at least really antibacterial</li>
    <li> Aside from the smell, it works well.</li>
    <li> Does a decent job at cleaning my brushes, it&#x27;s nice for daily use which is what it&#x27;s for but for a deeper clean I&#x27;d recommend something else. The smell kind of reminds me of cucumber. Very fresh and clean. It&#x27;s not a very strong smell, but enough to be noticeable. Overall I really like this, it&#x27;s great to use on my brushes after I use them.</li>
    <li> Has a nice, clean scent and did help to clean my brushes. I normally use antibacterial soap and water to clean my brushes each week, but this is an excellent product if you want to do a quick clean in between.  Very good value buy and I normally don&#x27;t love all of Elf&#x27;s products as sometimes cheap&#x3D;cheap.  Very impressed with this.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Not only did it get a TON of makeup out of my brushes, but it smells amazing! I would definitely recommend this product-I haven&#x27;t found an elf product yet that I didn&#x27;t like...and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> You have to use too much to get your brushes clean.</li>
    <li> i didnt like that you need more than 3 or 4 spray to clean all the make-up off the brushes</li>
    <li> Looks like it&#x27;ll work great</li>
    <li> Lightly cleans my brushes when I&#x27;m too lazy to fully cleanse them. But the odor is a bit strong and lingers in the brushes and face.</li>
    <li> This solution works really well. I find that if I use a washcloth the makeup comes off easier than with a paper towel. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Appealing smell.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I bought it for. I have acne prone skin so I try to keep my makeup brushes clean because I don&#x27;t need anything else breaking out my skin</li>
    <li> I have never used a brush cleaner before, but I don&#x27;t think this cleans very well for daily use.  My brushes usually have some residual staining from the product after I use the cleaner.  The brushes don&#x27;t look especially clean the way I expect.  So maybe it&#x27;s just me.  I seem to be using a lot of the cleaner to get my brushes back to their original state.  I&#x27;ll continue using it until it runs out, but will be looking for another product to use in the meantime.</li>
    <li> I suppose maybe this was my fault due to ignorance on what to clean my makeup brushes with but I ended up throwing this away. Scent was way too strong, like I was soaking my brushes in perfume and it made me nervous to put them by my eyes (I have sensitive eyes.) plus the bottle it was in isn&#x27;t too convenient for cleaning. makeup came off as I used it, but jajoba oil or ponds cold cream does the same. Doesn&#x27;t smell like a soap, kinda oily too. miss on this one.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this on Amazon before.. I think a few months ago and the product in this newer bottle smells completely different. I actually like it, though, it&#x27;s a really light, sweet smell, almost like perfume. But I could see how anyone with allergies or sensitive sinuses would not want this, so I thought I would mention it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as functionality goes, this is the best brush cleaner I&#x27;ve used, apart from regular baby shampoo for a deep cleaning every now and then.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s pretty cheap, so I figured it was worth testing it out.  It cleans my brushes well enough- the spray is a pretty fine mist, though, so I found that I had to use a couple of sprays to get enough liquid on my brushes to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars because it smells TERRIBLE to me.  Very, very perfumey and the scent stays on the brushes long after they&#x27;ve dried.  I ended up having to deep clean all of my brushes after using the elf cleaner for a couple of days because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell near my face.</li>
    <li> Worked nicely, but I think it could be better.</li>
    <li> This has been my holy grail brush cleaner for years, and I love it!! Cleans, sanitizes them, and really pro longs the life of my&lt;br /&gt;Brushes!!</li>
    <li> It works, but it&#x27;s primarily alcohol so you&#x27;ll definitely need to condition your brushes more often than usual.  I really only use it regularly on my flat foundation brush.</li>
    <li> Does the job. I use it almost as a daily cleaner for my brushes that way when I do wash them, I don&#x27;t work as hard lol</li>
    <li> My brushes needed a good bath and this was great! I was disgusted how much make up came off my brushes. What I thought was clean, was no where close without this!</li>
    <li> This has a nice clean smell to it and cleans my make-up brushes. I&#x27;d recommend this product. Especially compared to other products with a higher price tag.</li>
    <li> You get so little for the price. Not worth it. Get mac cleaner. Bigger btl with slightly above price but lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it suppose to remove the make-up?! Or just a disinfectanat!? I still have to clean my brushes with soap and water after each use. I like the smeall tho....</li>
    <li> Arrived fast great for my makeup brushes.. great smell..lol</li>
    <li> The cleaner is good. It doesn&#x27;t clean them completely though so I wouldn&#x27;t give it a perfect rating. But again, e.l.f. products are great but you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It seems to work fine. Its not top quality ovbiously byt for the most part it cleans off the brushes inbetween make up changes. Also, it has a pleasnt smell.</li>
    <li> I think this has a wonderful scent. Keeping the bacteria that grows after use of your make-up brushes down to a minimum with a scent that is inviting and pleasant at the same time is something you shouldn&#x27;t do without.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrant brush cleaner for my e.l.f. Makeup brushes!  It is easy to use, just spritz on the brush and wipe the makeup off.  They&#x27;re ready for the next use once dry.</li>
    <li> Received it much earlier than I thought I would. This product cleans my make up brushes very well, especially my cream eye shadow brush. And it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I used to use regular shampoo for my synthetic brushes until i saw this elf daily brush cleaner at Target for $6 bucks i like other elf products so i thought id try it. I went months without cleaning my  brushes and let me tell you they&#x27;re amazing they get all the gunk an old makeup out of the roots to tip and the smell of them the first couple times you apply your makeup after brushes are cleaned is greatly .  Affordable with the name brand effect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a brush cleaner before but this definitely got the job done!</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t used this as yet but the shampoo works fabulous so i bought this to use in between my shampoos so I&#x27;m going to go ahead and say it should work great</li>
    <li> This is a very effective brush cleaner. For the few brushes I use daily, the size is perfect and fits right into my makeup bag. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell.</li>
    <li> First time using a brush cleaner, the smell is not bad, starts out strong but does not bother me and it fades quickly.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT! LOVE IT THE BEST FOR ME..</li>
    <li> I like this brush cleaner and it is easy to use, just spray it on an then rinse the brushes with water. The brushes feel nice after, there is no left over residue.</li>
    <li> I like having this small brush cleanser spray to use on my makeup brushes when I&#x27;m on the go.  However, it takes a LOT of cleanser to get my brushes clean (and I like to keep them rather clean as is).  I had used all of the brush cleaner after only about a month (I have 6 makeup brushes I use consistently).  The cleanser itself doesn&#x27;t seem to be too oily or leave a residue on my brushes, however, it has a very distinct smell- almost floral.  I did not care for this as it gave my brushes the same smell.  I have extremely sensitive skin so I was worried this could cause me to breakout, but it didn&#x27;t.  The brushes just had that sweet distinct smell for a long time after using the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I cannot accept its smell. Besides, it cannot clean the sponge or brush well.</li>
    <li> There is not a type of eye shadow, foundation, or eyeliner that this brush cleaner will not utterly fail to clean. It gets nothing out of your brushes. Stick with the e.l.f. brush shampoo.</li>
    <li> i LIKE THE CLINIQUE CLEANER FOR BRUSHES.  IT WETS MY BRUSHES BETTER.  This one is okay.  The price is good.</li>
    <li> This is such a good product. It actually does help clean my makeup brushes. Although I don&#x27;t wear my makeup nearly as heavy as the Housewives of Atlanta, I do like my makeup, and this product helps by keeping my brushes clean enough to avoid breakouts on my skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> Awful product! It does not clean my brushes rather ruin them....! Save ur money!!</li>
    <li> I love it.It does the job it is supposed to do and its not greasy or soapy feeling.Best purchase I have made and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a ton of money on the expensive name brand ones.</li>
    <li> really nice brush cleaner, and I LOOOOVVVEEEE the smell. I want to get the shampoo one, but you don&#x27;t really need it honestly. I hadn&#x27;t cleaned my brushes in awhile and it work great.</li>
    <li> I just received today and already used it!! I think it&#x27;s really good I don&#x27;t know if it work good/okay/not good smells fine I generally think it works good enough</li>
    <li> Smell great I love it, works well</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> Smells sooooo good! I like it and it is a great cleaner! I needed this so bad I just need to set aside the time to wash and dry the brushes now. I really like the ELF line so far and it is inexpensive</li>
    <li> Good smell but has too much of an oily residue when cleaning brush that stays on while applying makeup</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean the brushes all the way. Does a fair job for its price I guess.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and very good product.Does a great job cleaning my brushes</li>
    <li> Smells great, works well, awesome price. I used it to clean some brushes that I had used for a lot of charcoal black eye shadow, months ago. I was really surprised that it still worked great, and got them clean. Especially since the shadow was some nasty, cheap stuff. I will be buying this frequently, and the amount needed for great results guarantees it will last a long time. I love ths company,in general, and purchasing directly from their site, is safe, and wise.</li>
