      <li>She let me know that it is a very mild soap indeed and has never caused irritations on her baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>The aloe bar is very mildly scented, which I appreciate.</li>
      <li>to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great soap, and I will definitely be buying more.</li>

      <li>If you have very sensitive and highly reactive skin like me than the &amp;#34;Unscented Mild&amp;#34; version of Dr Bronners is best.</li>

      <li>Great stuff, especially if you have fragrance sensitivities!</li>

      <li>Absolutely worth the buy!</li>
      <li>It felt wonderful on my skin, washed off well, and left me feeling clean, soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>and it rinses clean.</li>
      <li>All Dr. Bronners soaps will leave you feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
      <li>and I feel clean..</li>
      <li>The soap does indeed rinse clean.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product that I would highly recommend if you have skin sensitivities or if you have dry skin.  </li>
      <li>This was my first time ever using any of Dr. bronner&#x27;s products, but I am definitely in love with the organic baby mild soap.</li>
      <li>I recommended this bar of soap to my sister who was using a special soap for acne, when she switched to this her cleared up drastically.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to see that they have a baby mild soap while shopping for a friend&#x27;s baby shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The bar is lasting a good while compared to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
      <li>My friend, like me, is concerned with the amount of chemicals that go into most modern beauty products, so she was ecstatic to receive this as a gift.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this whole line.  </li>
      <li>This tried and true bar is just what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I bought a scented bar later, but I think this is still a good buy.</li>
      <li>This soap is great, it cleared up my skin and left it soft and feeling very clean-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, quite nice, and I assume the &#x27;unscented&#x27; means they didn&#x27;t add any scent to it, so you&#x27;re just getting the natural smell of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I purchased this because I wanted to rinse my makeup brushes quickly and was running out of baby shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve taken many showers with the same bar, and still have many</li>
      <li>Quick service and delivery.</li>
      <li>I think this bar would be great for young children with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I used the liquid tea tree soap and left it on my dog for 15 minutes when she had fleas and it worked like magic!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used this before but wanted a safe soap for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is soooo worth it.</li>
      <li>It lathers well, rinses off cleanly and the bar is large and lasts quite awhile.  </li>
      <li>There is no scent to it, but it suds up very well and leaves your skin squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to certain ingredients found in many soaps and shampoos.  </li>
      <li>I am currently trying the tea tree one to see how it does compared to this one for my sensitive skin; so far so good!</li>
      <li>It is gentle and smells good and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals the other soaps do.</li>
      <li>I am usually able to purchase it a bit cheaper at Sprouts locally, but I&#x27;m so glad to know Amazon carries an extensive line of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s products.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, I have personally used them for quite some time.</li>
      <li>* Folks who have skin or allergy issues that are willing to pay a premium price for a soap with no additives.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>I love all Dr. Bronners soaps especially this one.</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend any of these soaps, but baby mild, tea tree, &amp; peppermint are my absolute favorites!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it othere than very clean...not fresh linen but a nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>This soap leaves my skin feeling soft and clean without drying it out.</li>
      <li>With a newborn, a 3 year old, and an 11 year old in the house, we get some interesting stains in this house, and I haven&#x27;t yet come across a stain</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with its performance, but its a niche product and not a good value.</li>
      <li>My son has extremely sensitive, fair skin - and has even reacted negatively to other hand crafted, organic, EO scented soaps.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for more natural soap options and this seemed to be a common and popular choice, so</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it was a fairly large bar.</li>
      <li>The bar is large</li>
      <li>It is much easier for me to manage and keep out of his eyes when shampooing him.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the Dr Bronner liquid soap and really like it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good for brushing teeth, almost no taste to it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this soap! Absolutely worth the buy! Very mild and does the job well! Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for more natural soap options and this seemed to be a common and popular choice, so I bought a bar to try out. In my opinion, it was a fairly large bar. The first time I used it, I liked it. It felt wonderful on my skin, washed off well, and left me feeling clean, soft and smooth. Not dried out at all. I kept running my hands over my arms because they felt so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is an unscented soap, it does have what I would call a typical soap smell to it. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, quite nice, and I assume the &#x27;unscented&#x27; means they didn&#x27;t add any scent to it, so you&#x27;re just getting the natural smell of the ingredients. It makes no difference to me, but if you want a product that actually has no smell, this won&#x27;t be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar is lasting a good while compared to what I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s a pretty hard bar, not soft like some of them that seem to wash half away the first time you use it. I&#x27;ve taken many showers with the same bar, and still have many to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great soap, and I will definitely be buying more. I will probably also try some of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other varieties.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but not $6 good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for personal use as an adult just to get away from all the scents and perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* The soap does indeed rinse clean.  You feel clean and not filmy as with most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Price! You would think that a soap without the additives that drive up cost would be less expensive than its peppermint/wintergreen siblings.  However, not so.&lt;br /&gt;* Lasts no longer than other commercial soaps.  At this price you would hope that the bar would be denser or longer lasting, but (again) not so. I&#x27;ve had some milled french hotel bar soaps last longer than this bar did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best uses:&lt;br /&gt;* Folks who have skin or allergy issues that are willing to pay a premium price for a soap with no additives.&lt;br /&gt;* Hunters who want to be scent-free in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with its performance, but its a niche product and not a good value. Cut the price in half and then let&#x27;s talk. Otherwise, a bar of Ivory is a much better value.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s organic, and it&#x27;s without artificial ANYTHING. I have been using the liquid soap and the bars for years, and our family uses Dr. Bronners exclusively. I recommended this bar of soap to my sister who was using a special soap for acne, when she switched to this her cleared up drastically. I used the liquid tea tree soap and left it on my dog for 15 minutes when she had fleas and it worked like magic! I use this soap on my son and when he plays in the bath and puts his hand in his mouth after they have been in the water, it&#x27;s one less thing I have to stress about, because there are no nasty chemicals in this marvelous soap!</li>
    <li> This soap WILL NOT LEAVE YOUR FACE FEEL LIKE IT IS CRACKING after you use it. VERY gentle on my dry skin. I love this soap!!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time ever using any of Dr. bronner&#x27;s products, but I am definitely in love with the organic baby mild soap. I have the bar soap because I thought it would last longer &amp; be easier to work with (for my specific needs) rather than the liquid soap; however, I would like to also try the liquid baby mild soap. I decided to purchase it to use on my 4 month old son. He has very dry skin &amp; several rough, scaly patches (I believe it may be eczema but he hasn&#x27;t been medically diagnosed yet) and I brought the soap in hopes that the Castile soap would help his skin retain moisture. At the time I was using Aveeno baby soap &amp; lotion, and I felt that it may have been drying his skin out. So far I&#x27;ve been using dr. bronner&#x27;s for about a month &amp; and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in his skin. I&#x27;ve also changed the lotions I use on his skin. Along with using this soap to bathe my son, I also use this soap to scrub out poop stains before putting the clothes in the washer machine. I breast feed &amp; my son has frequent (about 1-3 times per week) blow out diaper messes. When he has a blow out I hand-scrub his clothes in the sink, before putting them in the washer. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s removes poop stains better than the baby dreft laundry detergent that I use !! It removes the stain phenomenally. And I&#x27;ve never noticed any damages to the color or quality of his clothes&#x27; fabric.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this soap for bathing, as well as a clothing stain remover. I look forward to using other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products &amp; exploring what other uses they may have.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have two children.  One is two years old and the other is six months old.  We all use this soap and love it.  It lathers nicely, has a pleasant natural smell, is gentle on the skin, and leaves you feeling fresh and clean.  My son and I have very dry skin and suffer from mild eczema, and we will never switch to another soap!</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap because I needed something to wash my face with that was just natural- no perfumes or extra stuff. This soap is great, it cleared up my skin and left it soft and feeling very clean- what soap is suppose to do!</li>
    <li> I love all Dr. Bronners soaps especially this one. It&#x27;s great for sensitive and oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin since it&#x27;s made with oils and it dissolves the dirt as well the oil. All Dr. Bronners soaps will leave you feeling refreshed and clean. I LOVE THEM! Definitely will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, especially if you have fragrance sensitivities!</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I like it because it&#x27;s unscented so I don&#x27;t need to worry about what chemicals might have been used to scent it.  Quick service and delivery.</li>
    <li> GREAT soap for my babies! I use it in their hair as well! I wish I had known about this when my son had eczema - I&#x27;m sure it would have helped.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I wanted to rinse my makeup brushes quickly and was running out of baby shampoo. This smells heavenly. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it othere than very clean...not fresh linen but a nice clean smell. As for my brushes, it cleans those very well. My makeup brushes do not stain the soap either so that&#x27;s awesome. Sometimes there is a makeup stain.</li>
    <li> Bought to make laundry soap; great prices compared to several other places I tried to find the unscented and shipped wonderfully. My clothes are clean and bright!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this soap. This is my first time trying it. I will definitely be getting it again...maybe trying some of the scents.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. B&#x27;s soaps! My son has extremely sensitive, fair skin - and has even reacted negatively to other hand crafted, organic, EO scented soaps. The unscented baby mild bar is so awesome for him. It is much easier for me to manage and keep out of his eyes when shampooing him. It lasts us a long time, &amp; I also cut the bar in half when I get them so it is easier for me to hold. I store it on a wooden soap deck after his bath and it never gets mushy or gross. I&#x27;ve also recently started using is as my face wash, and my skin looks great! My skin tends to dry out during the winter, but not with Dr. B&#x27;s! I highly recommend any of these soaps, but baby mild, tea tree, &amp; peppermint are my absolute favorites!</li>
    <li> What can someone say about a bar of soap? It grates well if using it to make home made dish washing liquid</li>
    <li> I have yet to use this. I purchased this for my daughter to use. She is not a fan of scents, so I am hoping she will love this product. I am a big fan of Dr Bronners products though</li>
    <li> When I ran out of my favourite ( and expensive) natural laundry soap, I decided to make my own, and found a recipe with Dr Bronners soap, borax and washing soda. I decided to give it a try , and found out that it works just as well... for less money!</li>
    <li> This is great soap!  I am sensitive to certain ingredients found in many soaps and shampoos.  This bar doesn&#x27;t contain any of them.  It lathers well, rinses off cleanly and the bar is large and lasts quite awhile.  I am usually able to purchase it a bit cheaper at Sprouts locally, but I&#x27;m so glad to know Amazon carries an extensive line of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s products.  Awesome stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this before but wanted a safe soap for my sensitive skin. This tried and true bar is just what I wanted. Just what Mom would have recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for years and they are the best organic soaps around.  You can trust it to be what you expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that I would highly recommend if you have skin sensitivities or if you have dry skin.  I really like this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered a six-pack of this kind of soap, which I reviewed as 5 stars.  But this was meant to be one bar of this soap with aloe in the title.  I did not send back one bar of soap, but I did not receive exactly what I ordered.  I would not have ordered six soaps and then a separate one of the same thing.</li>
    <li> Like the ingredients and does a good job cleaning body in shower</li>
    <li> If you have very sensitive and highly reactive skin like me than the &amp;#34;Unscented Mild&amp;#34; version of Dr Bronners is best. I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to fragrances, and even natural fragrances can be very irritating. For example the Peppermint and Lavender, eventhough scented with the natural oils, I found to be way too harsh. Hope this helps those who are searching for a soap for truly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect soap for anyone looking for chemical free soap or who has sensitive skin!!! You will not b disappointed!</li>
    <li> Does it get any better than this soap? NO. I have never used this soap before and I can now say without a doubt I will never use another soap again other than this brand. It is soooo worth it. It does not leave your skin oily or slick. It doesn&#x27;t leave it overly dry either. It just seems to have a perfect balance of both and it rinses clean. Where I live, hard water is what we have and this soap has a great effect even with hard water. I don&#x27;t know why, but it also has a &#x27;soothing&#x27; or relaxing type of feel to it on the skin. Whatever the deal is with this stuff, I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Dr Bronner liquid soap and really like it so I thought I&#x27;d try the bar.  Not disappointed.  Lathers great and rinses clean.  The bar is large so I tried cutting it--didn&#x27;t work too well as the smaller part broke into pieces.  I use it for washing my face and body.  As with other soaps do not leave it where the water will constantly be on it or your soap will be gone too quickly.  Will be using again.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to find a body soap with all natural ingredients that my skin appreciated. This soap leaves my skin feeling soft and clean without drying it out. It&#x27;s gentle enough for me to use on my face as well. The aloe bar is very mildly scented, which I appreciate. I liked it so much that I also replaced my liquid hand soap with one of these bars.</li>
    <li> I use this for stain removal. I rub the bar right on a stain, scrub with an old toothbrush, rinse and repeat until the stain is gone. With a newborn, a 3 year old, and an 11 year old in the house, we get some interesting stains in this house, and I haven&#x27;t yet come across a stain this soap can&#x27;t get out -- even set in ones (week old stain of spaghetti sauce on a white sweater was no match, I was SHOCKED and pleased it came out) love love love this soap!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this whole line.  I use the liquid soap for my newborn&#x27;s bath and the bar soap for homemade laundry detergent.  With all the nasty chemicals in bath products, it&#x27;s nice to know I have a natural solution.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and this soap was so gentle and I feel clean.. Just great I&#x27;ll be purchasing more for sure..</li>
    <li> Love this product but why does it have to come in a shoebox sized package???  Not very environmental.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap we use for the little guys. It is gentle and smells good and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals the other soaps do. It doesn&#x27;t seem to bother the eyes either.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and its great for people who are sensitive to fragrances. I dont usually like bar soaps but this one makes my skin feel smooth and it lasts for a long time. I have always been a fan of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps. I am currently trying the tea tree one to see how it does compared to this one for my sensitive skin; so far so good!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap out of the Bronners because my skin doesn&#x27;t have a reaction with this baby-mild blend.  If I wash with the other scented kinds, I normally get irritation depending on where I use it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, I have personally used them for quite some time. I was really excited to see that they have a baby mild soap while shopping for a friend&#x27;s baby shower. My friend, like me, is concerned with the amount of chemicals that go into most modern beauty products, so she was ecstatic to receive this as a gift. She let me know that it is a very mild soap indeed and has never caused irritations on her baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> I use for everything, in everything (it seems) and have always been happy. Quality, etc&lt;br /&gt;Have used since the early 70&#x27;s. lol</li>
    <li> I use this for hiking to cut down on weight. 1 bar of soap serves as soap, shaving cream, shampoo, and toothpaste.  It works for all of those purposes but it tastes like crap.  While it will work in a pinch I would suggest dealing with the extra weight and space to pack a travel size tube of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an SLS free organic soap bar and came across this one! There is no scent to it, but it suds up very well and leaves your skin squeaky clean. I think this bar would be great for young children with sensitive skin. I bought a scented bar later, but I think this is still a good buy.</li>
    <li> love Dr Bronners soap great for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This is mild but will leave quite a lot of residue behind in my bathtub and I can kind of feel it on my skin too. I&#x27;m not real happy with it.</li>
