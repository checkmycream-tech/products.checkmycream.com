    <li> Awesome product arrived quickly will buy again</li>
    <li> It description says that this soap is all natural but it has added fragrance. I wanted a true all natural soap bc my baby has sever allergies. Very disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> This soap is a quality product that I use daily.&lt;br /&gt;It does wonders for your hands and skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased it twice from this company and the deliver high quality and on time.</li>
    <li> Manuka Honey Wild Fern soap definately cleans your skin without leaving any residue. A lot of soaps leave a film on your face after you wash it, manuka honey wild fern soap doesn&#x27;t. Also leaves your skin soft.</li>
    <li> I first purchased a small bar while in Napier, NZ. Once home, I tried it and immediately went to the Amazon to see if I couldn&#x27;t find more. I use it on my face and it does not dry it out. It left my skin soft. Great product.</li>
    <li> First discovered this soap while in NZ in 2007. Been a believer ever since and only wish I could buy online the small bars for travel which I picked up when back in NZ in 2009.  This soap is NOT \\&quot;drying\\&quot; and since I suffer from dry skin, it&#x27;s been a real blessing. Love the mild scent. Use it on my face and body and no irritation or eye sting etc.  Cannot say enough good things about this soap and the entire Wild Ferns product line.  Koru Naturals ships fast and they do a super job with their packaging also. Definitely 2 thumbs up and five stars!</li>
    <li> Great for my skin, I see an added moisture retention and nice elasticity. I&#x27;ve been using for 3 months and won&#x27;t go back to body wash.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic soap.  I use it on my face in our cold Northern climate, and my skin stays nice and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Manuka Honey Pure &amp; Gentle Soap 100g This is my very first purchase and use of this product.  I am enjoying every time I shower and uses this soap.  The only thing is getting that second liner off the soap....It takes a lot of time to try to get it off.  The outer wrap is OK it is the clear wrap is the problem.</li>
    <li> The yummiest soap I have ever used! Nice lather, pleasant scent and a good clean feeling afterwards!  I am totally hooked and will be ordering more</li>
    <li> This has become a lifesaver for me</li>
    <li> This product has toxic ingredients that were not listed on the website: Yellow 5, Yellow 6 among others.</li>
    <li> A wonderful soap.  I have read all about this soap and I am happy to use it on my skin,</li>
    <li> Best alternative for Triclosan-based washes and soaps if you need an antibacterial wash. It washes and cleans very well &amp; also helps with my excessive oil issue on my face. I highly recommend it for people with troubled skin.</li>
    <li> Seemed to be good for skin</li>
    <li> My face, my skin is very sensitive. I purchased this item after much searching,  very satisfied. Clearly soft my skin. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this honey bar. It smells so nice and lathers up very well. My skin feels so soft after two weeks of using it. I have a few fine lines on my face, i am 47, and i swear since using this they are gently disappearing! Worth every penny and will be ordering more...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for some time and I gave my niece a bar - she&#x27;s hooked too.  It gently cleans and has a nice gentle fragrance.</li>
    <li> It is a healing soap  Ihad some blemishes on my skin it cleared them up ...I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I fell asleep on this one by \\&quot;not\\&quot; reading the ingredients prior to ordering. Why would the seller put so many artificial and synthetic ingredients in with something as beneficial and natural as manuka honey. Before ordering this product check out the ingredients in the soap. I took off a star for the unnatural ingredients (one of them is perfume) and the small size of the soap. Otherwise, you can detect the manuka honey in the smell of the soap and the moisturizing properties. Will \\&quot;NOT\\&quot; reorder.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap , especially for dry and sensitive skin.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Best soap i&#x27;ve ever used. No itch!</li>
    <li> I tried everything to clear up poison ivy including prescriptions from my doctor. NOTHING worked until I used the honey soap.</li>
    <li> This Manuka Honey Soap is the best. I use it in the shower,at my bathroom sink and the kitchen sink. When you rinse you feel squeaky clean. I ran out of shampoo and I even used it to wash my hair. Great soap.</li>
    <li> Arrived super quickly which was a nice surprise! As to be expected this soap gets &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; quickly. Smells great and decent lather.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a Christmas present in a basket with other things.  My sister loved it &amp; asked where she could get more.</li>
    <li> Great soap better than all I have used so far!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff:) it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I ended up buying a different brand of soap from  an another company. Such as the &amp;#34;Healing Garden&amp;#34;. Sadly I never recieved my order from vendor in 2014. Honey soaps smell so delicious in a hot water bath. If your not the type to bathe in a tub ..I suggest you use a steam shower to enjoy the benfits of the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was given a small bar as a gift.  I loved it but when I ordered the product was different.  I really liked the impregnated soap that you get a good scrub ......and scratch.  The big size is smooth ...  The soap is really nice</li>
    <li> I have stopped using any other brands for bath and body care.  Manuka Honey is one of the best natural products on the market today.  My skin has a beautiful sheen to it and a softness it never had before.  The soap combined with the moisturing body butter and lotion makes a total skin care package.</li>
    <li> Have very sensitive skin and absolutely love this soap and its delicate,not overpowering smell. Many soaps, even described as for sensitive skin, I am unable to tolerate.</li>
    <li> cant see much diffrent,doesnt take off all dirty from face!</li>
    <li> I like this company- they really want you the customer to be happy. I love manuka honey and use it for everything. Its expensive soap but great quality. Someone who has MRSA or is trying to fight infection etc this is great to clean with. I would recommend one bar per person if using it to heal.</li>
    <li> This is a really awesome soap! It smells so good - like honey :)&lt;br /&gt;It seems to last longer than I thought it would and its non-drying. It leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels, nice and gentle. Not sure if it&#x27;s helping my acne or not, but it feels and smells nice.</li>
    <li> This soap has a soft honey fragrance, leave skin so soft</li>
    <li> This is the only soap my skin loves....If I use anything else, my skin is angry, red and itchy. This product keeps my skin healthy....as one of my friends told me....\\&quot;Your skin is AMAZING.\\&quot;</li>
