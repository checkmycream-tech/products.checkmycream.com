<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Braun Clean &amp; Renew 3 Pack  was LTA (less than adequate), disappointing regarding the frequency with which the cartridges needed to be replaced. Each cartridge had to be replaced frequently, thus a three pack would need to be purchased and utilized more frequently than desired.</li>
    <li> I love my Braun razor, but these refill cartridges have been a problem for me. They tend to last through only one single cleaning before going into a &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; state and then have to be replaced. I either have to find a better solution, or a different way to clean my razor.  I think there ARE other options - even using the small cleaning brush works OK - but these expensive cartridges and this process have not been effective for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this solution from Amazon because it&#x27;s always in stock.  I&#x27;ve tried some brick-and-mortar stores in Houston, but they are sometimes out of stock.  The solution works in my Braun razor cleaning appliance, and it works simply great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for four years and it gets the job done. This is the best price I&#x27;ve ever paid for this solution.</li>
    <li> Excellent service at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great price and delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> We were surprised that the product contained three units and priced so well. I was able to share one of the containers with my son in law. We love Amazon</li>
    <li> as advertised quick shipping. first impressions it&#x27;s a whole lot better than my Phillips norelco</li>
    <li> Like the price, product was as I expect,&lt;br /&gt;It was very good. package and delivery very good.&lt;br /&gt;will buy some more soon. Will recommended this product.</li>
    <li> BEST AND EASIEST WAY TO EXTEND RAZOR QUALITY.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a good system.  The holder shows how intense the cleaning needs to be - push start and it&#x27;s automatically done. Simple and effective.</li>
    <li> Great product and timely shipping!</li>
    <li> Theses refills are exactly the same as the one the unit comes with. Only a fraction of the price though. Great find, even better price</li>
    <li> The Braun Razor is excellent.  We order the Clean and Renew Pack so it&#x27;s always available.  Anything ordered is excellent.</li>
    <li> The Braun electric razor is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned. Buying the cleaning cartridges is a small price to pay for a great shave.</li>
    <li> works well but a little expansive</li>
    <li> Cleans shaver very well but the liquid cleaning agent does not last very long, otherwise product works well if expensive.</li>
    <li> Quite good and useful to keep the Braun shaver I have clean and lubricated.  Major problem with it in my opinion is the simple fact that when the cleaning station is turned on with the shaver in place the cleaning solution sort of sprays and shoots out of the cleaning station and covers the counter.  I&#x27;ve tried several ways to slow or prevent it but none have worked.  Next is a medicine dropper and bottle to draw out and store some of the liquid.  Maybe?</li>
    <li> Works great and great price.</li>
    <li> I was extremely satisfied with the product i received. It was exactly what i ordered and exactly what i wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sick of buying cleaning cartridges, this was my last purchase of them.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a razor cleaning solution.  It fits and it works well.</li>
    <li> The are exactly what I needed for my Braun series 5 razor cleaning system.  And at the best price I could find.</li>
    <li> easy to remove and replace. Cleans blades quickly and leaves the razor with a clean smell.no messy cleanup., don&#x27;t have to worry about wife saying I left a messy sink.</li>
    <li> The product from Braun is very good as expected. However I think it took a little too much time to arrive. Other than that  the vendor is reliable and I would use him again if necessary.</li>
    <li> This product does what it is supposed to do.  I&#x27;ve used the solution numerous times, happy to say to the least.  Thank you for selling this and many other products.</li>
    <li> Fits in my shaver.  Works well.  Cannot ask for anything more.  I&#x27;d buy it again.  Something I do is close the container when not in use to prevent evaporation.  And I clean my braun shaver every time I use it.</li>
    <li> just like new after replacement , just what I needed</li>
    <li> I love the scent if the cleaner my favorite. It is easier to buy online than going out locally trying to find it.</li>
    <li> Best news is that we don&#x27;t have to replace the cartridges very often for it to keep doing its thing!</li>
    <li> Received as described. Good Seller.</li>
    <li> Braun cleaner is the only one that fits the razor stand and it does a decent job of keeping the razor clean.</li>
    <li> No bargain -- priced too high</li>
    <li> 3 pack is cheaper than buying them one at a time at retail...but for my money, still way over priced for what it is.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace - no mess, no mistakes. Makes this Braun shaver an even better product. I am glad these are readily available.</li>
    <li> cleans and smells good.</li>
    <li> competitive prices for a 3 pack. it seems like certain stores dont carry the 3 pack any more so this was nice</li>
    <li> Keeping a well used shaver in great shape!</li>
    <li> Works and the correct 3 pack  No problems</li>
    <li> Warning - if you have a 350 series model, a 300 series cutter will not work - 500 series fits all 500 series models</li>
    <li> This is cheap and cleans my shaver really good, plus it smells good all the time. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Braun elec. shavers and related items for their shaver are the best there is! Trust me, I&#x27;ve done my research on them all!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great shaver.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> Yes, even though the product image shown is for the two pack, when it arrived, there was a third Clean and Renew pack shrinkwrapped to the box. Great deal...I hate running out of this stuff!</li>
    <li> razor feels like new after every use. must have for braun razors</li>
    <li> Have reordered many times.  Good price. Easy to order.</li>
    <li> It is a bonus to have found this source.  I needed it to keep my new electric shaver in mint condition as long as possible.</li>
    <li> Just like what the box stores have to offer!!</li>
    <li> This a good value on Braun original clean and renew cartridges.</li>
    <li> Hard to complain about something that does exactly what it is supposed to do, especially when it&#x27;s really the only actual option you have for the devices it&#x27;s used for. That does create some price gouging, but I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper item to refill the cartridge with, and it was just awful, so I&#x27;ll continue buying these instead.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipper!</li>
    <li> works great with a great razer</li>
    <li> A perfect fit and a good price for the 3 pack... received quickly and well packed in original container.&lt;br /&gt;•&lt;br /&gt;I had thought my blades were in need of replacement, but I only needed to go thru a full clean cycle with this product.</li>
    <li> A lot better price than what you can find in the stores - quality product that seems to do what it is supposed to do. The Braun shaver is great! Superior to the Norelco rotaries ...... excellent shaves.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this for only 20 bucks. Plus the Prime 2 day shipping doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  If you have a Braun 7 series, then you must&lt;br /&gt;use this product to keep your razor clean.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did a good job delivering my order.</li>
    <li> Great Product! was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Enjoy the cleaning system that uses the clean and renew  solution.  The razor appears to be cleaner when using the solution.</li>
    <li> products arrived swiftly.  Razor seems to be doing well using these cleansing materials.</li>
    <li> ALWAY WORKED WELL FOR ME</li>
    <li> Received as promised.</li>
    <li> Fine transaction. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Same as earlier; works well.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what my husband needed as we could not get it locally.</li>
    <li> when you need it you need it</li>
    <li> exactly what I need at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Good value for money.</li>
    <li> Braun is the tops in electric Shavers and this product is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this item for its quality.</li>
    <li> Keeps my husband&#x27;s razor running smooth &amp; has since 2008!</li>
    <li> If you want a bang for your buck this is the way to go. I researched many places to get these and for value for money this is the best one. It keeps hubby&#x27;s razor clean and lubricated.</li>
    <li> came broken and not even the correct product</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have owned only two Braun razors in my lifetime, and they last forever. My current one is kept clean and sterile by this excellent cleaning product.</li>
    <li> I ordered these since I couldn&#x27;t find them stocked anywhere near where I live; these work great and the price is awesome!</li>
    <li> Expensive but far better than the pseudo Organics companies are selling as refills.  Stay with Braun, always the best but more expensive</li>
    <li> This is the most economical way to buy the cleaning fluid.  The fluid really works well, keeping the shaver running smoothly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> Perfect, great price and excellent delivery, Thanks</li>
    <li> I like this cleaner it comes in a very solid container and is so easy to change.  It keeps my shaver nice and clean at all times.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it and is happy with it. He is 92 years old and has used it for years</li>
    <li> Was exactly what my husband needed for his electric razor.</li>
    <li> good deal on a necessity</li>
    <li> This product works great with my Braun shaver.  I have used this product for several years without any problems and my shaver stays very fresh!</li>
    <li> Replacement cleaning cartridges work as designed!</li>
    <li> Nothing touches this baby face except Braun. Nothing.</li>
    <li> So far we have only used one but they fit and work well - there really isn&#x27;t much more to say.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave the shaver cleaner plugged in all the time nor do I use the cleaner everyday. It seems to be more than enough to use the cleaner/charger every other day or so. I don&#x27;t mind capping the cleaner container. It saves product from evaporation.</li>
    <li> Worked fine, just a bit pricy.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and fits my cleaning unit perfectly.</li>
    <li> fair price good replacement</li>
    <li> Very good and goodservic</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years....dependable, always performs as expected...will help maintain your shaver for a longer life</li>
    <li> Nothing to like or love with this.  They are simply replacement packs for my razor and are the correct part :-)</li>
    <li> My husband only uses this Braun electric razor.  It shaves him just like a blade razor would, without cuts. Smells good too.</li>
    <li> okay, its the right cleaner solution and the right price.</li>
    <li> I choose the rating because the Braun shaver systems are more than adequate and more than worth the cost . . .</li>
    <li> I have used this razor cleaner for several years and find it entirely satisfactory.  Cleans all the &amp;#34;beard dust&amp;#34; out of the head and leaves a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good seller.</li>
    <li> Great razor with auto clean system. Visible gauge on charger body indicates when cleaning fluid needs to be changed. One touch clean. Rather noisy but effective. Easy to change. Keeping solution lid makes disposal and transport easy. No problem through TSA.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price!</li>
    <li> Ordered...Came on time...Fits perfectly.  Husband well satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Have ordered twice and both times everything has come and was exactly right.&lt;br /&gt;What a great way to shop at home.</li>
    <li> just needed some refill kits.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like about Braun Cleaners for one of the best electric shavers out there.&lt;br /&gt;One of these will keep your Braun Shaver looking new and shaving like it a lot longer.</li>
    <li> I thought this was discontinued.  They work great for cleaning my shaver. Recommended for keeping your shaver clean and working.</li>
    <li> Good product for electric razor cleaning. Thanks for carrying this product as it is getting more difficult to find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Good product BUT it&#x27;s the $$$.</li>
    <li> I am so sorry I got involved with Braun shaving products. The price for anything associated with Braun shaving is outrageous and over-rated, and I&#x27;m being gentle at best. The whole product line for this shaver is out of line for the results you get. I will never get another $200.00 razor and have to feed it like a mink or show cat. These cleaners $16.00, the shave cartridge $50.00 and alot of people only get about a good year or two out of these over-priced razors. I have only used the cartridge I have for 3 weeks and need to refill it again,(WHAT A SUCKER I AM). Please take my advice and research before you even think about anything associated with Braun shaving</li>
    <li> Its ok..still cheapest way to get these, but still a bit pricy..if I started shaving every day these will come in handy as they really do help keep the rwazor blade sharp and sanitary</li>
    <li> Very well worth the price for a great shave.  It keeps everything good to go for the next great shave.</li>
    <li> you don&#x27;t know what it is then grow a beard and shave with-out cleaning your braun.</li>
    <li> Excellent arrived on time, Thankyou</li>
    <li> Did what it was supposed to do</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning a shaver more than 10 years old.  Nice that this product is still available.</li>
    <li> I ordered these 3 Braun Renew and Refresh refills.  They were much cheaper than you can get them at the store so it was worth a gamble.  They arrived less than a week later and were exactly what I ordered.  A+++++ Seller :)</li>
    <li> Received as advertised.</li>
    <li> Does precisely what it is supposed to do...clean your Braun electric razor thoroughly. Only negative observation is that it is rather expensive for a product that appears to be mostly alcohol based. Indeed, when it shows that it is time to refill, you may want to consider simply cleaning out the container and refilling it with plain alcohol.</li>
    <li> Product as described/expected, shipped quickly, and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected and working just fine.</li>
    <li> Always the right cleaning fluid.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product to keep that brand new razor feel every day. Huge savings over buying in a retail setting for the exact same product. I will buy my cleaning fluid here from now on.</li>
    <li> Was missing one. Should have received three.</li>
    <li> I bought the shaver for my husband. He loves it. Now, whenever I need refills, I just order off amazon, and they are delivered right to my front door.</li>
