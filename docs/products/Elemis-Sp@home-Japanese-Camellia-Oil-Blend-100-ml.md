      <li>but it goes on smoothly and its not greasy on your clothes which was a shock.</li>

      <li>Great massage oil with nice fragrance that is not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance that doesn&#x27;t stick with you for too long, and it isn&#x27;t greasy after it&#x27;s been on your skin for a while; so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>It was in its original manufacturer box and plastic wrapped.</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Originally introduced to this on a cruise ship.  </li>
      <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
      <li>nothing too special.</li>
      <li>Love it so much, bought a bottle for a cousin as well.  </li>
      <li>The oil smells nice and natural, nothing &amp;#34;artificial&amp;#34; about it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for a niece who is pregnant.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell so its good if your sensitive to smells like I am.</li>
      <li>I am 8 months pregnant with no stretch marks!By this time in my moms pregnancy</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and week packaged.</li>
      <li>I started to use this item when I was about 5 months pregnant</li>
      <li>I bought this when I was pregnant because I heard it worked</li>
      <li>and I recommend it to every pregnant woman I see.</li>
      <li>Great if I&#x27;m storing my straight razor, a lil goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I know stretch marks are more linked to genetics, but so far this has worked on my skin!</li>
      <li>I love this oil, I rub it on my tummy to help prevent stretch marks, I&#x27;m in my 7th month of pregnancy and so far it&#x27;s been working!</li>
      <li>This is not only nice oil...</li>
      <li>Love the smell and so far it looks like my stretch marks are fading.</li>
      <li>This is our third baby and the third time we have used this type of oil with great success!</li>
      <li>I love how fast this arrived, I was very surprised!</li>
      <li>I use it right after I shower twice a day to keep my belly hydrated.</li>
      <li>I started applying this to avoid stretch marks right around 4 months of my pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>The smell is really relaxing and mild.</li>
      <li>It really works to keep my feet soft and healthy...</li>
      <li>though the development of stretch marks is largely genetics and weight gain during pregnancy, and as far as i&#x27;ve read cannot be really prevented by any cream, i still enjoyed using this to moisturize my skin every night during pregnancy.</li>
      <li>it works well as massage oil also; we first found this on the Disney cruise ship spa.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks for the first 8months.  </li>
      <li>I love that it has multiple uses as well!</li>
      <li>The best description of this product is that it is not only a stand alone product that you can apply all over your damp body immediately after shower/bath for added moisture or this can be used as a massage oil, or you can combine 5-6 drops in the palm of your hand, along with some of the milk bath or body lotion for extra luxurious moisturizing anytime you want to be transported to the blissful realms of total indulgence, which for me is anytime I want!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is wonderful to prevent stretch marks. I used it from 2nd trimester till after birth. Not a single stretch mark.&lt;br /&gt;And I have a history of having stretch marks from just putting on and losing weight.&lt;br /&gt;I still use this periodically when my weight&#x27;s fluctuating.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a bonus that it smells good. I had bad morning sickness all the way. This was one of the few things I could tolerate using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard very good things about this product for helping with stretch marks during pregnancy.  I won&#x27;t really know how well it works until I&#x27;ve started to go back to my pre-pregnancy shape.  It has a nice fragrance that doesn&#x27;t stick with you for too long, and it isn&#x27;t greasy after it&#x27;s been on your skin for a while; so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> This oil is great it lasts for a long time very little goes a long way and it really does smell delightful. It gives you the feeling of being in a spa every time you open the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is not only nice oil...it works well as massage oil also; we first found this on the Disney cruise ship spa.</li>
    <li> I started applying this to avoid stretch marks right around 4 months of my pregnancy.  I&#x27;m at 7.5 months now, no stretch marks yet!  I have to say that at first the idea of smearing oil all over my belly grossed me out, but this stuff is really lightweight, absorbs quickly, no weird smell.  1 bottle will last me about 4 months, and a little goes a long way, so although pricey (as I&#x27;m definitely not an expensive skin cream kinda girl), it lasts a long time.  I do firmly believe that genetics has more to do with whether you get stretch marks or not (my mom didn&#x27;t have any after 2 kids, and she used the classic -- cocoa butter), and I heard having darker skin helps too, but I think this oil helps a bit too, at least to prep your skin for all the stress and stretching it&#x27;s about to endure.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for pregnant woman who do not want stretch marks ! I used this with my first two pregnancies, now I&#x27;m on my third, and I only developed one tiny stretch mark. I also use this on my body, a tiny amount on my face as a moisturizer, and a little drop for the ends of my hair after showering . Great stuff !</li>
    <li> Love it. The oil sinks into your skin quickly. Isn&#x27;t too greasy. The smell is really relaxing and mild. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to try to avoid stretch marks during pregnancy.  So far so good!  This is really lightweight and has a great smell...I try to use it everynight before bed.  I was a little concerned if it was worth the price, but I&#x27;ve found that a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Great massage oil with nice fragrance that is not overwhelming. I have ordered this several times.  Always received in good shape.  I had a bottle that I had bought locally (but didn&#x27;t remember where).  My son says you can find anything on Amazon.  I looked and there it was!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and find it very effective for keeping cuticles and hands moist. Lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and so far it looks like my stretch marks are fading.</li>
    <li> I love the oil it really smells nice and softens your skin. I have seen other places sell this oil at a much higher price.</li>
    <li> I am an African American female on my fourth pregnancy (over the age of 36) and I stumbled upon this product. I was already using other products from this line before I became pregnant, like the Frangipani oil and the Cellutox oil. Both of those products worked very well for me. I decided to try the Camellia oil from this line and that was the best thing I could have done. Not only has kept the stretch marks away; it has also diminished the cellulite that I had on the back of my thighs. My skin is smoother than it has ever been. I previously used the Palmer&#x27;s coconut butter and that never seemed to absorb into my skin; it would just make a mess on my clothes, and I still had stretch marks after using it. Of course stretch marks are genetic so I can blame my DNA for that, but OMG, I just love Elemis&#x27;s Camellia oil. I&#x27;m so impressed with my results. I highly recommend this product. It is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I rub it on my tummy to help prevent stretch marks, I&#x27;m in my 7th month of pregnancy and so far it&#x27;s been working! It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s an oil because it&#x27;s easy and gentle to run into my skin.</li>
    <li> I used this product for both of my pregnancies, back to back and I recommend it to every pregnant woman I see. My mother had A LOT of stretch marks and I know they are genetic so I was going to try and prevent as many as I could. By the end of both my pregnancies I only have a total of FOUR stretch marks!!!! 2 on each butt cheek, hehehe. Added bonus is this also has almond oil in it and my brazilian friend swears by it...</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, especially when I give her a full body massage! I first found this at an Elemis Spa on a cruise ship, while my wife was in getting a massage. I was apprehensive about spending $50 on the bottle, but she had bought $Hundreds of stuff for therapeutic bathing at home, so, no problem! This stuff is an external aphrodisiac! You might even &amp;#34;get lucky!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m not just called DIY husband because I repair everything around the house, which I do. And it&#x27;s cheaper online than on a cruise ship!</li>
    <li> Awesome for pregnancy stretch mark prevention. I even put a little on the ends of my dry, frizzy hair! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Went on a cruise 5 years ago and this is what the spa used on me...have used it since...every day!</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome! Absorbs into your skin with no oily feeling afterwards. My skin glows and feels soft!</li>
    <li> This oil is great.  I used it thoughout my pregnancy.  I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks for the first 8months.  However the begining of my 9th month is when they developed.  I recently found out that stretch marks are genetic.  So, I was really happy with this product and would reccommend it to anyone who is pregnant.</li>
    <li> Originally introduced to this on a cruise ship.  I am a senior citizen with very dry skin.  This is, without a doubt, the best product I have found to counter act that problem.  Love it so much, bought a bottle for a cousin as well.  Most reviews indicate its use for preventing stretch marks during pregnancy, but this product has additional very successful applications for extremely dry skin for both famales and males.  It isn&#x27;t oily (after about 2 minutes post application) and does not stain clothing or sheets.  Use sparingly!</li>
    <li> I got this after being on twitter and seeing a review from Victoria Beckham raving about it. I like it but it does make your hands very oily too!</li>
    <li> Great for anybody! No smell, no grease just prefect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this oil! Prefect for the winter! A must have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use within the year before it goes bad. It is oil you know.</li>
    <li> I applied this everyday once I reached the 4th month of my pregnancy and don&#x27;t have not one stretch mark! I would use this product again for sure!!</li>
    <li> I used this all through my pregnancy and I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. I found it easy to put on and I didn&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this body oil. I have been using it for years. I also use it to condition my skin before tanning.</li>
    <li> I used this religiously during my pregnancy (morning and night) and NO stretch marks.  One happy mama!  Somewhat heavy, but just let it dry a bit before dressing.</li>
    <li> I used this oil on my tummy every morning and night and did not get a single stretch mark!  It is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. discovered it on a cruise. Use it every day as a lotion for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a niece who is pregnant.  She loves the way it makes her skin feel as she is growing.</li>
    <li> Great for pregnant ladies!  Helps avoid stretch marks.  This is our third baby and the third time we have used this type of oil with great success!</li>
    <li> Hi used this oil during my whole pregnancy, and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. My family has a history of them, and I managed to not get any. I think this oil helped alot with preventing that. I did use alot of the oil, rubbed on 2-3 times daily. Ordered a bottle once a month, but I definitely recommend buying it for this purpose.</li>
    <li> BEST prevention for stretch marks, used with two pregnancies (gained 50 lbs with both- and people would say it was all in my stomach- looked like I would tip over).  Those same people still remark when they see my stomach that they can&#x27;t believe I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks. I know this oil was the trick (and my diligence in using it daily pre- and postpartum).</li>
    <li> Used daily throughout my pregnancy and no stretch marks in sight!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product in the Lotus Spa on a cruise on the Princess Cruise line, and the staff combines this camellia oil blend with other products such as Elemis&#x27; Body Lotion/Milk Bath in their heavenly massages.  It is also mixed in their ginger and lime salt scrub, which is devine for exfoliating.  The best description of this product is that it is not only a stand alone product that you can apply all over your damp body immediately after shower/bath for added moisture or this can be used as a massage oil, or you can combine 5-6 drops in the palm of your hand, along with some of the milk bath or body lotion for extra luxurious moisturizing anytime you want to be transported to the blissful realms of total indulgence, which for me is anytime I want!!  I do this often.  Having used the ginger and lime salt scrub, along with the aforementioned oil procedures, I&#x27;ve got a jump on supremely moisturized skin going into shorts season, which hopefully will be in a few weeks or so.  Don&#x27;t wait on this one.  Go for it.  You&#x27;ll never be sorry.  Totally worth it as a little goes a long way.  There is only a lovely, light, barely there type spa fragrance.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I was pregnant because I heard it worked o prevent stretch marks and it worked well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after doing some extensive research on the prevention of stretch marks. The oil smells nice and natural, nothing &amp;#34;artificial&amp;#34; about it. I usually apply about 10 drops around the belly button and rub around the entire belly. This oil absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t stick to my clothing. It is definitely on the pricier end and that is why one star has been deducted. Other than that I have no complaints. I am in my 33 weeks and have been using it every night after shower. So far I have not seen a single stretch mark (crossing my fingers). As the belly gets bigger and feels tighter, applying this oil definitely relieves the feeling of tightness. In my opinion, I would rather buy one expensive bottle that definitely works rather than testing numerous bottles that could potentially work.</li>
    <li> I have been using it since my pregnancy for my tummy!~ Now has been using it for 7months! It is an amazing product!!! Highly recommended~</li>
    <li> Love this product...much lighter scent than the frangipani oil. Readily absorbs and no residue. Shipped quickly and week packaged.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin. Only takes a very small amount and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved her massage using this oil</li>
    <li> Use after showering for pregnancy stretch marks.  Really like so far.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great if I&#x27;m storing my straight razor, a lil goes a long way. I dip a Q-tip inside and lightly apply to the razor, the put rolling paper on the blade to keep the oil where it need to stay. Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell so its good if your sensitive to smells like I am.</li>
    <li> My first bottle of this product came from the Spa of a Carnival cruise ship. Back then the bottle was green, it lasted a long, long time.</li>
    <li> This item is oK except for for late delivery.</li>
    <li> 100ml of Camelia Oil can be obtained for $8.45 from japan woodworker -- this is the exact same stuff. I don&#x27;t have a problem with most of Elemis&#x27;s unique products, but I don&#x27;t see the point of paying $32+ extra for the same content.    Camelia oil is also great for kitchen knives after sharpening, btw. I use it on plane blades. I guess I&#x27;ll have to start using my extra bottle on myself.</li>
    <li> I used it to avoid stretch marks; I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks - not sure if it is due to product or genetics though! Either way - it is a great moisturizer to avoid itchy skin during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine but it&#x27;s over priced for what it really does..nothing too special.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use during pregnancy to prevent stretch marks. At some spas, they use this oil for the prenatal massage.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product with multiple uses.  It was brought to my attention by the Elemis staff on a cruise and I have been using it ever since (about 4 years now)</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time from the spa on a cruise when the massage therapist recommended it to help avoid stretch marks during my pregnancy.  I used it almost daily for most of my pregnancy and had 0 stretch marks.  it is a light-feeling oil with a gentle, pretty scent.  I still use it on dry skin and it works much better than regular lotion.</li>
    <li> have faithfully uesd this oil every night during pregnancy, pleasant smelling. it&#x27;s quite oily so allow time for skin to absorb prior to dressing. though the development of stretch marks is largely genetics and weight gain during pregnancy, and as far as i&#x27;ve read cannot be really prevented by any cream, i still enjoyed using this to moisturize my skin every night during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Been using this since the very beginning of my pregnancy. I use it right after I shower twice a day to keep my belly hydrated. So far it&#x27;s worked well.. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple weeks now once daily at night. My belly still feels rather dry next morning but I hope it&#x27;s doing something to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in my hair for several years.  Just a small amount creates separation in my hair that I am looking for.  You do have to be careful to not use too much or your hair will look oily.  I have thick wavey hair that can get dry looking if just blown out with no product in it.  With this product my hair looks normal, stays under control and is softer.  I would not recommend using this product for your hair if you have straight or thin hair.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible! I mixed with my homemade lotion and also used alone.&lt;br /&gt;I have no stretchmarks!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST for stretch marks. I used it my WHOLE pregnancy from 7 weeks to 41 weeks (yes I went over) and I have NO STRETCH marks. I put it on my stomach and boobs. Stretch marks run in my family too.</li>
    <li> I love how fast this arrived, I was very surprised! It was in its original manufacturer box and plastic wrapped. This oil is wonderful and seems in quickly! This is my 2nd bottle and will continue to use this throughout my first pregnancy!</li>
    <li> So far I do not see any disadvantage of using it. It will give my skin some oil. I have not noticed any differences it made after applying on. I like the smell of it. I am waiting to see if I use it for a long time will my skin become more beautiful or not.</li>
    <li> Bought to help prevent stretch marks during pregnancy via some friends suggestions. 7 months in and no stretch marks! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I started purching this oil over a year ago and it keeps my skin soft and moist.  Use it every day.</li>
    <li> I used this product throughout my whole first pregnancy and NO stretch marks!!!! It is amazing /</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I put it on twice a day and after every shower. I did not get a single stretch mark durning my pregancy!!!!</li>
    <li> I had tried this for the first time on a cruise ship and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It goes deep into your skin to moisten it.  Has a light fragrance that is perfect.  The only drawback is that it contains almond oil.  For most people this would not be a problem, but my husband is allergic and he tried it.  We didn&#x27;t read the ingredients until he had a reaction.</li>
    <li> Not too oily, good smell, running out need to get more only bad thing wish it came in bigger oz</li>
    <li> I started to use this item when I was about 5 months pregnant and I love it! it is light and doesnt leave any grease stains on your clothes! I am 8 months pregnant with no stretch marks!By this time in my moms pregnancy she tells me she was covered, so she too is amazed at this product. I know stretch marks are more linked to genetics, but so far this has worked on my skin! I love that it has multiple uses as well! It I find myself applying to much I just rub it on the ends of my hair!</li>
    <li> My stretch marks are fading quite nicely after having used this product for a good amount of time. I wish they would fade a bit more then they do, but that would probably require a surgery or something.</li>
    <li> I tried this on a cruise and loved it. It really works to keep my feet soft and healthy...</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it on my pregnant belly and torso every night, smells delicious. Great massage oil as well for those nights when your back is in pain, trust me. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  Just what we needed.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great product during pregnancy to keep skin elasticity and prevent stretch marks..also it is good for healthier  hair and nails</li>
    <li> I first heard Victoria Beckham talk about this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because it seemed like a small amount for 40bucks but I love it, now I have to say I&#x27;m pregnant with my 3rd child and I&#x27;m not sure how it will do on my stretch marks but it goes on smoothly and its not greasy on your clothes which was a shock. The smell is unobtrusive to my sensitive pregnant nose and there is a slow flow top that allows you to use enough without using too much and I think it will last longer than I originally thought. Good buy!</li>
