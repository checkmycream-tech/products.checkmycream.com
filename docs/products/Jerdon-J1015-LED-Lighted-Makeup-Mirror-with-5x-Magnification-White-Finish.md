<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The mirror itself is fantastic,  The light bulbs are perfect,never burn out. But the power cord is flimsy where it hooks into the mirror and if it bends the wire actually gets broken.  If not for that I would rate it 5 *</li>
    <li> Very bright.... Exactly what I wanted.....</li>
    <li> exactly what i expected and great value</li>
    <li> Great little lighted mirror!</li>
    <li> Great Mirror Very bright light</li>
    <li> Bought this for my vanity and absolutely love it. The lights are bright and the magnifying mirror is great . Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!!!  Very bright !!  She is glad it uses batteries too!!  Easy for travel!!</li>
    <li> It works, just not enough magnification so its going back</li>
    <li> Bought this mirror from Ulta in July 2014.  At the end of May 2015 the bulbs on the left side of the mirror started flickering, then began alternating between going out completely and flickering.  Another reviewer commented that there is no way to change the bulbs on this, and I can confirm that.  I unscrewed the mirror and opened it.  The LED lights are extremely tiny and the connecting wires appear to be soddered on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Jerdon lighted makeup mirror prior to this one - with regular light bulbs that could be changed - and that one lasted me 7 years before the wiring in the cord died.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my mother and she was very pleased with it.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Bought for gift and it was just what she was looking for!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it has batteries and plugs in for traveling!</li>
    <li> The lighted mirror is just what I was looking for! It provides a close up for tweeting and a nice light for applying makeup too!!</li>
    <li> It was Ok . But light did not work and had to send it back.  Will get a different one.</li>
    <li> mirror lights very bright love it</li>
    <li> Beautifully designed light, works well, but only four stars because brightness is diminished under battery power.  We will&lt;br /&gt;install a 120 volt outlet close by to get full potential from this product.  Otherwise we recommend.</li>
    <li> Lights were too bright and were blinding.  The mirror was returned.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. Brought it on a trip, and it did a beautiful job. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed for traveling. Plenty of mirror to see your entire face (not small like some travel mirrors), and I liked how bright the lights are. The 5X magnification, on the one side, is perfect. Reminds me of my larger, heavier make-up mirror I have at home, which would be too bulky to pack for travel. This one is light, and not large- easy to pack, and convenient. I am so happy with this purchase, and I will use it for many years!</li>
    <li> Decent little mirror. It flips from regular to magnified and there&#x27;s no distortion. The LED lighting is strong enough, so - along with the magnification -- you can REALLY see yourself up close...possibly a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for the faint of heart who don&#x27;t like to see every nook, cranny, and pore on your face. OTOH - that&#x27;s exactly WHY magnification comes in handy: you can see well enough to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; that stuff!  When I first started using this mirror -- I was horrified at what I saw! LOL. But I got used to it- and now when I&#x27;m done applying makeup - I look more polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I appreciated best about the Jerdon, actually - - was how well, at very first use, I was able to more clearly see what my foundation REALLY looked like, applying it as before. From a distance and using a &amp;#34;kind&amp;#34; mirror, I thought everything looked fine, but seeing up so close was a little brutal because it was very clear I was over-applying and creating that detested, cakey look. Younger ladies&#x27; faces can handle piling on lots of make up,  as one gets older, &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; is definitely the cliched kiss of death! So - I now use a far lighter touch applying foundations (mineral powder, cream, lotion) and my finished palette looks better up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few issues might be &amp;#34;Cons&amp;#34; for some, if not deal-breakers -- given the price and portability: the mirror is quite small; there is no &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; lighting (i.e. day/office/evening simulation); sometimes there are shadows cast on my face at certain room lightings and depending on how I am angled toward the mirror; the on/off switch in front has to be jiggled sometimes to get it to stay on, but then it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - this is a very nice little mirror, the LED lighting is consistent and bright enough, it doesn&#x27;t get hot, it&#x27;s lightweight and portable (just stick it back in its box for travel), and its magnification and lighting have definitely resulted in my makeup application becoming more polished and precise.</li>
    <li> Actually I did not like it. I gave it to  my Daughter. I thought is was not long enough, I did not like you could not adjust the light.</li>
    <li> This is great..magnifies great, sturdy and the lighting is ok..not really lit brightly but does the job...hard plastic doesn&#x27;t look expensive but for the price, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be expensive looking, and it&#x27;s not..but for the price, this works very well</li>
    <li> This is well made, the lighting is effective and I like the 5x magnification better than 10x because I can still see my (enlarged) face.  Not flattering, but great for plucking.  I bought this because it is lighter than most.  The travel/lighted mirrors did not get good reviews.  I&#x27;m going to take it on vacation, we&#x27;ll see how it travels!  I only gave it four stars because the design would have been better if you could set it on either of 2 ends (like picture frames).  As it sits, it&#x27;s too low to use, so it will have to be propped.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVED this mirror, but after about a month the lights on one side started blinking off an on - mostly off.  Returned and ordered another one from another site, and it did the same thing after a month of use.  I was so disappointed because I really loved this mirror!  Keep thinking I will try a third one, thinking third time a charm, but have decided not to.  Wonder if anyone else has had this problem.</li>
    <li> I will say this, the mirror does work and the lights are very bright and it is adjustable. I have 52 year old eyes and I can see well enough to pluck out those unwanted hairs easily, which is the reason I bought it, so I am very happy with it. It does the job, that is why I am giving this four stars. On the flip side, it is made out of very cheap plastic, reminds me of a child&#x27;s toy. When I&#x27;m not using it I put it back in the box and put it away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this for the price. It is bright white--so think facial type mirror. The mirror is smallish--so if you are used to the old school office, day, night, home mirror size, this might be too small for you.</li>
    <li> Really cute. Not too big and fits perfectly on my makeup station. I love it.</li>
    <li> Sent it back.  Too small and lights were not in right place.  Did not work right for me.</li>
    <li> This product looks great online, but I am experiencing a flicker in the bulbs as well as some other people noted - after only a few weeks.  It is a nice size, and the mirror is nice, but it is also somewhat cheaply made.  Not sure what I expected for the price, but given that it is made overseas, the quality is lacking in my opinion.</li>
    <li> No matter who you are you will look like you have been dead for several,years in this light!!!</li>
    <li> I really wished this mirror had worked!  The mirror leaves you distorted looking, therefore it is hard to put your make up on!!  The lighting works great and great size for travel but with the bad mirror I will not be using so I can&#x27;t recommend.  The product did arrive on time.</li>
    <li> So after a whopping month of use, the LED bulbs on one side failed and the mirror is useless.</li>
    <li> Great light,came quickly!!</li>
    <li> It works fine.  There is only one light on it meaning, I used to have one that had office lighting, day lighting, and evening lighting.  This is just one light but it works fine.  I really like the magnifying for doing my eyes since I can no longer see doing my eye makeup in a regular mirror.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, lighting and size are perfect.  Good magnification.</li>
    <li> Really bright! An I like how the flip side is magnified!</li>
    <li> Great light, nice quality.  The only negative is that it sits kind of low on my table, but it is totally workable.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mirror. Love the double side mirror with wonderful lighting! Love that it takes batteries along with being plugged into the wall. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I contacted the company after having problems with the lights on one side repeated blinking.  They were extremely helpful and have sent me a new mirror.  I love the mirror and am very happy now with the product.&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, had the replacement mirror only six months and repeated blinking started on this one. I would never buy these mirrors again, even though, when working, I thought it was a wonderful product.  I think they have problems in manufacturing for this recurring blinking to be reported so often.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what my wife has need</li>
    <li> Great light! Very Bright white light..</li>
    <li> This mirror functioned fine for 4 months then the lights on one side started flickering. I tried taking it apart to see if there were loose wires but could find nothing that looked out of place. Pretty bummed that I got the defective one. Won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fair size for home use, definelty too big for travel. I like the battery option, the light can be a bit on the bright side but overall good mirror for the cost.</li>
    <li> Wife put her &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34;mirror away in the closet,tells me something.</li>
    <li> Love love love this mirror. Perfect size for my personal use.</li>
    <li> Perfect size with great magnification.  Very pleased and a good price!</li>
    <li> I was well pleased with this mirror and bought two of them. Very bright in fact the best makeup mirror I ever had. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this light! Perfect for putting on my makeup.</li>
    <li> Does not look so TINY online.  It&#x27;s very small for the price and there is only one selection for the light - it&#x27;s like high beams on a car.</li>
    <li> I ordered this makeup mirror based on multiple positive reviews. However, it was a lot smaller than I expected and the actual mirror was tiny and distorted my reflection. The lighting was unnatural and failry dim. Had to return it right away.</li>
    <li> I really love this mirror BUT I bought it in June and it no longer works 6 weeks later.  It is past the return date.  I am going to order another but will give a very poor review if the second one stops working this soon after purchasing!</li>
    <li> Love this makeup mirror!!  Uses batteries or plugs in and gives plenty of light!  (Great for tweezing.).&lt;br /&gt;I popped some batteries in it and brought it on a cruise and it worked great!  Only downfall is everyone wants to use it at the same time!  :)</li>
    <li> I am giving this a 5 even though I have sent it back.  The mirror works great; however, I have photophobia and the lights are so bright it hurts my eyes.  I have read some reviews about the brightness.  Anyone wants a bright mirror, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> This is okay. Nothing wrong with it...just smaller than I wanted...</li>
    <li> Works well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> The lighting is very blue/white....</li>
    <li> I needed this for business travel because it was so compact. I use the full-sized version Jerdon mirror at home and I love it (the one with all the bells and whistles)! The travel version is better than nothing, however, the lights are so bright, you can&#x27;t really see what you&#x27;re doing because you&#x27;re blinded. I&#x27;m not in love with this one, but I&#x27;ll keep it for the convenience of not having to pack the full sized version, and for not having to stand in a hotel bathroom mirror, trying to put on make-up and dry my hair.</li>
    <li> Magnifying mirror is distorted</li>
    <li> Prefect for a bed boind person or travel. Bright, sturdy, works great</li>
    <li> Excellent product; timely delivery!</li>
    <li> Bright light.  I could probably use this mirror even if the rest of the room was completely dark.  This is exactly what I wanted. I love that it can run on batteries and is travel friendly as well.&lt;br /&gt;The light is not FLATTERING... it shows you every flaw - every blemish! But allows you to see what you NEED to be able to see.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and light is very bright but it just a bit smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> Great makeup mirror. Super bright, white lights. Light &amp; portable. Love that it can run on batteries too. It&#x27;s not overly big, but will serve its purpose good.  Compared to my previous makeup mirror this thing is small &amp; unobtrusive on my counter, which I like.  I do wish it had maybe a high &amp; low setting but overall I do prefer the brightness of the LED lights over the softer lights in the other version.</li>
    <li> Very bright. Takes up little room on my desk.</li>
    <li> THe lighting was off and I like a more yellow tone light, however, I can see it would work for someone, just not me</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift. By all accounts it does the job well.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Simple. Helpful.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this mirror for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> Squeal!!!!!! I love this mirror !! My house is dark, and I have been looking for a small, portable lighted mirror with a plug! I have found it!! It is not big and bulky and take up too much room, but it more than does its job! It was well packaged and shipped fast! I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I will recommend this mirror to my sisters and friends gladly!!!</li>
    <li> Mirror works perfect! I love how bright the lights are and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have to be plugged into an outlet for you to use and you can use batteries instead. My order shipped a lot sooner than I expected so I recieved the product in a short amount of time. I love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely bright. Will leave u a little light blinded if you use it for too long. As if you&#x27;ve been photo flashed.</li>
    <li> Good light but the mirror is a little small.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed,  I bought this for my granddaughter, its a little on the small side, only one setting - super bright.  Wish I had paid a little more for one that gave you different settings and was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> I have used a Jerdon wall lighted mirror before so when looking for a table lighted mirror I looked to that brand.  Very happy with it.  It is well lit and the magnifying amount is perfect, and the price is good also.</li>
    <li> For the price, this mirror is great. I did a lot of research to find a well lit mirror and this one is a keeper. I wish it were a little bigger and the 5x side seems a bit distorted compared to other magnifying mirrors. Overall it is worth it for the price!!</li>
    <li> works great, best mirror ever wife loved it</li>
    <li> This mirror is almost perfect! The light is bright and definitely allows you to see any and all imperfections. I was slightly frightened when I first looked at myself, especially in the 5x magnification. BUT that&#x27;s the whole point - to see what you&#x27;re doing and where you&#x27;re actually putting makeup, and the places you may have missed. This mirror is really going to come in handy, especially because my bathroom has such poor lighting.. not to mention a yellow-ish glow so this mirror is GREAT fix for bad lighting! It works well. It isn&#x27;t too big or too small (in my opinion) and I have a very tiny bathroom. It can be easily stored. The power-cord is long enough to move it around if necessary. I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s way better than I expected! I do wish there were more lighting options, so I don&#x27;t nearly blind myself in the morning when I&#x27;m first putting on makeup, but overall I&#x27;m excited and happy and I absolutely LOVE it!!! I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended this mirror to ANYONE that needs something compact that packs a great punch. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I rarely use this mirror. I bought it because they said it was the brightest on the market...and it is! But that is the problem. It&#x27;s actually TOO bright. When applying eyeshadow it completely washes my face out and you can&#x27;t tell that any color has been applied...so you keep adding color and when you turn the light off you realize you look like Mimi from the Drew Carey show.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but felt compelled to warn potential customers about this product.  It broke within the first 6 months and after extensive correspondence with the company, was forced to go to Amazon Prime for a solution.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I wish it had different settings. Good price</li>
    <li> This mirror is awesome! It is smaller than I had expected, but it does the job. It&#x27;s great that it runs off of batteries or with electric. The light is very bright and doesn&#x27;t put off any heat. I love it and would order 10 more if I could!</li>
    <li> MAGNIFICATION ASPECT IS NOT CLEAR. OTHER THAN THAT, GOOD BUY AND WELL CONSTRUCTED.</li>
    <li> I Love it but it is really bright.</li>
    <li> I love my makeup mirror and take it with me when I travel.  I don&#x27;t like the lighting much (too dim and unnatural lighting) but I use the mirror every day.</li>
    <li> Initially, I loved this mirror. The lighting was great and it was exactly what I needed... For 3 months. The mirror swivel no longer stays in a functional position and now the lights on the right side flicker on and off to the point where it&#x27;s impossible to use. Only buy this mirror if you need it for a few months!</li>
    <li> Within 30 days of purchase the lights began flickering badly and the mirror became useless as a lighted mirror.  Tried returning via Amazon and was unable due to the 30 day policy (I had it for about 40 days)  Have since contacted Amazon customer service and they made an exception and emailed me a return label.  My mirror may just have been a rare defective one, but you should make sure to return within 30 days if it starts to flicker, because it just got worse and worse until it was actually flashing!  I requested a refund, not a replacement.</li>
    <li> A nice mirror basically, but the lights were too bright for my eyes, and the magnification was too strong.  I returned the product and received very good customer service.</li>
    <li> This mirror is very nice quality. It is the perfect size to fit wherever you might want it.</li>
    <li> Much brighter light than the last two mirrors I used. Compact. Easy to set up. Stable in most locations. With the magnification and the bright light I found many more hairs to remove.</li>
    <li> Very nice for a travel mirror.  Light are bright and the magnification is great.</li>
    <li> The lights are way too bright.  I would appreciate a selection knob so I could use all the lights or some of the lights.</li>
    <li> Great, now I can see what make up I am wearing! Perfect!</li>
    <li> Fits the need for a 91 year old lady</li>
    <li> great mirror-love the 5x magnification and the LED lighting is perfect! I looked at soo many makeup mirrors and read reviews...this was the&lt;br /&gt;right choice for me and the price was very reasonable. Would highly recommend this makeup mirror for general makeup to tweezing eye&lt;br /&gt;brows-you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> Light too glaring. Not natural.</li>
    <li> Highly functional.  Battery powered lights is a great feature.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror! It&#x27;s so much easier to see without repositioning a light all the time. The light is super bright and either can be used with batteries or a plug. My mom loves it so much , that she&#x27;s buying one herself!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: i have owned this mirror for 2 months now and the 2 bulbs on the right hand saide have started to simultaneously blink quickly, like a strobe light. It stops when i unplug the power cord, but then the clear bright whiteness of the light dulls to a dimmer hue. Looks like im back in the market for a new makeup mirroe.  Great mirror. Clear bright light and great magnification on back mirror. Small enough to travel with but large enough to use at my makeup table.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too small but it is very bright and easy to story or carry on trips.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality.  I like it so much that I&#x27;m buying my daughter one now!!</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a gift for a family member.  It was ultimately returned without opening, since the intended receiver of the gift had already purchased a similar item on their own.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to being able to have a makeup mirror that didn&#x27;t have to use a cord. The trade-off, however, was a garish, blue-white light that is horribly unflattering. NOT what I wanted in a makeup mirror. The corded mirror I had was from Sally Beauty and offered a warm, soft light with settings for different environments - office, daylight, etc. This Jerdon mirror was just horrible. I lit it up once, looked into it, packed it up and sent it back.</li>
    <li> Smallish, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my niece&#x27;s 16th birthday. We gave it on the recommendation of my 16 year old daughter, who&#x27;s had the same one for 3 years, and LOVES it. Haven&#x27;t heard yet what my niece thinks, but my daughter finds hers indispensable. She recently forgot it when she stayed overnight at a friend&#x27;s house (has cord and batteries, so it&#x27;s very portable), and later told me how hard it was to try to do her makeup with a regular bathroom mirror/light. Ah, the hardship! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror has 2 magnifications (1x and 5x) and flips easily. The soft white lighting is plenty bright. Years ago, we had a makeup mirror that had day/night/office settings to mimic sunlight, fluorescent, incandescent, etc., which seemed handy. But my daughter seems very content with the single neutral lighting option. :)</li>
    <li> The lighted mirror is nice, but not quite enough light.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs. Nice bright lights and great magnification.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning.  I wish the light was brighter.  The bulbs are like soft white.  It does the trick.</li>
    <li> The lighting is very bright. I kinda wish it had a dimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my wife because her old mirror didn&#x27;t light up enough and was a bit small.  This one is large,  doesn&#x27;t fall over easily at all and the lights are nice and bright. I also like that it gives you the option to work with either a plug in adaptor or with batteries.  The only complaint she had was that she may need sunglasses to apply her makeup lol</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I was looking for! Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> I saw this posted on Facebook, another gal was contemplating buying this, so I had to check. Well my report back is to tell you that this is the most PERFECT lighted make up mirror ever. It is perfect for me, for one, it is portable with batteries, if it can go with me, then it&#x27;s already a winner. Secondly, I love the fact that I can adjust it to my needs, and get a very close look at my face, when all this time I have been applying make up in the Dark ages. It was like an ah-ha moment....I can finally see what I am doing and what I should have been doing all this time. Is this product worth the price, absolutely. Matter of fact, I think this is a steal. While I did receive a discount in exchange for this review, I would have no problem paying the full price because it is so well made, durable, movable and provides excellent light to address my beauty needs in full. I anticipate it will last a long time, and this is definitely an item that I will be buying my daughters, so they may know the awesomeness of this product. LOVE!!</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product. I spent HOURS reading reviews on LED make up mirrors and this seemed to get the best reviews even though people said it wasn&#x27;t as big as they thought, which it&#x27;s not but the size is manageable, the 5x side is not that great and it&#x27;s not but doable and a lot of them said the lights stopped working...and they do. I have had this mirror 5 weeks and the right side lights stopped working and now they flash like disco lights. I thought I would get lucky and not end up like many of the other reviewers but no. I also cannot get in touch with Amazon to see if they will exchange or not. I&#x27;m really disappointed in the maker of this product and for the first time, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror when my old faithful mirror died.  This one is too short for me.  I have to put it on top of a folded towel on my vanity top and I still cannot see as well as I could on my larger mirror.  It is battery operated (and corded), so I will probably stick it away for an extra mirror for traveling.</li>
    <li> Mirror was as I hoped it would be - good lighting and magnification.</li>
    <li> Love using it. I can see my face clearly when applying make up. One light on the top left blinks for 3 seconds after i plugged it in but then it stopped. Overall good purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the lighting! No more &amp;#34;I missed a spot&amp;#34; moments!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it and it gives off lots of light. Almost need sunglasses to us!</li>
    <li> Absolutely what I wanted.  It is bright, white--the perfect illumination and magnification.  My old one (manufactured as Mirror-Go-Lightly in 1968) had a larger mirror that I liked, but this one is sufficient in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord on my Mirror-Go-Lightly (now 44 years old!) has been repaired with electrical tape, by ten years ago it had become extremely difficult to find replacement bulbs, and now I was down to 2 bulbs working.  Worse, its higher powered mirror was 3X magnification but my eyes no longer can see details well, even with that.  Retails only had 10X (waaay too difficult to see with) or the lights were so poor I might as well be burning a match.  I thought I&#x27;d have to get flip-up glasses &amp; didn&#x27;t have much confidence that they&#x27;d be what I could use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a lark, I searched Amazon for \\&quot;Mirror-Go-Lightly.  Lo!  Jerdon came up, had a 5X magnification, and I was SAVED.  I am one happy camper.  Once more I can do my make-up well, the first time in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am so elated!</li>
    <li> The best mirror  I have had to date. Lighting is very good, and magnifying side shows more than I care to see!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the right size, does the right thing, and is just what I want for home and travel.</li>
    <li> great litlle mirror, love it</li>
    <li> love this mirror.Now I can see to put makeup on.</li>
    <li> I took this mirror with me on vacation and it worked great.  It has the battery option which turned out to work best.  You can use it anyplace if you can&#x27;t get close to the electrical outlet.</li>
    <li> did&#x27;nt care for the lighting and mirror</li>
    <li> I have a very dark bathroom with only overhead lighting so I needed a mirror that put out a lot of light. This one does well. I also did not want to mess with a power cord, but this one has the nice option of using either batteries or the included, detachable power cord. The mirror is a good size, clear, and easily flips from the non-magnified to the magnified side. I have had the mirror for a month now and have not had to change the batteries yet, so it seems to have good battery life.</li>
    <li> I bought for my wife. She loves the size and brightness and being able to run it off batteries.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very helpful! I use it for make up &amp; my eyebrows, it also has the extra size to see closer! I think the lights are great as well! couldn&#x27;t be any happier! I love the fact that you can use the wall outlet if you&#x27;re close to it &amp; use batteries if you&#x27;re traveling! :)</li>
    <li> These lights are BRIGHT. Like, &amp;#34;holy cow do I really look like that&amp;#34; bright. Helps with the makeup blending though.</li>
    <li> Good size, nice lighting. Recommend</li>
    <li> Not as bright as I expected, but still works nice</li>
    <li> Super bright little vanity mirror.  Both the regular and magnified mirrors are clear and not distorted.  Good for seeing things you may miss in the bathroom mirror or in a mirror with inferior lighting.  Quality and price 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this Battery powered LED lighted makeup Mirror. It&#x27;s a drag putting on makeup in hotel rooms, camping and such, but with this sweet item no matter where you are you can always look perfect!</li>
    <li> Liked it so much I ordered one for my daughter</li>
    <li> Very happy with this mirror. It&#x27;s VERY bright!  But I&#x27;m able to see my eyes clearly in the dimly lit dining room when I&#x27;m not able to put makeup on in the bathroom.  I definitely recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> Enjoying this well-lit addition to my vanity.</li>
    <li> Out of the box, the Jerdon LED mirror has clean lines and works just as it says.  It has 4 LED bulbs with diffusers and comes with an AC source or can be operated with AA batteries.  It is billed as a travel mirror, however, it is size prohibitive.  The mirror and the 5x mirror are clear with minimal distortion.  The adjustable stand on the back is sturdy and allows for a range of placement. I do think it is a bit bulky, especially since LED lights are so small.  It is not heavy, just bulky.  The light is bright white, not blue or yellow.  It does light up all the imperfections in skin so for this reason, it does the job.  Overall, this mirror is just what I needed to do eyebrows or fine makeup application.  The on/off is an easy switch, right in the front.  The mirror swivels easily.  I rated it 4 stars since I was hoping to set it on my sink edge but it is just a bit to big to do that.  I will have to use it on another surface.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great quality. works great.</li>
    <li> The LED is plenty bright. The mirror&#x27;s are perfect size.  Compact great for travel. The batteries option is a big plus and should last along time as these are LED&#x27;s. The only con is that the power supply has a rather short power cord, at least for my application .Overall I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I already own a Jerdon fluorescent 5x mirror that I am very happy with and was hoping to replace it with something more light weight and mobile.  Unfortunately, this mirror was so distorted that I had to return it.  I also noticed that it would be next to impossible to change the bulbs should they burn out, so once the bulbs are gone, the mirror would be useless.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a mirror that I could prop up with a stand, and just couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere.  My husband actually found this one while shopping on your website.  It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I was going back and forth between a few different mirrors and am so happy I chose this one! The lights are very bright, but not so bright that they kill my eyes. It has a very smooth 360 rotation between mirrors. The magnification side is distorted, but if you lean in it works perfectly. I&#x27;ve used it every day for 2 or 3 weeks now and hope the bulbs last for quite some time because I love it! I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Here is a list of mirror&#x27;s that I have bought and returned in search of the perfect travel makeup mirror and just plane makeup mirror: Simple Human 5X magnification mirror, Simple Human 10X magnification mirror with travel box, Zadro Next Generation 1X/10X Next Generation LED lighted Travel Mirror ULT 111, S Tri Fold Lighted Mirror with 3 panels for cosmetic application, and on and on and on. This mirror is the best out there -- trust me. Yes, the bulbs are exposed, (that is a con), but, they are deep with in the mirror, so they will not break easily. I kept the box for travel purposes, so I can easily pack it in my carry on.  The size, for me is perfect. It&#x27;s also very light weight, despite being about the size of a Macbook Air. Mine came with the power adapter, however, if you don&#x27;t want to pack that, you can use 4 AA batteries and it really doesn&#x27;t make the mirror feel any heavier. BUT, the LED light is so much brighter when you plug the light in. I mean, I bought this mirror mainly for travel, so at first I just used it with the batteries and loved it. I thought the light was so bright, then my husband said I should really use the power adapter if I was going to start using it at home. When I plugged it in --- WOW- what a difference. As an experiment, I used the mirror in the pitch black dark with the LED lights as my only lighting, using the power adapter and my makeup came out looking great. Another con is the cheap, white plastic way it looks. I suppose that adds to it&#x27;s weightlessness. It does remind me of something you would see Jennifer Lawrence&#x27;s character using in that movie American Hustle :(  -- but what could I expect for $37 with Prime Shipping?  The normal mirror is perfect. The 5X is a bit wobbly, however, if you look at it a bit closer, the image is clearer and works great for eyebrows and mascara, etc. The power adapter is also dual voltage, so you can take it with you to Europe if you want ( for those that travel). The staff at Simple Human should have taken some cues from this under $40 mirror before creating that $200 useless mirror. I mean what &amp;#34;Simple Human&amp;#34; needs a 5X magnification mirror that costs $200 anyway?  Um.......hopefully the bulbs will last in this Jerdon mirror. I guess we&#x27;ll see.  UPDATE!! January 2016 -- I STILL LOVE THIS MIRROR. I  bought another one to keep with me in NY since I travel so much from NY to LA. When I was in Paris, the battery portion of this mirror saved me since the outlet in the hotel didn&#x27;t work very well. I ended up using the battery in Amsterdam as well. Love this plastic mirror with BRIGHT A@$ LIGHTING.  UPDATE!!! October 4th, 2016 and I STILL LOVE THIS MIRROR!! The lights are still bright. I just took it with me to Turks and Cacos last summer (can&#x27;t spell that, sorry) and I don&#x27;t leave home for a trip with out it. I have an at home vanity table that I don&#x27;t use because I take this mirror down to the kitchen table, turn it on and love it enough to place a third update!!!!! I may buy 2 more in case it gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mirror.  It&#x27;s light and portable.  The battery option is what sold me.  For the money, you can&#x27;t beat it! *update:  the lights on this didn&#x27;t last .</li>
    <li> not happy with this purchase at all.  I would return it but original box is destroyed.  mirror is distorted I would not reccommend this product at all</li>
    <li> the lighting is great,magnification not so much. it is small but i am using it..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a small, functional makeup mirror, perfect for a small space. Illuminates nicely. Worth the $$.</li>
    <li> Just received this mirror on 7/7/14 and was pleasantly surprised on the quality of it. The lights on the side are very bright&lt;br /&gt;but not too much where they interfere with applying makeup. The magnifying side has just enough magnification that is&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t distort any facial features. I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror like this for quite sometime and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a bright lighted mirror to apply makeup and tweeze eyebrows I&#x27;m highly recommending this one.</li>
    <li> First one was a bummer because battery compartment was defective.  Sent back and Amazon replaced almost immediately and this one is perfect. Wife loves it and fact that it has 4 AA battery that allows her to move around without power plug is totally awesome.  She loves it.  Bright, nicely done and very functional (she tells me-I do not use makeup mirror.  Bought it for her and she is totally impressed especially with the mobility and quality of the mirror and lights.  She said to tell you go for it.</li>
    <li> I prefer the one with a socket you can plug in other things and it has three sides which I like better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product based on reviews.  That has usually been a great guide for me.  Unfortunately, it was not the case this time.  While I do agree it is a sturdy mirror with great lighting, I am disappointed in the magnified side.  I have found it to be quite distorted. The outer edges of the mirror are concave on the magnification side, thus the issue I believe.  On the normal side, the mirror is set in the casing relatively flush, thus no distortion.  I would probably return the mirror, but had already disposed of the box and packaging.  I do think it will travel well and hopefully I will adjust to it.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror it&#x27;s like HD so my makeup looks great</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Very portable.  I like the size because I can use it as a &#x27;hand held&#x27; mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a convenient size for travel, but also big enough and sufficient to use daily at home.  I am starting to take more care in applying makeup, and since the lighting in hotels is usually poor, I am looking forward to taking this with me on trips, wrapped in bubble wrap.  It can be plugged in, but I have been using it on battery power.</li>
    <li> Very bright and I love the cool touch bulbs.  Works very well and is the perfect size.  Portability is a plus!</li>
    <li> Nicer than I expected.</li>
    <li> Bought this mainly to use on trips. Perfect size and weight. Love the 5x mirror and bright LED lights.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for applying makeup. It has a regular side and then you can flip it to the magnified side. The lights are nice and bright too. I didn&#x27;t realize it came with an ac adaptor, but it does which is a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for traveling.  The blue light takes a while to get used to but very bright.</li>
    <li> Very small, returning</li>
    <li> The size and magnifying glass are great, but as soon as I turn this sucker on... I&#x27;m blinded!!!! How is one supposed to pluck and groom whilst looking into the sun?!?!</li>
    <li> Very bright to apply make up. Very pleased with it..</li>
    <li> Great light, large enough, love the mirror size on this and it is light weight to pack.</li>
    <li> Love this mirror. The LED lights are much whiter than fluorescent lighted makeup mirrors so it&#x27;s easy to see to apply my makeup. The price was excellent too!</li>
    <li> Love this mirror.  Great light....very bright.</li>
    <li> Has a bright light and I love that it&#x27;s either battery or plug in operated. Easy to move from one place to another.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter-in-law, and when it came I bought two more. I love the light on both sides, and I can adjust the angle of the mirror&#x27;s stand. The price is great. You can&#x27;t judge it by the picture, but it is way more better in 3D. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
