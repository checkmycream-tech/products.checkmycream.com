      <li>great product for pain relief</li>
      <li>I heard great things about Topricin</li>
      <li>She loved it also.</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>It worked amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
      <li>The texture of both is just wonderful and has a nice gentle smell to it</li>
      <li>The pain is the most severe when I am driving home from work.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>This is OK, but my husband tried &amp;#34;SIMPLY KOOL&amp;#34; foot cream on EBAY.</li>
      <li>It works on most aches and pains.  </li>
      <li>Love my Topricin cream?</li>
      <li>I have using Topricin for many years and tell all my friends about it.  </li>
      <li>Was hoping for more</li>
      <li>Recommended to many friends</li>
      <li>It is ok and it did not make my review to the highest.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good price also.  </li>
      <li>My husband excersises, looses weight, and wins instead of losing the Battle!!</li>
      <li>Works GREAT for pain in my back and for arthritic pain/inflammation in a friend&#x27;s hands.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>this really helps with the pain and healing process!</li>
      <li>Rare that I totally endorse a product, this one makes that an easy thing to do.</li>
      <li>A customer bought this product, which I had never heard of, so I investigated it and, based on all the positive reviews, decided to try it.  </li>
      <li>The mild odor dispels quickly and the relief lasts several hours.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased that Topricin has added a product that is especially for the foot, since I have been using the standard Topricin for years.</li>
      <li>Really relieves pain and cools the burning in the feet.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t explain that here, as I&#x27;m not at all a believer in homeopathy, but even if you are, it&#x27;s not self-consistent with the whole &amp;#34;like</li>
      <li>She said it really helps with the pain she sometimes gets in her feet.</li>
      <li>It really helps.</li>
      <li>Topricin foot cream did not seem to make much difference in the pain level from plantar fasciitis.  </li>
      <li>The box was retaped shut and the inner seal on the tub of cream was opened and ripped and replaced back on top.  </li>
      <li>The no-odor was our main reason for trying this product and we have used it for years.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>but so far it hasn&#x27;t really worked for the sciatica.  </li>
      <li>Must be used at least 2 times a day to be effective though.</li>
      <li>That right there is the key.....</li>
      <li>topricin foot cream is the only cream that helps my foot pain and allows me to continue with my every day life in a more or less normal manner.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I had been using an arnica-containing product that appeared to be helpful in reducing swelling on an old ankle injury.</li>
      <li>so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.  </li>
      <li>When I apply the cream when I get home, the pain subsides considerably within 10 minutes.  </li>
      <li>While it was my fault for not noticing the product was homeopathic when purchasing, the presence of arnica isn&#x27;t even consistent with homeopathic &amp;#34;theory&amp;#34;, as arnica is known for the same medicinal effects when it&#x27;s actually used (as opposed to its nonexistent presence in homeopathy).</li>
      <li>but it proved to be no more effective than any other topical ointment I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
      <li>Not sure why there is a special foot</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also suffering from pretty intense sciatica pain and have been rubbing some into the small of my back,</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for relief for real pain and swelling, and like me missed that this is homeopathic product, I advise instead looking at some products containing actual active ingredients.</li>

<li> I got the product I found I received a completely odorless substance (which I found odd)</li>
<li> One of the few things that brings some relief to a 91 year old woman with RA.</li>
<li> Same as other like products.</li>
<li> Not sure I would order two different kinds in the future.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Really I think this is a one-star product, but I&#x27;m giving it a second star is only because it&#x27;s harmless, because it was my mistake for accidentally purchasing a homeopathic product, and because the company at least honored their money-back guarantee.</li>
<li> I have severe burning neuropathy of my feet due to chemotherapy and believe me I have tried everything.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a cashier at the drugstore chain and found standing on my feet after 30 years at a desk job to be painful,  particularly since I developed a bunion.  </li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
<li> Works on relieving pain within a few minutes and lasts two to four hours.  </li>
<li> The shipping was a little slow</li>
<li> I do think it may be helping, at LEAST, it helps and</li>
<li> This product penetrates deeply to ease my muscles and aches without giving off unpleasant fumes as some products do when containing menthol.</li>
<li> Looking for a less expensive option, I saw this product had arnica as an &amp;#34;ingredient&amp;#34; and decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I put a little on every morning and evening and while I may get a stabbing pain every now and then, this cream is a miracle.  </li>
<li> From sports injuries to broken bones....</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that doesn&#x27;t have all the chemical crap, look no further.</li>
<li> Seriously!</li>
<li> Optician definitely helped with my wife&#x27;s painful toe!</li>
<li> but I found it completely useless for pain relief.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and quites the skin.</li>
<li> I have arthritis in my feet which makes walking very painful.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>
<li> My feet still hurt and sometimes real bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you need this product you probably know why I bought it. IT WORKS! Buy with confidence</li>
    <li> Rare that I totally endorse a product, this one makes that an easy thing to do.</li>
    <li> Works on relieving pain within a few minutes and lasts two to four hours.  The no-odor was our main reason for trying this product and we have used it for years.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;5 star review, My Husband has nerve damage in his leg, Dr&#x27;s said nothing would help. This cream helped immensely!  Love my Topricin cream? YES! I do think it may be helping, at LEAST, it helps and My husband excersises, looses weight, and wins instead of losing the Battle!! Love! Seriously!</li>
    <li> This product penetrates deeply to ease my muscles and aches without giving off unpleasant fumes as some products do when containing menthol. The mild odor dispels quickly and the relief lasts several hours.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!!!!!  I&#x27;m a cashier at the drugstore chain and found standing on my feet after 30 years at a desk job to be painful,  particularly since I developed a bunion.  Different shoes also impacted the pain I felt from this bunion.  A customer bought this product, which I had never heard of, so I investigated it and, based on all the positive reviews, decided to try it.  Within three days the pain from my bunion disappeared.  I put a little on every morning and evening and while I may get a stabbing pain every now and then, this cream is a miracle.  I&#x27;m also suffering from pretty intense sciatica pain and have been rubbing some into the small of my back, but so far it hasn&#x27;t really worked for the sciatica.  I hurt my wrist one day at work and rubbed some on it after work; the next day I had no pain.  I don&#x27;t know if it w-/ a coincidence or the cream but will try this cream on all body parts that hurt.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT for pain in my back and for arthritic pain/inflammation in a friend&#x27;s hands.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff.  Recommended to many friends and they say the same. Went to a dance camp with 500 people, this was the only remedy for muscle and joint pain.  It works.</li>
    <li> I purchase this foot cream for my mom who is diabetic. She said it really helps with the pain she sometimes gets in her feet.</li>
    <li> Not sure why there is a special foot Topricin but I had received some samples and it relieved my foot pain so I ordered it.  Not sure I would order two different kinds in the future.  I think the regular Topricin would do the trick.  It works to relieve pain and aches.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Repeated Customer.  I absolutely love this product. I used it for back pain. Nerve pain, on my face, after shingles, and also let my mom use it, after she broke her leg. She loved it also. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and quites the skin.</li>
    <li> Optician definitely helped with my wife&#x27;s painful toe!</li>
    <li> This is OK, but my husband tried &amp;#34;SIMPLY KOOL&amp;#34; foot cream on EBAY. Really relieves pain and cools the burning in the feet. Pretty good price also.  Put &amp;#34;Simply Kool&amp;#34; in the EBAY search.  You will see a white jar with a blue label.  My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought this to help relieve pain in my arches.  It worked amazingly well.  So, I shared it with the dance teachers at our local dance studio...they are now all Topricin believers, too!</li>
    <li> topricin foot cream is the only cream that helps my foot pain and allows me to continue with my every day life in a more or less normal manner.</li>
    <li> I had heard a lot of people praise this product.  I purchases both the foot and the regular creams.  The texture of both is just wonderful and has a nice gentle smell to it but I found it completely useless for pain relief.  I have never responded to homeopathic products so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.  I&#x27;ll just use it as a regular cream so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
    <li> Have ordered this product before and it performs well.  However, the seller of this product sold me an open USED product.  The box was retaped shut and the inner seal on the tub of cream was opened and ripped and replaced back on top.  Very disappointed.  Would not order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had been using an arnica-containing product that appeared to be helpful in reducing swelling on an old ankle injury. Looking for a less expensive option, I saw this product had arnica as an &amp;#34;ingredient&amp;#34; and decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the product I found I received a completely odorless substance (which I found odd) and then that had zero effect after using it a week. Having a second look at the tub, I saw the &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; are actually in homoepathic &amp;#34;doses&amp;#34; (basically, non-existent). No wonder it wasn&#x27;t helping! While it was my fault for not noticing the product was homeopathic when purchasing, the presence of arnica isn&#x27;t even consistent with homeopathic &amp;#34;theory&amp;#34;, as arnica is known for the same medicinal effects when it&#x27;s actually used (as opposed to its nonexistent presence in homeopathy). I won&#x27;t explain that here, as I&#x27;m not at all a believer in homeopathy, but even if you are, it&#x27;s not self-consistent with the whole &amp;#34;like cures like&amp;#34; stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really I think this is a one-star product, but I&#x27;m giving it a second star is only because it&#x27;s harmless, because it was my mistake for accidentally purchasing a homeopathic product, and because the company at least honored their money-back guarantee. But if you are looking for relief for real pain and swelling, and like me missed that this is homeopathic product, I advise instead looking at some products containing actual active ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have sprained my ankle month ago, and I started using this cream since than but, cant see any result. hope it helps, cause ankle still hurts</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom who gets gout, she used it and the pain went away, good product and excellent price.  The shipping was a little slow</li>
    <li> One of the few things that brings some relief to a 91 year old woman with RA.</li>
    <li> I heard great things about Topricin but it proved to be no more effective than any other topical ointment I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me or my mom.</li>
    <li> I have arthritis in my feet which makes walking very painful.  I find that this cream does actually help relieve the pain even though it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it.  Must be used at least 2 times a day to be effective though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. If you&#x27;re looking for something that doesn&#x27;t have all the chemical crap, look no further. From sports injuries to broken bones....this really helps with the pain and healing process! That right there is the key.....HELPS IN HEALING!</li>
    <li> Topricin has helped with my chronic planters fasciitis and tarsal tunnel syndrome. I use it 3 times a day, and when the pain is especially severe. The cream will reduce the pain instantly after rubbing it in. I am very pleased that Topricin has added a product that is especially for the foot, since I have been using the standard Topricin for years.</li>
    <li> I have severe burning neuropathy of my feet due to chemotherapy and believe me I have tried everything.  The pain is the most severe when I am driving home from work.  When I apply the cream when I get home, the pain subsides considerably within 10 minutes.  I am a physician and I recommend it to my patients.</li>
    <li> It is ok and it did not make my review to the highest.  My feet still hurt and sometimes real bad.  I had wanted the cream to stop the hurting fell short.</li>
    <li> Topricin foot cream did not seem to make much difference in the pain level from plantar fasciitis.  Was hoping for more</li>
    <li> I just started using the foot therapy cream and it has helped.  I have using Topricin for many years and tell all my friends about it.  It really helps.</li>
    <li> My sister introduced me to Topricin.  It works on most aches and pains.  I recommend it to EVERYONE.  It has no medicine smell which I like.</li>
    <li> This homeopathic cream is soothing on my ankle, which was diagnosed several months ago with inflammation.  When I use it regularly -- in morning and evening -- it definitely helps to alleviate the pain.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have plantars, and this seems to help I will ofder this item again. I hav recomended this to my friends.</li>
    <li> No relief for plantar fasciitis</li>
    <li> Same as other like products.</li>
    <li> great product for pain relief</li>
</ol>
