      <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
      <li>thanks b</li>
      <li>Works really well on relaxed edges but tends to get greasy after its set on hair for awhile.  </li>
      <li>I notice even better results when my hair is slightly damp and it has helped my edges to grow as well.  </li>

      <li>My hair stayed soft &amp; the bun lasted for a week.</li>
      <li>However, I noticed that the texture and appearance is totally different from the previous ones purchased not through Amazon which is most likely why it does not slick or straighten my edges which is the desired result.</li>
      <li>I love this Pomade, it does what it says, however it will look a little ashy or white when I use it the second or third day</li>
      <li>This is the only product that works quick when applied and last longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Be careful of using too much product.</li>

    <li> Had it applied to my hair at a hair show so I bought it.</li>

    <li> I like this stuff, even though it does not last all day for me.</li>
    <li> I been using this for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> love the product! one of the containers was broken when i received it...they should have packed it better.</li>
    <li> I wanted to look for this because other gels cake up and this one is really hard to find, but once again Amazon comes through.  I found this and had to get a couple of them.  I got them in just days after I ordered them.  Thanks Amazon.  Excellent product and delivery service.</li>
    <li> This Best at temp straighten and holding ! A must have for styling! I use this daily on my hair as well as my daughters</li>
    <li> Great product! Not very oily like other brands.</li>
    <li> This is a life saver for my edges....wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Tames edges without flaking or residue. I am a repeat customer of this product and highly recommend this wonderful hair care item!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now. It&#x27;s expensive but to me it&#x27;s worth it. I like buying 2 at a time since I use it every day. This is the only product that works quick when applied and last longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is relaxed so it may work better with relaxed hair than virgin hair. But even with relaxed hair not all edgers work. Now I only use it for my front edges. I do not use it for upsweep hair styles. You will need a stronger gel for that. In my opinion, if you just want your edges to look smoother when you pull your hair back in a ponytail, then this product will do the job. Your edges will be straight and smooth for hours.</li>
    <li> I have used other products in the past, but Edges does it for me. My edges lay down and stays for an entire day. Another benefit is that it smells and feels good.</li>
    <li> Great product for laying down African American textured hair!! It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like, but it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Works really well on relaxed edges but tends to get greasy after its set on hair for awhile.  It holds natural hair as well and doesn&#x27;t curl up a as quick as other edge controllers. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this Pomade, it does what it says, however it will look a little ashy or white when I use it the second or third day, I just wet  a.wash cloth with warm water and wipe around my hair line in the front where I used the product and then reapply it. That way I don&#x27;t have to shampoo my hair too often. I like it so much that I have ordered two more, one for my self as a back up, and one for my daughter, she loves it too, it really holds down our edges nicely. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using this on her hair. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t seem to attract the dust and dirt that some of the other products tend to hold in your hair.</li>
    <li> I use this product to slick my edges. This was my go to product for over four years. I have coarse, thick hair (not chemically straightened) and this product usually does wonders in slicking my edges without the need of heat application. However, I noticed that the texture and appearance is totally different from the previous ones purchased not through Amazon which is most likely why it does not slick or straighten my edges which is the desired result. I tend to get undesired results with every application (e.g., white flaky build up and coarse edges). I am truly upset that I have two containers of this product that do not work. I will not be purchasing again. I would love to hear others&#x27; comments about this product and whether or not they share my experience!</li>
    <li> I have been using Hick&#x27;s edges for a few years now. I love it! It tames the edges. You can get some buildup, but that&#x27;s usually after a few applications, and it goes away if you add some water and tie down edges with a scarf.</li>
    <li> favorite edge control !!!!!!!!!</li>
