      <li>I love this lip liner, it is so natural looking if you have pigmented lips already!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a little lighter than I needed but a great liner</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
      <li>My lips have a tendency to dry out with most products, but this is creamy, goes on smoothly, and lasts for some time.</li>

      <li>I will definitely be buying more of these.</li>

      <li>More brown than expected but five stars otherwise.</li>
      <li>The color is very rich and lasts through eating or drinking (carefully).</li>
      <li>Such a great color for a slight natural look.</li>
      <li>Frequently used as a dupe of higher priced name brands.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips.</li>
      <li>I use this more then my covergirl, sephora, wet n wild, and MAC liners.</li>
      <li>, i highly recommend this pencil</li>
      <li>Just like MAC Lip Whirl Liner for less! :)</li>
      <li>Only issue, both are a bit drying, so load up on the Zum lip balm first.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and last surprisingly long for the price.</li>
      <li>Love the color but the liner is so dry and rough.</li>
      <li>I often wear it with just a clear gloss.</li>
      <li>Its close to my natural color, so I wear it basically every day.</li>
