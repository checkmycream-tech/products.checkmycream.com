      <li>Much better!</li>

      <li>Very strong.  </li>
      <li>Repellents should work in theory, but in practice old fashioned traps, and plugging the openings still seems to be the best.  </li>
      <li>If you have a wood stove and put some in your cast iron pot to humidify the air, that smells beautifully as well and decongests very well!  </li>
      <li>, compared to Now&#x27;s Peppermint oil, this oil has a very, very weak/faint scent and isn&#x27;t very effective for diffusing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!  This is NOT Peppermint Oil(Mentha piperita) this is Cornmint Oil(MENTHA ARVENSIS) and they seem to have no trouble whatsoever in deceiving potential customers.  Buyer Beware!!!</li>
    <li> This bottle doesn&#x27;t have a strong peppermint smell like the first one I purchased.  I would like for you to send me another bottle to replace this one right away.  I saw a mouse running in my garage and when I used the first bottle I didn&#x27;t have any mice running in mu garage.</li>
    <li> did a mixture and spread for spiders - seems good.</li>
    <li> I make homemade liquid soap and I use this to make it smell great and then my whole house smells like Christmas. a plus is that it repells bugs!!!</li>
    <li> Very good buy ! Exactly what I wanted. Arrived in 3 days after I ordered it,and packed very well !</li>
    <li> AS LISTED AND ADVERTISED ABOVE, I PURCHASED WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE PEPPERMINT OIL (MENTHA PIPERITA)BUT RECEIVED CORNMINT OIL (MENTHA ARVENSIS) INSTEAD . BUYERS BEWARE!!! WONT KEEP RODENTS AWAY.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a deterrent for mice entering our home.  I do like to use any kind of poisons.  So far we have seen fewer mice as the odor is quite strong.  If you don&#x27;t like such an intense scent, I would not recommend this for any use.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes to solve a rat problem getting inside my vehicle. I am not disappointed at all. This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a neighborhood filled with citrus trees, I to have a number of orange / gratefruit trees. Never living near fruit trees. I had no&lt;br /&gt;idea that there are roof-rats. Never heard of them.The damage they have done to my vehicle,thousands of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to say this stuff really works. I also bought the Rodent Defense (awesome) &amp; the fresh cab rodent repellent..&lt;br /&gt;No more rats. Not a one...Patricia  Sun City,AZ</li>
    <li> I have purchased 3 bottles of peppermint oil from various brands. This smells like turpentine. It is stinky, not pleasant like peppermint. This was labeled \\&quot;peppermint\\&quot; but it isn&#x27;t. I wont be buying anything more from this brand.</li>
    <li> Great deal very good product!</li>
    <li> Very good Peppermint. I love it !!! Will be back soon and get more !!!</li>
    <li> Best price and very strong.   Yes it does seem to slightly repel stink bugs, but not that much..  it definitely does not get rid of them.  but the mouse repellent thing seems to be true.</li>
    <li> In our first home, and googled how to get rid of mice.  Our home backs a field and I sprayed our foundation with the oil using a dollar store spray bottle, and it kept mice away all winter.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use for keeping mice out of my home.  It really doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original peppermint oil made form real peppermint.  This product uses corn peppermint oil, has a funny smell and doesn&#x27;t bother the mice.  I put it into my drawers and the smell will knock you out if you open the drawer and are standing too close to it.  It isn&#x27;t the strength of this product as it is very strong.  There is something different and it does not work for what I needed for.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOTHING BUT LEFT A FOUL ORDER IN BASEMENT.  IT SMELLS HORRIBLE AND DOES NOTHING AT ALL!  NEED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET!</li>
    <li> We bought this to help rid our house of mice....worked somewhat....also added a pleasant aroma to our home.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for mouse repellant and it does not work at all for that purpose. The mice don&#x27;t mind the smell. I still had to plug up all the holes I could find with steel wool. However the product itself smells really nice if you like peppermint. It makes the house smell clean and wintery. So all in all not a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> Oil seems to be weak. Peppermint aroma only lasts a few days. Has a &#x27; not so peppermint&#x27; aroma.</li>
    <li> This oil is very strong.  Beware of using too much and remaining with too much peppermint fragrance in the air.  Too much can be overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I was totally disgusted with this product!! Did not smell anything close to Peppermint!! Horrible undesirable smell!! Would not recommend.[[ASIN:B003C54M9A Peppermint Oil 100% Pure -16oz]]</li>
    <li> If you are wanting 100% pure peppermint oil do not buy this product. If you look it says that it is Mentha arvensis not Mentha piperita. Mentha piperita is peppermint oil. Mentha avensis is cornmint oil. Two different types of oils.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the oil you need not use a lot a tiny bit well go far very strong smell in a good way will be reorderiing</li>
    <li> I intended to use this for pest repelling.  I don&#x27;t know if it would have worked, because I procrastinated and it sat on a shelf for a few months.  This complaint is about the packaging.  One day I noticed that the plastic bottle was sweating.  Little beads of resinous material were seeping through as the plastic was being dissolved.  The packaging is not suited for containing its contents.  I posted a photograph of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked to return it.  The company said it was past the 90 day limit, but they&#x27;d be nice and take it back anyway.  I wasted another $10 to ship it back to them.  I put it in a ziploc to keep it from leaking through the box.  The company claims they never got it.  I never got my refund.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the usual peppermint oil that is sold in stores. It is NOT Mentha Piperita, the usual species of peppermint that has a delicate, sweet, strong fragrance. This Japanese stuff (probably a very cheap copy) has a mild, rather disgusting odor that actually smells like turpentine and a little peppermint added. If you are looking for real peppermint oil, DO NOT buy this product. Make sure you buy Mentha Piperita oil. I told the sellers to stop marketing this disgusting product. There are so many negative reviews on it.</li>
    <li> Very strong fragrance -- used it in many ways including spraying it on cotton squares and taping them to in-take heating vents that resulted in the smell permeating all the heating ducts and greatly reducing mouse activity.  It may in fact have been totally effective, but it needs to be done on a daily basis - twice  day.  That was my experience -- very satisfied with the service and the product.</li>
    <li> Yes it did we did a full house cleaning and once that was done spayed the baseboards all they way around so far no rodents but every now &amp; then waterbugs coming in from neighbors</li>
    <li> I bought this to run mice out of the attic, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value. 100% pure and plenty of it.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is making candles this year and is using some too.</li>
    <li> Not as crisp a smell as other Peppermint oils. We are using this stuff in our laundry anyways. Good price for the amount. Like I said we just mix it with our detergent and fabric softener. Also use it in our bug spray mix as well.</li>
    <li> We use a lot of peppermint oil.  We use it to keep away mice, add to shampoo &amp; candy making.  This product was very dissappointing because it tastes like varnish or shellac was added to the oil.  Because of the smell we use it only for the mouse issue.  We don&#x27;t dare ingest or use it on ourselves even tho it says pure oil.  Compare it to a small vial bought from Whole Foods or any other local store.  Dissappointing!</li>
    <li> Found it wasn&#x27;t as concentrated as a previous brand I used.</li>
    <li> As represented.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Sometimes a mouse comes in the house through doors left open and I bought this in case the one I last saw might find his surroundings less hospitable than the neighbors as a choice.  :-)  I haven&#x27;t seen any droppings or food disturbance so I can only guess that it works ok.</li>
    <li> Peppermint Oil 100% Pure -16oz was excellent in assisting in the exterminating of moles in my yard. It is wonderful around the garbage can in the garage.</li>
    <li> We heard about using peppermint oil to control rats and it works great. It was a great discovery and now we keep peppermint oil on hand for those pesky little critters.</li>
    <li> I really liked it and it did serve the pupose.  I love the smell.  just recently started to use it, heard about it on T V. so I decided to use it.has many uses.</li>
    <li> This is great!! I use it to keep mice out of my garage and basement. Works like a charm.Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smelled like peppermint and the price was right. I would order it again, but it make some time as you use very little.  We have a hunting camp and when we are gone we use it to keep the mice away and we put it throughout our cabin to make sure they can smell the peppermint. They do not like the smell !!  In our home we use little amounts for the peppermint smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this to discourage mice.  According to my dogs, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work to well.  However, it makes a great air freshener and garbage pail freshener, so I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind mice outside though in my house will not tolerate. Order the peppermint oil now a few times, believe it or not, IT WORKS! Havn&#x27;t had any signs of the little creatures and hope not to. I look constantly. Every two weeks like clock work i&#x27;ll  put a few drops on each one around the house and in my shed.</li>
    <li> Great smell love peppermint oil.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep spiders away. It works. Only problem is it draws bees. LOL</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It really does work. Have ordered before</li>
    <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t work on mice</li>
    <li> I use this to keep away spiders it works great and other bugs also. Works on mice if you have them also my mom uses it cause she lives on a farm and gets them.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT for mouse repellent and makes house smell fresh too. I Live on a ranch I use it often &amp; this amount will last years.</li>
    <li> We had an ant problem at our new house.  I mean a really big ant problem.  But we also have a 4 yr old, two dogs, and a cat who spend a lot of time near the ground.  I was really against pesticide use in our home, so I&#x27;m really glad we found this product.  After I sweep and mop, I put a little of this on a cotton ball and edge the tile with it.  No more ants. Period.  Obviously you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to get this in your eye, but it&#x27;s a lot safer for kids and animals than pesticides.  Plus, it smells nice.  I put a few drops on my vacuum sweeper&#x27;s filter and the whole house is refreshingly minty.  This will not get rid of ants in your walls though.  If you have that kind of problem you probably need to call a professional.  But for ants in the house... don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try, Wanted it to put on cotton balls and place them around in vacation home to keep the field mice away, and it is working so far.</li>
    <li> Not peppermint oil. Photo not of peppermint oil - SCAM! Amazon needs to remove. Will not work for rodents. Will not smell like peppermint.</li>
    <li> Use this to mix with vinegar to eliminate any pesty pests...ants, fleas, flys....also put a dab on cotton ball and put in vents and the smell is just heavenly!!</li>
    <li> good, very strong peppermint. happy with this product and the shipping time. I have ordered more from this company because this transaction went so well.</li>
    <li> interestingly enough, i have purchased this several times and the smell seems to always be a bit different.  sometimes it smells just like when you open a new pack of gum and you get that fresh smell, other times it almost smells medicinal.  It has to do with the maturity of the plant they extracting from i think, but they all smell good.  I use it for pest control and in my opinion is a great alternative to chemicals.</li>
    <li> This product really did not meet my expectation because I am still faced with the problem which I thought this product would resolve.</li>
    <li> ...where to begin.  Smaller than expected.  Was trying to get rid of some&lt;br /&gt;mice that got in through a broken piece of panelwood.  House smelled&lt;br /&gt;wonderful, like it was Christmas.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping the mice away.</li>
    <li> Label reads, pure peppermint oil/ concentrated. And what I received was NOT peppermint oil it smells terrible!! It smells exactly like amonia! I will NEVER purchase from this company again!!</li>
    <li> This product does not smell like peppermint oil but like a petroleum product of some sort with a bit of a minty aspect.  It has a weird viscosity compared to what I know of as actual peppermint oil.  It does not repel rodents well although it did make some difference; it repels humans quite well, though.  Maybe worst of all is that the container is permeable so the oil seeps right through, beading on the outside surface of the container: what a mess, not to mention a waste of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/18/13 Update: Product is finished and I&#x27;ll not waste $$ here again.  The product having oozed through the container ruined the finish on the cabinet where we had it sitting; the container has now turned soft to boot.  It stinks (as it has from the beginning; see above) and it&#x27;s ability to repel rodents is mediocre at best.  I&#x27;ll go back to the (known!)peppermint oil I was using previous to this purchase.  If you insist on making your pocketbook lighter with this product, though, be SURE and move the oil, whatever it is, into a glass bottle immediately on receipt so as to at least avoid damaging your cabinetry.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I am giving this a four, because the bottle is not the right one for this oil...The oil &#x27;sweats&#x27; through the bottle...Change the bottle please...</li>
    <li> I am going to use it to keep spiders away.  It will work fine for that purpose.  I am a massage therapist and it is not the grade that I would use in my practice.  The smell is off, the color is off.  This is not something that I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Not 100% had to send back for credit- did not work on the mice they just complained and wailed when we put out</li>
    <li> do not waste time and money this product does not work save your money and buy something that really works</li>
    <li> I bought this to put around my bunny cages to keep the mice from eating the bunny food.  It did the trick, and also had the benefit of overpowering the scent of bunny urine.  Much better!</li>
    <li> Very good, helped my arthritis pain. And I felt like this peppermint oil stayed on my skin longer and worked well.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil great I use it in a mix to clean my counters,spray the garage trash cans smells great&lt;br /&gt;Put on cotton balls keeps away critters and bugs, also go to add to bug spray or rubs a bit on keeps tics away</li>
    <li> This is your best bargain for peppermint oil. I bought it because I was told peppermint oil repels spiders. I have too many spiders living outside by my windows and shudders. It does not repel spiders, but I have found that the oil does wonders for sore muscles. The scent also helps me sleep better.</li>
    <li> My problem was ants around my kitchen island.  The peppermint oil was perfect for correcting  this problem.  The ants disappeared.</li>
    <li> Did the job mixed with water and spray orotund windows, doorways, keeps the mice and spiders away.</li>
    <li> I love this. I use this for headaches/migraines, repellent for spiders in the home and outside the home. I will keep this on hand.</li>
    <li> bye bye rodents. they hate the smell of this stuff</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product. Yet and still I wanted to try it for myself!!! The reviews on the product were correct. This is not 100% peppermint oil like the company who sells it says!!  This is a fraudulent product and the company who sells it should be ashamed of themselves!!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I am using it for mouse/varmit and cat repellent in my garage. I know that sounds strange, but it works quite well. Cats don&#x27;t like strong odors so this will hopefully keep them from entering my garage and spraying my stuff.  I know it also keeps mice away. Spray on the firewall of your car to keep mice out of the insulation. It&#x27;s great as long as you don&#x27;t mind a strong minty odor.</li>
    <li> The picture is a little deceiving. Just got it and I thought it would be bigger. Have not tried the oil yet, but it is strong just open e bottle for a moment and the whole house smells of peppermint oil.</li>
    <li> I use this on cotton balls tucked in places where mice might visit, or where I have seen evidence of them, it works.  The little critters do not like peppermint oil.  Buying this size was really good too, I have been paying $5 or an ounce.  When I was on vacation once, they got in my pantry.  I have peppermint oil in there now, no more mice.  This is good for me, I live in the county on 2 acres, and have lots of critters around.</li>
    <li> It is as advertised. But, the reason I bought it was to get rid of spiders. It did not work for me. Maybe it needs to be full strength, as I did mix it with tap water.</li>
    <li> great I use it in footcreams and also as a mouse and spider repellant</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this product.  Was extremely satisfied and continues to be extremely satisfied.  Will be ordering again in the near future.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works. I haven&#x27;t seen a critter since I started using this oil. I love this stuff. It cost to much for the size and I do recommend this product</li>
    <li> This seemed to work okay.  It also had a very pleasant aroma.  It was a bit costly, but still okay.</li>
    <li> I have read numerous places that mice do not like Peppermint. Well I purchaced this product and basically slathered my house in it. My neighbor could even smell it from his yard. Well guess what. The critters still came. So unless Someone has some helpful hints, I told God after 4 years I am done with the humane ways of ridding my house of these pests. I am going to get the good old spring loaded smack &#x27;em and kill &#x27;em traps.</li>
    <li> Using this product to stave off mice in the garden.  Still have some but not as many stealing newly planted seeds.</li>
    <li> it works wonderful to chase the mice out of the house and garage as well.</li>
    <li> I wanted a larger quantity of peppermint oil, I did not read the reviews like I normally do and did an impulse buy.  What a waste of money.  I use peppermint oil in my diffuser to help with energy level while I am on the treadmill. So much for that money, don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
    <li> I does not smell like peppermint oil, it actually smell like some kind of pine sol that I use to clean the house. Compared to the peppermint oil I recently brought this stuff is horrible.</li>
    <li> Well its peppermint oil idk what else there is to say? Smells nice, got exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> Product picture and all text deceptively hide the fact that this is wild/field mint instead of peppermint oil! Smells of turpentine. Unable to use for herbsl remedies. STILL WAITING FOR REFUND!!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this product is not 100% peppermint oil at all.  What I received was 100% mentha arvensis - wild mint or corn mint.  Look really good at the label.  The label that I&#x27;m currently looking at (my Amazon review site) says 100% Natural Oil.  The identification print says Peppermint Oil 100% Pure - 16oz.  If you want 100% Peppermint Oil, this IS NOT IT!!!</li>
    <li> I had read on line that it was use to get rid of mice in the wall which was the same problem that I  had, so we ordered it and put it on cotten balls and place then in the closets, the atic, draws and anywhere I thought the mice might run and let me say I keep a clean house but I have had these little buddies for a long time they ate poison and avoided any traps but for now they seem to be gone and its been 3 months - it had to be the peppermint oil for the first time in years there is no mice droppings anywhere! It worked when nothing else did.</li>
    <li> Makes the house smell yummy. Repels rodents.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and works great</li>
    <li> I love it,  it  works wonderful,  and smells great!  Thank you:)</li>
    <li> The oil was mixed with the weeds that grew with it.  The pure smell of peppermint that grows in my garden were somewhat lacking.  But I might consider buying more</li>
    <li> I was looking for pure peppermint oil, which this is not. Peppermint for rodent deterrent does not work, when it has other oils in it ;-) My mistake. Nice smelling mix that definitely helps a sicky breath when nothing else will.</li>
    <li> Great buy and your house smells great as you rid yourself of those pesky mice.</li>
    <li> The peppermint Oil was worth purchased because the price.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, I ordered it twice the 1st was nice and strong but when I ordered it the second time it was not strong. That&#x27;s why not five stars</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a natural mice deterrent--it seems to work.  Please note the size in ounces--it appears much larger in photo.</li>
    <li> What I got worked good , but the lid was loose on one and about 1/3 of it leaked out an was in bag that it was shipped in &amp; soaked invoice too</li>
    <li> Theiving scam artists. Buy nothing from these con artists.  It&#x27;s not peppermint oil. They know it&#x27;s not peppermint oil yet they advertise and sell this garbage as such, hence theiving, scamming, con artists.</li>
    <li> This is not anything like peppermint oil and this misrepresentation has now cost me nearly $1000 when I mixed it into a product that was supposed to taste good! It tastes awful! Now what am I going to do? You have ruined me.  I rated 1 star because it&#x27;s as low as I could go.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re using to keep mice out. When we first placed on cotton rounds and put around the house I came home and thought the entire house smelled of turpentine. Very strong and almost unpleasant. When I used a tiny bit for spa purpose it was nicer smelling.</li>
    <li> This has worked great but be very careful it&#x27;s pretty powerful almost had to cancel Thanksgiving so I aired out the room</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and pricing!</li>
    <li> Very strong aroma. use a small amount on a cotton ball, place in a room and wait a bit to see if its tolerable. I got a little over zealous and littered &amp;#34;soaked&amp;#34; cotton balls all over the place. After about 10 minutes I was gasping, gathering cotton balls in a bag and getting them outside. Re-applied a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; to about 3 cotton balls and placing strategically around the house.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to rid your house of mice, spiders, and other critters!  I think it works!!! But regardless, it smellos great.  Mix 1 part oil to 10 parts water.  Put in a spray bottle and spray insides of cabinets, baseboards, etd.</li>
    <li> We use peppermint oil in the barn to ward off rodents. This is peppermint oil. It arrived intact and on time. We will purchase again when we get low.</li>
    <li> this works great for keeping mice away, cheaper than when I had a cat.</li>
    <li> This stuff is ok, but it&#x27;s not pure peppermint  oil it&#x27;s blended with other ingredients, but I think amazon needs to specify that to customers, so there is no miss understanding on it&#x27;s purity and&lt;br /&gt;Will not have buys remorse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;El R</li>
    <li> This stuff is powerful but really smells great.  Used it around house to discourage pests.  Does second duty in oil burners as a scent for the house</li>
    <li> I am very displeased with this so called peppermint oil 16oz. I&lt;br /&gt;Have ordered  so many times from other companies and the smell is horrible. It also&lt;br /&gt;Came with less than 16oz I tried to deal with company and it was so exhausting as well as they were accusing me of using it and changing cap. They have some major customer service issues. Buyer beware...still trying to return it and it said unable to return.</li>
    <li> Not saying it doesn&#x27;t work but not overly impressed. Bought it to discourage spiders on our front and back porches. Spiders are still here. Will continue to use and hope over time it will work. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> used it about a month ago and the scent is still strong. haven&#x27;t seen a rodent since. I will recommend this product to all my friends. a little dab will do you.</li>
    <li> I am waging war on spiders!! Just mix this peppermint oil with rubbing alcohol (1/2 oil to 1/2 alcohol) pour in large spray bottle and spray around the outside of your house, deck, porch roof or plants. Where ever spiders like to hang out. No more spiders at my house!!!</li>
    <li> STRONG and works well. I use it in a mixture for bugs and mildew in the basement and dark areas</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this bottle yet, but it should be okay</li>
    <li> came well sealed and smells great.</li>
    <li> VERY DECEPTIVE MARKETING!!!!  This is NOT PEPPERMINT For the lay person you might think this is actually peppermint.  Why because that&#x27;s what they are advertising.  The botanical name for peppermint is ++Mentha piperita++  This guy is misleading people by stating this is Peppermint and selling a much cheaper Mentha arvensis, which is CORN MINT!!! Oh yes he does mention in the small print that it&#x27;s Mentha arvensis, but if you are not a Botonist you may trust that it is 100% pure Peppermint.  Its smells terrible!  My customers walked in my office  and said immediatly, PINE-SOL!  No one would mistake Peppermint for Pine-Sol .  I bought this on E-BAy and they are agressivly defending themselves by saying the US Gov consideres this Peppermint.  There should be a disclaimer, better yet call it what it is  CORN MINT....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; IT IS SOME TYPE OF OIL&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be great to oil your bicycle chain but not if you want to make a peppermint tea.  Bull snot!! deceptive advertising DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just as good as the more expensive brand - last just as long</li>
    <li> with both together I had hope they would work  but it didn&#x27;t go well</li>
    <li> We were told that peppermint oil would deter spiders. NOT! Don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;ll do with the remainder in the bottle. It was too expensive.</li>
    <li> Been in Hospital Back surg. sorry cant set long, when i do I&#x27;m ordering more thank you  but every thing good thank you .</li>
    <li> I expected mentha pepperita this does not compare. This oil smells so bad it gave me a headache. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...this is my 2nd bottle.  Excellent service and product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to control a mouse problem I have in my shop.  This stuff stinks to high heaven and really doesn&#x27;t work.  Well, let me change that.  It does work when applied because NO ONE including the mice can stand to be in the same vicinity as this stuff.  In closing, if you don&#x27;t have the ability to smell, this may work for you but if you don&#x27;t walk away.  It is not worth it for the purpose of controlling mice.</li>
    <li> Product smelled nothing like peppermint oil. It smells like turpentine. I&#x27;ll never buy it from that vendor again. I have other peppermint oil that smells right</li>
    <li> Its didn&#x27;t work for my problem</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past and buying at a grocery store this product is very expensive so now I will have enough without worrying about running out in the middle of the winter. I use on cotton swabs and place an where I think mice might come in and where they did come in in the past and so far used for the past two years and have not had any more problems. I highly recommend this product for this use.</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected. The mice acted like it was water. But thanks for the try anyway.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. I have used other peppermint oils at about the same price. This product is very watery, not a thicker oil which is what I&#x27;m used to buying. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if item was out of date or watered down the smell had little peppermint almost stale smelling as if gone bad</li>
    <li> This product is disgusting! I purchased it for my office and because we love the smell and the effect that peppermint oil seems to have on our patients.  Unfortunately I was out of the office when it came in and the receipt has since been lost. However it smells nothing like peppermint in any shape form or fashion.  The only thing that I can relate the smell to is Pine-sol household cleaner. I am truly very unhappy with this product. So basically I just threw away $30.  Very Dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Product as expected.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I still have not received this product so I would have to give it a poor review.  It says it is still in route after a month and real no easy way to contact a person to find out what happened.</li>
    <li> great for spraying the basement to keep spiders away!!</li>
    <li> Very speedy service and the product met my expectations.  Product is of quality standards.  I would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Not as pronounced a peppermint smell as others I&#x27;ve smelled. One of them is wrong I think.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to rid of mice. I put it in a spray bottle and dilute it. The smell stays strong and I use it dail in areas where I suspect mice may creep in.. I have not seen a mice since I&#x27;ve been using it. Despite the reviewers who say this is not peppermint oil, it works for me.</li>
    <li> does help keeping the mice away . I put a little on small balls of cotton and put them in the cellar. H ave NOT seen any signs of mice since . Thank You !!</li>
    <li> it works very well and even smells good</li>
    <li> IT MAKES A HOME SMELL FRESH!</li>
    <li> Great price and shipped FAST and well sealed. I have already started using it around the house. Mixing with water to spray to ward off spiders and ants. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> you hear all kinds od statement regarding peppermint oil. Well I finally tried it and I can say so for it&#x27;s working for rodents I have not seen any sign of the little pest</li>
    <li> First site should indicate this product can not be returned!!  So now that Im stuck with it - can anyone share what I can &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; this oil with in order to mop my floors - water won&#x27;t do it - I&#x27;m thinking like witch hazel, alcohol, ????  mopping floors keeps fleas and roaches away - makes the home smell wonderful - this product is &amp;#34;uncut&amp;#34; which I didn&#x27;t realize when I purchased - any suggestions appreciated.  thanks</li>
    <li> bought five different oils from this company ,at the same time, and ,,FOUR OF THEM LOOK AND SMELL,,  the same ,i think those  oils are junk ,Peppermint for instants do not even close to the real one smell or taste not even close !!!</li>
    <li> Many have said that this is the best mouse deterrent out there.....  HOPE it works.....  Smell good......  Using in my Motorhome</li>
    <li> I use peppermint oil ,1 pint to a gallon of water! I spray it in my attic , along walls in my living area, or other places wher evidence shows signs of rodent traffic!&lt;br /&gt;Rodents ,for the most sport ,do not like the smell. They leave!&lt;br /&gt;Good , cheap, non toxic !</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to pour from this bottle (I&#x27;ve had other 16oz bottles, like Now) without losing a ton of the oil. At the high price I paid for this, I think that is just ridiculous. Better product design would be good..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, compared to Now&#x27;s Peppermint oil, this oil has a very, very weak/faint scent and isn&#x27;t very effective for diffusing.</li>
    <li> This oil is only in very small amounts in the stores and is the best for keeping pest away. I have found that it keeps spiders away. I will be trying it on my wasp problem this summer.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as strong as other peppermint oils I have previous purchased it seemed a little watered down. Not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FRAGRANCE SO FAR!!</li>
    <li> Bought to keep rodents out of RV for winter.  Shipment was quick.  Product is of good quality.  School is sill out on how effective product is. On keeping rodents out of RV.</li>
    <li> Great value! Save yourself some $$$$ compared to the small 1oz bottles</li>
    <li> WE ARE HOPING THAT IT IS HELPING AND WILL WORK TO DRIVE THIS CREATURE OUT OF THE HOUSE. BEING POSITIVE ABOUT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> too soon since application to judge it&#x27;s effectiveness.  will have to wait and see if our rodent problem abates as a result.</li>
    <li> Does what i want it too</li>
    <li> works good for keeping mice out of sheds etc</li>
    <li> alittle goes a very long way!  Smells so good when used in proper ratios.  Out of the container is strong and kind of turpentine like, but if you dilute it 5:1 its great!  Keeps spiders out of my house and smells great!  Awesome in floor machines and leaves no residue.  If you have a wood stove and put some in your cast iron pot to humidify the air, that smells beautifully as well and decongests very well!  I love this!</li>
    <li> Great Product and Fast service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;&#x27;ve used peppermint oil for years with good results, i.e no mice.  For some reason, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working this year.  Repellents should work in theory, but in practice old fashioned traps, and plugging the openings still seems to be the best.  Plus, a cat or two wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the pure oil anywhere so thank you for having some I will be ordering some for my mom she lives in the country and always has mice now she can stop them and not have to worry about traps</li>
    <li> This product did not smell like peppermint at all. The Now brand has a much heavier peppermint scent that lasts longer. I am terribly disappointed in this product and would like a refund.</li>
    <li> Great product for insect repellant!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am so unhappy I was thinking when they said 100% pure that would mean it was not diluted. Boy was I wrong! You open the bottle and are hardly even able to smell Peppermint. Let alone get the normal warming from it. I would not recommend this oil to anyone.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to make little bags to place around the house to ward off mice &amp; such. I have also been using it to add to water &amp; vinegar for a more natural cleaner with a nice minty smell. It has a strong enough smell that a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s multipurpose, I have a long list of things that I am going to be using it for and so far I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this to keep the mice out of my camper, I put 10 cotton balls in a baggie and add 5 teaspoons of peppermint oil..... then put the cotton balls in the drawers, and in corners of my camper..poof no mice!!! They want 14 bucks for 4 ounces of this stuff in my local store, so this was a huge bargain</li>
    <li> Use it on cotton pads under the hood and inside of my stored Mustang. Put Mustang in a barn for winter storage. Mice have been a problem in the past. The peppermint scent is pleasant to humans, but mice seem to stay away. Used it this past winter: no mice problems. So far, so good...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good peppermint oil once you delute it in water I expected the bottle to be bigger but other then that I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
    <li> GREAT PROUUCT , WE USE TO HELP KEEP CRITTERS OUT OF OUR CAMPER . PLESANT SMELL THAT SEEMS TO WORK .</li>
    <li> I was shocked when I opened the box and found this tiny container. Whatever you do, read everything carefully before you purchase any product. I was mislead by large looking picture they placed, and failed to notice that on the side of picture, the amount contained was only 16 oz. My mistake. Also, even though I thought $30.00 was a bit much, I ordered only to find out that this little bottle actually cost $36.00. I decided to take a positive attitude even though disappointed. Smells good, now I only hope I can spray this in basement to discourage mice as originally planned. There are not instructions included with this product, only picture on side of bottle that seems to indicate diluting process if desired.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this product is but it&#x27;s not peppermint oil. It smells awful, doesn&#x27;t have a sweet smell like peppermint. The price is cheaper than the vast majority of peppermint oils, I wasn&#x27;t sure why but now I know why. Do not burn this in your home it smells like a cleaning solution. I saw a previous reviewer say it smells like turpentine. Yea, that just about sums it up. Buy the brand NOW it&#x27;s awesome. I really don&#x27;t even want to give this company 1 star b/ their product is that awful</li>
    <li> works great fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have ordered peppermint oil in the past and this peppermint oil did not seem to smell as strong and did not last long smell wise. it had more of a plastic bottle smell to it. I rate it at just ok</li>
    <li> It seems like this last forever!! We have had it for quite some time and there is still so much in it! The smell is a bit over-powering in small rooms, but it fades rather quickly when left liquid. I have tried it in soap and it&#x27;s okay, I need to adjust my measurements. I didn&#x27;t like it in candles.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like not strong enough</li>
    <li> Came to me in a very timely manner and works great.  Just a cotton ball with some oil and it keeps the critters away.</li>
    <li> its pepperminty alright</li>
    <li> It did not work good, please do not buy it. Thanks</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for safe spider control...this is it! We were being invaded by spiders! Mixed this with some witch hazel and water and sprayed at all doors and windows and problem solved...added bonus...it smells great too!</li>
    <li> It evaporates much too quickly.  It works, but only for a very short time.  I can not afford this product.</li>
    <li> Excellant product, keeping the mice away.  Also using in steaming water on stove to breathe better.  Very strong.  Thank you,  Jan</li>
    <li> Really works. I would sometimes see or hear 2-3 mice per month. I don&#x27;t see any now. I did see 1-2 after I put oil down but when I put more cotton balls around, they were gone!</li>
    <li> I use this peppermint oil at our cabin to keep mice out.  I Love the scent, but the mice don&#x27;t.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This is DEFINITELY NOT 100% peppermint oil. More like pine sol</li>
    <li> It never really work. But would like try another one would work. It kinda work only for one day and it just came back the next day. Do you any other item that would treat the system good?</li>
    <li> Works well for cleaning the basement floor. Kills smell and spider population has significantly decreased.</li>
    <li> I was searching for alternatives to essential oil of peppermint.  This not only smells more like menthol, which is not the same, but I transferred some to 2 small spray bottles for spraying under the sinks to keep mice out and the bottles after 24 hours, practically were melting!  They caved in and got soft.  I would not recommend this for household use.</li>
    <li> Helps keep the mice away from my car engine.</li>
    <li> Does a great job. Many uses</li>
    <li> I purchased the peppermint, tea tree and cedarwood essential oils (16 oz) from this company.  They came in the white containers.  Wrong containers folks - the essential oils will break down this type of plastic (which all mine did)- it was an awful mess.  The oils themselves were very poor quality - I can&#x27;t even use them - complete waste of money.  Amazon - shame on you for letting such a poor quality company sell through your store.</li>
    <li> Liked this product. Kind of pricey but overall I have been pleased with this product.  I will probably buy again.</li>
</ol>
