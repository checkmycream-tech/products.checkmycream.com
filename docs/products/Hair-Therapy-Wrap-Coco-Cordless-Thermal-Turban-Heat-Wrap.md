<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was too lazy to do deep condition or hot oil treatments before, so I ordered this. Now, I try to do one or the other on a weekly basis, and my hair is thanking me for it. This product is so easy to use.. just be careful not to overheat it, okay? Careful.. with breaks in between as they recommend.. and you will be coming back to rate your own purchase as your curls thank you for hydration.</li>
    <li> Stays warm as it says, it can get to warm.  I use this ALL THE TIME, i just bought two more to have hair treatment parties! Using caps under it is very important.  I have not had to wash it yet, but i have taken good care of it from day one and i have had one for 4 years now, still going strong.</li>
    <li> this cap is such a great way to deep condition your hair with being tied down to a chair. i love this cap, and my hair loves it too.</li>
    <li> I already own this item but was purchasing a replacement. I purchased my last wrap from another website almost 2 years ago and have worn it out. I figured I&#x27;d go a little cheaper and purchase from this company. The wraps are different. I recieved this one and the velcro strip are vertical with horizontal flaps. How exactly do they expect you to adequately secure the cap? The cap itself was also too big. I&#x27;ll be going back to the old company to re purchase.</li>
    <li> Works very well for a deep treatment.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t  get hot enough .</li>
    <li> This head wrap is fantastic! It&#x27;s a great way to take care of your hair and still have mobility to get things done around the house!  This wrap heats easily with either hot water or the microwave. I use a Keratin conditioner and wrap the turban on my head.  I am then free to condition my hair while getting some house chores complete and I don&#x27;t have to worry about wires, etc. Purchased this item at a discount in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> Ok, at first when I opened the box, I was not sure at all about this product.  Mainly because of the microwave instructions. But after putting in a deep conditioning creme, following the instruction for the  heat wrap .....i was floored! It felt so good and not as heavy as I thought.  And I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair but it didn&#x27;t fall off not once and the velcro straps work great. Get it u won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and this does not give me the heat of an old school pug in type. Sorry to say I wasted my $$.</li>
    <li> So, when I first ordered this I was not paying full attention and thought it was a heat therapy for your body. But I was wrong. I do have to give it 5 stars because it works great, and it&#x27;s a nice wrap</li>
    <li> I used it once. I can&#x27;t tell the difference yet. Also, I ruined the gel packs and you don&#x27;t seem to have any. So, I&#x27;m buying another one and hope it goes well. Thank you. I can&#x27;t give it a review just yet.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, fit very well and had no problem staying on my head, stayed hot ...totally pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Not Bad! Stays warm about 20 mins strong.  A little issue with the heat distribution(only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars).  But 4 the money and what I get to do while doing a treatment,  I&#x27;ll Take It!!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I can deep condition with this portable heat wrap.  Be careful not to overheat the packs in the microwave.  I have actually fallen asleep with this wrap on but I do find that I have to heat it 2 or 3 times to get the effect that I want.  If you want to be mobile while you are deep conditioning and the price is right, then I would recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> Gives off a sufficient amount of heat to get the job done when you don&#x27;t have dryer or steamer to sit under.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this Cordless Thermal Turban Heat Wrap. It is a great tool for deep conditioning. I use it for hot oil treatments, to deep condition my hair and when I want my leave-ins, conditioners or styling products to penetrate deeper into my hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural low porosity hair. I was advised to add heat to my hair regimen to help my products work better. My hair retains more moisture, feels softer, and looks better since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there aren&#x27;t any hoses or wires to restrict me to sitting in one place when I use it.  I can do other things around the house or even take a nap when I have it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. My opinions are my own and this is my experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I needed a way to apply heat to my hair during my deep conditioning. This was way better than having to purchase a full on blow dryer or inconveniently use saran wrap since it always slips off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear shower caps are even included in the package for you to use under the hair wrap. Clear instructions are also included to help you put the wrap together and heat up the gel packs. I keep this on for about 30 minutes and voila! My hair is soft.</li>
    <li> I use the wrap weekly and it works great. Allows me to deep condition conveniently while cleaning and avoid having to pull out my bulky hooded hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is just what i have been searching for! I have very thick frizzy hair so I have to give it conditioning treatments often to keep it in a manageable form. I have also been coloring my hair for over 15 years so it has became semi damaged. I have tried using the foil hair caps that are supposed to heat up and they are a waste of time! I love how this gets hot but because you put it in the &amp;#34;towel cap&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t get to hot to wear! Being a busy mother I don&#x27;t have the time to sit still (although I would love to) so i can wear this while i&#x27;m working on stuff around the house or even if I am going to take a relaxing bubble bath this fits in well with my &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; treatments! I have already recommended this to several of my friends. I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review and i honestly HIGHLY recommend this if you are looking to fix damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;**picture is air dry and after was with a flat iron**</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, however for someone as low maintenance as me  (which means a shopping bag over my head and a scarf) this was kind of easy but still felt a lil bit extra.I love the concept which is why I purchased it. Ive used it once since i bought it and it&#x27;s been months.Mind you I HAVE deep conditioned y hair multiple times after.</li>
    <li> I green house my hair alot (spritz lightly with water cover with plastic cap sleep all night), But i could never sit all night with a plastic cap on, its just annoying. So i bought this to see if it would improve the time that this takes and it really did. i use it often i just put it in the microwave and wear it around for a few minutes and my dry hair is re moisturized.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. You&#x27;ll be very glad that you made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product for deep conditioning</li>
    <li> Ok.  Heats three sides pretty good.  Doesn&#x27;t provide heat for the back, just the other three sides.  Heavy. Instructions say only leave on for 20 minutes,  which is a very short amount of time to me.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using my Hair Therapy Wrap. This product is ideal for a &amp;#34;lounger&amp;#34; like me. I had to play with the temperature settings but once I found what would work for me, everything was all good!</li>
    <li> I received  this at a discount rate for my honest review. I put it in the microwave for 45 sec and used it with a deep conditioner my hair has never felt better I left it on 20 min  cannot wait to use when i need to color my hair highly  recommend</li>
    <li> I love my therapy thermal wrap. No more extra trips to the salon for deep conditioning. Easy to use and it warms my head just great. I even use it when I don&#x27;t feel like drying my hair. Just wrap and go to sleep. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent way to hydrate your hair. I would recommend this to anybody who&#x27;s into healthy hair. It&#x27;s good for all hair types.</li>
    <li> ReallyWorks! Use for my prepoo&#x27;s &amp; deep conditioning &amp; hot oil treatments &amp; happy to report my hair growth has increased in my natural hair journey quest! I&#x27;m thinking would make for a nice gift whether natural or relaxed!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair therapy wrap, mainly because of the quality and price. And needless to say I have been looking for a conditioning cap, for deep conditioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy when this product arrived faster than what, I anticipated. And in great condition. In the original packaging and&lt;br /&gt;just what I saw on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this Hair Therapy Wrap, to anyone that would like to take better care of their hair. And not have to sit under&lt;br /&gt;a dryer. And most of all no wires attached. You can freely move around and take care of your daily task.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is looking a feeling much better with the constant heat with my applied treatments, and conditioners. I really like this cap.&lt;br /&gt;Thank  you for giving me a chance to experience what I have been searching for, for years. Five Stars*****</li>
    <li> This review is for the Hair Therapy Wrap - Coco - Cordless Thermal Turban Heat Wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interesting and very functional hair wrap. The wrap comes to you flat without any of the heating packs inside. I didn’t realize this to begin with, but that is actually very smart. I can remove the packs and wash the turban anytime I want! So I actually prefer the way they put it together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The turban comes with 1 long heating pack that threads in through the front of the hat and into the back cover to get all of your hair if it is long. Then there are two side heating packs. The packs secure into the compartments with Velcro. It is easy to assemble and very secure once you get the packs in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is sort of a towel material. It is very soft and comfortable. I secured my packs into my turban and heated the whole thing in the microwave. It was ready to go in seconds, and went on easy and tied well with the flaps. I had coconut oil on my hair and was conditioning it all night. It was comfortable and nice to have the warm turban wrapped on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra heat on my hair while conditioning really made a difference. I found the coconut oil penetrated deeper into my hair shafts and scalp…. My hair was ultra soft the next few days from my treatment and I think it was due to the fact I had this wonderful heating cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 stars for functionality, materials and design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Can put this on my head and do all kinds of stuff around the house while my hair is conditioning.</li>
    <li> ThIs is a nice simple way to deep condition your hair and still get things done.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. It gets nice and hot and if I want a real deep conditioning, I only have to heat it up one extra time. It stays in place on my head and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy. My whole head feels evenly warm. I do worry about how the straps that keep it on will stretch out over time though. Other than that, wonderful purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this. I&#x27;m bummed, however, that it is not as awesome as it looks. First, the gel packs don&#x27;t stay hot for very long at all. My primary problem, though, is that due to the design, the crown and back of your head gets NO heat at all. Only the sides and immediate front and top get any heat at all. I tried to mitigate this by rotating it during my second reheating of the gel inserts, but still, the crown is left with no heat. This is a total waste and I would not by this product again. I&#x27;m just gonna get a regular hair dryer for my DCs like everyone else.</li>
    <li> So simple...just heat it up in the microwave.  It is easy to adjust to fit your head and stays warm for a considerable amount of time.  Great way to pamper yourself!</li>
    <li> I already used it, and I love the fact, that you don&#x27;t have to plug it in.  I kept it on for 1 hour. The only issue for me, the fabric was pulled because of the velcro.  You need to change from a terry fabric.  Use a fabric without a pile.</li>
    <li> Love this wrap it is so convent</li>
