### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Loved it!!!</li>
      <li>I bought two, amazingly beautiful rings love them !</li>
      <li>The quality isn&#x27;t all that good at all.</li>
      <li>How could something so cheap be so great.</li>
      <li>I liked it while it lasted.</li>
      <li>I liked the ring, however, in the picture it shows as a mid-ring which attracted me to buy it.</li>
      <li>Nice color--the chain isn&#x27;t attached so it does move around.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite rings in my collection.</li>
      <li>I am enjoying it :)</li>
      <li>Really cute..</li>
      <li>This product is awesome, I will certainly be looking for more in the future, thank you for the adorable rings!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>excellent care and products at the expected time as well as the just boxes to package size</li>
      <li>so it is easy to wear at almost any time.</li>
      <li>It is more like the length between your thumb to your pinky on a medium to large hand, but it looks a lot better on those two fingers than the one depicted.</li>
      <li>so my fingers can move freely without being restricted.  </li>
      <li>Literally a cheap gold chain connected to 2 cheap golden rings.</li>
      <li>They actually fit like normal rings on me, which I think makes them cooler and also makes my hands more moveable.</li>
      <li>and I love it completely!  </li>
      <li>I wear this very often &amp; I enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute but even clear fingernail polish doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>So fun to wear</li>
      <li>This can go with almost any style, from cute schoolgirl to soft grunge.</li>
      <li>It fits slightly larger than in the picture, but I think it might be more comfortable that way.  </li>
      <li>It really accentuates your hand and gives your hand a unique style.this item is definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Very cute and edgy midi rings, I purchased two one for my sister which she absolutely love  wearing it everyday and myself too so happy I bought this.</li>
      <li>I got several compliments before it changed colors though, but I wish the product was more durable in terms of tarnish.</li>
      <li>Thanks soo much!</li>
      <li>I have tiny fingers (size 5), so they didn&#x27;t fit like the picture.</li>
      <li>As I usually have dark nails, it almost always goes with them and kind of makes them pop out more.</li>
      <li>Overall I like it, the chain is a bit flippy-floppy, but I personally thing it&#x27;s cute and can work well.</li>
      <li>I love this little accessory.</li>
      <li>Such a sole and unique piece.</li>
      <li>I do suggest painting clear nail polish on the inside just in case.</li>
      <li>IDK whether it&#x27;s because my fingers are thinner or shorter, but also the chain attached seem to be far apart..</li>
      <li>the chain isnt fixed to a specific spot on the ring, so it just moves around, which can cause entanglement with fingers or getting caught on things instead of staying in place.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s edgy and unique.</li>

<li> This ring could be casual, as in going to school, or it could be a bit more formal, like a party with your friends.</li>
<li> It turned my finger green the first few hours I had it on.</li>
<li> too long and chain hung lower than expected</li>
<li> It also arrived sooner than expected.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not exactly a dressed-up ring (though you could make it out to be)</li>
<li> No complaints- expect it to turn fingers green, but for $2 you get what you pay for.  </li>
<li> Though mine got tangled in a way that made it impossible to be untangled, it is still wearable and goes with my personal style.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but I just wish it was exactly how the picture is shown as :(</li>
<li> I was so wrong.</li>
<li> The only downside is that they turn into this horrible brass-pinkish shade after a while.</li>
<li> It turns an ugly color &amp; looks like trash</li>
<li> Very annoying.</li>

    <li> Literally a cheap gold chain connected to 2 cheap golden rings. There is no stabilizer on the rings so it moves around a lot. Very annoying.</li>
    <li> I liked the ring, however, in the picture it shows as a mid-ring which attracted me to buy it. But, when I received it, it wasn&#x27;t a mid-ring; rather, it was like regular rings. IDK whether it&#x27;s because my fingers are thinner or shorter, but also the chain attached seem to be far apart.. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I just wish it was exactly how the picture is shown as :(</li>
    <li> Such a sole and unique piece. Arrived quickly and nicely packaged. Definitely recommend. 💋</li>
    <li> I bought two, amazingly beautiful rings love them !</li>
    <li> I wear this very often &amp; I enjoy it.  There is enough links in between the rings so my fingers can move freely without being restricted.  It fits slightly larger than in the picture, but I think it might be more comfortable that way.  No complaints- expect it to turn fingers green, but for $2 you get what you pay for.  I am enjoying it :)</li>
    <li> It really accentuates your hand and gives your hand a unique style.this item is definitely worth the money. It also arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Very cute and edgy midi rings, I purchased two one for my sister which she absolutely love  wearing it everyday and myself too so happy I bought this.</li>
    <li> the chain isnt fixed to a specific spot on the ring, so it just moves around, which can cause entanglement with fingers or getting caught on things instead of staying in place. i&#x27;ll probably just give this to someone instead of wearing it myself</li>
    <li> It turned my finger green the first few hours I had it on. It&#x27;s cute but even clear fingernail polish doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> I have tiny fingers (size 5), so they didn&#x27;t fit like the picture. They actually fit like normal rings on me, which I think makes them cooler and also makes my hands more moveable. The only downside is that they turn into this horrible brass-pinkish shade after a while. I got several compliments before it changed colors though, but I wish the product was more durable in terms of tarnish. All in all I liked it while it lasted. I might purchase it again, because I do like the way it fits my petite fingers, but then I&#x27;d probably have to purchase a bunch of backups so...</li>
    <li> You definitely get what you pay for. The quality isn&#x27;t all that good at all. I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I was reluctant because of the price. How could something so cheap be so great. I was so wrong. I love this little accessory. Whenever I wear it, people ask where I got it. I&#x27;m thinking of buying another one as well.</li>
    <li> Really cute..something different, but you get what you paid for.....</li>
    <li> didnt like it personally. too long and chain hung lower than expected</li>
    <li> excellent care and products at the expected time as well as the just boxes to package size</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I will certainly be looking for more in the future, thank you for the adorable rings!</li>
    <li> Loved it!!! So fun to wear</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite rings in my collection. As I usually have dark nails, it almost always goes with them and kind of makes them pop out more. This ring could be casual, as in going to school, or it could be a bit more formal, like a party with your friends.

Though mine got tangled in a way that made it impossible to be untangled, it is still wearable and goes with my personal style.</li>
    <li> It turns an ugly color &amp; looks like trash</li>
    <li> Too big to be a midi-ring, color fades</li>
    <li> The chain is a lot bigger than the picture shows</li>
    <li> Nice color--the chain isn&#x27;t attached so it does move around. The inner diameter is at about 1.6cm. Maybe a 6 1/2 or 7 in US sizes. It fits my middle finger and ring finger well. I do suggest painting clear nail polish on the inside just in case. Overall I like it, the chain is a bit flippy-floppy, but I personally thing it&#x27;s cute and can work well.</li>
    <li> I got it 10 days earlier than I should have and I love it completely!  Thanks soo much!</li>
    <li> This ring was not as advertised.  The length is a lot longer.  It is more like the length between your thumb to your pinky on a medium to large hand, but it looks a lot better on those two fingers than the one depicted. It&#x27;s edgy and unique.</li>
