    <li> this product is actually really great smells great and extends along the length of time</li>
    <li> No problems here.  Oil moisturizers my cuticles</li>
    <li> I liked it, it did just what it was suppose to. I don&#x27;t use it every day, just every once in a while, but I have still seen an improvement in my cuticles, I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> Using this product has made my cuticles less dry and more pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish the brush were larger and the hole the brush goes in on top of the bottle were larger.</li>
    <li> The smell is gooood and it works great</li>
    <li> I adore this cuticle oil. It is amazing not real oily but does a better job than the oily OPI I had. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Love it, just added to my Gelish family, you can find this stuff anywhere however could not beat the price. Love it does wonders.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of different cuticle oils but this is by far the best! My cuticles stay soft forever!</li>
    <li> Excellent! I received it very fast. It is very good for the nails.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  I had a nail bed injury causing a spilt nail.  I had had the spilt nail for a couple of years.  Started using the harmony oil.  The nail has started growing out no spilt.  Wished I had known about this 2 years ago.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I like the smell of this oil and it does wonders for the cuticles. Have tried other brands and like this the best. Best price I have found also is this one.</li>
    <li> real nice,, works well</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. This has a really nice, light scent to it. You only need a little bit and then massage it into your cuticles. I use it about twice a week because it keeps my cuticles hydrated for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I never got to use the cuticle oil as it arrived broken.  The enevelope that it was sent in was soaked with the oil.  We called and reported the problem to Jason on 3/13/14 at 9:25, he said we would get another bottle but we haven&#x27;t and now it is April 5.  I would appreciate someone looking into this.  Thank you.....The order # 115-0735054-5585058</li>
    <li> My nails look better with this product.</li>
    <li> gives my nails/cuticles as shine. I just rub it in after i place it on my nails. love this product</li>
    <li> I actually just used this this morning! LOVED IT! It helps with my nails health. I highly recommend it for winter time</li>
    <li> It has helped me to keep my cuticles healthy and my nails looking better. It has a nice scent and it absorbs properly.</li>
    <li> Stuff is kind of oily. If you bite your nails this stuff tastes gross.&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy with freq. hang nail. Does work for a while to reduce hangnail.&lt;br /&gt;Once you wash it off it still lasts a little while. The smell isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;Feel like a woman putting it on. Like painting your nails and question my manhood&lt;br /&gt;while doing it. I am tired of hangnail nail and ripping it off and making it bleed as well as&lt;br /&gt;feeling the burn. Seems to work but don&#x27;t taste it. Worry about the oil getting on shirts and things.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of rub it in.  Used 2 times so far and both times seems good. I tasted it both times and not a good flavor.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cuticle oil nightly for months and I&#x27;ve barely used a quarter of the bottle. It is great for moisturizing, and I haven&#x27;t had a single issue with my cuticles in all the time I&#x27;ve been using this. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but I put it on for a minute, rub it in and then put on hand lotion. So, the scent doesn&#x27;t bother me that much, and it kind of grows on you after a bit. Its a pleasant scent, I just like more tropical scents.And this little bottle is going to last me FOREVER which is really nice, too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any changes in nails</li>
    <li> I have been getting full sets of acrylic nails since highschool but when i decided to transition to my natural nails they were in terrible shape.  The oil smells great and it is a light scent, not overpowering and too strong like some others.  It nourishes my cuticles and prevents painful hang nails.  My mother picks at her cuticles and this has improved hers as well.</li>
    <li> Stays on for two weeks But not good for Nurses water is not its friend. Peels off and lifts up. RN4LIFE.</li>
    <li> I love this. Tried it and Already ordered and got my second one already ships fast works great</li>
    <li> Nice smell and good hydration. No complaints for the price, it works fine, but feels a  bit greedy for a lot of time after using.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used this nail oil long enough to know if I like it long-term.  It smells nice and soaks in fairly well.</li>
