<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I come from a family with a long history of baldness. My father and uncle are both almost completely bald already, so I was devastated when I noticed the hair on the top of my head thinning. I can&#x27;t afford expensive hair implants or surgery, and I refuse to take pills of any kind, so I started looking at other alternatives. Ultrax Laboratories was one of the first that came up in my search. After reading some reviews and checking all the other products I decided on this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say massage the shampoo into your scalp for 2 minutes, 5 times a week, so that&#x27;s what I did. The 8oz bottle lasted me about two months using it this often. The shampoo has a decent lather, and I found its best to take a generous amount and rub it in anywhere you want thicker hair. It doesn&#x27;t sting or burn like I thought it might, it actually feels nice. And after washed the shampoo out it left no oils or smell on my hair! It also didn&#x27;t dry my hair and scalp out, which I was very worried about because I read that some other products could do that. And paired with the Ultrax conditioner, it left my hair feeling as soft as ever! I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate change after the first uses, but by the third day I was losing less hair in my sleep! So I kept at it and during the second week I noticed little hairs sprouting on the top of my head where I was balding! Hair even started growing in spots around my hairline where they never had before, like around my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first month had passed I was already amazed at what this shampoo was doing for me. I&#x27;ve just finished my first bottle and the areas where I was shedding are almost completely filled in with short hairs! I&#x27;m sure it will take some time for the hair in that area to be completely normal again, since my hair is nearly 2 feet long, but I am relieved that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair anymore! Ultrax Laboratories is now a good friend of mine and I plan on using their products until my hair is back to normal! I would also highly recommend these shampoo and conditioner to anybody hoping to try and fight their hair loss.ducts until my hair is back to normal! I would also highly recommend these shampoo and conditioner to anybody hoping to try and fight their hair loss.</li>
    <li> After shopping around for a hair growth product that works, the Ultrax Lab Shampoo did not disappoint. As someone who is prone to thinning and shedding hair, after a few weeks I was able to see amazing results of fullness and length!!! The volume this product produces is amazing and it can be used on any hair type. I was equally impressed by the pleasant smell and great lather this shampoo  creates. I leave the product in for about 3-4 minutes as directed and after rinsing, there is no film, buildup or residue. If you are looking for a shampoo that not only cleans your hair but helps it growth and look better, then look no further!</li>
    <li> This ultrax labs caffeine shampoo does everything it claims to do,  The 0.2% Ketoconazole in this helps with the scalp issues, and the hair is growing faster now &amp; less shedding because of this shampoo.This has now become my new current favorite shampoo. I suggest you buy and try this out too. I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product, does not take long to start working. I noticed a change after about 5 uses. Shipped fast. Would recommend to anyone looking for help with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I received my new shampoo a week or two ago and I have really noticed a difference already. This product seems to me to tingle when I use it. My wife says she thinks she sees some new hair growth already. I have been thinning and losing hair for a while and I believe I may have finally found a product that will at least stop the loss and maybe reverse it somewhat. I will continue with the daily regimen and hopefully will continue to see improvement. Admittedly, the cost is higher than most but I believe it is entirely worth it.&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this shampoo to my family and friends without a doubt.</li>
    <li> it really works! I got results fast now its thicker and I can tell a difference  for the better.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My initial thought it that it smelled sweet like bubble gum. But maybe it&#x27;s just me. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but both times it has not dried out my hair and it feels the same as when I used to use my old shampoo, so I am feeling pretty positive about this product.    UPDATE ON ABOVE REVIEW!!!  I am still using the shampoo as instructed and I still love the smell. My hair is soft and shiny after I use it and I have seen an increase in my hair length.</li>
    <li> There are many hair growth products out there on the market, but this one has been proven to get the most optimal results. Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo promotes healthy hair growth, stops hair loss and gives your hair that much-needed shine. With the combination of the anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal ingredient such as Ketocnazole and caffeine, it stimulates your hair and gives it that much needed jolt from follicle to shaft. It&#x27;s extra strength to give it that extra boost. It&#x27;s time for your hair to wake up.</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with my hair shedding and have searched and tried many different products with no success. My search is over. Ultrax Labs Hair Surge has really reduced my shedding drastically. It works great with my hair type and doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other products have. It&#x27;s also very easy on my scalp. I am going to stick with this because the results will keep getting better over time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my father.  He said he noticed within weeks that his hair appeared fuller and healthier.  My mother divorced him several years ago and I really believe this product helped him get the confidence he needed to get back into the dating game again!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It was delivered before I even expected. I&#x27;ve used it twice and already I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my hair. It seems healthier, and shinnier and it doesn&#x27;t break off like it used to. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with unhealthy, damaged hair. It works!</li>
    <li> It was expensive and it really didn&#x27;t do anything, I saw a couple baby hairs appear but.not really anything</li>
    <li> What a wonderful and  amazing product! I love that it&#x27;s a shampoo and it works wonderful on regrowing your hair.</li>
    <li> As I searched the internet for products that would stimulate my scalp and promote growth, I found great reviews on Ultrax Lab Hair Surge. Once I read the ingredients, I had a revelation. The word caffeine rang a loud bell and memories of my childhood.&lt;br /&gt;My African American mother utilized all types of home remedies during my childhood, even though they were strange; one ingredient worked. The ingredient was caffeine. Twice a week, mom had the difficult task of braiding her daughters’ kinky hair.&lt;br /&gt;In the sixties, there was a limited supply of hair care products. The purchase of detangling solution was not an option. Mom solution to detangle my hair was 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee with warm water. After greasing my scalp, she apply coffee with a hair brush and braid my hair in plaits. The family joke was; our scalps were good to the last drop. Even though my sister and I scalp smelt like coffee on a daily basis, we had a good length of healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;After 35 years of self-inflicted hair damages from braid extensions, coloring, perms and hair weaves, the purchase of Ultrax Lab Hair Surge was the life line that evoked change. I equate, the slaughter of my scalp to misleading advertisements and purchase of at home hair care products&lt;br /&gt;For instance, when celebrities endorse hair care products via television and magazines, the power of persuasion wins. Like myself, the consumer makes a purchase. There&#x27;s a famous R&amp;B entertainer who endorses a product that claim to bring an end to dull and flat hair. NOT! How is that possible, when the famous African American female entertainer is wearing a long lace front blonde wig? Consumers view the illusion and make a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Once I purchased Ultrax Labs Hair Surge, I made an appointment with my hair stylist. During the appointment, the stylist C. applied two shampoos, the texture of brittle menopausal hair was revitalized.  The shampoo application brought a cool surge to my scalp and felt so good; I refused a hair conditioner application. After stylist dried and styled my hair, I couldn&#x27;t believe the transformation. Not only was I impressed with the texture of my hair, C. stylist was also impressed. The only other product she used my hair was oil sheen. Needless to say, C. vowed to purchase Ultrax Lab Hair Surge.&lt;br /&gt;I called my sister, who suffers from alopecia and convince her on the product. T. stated, what I have to lose, long as I won&#x27;t smell like a hot cup of coffee I will try it.  Thank you Ultrax Labs for a great products and evoking great childhood memories.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for African Americans, individuals with kinky hair and women going through menopause.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you posted on the growth as I make additional purchases.a hair conditioner application.

    <li> This product is effective and not only that but it smells great. Caffeine is a natural remedy for hair loss so it makes sense that it works so well in a shampoo!</li>
    <li> Bought Ultrax Labs Hair Surge on Amazon and my hair felt better after the first use.  I had breast cancer before and it is a hair loss and hair growth stimulating shampoo and I urge everyone to give it a try for hair growth stimulating and to make your hair grow back stronger if you have lost some in the past.  My hair feels and looks so much better!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have really seen a difference in the thickness of my hair. Hair Surge really delivers they say i will notice thicker and fuller hair. The product came quickly and I love the pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> The citrus scent was very refreshing.  I am african american and chemically relax my hair.  There was NO shedding, easy to comb while wet.  Much fuller after I blow dried it.  It didn&#x27;t even need conditioner.  My edges were thinning from hot irons, wigs and extensions and now it is fuller.  Im very satisfied with it.  Id like to get the rest of their hair care line.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t holding my breath, but this actually worked quite well! My favorite feature besides the growth is, as others have mentioned, that it reduced the amount of hair I shed. Definitely will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This product was awesome! So far I can tell that my hair is actually growing back and it seems to be working just fine! I love it so far and will continue to use it until I have to buy another bottle! I would deff recommend this shampoo to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to lose any more hair! Its a big bottle too so i feel like it will last an extremely long time! Which is ultimately good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 100% satisfied with this product. I have to say that what I love most about it is that it&#x27;s working for me like it said it would and its ease of use. I&#x27;m a single parent, so time is an extremely important factor for me when buying and using any kind of beauty product. Therefore, I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled about the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take multiple steps to apply and remove and it&#x27;s simple to use without too much down time in between. I didn&#x27;t go crazy on how many times I pumped because I know that I didn&#x27;t have to see a lot of suds to know that this product is working. Since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo, I&#x27;ve noticed some baby like hairs growing around my hairline particularly where my bangs are at, which is where I noticed that I was loosing a bit of my hair from years of mistreating it and I also noticed less shedding while in the shower. Plus, I really like the pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I came about this purchase in a strange way. My over-bearing mother-in-law Purchased it and left it in my bathroom after thanks giving. She constantly berates me about my thinning hair with snide comments. I decided to use it because my hair has been thinning and it wasn&#x27;t cheap. It Doesn&#x27;t have the best application, I Like allot of suds, but that&#x27;s about my only complaint. In two week my 2 yr old said I had &amp;#34;fluffy hair&amp;#34; and could really see the difference. After a little more then a month I ran out and bought it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Christmas rolled around and I saw my Mother-in-law again. She commented on my thicker head of hair. She tried to beat around the bottle she left, and I come to find out she had me doubling as the guinea pig since she is thinning to. I Said I never used it, and had been using a mixture of 50% Vinegar and 50% egg yolks left on for 2 hours at a time. She still has thinning hair and smells like an old deli now.&lt;br /&gt;  I am still buying this shampoo because it works great. I don&#x27;t know if the results would last if I stopped using it but I am too scared to try. So the math for my review is this: 5 stars for service, quickness, results of the shampoo, and overall satisfaction. minus 1 star for not having a more appealing scent (not bad, but not channel), and for not  having a better lather. Plus 1 star for being the vehicle of revenge on my mother-in-law (or wicked witch as I call her). This leaves me with a 5 Star rating over all. I could not be more satisfied if George Clooney delivered it to my shower.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! A must buy to take care of thin hair. It also has a great lather and smell. I would highly recommend to anyone that want fuller thicker hair quickly. Overall an amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchase this product, but trust me, it&#x27;s not the last time!!! I just love this shampoo. I have always had very fine straight dark hair, and as time went on, a couple of pregnancies, and after years of dyeing my hair (three of those a caramel blonde), I swear I was thinking I might be getting bald. It was traumatizing! I cut my hair very short (pixie) and stop dyeing it. I thought that was the solution, until the grey hair made its debut...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended me Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo, and after about a 2 weeks I noticed my hair was stronger, healthier, silky, it just felt great!!! After a month, I had fuller hair, which means less hair loss. I will stop now because I don&#x27;t want to sound cocky, but I am eternally grateful. This shampoo really did gave my my confidence back. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! Some of the best shampoo I have even had, after using this product it left my hair silky and smooth. Didn&#x27;t leave it with that greasy feeling you get from shampoo&#x27;s sometimes. I really liked the bottle it came in to, some can be so plain and boring. Not this one, it is very eye friendly and attractive. Wonderful stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo is the most effective product I&#x27;ve used to reduce shedding, stimulate growth, and thicken my previously thinning hair. It isn&#x27;t loaded with a lot of harsh, drying chemicals or greasy oils that weigh hair down so it looks full, healthy, and freshly washed all day. Two of my favorite aspects of this product are that I started seeing results quickly and that it&#x27;s fast and easy to use daily, unlike multi-step alternatives. The scent is also nice; it isn&#x27;t overpowering or medicinal. Also, when it comes to the effectiveness of hair loss and recovery products, the quality of the ingredients used in the formula is as important as the ingredients themselves, which is what makes Hair Surge a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key ingredients are caffeine, ketoconazole, and saw palmetto. In summary, the caffeine works to stimulate growth and promotes healthy hair, ketoconazole is a powerful anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory that treats dandruff and thinning hair, and saw palmetto blocks the enzyme that is known to be a major cause of baldness in both men and women. These ingredients work together to visibly improve vitality and hair and scalp quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I started using Hair Surge. I would highly recommend it to both men and women who want to prevent hair loss, stimulate growth, and maintain healthy, full hair!</li>
    <li> Simply put miracle in a bottle. the fact is that this shampoo was top rated shampoo for hair regrowth. I absolutely love every thing about this shampoo I am big on health this shampoo contains caffeine compounds and if you are some one that has been doing your research you will know that caffeine is used to block testosterone and promotes healthy hair growth.   I love this shampoo I definitely recommend it to everyone both men and women.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I was a skeptic Initially, after I had tried products like Mane And Tail, organic shampoos, and even the widely discussed Wen formulated by the makers of proactiv. But I remember my ideals that cause you&#x27;ve tried a few doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ve tried them all. Then I came across Ultrax Labs Hair Surge, Wow; was my first thoughts with only having used the product for a week and a half my thin spots were showing tremendous improvement! In the conclusion of three weeks my concerned areas were showing greater potential than my non-problem areas! All I can say is pass it on to the next one!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first but this shampoo really works!!!  And it works fast!  I love the way it lathers and  it smells great. WELL worth the money.</li>
    <li> After years of watching my hair shed out I found this product.  Immediately after the first use I noticed that the hair in my sink was drastically reduced.  Ultrax growth stimulating shampoo seems to be doing as stated. The shampoo has a pleasant scent and although it might not lather as most shampoos it certainly makes your scalp tingle with that clean feel.</li>
    <li> I am diabetic and used to be a smoker. In addition, I have been dying my hair since I was 8 years old. To say the least, my hair has seen better days. When I saw this product,  I was so excited! I thought this is better than a pill because I don&#x27;t have to be afraid that I will grow unwanted hair in other places. So I purchased this product. I am so happy with the results and will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s a cure for male pattern baldness but my hair IS fuller elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Using in combo with Natrol Biotin 10,000 mcg...either it&#x27;s my imagination or this stuff is making my hair thicker!!!</li>
    <li> After researching the effectiveness of this products&#x27; active ingredients (microblend caffeine and Ketonconazole) I decided to invest in a bottle. I take a medication which unfortunately has hair loss listed as a side effect. Before using this shampoo I was horrified at the amount of hair I was losing with each wash and when I combed my hair. Since using this product my hair is no longer coming out in clumps. I can see fine baby hairs sprouting and notice an increase in my hair&#x27;s volume. While it is a bit pricey, I will definitely purchase another bottle before this one is empty. I am extremely happy with this product!</li>
    <li> The Shampoo has a lot of great qualities and it definitely does its job by strengthening and freshening my hair. Also the service and speed was off the charts. The only thing that would have made the product better would have been some better and less conflicting ingredients. Some of the sulfates in the shampoo are not the healthiest for hair scalp. But overall, I am left really happy with the experience!</li>
    <li> Like the effects of the shampoo. Leaves my hair shiny and silky.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days but it seems to be making some difference in the hair fall.  Will continue to use the entire bottle and see after that. Shampoo smells nice and lathers fairly well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very surprised to see so many 5 star reviews on this product. It either really works for some people, or there are a lot of phony reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product as directed for over 30 days and I have seen no difference in my hair. I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great. It really does what it needs to and helps the regrowth of hair, and works well as a shampoo. Leaves hair feeling nice and smelling good and leaves you feeling confident.</li>
    <li> To begin with let me say I&#x27;m amazed with this product! I&#x27;ve been in the process of loosing my hair since my early twenties and after trying many products never expected one to work. The first thing I noticed was significant slow down of shedding, my remaining hair seems in better health and even a little fuller. The shampoo lathers okay and it goes on nicely rinsing clean. So far so good I thought, I was pleasantly surprised when after only 10 days of use hairs I hadn&#x27;t seen grow for a decade started to come back! I&#x27;m thinking it may be a little early to tell just how much I&#x27;ll regain but I&#x27;m excited and optimistic to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrapping things up I can say that this product has given me hope for the first time in years. I only wish I had access to this years ago so I could of stopped the hair-loss in it&#x27;s tracks! I recommend this to anyone with hair-loss. I especially recommend this to someone just starting to lose hair, I believe they can avoid losing it all!</li>
    <li> I have to give 5 stars!!!! I&#x27;ve had the shampoo for a week and I must say that my hair looks and feels thicker.  I like the way it tingles in my hair.  I have three kids and they sucked the life out of me.  Two years later my hair has not been the same.  This shampoo has made a huge difference in one week and I hope it continues and stays!!! We all know how important hair is to a young mom in her 30&#x27;s is :).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week, and my hair is fuller and there is less shedding. Started noticing a difference in the shedding around day 3. I&#x27;m definitely a shedder, and I love how this product makes my hair thick and lustrous. I also love how simple it is.&lt;br /&gt;  This bottle will last a long, so it is definitely worth the price. I&#x27;m excited to continue to see results.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I didn&#x27;t think it would work so fast but I can definitely see less hair loss noticed it within the 3rd time of using it. My scalp and hair feel squeaky clean. It feels a bit drying but I use conditioner and it takes the  dryness away. also, the waxy buildup on my scalp it gone. Its been less then a week. I&#x27;m gonna continue to use this I hope to see regrowth!</li>
    <li> Hair Surge is like a miracle cure for helping prevent hair loss! It&#x27;s affordable, especially compared to many others that claim to offer similar benefits, and actually delivers on its promise! I have seen a noticeable reduction in the amount of shedding in my hair. I have tried so many anti-hair loss shampoos and treatments and wasted tons of money. As a female with fine, thinning hair, I&#x27;ve tried and researched hundreds of products with very little results worthy of a review, until now. Caffeine really stimulates hair growth. It may not give me a bombshell thick head of hair but it leaves my hair looking noticeably healthier, with more volume and a nicer, more manageable texture. It&#x27;s super easy to use and the pump allows for easy dispensing. If keeping your hair is as important to you as it is to me, I&#x27;d give this a go. There&#x27;s nothing to lose and maybe some hair to gain!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that REALLY WORKS.  I am very impressed with it, and have seen such great results. Definitely worth the money, I would recommend it to everyone, not just those with hair loss.  It has made my hair exceptionally healthy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a week and I&#x27;m already noticing my hair feeling a lot healthier. It&#x27;s smoother and not as dry anymore. I will definitely continue buying this product.</li>
    <li> Not gonna lie....I was a skeptic. I seriously gave this product a huge question mark while reading about the &amp;#34;caffeine induced stimulating&#x27; ingredients, also even after the initial purchase. Woke me up &amp; its so Energizing! I have thinning hair &amp; now it just seems so much fuller. Less hair in my hairbrush and no hiding balding spots around the temple areas. My follicles seem stronger &amp; for the price, the small amounts that I use definitely goes a long way. On my second bottle and proud of the how rewarding this product works for me.</li>
    <li> I really put this product to the test! I had not only my girlfriend test it out but also my room mate who has thinning hair and is balding. The results were fantastic! My girlfriend was ecstatic about how much healthier and fuller her hair felt, as well as seeming much more vibrant and having a more noticeable natural shine. As for my room mate he used this product religiously 5 times a week as recommended. Although it helped with his  balding hair only minimally after 3 weeks he was experiencing thicker hair all around. I tried this product once before writing this review myself just to see how it felt in the shower, it smells good and lathers very well! Highly recommended for those who want fuller healthier looking hair!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this shampoo, and was excited to start using it.  Sure enough, I have not been mislead, it&#x27;s a great product!  It leaves my hair feeling clean and soft, lathers nicely and smells great.  I can&#x27;t wait to continue to track the progress of my hair, and I highly recommend this for everyone.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed, and I look forward to less shedding and hair growth from using it!</li>
    <li> Ultra Labs Hair Surge Shampoo helped my thinning hair a lot.  hair had thinned really bad from lupus and the shampoo has  helped thickened my hair  whole lot. My hair thickened up around my edges and in the middle of my hair got so full. I would recommend the shampoo to anyone wanting thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Its making my hair have more body, but for the spots i&#x27;m balding at its doing nothing. It smells like eucalyptus which I like, over all it worked for more bolder and thicker hair not used for balding.</li>
    <li> I believe that this shampoo really has made a difference for me. My hair is noticeably thicker.It&#x27;s pricey,,,but if it works, then it&#x27;s worth it!.</li>
    <li> I use this 5 times a week. Results are good. Just give it a month to work !</li>
    <li> Bull...does NOTHING. The only thing surging here is the cost of this crap. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Feels very nice; whether or not its helping with hair growth is yet to be determined, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be able to tell.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any expectations for this product, but boy, am I pleasantly surprised by the results.  I am a female with very long hair and shed a lot.  Not only has there been a reduction in shedding, my hair is very shiny and silky.  It actually feels slightly thicker too.  I don&#x27;t want to sound too vain, but I do feel prettier and more confident with my shiny hair.  I never really had an issue with having bad hair days, but this product brings it over the top.  I have been trying out different shampoos for years in search of the perfect one, but have yet to find one that I truly loved until I came across this one.  One big plus that I noticed also is that my scalp isn&#x27;t as dry, translating into less small dandruff flakes that I tend to get here and there.  Just FYI, I have been using the shampoo 2-3 times a week with 4 pumps since that is how often I wash my hair. The smell is like any other shampoo smell.</li>
    <li> This shampoo caused quite a bit of tangling in my hair.  There was a tingling that bordered on unpleasant, it was almost burning. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell although it was a bit like medicine, and the result was ok.  I guess I&#x27;m one of those people who has an allergic-type reaction to the product, so I can&#x27;t say that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work, just that it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Finished one bottle but No result so far for my hair loss.</li>
    <li> This treatment is a must have. My hair is full and thick, now that I use Ultra Labs product. It has not been long since I started to use It, and I see lasting results. I am very pleased.  I recommend this to anybody looking to grow more hair naturally.</li>
    <li> I tried the Hair Surge Shampoo the other day and was surprised at the very pleasant texture, scent and clear color of the shampoo itself. I didn’t even need to use conditioner, which is always a “must” for me with my generally tangled and difficult hair. I was especially impressed afterward when I had no tangles, pulled the comb straight through my hair without losing or breaking one single strand. Now that is amazing! My hair is thin and wavy but often seems lifeless and dull. Each strand is very thin, very fine and quite weak. Sometimes in the shower I lose clumps but not anymore, not when using Hair Surge Shampoo. My hair felt smooth and each strand felt stronger. I also noticed a slight stimulating kind of shimmer across my head and my partner felt it too, after he shampooed. No more weak, limp, lifeless hair for me! I’m going to keep on using Hair Surge. It definitely makes a difference. If you are seeking hair shampoo that can improve the quality of your hair and stimulate growth then I suggest Hair Surge by Ultrax Labs.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has all the great things you look for with the added bonus of helping to regrow and thicken your hair. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week but it already feels like my hair is a little bit thicker.</li>
    <li> A friend turned me on to this product for my increasing hair loss. I have to admit I was skeptical at first but after a week of use the amount of hair shed was indeed much less. It is the first treatment I have used that works. After two weeks, the hair shedding was to an absolute minimum. I was sold. Each time I use this shampoo I feel great, invigorated and encouraged that my hair loss is being controlled. I absolutely recommend this shampoo and was extremely happy to find it here.</li>
    <li> First impressions matter! Which is why I am giving my initial impressions and review of this product after using this for the past few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the moment I put this product into my hair and begin to lather it, I can immediately feel the &amp;#34;surge&amp;#34;, a slight tingling sensation on my head. The active ingredients in the shampoo get straight to working on improving my hair. Also, I like the clean and refreshing feeling the shampoo has in my hair. Unlike some other shampoos, this one does not get very sudsy and foamy when I lather it in my hair. Some of the other shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the past feels like I&#x27;m putting detergent into my hair because of the foam and bubbles. I appreciate how this shampoo actually makes me feel like I&#x27;m helping and repairing my hair rather than damaging it with harmful &amp;#34;detergent.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Make sure you follow the instructions and lather/leave the shampoo in your hair for 2 minutes before rinsing. I think the reason some people may not be experiencing the effect of the product is because they&#x27;re rinsing it off too quick. The first time I used this, I forgot and rinsed it out of my hair almost immediately, and my hair didn&#x27;t seem much different. But the next day I left it for 2 minutes and I noticed my hair was looking fuller and feeling thicker. Normally, my hair is pretty thin and flat, so I was amazed to look in the mirror and notice my hair actually having volume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure how this product does what it does, but I am satisfied with the results I am seeing. I&#x27;ll have to see what happens to my hair once I run out of this product, but in the meantime, I am going to enjoy my thicker and fuller hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving the scent, and it feels like a great quality product. My hair has a nice sheen after washing. Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination, but I think the caffeine gives me a nice boost in the morning, too!</li>
    <li> I have the usual male pattern baldness setting in - thin in the middle and receeding in the front. I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and have not seen any changes in thickness or new growth. Seems to be a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Product does not stimulate hair growth at all. I used it in conjunction with HairOmega 3-in-1 Dht-blocking vitamins along with Rogaine(that I&#x27;ve been using since 1999 since the start of the loss)for 3 months straight with all products and the hair loss has not lessened. No new hair regrowth. Just another expensive gimmick to give people with hair loss false hope. Unfortunately there is no cure so you might as well save your money.</li>
    <li> Great product! I like the smell of it. I&#x27;m having issues with hair loss and this was recommended to me, so far so good. It&#x27;s really a great product and does what it says! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. My hair has been growing back thicker and fuller and it&#x27;s also helping with my dandruff. It may take some time to see results but is is definitely worth it. The shampoo has a nice scent to it as well.</li>
    <li> Are you suffering from hair loss? Are you tired of trying product after product but seeing no results? Are you fed up with splurging on shampoos that \\&quot;promise\\&quot; to work but come up far too short. Here is you answer! Ultrax Labs has done it again! This shampoo works wonders. There must be magicians working at Ultrax Labs because their products never fail to amaze me. Within 2 weeks you will see results and you will start feeling like a different person. The pump is also ingenious as it ensures no spillage or waste. Thank you Ultrax! I would recommend this product to anyone who is look to combat hair-loss and is on the verge of losing hope. This will work!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo daily for the past week.  It lathers up really well and the smell is great!  I love the fact that the bottle is a pump dispenser so there will be no waste - a really great touch.  From the third use I noticed zero shedding when washing my hair - which is amazing as I usually shed quite a lot when washing my hair.  I am also shedding a lot less when drying my hair (which is coarse and brittle in texture) and have noticed that it feels substantially thicker and less prone to breakage.  I will definitely be using this from now on and will be excited to see the results after a month&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> I used this religiously for 5-6 days a week, leaving it on for 2+ Minutes for weeks and am not convinced I saw any improved growth.  It is really hard to use for long hair because it is extremely low lather.  I also found that after a few weeks it started to cause small breakouts on my scalp and face . . . granted I have sensitive skin to new products but others may experience the same problem.  Sadly for me it was not worth the money and effort.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;m surprised that this shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;mediciny&amp;#34;. I have long curly hair and I usually shed all the time! I have only been using this for a few days and I can already see an improvement. For once I don&#x27;t feel like I am losing half my hair a day.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made me shed more.&lt;br /&gt;Do not believe the 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Most reviews look fake. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I am looking for a product that does act like a shampoo, and prevent hair loss, promote hair growth.  This shampoo does have all the ingredients I am looking for.  I bought this and using it.  I am quite satisfied with.  I would buy this product again and again and apply to my hair to prevent hair loss and promote hair growth on my head.  I would recommend to anybody whoever is interested in.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo but I stopped buying it because of the price you don&#x27;t get much for the price and also has sis which I&#x27;ve been told isn&#x27;t s good ingredient so now I ise exclusively pura D Or</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture of this shampoo! The caffeine stimulates hair growth and leaves hair fuller, shiner and super clean.</li>
    <li> Awesome Stuff!! I have fine hair  and very straight. I used to have to use a Curling Iron or blow dryer just to give me &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34;. .This stuff It made my hair very lush and soft and bouncy. And a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Hair Surge it is suprisingly Moisturizing and leaves my hair Very Full  with lots of body and--after only four days of use, it&#x27;s like I have NEW HAIR!!!&lt;br /&gt;I feel (&amp; it looks like) I&#x27;ve grown tens of thousands of new hairs~it really works, even after my first use I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Used this product exactly like the direction told me to but no improvement. The smell is bit strange also.</li>
    <li> Works great on thinning and brittle hair. No horrible smell either! Will recommend.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful!! Within a week of using it my hair feels thicker and smoother. Using this shampoo I have had less hair loss. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product consistently for two weeks and I have noticed that my hair has grown in length and it is a little thicker. I even applied a small amount to my eyebrows and noticed some hair sprout in. This is super exciting because my eyebrows are thin and I have been trying to grow them out for a long time. The only downside is that this product doesn&#x27;t lather to well, which is ok if it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Ive used this product for the first time, it&#x27;s still too early for results but as far as texture and shine, I love this! My hair feels super soft &amp; it has a nice shine to it. I really like this product. Definitely a great recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several days and its been an astounding experience! I&#x27;ve never felt my follicles so stimulated before! The caffeine extracts in this shampoo makes all the difference. Such sheen and shine! I&#x27;ve definitely noticed some hair growth within several days. Awesome product!!!!</li>
    <li> I started using this product as soon as I heard my neighbors testimonal. She was noticing bald spots and thinner hair follicules near her crown and asked her hair stylist for advice. Just after a few weeks of using the product she saw a tremendous difference. She immediately told me and I&#x27;ve been a fan ever since. The smell is fresh and easy to bear. I apply it then rinse it off after 10-15 mins and carry on with my active daily schedule. I can notice new hairs growing on my edges and most importantly near my crown which most recently suffered a large amount of breakage due to extensions.. I&#x27;m excited to see my growth a few months from now!</li>
    <li> Design: The bottle is all black type 2 recyclable plastic sporting a catchy label on the front. On the reverse is a more technical label with directions and ingredients. The pump is perhaps cheap, but functional. At 8oz the bottle is quite slim; it will easily fit with the rest of your shower items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function: The instructions indicate that this shampoo should be used five times per week, and the two pumps worth left in a couple minutes before being rinsed. I can say that following those instructions definitely produced the best results. I found it to be especially important to make sure and leave it in for the couple minutes. Usually I applied it first and rinsed it last in my shower routine. I find the smell pleasing. It lathers up nice, not super foamy like many shampoos. After using it my hair feels clean and really does feel fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance: As with any product like this, it&#x27;s difficult to tell if and how much it&#x27;s working. I really do think that it is helping, but it&#x27;s also not the only thing I&#x27;m using. I can say with certainty, however, that it does wonders for the thickness and fullness of my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 31 year old extremely healthy vegan female with a skin condition. Recently I&#x27;ve been experiencing shedding and dandruff so I wanted to try a stimulating shampoo. The price was way above what I wanted to pay, but my hair was more important so I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo does not lather the way other shampoos do.My hair is loc&#x27;ed so I shampoo once per week as opposed to every day as suggested. I have seen great results! After a few days the shedding was noticeably less. I&#x27;ve also noticed the hair seems thicker which is wonderful, especially around my hairline. Although I do not suffer from outright hair loss, thicker hair helps me to feel comfortable that the hairline won&#x27;t go thin anytime soon. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  A friend recommended it, and after using it every day got about a week, I&#x27;ve noticed fuller, healthier hair.  It smells good and it&#x27;s the best product of its kind that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This product has been really helpful for my hair and my confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed an impact already, nothing huge yet but my hair feels fuller and I see less falling out!  Again, this product is helping me take more control over my appearance so I can&#x27;t be more thankful a solution exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t lather too much, but based on other reviews and some Google searching, that is a good thing for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good scent to the product, I leave the shower feeling fresh overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> After using for over one month I could not see any difference , I actually broke out very bad around my forehead. I wish I could return but its to late.</li>
    <li> So I have been trying to find a product that would salvage my hair for a while now. I have been thinning for the past 2 years now, but I have been apprehensive to shell out a load of money for a product that I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure about. I came across Ultrax Labs Hair Surge and decided to give it a try, because I was confident in the shampoo&#x27;s active ingredients. (I have used coffee in the past to make my plants grow faster, so it just made sense that coffee may be able to help my hair!) I followed the directions, massaging the shampoo into my scalp for about 3 minutes, 5 times a day, and after the first month I began to notice some results! I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product my hair feels thicker and stronger! But even more miraculous is the resurgence of hair at my nape where I have been experiencing hair loss from pulling my ponytails up so tight, also leaves my hair feeling so healthy and manageable, i highly recommend. Be diligent with this and you will be rewarded. Absolutely great product. Buy it!</li>
    <li> My hair is still The same but improved or better, it cured my dandruff.</li>
    <li> After a significant weight loss and two pregnancies my hair has seen better days. I have more fall out then I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that&#x27;s safe and effective AND THIS IS IT!! Smells great and leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth. Other products I&#x27;ve used in the past smelled horrible and were not something I could handle using on a regular basis (or in the place of my daily washout). I am so glad I bought and tried this, it&#x27;s really made a huge difference in the life of my hair. Will without a doubt be ordering more!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is like morning coffee for your scalp. I felt a tingling during my first use. Hopefully thats&#x27;s a sign of good things to come.</li>
    <li> I bought this through Beauty Superstore Plus. I love this product! First off It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor like some hair growth shampoos. It feels good and stimulating on the scalp and feels very refreshing, which is probably from the mint oil. My hair feels great after every use and i can feel a difference in the thickness for sure. And after a lot of research i was happy to find that this shampoo has a main ingredient that has been proven to help with hair thinning and loss which is the ketoconazole. But it also has many other ingredients that are helpful as well. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome. It grows your hair faster than it even says.  It reduces shedding more than I thought it would.  I have a slight bald spot on the side of my head and I can see new growth already.  It&#x27;s only been 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve been using it and this is definitely going to be my new shampoo of choice.  I&#x27;m excited to see what it&#x27;s going to do in a month!</li>
    <li> This shampoo comes in a black, standard pump bottle for easy access in the shower.  The shampoo itself has no color. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; and contains compounds known to help with follicle health and other scalp issues that may impede hair growth such as caffeine, saw palmetto, ketoconazole and panthenol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caffeine stimulates follicles, increases blood flow to the scalp and blocks DHT. Saw Palmetto also prevents DHT from attacking hair follicles. Ketoconazole is an anti-fungal compound and panthenol is a vitamin B derivative that thickens and moisturizes hair. These active ingredients address a solid range of hair growth challenges, so I feel that it&#x27;s a good formulation. With that said, it has a scent, but it is very light and somewhat pleasant, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about your hair smelling like a medicine chest with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a really nice consistency and produces a rich lather.  Upon working up a lather and letting it sit on my scalp as instructed, I noticed a refreshing tingle. I also felt my scalp lightly pulsate for a minute, like there was increased blood flow on the top of my head.  I have sensitive skin, and it didn&#x27;t irritate me at all.  After use, my hair was truly &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.  I could still faintly smell its scent in my hair after it was conditioned and dried, but since it&#x27;s very light, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I can&#x27;t wait for my boosted hair growth!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome! Let me just start of by saying that I have had issues with hair falling out in clumps since giving birth. I have tried many things to help me with my hair loss and thinning hair, from natural remedies to pills, and so far this is the only product that has made a real difference. From the first time I washed my hair, I noticed right away that it looked and felt much thicker. I also noticed a lot less of hair falling out in the shower, yay! I am really happy that this is geared towards women as well, since most hair growth products are geared towards men,so my insecurities as a woman suffering from hair loss subsided. I also thought that since it is made using caffeine, it would have a strong smell, but surprisingly it smells very nice and refreshing. It also feels refreshing too since it has almost a cooling effect once applied. It is definitely well worth the money spent. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase and I plan on using this shampoo for a while, until my hair returns to it&#x27;s full former glory, which I am sure it has since this shampoo has already made such a difference.</li>
    <li> A few uses in and you can already see the progress this shampoo does to your hair. It&#x27;s great, it helps with hair loss, it doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell, and it works up a nice lather. Not going to lie I was a bit wary of this shampoo when I first read about it but it was definitely worth every dollar I spent. I am so pleased with what it&#x27;s doing with my hair! My hair looks so much healthier and no more shedding for me!! Yay!</li>
    <li> I was just like others when trying different products. Being in my 20s , I&#x27;m already showing signs of balding. Trying to avoid all that I decided to check this out.    So far I have not been dissapointed. I&#x27;ve been using Ultrax for almost 3 weeks and my hair has been growing thicker. I haven&#x27;t seen a huge improvement in the most problem bald spot, but there is an improvement.    Bottom line, I&#x27;m seeing the results that I have been wanting. I&#x27;m convinced that it will solve my thinning and balding problem.    Next step is to see how my hair looks after getting a hair cut.</li>
    <li> First I have to mention the speedy delivery I have never received a product so fast! Love it, after one use my hair already feels fuller.  This product makes my hair feel fuller and stronger.  Love it!  Highly recommend for others with thin hair.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, as described, but do not expect a wonderful fragrant smell or lots of lather because it does not lather like regular shampoo. I have used this product since I received it and have seen a significant decrease in shedding of my hair when i wash it. My hair also feels thicker than before and I have notice new hair growth which I had not experiencing prior to using this shampoo. Overall, I am extremely satisfied and exciting with the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just not working. I wasted over 40 dollars on nothing.... Very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I have always had slow growing hair and tried all the different stimulating products to help my hair grow faster and stronger.  This is by far the best hair growth shampoo I have tried!  I have definitely seen a difference in shedding when I brush my hair, and less breakage since I do color my hair as well.  I don&#x27;t follow the instructions of 5X a week because i don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, but nonetheless, I have experienced a difference in texture and strength!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually recommended my mother to start using this shampoo as well!</li>
    <li> This product is great! As soon as I started to use it I had more volume in my hair! After using it for a few weeks it seems as though my hair growth has increased and I have less noticeable balding patches. It also leaves my hair and scalp feeling clean and there is no overbearing scent associated with it. I would defiantly recommend giving this product a try because I did have a noticeable improvement and fuller hair after use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 5 days a week as directed along with the hair lush daily. I used the product as directed and this product has had no effect at all. The 5 star reviews seem a little suspicious as other users have pointed out.</li>
    <li> quick delivery, nice size bottle (worth the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just starting using product, smells good. hoping my hair gets thicker based on other write ups. liked the look both curly and straight, feels good after using so much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on looking into ultrax other products.</li>
    <li> I used to wear braids over the years and they caused my hair to break off around the edges, so I was in desperate need of something to help fix the problem. I am not a fan of taking pills and with some many, I wasn&#x27;t sure which to choose. While in a store, someone recommended this shampoo to me. It&#x27;s a bit pricey and I was very skeptical about purchasing it, but only after a couple of washes, I already notice a difference. I can&#x27;t wait to put a month&#x27;s worth of time in to see the results. Looking to buy again.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Having a pump in the shower is super convenient, made my wife&#x27;s hair feel thicker after just 2 days!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because my hair is thin and tends to shed a lot which I hate because it makes me feel like I&#x27;m going bald. I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will make my hair grow fuller and this is it. I was looking into using hair growth pills but I did not want to risk having side effects so this is really the best thing. So far I&#x27;ve used the shampoo for two weeks and I really feel my hair growing in so much fuller it&#x27;s even noticeable! I think the more you use it the better but I tend to wash my hair every two days and the shampoo has still really made a difference so far. I can&#x27;t wait to see my hair a month or two from now. I really recommend this to any ladies that want to have fuller and healthier hair, who doesn&#x27;t want that! (It&#x27;s 8 oz by the way.)</li>
    <li> I love this product. After trying many other products and being disappointed I tried Ultrax. My hair is important to me and keeping it is even more important. Many products I&#x27;ve tried dull the appearance of my hair. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my hair growth and the quality of my hair. So long are the days where I will wonder what I will get next! I definitely recommend Ultrax Labs. No longer will I only be putting caffeine in my mouth! Thanks Ultrax Labs!</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair but after using this shampoo, my hair actually feels thicker &amp; fuller to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t think that could really happen with the use of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been proven wrong.</li>
    <li> Hello, I am a 48 year old African American woman, with thick and natural hair but thinning a little bit, and also have my hairline is slightly thin on the left and right due to tension from braiding. I have tried some hair growth products, and it is ok, so I figure I&#x27;ll try this. So far, I like it, and amazingly I see some results. It&#x27;s slowly but surely, but I&#x27;m glad that it is working, even having taking a chance to make a pricey purchase. It has a nice smell, lather is good,may have to use more shampoo though depending on how thick your hair is. Follow the directions for optimum results. It also contains Menthol, which is like a stimulating ingredient that helps, you would feel it. I would probably get better results but being an African American woman washing my hair everyday would be a lot of work, as I&#x27;ve mentioned that my hair is natural and even with natural hair it still has to be maintain constantly and I have a busy schedule. But I recommend it, would buy again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome! Let me just start of by saying that I have had issues with hair falling out in clumps since giving birth.

    <li> After using several other products from Ultrax Labs with great results, I decided to spring for the shampoo and give it a try. I have been experiencing hair loss for a couple of years (hormone related). I wasn&#x27;t sure what to do to help my hair get healthier and grow back again. I&#x27;ve tried other products from this same company and liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it is the caffeine that makes the hair start to grow again... but whatever the combo is, it works. I recommend this product for anyone who wants to get their hair back! It&#x27;s embarassing to have thinning hair. Even though this product is a little expensive, I think it&#x27;s worth it. I only wash my hair 2-3 times per week, and I still see results... new hair growth. Plus it does make my hair feel soft!</li>
    <li> This is a bad product with fictional reviews. It does absolutely nothing. Do not buy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well. I&#x27;m no longer losing so much hair whenever I wash/brush it. It leaves my hair healthy &amp; more beautiful!</li>
    <li> Didnt see any diference</li>
    <li> I really am enjoying this shampoo.  My hair feels thicker and healthier than before.  More importantly, it looks healthier.  Love the smell of it too!</li>
    <li> So I was skeptical buying this product, but that all changed once it started to really work! It took a very short time for the Ultrax formula to stop my hair from shedding. Gone were the random hairs on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product that I would suggest for anyone with hair issues!</li>
    <li> Hair surge is a powerful shampoo that has strengthened my hair even after the first use. When applied, it gives you a gentle lather. My scalp had no negative reactions whatsoever. It does have a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Happy I bought this shampoo product to revitalize my hair. A recent perm weakened my hair and caused some fallout. After 2 uses of surge shampoo I have noticed increased softness and significantly less fallout. It even repaired my damaged hair. I cant wait to continue to use this product to get additional benefits for my hair.</li>
    <li> I too love this product! I have always had very thin, constant shedding and slow growing hair. Since using this shampoo I have noticed a significant difference in my hair.  I can actually run a brush through my hair without any of it falling out. I get out of my car without seeing pieces of my hair literally all over the place. My friends would always make fun of the fact that my hair would be all over their car seats after me riding with them and though I joked about it I was very embarrassed. I can happily say that is no longer an issue. I actually receive a lot of compliments on how good my hair looks and I love it!! This truly is an amazing shampoo with actual results that live up to its name. I have found Ultrax to have great products that work. I actually came across another Ultrax product a little over a month ago that I would highly recommend using with this shampoo. It&#x27;s called Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement. It&#x27;s actually on sale right now I paid a lot more for it but I don&#x27;t mind one bit paying for something that actually works, makes me look good and when you look good you just feel good about yourself. Is how I feel anyway!! :)</li>
    <li> Update, been using it for a week now and found that my hair feels thicker and I have not been losing as much hair as I was before.  I used to run my fingers through my hair and come out with a handful but now its only 1 or 2 hairs and that&#x27;s Awesome!    I&#x27;m growing out my gray hair and so far have about 4 inches of gray and about 2 inches of color left and this is going to get me on my way to all gray much quicker and I&#x27;m so glad as my gray/silver hair is pretty and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing it all one color again.</li>
    <li> I used the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo five days a week for a couple of weeks. I really enjoyed the thick lather that the shampoo created.  I do feel like I saw a small amount of new growth around the edges of my scalp. I did not feel any tingling, but I do feel like I had a smaller  amount of hair loss after showering. I found the fragrance to be  medicinal, but not offensive.  I will continue to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This caught my eye because of the ingredients touted on the company&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Caffeine - which can help encourage healthy hair growth and extend the life cycle of hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;2) Ketoconazole - which is often found in dandruff shampoos for its anti-inflammatory &amp; anti-fungal properties, but also helps thinning hair (though the site does admit they can&#x27;t explain why exactly).&lt;br /&gt;3) Saw Palmetto - this is a possible 5-alpha-reductase enzyme blocker; this is important because the enzyme facilitates the change of testosterone into DHT which is a major cause of pattern baldness in men &amp; women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I used it:&lt;br /&gt;1) it says to wash your hair 5x, but I don&#x27;t wash my hair that often so I only used it 2x a week&lt;br /&gt;2) the gel is very thick so I used a nickel-sized amount and worked it into my hair from scalp to tips&lt;br /&gt;3) I left the shampoo on for about 3 minutes before rinsing it with cold water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see results in breakage and shedding right away so I gave it about 3 weeks and starting feeling a difference.  My hair does feel better without a lot of buildup and more luxurious. It was worth the money spent!</li>
    <li> Great product.  This shampoo is a great breakthrough for anyone who wants more hair growth. It uses caffeine, ketoconazole which is an anti-inflamatory, and saw palmetto which helps against baldness to give you full bodied hair growth.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. Its helps mantain the health of my hair and promotes new hair growth. It provides nutrients to the scalp essential for healthy hair. The condition of my hair is better since using this product.</li>
    <li> I Use This On My 2 Year Olds Head ! She Has Thin Hair In Some Spots But After Two Weeks Of Use I Already See The Spots Getting Thicker And Healthier. Has Also Helped Me With Shedding ! This Product Is AWESOME !!</li>
    <li> I’m not sure if I notice a significant amount of hair growth yet but I can say I’ve noticed my head of hair seems more full.  It did not happen over night.  I noticed my hair getting fuller and had more body after shampooing with the Ultrax Labs Growth Stimulating Shampoo for about a month.  Having a fuller head of hair makes me happy and more confident.  I also like the fact that all I have to do is use the Ultrax Labs Shampoo as my primary shampoo without taking extra steps.  Because of the positive results, I will continue to use this product.  I look forward to seeing a more full head of hair and anticipate gradual hair growth.  I finally found a hair growth product I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is a review that is somewhat close to my heart, more so than other items I have purchased out here.  You see, two and a half years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  They told me that everything would be fine, I would just have surgery and a little radiation, and go on my way.  Then the tests came back with the news I was dreading to hear, that my cancer was of a type that would require chemotherapy, and Herceptin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you think of is &amp;#34;Am I going to die?&amp;#34;.  After that, &amp;#34;Will I lose my hair?&amp;#34;  if not the number one question, it is still very high on the list for most women.  Hair loss may seem like a very small thing in comparison to all the other things you have to cope with, and many a time I felt like my priorities were out of whack for concerning myself with my hair at such a time, but the reason it&#x27;s so troubling is because one minute you look great and feel ok, and the next your entire self is completely transformed into someone you don&#x27;t recognize.  It&#x27;s very shocking to see your appearance so drastically altered in a matter of weeks, and this transformation drives it home hard that you are really and truly in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;At other times in my life, I faked it until I could make it, spent more attention on my hair and makeup to project an image of health and well being to myself when I looked in the mirror, as I am a strong believer in the connection between PMA and the success of overcoming a life challenge of this sort, but this one... at the end of the day you are taking off your wig and washing off the eyebrows you drew on, and the image coming back to you makes it much harder to realize that one day you will feel and look much better.  After a year of chemo infusions my hair started coming back, and as it started growing in more fully it came back in these beautiful ringlets.  I always wanted curly hair, and enjoyed my beachy ringlets to the max last summer.  It&#x27;s starting to come in much straighter at the roots now though, so I have been pampering what is left of the curls.  I still have to take chemo in a pill form for the next 5 to 10 years, what is known as a hormone blocker.  I started taking the hormone blockers right after the worst of the infusions were over, and it has been very trying to find a hormone blocker that I could actually tolerate in the way of side effects. I&#x27;ve been taking them for a year or so now, and have been noticing various changes.  Now that the curly part is pretty well grown out, and since I have been on the hormone blockers, I have been noticing that my hair seems to be thinning, most noticeably on top and around my forehead.  The main cause of thinning in average  women is hormonal, and with them tinkering with mine, it makes sense to me  that the drugs I take have something to do with it.  While in treatment I of course did numerous web searches to find out if there were any way to get the hair to grow back more quickly.  While searching, I did find quite a few posts on cancer forums to the effect that dandruff shampoos containing Ketoconazole may help to restore one&#x27;s hair after chemo. Before trying this product, I also searched for the role of caffeine in hair growth, and there are actually some studies out there about it.  I find it reassuring that I can find studies on a variety of sites that suggest this formula really could offer a good benefit for hair restoration, so I am hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this treatment for about a week so far, I&#x27;m still getting acquainted with it, but so far so good.  My hair seems fluffier.  I have always had very oily hair, and this stuff seems pretty effective for combating the oil and build up.  The formula is very thick, and I start with wetting my hair down well, and kind of lathering it a bit in my hands before applying.  It doesn&#x27;t lather the way a drug store shampoo does, and I am still trying to work out what would be the best way to use this treatment.  I&#x27;m from the tv generation that grew up being told that the way to use a shampoo is &amp;#34;lather, rinse, repeat&amp;#34;, and with the notion that a shampoo must lather in order to be effective.  I only lather once with this stuff, and leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it out.  I have also tried it by doing one lather with my normal shampoo, and then using the hair surge.  Your mileage may vary :)  I do find that it seems to leave my hair a bit dry, and use some conditioner on the ends so I can comb it out and style it more easily.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like I need to use very much of this at all, and my hair looks good today.  I&#x27;m glad to have given it a try, it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will help my hair grow, but I do find improvement in the fullness and texture of my hair, and can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair is at the end of a month of treatment :)ion that grew up being told that the way to use a shampoo is &amp;#34;lather, rinse, repeat&amp;#34;, and with the notion that a shampoo must lather in order to be effective.

    <li> This shampoo is the best. In only two weeks I noticed less shedding. I am so excited this product is amazing. I have been looking for years for a shampoo that works well for my hair and also promotes healthy strong long hair... This is it! You dont need to use alot every wash so this bottle lasts long. Plus this is great for men to!!!</li>
    <li> No result yet.soo annoying</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My hair has stopped shedding and has gotten thicker and shinier. My bald spots have visibly decreased and I&#x27;m getting compliments from friends and family.</li>
    <li> I was really cautious at first as I thought I might be wasting my money  but for the cost I am more than satisfied with the product. Many of the other products I looked at were far more expensive than this. Overall the experience is great so far and I also truly feeling better about myself with the results. I have not been using it for long but am seeing immediate results. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> For context, I have very short, very thin hair and have small thinning area on top of head.  Altered my routine to wash hair first so product has time to do its work; usually more than 2 minutes before rinsing.  Applied hair conditioner as usual; do use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 7 days, 5 days using Hair Surge, one day off, another day with Hair Surge.&lt;br /&gt;Product is expensive, but, with my type hair, a little goes a long way.  The smell is not very pleasant when first applied, but dissipates rapidly. I don&#x27;t have a problem with inadequate sudsing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not as fly away and my natural curls tighter than with previous shampoos. The thin spot on the top of my head is not as noticeable as it was, after just one week application.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. After just a few washes my hair felt stronger and thicker, and after a few weeks my hair had filled in so much. I am so happy with the results. Now my hair is so much fuller, thicker and longer! It has grown faster than it ever had before.&lt;br /&gt;Also the shampoo smells great and makes my hair easier to style after it air dries. I would recommend it is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs hair surge caffeine growth stimulating shampoo one of the better hair loss treatments out there. I Love this product it does what it says, I was skeptical at first because I tried many other growth stimulant shampoos but after a few uses I noticed a  slight difference in my hair, it has begun to grow back fairly quick  and I love the smell and lather of this product. When applied it feels like it&#x27;s working automatically the tingling is a great feeling to know that there is some activity going on up there. The main ingredients are Caffeine - This has been shown to drastically extend the life cycle of follicles when applied topically.&lt;br /&gt;Ketoconzole - While relatively unheard of, this is a powerful anti-inflammatory and fights thinning.&lt;br /&gt;Saw Palmetto – According to a variety of clinical trials, this has been shown to block an enzyme that converts DHA into testosterone, a leading cause of male and female pattern baldness. So overall I will give it 5 stars and will be buying this item again I am truly satisfied thus far with the results.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for just over a week, but I can tell you I am happy with the way it makes my hair look and feel. It smells fresh and makes my scalp tingle pleasantly as I work the lather into my head. My hair has more body and I am noticing that it feels more full in previously thinning areas. I also notice that I don&#x27;t appear to be shedding as much hair recently as I have in the past. My wife is very pleased with the look and the feel of my hair and says the scent reminds her of the tropics. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who feels their hair is becoming lifeless and thin. In addition, my hair feels cleaner, not as oily as before I started using this product. Kudos to the developers of this fantastic shampoo.</li>
    <li> Before I started using this shampoo about a week ago, I was literally losing clumps of hair in the shower. I was amazed last night when I ran my fingers through my hair after rinsing it and i didn&#x27;t see a single hair! If its working this well the first week, I definitely plan to continue using this product.    Ariell</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. It has indeed worked for me. Be prepared to be somewhat patient, but this coupled with Rogaine has helped my hair loss problem very much. I hope those of you seeking help are able to find it, I know exactly how frustrating hair loss can be. I&#x27;m only 21 but have been dealing with this issue for the last several years. Give Ultrax a shot.</li>
    <li> I just received my order for the HAIR SURGE SHAMPOO and the HAIR SOLAGE CONDITIONER.  So far I&#x27;ve only used them twice so can&#x27;t say anything about their hair regrowth ability.  As a shampoo and conditioner they seem to clean and condition very well and seem to have just a tiny bit of almost unnoticeable fragrance.  I will keep using them for a while.&lt;br /&gt;However, I would NOT RECOMMEND them to anybody who has very fine, straight hair like mine.  The shampoo and conditioner used together make my hair so soft and shiny that it is actually limp and has no body at all.  I am going to try using a spray on bodifier before I style my hair next time to see if it helps.  I think this shampoo conditioner combination would be fantastic for someone with thicker or naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!  I GOT MY HAIR BACK!!</li>
    <li> Works, but takes a while. Works best when used in tandem with other minoxodil products, and DHT blocking supplements.</li>
    <li> The shampoo almost reminds me of wen. it&#x27;s gentle on hair, doesn&#x27;t form too much foam and bubbles or have harsh chemicals that attack your hair. you massage your scalp for 3-5 mins and rinse. Afterwards it feels smooth and volumized. You don&#x27;t need to use alot each time, just 2 pumps or so.It definitely stimulates hair growth and give your current hair more volume/strength. If you don&#x27;t want to invest thousands of dollars with hair implants and other invasive procedures, you should try this!</li>
    <li> My hair has been falling out and breaking for years. I’ve tried so many products with very little if any results…until HAIR SURGE!! I‘m so happy, this shampoo works. I noticed a difference the very first use, my hair was softer, shinier and, now after just one week of use I can see my hair getting thicker, YAY! Also, to my surprise my normal fizzy looking curls are smooth. I will definitely be looking into other accompanying products by Ultax Labs. Thank you for making me prettier. Sincerely, Tess</li>
    <li> I tried many know brands for my hair strength but it wasn&#x27;t working. My friend was using this product and he advised me to use this. I was able to see my hair gaining strength and also feels soft within a month. I&#x27;m happy i found this awesome product! high five to my friend and the product!! :)</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this shampoo. It is not overly sweet and cloying like a lot of shampoos and it is not super medicinal like other &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; shampoo. It does have an herbal scent but it was not overpowering. My scalp felt pretty clean after I used it. I would there were not  a bunch of suds like I am used to but it still effectively cleaned my scalp and hair. My hair felt thicker after I used it which my previous shampoo did not really do for me. It felt moisturized and clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Shampoo for a couple of weeks now.  It is a clear shampoo with a mild fragrance.  It has made my hair softer and thicker and reduced hair breakage.  It has also gotten rid of my itchy scalp.  I leave the shampoo in my hair for 2 to 3 minutes before rinsing it out in order to get the most benefit from the product. My hair loss has greatly decreased and I am delighted with my hair appearing thicker, softer, and more manageable.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical when I bought it. I still have a pretty full head of hair but a receding hairline is why I decided to try it. This is now my second order because I did notice some new growth along my forehead. My natural color is there as well (not sure if the shampoo has anything to do with that though) so I am hoping it may be a side effect that will help me keep my natural color longer.</li>
    <li> Did not do anything at all for me..</li>
    <li> As with  any  product, this  does not work overnight. However , it works wonders!!! I have thick curly hair and for the  past few years my hair has been falling out then I found this product and I must admit it&#x27;s amazing. After several washes,  I noticed there is less falling out and breakage. My hair is noticeably healthier and stronger.  This is an amazing product and I would recommend to anyone choosing to have their full healthy hair back..</li>
    <li> I love this product. I purchased this product to combat my shedding and increase growth. After just a few uses my hair definitely feels thicker and the shedding has stopped. I love the light sent of this shampoo as well. I purchased this product from Beauty Superstore Plus and shipping was fast and easy my product arrived super quick. I definitely recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> LOVE this!!! 6 months after my baby was born I ordered this to fix the bald spots hormones caused. Within a month I saw noticeable results and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results (:</li>
    <li> Excellent Product! I Have Seen A Tremendous Difference In My Hair. I Love Ultra Labs Hair Products &amp; &amp;&amp; I Highly Recommend It Especially Combined w/ The Conditioner &amp; Thickening Serum!!!</li>
    <li> This product leaves my hair very manageable, has a nice lather and smells good. I can&#x27;t wait to see my long term results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it less than two weeks but already I appear to have less shedding. I only shampoo every 2 to 3 days so I&#x27;m please so far with how this is panning out. My shedding has been an issue for the past year. And I have tried everything to make it stop. I&#x27;m in week 2 and I&#x27;m seeing considerably less shedding. This is significant being that my shedding has been extreme. I only shampoo twice a week. I will start following their directions of 5 x a week. So far so go. I would say please give this product a try if want to see immediate results.</li>
    <li> Extremely expensive tiny bottle (8oz) that does not work.  Any positive results are probably because the customers want to see them, but are not actually seeing any.</li>
    <li> I really like how there is no fragrance, other shampoos I have used to stimulate my scalp &amp; promote healthy hair smell like a treatment shampoo, very unpleasant.The first time I used it, I already felt a difference in my hair. It felt silky, healthy and was visibly fuller, my friends even noticed!</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair last summer due to two major surgeries. I was sick because I held on to my hair and I was 59 at the time.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it works!! I have been using this shampoo since last summer and it is returning my hair to it&#x27;s former thickness.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell, it cools you scalp and leaves your hair squeaky clean which is important when you have thinning hair, you don&#x27;t want anything to weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;Use this along with their hair thickening formula and your hair looks great!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to help with thinning hair and hair loss.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 months.  It does help with making my hair thicker - I can actually see the difference in the thickness of the individual strands.  However, it has not done anything to help regrow hair, or reduce my hair loss.  What others have posted about it not lathering much is true.  I just shampoo first with my normal shampoo and do a second round with this one.  It doesn&#x27;t take much then and it lathers up nice.  I let it set in my hair for about 2 minutes before rinsing.  The smell is ok.  When it runs out, I probably won&#x27;t reorder.  It&#x27;s expensive for such a little bottle and it doesn&#x27;t fully meet my needs.</li>
    <li> Just received this product and after one use I can definitely say that I am optimistic about using it. It has a cool but comforting sensation upon application. The consistency is not too heavy and the fragrance is pleasant and not overpowering.  Some of the active ingredients include: Caffeine, Ketoconazole, and Saw Palmetto all which have powerful anti-inflammatory and DHT blocking properties which can facilitate hair growth. I will give an update in about 6 weeks of consistent use, but after researching some of the main ingredients, there is definite clinical science that give reasons for trying this product.</li>
    <li> as im getting older I ran out of ideas of growing back my hair I have purchased many shampoos through the years to help my thinning and this is been by far the best and really feel it working and making my hair look and feel thicker!! 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works or my hear is slowly regenerating on its own!  :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to believe that it&#x27;s working! Plus I think that a slow regeneration is much more stable than fast regeneration. I&#x27;ve been using one for 8 mouths (have very short hair) and I&#x27;ve seen progress but again it didn&#x27;t happen in a day.</li>
    <li> First, what makes this shampoo the best is that makes your hair strong. Second, it prevents that your hair begins to fall again and again.  I combine it with good vitamins, a healthy diet and exercising and has and magnificent effect.  Well.. I am very happy because it is preventing my hair to fall again, my hair fells very thick and now I am not afraid to comb my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Not only helps with hair loss by stopping shedding and promoting growth but also leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.  This shampoo is gentle yet very effective in improving the quality of your hair.  I definitely would recommend this shampoo for those looking to prevent the process of thinning hair, hair loss, and potential baldness while improving the overall health of their hair.  Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo delivers on what it promises.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is different than others. I have thin hair and after using this shampoo my hair feels less dry and more fuller. Most shampoos make my hair feel thin and dry but not this one. It&#x27;s a treatment shampoo that left my hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> So I have been using this product for a few weeks.  I am beginning to see immediate change in my hair that was also noticeable to others. My hair is fuller, healthier and shinier! I also see lots of new hair growth where it began to thin. I&#x27;m amazed at how fast I saw results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any positive impacts with this product. It was a waste of my money. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> OK so I have used the product for the first time not overly scented which can be good or bad depending on your preference (for me that is fine). I am a male with long hair and most of my friends have been thinning or having balding issues (I have not Thank God)&lt;br /&gt;That said I did notice on the sides of my head my hair does not seem as thick and my Hair grows at a slower rate than before.&lt;br /&gt;This Product seemed to clean my head and scalp very well. I have read about some of the ingredients and their effectiveness in Haircare.(stimulate hair growth and block effects of testosterone within the skin) sounds great to me. I do use a leave -in condition for more control after shampooing. I think this product would be great paired with a healthy conditioner for those with Dry hair. I am looking forward to the days ahead to see the difference it can make. It is a Little pricey for a small Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looked great after it dried</li>
    <li> I been experiencing hair loss around the crown and embarassing excessive hair shedding l. When i wash my hair there&#x27;s hair against the shower walls and clumps in the drain. When combing there&#x27;s hair on the sink, around my back, and neck. I started using Ultra Labs Hair Surge Caffeinated Shampoo and have noticed my hair is getting thicker and no longer falling out. I only use 2 to 3 pumps to lather my hair which feels so soft and refreshed. I air dry and go on my way. I like this product--it has saved me from embarassing hair shedding where ever I go and having to excuse myself to others who find hair where I&#x27;ve been.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been afflicted with alopecia for most of my life so unfortunately, I am used to randomly losing gigantic patches of hair.  I was a little taken aback by the price of this shampoo when it was first recommended to me by a friend, but I feel like my scalp is worth the investment so I took the plunge and am so glad I did!!  As it has only been several weeks since I started using this shampoo, it is too early to tell if the baby hairs growing I see are a direct result of using this shampoo BUT all of the other effects I&#x27;ve seen are definitely worth the price I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My typically fine hair just LOOKS more voluminous and feels thicker after I use this shampoo so it seems like I have a lot more hair than I really do.  I was so pleased when my friend&#x27;s hairstylist mother looked at my hair at a party the other night and said she loved my &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34;…I had to explain that it had to be my new Ultrax shampoo because I had not blown out my hair!!  Another bonus is that my scalp is not as itchy or flaky since I&#x27;ve been using this product.  I also see less hair in the drain after shampoos so I&#x27;m definitely not losing as much hair as before.  Since I do battle so much hair loss, I tend not to shampoo my hair more than a couple times a week so often my hair can look kinda oily.  But I&#x27;ve noticed that with this shampoo, my scalp is not producing as much oil so my hair looks fresher for longer in between washes…and that type of convenience and luxury is golden for me!!!</li>
    <li> Ultra Labs Hair Surge is a great shampoo. It has a great scent, a cooling sensation that feels great on the scalp, and if you&#x27;re patient you&#x27;ll see the results it promises.</li>
    <li> My mother often complained about her hair loss and emphasized how uncomfortable it made her feel. After researching some products to help her issue, I came across the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo, and gifted it for my mother. Now all she does is talk about the wonders this product does for her hair and constantly thanks me for it! Im so glad this product has helped her! Her hair feels thicker and sheds less. She lovesss it.</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with my hair I wait to get this.I know its gone to be great.</li>
    <li> Love the product!!! My hair feels softer and looks fooler. It smells wonderful and it&#x27;s not thick lke other products. I would recommend to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> Though I have only been using this shampoo for a couple of weeks, I already love it. I am already finding a lot less hair in my brush every day. I am sure that I am losing a lot less hair each day thanks to this shampoo. My hair feels and looks so much fuller. I am excited to see what will happen after using it longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product less than a month, but i&#x27;ve could notified some improvements in my hair. For example after showers i don&#x27;t have to clean out after me which means that this has stopped my hair loss. Until now i haven&#x27;t seen my hair regrowth, maybe it&#x27;s too soon, but i&#x27;m quite satisfied because it looks healthy. Ultrax Labs contains caffeine components which seem be effective for the hair loss. For the moment i&#x27;ll keep using.</li>
    <li> I have fine, shoulder length hair. Last few months it&#x27;s been getting a bit more thin and receding. I have tried various hair thickners and treatments; yet my hairbrush is full and still a sinkful of hair, let alone my pillows! I&#x27;m glad that I came across this Ultrax Lab Hair Surge, because not only has this product made my hair more fuller; it also brings out some shine!! I have dark golden brown hair and can&#x27;t believe how much nicer &amp; bouncy my hair is!! The past week and 1/2 here in Chicago has been extremely muggy (which usually means bad hair days) You&#x27;ll have better hair  days and be less self-conscious because this shampoo is an instant bang!!! I&#x27;m loving my hair again!!! I&#x27;m so happy!!! Enjoy!!!  P.S. my guy uses this as well; he&#x27;s 43 &amp; has the receding hair lines and bald spot on top; less noticeable and he hasn&#x27;t been wearing his b-caps!!</li>
    <li> It working best  love hair</li>
    <li> I received shampoo conditioner and the hair lush yesterday but the quantity or the size of the bottles was a total surprise. Hope it is with the money spent......</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 1 month now. I have to say that I am quite surprised with the results I have experienced.  I feel a change in the texture and weight of my hair. It feels thicker in places where I felt thinness. The minimal citrus like scent the shampoo has is pleasing and it left my scalp feeling clean. I loved the fact that my dandruff seems to have stopped after i began using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would like to say that one should not expect overnight change, but if you wait a few days, i think you will like the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this! It smells lovely and is one of my favorite shampoos!!! My hair was noticeably stronger after only a few uses, very little breakage, And after two weeks I also noticed a drastic difference in how much hair I lost in the shower. I love this product and recommended it to my sister who has had difficulty growing her hair her entire life, her hair is thicker and stronger and has grown a half an inch! I have medium length hair and about two pumps is enough to lather my hair throughly so the shampoo lasts longer than most of the of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I am in my early forties, and and a healthy, professional appearance is essential in my career. I have long, thick, curly hair, but have been experiencing generalized hair thinning, and thinning at my hairline, for three years.  I have tried other products, with little results. I was understandably skeptical, but decided to try this product, d/t its glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for three weeks, and I already appear to have less thinning and breakage. My hair appears shinier and softer. I can also see baby hairs beginning to grow in at my hairline, and at the crown of my head. My husband has even commented on the new hair growth. I cannot wait to see what my hair looks like a few weeks from now. This shampoo is a definite must have for anyone experiencing hair loss! Five Stars!</li>
    <li> Is not usual for a woman to start losing a lot of hair, but that was my case. I started using this product long time ago and now I can perfectly see the effects. My hair grows stronger and thicker. The hair loss has been reduced significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a bottle big enough to last quite a long time and it smells very good. You can combine it with your regular shampoo if you want too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is fair enough for such a good product. I fully recomend it!</li>
    <li> The packaging is visually appealing which is what I expect after paying so much. The shampoo is very thick and rich. It smells like a sweet medicine. It makes a rich lather without using very much so you can stretch the product a little longer if your using it every other day. So far my scalp feels clean and I am starting to see a difference and it hasn&#x27;t even been a full week. I would suggest using a good conditioner if your scalp isn&#x27;t used to the dryness.</li>
    <li> No impact and not worth the money! Most unverified reviews are either fake or received by giving away free products.. Save your money</li>
    <li> This, the conditioner and the thickener are amazing products.. Wish I learn about them years ago.. I used to use wen.. That stuff is good for making your hair healthy but in my opinion doesn&#x27;t help with hair thinning or hair loss.. I feel like after a week with this stuff I noticed less hair falling out at my desk at work.. Normally I see so much hair fall out throughout the day but since starting I can run my hands through my hair without seeing any fallen strands..  Would highly recommend! Worth the price.. Just wish it was a bigger bottle..</li>
    <li> When I use this product, my hair does feel nice afterwards. But it is no thicker, I have no new hair growth, and my hair loss is exactly the same. Sham company.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a really nice smell and feels invigorating on the scalp. I really like it.</li>
    <li> Have to say I was surprised at how well the product works.  I noticed less shedding immediately after first three shampoos.  This product delivers, am glad I took the chance on $50.</li>
    <li> Upside: It leaves my hair feeling and smelling clean. Downside: Doesn&#x27;t lather as much as I would like it to.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from thinning hair most of my life. As a young woman this has been a humiliating part of my life. I have hid under wigs, hats, and been committed to wearing my hair pulled back. I had tried vinegar treatments to help clean my follicles, but it never helped with the regrowth of hair. This product has made a dramatic change in the biology of my scalp, and helps promote more growth. I used the shampoo each time I shower, and then use a light conditioner and wide tooth comb. Now I have confidence to wear my hair down!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time and the results so far are impressive.  My hair is definitely fuller and I&#x27;m beginning to see new growth in the thinner areas.  I love the way it smells and how my hair feels.  My husband even noticed the change in the texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Skeptical is about to order a bottle for himself!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I actually didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it did. I have very dry, brittle hair from dyeing it so much, so I&#x27;m always looking for products that can help me. My hair is now, soft, thick, shiny, and manageable after using this product.</li>
    <li> I am on my fourth bottles of this. I shampoo my hair 7-9 times a week and  have been using this for at least six months so I decided to review it.  My hair line had receded approximately an inch.  On this I began having hair grow below my previous hairline in weeks.  At this point my hairline has come back down between 1/4&amp;#34; and 3/8&amp;#34;  so it is a noticeable difference and I am happy with it.  It has however not done anything to thicken my hair and it has continued to thin while on this product.  It also seems to have made my hair more &amp;#34;wirey&amp;#34; tending to stick straight up which is, well, unfortunate. Before this I had tried liprogaine which caused some hair loss, chi ionic which seems to stabilize hair loss but not add anything, phytowortx which was absolutely terrible, and nioxin which caused hair loss.  My dad who began losing hair recently due to environmental reasons regained all his hair using Pura d&#x27;or so I am purchasing a bottle of that and will begin rotating the two.</li>
    <li> At first I was a little skeptical about using this product, but I have grown to love it. The hair surge shampoo did exactly what it was supposed to do. It really worked on the shedding and I am not nearly shedding as much hair as I was before the product. I initially never washed my hair quite as much though. Overall the product is GREAT, I recommend it for anyone who is trying to grow their hair or is experiencing hair thinning. This shampoo made my hair even feel thicker and stronger. MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has truly worked wonders! After a few weeks of use, I can see a definite difference in my hair. My hair is growing in thicker and fuller, especially along my hairline where it had been thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also given me a huge boost in shine--my hair looks healthier than ever before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the slight tingle, which makes me feel like it&#x27;s really working. The proof is in the pudding though, it really does help with hair growth!</li>
    <li> I was definitely a skeptic before I started using this product, but can vouch that it is a great product. Every since my pregnancy I have had hair loss that has not gotten any better and nothing seems to help. I tried switched to a couple different shampoos, vitamins, and eating certain foods that is suppose to promote hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has been a solution. I am not shedding as much and I have baby hairs growing in the front of my hair line!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot wait to see results a few months down the line!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair dry out and shrink like as if I had pour alcohol in my scalp awful Amazon please read the fakes review reports about this product I can no believe anybody can benefit of this horrible product as well as the hair lush serun from the same vendor , this one actually burned my scalp and gave allergy imediately after I used I had to wash my hair out of the product many times . This is a Scam do Not Buy it!!!! 0 star</li>
    <li> I used this product for a week. My hair dropped like crazy. I seriously doubt the quality of this product. There is little scientific ground for using caffeine to reduce hair loss (there is no in vivo study, nor human studies).  I had to stop using this product. By the way, this product is super expansive. I doubt those five star reviews are real users or just folk being hired.</li>
    <li> When approaching fifty there are certain things you just expect but thinning hair wasn&#x27;t one of them. I&#x27;ve always had thin hair but now I can see my scalp in certain places. When I bought this product I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much and was pleasantly surprised that after just one week I was noticing less hair in my hairbrush and my hair felt different. I also noticed that I&#x27;m not finding a lot of hair coming out during the day when I touch it up in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is very thick and has great coverage. There is a pleasant tingling sensation all through your scalp that feels really good. I highly recommended this product to any women that are starting to notice more hair in their hairbrush these days.</li>
    <li> Immediate results after use. Easy to open and use.  Hair feels fuller. Immediate results.</li>
    <li> I was definitely skeptical going into this purchase, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;m definitely glad that I did! After a fairly short time, I&#x27;ve really started to notice an effect. My hair looks great, feels great, and, best of all, there&#x27;s more of it. When it&#x27;s as easy as using a shampoo like you normally would, why not go ahead and keep your hair?</li>
    <li> It has only been a little over a week of using this product, but I can already see that my hair feels much fuller and thicker than it was. I started losing hair about 2 years ago after chemical damage from highlights and have been trying many products to try to re-gain the volume. In the week that I have used this shampoo, I really see a difference in the amount of hair that falls out after a shower and after brushing my hair. Pairing this shampoo with a good conditioner has really brought back some of the moisture, shine, and volume that I had lost. These are the results after only a week of using this shampoo, so I&#x27;m very excited to see the progress after a month!</li>
    <li> In recent years my hair has been getting really thin. I found this product and read all the reviews and figured I would give it a try. Well, the results have been really impressive and I am so happy with the results and the product. Would certainly purchase this again. This WILL become a staple in my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with hair loss for the last several years and this has been a great product to use that has worked better than the products I have purchased from CVS. I would strongly recommend it to anyone wanting to try a new product for hair loss after trying others.</li>
    <li> I suffer from a thyroid illness and unfortunately the side effects have resulted in hair loss and hair thinning. I have been using the Ultrax Hair Surge for three weeks. I can already see my hair thickness and fullness coming back! I am looking forward to the future results as I am positive it will bring my hair quality back to life.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is pleasant and leaves no residue on my scalp and i have a sensitive scalp. My recommendation is to Try it out now!!!</li>
    <li> Maybe this works for more severe cases but if you&#x27;re just barely starting to see your hairline receding this probably won&#x27;t have much of a difference</li>
    <li> I don’t have issues with hair loss but I’ve always had very thin hair. I was just born that way, and certain styles, even ponytails, would leave spots that showed more scalp than I wanted. Styling and volumizing shampoos and sprays only did so much, so I thought I would try a product that promised actual hair growth. I’ve noticed other reviewers saying they didn’t like the scent but I wasn’t bothered by it. There are hints of mint and citrus in there. I’ve been using the product for about a month and have noticed an overall improvement in the strength and thickness of my hair, including a small amount of new growth at the scalp line. When I shower or brush my hair there’s a LOT less breakage than before, I find less loose hairs that used to shed on my clothes or after running my hands through it. Overall I’m definitely satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days now and already I see less hair in the drain catcher after I wash my hair.  Also, you don&#x27;t have to buy a special conditioner to use after this shampoo,  you can just use your favorite brand.</li>
    <li> I am  enjoying trying out this product! Not only do I love the fact that it arrived on time, but I love the smell and how great it leaves your hair clean and feeling thick!! Definitely planning on purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for hair growth.  You can feel it working it&#x27;s very powerful and we have to be careful when rinsing not to allow the product to go into to the face  because it burns.  This is no cheap stuff this is the real deal for hair growth!  I have been using this product just for five days along with the  conditioner and my hair is growing wild!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this shampoo a 1 star simply the fact for not improving hair growth on my scalp and not strengthening my hair follicles like it said it should, I believed this shampoo was supposed to have a DHT blocker to prevent Hair Loss , but it Failed. My hair is still Falling as regular ( this shampoo makes my hair shed even more when I shower) it does contain an ingredient  called ketoconazole  which helps regrow hair BUT the percent it too low it only contains&lt;br /&gt;0.2 % My hair specialist Doctor prescribed me Propecia it is supposed to help stop hair shedding and regrow hair. I&#x27;m a Male and only 23 years old by the way.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my hair. Bottle was tiny, smaller than expected. Only pros were that it did not dry out my hair anymore than normal and the lemon lime scent wasn&#x27;t too bad. Did not feel any tingle as others had mentioned, and did not see any growth whatsoever, next time I will probably save my money and buy a tea tree shampoo and add caffeine to that to see if there is any benefit as that actually feels like it tingles.</li>
    <li> Amazingly fast shipping, I would give them an A+ in speediness, I absolutely love getting my items quickly!!  As for the product: I just started using the shampoo a few days ago but already my hair feels softer and fuller.  Considering that my hair is curly, it is difficult to detangle in the shower and this shampoo did that trick with ease.  More importantly, I have noticed a decrease in shedding while shampooing in the shower.  I have dandruff, and I think this shampoo has reduced build-up of flakes in my hair.  Dandruff is definitely a contributing factor to how much my hair sheds, so I expect that just this in and of itself will contribute greatly to reducing my hair loss.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the effects in a month or so as this product really gets a chance to do its work.  Also, I like the pleasant smell and the shine it is leaving in my hair...</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my confidence. I have tried similar products without much success, so I had my doubts using this. Unlike similar products I have used, this one did not leave a filmy sensation after using it. It feels very lite on my hair and does not feel damaging like a harsh chemical! After several uses I&#x27;m noticing that patches where my hair is very thin are already starting to feel fuller. At this price the product is a great deal. Salons where I live offer these products for much higher prices. Now I don&#x27;t feel like the “old guy” at the weekly staff meetings.</li>
    <li> Recently I had experienced hair loss and a friend of mine referred me to this product and Im pleased with my results...Great Product</li>
    <li> - Very Fast Shipping , Great Shampoo. No more Shedding For Me !</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. My girlfriend&#x27;s hair has been falling out rapidly due to a conditiom she has, and after a few days of using this product it helped tremendously!! After a few days we are seeing little to no hair fall out &amp; it looks very full and healthy!! No thim, shedding or unhealthy looking areas! This is worth every penny if you are someone who is experiencing hair loss &amp; you want to keep your hair. Such a great buy, many thumbs up</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results of this shampoo.  It&#x27;s not a miracle or anything, but I do believe it has halted or dramatically slowed my hair loss.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but fortunately I don&#x27;t need much at a time.  One bottle lasts me several months.  I give it 4 stars for the value, but am otherwise pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Hair feels great and this stuff smells awesome.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and falls out a lot when being washed and brushed. When using this shampoo you can tell that it is going to make a difference. After a short time of using it, I can tell a difference and there&#x27;s definitely less breakage and lose of hair. I imagine after using this long term the results will be extremely noticeable. I will continue to reorder this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was a little sketchy about buying this product, especially for how much it cost but so far it has been proving itself. Small hairs are starting to grow and I just started using it about two weeks ago! Shampoo smells great as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 and don&#x27;t have much volume in my hair since I have thin hair. I always had to manipulate my hair to look more voluminous when drying or would tease my hair like crazy. Plus when I was little, I had my hair stuck in a round brush and freaked out so I ended up pulling a front area of my hair out. It never grew back minus a few baby hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a skeptic when first buying this product since I&#x27;ve tried other alternatives that never worked quite as well. I&#x27;ve been seeing a significant amount of hair growth after using Ultrax (for almost 2 months now). My family has complimented me on it and my mom and aunt have now bought the product as well. I shampoo with Ultrax every 2-3 days and rinse with apple cider vinegar to ensure lasting shine. Really pleased with the decrease in shedding as well! There&#x27;s less hair stuck in my brush and dryer, on my floors, pillow, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s helped make my hair not look as flat, added about an inch within 2 months. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone, even those without hair loss problems! It really does work wonders. At least for me it did. :)</li>
    <li> Left my scalp dry and did not notice much of a difference.  Save your money</li>
    <li> Your hair deserves the best. Those cheap shampoos you can get at your local retailer just don&#x27;t work for me. This special formula they have in Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo leaves my hair clean, smelling fantastic and looking healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> I honestly can say that my expectations weren’t that high when purchasing this hair growth shampoo especially for the price.  Receding hair lines are commonplace with the men in my family so I was looking for something to alleviate this irritating problem.  I’ve been using this shampoo for close to 4 weeks now and I’m seeing an improvement in my hair volume, texture and most importantly the length.  Now the next test will be permanently stopping and slowing the thinning process because as a male, I’m reluctant to let my hair go completely bald.  Yes, the price can be costly but as you can see, it has help my hair tremendously.</li>
    <li> The suggested procedure to put the shampoo on, then leave it on 2 - 3 minutes before rinsing was different,  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change, I haven&#x27;t used it all &amp; probably won&#x27;t.  It was too expensive, I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this shampoo, I found out about it from a blog.  I&#x27;m in my early twenties and pregnant, one side of my head is thin I guess from all the years of colouring, perming and cutting my hair.  I just got this shampoo yesterday and I used it for the first time, the smell is pleasant not strong like my usual garnier shampoo anyway I used it and it made my hair very soft and surprisingly there no strands of hair coming out when I ran my fingers through my head.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this shampoo, it looks like I found the answers to my prayers!</li>
    <li> My hair has STOPPED falling out!!!! And is has become thicker!!!</li>
    <li> After following instructions and using this product at length, I can say that it is an above average product. The shampoo itself is thick and requires a great deal in order to get a creamy lather, but the scent is neutral for both female and male. As far as the ingredients are concerned, it is rare to have this combination of anti-fungal and Saw Palmetto which benefits the user. I noticed small hair regrowth around my part and it has continued to create, overall, thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference after using this shampoo for a little over a week.  My hair is clean and shiny and my scalp feels great!</li>
    <li> A must buy! I love that this product does exactly what it says. I could already begin to see results after a few uses. Within a few months, my hairs has grown back fairly fast. This product has made my hair fuller and thicker more than ever!!</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo and I have been using it everyday. I shed a lot of hair on the daily and especially in the shower but I have noticed a dramatic change since I started using this product. My hair also doesn&#x27;t get that greasy anymore so I think I will cut down to washing my hair once every 2 or even 3 days which will improve the health of my hair and it is all thanks to this amazing shampoo. It also smells great and makes your hair smooth so when I get out of the shower, it is very easy to brush. This causes less breakage and hair loss as well. I would definitely recommend this product to people suffering of hair loss or hair thinning.</li>
    <li> Several months ago a friend gave me a bottle of UltraLabs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair loss Growth Stimulation  Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;When I had complained about hair loss and mainly thinning in several areas on my head.  I used the shampoo  as directed and after about  4-6 weeks I actually saw a difference. Didn&#x27;t think it would work but it did!  It also softened the texture  but the hair seems stronger and more dense.  Just ordered a new bottle!&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey but it&#x27;s wort it and I&#x27;m worth it!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing it provides a smooth texture to your hair. The smell is very delightful. The advantages this shampoo provides to your hair are amazing it reconstructs damage hair and aids in promoting growth. I have recommended this product to all my friends and family. looking forward on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! I have not had it for very long, but I already see a big difference in my hair! I often color, blow-dry and iron my hair so it is not very healthy. However, this shampoo instantly repairs it. It feels softer, shinier, thicker and fuller! I am thrilled with how well it works! It also smells refreshing, not one of those obnoxious, over the top perfume smells. I am so happy with the experience of this shampoo, I will invest in more products from hair surge!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! :-) :-)&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thicker and fuller amazing product&lt;br /&gt;My hair used to shed like crazy and this product slowed it down I dont shed!!!! :-) :-)</li>
    <li> Right out of the box I knew I had a winner.  The aroma that flowed from the pump when I first squeezed it let me know that I had a winner.  I can&#x27;t wait to tell my friends what I&#x27;ve discovered using this product.  When I applied it to my scalp it felt rich, thick, luxurious, and the smell!  Nothing speaks of quality quite like a hair product that will stimulate your scalp and smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description in my opinion is right on, as being the most powerful shampoo formula available to promote thicker and fuller hair.  The combination of ingredients speak to the power of the formula.  Not to mention your scalp truly does feel stimulated even after the very first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to create a richer, thicker, fuller head of hair that smells good, I suggest you start here.</li>
    <li> Used two bottles to give it enough &#x27;time.&#x27;  It always made my hair feel great, increased volume, and easier to style, but thats not why I bought it (twice..).  Hair loss remained at as high a pace as ever, and I used it daily for I dunno, 5 months.  Didnt change a thing.  Useless experiment after all... thanks for nothing.</li>
    <li> It is very nice shampoo. It works very fast .I recommend  this product to use every body.</li>
    <li> The product smells great and doesn&#x27;t have an odor that&#x27;s too strong. I love the packaging, it provides a lot of helpful information about the product with clear instructions. This shampoo feels great in my hair and has reduced the amount of shedding and breakage I have. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to my friends who struggle with hair loss/growth or shedding!</li>
    <li> Cool, I bought the Ultrax Labs shampoo after having issues with other brands and not getting any results with all other brands. The issue with these hair regenerative products is trying to find a good product that is viable in terms of being a voluminizing shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this most days and enjoy it very much. I only shampoo every 2 to 3 days so I&#x27;m not following their directions of 5 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the results are that  my hair FINALLY has more volume and shine and it even grows faster. My issue was thin hair and this helps me. In reality, this is the best my hair has ever felt and looked. It seems to shine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my shedding issue seem to get better with this product. I think it helps with trying to sustain and keep hair healthy and strong. I would neem oil for optimal results.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge will work! But please do not expect results over night.. Ultrax labs Surge contains Caffeine. Caffeine has the ability to work with your hair follicles, helping to improve your hair follicle’s behavior and normalizing your hair growth by helping to restore it or further prevent hair loss. The product also contains Ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is a great medication to use to help treat a dry itchy scalp. I went into using this product knowing I would probably see no results..within 3 weeks I noticed I was not pulling out handfuls of hair!..This stuff drastically reduced my hair loss and made my hair smell delicious. PLEASE NOTE: This will not eliminate hair loss! I have tried various types of shampoos and conditioners without seeing any results... that&#x27;s why after 3 weeks with ultrax labs hair surge I was blown away. I highly recommend this product to anyone experiencing  androgenic alopecia and male patternbaldness (MPB) Just be patient....</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this stuff! At first I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried others before, but gave it a try base on all the good reviews. I&#x27;m glad I did! I&#x27;m a mother of 3 kids all 5yo and under and need less to say, sleep deprivation for the past 5 years can really effect your hair. I&#x27;ve been losing more hair lately. I can see it on my pillow, brush, and shower drain, even when I sweep the floor, my hair accumulates in the dust pan too. It has been a month since I started using this and I have been seeing a difference in my hair. Less hair on the pillows, brush, and shower drain, my hair is growing faster because I can tell from my bangs growing into my eyes, AND my hair feels healthy and bouncy!!! You have to follow the instruction exactly like it said to do. I read some reviews that said they even used it everyday and that&#x27;s good too, I think as long as it&#x27;s at least the recommended amount to get the good results. My hair is already thick so I wasn&#x27;t concern about that, I was worry about all the hair loss at my age (mid 30s), but this product totally helped with that.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to evaluate hair growth, but this shampoo makes my hair and scalp feel great. And you don&#x27;t have to wait weeks for results either; immediately I can tell my hair feels smoother and thicker.  It has a very clean subtle scent, no flowery or chemical heavy fragrance.</li>
    <li> What I noticed the first time after using was that my hair was more manageable, softer a bit shinier and not as frizzy. This was after the first use! Less tangles to comb through when it was wet, and less shedding after two days of use. I used 3 pumps of shampoo each time, and only on my scalp, leaving it on for four minutes before rinsing out. I did not use this on the ends of my hair at all.  The smell is pleasant and you may feel a very slight tingling sensation while the shampoo is on you scalp. Washing it off felt like it cleared away some of the build up that had been bothering me for about a week before. I like the bottle is a pump and you turn the nozzle one way to open and the opposite way to close. This is a great way to prevent leaking. It is only an 8oz bottle and a bit pricey so you don&#x27;t want to loose any shampoo to poor packaging. The shampoo also contains the following • Caffeine - which allegedly will help extend the life cycle of hair follicles and encourage healthy hair. • Ketoconazole - Is a powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal ingredient and is commonly found in prescription strength dandruff shampoo. This definitely has some immediate benefit. Looking forward to healthier hair the longer I use it!  ***Update*** After several uses my hair is shinier and much softer. Definitely less shedding. It takes awhile to get the hang of not using to much as it doesn&#x27;t lather up like traditional shampoos, but the end results are worth the extra effort. If you have long hair just section it off to make applying to the scalp easier.</li>
    <li> The Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo is fantastic. Unlike many hair growth shampoos, this shampoo actually works. The shampoo has a great herbal scent and creates a beautiful shine. Being that i had post-partum hair loss, my hair was becoming extremely thin. After using the  Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo for a month, i have significantly less hair loss. My hair look a lot thicker and voluminous. Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I liked the smell of the shampoo and how well it lathered up in my hair.  I was also delighted that my hair did not need anything to detangle it after washing my hair.  I have only used this once, but I noticed that I had less hair in the drain catcher.  My hair was also fuller after it dried.  Before using this my hair was laying flat to my head, but now it is fuller looking.  I can hardly wait to see how much more my hair will improve with continued use.</li>
    <li> I am known for saying that no amount of caffeine is too much - who knew that would apply to my hair as well. I&#x27;ve been surprised at how much less hair is in the drain catch since introducing this black beauty to the product shelf in my shower. It&#x27;s like getting a jump start on breakfast while getting ready!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a particularly advanced situation when it comes to thinning hair / hair falling out - so it&#x27;s really a proactive move on my part, but where I have seen a difference is in my eyebrows. I hadn&#x27;t realized how often shampoo gets on them and looks like I&#x27;ll be shortening the time between visits to my aesthetician, and working harder to keep it off of them so I don&#x27;t start looking positively Cro-Magnon.</li>
    <li> I just started using the shampoo and, although I can&#x27;t say if it effectively works as a hair growth stimulator, I can definitely say that already my hair feels softer and fuller. I bought the product because it has such great reviews, and was attracted to it by its active ingredients. My hair is not very thick and I have had problems with thinning and falling hair lately, reason why I am trying it. I was surprised looking in the mirror noticing my hair having more volume, and I really like the clean and refreshing feeling the shampoo leaves on my hair. One point of advice, make sure you follow instructions, message the scalp and after lathering leave the shampoo on your hair for at least 2 minutes before rinsing. I have tried both rinsing immediately and letting it stay a while as recommended and I noticed my hair was looking fuller and feeling thicker when I left it on.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is in an 8-ounce bottle and it is dispensed through a pump on top. The bottle seems to last for a while, despite its small size. I have found you don’t need a lot of this shampoo for it to he hair and work and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t produce much foam does not prevent the hair from feeling clean after it is rinsed. The shampoo contains caffeine, and there’s a slight pleasant odor when you massage it in, and It doesn’t smell medicated, like other hair similar products do.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, I had my girlfriend try it, and she also noticed how her hair, definitely longer and fuller than mine, felt softer and had more volume.</li>
    <li> I have been using for several days now and already the shedding of hair has stopped and the strength of the hair is slowly getting strong again. I can see new hair growing in already too but minimal in this early stage.Don&#x27;&#x27;t expect miracles overnight but definitely a homerun product to aid in growing and strengthening the hair left. I recommended this product to a few of my friends and they are now going to be using it too! Thanks Ultra Labs!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome,way betture than Rogain. I&#x27;m 31 now and starting to see a little fading on the roof, this stuff is defiantly going to help me keep a full head of hair. Thanks...</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product that would deliver results it promised and I have finally found it!I have suffered from excessive hair loss and dry scalp for many years.I have tried so many shampoos,treatments, and even natural remedies and nothing was working.I came across this product and decided to give it a try and see if it would make any difference in my hair.My first impression was that the shampoo lathers very well and a little goes a long way,I also really liked that is smells very clean, no harsh chemical or strong fragrance.I noticed that afterwards my scalp also felt very clean it helped reduce buildup that other products leave behind.I am seeing much improvement in the strength of my hair, my hair feels healthier and looks great, also I have seen a huge decrease in my hair loss and I see new hair growing in. I have been getting so many compliments on my hair and I have this product to thank.</li>
    <li> I am a college aged student. I realized last year as a sophomore that myhair began to fall out consistently. It was the strangest thing. It might have been stress factors. I for months looked for hair loss and hair growth stimulation. I came across this product and let me tell you it works! My hair is so thick and beautiful. I no longer feel self-conscious about how thin my hair was. I am in a sorority and I hated to explain what was going on with my hair. It was so thin and now its so beautiful, thick and voluminous. HIGHLY RECOMENDED SHAMPOO. Ultrax Labs has saved me and my hair. This caffeine hair loss shampoo truly works wonders. My hair does not fall out as much as it used to. My hair is so beautiful now. Never changing shampoos! A+++ Amazon!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs clearly put a ton of thought and research into creating this restorative shampoo. Its unique combination of caffeine, ketoconazole and saw palmetto works together to not only thicken my thinning hair, but to make it feel healthier in general. The quality and texture of my hair has noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is somewhat higher than other similar (but ineffective) products, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a hair thickening product that actually WORKS. Since using this shampoo just for the last few weeks, my hairline has been revitalized, the rest of my hair has noticeably thickened, and shedding has become almost nonexistent. I&#x27;ve been following the suggested 5x a week regimen and I can only assume that this is the path to the fastest positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond its efficacy in restoring hair, this is a great shampoo otherwise. It smells great, lathers really well, and it just feels revitalizing and re-energizing on the scalp. A+ product, well worth the money. Also, kudos to Beauty Superstore Plus for incredibly fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This item was one of those that you are skeptical to buy but after purchasing it I was very happy . It feels great and your scalp feels clean,&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice and the product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;So Happy</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high hopes but low expectations.  First off, the item arrived on time and as described.  I&#x27;ll cut to the chase.  This product really works.  I have been using it for two weeks now and I am already noticing a significant improvement.  My bald patch at the top of my head appears to be filling in and is noticeably smaller than it was before I started using this shampoo.  Also, my hair feels thicker and has more volume.  I have been using the Hair Solace conditioner(also by Ultrax), along with this shampoo and the two products together are making a tremendous improvement.  It has only been two weeks, so I am excited to see continued improvement as I continue using this product.  I was skeptical at first, but now I believe.  This stuff works.  I recommend the conditioner as well.  I have not had time to write a review on that yet, but I will give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> 28 years old, suffering from a very predictable onset of pattern baldness. Thanks dad! Anyhow, the product does what it claims. Though I fear I found it too late. While the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back into my loss spots, the hair that I have remaining seems to be fuller and stronger than ever before. Only time will tell, but I&#x27;m hopeful that this also means the balding won&#x27;t continue, and I can salvage my social life with a combover.</li>
    <li> stopped hair from falling off more than usual but it only seems to work for a little bit after showering. didnt really seem to work for me</li>
    <li> 30 yr old male, lived with proceeding male pattern baldness since about 22 or 23 years of age. Figured I&#x27;d rather live the last 20 yrs of my life with no hair than the first 20 with hair. Have dutifully applied this almost every morning since mid August 2014 to now mid-December 2014, so 4 months total. Apparently my genetics are stronger than this formula. I applied the shampoo, scrubbed and massaged it for about 30 seconds and then sit and wait with my head lowered so it wouldn&#x27;t run off, counting out 2 long minutes then rinsed. I have exercised consistently, discovered I had hypothyroidism which I have been treating 2 months now, eaten better foods, tried sleeping better, with no results. I have grown the sides out more and leftover hair on top to provide a comfortable comb over but no results in 4 months. I&#x27;ll finish off my bottle of what&#x27;s left and try Rogaine or something. Oh, no tingling effect with this shampoo either. Maybe your genetics are better suited to this product than mine, but my genetics or thyroid issues...whatever it is, it is too powerful for this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for quite a few time now and I can say my hair is getting stronger, I can see it. Months ago my hair was falling down at a higher rate that ever before, but now I can barely see hair when I clean the shower and it looks more vigorous and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is big enough to last long time in your shower and the smell is nice and remains in your hair almost all the day. I am very happy with the product and will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> Menopause causes hair loss for women and it&#x27;s so embarrassing. Thank goodness for a product like this really works, my hair has new regrowth!</li>
    <li> This does not work and is very drying to the hair. Definitely not worth the money. I bought this because I thought it would help with my oily/itchy scalp since it has ketoconazole (antifungal) in it. However, this product did not help but rather very drying to my hair, which made my scalp even more oiler. When your hair get oily, they stick together; thus, making the appearance of thinner and weaker hair. I have found a new solution to my oily hair and scalp. I have been using the Aussie Volume shampoo and condition and these two products really help. Then I blow dry my hair with the babyliss proTT hair dryer. Remember to apply heat protection prior to blow dry. My hair has been healthiest since I started this regimen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for several weeks now and can see a real difference in the overall health of my hair. I have much less, to hardly any, hair loss since using this product.  I actually love that it only takes a small amount to get a nice shampoo and that it does not create a lot of &#x27;suds&amp;#34; while shampooing.  Who needs all the suds when you get amazing results!  My hair feels so much softer, thicker and cleaner with Ultrax  compared to ANY shampoo/conditioners I have ever used, and I have always used  top of the line salon products.  I will continue to use this shampoo for as long as it is on the market!</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much. Many people may not like that,  but that just proofs this is no ordinary shampoo. It also,  smells good.</li>
    <li> I am 22 year old female. Out of no where i started experiencing severe hair loss (most likely stress related) and i turn to Ultrax after reading ALL the positive reviews. Well let me tell you that it DOES NOT WORK. In fact ever since Ive started using this product I&#x27;ve noticed that my scalp is itchy and I have been developing bumps (pimple like) on and around my scalp. Whether its an allergic reaction or not. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> Worthless. Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Do not buy. Avoid, etc.</li>
    <li> I was amazed how clean this product got my hair, it took out all the residue left from my salon shampoos and conditioners. My hair was shiny and looking great. The real test was checking my drain screen and I found no hair in it which means I didn&#x27;t shed any.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective shampoo. I struggled with my hair falling out frequently and appearing very thin. This doesn&#x27;t magically work overnight or anything, but definitely after a few weeks of using it, I can tell the difference; there is regrowth beginning and I am losing less hair. My scalp feels cleaner too. An added bonus- it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This stimulated my hair growth FAST!</li>
    <li> This is a great and effective product to use. Ordering was seamless and shipping was extremely prompt. I will definitely order again!.</li>
    <li> I normally have hair that looks stuck to my head and super flat but not when I use this shampoo. My hair looks so thick and full body.</li>
    <li> LOVE this Shampoo!! It really makes my hair feel so much thicker and fuller, and I know the best results will come in time. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong or offensive, which is important in my book. It&#x27;s a gel like consistency, so it&#x27;s &amp;#34;lather&amp;#34; might not be the same type that you&#x27;re used to (ie: with lots of suds), therefore, I find that what I like best is to wet my hair, use this shampoo on the root/scalp area only, really massage it in for at least 1 minute, then I add my normal shampoo on top and really give it a good sudsy lather. That way not only do I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like it&#x27;s clean (since we all associate a good lather with clean hair), but it also retains the same smell I like, AND all the benefits from this amazing shampoo! I can&#x27;t wait to use the whole bottle and take an after picture!! Thicker, Longer, Stronger hair... that&#x27;s a WIN, WIN, WIN in my book!&lt;br /&gt;(will post before and after picrures, once the bottle is empty)&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly, highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews, I just had to try this &amp;#34;made in the USA&amp;#34; product. While many are looking for this product to re-grow hair from balding, I&#x27;m looking to lessen the shedding I experience. Trying it the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine shampoo first time, my hair and scalp felt great. It felt clean and refreshed. It lathered pretty well, without using very much of the product, and it rinsed easily. The smell is pleasant, even though it has a slight medicated scent. It&#x27;s a bit too early to mention anything in regards to the shampoo curbing my shedding, but I have noticed that my hair has more body and seems more manageable. In light of that, I am hopeful it will have an affect on my shedding as I continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Smell this product smells like mist oranges, light smell with it, though most say like medical shampoo think smell, like coming from doctors product. Using product, brings good amount shampoo, after using leaves like lather thick lightly feeling hair. Product believe work, think gives hair extra boost every time using it, giving nice comb out once hair dried using it. Try it be sure pleased afterwards.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this product tremendously.  It smells great for a man or a woman and rinsed very quickly.  The container is nice and the pump works great.  After only one use, I have had the product thickening my hair and having it feel great.  I would strongly recommend this product to men and women who would like a better alternative to products like Nioxin.  It left my hair soft and manageable with an increased volume from root to scalp.  I liked how my hair was even the next day and after a few days of using it, I will order this again to use.  The clear, non-offensive smell is great and the way it leaves your hair is what will get most to buy it again.  Only a small amount of the product is needed to be used and that will save money in the long run.</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive at first but this shampoo really really works. I have been shampooing with it for the past few weeks, a few times a week. My thinning hair already looks and feels thicker! My receding hairline seems to be holding firm now and is already looking fuller. The Shampoo also leaves no chemical smell in your hair like other hair loss shampoos do. The shampoo lathers really nicely and has a great feel as you massage it into your scalp. Overall I am very satisfied with the results and will continue to use this shampoo to fight my hair loss.</li>
    <li> My Ex-GF and I still exchange gifts on each others&#x27; birthdays, and realizing that she was experiencing premature female pattern hair loss (don&#x27;t know the medical term for it, but it really eats at her self-esteem!) I bought her a bottle. Yes, it is costly but I have heard quite positive feedback from her comparing the cost to that of treatments she&#x27;s used unsuccessfully in the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo resembles more banana than caffeine (I think of the color brown.) and has a sweet scent. It is extremely thick, and for her hair it is perfect if it creates a thick lather. My ex uses it nearly daily and though it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, she told me this morning that the &amp;#34;part&amp;#34; in her hair where the hair was not as thick appears smaller. I assume she&#x27;s satisfied, and expect for HER to order more of this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuff like this is very difficult to give as a gift, but if the recipient can get over the initial shock of hair loss, it is well worth giving him or her a bottle.</li>
    <li> Right away I felt a difference in the texture of my hair. It felt thicker, more coarse and had a nice little tingle feel which told me it was actually doing something. I don&#x27;t feel as much hair on my face now when I dry my hair, then dry my face, so it seems to also help hold on to what you currently have. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty smell either, like I&#x27;ve found with Rogaine when I used to use it. And since it&#x27;s a shampoo, again, unlike Rogaine, you don&#x27;t have to put it in twice a day, have it run down the back of your neck, get on your clothing, and then smell like Rogaine the rest of the day, or soak it into your pillow at night. This is sooooo much simpler and more cost effective. So glad that I found this product.</li>
    <li> it really works! I am pretty picky about what I put in my hair. however, there was something was that told me I had to buy this product and I&#x27;m very happy I did. leaves my hair soft, growing, and feeling healthy. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I feel like I need to put in on this because all the positive reviews are a little fishy. Two weeks into using this product i had to clean my own hair out of my drain for the first time in many months. I had to clean it out once a week after that until I gave up on this stuff and went back to my old shampoo. It also doesn&#x27;t lather or clean your hair very well. This product is way too expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap: it actually works. This is my second bottle and my hair has never looked better. Since I began using it, my hair almost immediately felt and looked fuller and thicker, and it even developed that lustrous sheen and glow that only super healthy hair has. It&#x27;s easier to style now too, and softer, and I actually enjoy running my fingers through it (or letting someone else do it). Now I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve actually grown new hair, or if it just stopped me from losing more and made what I did have thicker and stronger, but either way my thinning crisis has been averted and I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about my head. My hats have been getting far less use lately, that&#x27;s for sure. Added bonus: the tingling sensation feels great while you&#x27;re showering (probably the caffeine or ketaconazole) and the smell is pleasant and aromatic as well. It seems as long as I&#x27;m using this stuff I&#x27;m not in any danger of my balding/thinning progressing, thank the frickin heavens. I just wasn&#x27;t ready for that...</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair along my front hairline.  I have tried many &amp;#34;stimulating&amp;#34; shampoos that didn&#x27;t work.  I was skeptical about trying yet another product but I am glad I did. I no longer see hair falling into the sink when I comb it.  I love the tingling sensation. I gave the product 5 stars because it is easy to use, effective and smells good.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. For the price ...in time expect to see ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Less shedding.&lt;br /&gt;- Nicer , fuller, healthier looking hair .. (Even thicker at times)&lt;br /&gt;- Feels like the scalp is clean and not heavy build up. So it can work as a clarifying shampoo as well.&lt;br /&gt;- not heavily perfumed or scented - which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product to others who are having trouble with thin, shedding hair who want a fuller more healthier look.</li>
    <li> I bought this 4 months ago and did not give it time to work. I have now used it for about 5 months and it has not regrown hair, but it has made my hair fuller and stopped or slowed the thinning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use Rogaine with this and my receding hair line has regrown hair completely in my frontal hairline. I have seen regrowth with this combination that I decided to try,(I said what do I have to lose) and the results have been new hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t give up just try different combinations of products and if you don&#x27;t have male-pattern baldness you will see results. I&#x27;m 49 and started to recede a little in the front and crown, now almost all grown in.</li>
    <li> product makes you lose hair. after switching i shed less. be careful read the one star comments. wish i did before buying but now i know better and do this for every product i shop for</li>
    <li> OMG this shampoo is incredible.  My hair feels so healthy and like silk.  Over time it is supposed to get thicker too. I&#x27;m definitely going to recommend this, especially to a friend whose hair is beginning to grow back after chemo treatments.  Her hair growth is not consistent and I think shampoo will be a great benefit to her.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so quickly but I&#x27;m already seeing improvements and I&#x27;m very impressed. I highly recommend buying this product as I was very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this almost a month ago and I&#x27;m so disappointed to say it never worked for me.  I was so hopeful after reading the reviews and how much I spent on the product itself.  I saw no regrowth nor did it grow faster.  I even was taking biotin during the time and nothing has helped.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic! First, the product was packed correct and did not spill.  The aroma is great, a nice neutral smell that I believe almost anyone would like. This includes males and females.  Feels great on the scalp. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Meh. I used this daily as recommended for over a month. Compared to Nioxin, I think I actually saw my hair thin out more. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Def. a great hair growth shampoo. Tried it for a week so far and my hair has more body to it and sheds less.</li>
    <li> This shampoo instantly made my hair feel fuller and it made it soft without having to add conditioner.  Even better, after a month I started getting hair growth in a place I thought would never grow again due to age/over processing.  Will definitely continue to use.  What would make this product even better would be adding a flowery scent like gardenia.</li>
    <li> I purchased the ultrax labs hair surge caffeine shampoo, conditioner and hair lush... in short, I didn&#x27;t see any results.  I&#x27;m not sure how they have so many positive reviews but save your money.</li>
    <li> This really does work. I can see the difference in my hair with shedding being reduced in a matter of weeks. Dealing with shedding is so problematic, but this product is the best solution. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually skeptical about products that promise too much, but felt compelled to write a review about this item. I have been using this shampoo for about 20 days, and although I am not sure it really promotes hair growth, it has improved dramatically my hair&#x27;s overall appearance right on the first use. I have been asked if I changed hair color, if I got a new haircut, etc, because my hair looks that much healthier. The price is steep but I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I just received this and have only used it twice so I cannot comment on hair regrowth yet.  I can say that it has made my hair seem fuller and healthier.  Smells great and has a nice lather as well.</li>
    <li> I’m giving this shampoo to my husband because his hair has really started to thin out.  Of course, I had to try it myself!  The shampoo has a nice, rich consistency and the orange fragrance is pleasant.  It didn’t lather as much as my usual shampoo, and I’m thinking that may be because there isn’t so much detergent in it, which I know is damaging to hair.  I was really surprised to find that my own color-processed hair feels softer than it has in I don’t know how many years!  Very nice!  I’m giving it four stars until my husband has a chance to use it for a month or so to see if his hair grows better.  The directions say you’re supposed to use it at least five times a week to see a difference.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find it useful afte using  2 bottles and suggest you not to use this..</li>
    <li> This is probably the best hair loss treatment out! I can already see the difference after one week. My hair feels thicker, and baby hairs have started growing again. The shampoo smells good and works! I use it as directed, five times per week. About three pumps works to stimulate my hair. The caffeine really stimulates the hair, while the Ketoconazole and Saw Palmetto really clean and rejuvenate the  follicles. I would recommend this product to people who are just starting to lose hair, and for those who have already seen hair loss.</li>
    <li> This stuff is out of this world! Buy it!</li>
    <li> I used this Shampoo and found it to be a quality product it has a pleasant scent some good ingredients and builds up a good lather when applied to my Hair so you don&#x27;t have to use a large amount when pouring it into your hand. The last thing i liked was that it rinsed out of my hair easily I have some friends with hair loss issues that i plan on recommending this Shampoo to.</li>
    <li> You can immediately feel a tingling sensation as you lather this shampoo in your hair. It lathers pretty good without having to use too much of the shampoo. Provides a very good, clean finish after rinsing out. It totally removed any dandruff that I had without having a scaly scalp afterwards. I recommend using a conditioner after because it cleans so well that it leaves your hair dry. After drying my hair, it was very soft and easy to manage. So far, so good! Looking forward to seeing the growth progress from using this product.</li>
    <li> After trying so many different kinds of thickening shampoos and conditioners over the years, with nothing making much of a difference, I heard about this company and their 100 percent guarantee so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I made sure to leave it on for several minutes each time and after a few days, I started to notice my hair feeling thicker and healthier. I&#x27;m glad I took the chance--now I can throw away all the half used products that are cluttering my bathroom!</li>
    <li> didnt notice much of a difference.</li>
    <li> Growing up, my hair was really thick - it&#x27;s still pretty thick, but my salonist said I&#x27;m going through a &amp;#34;shedding season&amp;#34; which translates to me losing lots of hair. This product works really well - I like two things in particular - peppermint oil, which is a natural aid at promoting hair growth and that this product has an antifungal in its ingredients. The main thing is I notice my hair is a bit thicker overall, it keeps the hair that I have there. I don&#x27;t think it has a really strong lather, but that&#x27;s not important to me as long as my hair looks and feels thicker!</li>
    <li> The Shampoo worked fine as a shampoo and did slow my hairloss down, however it paled in comparison to what Progaine did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just need to slow your hairloss down? Go for it! But also take an actual DHT blocker to go with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth every penny! It performed exactly as described. Use as directed and give it some time and you will be amazed with the results.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it would work as well as it has but after a few weeks my hair is fuller and my shower isn&#x27;t clogged! The shampoo itself is great too, it has a nice smell and leaves my hair feeling clean. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product! I love the way it feels on my scalp so refreshing it really helped my hair grow.I recommend buying this to anyone who needs help getting their hair to grow. it takes time but it&#x27;s worth the time and price.</li>
    <li> i am taking &#x27;Ultrax Labs Hair  Shampoo&#x27;  more than three months, there is a little changes in my hairs.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping. Love it.</li>
    <li> Lathers very nicely, and i&#x27;m hard pressed to repeat after the first rinse but I usually do. The clarifying effect of the shampoo is outstanding, and it&#x27;s not so drying/damaging as to necessitate a focused application of conditioner following its use. I like this product and would probably buy again</li>
    <li> Great product! Super fast arrival and it smells amazing. The shampoo is filled with natural ingredients to encourage growth and is seemingly one of the safest more effective ways to stimulate growth. Can&#x27;t wait to see further results!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I love everything about it including the smell. I recently started to see my hair thinning out. For someone who has had thick full hair all her life it was difficult to watch. This shampoo made a difference right away! My boyfriend and all my friends and family noticed that my hair was growing back to the state it was at a younger age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product for the rest of my life if needed! If you are having any hair issues give this great formula a try!</li>
    <li> I got this for my stepmom (who is in her mid 40s and already balding near her hair part). After a couple uses, this product proves true to its claims. We notice the bald spot between her center hair part is less prominent and her confidence improving again. Definitely something we will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Honestly it&#x27;s a really great product! After just a few shampoos my hair immediately become stronger, thicker and with a better looks. I tried different shampoo &amp; conditioners before to help my hair to become stronger but nothing got these great results so fast! I am so happy to have again my hair thicker, stronger and longer! Thank you! Definitely one of the best hair products I never used. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about new hair products but I can say that this one really works. In a short time, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is much fuller. I&#x27;ll continue to use it to see if I get some much needed growth as well.</li>
    <li> I truly love this item! Besides from their packaging-which my item came intact and didn&#x27;t spill anywhere, the results were efficient! I immediately saw a drastic change and stimulation to my scalp! I love this product and reccommend it!</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money for me as I saw zero results. I followed the directions for 3 months and even let it soak in longer sometimes and saw no change in my hairline. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have finished one bottle of this shampoo and I really didn&#x27;t see any hair growing. It did however stop my hair from falling. My hair may have gotten a little thicker but I can&#x27;t really notice. My hair is falling due to hereditary issues, my dad and my grandpa lost his hair at the age of early 20s. I am 21 and I kind of want to do everything possible to keep my hair without spending thousands on Bosely or similar treatments. I decided to try a different shampoo called Phytoworx Organic Hair Loss Shampoo and that one did not help at all, it actually gave me pimples on my forehead. So I recently ordered another bottle of Ultrax Labs Shampoo and I plan to use this because it does stop my hair from falling.</li>
    <li> The scent is so addicting. It has to be doing something great with that smell. :)</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for about 3 weeks and have seen tremendous results. I wash my hair every week and every week, I see growth! Excellent !! Definitely recommending to EVERYONE !!</li>
    <li> I liked this product as soon as I tried it. The shampoo was rich and smelled quite nice, and it produced a foamy lather. And my hair was definitely thicker, and my scalp not as itchy, even after just a few uses. And ... the best part, I&#x27;ve seen hair growth along my hair crown, where my hair has been slowly receding over the years. Another added bonus is that the product is manufactured in the good, ole U.S. of A. And when in comes to health care products, that&#x27;s always a big selling point for me!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best hair treatment product on the market!!! I&#x27;ve been losing hair in the middle of my scalp for some time now. Originally, I didn&#x27;t think it was possible that hair treatments work.&amp;#34;I mean come on, people will believe anything.&amp;#34; I thought but after using this product for 3 to 4 weeks I&#x27;ve actually started to see results. No longer will I wear beanies and caps to cover up my patches! This product has truly changed my life. Also, it feels great to run this through my hair.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase through Amazon of this product, but I actually started using this amazing shampoo about 3 months ago and I have found it is truly awesome!  My hair feels fuller and my thinning areas are filling in.  Being an older woman, over the last 5 years my hair has thinned especially around my hairline and so I was in search of something to help.  Ultrax Labs Hair Surge does exactly this.  The 3 main ingredients are:  caffeine, saw palmetto and ketoconazole and they do miraculously work together to promote new hair growth, while maintaining what you have. I did my research, so I encourage you to do the same if you are skeptical.  It took about 3 weeks to begin seeing some results and I wash my hair every other day.  Nothing else to add except...I am a believer!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only started using this shampoo and already I&#x27;m beginning to feel a thicker, fuller head of hair. I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t shedding like it was before and my hair feels cleaner.I used to wake up and find hair in my pillow but after 3 days of usage i noticed less hair.&lt;br /&gt;My brother who has been also experiencing hair loss for many years has used many brands and he tried this one and liked it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical about this shampoo at the beginning cause there are so many promising brands but now that I&#x27;m beginning to see a difference I believe it&#x27;s really worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are all natural and are known for helping promote hair growth and health so overall I will give it 5 stars and will probably be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product...hands down the last shampoo I will ever use. I went in with no expectations because other products have stated the would work wonders. None has ever come close to the wonders that this product has done for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I was nervous at first because so many hair products I&#x27;ve tried in the past have promised great results and then did not deliver, but this is not one of those products, it totally delivers! The spots I wanted to thicken are already showing improvement and it leaves my hair feeling and smelling awesome.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing...... The caffeine totally wakes your hair follicles up and gets them growing again. In less then 2 weeks I can already see a big difference in the amount and thickness of my hair. This is definitely a product I would recommend to anyone wanting a full head of hair again. Also the shipping was much quicker than was anticipated. 2 thumbs up for sure!</li>
    <li> I washed my hair today for the first time with this shampoo and I&#x27;m really amazed at how my hair looks and feels. It stimulated my scalp and felt really invigorating.  I have fine hair, so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products to improve the volume and thickness. Compared to other products that I&#x27;ve used, Hair Surge left my hair feeling thicker and fuller after just one use.  I&#x27;m really excited to see the results after using the shampoo regularly since I already see positive results!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Ultrax Labs shampoo for only a week and my hair is fuller, more manageable and my split ends have disappeared. Now I don&#x27;t even have to use serum on my hair to make it shine. But the best part is that my hair is staying on my head not on my brush.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, product doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It&#x27;s a great shampoo, wonderful results in hair loss and stimulating hair growth. Simply stay on track with the  directions and you will definitely see the difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> It stimulates hair growth, adds body and thickness to your hair. It also helps with breakage and makes your hair feel thicker and stronger. Ultra Labs shampoo works my hair is fuller, thicker and stronger than before. You should definitely try this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The DHT inhibitor in this product does the trick alongside Rogaine which helps the hair to grow back.  I have hair regrowing in an area where I can see hair used to be missing.  The hairs are bout an inch and a half now. Am disappointed this product is not on Amazon any longer. :(  Had to go to the Ultrax Labs directly which is not as convenient as using Amazon when I am buying other products.</li>
    <li> My hair started shedding last month and my usually thick and full head of hair turned into thin and dull strands. This was unacceptable.  I&#x27;ve used this shampoo about 4 times and already see a big difference.  When I shower, the drain no longer clogs because of my hair and when I brush there are only a few strands left on the brush.</li>
    <li> I tried using the shampoo but couldn&#x27;t really use it that long because the smell of it was too strong for me. I think its the caffeine that makes it so strong. The smell of it is very overpowering that i had to try using it fast. i probably wouldn&#x27;t use it again, overall im glad i tried it for a little bit but didn&#x27;t really see a change in my hair but then i didn&#x27;t use it for a very long time</li>
    <li> This product definitely lives up to the hype surrounding it! What&#x27;s great is that this shampoo starts showing its effects very soon. It will leave hair looking shinier and definitely feeling thicker and fuller. The scent of this shampoo is also a great aspect because it doesn&#x27;t have strong smell at all, many products like this have a medicated smell and this one does not. Also, there is a noticeable decrease in the amount of hair fall after beginning to use this shampoo. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will effectively boost hair growth and leave your hair feeling healthier, this is a great product to invest in!</li>
    <li> I’ve noticed less shedding and breakage when I comb my hair. My hair feels soft and silky and I love the citrusy scent as well as the tingly sensation on my scalp! I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Not good for sensitive scalps</li>
    <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t work. Way too pricey</li>
    <li> Great product, love way it feels on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was hesitant to use it because I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I&#x27;ve spent on pills and other hair growth products that don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it took around three weeks to start seeing results. But the results were well worth waiting for! I&#x27;m definitely noticing less hair loss (on my pillow, in the drain, etc) and my patchy areas are looking fuller. My hair stylist even noticed a difference! I see many other reviewers complaining about the price but in my opinion, it&#x27;s beyond worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to anyone tired of hair growth pills and creams that don&#x27;t work. Be patient with this product and you will see results!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST have shampoo! I used it only twice and can see the results.  When the bottle arrived I was excited to try it out and expected to see changes in a week or so since hair takes time to grow. I was amazed! The shampoo actually made each follicle thicker and softer right away. The scent is also pleasant and contains peppermint oil and mango butter, which from my research are excellent stimulants for the scalp. According to the directions, the best results are seen when you leave it in your hair for 2 minutes and then rinse, repeating this five times per week. The ingredients are stimulating for the scalp and allows the hair follicles to grow quickly. I will definitely be doing that since its working amazingly so far!! A great buy for anyone looking to improve hair quality and have fuller, thicker hair fast!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is one I will be purchasing once the bottle runs out! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medicinal smell to the shampoo was refreshing. Immediately I could tell this shampoo had properties in it that would promote healing. I&#x27;ve used it every night, especially on my scalp and bald areas and can tell that there is now some hair growth starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp isn’t dry and itchy now. In fact, I’ve had less shedding and for the first time, was able to brush my hair straight through just washing my hair with shampoo after my shower. Usually it’s knotty and I have more hair break after I brush. Another plus is that my hair is bouncier, the ends don&#x27;t split and feels lighter too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that after day two, I had less shedding when putting this through my scalp. It&#x27;s been decreasing every day since. I comb my hair with my fingers in the shower and with other shampoos, I could easily pull out a clump of hair. On thin hair, that’s disheartening to see. So I was quite pleased when I stopped losing so much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the only expensive shampoos that has actually worked on my dry hair with good results since the first use.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this shampoo and it arrived really fast! It has a very thick consistency but I combined it with my regular shampoo and it lathers up nicely. It has a subtle yet pleasant smell and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  I have only used it for 3 days so I have not yet seen results. But overall, not bad for a shampoo.</li>
    <li> Really love this shampoo. It has a pleasing scent, and I only needed to use a small amount per wash. Normally after washing my hair, I do experience some breakage and shedding, but with this shampoo, I did not experience breakage nor shedding. The product is really great and I am definitely recommending to my friends and family.  I do expect to see hair growth in due time.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this shampoo. It lathers nicely and since using it a few weeks I have noticed the growth of many baby hairs.  I&#x27;m very pleased to be seeing an improvement in the thinning areas as I have tried many products before with no results.  Combined with the conditioner this treatment is giving me hope!</li>
    <li> Just tried it this morning. My hair feels so refreshed and I didn&#x27;t have any breakage or shedding after shampooing like I usually do! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do over time.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE SHAMPOO, HAIR LOOKS AND FEELS VERY HEALTHY.</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely worked for me and I could notice the new growths after three weeks of continuous daily use.  However, I believe the price is somewhat high for the amount of the shampoo.  For greasy hair you have to use two applications each time to have it be effective.  That also reduces the number of times you can use this and the price becomes even more concerning.  I found other cheaper options with same high quality.</li>
    <li> Great product and it actually does stop my hair from shedding. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is fuller and looks 100% better, I can tell a difference in my hair since I started using this product. Amazing smell too!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for a week now, and I was surprised how quickly it jumped into action! I have noticed that I&#x27;m shedding a lot less than I was before I started using it, for which I am VERY thankful. At first i was surprised by the size of the bottle, its not as large as I expected, but a little bit of it goes a long way. Many of the other hair loss products I have tried smelled overly medicinal or just gross, but this is quite pleasant. An early review, but so pleased with Ultrax!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless of products before after damaging my hair with bleach and I have to say this shampoo has worked wonderfully! My hair is nice and healthy and shiny! And in a short amount of time it has grown a lot . I recommend everyone to use it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> The product does what it claims to do. I noticed my hair feels thicker and stronger after a few uses. Your hair feels great after, and it smells good. Hair Surge is working some type of magic and I noticed significantly less breakage and shedding after the first couple of washes. My scalp feels better too. I was surprised with the results after being about skeptical about purchasing, but this product delivers.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to keep using this.  I felt this working the minute I put it on.  It only requires a small amount and lathers up nice.  It lightly tingles on the scalp and rinses out cleanly.  I was surprised at how clean my scalp feels and how soft my hair is!  My co-worker complimented my no frizz hair.  My hair already has been texture and no hair was in my comb after my shower.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> The first thing most people do when they starts to lose hair is try all of these expensive and useless products. When you try Ultrax Labs Hair Surge, you’ll start to noticed significant hair growth in balding areas in just the first 2 weeks of use. This shampoo has a thick, consistent texture and a wonderful scent. The product have a few ingredients which are recognized to aid in treating hair loss, such as Sawtooth Palmetto and Keta. Ultrax Labs Hair Surge is highly recommend to anyone who wants to regrow their hair, or simply improve the quality of their hair.</li>
    <li> Item was well packed and arrived super fast after placing order. I love how my hair feels after using shampoo. I can feel a difference after the first few days. Looking forward to fuller and thicker hair. I highly recommend this product. Thanks, one happy customer.</li>
    <li> Wow. This is such a great product.  Works as is says. After one use my hair was softer.  The product doesn&#x27;t smell funky like other hair growth products.  I have bleach damaged that has been pretty permanent and this shampoo seems to be doing the trick.  Shipping was super fast.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend and you!</li>
    <li> Seems good but, too drying for my hair. can&#x27;t stay with this...</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smells. Very herbal and clean. It also suds up a nice amount and leaves hair shiny and fluffy. I did notice less breakage even after the first wash. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Beautiful styled bottle. Loved the design..Shampoo smells wonderful..Shampoo is clear and thick..Gives a good  lather Not a whole lot of excessive lather. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot.. Washes out easily. scalp/hair feels really clean.Since  I have locs..My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out. My Boyfriend says my hair smells great..Hair soft to touch.,I will give another review of the product in the coming weeks to see if my hair grows..Otherwise awesome product....thank you.</li>
    <li> Did this really just happen? My hair looks VISIBLY thicker and fuller after ONE USE. It&#x27;s curlier and looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend noticed my hair looked massively bigger and better when he got home. He also said &amp;#34;more contained&amp;#34; (I usually have crazy hair.) It looked more under control and &amp;#34;styled.&amp;#34; He did not know I had tried the product or what it was for. I now have to tell him not to use it because he has naturally thick hair and that would be insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience of this product is that as it was sitting on my head in the shower I felt something like a tightness on my scalp (not uncomfortable, it was in a good way.) The best way to put it, is that I felt like I scalp was stronger, more tight and held together. I never realized before that my scalp had always felt... loose, if that makes sense. I was musing the question to myself- do people with thick hair always feel this scalp &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; feeling? Of course they wouldn&#x27;t know without a comparison... but who is going to take hair-loss shampoo? If you want that, use Suave, believe me. I used Suave this summer at a friend&#x27;s house for a month, and my hair was falling out 10-15 stands in one hand! I finally connected the dots and changed. The hair-loss slowed, but I had still lost a lot of hair during that time. That&#x27;s why I am using this product- to recover what I lost, and also to grow beyond (and I have always wanted thicker hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I am going to keep using this and give another review in 1-3 months.</li>
    <li> I just got it I can&#x27;t comment on if it help&#x27;s grow any hair back but after the first use it made my hair thicker. The smell is ok I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s amazing like some of the other people. I will update this later and see if it get&#x27;s 5 stars or goes down.</li>
    <li> Stopped my hair from falling out within a week. On top of that, it smells great. Nice product!</li>
    <li> After using this product, I was quite surprised with the results. The caffeine supplementation in the shampoo definitely helped with hair growth. After a few uses I could tell that my hair felt thicker to touch. I also noticed that some of the split ends I had were going away as well. With all the active ingredients in here I was skeptical about the smell, but the lemony/citrus smell the shampoo leaves in your hair smells great as well. The directions on the bottle say to use the shampoo 5 times a week, however I have been using it everyday and it has provided awesome results.</li>
    <li> Love it. Its a great product for those who want to stimulate hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> I greatly recommend this product. Fast active when washing my hair I no longer have to remove my hair from the drain and has a great smell. I was a little unsure about the product but now I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance and used this shampoo. Fast delivery :-)  If your having hair loss and want something that works hair surge is what you want!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! This is my second time I am purchasing this product. I m 33 years old and I do have hair loss problem when I start using it, I feel the difference in one week. Now hair stop falling and growly awesome. I recommended all my friend and family. Perfect gift as well.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that &amp;#34;this product works&amp;#34;! I always have had thinning hair over 7 years ago after I had my first child. Im guessing my hormone levels had changed and resulted in shedding. I have tried a variety of products at rite aid, online websites or beauty supply stores but none showed any improvement to my condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon the Ulrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Growth Stimulating Shampoo 2 months ago and I have been using it for over a month. The bottle lasted me a little over a month and I saw Dramatic results in my hair growth! This is going to be my second bottle and I&#x27;m super excited that this process will continue my growth. I recommend this product for anyone who is interested in restimulating their hair follicles and scalp to ensure visible hair growth. Everything takes time but this product works!</li>
    <li> As I get older, my hair has become thinner and it has gotten drier and breaks a lot. So far I only used this product twice but that is all I need to make this review. First off this shampoo smells amazing and that means a lot to me. The biggest difference I have seen is in my brush. This product did not dry out my hair like many other products do and because of that my hair isn&#x27;t breaking and falling out. I am excited that if I can get these amazing results after just two uses, I can&#x27;t wait to see what five days in a row will do. My hair is soft and fuller feeling than it has ever been after shampooing it. Not to mention that this product didn&#x27;t dry out my scalp and leave it flaky like all the others I have tried do. I have a very sensitive scalp and Ultrax Labs stopped my flakiness. I  am not use to my hair feeling so nice and soft and full of body. After feeling my hair, my finance wants to use it too because he felt and saw the difference. I have been searching shampoo that would help improve my hair and I have now found that product.</li>
    <li> Finally there&#x27;s a product out there that works for treating hair that is shedding. I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos but none of them worked, until I saw this product online. I decided to give it a try, and it&#x27;s working. My hair is no longer shedding as much. I&#x27;m positive this will keep on improving with longer use!</li>
    <li> Unimpressive product; takes 3/4 pumps to lather on my very short hair, that being the case and the small size of the bottle this stuff will not last long at all. At its prohibitive cost, it is highly unlikely I will use this stuff long enough to know if it has any hair regrowth benefits. On the bright side it smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> Used this product in hopes of hair growth. Washed my hair at least 3 times a day, massaging my scalp no more than 2 minutes. Instead of good results, my hair started falling out!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been a very good product. I recently suffered hair loss due to an illness and was experiencing very slow hair re-growth. After using this shampoo on my hair and also on my brows, which fell out too, I saw thickening after just over a week. This shampoo not only smells great, but also lathers up very well. It has been great for my brows and now I can pinch sections of my hair too!</li>
    <li> The product works well, the fragrance smells a little off but besides that it does the work</li>
    <li> Been using this shampoo off and on since 2013. I like trying different products for my hair but I always come back to this one. I finally have given up trying new products and decided to stick with this one. So far no complaints, I suggest you try it yourself if you have any hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a short time, and it has made a drastic difference in the amount of hair that I shed in the shower as well as while brushing and styling my hair.</li>
    <li> I received my order alittle before the expected delivery date,(which was impressive) &amp; I have to say this stuff is awesome, it started working within 3 days of using it, plus my hair already looks alittle thicker &amp; shinier. The price is definitely worth it. Apposed to the expensive ones that don&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works.  Thicker hair and less fallout.  I see new growth.  This is my second bottle.  Wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge is a great shampoo for those that are experience mild to moderate hair loss. I was given a bottle for free to try and review, and I really liked it. I found the lather-level to be moderate, which gives a great clean feeling, but is still easy to rinse out. For those that have never used this before, read the directions! You’ll need to leave this in for up to 2 minutes before rinsing for it to work. This is a daily-use shampoo, so plan on using it every time you shower in order to see results. Even after just a couple of uses, there appears to be less hair in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is packaged in an 8-ounce bottle and it has a pump top. The pump helps reduce the amount used, so the bottle does last for a while, despite its small size. You really don’t need a lot of this shampoo for it to clean hair and work. When applying, focus on the scalp, as that’s where the hair grows from. The shampoo contains caffeine, and there’s a slight (though pleasant) tingle when you massage it in. The shampoo has a light, almost citrus scent to it that would be nice for men or women. It doesn’t smell medicated, like other hair stimulating shampoos do. &#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this probably isn’t a factor for most people looking for hair-loss shampoo, the product is made in the U.S. and comes in a recyclable bottle. The recycling code is 1, for those with limited recycling facilities.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write a review, but this product deserves a review.  This product works awesome.  It makes my thinning hair much more thicker and fuller.  I don&#x27;t know what or how it works, but it does.  I love this product and will be buying again.  To save on the amount I use, I wash my hair with regular shampoo first, then apply a small amount of this shampoo on the top of my head that is thinning.  It seems to lather a lot better once I wash it first with a different shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell and super enthused about this shampoo.  It may be a bit pricey, but it works!</li>
    <li> I have been using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Shampoo for about a week. The handy pump on the bottle makes it very easy to apply. It takes two applications each time I wash my hair as the first does not provide much lather, however, the second is smooth and lathers quite well. Each application is a very small amount - less than the size of a dime in my hand. I noticed an almost immediate improvement in the condition of my hair - softer, silkier, shinier! And, now, after the first week, I have also noticed that my ends are not as split and frizzy and there are very few stray hairs on my clothing and car seats. It has a slight scent, but for the most part, it is not noticeable, which I enjoy because I like the scent of my body spray or cologne to be noticed, not what is on my hair. I am happy with this product and, while I thought it was a little expensive initially, have decided it is well worth the price. I will definitely continue to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be a quality company as the  packaging was well put together and the order was delivered within a few days of placing my order, although I opted for the free shipping option.</li>
    <li> It doesnt work well, seems I got the wrong bottle or something.. It leaves eyes also burning... Hair fall is much visible now.</li>
    <li> I have had thick hair all my life, but recently due to health issues I have been loosing my hair.  I am have been shedding hair like crazy, I figured I will go ahead and give Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Shampoo a try.  I have been using it for two weeks and I love it.  My hair is not shedding like it was, it feels thicker and fuller than before. I would recommend this product to anyone!  I have already ordered a back up bottle to ensure I do not run out!!!</li>
    <li> This product works. It took a couple of days to actually notice a difference. My hair is now growing at a faster rate and I notice less hair falling off.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I was skeptical at first, but after using a couple of times, I notice a difference on my head.  There is a great feeling while applying the shampoo, and it has a great smell.</li>
    <li> Excited about this product. Unlike other shampoos it has an easy to use pump. As far as hair stimulating shampoos go, this one has a nice tingle, so it feels like it is working right away. It contains caffeine which is unique and Ketoconazole.  Monoxidil is what is usually in these types  of shampoos however, this one is different. I immediately had less shedding during the lather ups--which is great. Shedding is a problem for me. I&#x27;m waiting to see how soon it will be before my hair is visibly thicker. I think this is a good start.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t really certain if this product was actually worth spending what I consider to be a considerable amount of money on a shampoo. After my first wash I was surprised at how good it made my hair feel and look. I am somewhat a skeptic when it pertains to hair care products that promise results just after a few uses but I must say that it has been four days since I have been faithfully using Ultrax Labs Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Shampoo and I must let it be known that this product certainly deliverers! I am seeing my hairline loss restored just after a mere four days! I am simply floored. I think that the caffeine within this shampoo is magic and I would truly recommend this shampoo to anyone that has thinning hair. It works wonders.</li>
    <li> I must say it&#x27;s a small bottle for the amount you pay. The directions require that you wash your hair with it five times a week, so it didn&#x27;t last that every long. I believe the shampoo only lasted 2-3 weeks. However, my hair felt extremely thick and healthy. Usually my hair feels really flat and I constantly have to &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; it up. But with this shampoo I felt like I had more hair on my head and it wasn&#x27;t falling out as much. My hair felt really volumized, a lot better then when it&#x27;s done at the salon.  There was a big difference in my hair when I switched back to the cheap stuff.  I really like the shampoo but it&#x27;s too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> Definitely amazed by this shampoo! I’ve always been embarrassed by my thin hair, but after using this product I’ve confidently tried many new hairstyles that I never would have before. Co-workers and friends have been complimenting my newly healthy hair almost immediately. When applied to the scalp, an invigorating and massaging feeling is felt right away. Every time I wash my hair now it’s as if I’m at a professional salon. I also love how this shampoo smells. I’ve also noticed less split ends. My hair is more shinny and smoother overall once I started using this shampoo. When brushing my hair, I’ve noticed less hairs that have fallen out or get collected in the brush. With the aid of this shampoo, my hair also gets less oily in between washes, so it looks cleaner and healthier longer.  I’m so happy with this shampoo that I’m also looking into purchasing the accompanying conditioner. I would recommend both these products to both men and women with thinner hair. An added bonus is that these products come with free shipping and I received my package in only 3 days. No complaints at all. No doubt, I’ve proudly become a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> Donot use it ...........&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hairs fall 75% more than ever, my hairs look like some dry &amp; rough shrub and feel like a pack of wire wool .</li>
    <li> I read and saw a few other reviews I ordered my product since I have a few thinning spots in my hair. I have been very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> I am skeptical with all hair growth products, but this one showed some really good results for me. I was starting to lose a lot of hair in the shower and I decided I would spring for something low key that could solve the issue. This was the ticket!! When the shampoo arrived, I immediately opened the package and gave it a smell. At first, the product seemed a little over powering of chemicals, but once i tried it in the shower, it really had a good smell. Nothing that was off putting of anything like that. I also saw nice growth in my Beard!!! Great product!</li>
    <li> It arrived the following day, it arrived well without spillage. It smells really good, I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> This Product Is Amazing. Definately Improved My Hair Texture. Now It Is Thicker Than Eve. This Product Is Legit Heaven Sent</li>
    <li> This shampoo works! I was a bit skeptical at first, because it suggests using at least five times a week for optimal growth, and I usually only wash my hair two or three times a week because my old shampoo would (for some reason) dry out my hair if I used it too often. That is NOT the case with this shampoo! Not only am I comfortable using it on a more regular basis, but it has kept my hair clean and moisturized. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week but I&#x27;ve already noticed less shedding and breakage. My hair length is just below my shoulders, and I use three pumps to get a good lather. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how my hair continues to respond to this amazing shampoo!</li>
    <li> Very impressed!! I have damaged hair that breaks and falls out. I&#x27;ve notices that the breaking has reduces as well as the amount of split ends. My hair looks and feels thicker and voluminious. My hair looks alive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been losing hair for as long as I can remember - not sure if it&#x27;s normal for everyone but it&#x27;s certainly normal for women in my family. The reason for this is that my scalp is very sensitive. I am thankful for running across this solution because shampoos which do the same thing that this does cost so much more. My hair stopped shedding after the first week of use which is amazing considering how many other products I&#x27;ve tried to no avail. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and I can&#x27;t stress that enough. Losing hair is embarrassing for everyone. It adds years to your age! I&#x27;m going to keep purchasing this product because I&#x27;ve seen such great results and I sincerely recommend that you try it at least once. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hair was starting to thin so I thought I would try this product. It made my hair feel nice and thick again. I love this product!</li>
    <li> this shampoo is so great Im no longer am ashamed of my  hair.  I started to loss my hair around my edges . It was so embarrassing. The first thing I did was try all of different kinds of  products. Until I found the amazing  Ultrax Hair Surge Caffeine Shampoo, I was so amazed. I have my healthy hair back. This shampoo is feels great on my scalp and has a luscious  lather. It gives a sensation of tingling. The results were amazing. I started to notice hair growth after just a couple of washes.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and have really noticed a difference. My hair has gotten thicker, and I haven&#x27;t been losing handfuls of hair each time I comb it. Also with such a nice lather and the way it smells how could you not love it!!</li>
    <li> smells ok think it works great, could lather better though, make sure to wet hair fully and it lathers up better</li>
    <li> I have been using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo a few days already and I have already&lt;br /&gt;noticed my hair is fuller and looks healthier.  I planned to keep using it and watch my hair grow even thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, to people who are suffering from hair loss or want to use a more natural product.  Its gives your hair&lt;br /&gt;a revamp.</li>
    <li> I picked this up after seeing a recommendation in the GQ , mentioning the ketoconazole and caffeine in helping out with hair loss. I have never been big on being proactive but with recent hair thinning, I decided to take one easy step to help my hair if any.  So far I have been really happy with this shampoo, it&#x27;s gentle as can be, I love the smell and it does thicken up my hair some.</li>
    <li> Great product smells great and fast shipping</li>
    <li> Awesome product  Loved it</li>
    <li> no way I will buy, simply wasting money !!! Don&#x27;t listen positive comments</li>
    <li> This review is from my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes suffer from a lot of hair fall, but so far I keep it under control with a certain shampoo which is quite expensive. Thankfully I have very thick hair so even if I lose a lot of hair every day from just one brushing session; it doesn’t make a difference at all. Sometimes my hair fall is caused by stressors during my night shifts at the hospital as a Nurse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I age, hair loss has become more of a problem for me-I am allergic to many artificial scents and strong scents so am kind of afraid to give this a try, but my husband bought it anyway for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiencing hair fall on a daily basis is something normal to most people. It is even normal to shed 10’s or hundreds of  strands each day as part of the hair growth cycle but do remember that beyond that number would not be consider normal anymore. Exceeding more than a hundred strands per day would be called excessive hair loss and it can be from numerous things such as hereditary disorders, illness, major surgery, hormonal problems, child birth and delivery, medication and infections, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I need to work on, is its prevention. Remember that in terms of hair loss, keeping the hair and scalp clean is very important in preventing hair fall. Some hair loss has something to do with medication you take in. Some could be due to infection or any fungal scalp condition. What you can do is either checked in with your doctor or you may use shampoo or scalp lotion that provides nourishment to your scalp – stopping hair fall and stimulate hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this particular shampoo very helpful to me. While it is not reasonably as expensive as my usual treatment shampoo, It’s quite nourishing and untangles my hair without using a conditioner! After a week of use I could feel and see the difference. I observe lesser shedding hairs while brushing my hair. Moreover, the bounce and the shine, it really feels different than before. I WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!e. I WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Very good product. It&#x27;s been one use and I can already feel the effects.</li>
    <li> This product really works. Even after a few days i can see a fuller look to my hair. I will recommend it to all my friends and I suggest you purchase this product too.</li>
    <li> I have especially thin and fine hair on crown of my head, but this product has improved the thickness and texture of my hair. I also feel I have more volume in my hair too. It&#x27;s very simple to use and I don&#x27;t even use any other hair growth products other than this. This shampoo has a nice smell and consistency, it doesn&#x27;t take much to lather. After washing off the shampoo, I can tell my hair is heavier than usual. It gives a shine in my hair after blowdrying and is much more smoother and soft. My hair doesn&#x27;t break that easily and I rarely see anymore split ends. I definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone who has the same hair problems I had.</li>
    <li> After having used this product for a little over a week, I would have to say that I love it!  It smells similar to tea tree oil; I love that smell.  It also leaves my hair feeling healthy. My hair feels more &amp;#34;put together,&amp;#34; I guess you could say.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, five stars to a product that is worth the money!</li>
    <li> WOW, WOW, WOW, AWESOME PRODUCT, IN LESS THAN A WEEKS TIME, MY THINNING HAIR  HAS BECOME FULLER, FULL OF BODY, BOUNCE, HEALTHY, SHINER, SMOOTH, LESS FRIZZY, SO SOFT, TOUCHABLE, I CAN&#x27;T KEEP MY HANDS FROM TOUCHING HOW NICE IT FEELS, FOR IT BRINGS ME JOY, JOY, AFTER YEARS AND YEARS, OF STRUGGLING TO FIND A SOLUTION TO MY THINNING HAIR, AND NOW I AM DELIGHTED TO SAY THIS IS WHAT MY HAIR HAS BEEN HUNGRY FOR, I HAVE MY HAIR BACK, AND IT&#x27;S HASN&#x27;T BEEN A FULL MONTH. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THICK CURLY HAIR WHEN I WAS AT A YOUNGER AGE, WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE DISPATED AS I GOTTEN OLDER, USING ALL THE WRONG PRODUCTS, WHICH WAS TOTALLY BAD FOR THE . I NOW NO LONGER USE ANY STORE BOUGHT SHAMPOO WHICH TENDS TO DRY THE HAIR, MAKING IT BRITTLE, KILLING THE HEALTHY HAIR FOLLICLES. THANK YOU ULTRA LABS HAIR SURGE, MY HAIR THANK YOU, THE BEST OF THE BEST, THE AWESOME BEST OUT THERE. I WILL SURLY BE COMING BACK FOR MORE AND MORE, WONDERFUL HOW IT TRANSFORM MY DRY BRITTLE LIFELESS HAIR. HOORAY !!1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES, YES, YES!</li>
    <li> As with all products, it will work for some and not for others. Will this be worth a try? In my case, yes. I advise everyone to test a small section of hair first in case of any bad reaction. This is true for all products. I see increased thickness right away, so I will recommend that everyone give it a try. It helps to combine this with daily scalp massaging.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is just what the doctor ordered. Not only does it leave your hair feeling moisturized, it really does aid in regrowing your hair. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell like many other shampoos do.  A little goes a long way and it lathers very well, just as long as you have damp hair. It also pays to be consistent with using the shampoo and washing your hair -slow and steady wins the race. The price seems a little steep, but you can&#x27;t put a price on restoring your hair. It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is ok, but at that price, you cannot use it daily for too long. It does make my hair feel thicker and fuller.</li>
    <li> Cant really say if it works or not.. The Lipogaine is what I believe makes the most difference out of all the things I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, good results!</li>
    <li> This is a mixed review on this product. The Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo has a horrible smell to it. Also, the product fumes irritated my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;However, if you can get past these 2 things, it did make my hair feel soft and made my hair look more fuller than it is. I have very fine hair, so that is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to use this shampoo. Today I tried this shampoo for the second time and it really works. You can actually feel the difference in your second hair wash. Once you wash and comb your hair the hair falls much lesser then it use to be. Also it doesn’t contain any kind of harsh smell. You do need to use a few pumps to get a good lather but it leaves my hair feeling very clean. I would definitely recommend using this shampoo for once that have hair fall problems</li>
    <li> After using Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx hair growth supplements I decided to try another one of their products, and I was completely satisfied with them once again. My hair has already become very full and lucious with their supplements, but coupled with this shampoo my hair growth has accelerated even more. It leaves my hair feeling very smooth and shiny and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This Ultrax hair shampoo has been a disaster for me. I want to start this by saying that my experience is not necessarily what your experience will be. If the 5 star reviews are to be trusted, this has worked extremely well for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it has been worse than ineffective for me. I have been losing hair for 3 years at a steady, but noticeable rate. My scalp was started to really show to the right and left side of my slight widow&#x27;s peak, along the slope where the top of my head meets the side of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Ultrax a few months ago, and I immediately saw a change after using it... within a week, about 25% of my hair had fallen out along this area of my head. My logic to keep with it was that, like monoxidil, caffeine would be increasing the blood flow to my follicles. This can cause hair that is in a certain stage (starved of enough nutrients) to fall out, which will normally then be replaced by new, healthier hair follicles. However, months later, no new hair has grown back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, 50% of the hair that I started with in the aforementioned areas has fallen out. It is my worst nightmare. I&#x27;ve finally stopped it altogether because it is now clear this product is not only NOT helping, but it is making it significantly worse. Basically, if I were to judge my hair loss in the last three years, I&#x27;d say that I lost 3 more years of hair in the span of 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted everyone to be aware that... somehow - I don&#x27;t know how... this product can have the reverse effect of what it is designed to do. I am a health 27 year old male, and am active, and no one on my mother&#x27;s side of the family has hair-loss issues (supposedly mother&#x27;s side is where we get hair-loss genes). So I may be the extremely unlucky case here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because this happened to me doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean this will happen to you, and that you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product. Please don&#x27;t let me destroy this product for you. But also, please keep my results in mind.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is like a answer to both my husband and I prayers, it did exactly what it advertised and it smells so good!!! I absolutely love it and have recommended it to every family member and friend. Thank you so much for this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good shampoo I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days and I can already tell the difference in the thickness of my hair smells good , feels refreshed and deep cleaned . The only issue it leaves my hair a little to dry but it does improve the volume in hair .</li>
    <li> I must have 15 hair products in my bathroom so testing another product is typical in my hair world.  I bleach and color my hair every two and a half weeks.  This process has broken my hair and has left random spots where new growth is minimal.  My hair lacks luster and retains residue after washing because it is so dry.  After the first wash with Surge, I was amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The no lather system stopped my hair from drying out&lt;br /&gt;* My hair actually felt clean and free of residue in the shower&lt;br /&gt;* No shedding while I combed through the wet hair&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s as if my hair plumped up after drying&lt;br /&gt;* When I flat iron those irritating fly aways are tamed and lay flat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually excited to continued success with Surge shampoo and immediately ordered the conditioner!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is now my favorite.  I have color treated hair which it lathers nicely on, and leaves smelling great in addition to it&#x27;s growth properties.  My hair growth and overall quality improvement is definitely noticeable.  This bottle is long lasting and worth it to buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge caffeine shampoo and Hair Solace caffeine conditioner after noticing some hair coming out when showering. These products have made me much more confident about my hair now than when I was using my regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every few days, I would wash my hair with my usual shampoo and noticed some hair strands in my hand after lathering. I was worried because a few family members have receding hairlines so I was worried I might be starting mine. I like my hair fairly short so it would be very noticeable if I were losing my hair. I purchased the Hair Surge caffeine shampoo and Hair Solace conditioner from Ultrax Labs on a whim. I am very happy about this purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hair Surge caffeine shampoo is great. It leaves my hair and scalp feeling clean, strong, and best of all I’m not worried about my hair coming out. After a few days of use, I no longer noticed hair strands on my hands after lathering my hair with this shampoo. I feel more confident and am so happy about this purchase. The Hair Surge caffeine shampoo from Ultrax Labs is great. 5 stars</li>
    <li> I really love it! The compounds are  are able to block hair loss and its good for male and female use.&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product if you are trying to grow your hair or stop hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it to friend and family.</li>
    <li> I just got this a week ago and have been using it regularly.  So far my hair has seemed to have more body to it.  Will have to wait and see whether it actually stimulates any regrowth.</li>
    <li> Light citrus-type smell, feels good on the hair. No effect noticed after 1 bottle, and most likely won&#x27;t buy a 2nd one. Won&#x27;t commit to multiple bottles per year.</li>
    <li> Works for me... worth trying. May seem expensive but I rather pay more for something that works than for something that does not.</li>
    <li> I loved this alternative shampoo. I have weak, stringy, fine hair that sheds like crazy every time i brush it, comb it, or run my fingers through it. I loved this shampoo because, within a few days of using it, I found that my shedding was cut in half. I&#x27;m excited to continue using it and to see how it alters the health of my hair in the long-run. Also smells really nice!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this purchase and product! After undergoing chemo treatments for thyroid cancer I lost some of my hair due to shedding, and after about two weeks after using this product, I noticed a significant improvement of shedding hair. For anyone who might be on the fence about this product, don&#x27;t be...you will be amazed. Looking forward to seeing even more results with continued use!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Beauty Superstore Plus, and received it in RECORD TIME! I received the product a mere two days after ordering it, and I even qualified for free shipping, which was great! The product arrived 4 days before the SOONEST estimated arrival date. I have been using the product for the past few days, and I am very pleased with its quality and results. Every time I have used it, I have felt a subtle tingle in my spine, as if it is awakening and being invigorated. My hair tangles easily, but my hair has brushed out nicely after using this product with or without conditioner. My hair looks and feels more voluminous and healthy. In fact, areas on my head where I&#x27;ve noticed some hair loss already look fuller! I was shocked that this product works so well and from the first usage, as advertised! Also, I have sensitive skin, but this product has not bothered my skin in any way. The product does not smell fruity like most products, but this is not a problem for me. In fact, I sort of like this fact! This is a high quality product and has fast results. The shipping from Beauty Superstore Plus was SUPER FAST. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have only used ultrax shampoo for a short time but love the results. It lathers well and smells good. It tingles your skelp so you can feel it working. My hair feels really clean and looks thicker after usuing it and I&#x27;m seeing less hair shedding. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after another week. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to stimulate hair growth. I can&#x27;t wait to try the ultrax conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!!  Ever since I had a baby my hair has been weak and brittle. I have finally found a product that restores life back into my hair. It has been strong and healthy for weeks now and it smells delicious. I pair it with the Ultrax caffeine conditioner for the ultimate hair indulgence. Go out and purchase this shampoo. It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> Amazing hair shampoo! At first I was kind of scepticle about it because during lather it make your hair feel oily but it washed out very easily. This product made my hair feel thicker and gave it good volume. Good for people who don&#x27;t wash their hair every day. Even after the third day without washing it still had volume and very little grease.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the military and has to wear a hat most of the time and his hair is thinning. When he was deployed he asked me to find him some pills or shampoo or somethingg to help because he was starting to feel very self conscious. He is very much an &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t care about any products&amp;#34; kind of man. He doesn&#x27;t even use unscented lotion when his skin is uncomfortably dry. He does not spend any money on his appearance! That being said, I was shocked to find out that as his bottle was running out, he asked me to get some more. Even more so when I told him it was almost $50 (I expected him to flip out that I paid that for the first bottle) and he said please just get more!!! I do see a difference myself for sure, so its not just the placebo effect.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo it&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and what I was looking for Ultrax Labs always delivers and never fails this stuff works so well that I keep waiting for a genie to pop out of the bottle</li>
    <li> What appealed to me the most to try this product was; it can be used by both men and women, all natural and safe for all hair types, and is made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;I have ethnic hair, curly and thin, and besides I am going grey. My hair is very sensitive to any type of chemical treatment, so I don’t even dye anymore. My hair loss reduced as I stopped with all the chemicals, but I still have the thinning spots and I miss my lioness look full head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo my hair about 2 or 3 times a week only, and I was aware that it might take longer to see some new growth, as I used the product less often than indicated, but I noticed  in the first week a visible improvement to my hair thickness, fullness and well defined curls, which I loved it! I can’t wait to see it fuller and longer!&lt;br /&gt;Of course, like any product of this type, is no guaranteed to work for everyone. The only way to know if is going to work for you is to try it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a great sent you it my mom and I get hair breakage in winter and it works great it&#x27;s next job was my grandma and her mission to treat her bald spot and she loves it i am gonna have to get another one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been 3 days and i do already feel a difference.  It doesn&#x27;t give much of a lather but it does clean.  I was a bit skeptical because of my psoriasis; glad i took the chance on this product i do feel stubbs; like hair growth.  I do recommend if you buy this product you need the set it does leave hair dry as much shampoos do but, i always use the multibreakage conditioner.  Gonna send out for the Ultrax Labs Conditioner.  Will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> Wow! I was not expecting this product to work so well, especially after only a few washes. My hair is already noticeably thicker and has considerably more volume - and it smells great! The shampoo smells wonderfully, it has hints of citrus and mint and a subtle air of coffee. There is a decent amount of product in the bottle, as  I can see it lasting over a month. I will definitely reorder this when it runs out!</li>
    <li> To my surprise, I&#x27;m delighted with the results of Ultrax products (soooo many companies don&#x27;t deliver on their promises).  After only a couple of weeks of use, I noticed a distinct decline in the amount of hair lost during each shower, and I no longer needed to use a &amp;#34;fill-in&amp;#34; powder to diminish the contrast between my hair and my scalp. In  fact, I can&#x27;t  even see my scalp anymore!  I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and my husband is lathering up with Hair Surge, too.  I also use Ultrax Hair Lush Gel, so can&#x27;t really distinguish which product is most responsible for the good effects.  Wish Ultrax products were less expensive, but since I do my own styling and coloring, I rationalize the cost.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh clean citrus smell. Leaves your hair feeling clean and doesnt have too much of a strong after smell. After my first wash it left my hair feeling luxurious very well hydrated and actually felt thicker after only one use. I would highly reccomend this product to anyone looking to help regrow and hydrate their hair .</li>
    <li> I have been recently shedding a lot hair and it has been increasingly getting worse. I decided to try this product out and so far I am loving it! I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is becoming thicker and has a much more natural shine to it. I&#x27;m hoping to continue to see great results and an end to the shedding!</li>
    <li> This really is useless for anything but a shampoo.  Don&#x27;t expect the same results as the hired reviewers input.  Amazon really needs to put a stop to these false reviews for money ratings.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! I am losing much less hair with this product. I noticed a large amount of hair falling out in the shower before I started using this shampoo. Now, there is a minimal amount of loss. Overall, I am happy with this product. I plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> My elderly aunt whose hair has been thinning due to age, loves the shampoo.  She states her hair feels thicker and doesn&#x27;t seem to lose as much hair after shampooing. The fragrance is not overpowering or unplesant, in fact, she likes the smell very much and has no negative reaction to using the shampoo. Her hair does look more stylish these days. Granted, it did take a few shampoos to notice a difference, so for those not seeing an immediate difference, your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I dont know what they put in this formula, but I can say, man, it works!&lt;br /&gt;I lost a lot of hair after giving birth and my hair looked thinner than before.&lt;br /&gt;When I took pictures, I could see my scalp! That was bothering me.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product by the end of January and I feel my hair is fuller and its growing fast!&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that the bottle is small (8 oz), so first I wash my hair with a regular shampoo than the second wash I use this product and I let it act for 2 min. We are in April and the bottle is still full. The shampoo is pricey but it last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Hi!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I am amazed at how great it works!  My hair loss has stopped.  My hair is growing again and getting thicker and healthier as well.  This is a wonderful and special product!  I recommend this product to everyone!  :-)</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my choice to purchase this shampoo for my thinning hair. I can really tell a difference in my hairs fullness, and compliments keep coming from my family and friends about the way I look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past few weeks. I have little baby hairs that have started poking out at my hair line and I&#x27;ve also noticed I haven&#x27;t had as much hair loss since I started using. I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the Ultrax Labs Hair Maxx DHT Blocking Hair Loss Hair Growth Nutrient Solubilized Keratin Vitamin Supplement. Also available here on Amazon. Both have been doing wonders on my hair. My hair was thinning, constantly falling out. Now, I can feel strength and my hair looks and feels healthy!!! Happy customer here :)</li>
    <li> first i gotta say i love my prime account because of the swift delivery and after a few unsuccessful attempts at using other hair abatement products; Propecia for Men,Minoxidil Topical and ‎Men&#x27;s Rogaine which yielded disastrous results- i can sincerely say Ultrax Labs has struck a happy cord with me - after just one week, or three shampoo&#x27;s I have noticed my hair is a little thicker wavy and beginning to show some growth around my temples.  I&#x27;m a guy who has male pattern baldness and i&#x27;m somewhat happy with the immediate results i&#x27;m already seeing….Anything is worth a shot over losing one&#x27;s hair….finger&#x27;s crossed</li>
    <li> I have been worried about losing my hair around my hairline and want to try something that will grow the hair a little thicker in that area. What i have noticed is that this shampoo cleans my hair and makes it very soft without stripping it. My curls felt hydrated,  I was surprised because this is mostly used for hair loss. it does not have a strong scent and smells a little bit like tea tree oil but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I have been using nealy a month but I can&#x27;t see any hair growth still my hair are same nothing changes 😥</li>
    <li> So far this product has worked great. My hair has been thinning out for a few years now and I figured I would just have to live with it. This product has changed that, my hair has been slowly growing all over my head again. pretty soon I&#x27;ll have a full set of hair again.</li>
    <li> There is no such thing as miracle hair growth but I do have to say, this product works really quite good. Like anything in this type of product, it does take a little time before you start to see results but I was on the verge of actually just shaving my head bald and so I gave this a shot, expecting it not to work. Well, it turns out, it really is quite good. I started seeing some spouts show up here where I was sporting a chrome dome for a long time and there but more importantly my thinning hair looks quite a bit thicker now. I&#x27;d have to say, it&#x27;s really quite good!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have been using the conditioner and it is amazing! So I decided to try the shampoo as well, my hair feels so much thicker and smoother from these products!  Definitely a must try for anyone wanting thicker hair. Not to mention it smells great!</li>
    <li> A couple days ago I decided to try the Ultrax Labs conditioner and it worked to perfection. The I thought will if the conditioner worked so great why not give the shampoo a try, which is exactly what I did. Using both the shampoo and conditioner was the best thing I could do for my hair. My hair feel softer than ever and unlike other shampoo that leaves your hair feeling heavy, this product adds a new life to your entire head. I noticed that I can go longer without washing my hair because it doesn&#x27;t feel as itchy as it would with other shampoos. I can now go multiple days without washing my hair which also saves me money from having to buy shampoo and conditioner. If you want radiant hair this is defiantly the product for you. I recommend purchasing the conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am surprisingly impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve been dealing with shedding hair my entire life. It seemed like nothing I tried would stop the madness. So far I have not been disappointed using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Shampoo. Not only is my hair fuller and thicker than ever after less than a week of use, but my it&#x27;s so soft and shiny I have been complimented on my hair multiple times. I highly recommend this product for anyone with shedding, or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Received my order yeaterday and was expecting it until Monday!  Super fast shipping. Can&#x27;t wait to see more great results from this amazing product!</li>
    <li> I have been taking propecia for over 10 years, which has slowed the hereditary hair loss but I wanted something more. I made my purchase since a Co-worker of my girlfriend uses this product and has had positive results.  I researched the ingredients and believe this is a good combination to stimulate the scalp &amp; hair follicles.  I have been happy with the volume and thickness it gives my hair. I have used drug store brands that claim to do the same but this actually leaves my scalp and hair feeling clean and thicker. My hair is thin so the additional volume definitely makes noticeable difference. I also use conditioner every day as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump makes it easy to use and it has a pleasant citrus aroma.</li>
    <li> I recently had bariatric weight loss surgery and one of the side effects is hair loss. I have been using this shampoo for 2 weeks now and am already noticing a difference. My hair has stopped breaking and I can see new growth (about 1/2&amp;#34;). The fragrance is awesome! Slightly minty is the way I can best describe it. It&#x27;s a very thick shampoo, almost gel-like and you seriously don&#x27;t have to use alot. Maybe dime-sized amount (I have short hair). It lathers well and rinses squeaky clean. I also have very oily hair and it seems to help cut down on the oil so I don&#x27;t have to wash every day. I have tried other hair-strengthening/hair growth shampoos and this one wins hands-down! My hair also is much shinier and &amp;#34;bouncy&amp;#34;. Well worth the price (and it&#x27;ll last a long time due to the small amount you need to use).</li>
    <li> Great product it really helps your hair grow and mosturizes in the process. I will be buying more in the near future.</li>
    <li> First off, just as a shampoo the smell and lather to it is really nice. And then as for the Hair Growth aspect, I am so glad I went for it and got this product!! It&#x27;s been a month of consistent use and I can already feel a difference as my hair has started coming in - and like other people said, it is definitely thicker and fuller than before too! I would definitely recommend this shampoo if you have thinning hair or are looking to gain some volume. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I can definitely say that this product works. I have had trouble with shampoos either leaving my scalp dry or my hair super dry. This product did the opposite. Not only did it help my hair feel softer and alive, it also helped my scalp. I have curly hair and it works extremely well on it. It works better than my normal shampoo. This shampoo has seemed to make my hair softer and I&#x27;ve noticed it has helped my scalp as well. Both my hair and scalp feel more moisturized and there is definitely less breakage. My hair is starting to feel fuller and there is more growth too!</li>
    <li> This is Amazing ... i could feel results in first wash itself.. there is a bounce in my hair which i love soo much !!&lt;br /&gt;Just waiting to use it more and see my hair bouncing all the time,,,totally loved it !!!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different shampoos that promoted hair regrowth before trying this one. I have seen by far the best results with this product. I followed the instructions exactly as it says on the bottle (it states to use  times a week and leave it in for 2 minutes) and within a couple weeks I began seeing results. My wife also noticed my hair was thicker and had more volume. I was very happy with this shampoo and am still using it</li>
    <li> This product shipped to me super fast! I was very excited to use this product because I&#x27;ve been steadily losing hair. I used this product a few times and can tell that my hair has reduced the amount of shedding and has become more full. It feels gentle on your scalp and after the shower leaves your hair very soft and smelling clean. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I washed my hair with this shampoo twice a day for more than 3 months. Guess what? I lost more hair than I was losing before.&lt;br /&gt;I can only guess that all the 5 stars reviews are fake. Never buy it again. If you want to lose hair buy it.</li>
    <li> Great product , although it is not going to cure all and it is not going to grow hair overnight, you will see a change in thickness and regrowth. For the price point, this is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman in my 20s and I&#x27;ve always had fine hair . As of late it was looking finer than usual. I&#x27;m sure my history or color treatments, curling, and straightener use played a role. In any case I needed to find a product that would bring my hair back to health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of polarizing reviews on this product and that made me nervous. The price tag made me even more hesitant to buy it because honestly, I&#x27;ve never spent more than $15 on any hair product. BUT, I was starting to get little frustrated with my hair health and I decided to give it a shot. I figured SOME of the positive reviews must be genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I started using the shampoo, not the recommended 5 times a week but more like every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: Shinier, thicker, definitely HEALTHIER looking hair. I&#x27;m not sure about &amp;#34;hair regrowth&amp;#34; but my hair is definitely looking thicker. Whether its new hair or just healthier overall hair I&#x27;m not sure. Whatever it is I am EXTREMELY happy with it. I haven&#x27;t had hair this pretty since I was in middle school. This product works, and I&#x27;m looking forward to see what happens with continued use. Again, I only use it every other day because I don&#x27;t believe you should wash your hair daily. It still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I only wish the bottle was bigger or the price a little lower. That is honestly my only complaint. The company should take note, because right now many people may not be buying this because of price when it really is a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind shelling out an extra cash for results, then I&#x27;d definitely recommend this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have noticed a bit of tingling after washes, but it always goes away as my hair dries out. Might be the product working on the scalp.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Was experiencing some thinning and after a couple weeks of using this I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I was worried it would make my hair smell weird but that&#x27;s not the case at all. If you give this product some time you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I decided to use this product alongside the conditioner which I recently purchased. Each shampoo, I use a quarter size amount and it seems appropriate for my short and color treated hair. I feel that the minty coolness of the product is great, as it makes my scalp tingle. While I am not losing hair, I enjoy the texture of my hair when I use this shampoo, especially when head and shoulders can make hair feel dry and brittle after rinsing. I think that by using the shampoo and conditioner together can really bring your hair to the highest potential. Overall, awesome product, as it makes the hair glossy, shiny, and full with minimal effort.</li>
    <li> Love the product i would suggest  it for my friends  and family  anytime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product! It really works! I&#x27;ve been using it and it has stopped my hair loss since I delivered my baby. I lost a tremendous amount of hair with my pregnancy and this product really works, i&#x27;m amazed! It&#x27;s very easy to use and the key is to use as much as you can to have great results.</li>
    <li> I am impressed; I just ordered this product the day before yesterday and it already arrived first thing in the morning. My hairstylist mentioned that I should try a product like this to help stimulate regrowth of hair and strength existing hair in areas that were not as full as I would have liked. This is the first time i&#x27;ve tried a stimulating surge shampoo and the results are good so far. First use was last night and I will admit that the shampoo smell is lacking the product acted as the label said it would with a tingling sensation on my scalp and afterwards when I was blowdrying my hair it did seem like my hair felt stronger. I could see how after using this shampoo on a regular basis it would be effective.</li>
    <li> Wow is this a great shampoo! You can actually feel it working... The smell is divine, and the sensation of the lather and tingling of your scalp are an experience in itself. As we all know aging has its effects, but this shampoo can help us fight back because honestly I feel my hair is now becoming thicker, stronger and I notice new growth as well. If you have thinning or stressed hair, try this, you will like it!</li>
    <li> This Ultrax Labs Caffeine shampoo is magnificent! I&#x27;ve been using it 4 times a week (even though the instructions advise 5 times), and after two weeks I noticed less shedding and some new growth in my thinner spots!  Plus the Ketoconazole ingredient in it helped with my itchy scalp/dandruff problems as well.  Also it gives your hair this luscious texture and a healthy strong feel.  I know now from my own success that Ultra Labs is one of the best hair loss shampoo&#x27;s out on the market now.</li>
    <li> My Hair is still falling, and makes my scalp very oily! My hair looks lifeless! I won&#x27;t buy this product again! It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and haven&#x27;t used it that long yet, but it seems to be doing a good job of gentle shampooing and helping to restore a healthier texture on my damaged color treated hair. Hair damaged from many years of color, and this was one reason I was hesitant to use a new product due to a possible reaction to the color. I researched the ingredients thoroughly and in fact caffeine seems to be a very common ingredient in products intended to revitalize hair, or help replenish hair loss through fall out (not my problem at all, but rather re-texturizing hair damaged due to years of coloring). The scent is a bit antiseptic/minty due to the menthol and peppermint oil in the treatment. Product also contains niacin (also good for healthy nails), panthenol(s) and saw palmetto, all known ingredients in hair revitalization formulas, as well as something called ketoconazole, which in my research seemed to be a frequent suggestion in hair loss forums as something that actively promotes hair growth. Whether you&#x27;re trying to bring back a healthy texture to your hair, or wanting to try a new hair regrowth product, this one seems to be a good bet.</li>
    <li> This is pure snake oil! Ok so a little background information. I am not seriously balding but starting to thin, at the crown. Im 39 and it just started in the past year, thinning hair and smaller thinner hair follicles. So I started with Nizoral and though because this has more of the active ingredient ketoconazole 1% versus 2% in Hair surge, it would truly help. Oh it certainly did not! This product and the active ingredient ketoconazole does nothing for thinning hair! Total snake oil! I have a dermatologist appointment now, and will probably start taking Rogaine and or propecia, before I start to go bald. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk! I thought great idea, a natural non chemical solution but there is no such thing! Genetics for those of us loosing hair is against us, so unless gene therapy is around the corner, Rogaine and Propecia are the only choices. I think for me Rogaine will be my option as Propecia comes with too many side effects, who the heck wants a full head of hair a noodle dick? Not me!</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s not your typical perfume, lathery foam goodness most other shampoos, thats not what this is for. This is to improve the quality of thinning hair. Sucks to say but that&#x27;s what I have and that&#x27;s why I got this. After a week of using it (5x in that week, as recommended), the spots I felt were fading seem to be doing better already. I don&#x27;t have a caffeine allergy or anything like that so it didn&#x27;t affect me. I will continue using this until further notice, but needless to say after only a week I&#x27;m a satisfied customer. If I don&#x27;t see anymore improvements by the time I&#x27;m done with the bottle, I&#x27;ll surely update this. But if these improvements continue as they have in just one week, I may have to get another bottle when I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> Although slightly skeptic at first, this product is wonderful. It thickens as promised and leaves your hair feeling clean, but not dry in the least. I paired it with a natural conditioner and I think it even worked wonders to bring out more of the highlights in my hair. Love this stuff, it is great to thicken and add shine!</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says.  I was skeptical at first , but after a few uses I noticed a difference in my hair, it has begun to grow back fairly fast and I love the smell and lather of this product.</li>
    <li> Well it works.  I have new hair growth after using 1 entire bottle... so far those new hairs (which are through out my scalp) are around 4 inches long (I do have long hair for a guy). My stylist said as long as it doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp (due to sensitivity) then keep using it.  For the price you CAN NOT beat it.  But just like any product it may not work for everyone but it did work for me.  Buying my second bottle today.</li>
    <li> Delightful to use. Leaves your hair feeling clean with a light lemon like smell that I love. After just a few uses I noticed my hair transforming. My hair looks great and I am shedding so much less now. I am having hair growth in spots that have been balding for years. This is a definite must have and use. My hair is in the best shape it has been in for years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out long for quite sometime.. and it had seemed to hit a dead end. Even with trimming my hair frequently. Then I started looking online and found this little bottle of miracles! ha. seriously though, one bottle and my hair already looking healthier, thicker and has even grown a little! I cant say enough good things about this shampoo. I cant wait to buy my next bottle! Only a few more inches and my hair will be at my waist line! :D Definitely give this stuff a go.</li>
    <li> It really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax Labs shampoo is one of the better hair loss treatments. The product works great and I have started to see results. I was skeptical for I tried other growth stimulant shampoos and had no luck. My hair has begun to grow back and I the product smells great. When applied it feels like it&#x27;s working and tingles. I guess the caffeine is working and would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> The worst Shampoo I ever bought. It made my hair fall out even faster. I never had a hair problem just wanted to get more volume. But now using this shampoo I have a hair problem. It made my hair fell out. Don&#x27;t buy this if you still care for your hair</li>
    <li> This has been great! I started losing hair at 19, and right away tried Rogaine and Propecia. They worked -- for about 5 years, and then I started losing hair again.... I tried saw palmetto, but that didn&#x27;t work, and then every folk remedy from rubbing garlic on my scalp to doing headstands, all to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 months of using this, I&#x27;m already starting to see some great regrowth on my crown and temples. The price is a bit high, but not compared to a hair transplant! As an added bonus, it has Ketoconazole in it, which has totally knocked out my mild, but persistent, dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been four years since I&#x27;ve grown my hair out beyond a crew cut, but with all of the help that this shampoo has given me, I&#x27;m excited to go back to my barber next week and finally try changing the style into something a little more fluffy and less bald!</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old, and have thin hair that seems to have inhibited growth.  I have been taking occassional BIOTIN vitamin supplements, but no real results, but this my hair was instantly rejuvenated after 1 wash.  It stimulated my scalp and even after 3 days, I am have no shedding. It;s a simple one step process, with no chemical smell.  As I have new hair growth the result will be thicker hair, as my existing hair even feels a bit thicker in just days. I will keep using this product weekly and put a follow-up review to further substantiate the results of my shampoo treatments</li>
    <li> I have less hair loss. It doesn&#x27;t lather or cover all hair unless you mix it with a bit of other shampoo or use TONS. But it does its job and will buy more.</li>
    <li> did not see any difference, too disappointed I just don&#x27;t get why it has good reviews when it&#x27;s not good anyway....</li>
    <li> Buyer beware... this is an 8 fluid ounce bottle. 8 fluid ounces! That is less than half the size of your typical bottle of water. For all the claims this product makes, this is so ridiculously expensive. If you wash your hair once per day and use an \\&quot;average\\&quot; amount of this product, this is easily less than a one month supply. I have not encountered any shampoo on the market that is near this expensive per fluid ounce. For the annual cost of using this product in tandem with the conditioner, I am much better putting it towards professional hair restoration.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after experiencing some hair loss due to thyroid problems. I started taking biotin and evening primose oil that slowed/stopped the hair from falling out, but I was at a loss on what to do to help stimulate it to grow back. I had read other reviews and decided to try it out. It&#x27;s not an overnight process, hair growth takes time as we all know. But I could definitely see fine hairs sprouting up along my hair line within the first two weeks and I could feel a lift with my hair overall. The smell is pleasant (definitely a caffeine smell, like an energy drink but in a good way). It lasts a lot longer than I thought it would too considering the size of the bottle, you only need a small amount to get a good lather, so you don&#x27;t have to squeeze a whole lot on (I have just below shoulder length fine hair though so it depends on your own hair volume and length). At any rate I am pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to others who have the same problems.</li>
    <li> As I’ve gotten older my hair has thinned out and doesn’t grow as fast and long as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo brings back some of that youthful thickness and volume lost from age, stress and over processing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light in your hair and on your scalp. It is easy to rinse out which is great. I don’t like having to sit there rinsing over and over to get the suds out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could use a bigger bottle but, it’s a small price to pay to get my hair shiny and thick again.</li>
    <li> I would definitely buy again.well worth the money..hair looks and feels so much better</li>
    <li> This shampoo might be a little pricey but it was well worth the money. Great smell, good ingredients, does the job of a shampoo and goes beyond. Would use in combination with an even better conditioner. Although the washing directions are mor of a guideline rather than required to get the desired result. Don&#x27;t overuse and you will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I am usually very wary of &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products, but this one really delivers! I have been using it for about a month now and definitely see marked results.  As soon as I started using this shampoo, I noticed that my hair was generally fuller and more voluminous.  Also, even my normal daily shedding was immediately lessened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about two weeks, I noticed that my hair started growing again.  I have very long hair so it has pretty much stopped growing.  But now it seems to be getting longer again.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and I am noticing that I actually have more hair.  It&#x27;s more than just having fuller or thicker hair (although this has happened as well); I can see new baby hairs growing in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use this product, you get a tingly feeling on your scalp.  But it&#x27;s a good feeling, like a free scalp massage (which, by the way, feels AMAZING!).  And that tingly feeling lets you know that it&#x27;s working.  It lets you know that Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth shampoo does what it says it does.  The name is quite long, but it matches the number of benefits you get when you use it! So if you want thicker, fuller, longer hair, and more of it, AND a free scalp massage, get this stuff! I promise you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first that this shampoo would actually work for me, but I didn&#x27;t have anything to worry about.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and can already see results. My hair is thicker, stronger and smells great too.  I definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone with thinning hair or hair that sheds easily.  I hope it works for you too!</li>
    <li> Ultrax is the first shampoo and conditioner product combo that I&#x27;ve found actually reduces hair loss. When I shampoo and condition, I find fewer hairs than I&#x27;ve seen in 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair is clean, shiny and easy to manage. The formula for the conditioner is absolutely amazing, as I don&#x27;t need a lot of other product to get a style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product........ no question</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and also great making my stronger, fuller and thicker! The shine is awesome and my hair is more manageable too!I could really feel the difference!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now and I love it. I use it everyday. I have definitely seen a stop to my shedding. Before I started using it, I was shedding like a dog, but now, hardly any.  I also like the fact it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, so my need for conditioner is minimal. Unlike a lot of other specialty shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell. It&#x27;s not a fruity or sweet smell, but the smells not bad, so I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, and though there was potential for leakage the way it was shipped, the bottle is a good build, and it was fine.  Would highly recommend this product to any one who is looking to stop their shedding.</li>
    <li> Product worked great, I had never tried it before and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but saw such a huge difference using the ultrax supplements, I thought I would try the shampoo. Pleasantly surprised! The caffeine in this product helps with the scalp and you feel a exfoliating process which I think helps with the growth. I have been using this product a week and I have not experienced hair shedding nor a handful of hair in the drain. Would definitely recommend. Don&#x27;t expect a lot of lathering as this product is more of a treatment shampoo. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> As a mommy of 2 who breastfed for greater than a year with each, I had my fair share of thinning hair. Post pregnancy, my fear was to loose hair, but it was inevitable. 3 months after the birth of my baby, my hair started to shed in the handfuls with each shower. While, I never give in to &amp;#34;quick fixes,&amp;#34; I was desperate to try something to cut down on the hair loss. Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Shampoo intrigued me and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a fair shot. After using this product for almost a month, the amount of hair that is loss with each shower has greatly declined. I can run my fingers through my hair and finger comb my hair, without seeing strands of hair in my hand. There is much more vibrance to my hair and managability with use of Ultrax, which in my case, is usually obtained with rotating several shampoos. The smell of the shampoo is very invigorating, smells almost of tea tree oil. My only complaint is that this shampoo does not produce a foaming lather, however, using 4-5 pumps is ample to shampoo my hair. Otherwise, this product is a keeper, I already ordered my next bottle!</li>
    <li> Great for dry scalp and hair that lacks fullness! Ive been using this for a few weeks now, definitely my go to every day shampoo. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months but waiting to write a review until i was sure it wasn&#x27;t just a coincidence... and its not. ive had slight issues with thinning hair and it wasnt growing like it used to when i was a teenager. Since using this product my hair is thicker/fuller, softer, shinier, and it has grown faster. I am so happy with this product. who knew caffeine could stimulate more than just your soda cravings!! This shampoo is salon quality... with visible results.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo along with the Ultrax Hair Rush supplements about a month ago, on the recommendation of a friend. Not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or the supplement, or the combination of the two, but I have definitely noticed a substantial decrease in the amount of hair clogging up my shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been dealing with an abnormal amount of hair loss after having a major surgery a year ago. I&#x27;m not sure what caused it, but I suspect the shock my body experienced combined with stress and a lack of nutrients needed to replenish my hair. I had reached a point where I was ready to try anything to stop the shedding. This shampoo is doing the trick! It doesn&#x27;t really lather like a regular shampoo, so I treat it as a serum - start at my scalp and work it through the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve still got the bottle my friend gave me, but will definitely order more once I run out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo comes in a bottle that makes it easy to dispense. The scent of the shampoo is not very strong which in my opinion is how it should be for a shampoo. The scent smelled faintly of citrus. It was just enough to notice it and defiantly doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent.  I applied it to my hair and noticed a little bit of this shampoo is enough to wash a full head of hair. My hairs volume appears that it has increased, but would like to use this for a few months to see the results over a longer period. I have a receding hairline and hope that after the first few uses that this product will help me disguise my hair loss. I know for sure this shampoo adds volume to my hair, and I hope that it can prevent future hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for sometime now and I am glad I bought this product. I have stopped losing my hair every time I take a shower or comb it. The smell is pleasant and it does not leave your hair dry. My wife says that my receding hairline looks better and that it seems like I have better hair growth. I love my hair and this product is worth the money to keep it looking good.</li>
    <li> I saw the YT videos and decided to try this on my hair.  My hair feels fuller and thicker and I can tell the difference.  It is not weighted down and i barely had to put any product in my hair to keep it tame just a good leave in conditioner.  Great find.</li>
    <li> After using this shampoo for several weeks I have noticed a difference in hair shedding.  My hair feels healthier and looks denser.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how much better my hair will look after further use!</li>
    <li> Using this product is simply and the results are fabulous! I loved it so much that I brought another one for me And my friend. He loved it very much. He says that his roots are touchable when he waves his hand through his hair. I appreciate this product so much and you&#x27;ll love it or whoever you buy it for a gift! Good luck!</li>
    <li> So thrilled with this product.  This shampoo has restored my hair after years of dealing with thinning.  I was almost ready to shave it all off, but after a few uses I noticed those thin spots beginning to disappear.  Glad I found this!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Not very sure whether it protects the hair loss but it is very gentle on hair. But given the cost one may want to think twice before ordering it</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!!!!! I have thinning around my hair line. It&#x27;s quit normal for me because this has always been a issue for me. This product instantly makes your hair and scalp feel healthy. Works wonders for those with itchy scalp. This product has definitely gave my hairline New life!!</li>
    <li> Even though this shampoo is a little pricey sometimes its worth paying for what you get. I have thicker hair but still wanted to try this product and I have noticed a difference in the texture and health of my hair. My hair is very soft after using this and I didn&#x27;t even use a conditioner after. For any one that has thinning hair I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday but I also combine a few drops with my homemade \\&quot;scalp leave in conditioner\\&quot; during my non-shampoo days. My scalp conditioner is made of a few drops of the shampoo, combine with Braggs organic olive oil, jojoba oil , lavender and rosemary oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen is: shampoo every other day, and \\&quot;scalp leave in conditioner\\&quot; during other days -I also follow with a hair rinse with Braggs organic vinegar for two minutes... Harsh smell tho. On the plus side, I have already noticed a huge difference using Ultrax Labs shampoo than any other brand - I feel like it&#x27;s the caffeine that makes a difference. I&#x27;m not sure exactly which ingredient it is but what I&#x27;ve experience with other brands and none of them even come close to the results like Ultrax Labs shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks I&#x27;ve noticed nothing but shiny, thicker bouncy curls. Of course I no longer blowdry or flat iron my hair, instead Ive been using hot rollers. And everyday whether it&#x27;s shampoo or my scalp treatment I massage my scalp for five minutes a full five minutes as I&#x27;m applying.  I also take an over the counter vitamin b, and Biotin- along with tons of iron. I&#x27;m anemic so I take Pure Absorb twice a day with OJ. I did trimmed my ends by half an inch before starting this. Today,  my hair is healthier than before and feels much stronger, no more shedding.. Yay!! This product is amazing!! As I&#x27;m brushing I have noticed no more hair shedding on my hair brush. I can&#x27;t wait for another week to go by so I can flat iron and measure my new growth. I know it&#x27;s working because my roots are already showing and it hasn&#x27;t been a month yet. This is the best hair growth shampoo that I can trust and recommend for anyone who is seeking a hair growth shampoo. For a product that delivers what it promises, it&#x27;s worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I must say that I am remarkably impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve been dealing with baby fine hair my entire life. It seemed like nothing would give me the full, thick locks I had always wanted. I came across this product in a moment of desperation and I was not disappointed. Not only is my hair fuller and thicker than ever after a month of use, but my hair is so soft and shiny I almost feel like one of those women on the shampoo commercials. I would highly recommend this product for anyone with baby fine or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff really brought my thin hair back to life.  Its pricey but I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else now that I&#x27;ve tried this.  I saw results right away.  My hair is thicker and softer and growing great.  I am so happy I found this!</li>
    <li> First off, I love the way this shampoo smells.  Its really fresh and nice.&lt;br /&gt;You dont have to use a lot of it for it to work, too.  I have really long hair and thought at first when I pumped it out of the bottle that it was going to take a ton of it, but turns out a little goes a pretty long way.  It doesnt lather up real big, so dont get confused or think you arent using enough.  Its less like conventional shampoo and almost more like serum.  The packaging/pump bottle is nice too. Doesnt spill.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair and hair loss, Ive been using this shampoo for a week and have already noticed a difference.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, for quick results. Hair gets noticeably longer quite quickly, improvement in hair texture and thickness. Easy to use, for the results you get! I&#x27;d recommend this for product for hair loss.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! My edges were badly thinning from keeping my hair in ponytails. Not only are my edges growing, all my hair is noticeably thicker. I love the fullness that I was able to get from using this shampoo. I noticed results after only two washes and as I continued to use it, my hair kept getting stronger. Most shampoos strip my hair but I was able to retain moisture and keep my hair soft. I use the shampoo at least three times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo latters well without overdoing it and rinses out well. There is no need to use a lot for each wash, so the bottle lasts a long time. Ultrax Labs products have helped me with the regrowth of my hair. This shampoo is different from anything found and the stores and best all, it lives up to what it says.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good because I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and I can already feel the difference. I really like the sensation you get when you use it too. Not only does it make your hair feel really clean, but you do get the feeling of more body and thickness in your hair. I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using it because it&#x27;s working out so well. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 30 days of use.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a simple shampoo for growth, look no further! Ultrax seems to be doing the trick, I think I&#x27;ve found my new permanent shampoo.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago and I&#x27;m so impressed with the results! I noticed my hair slowly growing thicker and doesn&#x27;t shed as much. You can see the softened texture which made my hair looked healthy and vibrant. I recommended Ultrax Labs Hair Surge to anyone experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> I freaked out when I noticed I was loosing my hair since my dad is bald and my older brother has lost most of his and I&#x27;m only 28 years young, I went on Amazon looking for a slucion I bought an organic shampoo, great smell and my hair was really soft but after a couple months I was still losing a bunch of hair. I kept looking and found this shampoo which had some good reviews, I was a little skeptical but I had to try it. No lie, it&#x27;s been two weeks and I have a bunch of new baby hair, I love it, I think I won&#x27;t have to shave or wear a hat or any of that. I&#x27;ll keep using it. I&#x27;m also taking the HAIR MAXX pills that might be helping too</li>
    <li> This shampoo is beyond amazing!! Works after 2 washes. My hair feel thicker, fuller and more luxurious! The smell is great! And I don&#x27;t understand why all shampoo bottles aren&#x27;t pump bottles. It&#x27;s so convenient! I highly recommend this product to anyone not feeling confident about their hair thickness. You wont regret it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help stop the receding hair line on the front top of my head. I finally found a product that actually delivers the promise. In two weeks, I noticed hair growth. I will continue to use this product daily. I would recommend this to everyone who has been dealing with hair loss and needs something that will actually provide benefits!</li>
    <li> My hair changes depending on the weather from oily to brittle. I tried this formula for 5 days and a massive change for the better. It brought life back into my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not saying that this product doesn&#x27;t work. However, I haven&#x27;t seen any results as of yet. It has only been two and a half weeks since i started using it.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with shedding (and I have long hair - so the shedding was freaking me out!)  This shampoo definitely cuts down on the amount of hair shed!  My theory is that my hair looks fuller because I am losing fewer hairs every day.  My hair looked better (in terms of condition, shine) after one use, and I noticed fewer shed hairs after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I was sooo tired of hiding my hair loss, but thanks to SURGE those days are over. I am a 36 year old professional business man who started losing my hair early in life and now Surge has me feeling like I am reclaiming my manhood. I was so embarrassed always having to wear hats and what I really hated was looking at my work portrait attached to my office email...ugh! THANKS to Surge those days are over. Also nothing is easier than shampooing. For me perfect solution, low effort and maximum results!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Dad, he has some hair loss and dryness going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He used it for a week and he hasn&#x27;t notice any drastic change, which is understandble (1 week of use), but he did notice that he wasn&#x27;t losing hair as much when combing his hair. He also noticed that his hair is a little more softer and is no longer dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post an update after a couple more weeks of use, but so far it seems to be working for my dad.</li>
    <li> I ordered Ultrax Labs Hair Surge because in the past few years I have had a lot of hair loss due to a medical condition. The medical condition is now under control, but my hair hasn&#x27;t returned to normal at all. I have been trying so many different products and shampoos and I haven&#x27;t had success with any of the hair loss shampoos that I have tried. When I received my package I started using Hair Surge that first night. I love the refreshing scent of the shampoo but what I really love is the cool, tingling feeling in my scalp. I leave the shampoo in my hair for the full 5 minutes and I can tell that it is penetrating my scalp and getting to my hair follicles. In the past week, I already notices less shedding which is a major thing for me. My hair was always shedding and it definitely has slowed down a lot already. I also love that this is a regular shampoo and you can use it 5 times per week for optimal results. I really don&#x27;t need something that is a time consuming process. Hair Surge is not a cheap shampoo, but in this case you get what you pay for. It is worth every penny and I will continue to use it each time I shampoo my hair.</li>
    <li> Seems like a lot of these reviews are fakes; made by people who have only reviewed Ultrax labs products. If you look at my review history you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;ve reviewed multiple products on Amazon and I have no incentive to BS a review.  Anyway, after having little success with hair loss products since Nioxin started making worse stuff after they got bought out by Procter and Gamble, I&#x27;ve been desperate to find a replacement to help with my MPB.  I tried Bosley shampoo &amp; conditioners with minimal success; and had almost given up hope when I saw these Ultrax Labs products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the big red flag of possible fake reviews left me initially skeptical, but since I&#x27;ve been desperate to find a good hair loss shampoo &amp; conditioner I decided to try them out once and see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well after about a month now of using the shampoo, conditioner, and supplement pills I can say that I&#x27;m truly impressed.  My hair is definitely thicker and I&#x27;m not receding as much as I was.  This stuff is better then the Bosley stuff, much better then the new Nioxin formulations and about on par with the old Nioxin formulas.  Too bad for the most-likely fake reviews; because they almost made me not buy the product.  In the end though I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the prices are definitely high for a shampoo &amp; conditioner (and the pills, sheesh) but the system does perform for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the pump on the shampoo sucks - I like the regular type dispenser on the conditioner much better.</li>
    <li> okay, so this stuff isnt going to make you hair smell like magic and glow like heaven, but if you need to thicken and grow hair, this is the product for you! I struggled with hair loss after getting a brazilian blow out...terrible decision...none the less this product is the only one that actually helped my hair get thick and luscious again. I have tried many things but this stuff does the trick</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is on a mission to  keep his hair.  He is eating like a health nut , taking supplements and now he&#x27;s asking about a nourishing shampoo for me to find.  Therefore, I did my research and found this product and suggest that he give it a try..  Days later, I must say, his hair appeared to have more volume and he can&#x27;t seem to avoid a mirror.  He is extremely pleased with the shampoo and now I&#x27;m on a mission to try it.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my hair short and have been looking for a shampoo that helps give my hair a fuller look and this has sure helped! Not only has it made it fuller, but it has made my hair so smooth. The thing I really like about this is you can feel it working while washing it! It&#x27;s called surge for a reason, I almost feel a surge going into my hair, it&#x27;s a nice cool feeling, I feel like I am getting pampering every time I was my hair. The one thing (and this is a personal preference) is that it&#x27;s thick so it took some lathering to rub around my hair, but it is nice that it&#x27;s thick so you don&#x27;t have to use too much as well though.</li>
    <li> I like this product it has a nice scent and it is something I would enjoy to shampoo everyday.  The top has a push down spout and easy to use.  It took only a week to get to me.  I dnt know the results yet because I just recieved it.  I am sure this brand can help with the thinning of my hair because it has caffeine in it and that should mean it should be a great product.  I am going to use this right away.</li>
    <li> It works great. Ive had this product for about a week almost two and i see results already. The product doesn&#x27;t have a weird chemical smell, it smells great :) My hair was thinned out from having children and now i can feel my hair gaining body to it and thickness. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great product cant wait to receive. I love the ingredients.This product is probably the best on the market.If you are looking for a hair product for hair growth pull the trigger on this immediately.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love.  This shampoo smells great.  My daughter has had thin edges for yearssss and this shampoo seems to be making a difference there.  Only complaint ....it doesn&#x27;t lathe well. We use another shampoo first, follow by this one and it lathes better.  Will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> Works great. Can see why it&#x27;s top-rated. At the very least seems to stop hair loss, if not begin the process of regrowing it. Seems to give a burst of energy to the scalp with every use. One of the best hair loss products without major side effects.</li>
    <li> Recently my hair has been changing it&#x27;s texture. A friend mentioned this product to me so I decided to check it out. After just a few uses I noticed my hair becoming thicker and fuller. I was extremely impressed about how quickly I noticed a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> While some products like this have a medicine-like stench, this one actually smells like normal shampoo. Results incredibly satisfactory and quickly without dandruff</li>
    <li> Seems to have at least slowed the rate of thinning.  4 stars based on the short term effects, but will review again after several months.</li>
    <li> My hair is shinny, fuller, AND breaking less in the shower! my thin hair now has more volume (because it&#x27;s not falling out).  I look forward to what it will look like by the end of the summer!</li>
    <li> This product works great for my thin, fine curly hair! Unlike other shampoos for hair loss, it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh chemical smell and doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp, leaving my hair feeling dry and brittle. The label is also discreet and looks like an upscale boutique shampoo as opposed to a chemical formula for hair loss, making me feel more comfortable about leaving it in the shower when having guests.</li>
    <li> Due to  strenuous hair stylea I&#x27;ve suffered thinning hair along my hair line. As a woman that can be discouraging. I&#x27;ve tried different products but after using this shampoo I&#x27;ve noticed changes in the texture if my hair. I look forward to seeing more results.</li>
    <li> I got a short haircut about a year ago and ive been struggling to regrow my hair like some of the other reviews ive tried various other products I saw this one and decided to give it a try and after about a month I noticed it was thicker and fuller! Its finally grelowing consistently I definitely recommend this shampoo!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with shedding since my hair gets VERY frizzy and dry, especially in the summer when I&#x27;m sweating and therefore shampooing constantly. After only a week of using the Ultrax shampoo, my hair feels SO much fuller, and I hardly lose any hair when I&#x27;m showering. I usually comb out so much hair each morning and night, but this shampoo already has my hair feeling so much stronger and thicker. I also have noticed that, after only a few days of use, the thinner patch of hair that I have near my part is already filling out.  What I also love about this product is that it has essential oils, so it feels like I&#x27;m using something natural rather than harsh chemicals.  You do have to use quite a bit for a good lather, but the results make it TOTALLY worth the consumption rate and price. Definitely get this product! Works like magic.</li>
    <li> originally I bought this for my father who&#x27;s 42 and hair keeps thinning and keeps falling. This really helped him. For the price this its not too bad. This is really worth getting!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I am 50 yrs old and for the last few years, my hair was getting so thin and weak.  When I was young, I had such healthy thick hair, so when I started to lose it, it was scary.  I&#x27;ve notice a lot less hair loss in my brush and, my ;hair feels stronger.  Also, this shampoo leaves your hair feeling soft and looking  shinier.  It is a good quality product and it does what it claims to do.  Quality shampoos are expensive, and this is no exception, but for thicker and stronger hair, it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have strong hair already, use this to keep up on it. Wish it had a fruity smell to it.</li>
    <li> Product works better than advertised ! Im seeing results quicker that I could have ever imagined with any other shampoo product.</li>
    <li> After trying multiple shampoos I have found what I think is one of the best hair products out there. My hair looks and feels fuller without feeling weighed down after only a few uses. My hair is thin in front so the additional volume definitely makes a big difference. Also I&#x27;ve noticed that my daily hair loss has gone down dramatically.  I love it, my wife loves it and I highly recommend this product. Definitely worth the every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year. This shampoo did not make any difference in my hair growth, texture, or thickness. But it has one effect that encourages me to buy it, which is making my hairs look like denser even after the first use. If this effect is not good enough to spend about $44, I recommend to look for other hair products.</li>
    <li> I  saw  a difference  the 1st time I used it ,  The  3rd  time  I used this my hair looked thicker .  My friends saw me and they said  wow my hair looks great &amp;  I&#x27;m  losing less hair ..</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband about a month ago, and I can see results already. I will recommend this product to anyone experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> Diggin&#x27; this product. I have not been using it long, but am already noticing less of my hair clinging on to my clothes for dear life. I&#x27;ll update in a while to complete my review. Thanks for the full head of hair!</li>
    <li> this shampoo has a really nice scent, I expected it to smell like harsh chemicals or medicine but it did not. i have used this just a handful of times and I already notice a difference (thank god). i have used just about everything available to get my hair to grow and this has been the only thing that has shown a major improvement in a short amount of time. This shampoo has made my hair feel and look full,my hair used to look limp and thin ,and it actually bounces when I walk  ( which has never happened before). Everyone will respond to this shampoo differently. I started noticing a difference almost immediately but with my mother waited a few weeks before she noticed a significant difference. my advice would be to stick with it!  this shampoo is expensive but worth the money.</li>
    <li> I am a 43 year old woman and up until my mid 30&#x27;s I had  long, thick hair. Then I began to have so much hair fall out and it was horrible. I tried every hair loss shampoo out there and nothing has worked as well as this. Today is exactly one month since I started using this shampoo. The main thing I have noticed is that there&#x27;s less hair falling out when I wash and brush it. I trimmed over half an inch of split ends and it has already grown back. I also have noticed lots of new little hairs sprouting on my head!  I will definitely buy this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I have lots of hair loss so I was excited to give this a try.  My previous condition was very embarrassing where I lightly grabbed a bunch of my hair and I then I would have a few strands that come out.  I would say I lost 100+ pieces of hair a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing the brown bottle and knowing there is caffeine in it, I was guessing the shampoo would smell like a coffee bean.  It probably has the opposite smell of that :)  It has a light peppermint or minty smell (like I said it’s very light so it’s not overpowering) that smells and feels refreshing.  After washing with it, I felt a slight tingling feeling for approximately half an hour.  It was not a strong feeling like I have felt while dying my hair, but instead it had the same sensation as my head feels after someone has massaged my scalp.  Like it has awakened my scalp but not a stronger sensation than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a week, my hair seems fuller especially at my roots.  I don’t have much hair where my hair parts and now it appears fuller after using the shampoo.  It is less noticeable that I don’t have too much hair where my hair parts than before.  I am also noticing less hair on the floor and in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is convenient because it has a pump.  No need to turn it upside down and wait for it to drip out.</li>
    <li> My hair is my crowning glory and when it started to thin and shed I decided to tackle the problem with a vengeance, sampling many hair products.  None have prove more effective than Ultralax Lab&#x27;s Hair Surge with Caffeine.  The shampoo contains key ingredients that have been scientifically proven to eliminate thinning and shedding of hair:  caffeine for a jump start on hair follicle health, the anti-inflammatory Ketoconazole, and Saw Palmetto which blocks an enzyme related to hair loss.  In less than a week I noticed improvement.  I high recommend this shampoo in the battle against hair loss.</li>
    <li> My roommate has had an early onset hair loss and shaves his hair. Out of curiosity, I got him to try this. Where he still can grow hair, it did seem to speed it up a little. It didn&#x27;t stimulate any hair growth where he had already lost it, but he said it would be worth his time if he was just thinning and not balding.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband.  He likes the smell and makes his hair fuller. But, for me the smell is a little too strong. Good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for at least 4 months, coming off another shampoo that contained  0.1% Ketoconazole.&lt;br /&gt;(BTW, 0.2% shampoo should require a perscription in the US, so if this falls off the market, that might be why ;))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wash my hair twice, once with this stuff, then again with baby shampoo, it looks slightly worse than it did a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;This implies it&#x27;s not doing all that much to save my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why wash it twice?  The product make your hair puff, which makes it look thicker.  I suspect this is why people think it &amp;#34;works fast&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all said,  the stuff does claim to have stuff that may possible do something for some people.  It also happens to be a decent shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to spend the coin on a hopeful potion, it might as well be this one.</li>
    <li> I have recently received this product, and WOW ! My hair has grown and gotten a lot thicker. The shampoo does exactly what it says it will do. The consistency is thick and a little goes a long way ! I was skeptical about buying this product at first and it not working but I am so glad I did get it. I will definitely continue to use this shampoo and recommend it to ANYONE looking to thicken and add length to their hair !!! By far the best I have came across !</li>
    <li> I am amazed with the results, in the time I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo not only stop my hair loss which was a big deal for me, but also my hair is stronger and longer, I recommend it completely</li>
    <li> Female pattern baldness runs in my family.  At 37, I am starting to notice the texture of my hair getting finer.  I thought I was destined to the outcome of my mother and grandmother....Now I have hope I can stop or at least delay the progression of it.  After 2 weeks I am not even noticing more fullness and body, but also new growth around my hairline!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has issues with hair loss or it runs in their family.</li>
    <li> Great, effective product</li>
    <li> A great product. The shampoo itself is thick and it creates a nice thick lather. Scalp feels great and hair is silky.</li>
    <li> I needed a shampoo that added thickness and make it look fuller, after using this product I can definitely see a difference in my hair.  I had places where you could see my flaky scalp and after using this product my hair is staring to cover it up more and my scalp has also seen improvements.  Its hard to find a product that really works to make hair fuller and also leaves hair shinny and I have noticed that a lot less of my hair is falling out.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for shinny er, thicker, and fuller hair. I will continue to use this product because of the results I have seen.</li>
    <li> This product will remove more hair than growth. The reviews must have been written by the company&#x27;s employees. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Very drying and just plain bad.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this bottle is expired or something but I can&#x27;t stand the bad foul smell. And it makes my scalp itch a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it</li>
    <li> Comes in a nice black bottle&lt;br /&gt;nice hard plastic, it also comes with a pump on top of the bottle to ensure you get the right amount of product to use!&lt;br /&gt;it has a pleasant citrus smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the shampoo so far I would recommend it anyone you hair loss problems!!</li>
    <li> Got the idea to get this amazing hair growth alternative from a friend who used it and I must say this product is worth every penny! With more hair comes more confidence and thanks to ultrax labs incredible shampoo formula for making that possible. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. I&#x27;m glad I got this shampoo because at age 58 my hair&#x27;s been thinning a lot at the crown area. I tried it as soon as I got it, and even though I&#x27;ve only washed my hair once with it, my scalp feels different (in a good way), like a tingly sensation. I have long, curly multiracial hair and all other shampoos weigh my hair down. Hair Surge didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and I didn&#x27;t lose a lot of hair like I always do, and my hair broke less while shampooing. My hair was also easier to comb through. I&#x27;m really pleased. If Hair Surge Shampoo has worked this well with just one washing, I can imagine how much better it&#x27;ll be after a week or more of shampooing with it! Oh, and just the aroma of the shampoo alone can perk you up.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo! My hair looks great after using it. I&#x27;m not sure if it is helping my hair grow, I&#x27;m only on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really does work and was very easy to use. I&#x27;ve had problems with hair loss for quite some time and this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve tried that actually worked and caused no irritation or effects. The price can&#x27;t be beat and it&#x27;s quality is impressive. I would definitely recommend it and plan on buying it again in the future. Shipping was fast and although the price may seem high, the overall value is totally worth it. Definitely recommend...</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great and does exactly what it&#x27;s advertising, without a medicated scent I may add. I&#x27;m not thinning per-say but I&#x27;ve noticed less hair in my shower just after the third time I used this shampoo. I&#x27;ve also noticed the increase in strength of my hair. I don&#x27;t have to spend extra time cleaning my brush. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who&#x27;s hair has thinned or is thinning.</li>
    <li> This product did not perform as promised--I realized no benefit. I would be spending my money on Progaine Volumizing Shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have only had this shampoo for a short time and in that time I can&#x27;t say I saw an improvement in thickness or length of my hair, but I did notice that my hair is shedding less! I expect my hair to grow more as I use it, but time will tell.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery upon ordering!  The smell of the shampoo is fresh and you can smell its energy. It lathered up well.  Haven&#x27;t used it for long, but my family is enjoying this product!  We all want to increase the thickness of our locks!</li>
    <li> My hair has been shedding for a few years now, since post pregnancy. I used this shampoo for a week, every day, and noticed that my shower drain has barely any hair in it. Also after brushing my hair, there were less and less shedding each day. It definitely slowed the thinning process. With such result after only a week, I believe my long hair will look fuller with every wash. Oh, and my hair appear to be a lot shinier as well.</li>
    <li> I am a 25 year old woman who has PCOS. I have been struggling with major hair loss issues over the past 3 years, especially after the birth of my now 18 month old daughter. I have tried many vitamins and supplements to no avail. One had helped get rid of these stupid hairs I get on my chin, but no results growing back on the hair on my head. I had actually ordered the Hair Maxx vitamins, and was sent this by accident? Well, it sat in my drawer for quite a while and I had totally forgotten to ship it back after the deadline, so I wound up keeping it. I started using it about 2 months ago, and holy crap has my hair grown back! At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, but it&#x27;s really obvious now. The baby hairs on the front of my hair line were all but gone, you could pretty much see my scalp. Now there is tons of new hair sprouting up there. The shampoo itself isn&#x27;t like a normal shampoo, its thick and almost sticky feeling. It rinses clean, though, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all. The bottle itself is small but it has last me quite a while, even having shoulder length hair. I am going to continue using this stuff and hope progress will continue, if it does, it will go from 4 to 5 stars. :)</li>
    <li> Used as directed daily.  No difference before and after.  This expensive shampoo does NOT work.  Waste of money.  Waste of time.</li>
    <li> I cannot imagine this hair product lasting a long time. It did not lather and it smelled &amp;#34;ugly&amp;#34; day after using it. I returned it and seller reimbursed me completely.</li>
    <li> My hair has stopped shedding and I am going to reorder soon.</li>
    <li> I think I have tried almost every well-known brand of hair growth shampoo. They have all failed me. Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo works great for hair growth. Also, it has prevented my postpartum hair shedding. I definitely recommend this product for anyone, men or women, who are experiencing hair-loss, hair-thinning or for anyone that would just like to grow their hair out. This shampoo is absolutely a winner. A great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> More than half the reviews come from individuals who have little to no other reviews or from individuals who have only rated Ultrax Lab&#x27;s products (all five stars). I find that shady and dishonest; safe to assume they come from individuals paid by the company. Take a look for yourself if you do not believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the shampoo itself. It contains ingredients which have been said to have positive effects, however. Having used half the bottle, this shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel great. I don&#x27;t like it and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and have really curly hair and have always loved long hair.  I&#x27;ve had a long pony tail going down my back for over 20 years and after noticing my hair thinning on top I reluctantly cut it all off and have been keeping it a very close crew cut ever since.  With me it&#x27;s all or nothing, and if I can&#x27;t have my long hair looking full and the way I like it then I don&#x27;t want any of it.  I didn&#x27;t want to go through all the snake oil salesmen that promise quick results and didn&#x27;t want to go through hair plugs and that route.&lt;br /&gt;  A friend of mine gave me this as a gift and I figured I can&#x27;t lose what&#x27;s already gone so I tried it according to the directions not thinking anything will happen but after following the directions that said to use at least 5 days a week (I actually decided to use it daily) I noticed soft hair appearing over parts of my forehead that were completely devoid of hair before.&lt;br /&gt;Amazed and surprised to say the least I&#x27;m continuing to use it with the hopes of maybe someday reclaiming my dark curly locks!&lt;br /&gt;  This is my second bottle and I was surprised that it had a hefty price that was well worth it.  I took my friend to a nice dinner and she told me she was starting to notice results on my head.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot and you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Took a little bit longer for my order to be processed but I am hoping it will be well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. From the first use I noticed it only took a very small, dime sized amount to lather my hair. When using Hair Surge the most amazing thing happened! My hair didnt shed while washing or blow drying, nearly as much as it would with my regular shampoo. It smells great, my hair is stronger, and fuller. I cant wait to see my progress after six weeks. Im ditching my other shampoo and sticking with Hair Surge.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this product! After suffering from thinning hair for years, and having tried everything I could find, including Minoxidil, I have actually seen noticeable results in a short time of using this shampoo.  I normally clean a very large amount of hair out of my drain after each shower, as well as constantly have to clean hairs off my bathroom floor, due to continual daily shedding.  In just two weeks, I noticed that there is far less hair to clean up each day.  I look forward to seeing my hair start to grow back in with continual use.  I also love the fresh, citrusy scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had thin hair issues and have tried several products claiming to thicken hair. Most don&#x27;t work well enough or not at all but Ultrax does work but not enough for my hair. I believe it depends on the hair type and severity of hair loss and since I&#x27;m not new to thinning it did little for my case. It does work great as a shampoo. It smells good, lathers up quick and thick and washes out flawlessly. I&#x27;d suggest this to those who are just starting to thin.</li>
    <li> HALLELUJAH! finally a hair growth product on the market that works! I can&#x27;t tell you guys how many things I have been trying on my poor fiance. From pills, to extensions, nothing seemed to be working. Finally, a friend recommended me this product after she had been using it for about a month and a half to grow out her hair (after a terrible haircut) and I must say... I didn&#x27;t expect these results! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I saw little baby hair follicles growing up after just about a week and a half. I visibly notice a reduction in my fiances balding. From up close and from far away his hair just looks way fuller than it used to. Today will make it exactly 3 and a half weeks since we purchased and started using this product and I already ordered him another! Our second bottle will be arriving just in time for this one to run out since he&#x27;s been using it pretty much every day of the week. He even brought it with him to the beach and starting panicking when he thought he lost it! haha, I can not say enough how much he loves this product. It really has changed our world!! Now, I recommend this to all my friends and have even bought our Uncle John and Grandpa a bottle. The lather is amazing, it smells amazing, it works amazing! I have nothing but great things to say!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product , I was actually going to wait a minute to use it but when I went to the pool and needed to wash my hair I thought I&#x27;ll give it a try. When I tell you guys that the moment I put this shampoo on my head I felt a nice cool breezy sensation , I knew something went right ! And it actually made my head have a whole new texture feel definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I always check both good and bad and all 5 or 1 stars makes me skeptical.  If these reviews are fake and this productmakes your hair fall out more flag or spam it. if it works good when I get mine today I will write a good review and and erase this one, I hope it works</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and is way too pricey (for something that doesn&#x27;t work).</li>
    <li> At first I thought the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge was just another gimmick, along with the dozens of other cure-all&#x27;s for those individuals like myself stricken with hair-loss for the majority of their adult life.  But when I tried the shampoo which was clear and had a fresh citrus smell, I was immediately impressed.  I expected a thick and creamy coating, however, a little dab will go a long way. Not only has it been highly rated for 2014 with flourishing positive reviews on Amazon (see for yourself), it is also contains ingredients such as Caffeine, Ketokanazole, and Saw Palmetto that promote hair thickness and quality, supported by ongoing studies and clinical trials. Why not try a hair-loss shampoo that helps end the woes...</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a month and have not seen any results. I USE IT 5 TIMES A WEEK&lt;br /&gt;FOR AT LEAST 2MINUTES. I have not seen any difference. I am going to keep using it for 3 months&lt;br /&gt;and see if i get any good results, and will definitely review it again. But as of right now I think for all these&lt;br /&gt;people who think they have had good results the first week your dreaming, its called a placebo effect&lt;br /&gt;because you want your hair to grow back so badly any little change in hair texture makes you believe your&lt;br /&gt;hair is growing. This product has been overly HYPED!!!! That&#x27;s  why Amazon is capitalizing on the hype. The&lt;br /&gt;could very well be between$15-30 us dollars.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! worth the price! I have thin hair. Only after a few uses, my hair felt and looked thicker, and my hair is not shedding as much. Looking forward to seeing the long term effects!</li>
    <li> A very unique blend of essential oils and other high quality ingredients like saw palmetto are included in the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge shampoo, which combine to create a highly effective product for generating and encouraging hair growth and regeneration as well as the overall quality of hair texture and feel. If used consistently and given enough time the product can produce very discernible results. Nothing is a cure all but the product can be very helpful if your thinning or losing a lot of hair and is definitely a great option that can help with those issues and still leave Your hair looking good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually purchased this before so this review is long due. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used but the smell is nice and it&#x27;s cheaper than the other hair growth products I&#x27;ve used. My boyfriend also likes using it too, which is why I&#x27;m buying another bottle. My hair does shed a lot in general and I feel like this product makes my hair stronger.</li>
    <li> Found this shampoo on my search to strengthen my hair. Whether it&#x27;s stress, age, or just life, I found my hair falling out and clogging the drain more and more. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use as a daily shampoo with natural ingredients (caffeine, saw palmetto) to stimulate the follicles. I find my hair thicker in texture, stronger, and I notice I don&#x27;t lose as many strands. The price is worth it because it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss products due to some thinning of my hair on the sides, and this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Not only has it helped add fullness to my hair, it smells great, too!&lt;br /&gt;The lather is nice and it feels good on my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t so much tingle, as kind of pull everything in tight.&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all I would recommend this to anyone looking for a shampoo to stop the thinning and to smell great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for awhile now and wanted to give it a review since it works so well! It lathers up great and has a nice smell. I can notice the difference in my hair, it has gotten thicker and is also growing back in! This works just like it said it would. I would recommend this to anyone that is experiencing hair loss problems.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and started noticing my hair thinning around the front and sides. A friend suggested I try this shampoo and it is quite amazing.  After about 12 days or so, I started seeing new hair come in around my hairline and after a month my whole head of hair feels fuller and the sides and front are filling in nicely.  It has definitely made a huge difference, I will continue to use and recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair. Over the last couple of years, I have noticed more breakage and thinning spots, and I&#x27;m only 35yrs old! I&#x27;ve tried other thickening serums/shampoos, but to no avail. Until now! I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks and already feeling and seeing more fullness, less breakage. I felt a difference after the 1st use! I use it five times a week as per instructions and I use 2 pumps. I don&#x27;t feel any weird tingly sensations and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It has a light minty smell. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather up like a regular shampoo, so don&#x27;t make that throw you off. You don&#x27;t need more, just enough to massage into your scalp. I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in 8 weeks! I would recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had brown thick hair before I decided to go blond and probably lost 50 % ot my hair because of bad dyes. My hair didn&#x27;t look good anymore and for a girl this is a major problem. I used different products, but nothing seemed to make my hair look better. I recently ordered this shampoo. You know how the coffee wakes you up in the morning and gives you energy and power? May be because of the caffeine in it, I don&#x27;t know, but this is exactly what this shampoo did with my hair--Woke it up-- and now It is groooowing....It feels very nice and smooth when you touch it as well. Very nice product. I am happy :)</li>
    <li> it made my head itch, tried it a few times but couldn&#x27;t get pass the itching, so I am going with another product instead</li>
    <li> I came across this product after going through several different options for my hair loss, my hairline has been receding over the past couple years and become more and more noticeable. After using it for about 2 weeks i started to notice results and my hairline starting to grow back in! So far results have been good looking forward to what a month from now will look like!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Ultrax for a few days, but I can already see a difference. I&#x27;ve always had thin hair - both fine and not a lot of it - and Ultrax has helped both! My hair feels actually thicker (not quite as fine), and I&#x27;ve already noticed that less of it is falling out. Usually I can pull out handfuls of hair at a time (which is so sad, since I have so little) but I&#x27;m already down to just a few hairs per shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;foam up\\&quot; as much as much as a lot of other shampoos do, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest. It tingles on your scalp a bit and you can tell that your hair is getting clean. It does foam a little bit; if foam is your thing, just make sure you&#x27;re hair is really wet. I&#x27;ve found that the wetter my hair, the more foamy it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a really pleasant smell - not chemical, just a little bit sweet, almost like a summer fruit. I leave it in for a few minutes in the shower to try to get all the power of the caffeine. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all - my hair has looked great every day since I&#x27;ve started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product. I&#x27;ve tried everything (shampoos, vitamins, etc) to try to make my hair thicker, and this actually works! I&#x27;m excited to continue using it over the next few weeks to see if I get any additional hair growth like some of the other reviewers!</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if it has made a difference I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it just feels like I wasted 40 bucks :/</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast. Today was my first time using it. So far I like the smell &amp; how it made my hair feel... excited to see how well it works!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot it&#x27;s a very good stimulant hair shampoo product because just after the first time of using it my hair texture has improved, it also makes your hair thicker as well as increasing the growth and making your hair healthier although it says for hair loss I don&#x27;t have any hair loss and it still does a very good job on my hair it&#x27;s definitely worth the money and I have no complaints about it. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried so many different hair products, I could open my own store... This is finally a product that seems to make a difference with my husband&#x27;s thinning hair though. I have an itchy scalp and thin hair and it&#x27;s helped with that too. This is a keeper for us for sure. We&#x27;re REALLY happy that we gave it a try!</li>
    <li> Easy to use build&#x27;s confidence and not like other hair loss shampoos where you have to leave in your hair for long periods of time! My hair is thicker and i must say the woman love me! Recommend any man or woman to buy this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair wasn’t in super bad condition, but the product definitely helped in making the hair become fuller and gave it a better look. The result in the first few days is quite great and as long as I continue using it, the hair stays in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;I too like many other people, were skeptic at first. After sharing it with another friend, he loved it, so yes, I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ultrax Lab Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss product for about 2 weeks and I must say I really do like it.  It has a low lather to it, but it still feels very clean.  The smell is nice and not overly scented like a lot of shampoos out there.  I have very fine hair and it has made my hair feel very soft.  I do feel like I already have a reduction in the amount of hair falling out. It will take some time to see if it helps with new hair growth, so I will post another one later with more results.</li>
    <li> This product did not deliver the results I had hoped for but was okay.</li>
    <li> I paid a lot of money to make my hair loss even worse!! increased the fall out after only 2 uses lost twice as much hair, any positive reviews for this junk are paid reviews, DONT BUY !! not just a waste of money but a toxin to hair follicles &amp; health!!</li>
    <li> The first thing i noticed was the great smell that this shampoo has. then i starting noticing less hair coming out when i washed my hair. My hair feels better/stronger than before i starting using it. If any of these sound good to you this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I do not have a &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34; problem - I have a head full of thick, lustrous hair - but I do have a &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; problem. I was excited to discover this product because I am just plain tired of pulling hair out of the vacuum cleaner and constantly finding it everywhere.  If you&#x27;ve ever lived with a long-haired dog or cat, you know how tedious that can be. For example - it&#x27;s embarrassing when your house guests ask after your health because of the sheer volume of hair they noticed when they kindly emptied the dust reservoir of the roomba...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - the product arrived Friday and this is Monday.  I&#x27;ve used it three out of these four days and this morning I think my brush has somewhat fewer strands of hair caught in its bristles.  As to changing the appearance or texture of my hair - no - but it has done a good job of washing away the perspiration and dust (from a weekend spent doing yard work and cleaning the garden shed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be wearing this shampoo dabbed behind my ears as a fragrance any time soon (thank goodness for the coconut-goodness of my conditioner) but it&#x27;s do-able.  Lather-wise I would describe it as &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; - not huge handfuls of suds but enough to know it&#x27;s on the job - and I appreciate the tingle - it feels like it&#x27;s doing **something**.  A good experience so far and I&#x27;ll follow up at the end of a month with my Spare Hair status.</li>
    <li> I have tight coiled curls and their a bit silky and mildly course, my mother is mixed and my father has an Afro. I chopped my hair off and it was pretty bald at first and this stuff got my hair growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using a cheap shampoo along with this. Another review stated that the liquid is not at all spreadable...very true. DO NOT waste your money by pumping so much to get it all over you hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead buy something cheap like Suave shampoo to squirt just a quarter size of Suave along with one pump of this stuff and you&#x27;ll be able to spread it all over your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually work it in, lather, scratch it in my scalp and leave it in until I finish my other shower routines (about 2-5 minutes) wash your body, facial wash, brush your teeth (yes I do this in the shower much easier and less mess) then rinse it out your hair by scratching it working from the bottom to the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just get that tingling feeling but that&#x27;s only if you get right out the shower and somehow blasted with a fan, cool air, etc.</li>
    <li> With my dad&#x27;s super thin hair, this product has worked wonders for him,  combined with the Ultra Labs supplement pills. You will be skeptical at first but with time you&#x27;ll see results, in my opinion it&#x27;s worth telling others about. I truly recommend this shampoo to anyone having balding problems. You will not be disappointed with Hair Surge &amp;#34;Caffeine&amp;#34; shampoo. It says to leave it in for 2 minutes but I told my dad to leave it in longer for better results, and we did. Just be patient. We didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference right away. But give it time and you&#x27;ll see the results you&#x27;ve been wanting from other products.</li>
    <li> WOW! This product is amazing, it really works and makes my hair grow back 10 times better than it was before!! I would recommend this to everybody!</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo!  Ever since my last two pregnancies, my hair hasn&#x27;t been the same.  I used to have thick strong hair, now it is fragile and breaks. I have lost so much hair over the last year and I have tried everything to help the growth and condition of my hair.  So far nothing has worked, until I started using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Gross Stimulating Shampoo.  In just a week of using this shampoo I already see a difference. I don&#x27;t loose handfuls of hair in the shower or after brushing.  My hair is already fuller and I am confident that with more use, I will see even more growth in strength with my hair thanks to Ultrax Labs Shampoo!</li>
    <li> I truly recommend this shampoo to anyone having balding problems. You will not be disappointed with Hair Surge &amp;#34;Caffeine&amp;#34; shampoo. It says to leave it in for 2 minutes but I used it and told my brother to use it and  to leave it in longer for better results, and we did. Just be patient. We didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference right away. But give it time and you&#x27;ll see the results you&#x27;ve been wanting from other products. This is by far the best shampoo I have used for my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Well let me start off by saying that I have used other products in the past, like Rogaine, Scalp Med etc, I suffer from male pattern baldness.  I only have had mild success with these products and eventually stopped using them altogether.  My brother is getting married next year and I would like to look my best for that event.  So recently I decided to investigate what new hair loss products are available and based on the reviews here and my own research into the three main ingredients I decided to take a chance on this product.  Well am I glad I did, ketoconazole is going to be a rising star in the battle against hair loss.  After using it for one month shampooing every other day there was definitely a difference in how much I was shedding.  Also I saw an improvement in new hair growth!  The other factor was no chemical smell, for me that&#x27;s a big plus!  Overall I am very happy with this product and it&#x27;s performance.  It may cost a little more than your average hair loss shampoo, but if you want better than average results you have to pay for it.</li>
    <li> This definitely lives up to it&#x27;s description. For women with shedding issues, breakage or those who are looking for a few extra inches in length. Using Ultra Labs Hair Surge once  every two weeks in combination with deep conditioning once a month with Mix Chicks Deep Conditioner the hair should take on a natural sheen,  any thinning areas of the hair should begin to thicken and will naturally begin to elongate within 4 to six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also note that results vary depending on how much breakage or damage is already done to your head, some individuals see results in as little as 1 month others in 6. Also note that when embarking on this process flat ironing should be kept to a minimum perhaps once a month and avoid perming because perming causes massive breakage  thus making the process counterproductive. If perming is a must for you minimizes it to 1 or twice a year. Blow dry with medium heat in thin sections, or high heat in thin sections but do not fully dry it. Using the right products in your hair is key to good hair health that also includes the types of combs and brushes used. This product works wonders get yourself into a routine and commit to it, consistency is the best way to tame hair.</li>
    <li> I recently switched over to Ultrax after using a bunch of other products and hair growth treatments that actually damaged my hair  and I was pleasantly surprised.  The treatments made my head tender and my scalp got extremely dry.  The hair regrowth was minimal and not long-lived with the treatments.  The Ultrax shampoo actually made my head feel amazing and tingly while giving me regrowth that stayed.  Dandruff was nonexistent for me as well and now that I found it for much cheaper here on Amazon it is much more affordable as well.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair soft, not rough like the other shampoos. I&#x27;m not sure about the growth part, I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth yet but it does leave my hair soft once I am done washing it.</li>
    <li> This product hasn&#x27;t worked for me. That doesn&#x27;t mean it wouldn&#x27;t for someone else, we are all different. I am thinning a little on top and have noticed no different in 3 weeks of use. Maybe I have a bigger underlying issue, who knows!</li>
    <li> seems to be that making it a little thicker.. could just be my hair getting longer though im not sure</li>
    <li> This shampoo is like none other. It does not strip the hair and provides lasting moisture!&lt;br /&gt;It gives the hair an amazing feel and leaves the hair feeling soft. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> What a great product! This shampoo has a great scent and leaves my hair and scalp feeling great. After several uses I can tell a marked improvement in the thickness of my hair. I look forward to seeing more great results! I really like that they offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee and it&#x27;s made in the good old USA!</li>
    <li> Totally easy way of getting beautiful healthy hair! Makes my hair feel very strong and smooth and I can already see a difference in my thickness :) The process was faster than anticipated and I am so pleased with how my hair looks now after years of thinning! So glad I found this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> This product is absolutly worth the price!!!! Besides the fact that it won an award in 2013 it also works for people with extreme hair loss to people who wanna get a head start on hair preservation and care. I personally started using this stimulating shampoo and felt and saw results in about a week. My hair started coming back in thicker and fuller than before. With these great results this is my number one &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for people dealing with my similar problem</li>
    <li> I love having shampoo that really helps my hair feel fuller and healthier. I have very fine hair and the shampoo gives me strength and volume. I&#x27;m picky and I love all the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Does what the product says it does . By the third application even people started to notice. Make sure to follow the directions if u want positive results. The cap of the bottle needs work though but otherwise fast shipping and a great product.  If it was cheaper I&#x27;m sure more people would buy it.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!! I give it 5 Stars because it is a very pleasant, very appealing and very simple product to use. I like that all I had to do was massage it into my scalp keep it in for about 5 minutes then rinse it out. There was no other steps or products to purchase with it. Other products that I have used included things for me to mix with them or I had to purchase another product to use along side it like pills or some kind of serum. But not with this product it is simple to use and I started to notice result in just a few days. The spot in my head that was without hair started to sprout up in just about 6 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a great smell, look and over all appeal to it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone who is experiencing some hair loss or hair thinning issues. They will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> One thing that struck me about this product is that it relies on natural ingredients to get your hair growing. It seems to me that since aging is a natural process, and its unfortunate side effects (such as hair loss) are as well, there should be a natural path to reversing the trend. I was intrigued by this shampoo&#x27;s reliance on caffeine, which I had never heard of in any context other than it being a stimulant, and after Googling even found links to research showing that it does indeed stimulate hair growth in Wikipedia&#x27;s page on &amp;#34;Management of hair loss.&amp;#34; I also have dry scalp problems, particularly in the winter, and used to use Head &amp; Shoulders exclusively for that reason. The fact that they included ketoconazole in this shampoo, and that it fights dandruff AS WELL as helps prevent hair loss, was a huge plus. Not to be overly patriotic, but in the age of cheaply made overseas products flooding our marketplaces, it was nice to see that this one was made in the states. I&#x27;m very pleased with this shampoo and think it&#x27;s well worth the price--definitely a lot cheaper and less invasive than paying a &amp;#34;hair restoration specialist&amp;#34; for a graft or something equally unpleasant.</li>
    <li> For years I have been losing my hair and have tried every product on the market including rogaine. Most of the results from the others were limited to none at best until I tried Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo. After the first shampoo, I could see the difference. I went to my stylist, that I had been with for years, to ask her opinion and she was absolutely amazed. She wanted to know everything about it and insisted that I go get the bottle for her to see. She may even put it in her product line. There is new hair growth all over the top of my head and with it plus my remaining hair, I feel and look fantastic. Before using it, I felt like an old man but now I feel like I am back on my game when I talk to women twenty and thirty years younger than me  I even quit wearing my ball caps, which I have worn for years because I am so proud of the results. I have a huge collection of them that are now just collecting dust. My friends were shocked too because none of them had ever seen me without a cap. Some of them didn&#x27;t recognize me until I said something to them. I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. It is so much better than the average shampoo. This shampoo is high quality and it smells great. In addition, I noticed how my hair is more sleek and that it grows faster than usual. Another thing that I noticed is that I have beautiful fuller hair after using this product. Furthermore, I had my husband use it as well. He likes it as well. We both noticed how it is helping his hair as well. I will be buying this high quality product again for my husband and I. Also, my husband is glad that he is able to use other hair products with this one.Finally, both of us learned how caffeine in this product helps our hair.</li>
    <li> Every bathroom in every house should have this shampoo! I&#x27;m not bolding but have felt a slight thinning over the past few years. The thinning abruptly stopped yesterday after 4 days of use twice a day. My hair is fuller, thicker and I actually had to comb it this morning since just running my fingers through my hair to style it didnt work. I&#x27;m happy! The shampoo is great. It doesnt have an overpowering scent but instead a subtle clean smell. I will be using this for the rest of my life for sure!</li>
    <li> As soon as I used it, my heart rate was increased considerably as a result I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with irregular heart beat and nearly escaped a heart attach. Surely, did not work for me and I am really happy for been still alive. It is a very dangerous product please be aware</li>
    <li> I do not know who is writing the reviews on this product. I have used this for the past three months. There are s few things I would like to mention  I have coarse hair. It is hard for me to lather the soap into my scalp. My hair clumps. This shampoo made it especially difficult. There was very little foam that was made. I left the shampoo on for two minutes as the bottle states. The soap did not spread evenly. I focused on the area of my scalp in which I am losing hair (i.e. the crown). In these past few months, I have seen an increase in hair loss. To address the issue of foam formation, I first washed my hair with regular shampoo. After I rinse that shampoo off, I then lather the Ultrax Lab Hair Surge. It seemed to solve the foaming issue. Nonetheless, I have seen no decrease in hair loss. In fact, hair falls out every time I brush or comb it. This was an extremely expensive product and I do not find the results warrant another purchase. On a side note, the aroma of the shampoo is not bad. Nevertheless, I shall go for shampoos that are a tenth of the cost of this shampoo with a more pleasant odor.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely incredible! The hair restoring effect is practically instantaneous and it&#x27;s such a good shampoo to boot. It smells good, lathers on well and leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky. It may be a pretty penny but it&#x27;s absolutely worth it. Hair is a beautiful thing and certainly something worth keep. If paying a little extra for my shampoo every month keeps something that is truly valuable and totally irreplaceable, I think that&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really helped thicken my hair. I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in both the strength and softness of my hair in a surprisingly short amount of time. I plan on buying another when this one runs out and recommending it to my friends who have similar issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product, a week and a half to two weeks, and already I&#x27;ve seen pleasing results. I think I&#x27;m supposed to use it 5 time a week but 3 is enough to start getting my good looking hair back. I&#x27;ve bought one bottle for my dad and his brother and sent another to a cousin of mine whose been stressed out a lot because of his hair loss. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seeing very interesting results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tingling I noticed with the first application told me that something was starting to happen, In only about a week I began to see fine hair sprouting from areas on the top of my scalp that had not seen hair follicles​ in five years. I am into my fourth week of daily shampooing  and I am very pleased and somewhat amazed to see the results thus far. The possibility sporting a full head of hair once again is exciting.. This product has let me dream again. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hair Surge contains caffeine that really stimulates your scalp. It has very little foam and gives your hair lots of volume. This is a very high quality shampoo  that smells fantastic and makes the hair thicker after the first use!</li>
    <li> When talking about this shampoo I think “Hair surge” is truly the correct terminology. Being someone with hair on the finer side one of my aims was to find shampoo that would build up a ”robustness” in my hair. I’ve tried many other hair-loss treatments and have had marginal success. However, after using the Ultrax shampoo for a while now I am pleasantly surprised by the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a fair amount of research before settling on this shampoo. Many of the reviews said it worked so I was hopeful. I looked into some of the case studies behind the active ingredients in the hair surge shampoo. Ketoconazole, which is one of the unique ingredients in the Ultrax formula, has been proven to show reduced hair loss. A quick Google search found several studies, which supported this. Since I’m a big advocate of scientific proof I thought I would give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for a while now, im down around half a bottle. However my results do show, and not just a little.  The directions said to use the shampoo 5 time a week, however I’m used to taking showers every day thus I used it more than they said. I can’t say that this benefited me more than their recommendation, however I can say that my routine worked! You’re supposed to leave the shampoo on your hair for 2-3 minuets like conditioner. After you rinse it out you’re left with a pleasant clean feeling unlike some other hair loss shampoo I’ve tried which leaves your hair greasy and oily.  I’m not sure if it was just me but the shampoo didn’t really lather, some other people said this in their reviews too so I think is just the shampoos nature. However it does work nonetheless. Besides my hair feeling thicker it looks much more volumeness and less hair actually falls out when I brush my hair. This gives me the impressions that the overall condition of my scalp is become healthier and can only improve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this shampoo? Absolutely. If you’re someone like me, in question of their hair condition and wants to see an improvement than you can benefit from this. While not immediately, I did see a major difference faster than I though. Now my hair is fuller and thicker. This would be the ONE hair thinning treatment that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This Ultra Labs Stimulating Shampoo works quite amazingly. The product itself has all the active ingredients to build really healthy hair follicles. The most important ingredient is, of course, caffeine that stimulates hair growth as an active, catalytic agent. This would make your hair regrow into thicker and more luxuriant hair. The caffeine element directly applies to the root of the hair and therefore stimulates the follicular tags. This would then easily revitalize the follicular tags that are weak and withering. There are other active ingredients that contain different functions as well. For example, Ketoconazole is an anti-fundal and anti-inflammatory medication for people who suffer from androgenetic alopecia. The effect of this shampoo truly unparalleled and it’s not the same as the intakes from food or drinks. If you can keep using it, the regrowth process would be much more effective.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that actually strengthens and fortifies hair for years now and not just label it on the shampoo bottle like most companies do. I noticed recently that my hair has been thinning and that more and more of it was coming out as I showered and went on with my day; then come my search for a product that will strengthen and prevent any further loss hair. I have just started using the Ultrax Labs shampoo for a few days and noticed a huge difference in my hair already! Before using the product, I would lose about 20 strands of hair upon each time I showered and have seen that number drop tremendously. I use it every day and am excited to see the results in the near future, I will keep you posted!&lt;br /&gt;I knew I had to try out the shampoo when I read about the studies that Ultrax Labs has conducted to perfect the shampoo and the easy to read descriptions of the ingredients that are contained inside and the purpose of it. They labeled everything clearly for the user and made sure that we understood the purpose of each ingredient. I highly recommend this shampoo for both men and women who are struggling with hair loss or even those who just want stronger, vibrant hair, you won’t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has done a wonderful job of making my hair feel clean, making my scalp feel healthy, and I see less hair falling out in the shower and less clumps collecting in my hair brush. After a few weeks I have definitely noticed hair growth and so far I&#x27;m impressed! My hair feels thicker and I look forward to the continued benefits. I highly recommend it to anyone suffering from hair loss and only wish I would&#x27;ve bought this sooner!</li>
    <li> have only used this for the past three days, but its certainly like no other shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used! stimulating is the best to describe how it feels while i&#x27;m working it in. hair definitely feels like it has more volume than with other shampoos. i haven&#x27;t been too worried about hair loss... just thinning. thus far, this seems like its going to make a difference for me!</li>
    <li> Amazed and surprised but I have to say that there is a noticeable difference. And It&#x27;s not just me, my wife says she feels it&#x27;s thicker. It has definitely slowed down the hair loss big time. It also makes my hair feel really clean, soft and manageable. This isn&#x27;t the first product I&#x27;ve tried but it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve tried. I recommend this product to anyone looking to make a true difference in their hair loss, great product.</li>
    <li> This product looks and sounds great! I&#x27;m going to give it a try and see if it works! I can&#x27;t wait to try it and tell everyone to use it!:D</li>
    <li> An old Ford will get you from point A to point B, but a new Cadillac is an entirely different machine. Same here, you can pay $5 for a bottle of suave shampoo, and you will have clean hair, but it will not be healthy or thick, and will come out in handfuls. This is an entirely different product! Everyone wants to know if this stuff works: yes, it does, and that is why you pay more for it. If you take the time to read the description, this bottle has won numerous awards, and has stacks of research behind it, as well as great testimonials. It is well worth it for your hair! What is not advertised is that it contains peppermint oil, which is excellent for your hair. That, with the caffeine, penetrates your scalp and opens the follicles to receive more oxygen, which lets your hair grow much better. It also smells like what it is, peppermint and menthol; nothing unnatural here. I love it! I only have to use it every other day, and it has stopped the receding hairline completely, and given me thicker, more natural looking hair. You really shouldn&#x27;t expect anything different. This is the easiest and best thing you can do for your hair, do yourself a favor and try it out!</li>
    <li> I am hooked! I was honestly really skeptical about this product at first. One of my friends actually recommended this after he had a bad hair cut so I thought I should try it for my MPB. Interestingly, I actually started to notice less and less hair on my pillow in the morning. I have tried vitamin supplements and biotin with out much luck. I suppose it turns out that my hair just needs some extra energy in the morning to do its job!</li>
    <li> Amazon verified. I was amazed at how quickly I received results after the first couple of shampoos. Since using this shampoo my hair has become fuller and stronger with less breakage. One bottle definitely goes a long way.  I give this product five stars and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this shampoo my hair has been stronger (less shedding when brushing, combing, washing, etc.) and looks healthier in general.  I&#x27;ve had fewer split ends and MUCH less breakage (a major problem for me) than before.  Ultrax Labs shampoo produces a nice, rich, lather that thoroughly cleans my hair removing dirt/oil (my hair gets very oily) without making hair feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not take much shampoo (one or two pumps) to get my hair clean, so one bottle lasts a long time.  Most importantly, (to me at least) the shampoo has a very pleasant smell.  I&#x27;ve used hair stimulating/medicated shampoos in the past that smelled absolutely, embarrassingly, horrible.  Ultrax shampoo has a very nice, almost minty, smell so no one who knows me would guess that I am using a growth stimulating shampoo on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am planning on getting a bottle for a family member who is dealing with female hair loss, and I really recommend this shampoo to anyone who is having a hard time growing out their hair OR dealing with excessive hair shedding/loss.</li>
    <li> Does not work. I had more hair fallout while using this product. Price is ridiculous. Contains SLS which strips color if you dye your hair.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product I am seeing great results! The smell is nice to and you get a great lather!</li>
    <li> Saw no differencewith use.</li>
    <li> It has made very little difference at all. I have to use a lot of it to cover my scalp because it does no create foam. It does have any type of sudsy foam.  Not impressed. I will not order a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Not worth the cost. Been using it for 2 months now and have had no results.</li>
    <li> Hard to tell if it works or not. Pricey. I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> My Daughter is having problems with hair loss and breakage and has started using various hair growth supplements. This Hair surge caffeine stimulating shampoo is a great addition for a total and complete treatment. This way she can be covered, inside and out!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I love that I don&#x27;t have to remember to take a pill. I just use it like regular shampoo and it thickens my hair!</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave this a 3 is I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth. I do love the fact that my hair looks fuller. I don&#x27;t like that my hair is all tangled after washing, guess that&#x27;s &#x27;cause it is &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; no leftover residue. I will keep using because it&#x27;s the FIRST shampoo that really &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; my hair.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of thinking (via the picture) that this was a huge bottle. That&#x27;s what you expect for $40. But that&#x27;s on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not apply this to my scalp and once again feel the rush of leaving my mother&#x27;s womb or the magic of the ability to fly as in a dream or whatever everyone else felt. Nor did some basic things occur, like my hair feeling or looking great. But my hair does feel much more expensive now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gonna try the $4 Dove Thickening Fortifying Shampoo. I have a suspicion that it will be better than this one.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working and I think it would work faster if I were using it every day.  I think that if you use this in concert with Biotin and good diet and exercise, it does improve the hair volume, texture and length.  Also rinse in the coldest water you can stand to seal the follicle.  Overall - pleased with outcome.</li>
    <li> Very good - smells good too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having some thinness happening on the top part of my hair, I started using this two weeks ago and I&#x27;m starting to notice the fullness coming back. This product actually gave me a bonus, it keeps my hair moist all day if I use it everyday, which is weird but awesome.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hair Maxx Ultrax Labs tablets for a few weeks now, and I must say I have seen a big enough difference to want to order another bottle before I finish these. Hair Maxx by Ultra Labs is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to get my hair to stop shedding I also like the fact that the ingredients are natural. It has vitamins, minerals and herbs that will help my hair stop shedding and look healthier.Best of all they are affordable and works with my budget. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone with, hair growth and thinning problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 2 weeks now;  I have short, fine hair with little to no damage,  and although I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference,  I feel like it thas definitley improved some.  My hair is thicker,  and it shines more.  A natural shine is definitely different from a hair product one.  My scalp is healthier.  I have less hair falling out when I shower and brush my hair.  If you want a miracle,  don&#x27;t buy.  If you just want SOME improvement to your hair and scalp,  then this product is for you.</li>
    <li> The name of the product is Hair Surge.  It’s still too early for me to tell whether or not hair growth will be stimulated; I have only been using this shampoo for a short while.  I have a little thinning near the right side of my upper forehead and truly hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I definitely like the way this product makes my hair look and feel.  My dark locks appear shiny, my hair seems considerably more manageable, and the flyaway strands have disappeared.  It’s important to mention you only need a small amount of shampoo to produce a rich lather; my hair is long and I barely use any.  Still, I read that you should take the time to massage the product into the scalp for a couple of minutes if you want improved thickness, so that is what I am doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I really like it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo will not feel like other shampoos. It will not lather as much. Your hair will not feel silky after shampooing and may even feel waxy. (You should also use the Ultrax Hair Solace Conditioner in my humble opinion!) But keep using the product! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and my hair feels thicker and stronger than it has in a very long time. The scent is not bad - smells minty fresh, but all in all, nice results.</li>
    <li> Who cares, it seemed to thicken my hair as much as minoxidil. I use it daily and it doesn&#x27;t seem to strip my hair like a lot of shampoos would. I liked the smell of the old formula better but the new one has more tingle. As a male that is reluctant to let my hair go, this for me was an additive to the minoxidil treatments that I still use.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me 1 bottle as gift a while ago, it worked, after several weeks of use, my hair is thickening, so I am buying 2nd bottle from Amazon, after this one, I might try combining with Ultrax Labs conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus is this shampoo works great as shampoo too, and the price is on par with other luxury premium shampoo.</li>
    <li> in the pic the bottle looks HUGE - but the reality so small and expensive for its size.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Actually works over time!</li>
    <li> The full Body Formula really is great. Great product!</li>
    <li> Well first I tried a Minoxidil based product as I read on wikipedia that it&#x27;s best used in young men with around 5 years of hair thinning or loss. The Minoxidil made me shed tons of hair but with continued use I grew new hair, weird I know. So anyways I wanted to try something else and this was the first product with plenty of 5 star reviews on Amazon that I saw. So far I have noticed some new hair growth, like little baby hairs coming in. Second it leaves my hair feeling very nice and soft, kind of poofy and squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read the product description and saw all this....&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Active Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;  • Caffeine - Studies have shown that when applied transdermally, this powerful ingredient can help extend the life cycle of hair follicles and encourage healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;  • Ketoconazole - This powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal ingredient is commonly seen in prescription strength dandruff shampoo&#x27;s. What wasn&#x27;t realized until recently is just how powerful this ingredient can be for people with thinning hair. While the exact mechanisms in how it works aren&#x27;t know, there are ongoing studies that are attempting to pinpoint exactly whats makes ketokanazole so potent. Hair Surge contains 0.2% Ketoconazole.&lt;br /&gt;  • Saw Palmetto - Clinical trials have shown that Saw Palmetto may block an enzyme, 5-alpha-reductase, which facilitates the change of testosterone into DHT. DHT is considered a major cause for both mail and female pattern baldness.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;.....I knew I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a month when I should be nearing the end of the bottle, but so far I am seeing results(hair regrowth/stimulation) and no longer using Minoxidil based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that I suffer from male pattern baldness, centrally, so I can&#x27;t comment on what it&#x27;s doing to the side and back of my head yet(maybe it&#x27;ll get more fuller). And one more thing, the products this shampoo contains are backed by some science(just like allsupplements), which is what got me to buy it.</li>
    <li> I think this shampoo was awesome.  It left my scalp feeling very tingly, both while I was using it and after.  And I didn&#x27;t have to use very much of it either.  I noticed afterwards, that my sink didn&#x27;t have a lot of hair in it, as it usually does.  And when my hair was dry, it felt fuller, and silkier, and it looks like it&#x27;s growing back in places where it was going bald.  So far, I am very happy with this shampoo and it&#x27;s results.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to report that it didn&#x27;t work for me. I was initially disappointed at the small 8-ounce bottle, after paying over $40. That means I paid close to a dollar a teaspoon (5ml). (That&#x27;s quite okay with me -- if the product works). I see on a closer look at the details provided by the seller that it has 0.2 percent ketoconazole (yes, two-tenths of a percent). Most products I know of that contain ketoconazole are either 1% or 2. Two-tenths of a percent seems exceedingly low. In the end, it worked as a normal (somewhat bubble-gum-smelling) shampoo. I hope you have a better experience.</li>
    <li> All other hair loss products pale in comparison to those in Ultrax Labs&#x27;s selection. Ditch your creams, your pills, your magic beans - this is the real deal. Don&#x27;t waste any extra time applying things; just shampoo as normal and you&#x27;ll start to see your hair loss slow. It took a little time before I started to see real growth again, but the loss stopped very quickly, and the new growth followed after just a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works! I have been losing hair for the past ten years or so.  I am only 40, so I have been looking for something that could help. I have used this shampoo for about a month, and I have really noticed less and less hair coming out in the shower and when I brush it out.  I am so happy to finally find something that helps!</li>
    <li> Due to so many great reviews and the reasonable price will purchase due to my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works..but it feels good going on.</li>
    <li> A guarantee that it works! It does take some time, but the product leaves my hair shiny and fuller by the first two weeks I used it. I bleach and dye my hair a LOT, so this worked wonders repairing my hair! I definitely decreased in shedding and it&#x27;s really growing back lots of fuzzy hair at the hairline. Super happy about this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have only just started using the product but i think I see improvement in my thin edges. After I use it some more i think it will be an useful product.</li>
    <li> Smells like Pine sol and it didn&#x27;t work for me. Totally not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I can already see significant new hair growth. It is a bit pricey, but so is the value of my self esteem! Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair and my scalp was stimulated.  Washed my hair on 3 different occasions to check it out.  Well, it may not work for everyone but it was ok with me. The soap lathered very well and my hair had a clean feel afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great Buy, feels great in my hair, was recommended from a family friend, seen results with my own eyes from the friend, whoever is having a problem with hair loss, I suggest you purchase this to gain your hair back</li>
    <li> I just started using this shampoo so I know that it takes at least 30 days to start seeing results with any product.  But I can say this is a different shampoo in a good way.  You can tell that there is something powerful in it that is working on your scalp and the ends of your hair. My hair is naturally thick and super dry in the summer.  I shed a lot due to color on my ends that is now growing out.  So I am hoping this shampoo will help me keep some strands.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working great! I have been using it for about three weeks now and have noticed a reduction in hair loss throughout the day on my shirts, when brushing , and also when showering. I used to be able to run my fingers through my hair and loose clumps everytime. This no longer happened two weeks into using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Products!</li>
    <li> My husbands hair line was receding and hair was thinning out, though he looks handsome as when I first met him:).  He tried other hair loss remedies without success and they all smelled weirded. When I came across this product I thought of my husband....So far, He loves it! less dryness on his scalp! I can definitely see less hair loss. His hair feels nice and soft yet thicker and fuller. This product make my husband happy and WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> This is the miracle I&#x27;ve been waiting for! I&#x27;ve ordered this a few times now and I just can&#x27;t get over how effective it is. I noticed that my hairline started receding, and being a twenty-something in NYC, that doesn&#x27;t fly. Since I&#x27;ve started using this shampoo there has been a noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is nervous about hair loss, I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works. I was looking to add thickness and shine to my hair and this product gives me both. It smells great and really helped with hair growth even though I didn&#x27;t really have any actual &amp;#34;hair loss&amp;#34; it did a great job filling it all in. I will continue to buy this product as it is definitely a great deal, does what it says, and lasts a long time!! A+ !</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says and more  I was iffy about trying this but after a few uses I noticed a difference in my hair.  After the first try I noticed right away my hair was feeling luxuriously soft and was having a healthy looking shine to it , Not to mention the great smell my hair had I would defiantly recommend this to friends and family</li>
    <li> I was surprised, I noticed some hair regrowth from using this.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product in May (along with the conditioner). I didn&#x27;t notice any difference then and no difference now. I didn&#x27;t want to get my refund right away because I believe in trying out a product for at least 3 months. Well, it is now September 2nd and after spending too much money for 3 bottles of this shampoo and 3 bottles of the conditioner, I finally give up. I shampoo daily with the products, but NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL!! I am very frustrated at this point. I wish I could get my money back!  I don&#x27;t mind spending this kind of money if it made at least a notable difference, but not when it did nothing at all. It might have worked for some, but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I’ve only been using this item for 2 weeks but I can see already that it is working. I am not bald in any way but thin in certain parts of my head, mainly the crown of my head. I never expected it to work but the clearly thinning area has filled in a since using this. I will continue to use this and have already ordered more!</li>
    <li> i think it helps maintain what hair you have left... but i haven&#x27;t really found evidence of stimulated growth.</li>
    <li> I just finished the bottle so thought I&#x27;d write a review based on my experience. This shampoo did absolutely nothing. It didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker, grow back, or stop hair loss. I&#x27;m a late 40&#x27;s male with baldness happening and this product failed miserably. It&#x27;s not even a good shampoo - no good smell, no thickness...nothing - I could have rinsed my hair with water and got the same result. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that has been thick, but as I am now rounding out my 30&#x27;s, it isn&#x27;t quite as dense.  I have been using Hair Surge for about a month now and I am impressed by how it gives my hair body and cleans well.  Often I rotate brands and need a clarifier every three or four weeks because of build-up.  I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is more dense, but it has a lot more volume and it make styling more of a pleasure. :-)</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic!  As I&#x27;ve been getting older, I&#x27;ve noticed some thinning in the heaviest part of my crown, and I started getting self conscious about it.  This product not only makes your scalp invigorated (and feels like the hair is actually growing as you use it), but I&#x27;ve noticed a thickness and fullness developing in my problem areas.  It smells fresh and feels great!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t prevent my hair from continuing to fall out, nor did it regrow any... Basically just an extremely overpriced normal shampoo.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using it 3 weeks. Already see a difference. I am going to reorder this shampoo again even though the price is a bit steep.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my mother who has experienced significant hair loss while on her new medication. I didn&#x27;t think that something as simple as changing her shampoo (nothing else to do!) would actually give her the results that she has seen. Even after the 3rd use she saw less hair loss and we can&#x27;t wait for the regrowth to kick in! We were also happy about the natural ingredients and the fragrance! :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing about this product to spread the good work. This is a great shampoo if you have thinning hair or if you&#x27;ve lost your hair. I have thin hair and i would get my hair cut close to conceal the thinning spots. I no longer to this. Why? Ultrax Labs Hair Surge. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few month and my hair is fuller and I can grow it out. I&#x27;m more confident too because I look better with this thicker, fuller hair. I&#x27;m very happy. 5 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> Would you like to regrow hair using a product you are already familiar with? Well, most people are familiar with shampoo as they use shampoo everytime they shower or bathe. Ultra Labs Hair Growth stimulating shampoo will work deep into your hair follicles and not wash away necessary ingredients like other shampoos.</li>
    <li> So I recently noticed I&#x27;m missing a few hairs on my head here and there and thought why not add a thickening shampoo to my hair growth routine. I was recommended this product from a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve researched it has been scientifically proven that adding caffeine to shampoo does promote hair growth. I checked the ingredients listed and they are all natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are you are supposed to use the shampoo five times a week. Leaving it in for about 5 minutes each shampooing. It is a very relaxing lather and will work to remove any existing dandruff as well, thanks to the Ketoconazole ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone who has noticed their hair is thinning or has a problem with dandruff. In the end what do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> Immediately I could feel the difference this shampoo provided. Soft , shiny, and  looking forward to see the long lasting effects.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really works great.  It lathers up quite nicely and applies easily into the hair and scalp.  I never knew I could get such fabulous results from such an easy to aquire product.  I would highly recommend this shampoo to any one who is needing hair growth stimulation.  I just can not wait for my mom to try this product too.</li>
    <li> This product provided good results in about 2 1/2 weeks. I used it 3 times a week and  I saw a big difference. When I washed my hair there was so much less of it in  the bottom of my tub. The downside of using this product is that you must use it 5 days a week which can be expensive.</li>
    <li> Many people fail to realize that there is a big difference in shampoos.  First of all, professional shampoos, such as Ultrax Labs Hair Surge, are concentrated, not watered down.  That means you use less of the product.  Professional shampoos lather less than you might expect because they are free from sulfates, but you don&#x27;t need lather to do a great job of shampooing. So don&#x27;t expect lots of lather with this product. Hair Surge has a faint pleasant aroma,without being overwhelming.  I have used the product just once, but it seems like it has great promise. My only complaints are with the directions.  Like most shampoos, you are directed to lather.  Unlike most shampoos, there is no direction to rinse well.</li>
    <li> Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo by Ultrax Labs of course cost a bit more due to the specialized ingredients such as Ketoconazole (anti fungal) and Saw Palmento. which are shown to help grow hair to it&#x27;s fullest potential.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit and I am impressed.  As with any premium shampoo, you do not need a lot, (one pump will do it) and it does not lather a lot, but my hair is so clean and soft and the fragrance is slightly citrus and not overwhelming and does not linger so it will not clash with any fragrance you may wear.  I have noticed less hair in both the drain and in my hairbrush which is very encouraging.  I also color my hair and this shampoo has left my hair very manageable.  The pump bottle is very convenient , so it should last a long time.  I feel it&#x27;s a quality product with great results.  If you hair loss can be helped, my thought is this stuff will surely do it.</li>
    <li> My husband has been battling hair loss for years and finally decided to get a mini transplant for the areas that needed the most help. Is seemed to help thicken out the hair in the beginning but eventually most of it came out and looked worse/ uneven and choppier than it initially did before the surgery. This surgery happened several years ago and now left him extremely disappointing because he had tried everything from shampoos to the spray in your hair cans in the past, with this unsuccessful surgery being the last straw.&lt;br /&gt;This year I myself could relate to his woes with hair issues because shortly after I delivered our first child, i was shocked to find out many women go thru a hormonally related post-postpartum hair loss immediately after the birth of children! I have always had decent hair but now it was falling out in huge clumps it seemed every time i attempted to brush or wash it, even just waking up in the mornings my pillow and clothes were saturated with my hair! I was so worried because it was such a drastic difference from my old thick hair that I decided to research and do something to save my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After buying this product ( heard from a hairdresser friend that it worked well) and using it daily I was beyond relieved that my hair was not falling out anymore but more importantly It felt stronger than ever and regained its original thickness and then some.&lt;br /&gt;The even more telling sign that this product was a gem of a find was I had my husband start using it on his problem areas he&#x27;s had for years after the hair transplant went bad and sure enough his hair where it used to be bald or just plain patchy started to regrow!! He had little baby fine hairs growing in the crown area of his hair and the patchiness started to slowly fill in and look like an even head of hair.I am so beyond impressed with this shampoo i will be re buying more for both my husband and Myself. Even though i initially thought the price was a bit high, it is priceless compared to how much confidence we both regained after our hair was back to looking great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It smells really good almost like a citrus smell. The bottle has a nice salon pump on top to ensure you get the perfect amount. So far I have seen great improvement with hair growth. My hair used to be thin and it is starting to become more full in just a weeks worth of use. I love this product I would recommend this product to anyone with hair growth problems!</li>
    <li> I do depend on the reviews when buying products online. This product is very expensive but I have bought it hoping that it would give better result than other products which was a bad decision. Since I have start using this shampoo my hair start falling more rapidly and had to stop it before losing all of my hair and getting bold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has to do something about the fake reviews before people loss trust on such an important feature.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it! This product doesn&#x27;t make my scalp tingle (like most others like this) which I like. It does seem to leave my hair rougher than usual when it dries, but I am seeing less hair in my brush every day. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff gave my thin hair new life.  I decided to try it after reading about recent uses for caffeine beyond being an AM pickup, and I am happy that I did.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this Ultrax Labs shampoo after getting absolutely no results with all other brands of voluminizing shampoos and conditioners for my fine and flat hair. Granted it&#x27;s pretty pricey, but I am absolutely psyched about the results!!! For the first time in years my hair has more volume and shine and it even grows faster. In fact, this is the best my hair has ever looked. And since I only need a small amount for washing my long hair this bottle can easily last me 6 months or longer. Plus, I don&#x27;t even need any of those voluminizing styling products anymore, so I am definitely saving money on hair care stuff with this shampoo. Now, that&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
    <li> Its alright,  I have used other products and it seems to be just the same.</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month and a half and there have been subtle results.  I will continue to use and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is incredible and delivers results FAST. I am young and not losing hair yet, but I started to use this and already by the second week I noticed my hair growing in thicker, leaving me to assume that new hairs were starting to grow in. I didn&#x27;t let that &amp;#34;sell&amp;#34; me on the product though; so I told my mom to use it as she has been experiencing thinning hair and slight receding hair in some places. She also immediately noticed results with little new hairs growing everywhere!! This shampoo also made my hair super soft and I really like the smell of it, my boyfriend even noticed and told me my hair smells nice!</li>
    <li> Great tingly feeling and scalp and hair feel great  :)</li>
    <li> After my second pregnancy i&#x27;ve started losing hair like crazy. i know that some hair loss after pregnancy is normal but i didn&#x27;t expect it to be that much! anyway, i&#x27;ve bought this shampoo and was really surprised as it made a huge difference within the first weeks of using it. i&#x27;ve got my shedding under control and my hair looked so much fuller and thicker!&lt;br /&gt;it is a little expensive, but in my opinion totally worth it.</li>
    <li> No results after over 1 month. I&#x27;d say this product is all hype and no results. I should have known better anyway.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed teh product first time I used it, must say it feels good use it each time I need a wash to grow back hair, me and anyone I know need of it. The feeling product and smell fine, just put some hand and wash away, which believe great product use , and great experience.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products that pledge to thicken my hair and increase volume.Some have worked, others have not. This shampoo is amazing. I love it because it actually makes my hair feel fuller. After just a few washes, my hair felt stronger and thicker, and after a few weeks my hair had filled in so much. Now my hair is much fuller, thicker and longer!I would absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> it smells pretty good and i checked out the website for the product and it seems like it does as it suppose to .</li>
    <li> I should have known most of the 5 star reviews were fakes but just decided to waste the money to see if there is miracle.&lt;br /&gt;If this works, biotech companies won&#x27;t spend so much money to try to find the cure.&lt;br /&gt;For genetic related hair loss, the mix of vitamin, minerals and caffeine will not do a dent.&lt;br /&gt;Hope I am the last idiot taking the chance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with hair breakage and growth, I had heard that caffeine helped reduce hair loss/breakage and promote growth. I looked into  different products and decided to try this one. It was top-rated in 2015 and had good reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it for short time and already I see a difference in shedding and breakage!</li>
    <li> Pros: It WORKS! I have had long, thick hair my entire life that was the envy of most people. However, as I have aged, I noticed my hair thinning, especially around the temples and hairlines. As a woman, this was very depressing and unsightly to have a receding hair line and balding areas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week or so of daily use, I noticed little, fine baby hairs growing from the areas where my hair was thinning and balding. Within six weeks, the sections have been completely filled in. This shampoo definitely did what it said it would do and stimulated the growth and follicles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_____&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1). The shampoo hardly foamed at all and it wasn&#x27;t very &#x27;spreadable.&#x27; It was almost like applying hair gel in terms of how little it foamed. The first couple of uses left my hair feeling dirty and matted because the shampoo just didn&#x27;t seem to lather or spread enough to cover my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I remedied this: I used my usual $5 TresSemme Anti-Breakage shampoo I get from the the grocery store. I would shampoo my hair normally with this for its lather and cleansing properties. Then I would rinse it out. THEN I would apply the Hair Surge shampoo. The residue from the previous shampoo would help the Hair Surge shampoo lather my scalp. I would then leave the Hair Surge shampoo on my scalp while I soaped up my body. When finishing up, I rinse it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I just didn&#x27;t feel like it worked as a stand-alone shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2). I do feel the product was a bit over-priced. Yes, it works. However, the bottle was so small, I needed another shampoo to fully cleanse my hair since I felt Hair Surge didn&#x27;t really help with lather/cleansing the hair, and I noticed other shampoos with similar ingredients which can be purchased for about $15. So I felt a bit price gouged on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_____&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: It worked but I most likely will not purchase this again due to the price, small bottle, and lack of cleansing ability. I just purchased another shampoo from Amazon that contains caffeine and similar ingredients to this shampoo. It was only a little over $10 so I will try that one to see if it works as well as this one.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is like MAGIC! I have only been using it for a couple of weeks but have already noticed the difference. I have always had thick hair but after I had my daughter I started losing it due to the hormones. I was upset &amp; depressed about my hair falling it, in chunks! My husband started noticing my hair loss which made me feel self concious about it. Well not anymore! Thanks to this shampoo my hair is not falling out anymore, or as much. There is the normal strands that fall off daily but I feel that it&#x27;s even less than that. I could not be happier with this product &amp; I will continue to use it to grow &amp; thicken my hair. I would recommend this product to any new mommy since it has helped me!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo . My hair shedding stopped after a week . I am using it with hair supplements and minoxidil .  I have to wait at least cuple of months to see the optimum result . I do definitely recommend this to my friends who are suffering from hair shedding .</li>
    <li> Purchased both this shampoo and conditioner and i love it, works great. I definately recommend this product for washing your hair.</li>
    <li> First, I really like the citrus smell. A lot of brand name shampoos are just too sweet smelling for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re doing a 2 way test on this shampoo - me and my husband.&lt;br /&gt;Me - I wash my hair every 3 days. The Caffeine Hair Loss shampoo makes my hair smoother, less frizzy, and it looks a lot fuller. My hair isn&#x27;t shedding as much, too - that&#x27;s a big plus because it means I actually have MORE HAIR. I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo and I&#x27;m willing to pay the price. (Mature ladies must try this).&lt;br /&gt;My husband - he&#x27;s lost a lot of hair on top. The shampoo makes his hair look fuller, so he&#x27;s happy. He bought Rogaine and never tried it because it was too complicated to use, but shampooing is easy. We&#x27;re checking for hair regrowth, will get back with results, but his hair definitely looks thicker.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that my hair would not respond to these ingredients. I was wrong. I got the product, opened it, washed my hair immediately. I let me hair slightly air dry and then took a round brush to finish a style blow dry. My hair looks amazing. It&#x27;s so full and seems like there is some life restored in it. This is JUST the first use. I can&#x27;t wait to see what results I continue to get.</li>
    <li> Bottle came without top dispenser!.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a miracle product. I&#x27;ve used it for only 2 weeks and I can clearly see results already. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wow, this really works, beginning with the first treatment. My hair was definitely thicker after the first use and my scalp had a nice tingle to it. I&#x27;ve already told my buddy about this as it does exactly what it promises.</li>
    <li> I just had a haircut and this came in perfect time. It smells invigorating and you only need a tiny bit to get your hair lathered up. As soon as I started working it in I noticed a tingling sensation that actually woke me up as I was sleep deprived. I waited a few minutes before washing it out. By that time the caffeine hit. It was refreshing and I jumped out of the shower energized and ready to demolish my day. I styled my hair and noticed that I hadn&#x27;t used my conditioner. I didn&#x27;t need to! My hair was soft and manageable. I&#x27;ll have to wait to report on the hair re-growth effects but if my first use is any indication I will be stoked that it keeps my 44 year old head of hair stable! I&#x27;ll have to tell my brother about this as wearing a pilot helmet has taken its toll on his head!</li>
    <li> Tried this product on a whim and was surprised at the results. It makes my hair feel thicker, lush, and adds some volume.. It wasn&#x27;t overnight, but within a few weeks of using it, I did perceive a difference in the quality of my hair.  Once applied, there&#x27;s a tingling sensation that soothes the scalp but also makes it feel like if it&#x27;s working.  As said before, give it some time and you should see positive results.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely something worth trying !</li>
    <li> I recommend Hair Surge both as a shampoo &amp; and as a hair growth product. It lathers well, smells good (spicy), and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp but more importantly it is also giving me my hair back! I was skeptical before buying but I wasn&#x27;t let down- I have only used the product for 10 days but the growth is noticeable.</li>
    <li> After having my two boys, I noticed my hair thinning. Having tried numerous hair products to gain some thickness and volume back, I am happy I found Hair Surge. Within a week, I was seeing less hair falling off my scalp, and more volume when styling. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Lovely product. This shampoo arrived as described and I love the idea of caffeine accelerating my hair growth. I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change in how much hair sheds. Great lather, great smell, overall a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> Customer Service never returns calls when asked about their ingredients.  I see that the product uses sodium laureth sulfate which has been clinically shown to produce baldness.  It defeats the purpose of the product having this main ingredient in their shampoo..  All major shampoo&#x27;s that don&#x27;t care about the hair of an individual use this project.  You need to research these products before buying a product with sodium laurel sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Buy Dove shampoo with caffeine for $4.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a thinning crown since my mid 20&#x27;s, luckily I don&#x27;t have peaks or a receding hairline so I decided to fight my baldness.  I used this shampoo in conjunction with Rogaine for exactly a year I bought 2 bottles of the stuff.  It definitely helped me maintain my hair and grow a little bit of peach fuzz back.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, it&#x27;s more for maintenance than new growth.  When I started using it I shed a lot less from my crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning, even though I used this stuff will make you grow hair everywhere.  I have hair follicles coming out of my forehead, upper cheeks, I can only notice them in the vanity mirror, but I&#x27;m definitely growing hair everywhere especially more on my face.  Bottom line, this stuff will help you keep the hair you have, so it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I have not seen a difference in hair texture or growth since using this shampoo for two months. It does make a nice lather though.</li>
    <li> Hair became more manageable. Smell is awesome too. For sure I will try another bottle and let you know if there is a difference in length.</li>
    <li> Great product works well. Helps with thinning. Cant beat it for the price, I plan to leeps using. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. This is my first time trying a hair loss shampoo but I am so embarrassed about loosing my hair in handfuls sense i had my son 15 months ago, I had to try something. I am so glad I did. I have only used it twice so for because I just got it in the mail yesterday but I can already see results in the feeling of my hair and scalp. My scalp is not so dry and my hair feels smooth and swear it feels a little thicker. During my second wash I feel like less hair came out and so far today not so many hair is on my clothes. I fully intend on buying it again after this bottle runs out and I will be buying the conditioner and other products of this line.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Victoria Ruano</li>
    <li> The pump dispenser on this product was broken when it was delivered to me so I have to find a replacement cap from other plastic bottles to protect the shampoo. This product is very good so far. I like it that it is made in the USA. I am on my first bottle and in four weeks, I noticed it has strengthened the strands of my hair and I have seen new regrowth of hair stands on my scalp. I use it twice a week and I use a regular anti-dandruff shampoo in between. The smell of the product is alright. It doesn’t smell like chemicals.  I suggest to other potential users to use a good hair conditioner when trying this product since it can make you hair feel a bit dry.  I’m looking forward to the results in a few more weeks. I highly recommend this product, and will be using it as directed.</li>
    <li> This shampoo provides a renewed fresh feeling in my head and hair that makes me more confident and comfortable with the appearance of the growth. I&#x27;ve followed the directions closely to ensure that I could accurately provide feedback, and I&#x27;ve experienced less hair loss immediately. While the product is not a miracle or a cure all, it has definitely assisted in my hair remaining strong and vibrant, and far fewer follicles resting on my shoulders or in my hands after showering. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and will continue to explore the beneficial elements of this product.</li>
    <li> this product is great, the makers Ultrax labs have done thier home work only way this could be any better is when you use it with its partner found here:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Ultrax-Solace-Caffeine-Stimulating-Conditioner/dp/B009SUHZKQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr-mr-title&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is so good and its best ingredient Saw Palmetto. during the Clinical trials has shown that Saw Palmetto may block&lt;br /&gt;an enzyme,5-alpha-reductase, which facilitates the change of testosterone into DHT. DHT is considered a major cause for both&lt;br /&gt;male and female pattern baldness. which if you have done any research you would know this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what makes this product even better is if you not completely happy they have 100% satisfaction guarantee commitment.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is truly amazing. Used it twice and each time hair is getting better and better.  This is exactly what dry and brittle hair needs. Definitely recommend to anyone who is losing hair or just want to bring some life in thier hair.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my mom who has been having thinning hair, and she&#x27;s been using it for about a week and a half, and already we&#x27;re starting to notice some small results. Her hair does seem to be a bit fuller, and the amount of hair that comes off while blow drying is a little less. The results are not that crazy, but, after only a week and 1/2,it&#x27;s not too bad. The smell is actually quite pleasant as well.</li>
    <li> I always use shampoos for my hair but when i stumbled on this product i was amazed the difference it made on my hair. I noticed that my hair had a consistent growth. I experienced little to no hair loss by combing or breakage or lack of growth. I am amazed at the difference i saw using the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss product. It works and am glad i was introduced to this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now, and have noticed my hair is thicker, with hair beginning to grow around my temples.  I&#x27;ve tried many products to stop my thinning hair and regrow the hair around my temples.  BTW, you probably want to use it daily to get immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a winner!</li>
    <li> Smells good &amp; works as described. Noticed a difference right away.</li>
    <li> Just finished using the entire bottle.  Nice shampoo, lathers well and good smell.  I did not have any noticeable hair growth.</li>
    <li> The shampoo says that it will improve the thickness of my hair as well as replenish. My hair is already thick to begin with but it did improve the quality of my hair. My hair became smoother and looked more hydrated. Also, the shampoo smells amazing and the scent stays in my hair a very long time.  I would say this product is very good for hair recovery and overall helps you to have a healthy hair.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY IT, IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, TRUST ME. IF I KNEW,  I WOULD NOT BUY IT EVEN FOR $1 !!!</li>
    <li> I do not need my hair to be thicker, I need my hair to have more volume and be less dry. So I tried this shampoo after reading good review.  After using this shampoo, I felt my hair feeling hydrated and more fluffier.  In addition, I noticed less split ends. I also love how this shampoo smells.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. The shampoo thoroughly washed my hair and rinsed clean. I am noticing that the body of my hair is fuller and the texture of my hair is returning to its youthful look.  The ultra labs growth stimulating shampoo is doing the job. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have been trying to grow my hair out from a pixie haircut for some time &amp; even used the horse mane n tail stuff.  Anyway although I have not noticed much of growth,  it smells fabulous &amp; makes my hair so soft.  PS if using it for the 1 time it slow &amp; thick; not like shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I noticed that I was losing quite a bit of hair in the shower for the past few months. I was beginning to worry and since this product had such great reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I am so glad that I did! I have been following the bottle directions and the results are amazing. I have noticed a considerably less amount of thinning. I have also noticed that it makes my hair feel wonderfully soft and silky. Great product, would recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Using this and the conditioner has done so much for my hair! I love love love how soft it makes it!</li>
    <li> This seems to be working well to reduce the amount of shedding. It gives it an overall healthy feel with less breakage. My hair is thicker, healthier and less frizzy. This works well!</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy to see that this product worked for others. Surprised actually. This product has sodium lauryl sulfate which I wasn&#x27;t expecting given the price. And the product makes my hair frizzy. So I haven&#x27;t been able to continue the product. Frizzy hair that could possibly be thicker or smooth thinner hair. I chose smooth. If anyone knows a better product that works that doesn&#x27;t cause frizz and maybe create world peace because everyone would have fabulous hair, hit me up!</li>
    <li> First time user. I have very fine hair. Made my hair a little tangly, but once it dried off it looked like it had volume, with no product or hair dryer. I  The hair loss part of the product doesn&#x27;t seem to work any miracles, but I am sure it works for some people.</li>
    <li> My hair was growing so slowly after my I completed chemo. I have had chemo in the past and my hair growth was very quick so I was discouraged to see that it was taking so long this time. I began using Hair Surge and within 1 week you could barely see my scalp!! It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all and there is no irritation on my skin. I even put in on my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the price to see results. I already see progress within 4 days. I highly recommend to anyone looking for hair products to strengthen and hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> Got this product from a friend, and I love it so far. The pump handle is a nice touch, it feels nice on the scalp and whips into a graet lather easily. It also feels very &#x27;stimulating&#x27; and I like smell too!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic! It smells great and since using this product I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less shedding/loss in the shower. No more clogging the drain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started seeing results after the first week and my hair feels stronger and fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again after this bottle runs out. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This does not make good suds but it&#x27;s ok...it does make your hair look fuller and it also has a nice smell. Probably would have been better had I got the conditioner with it...but it is expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! My hair is thicker and fuller than ever. It even has a nice scent. Anybody looking to have healthier, better hair, buy this shampoo. You will NOT be disappointed! I will definitely be buying another bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this as a treatment. More than a shampoo. Once I message the shampoo into my scalp and let it sit while I wash. Them shampoo with my regular shampoo. I am hoping it will make a difference. So far so good. Only on my 1st bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair getting thinner over the years, and I finally decided I needed to do something. There&#x27;s a ton of hair growth products out there, but since I really didn&#x27;t know which one worked, I went to my local hair salon for a professional&#x27;s opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, they told me about the hair growth shampoo and conditioner from Ultrax was going to actually make the biggest difference (they had other brands, but this one was the best). The lady at the salon said it&#x27;s the caffeine that stimulates the hair follicles to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started using it 5+ times a week. Then 2 weeks in, I noticed my roots growing out thicker, and some baby hairs near the front! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now, and I just have to say, it really works!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Just got out of the shower and my hair smells and looks great.  I would recommend this product that is sick of chemical smelling hair growth shampoos.  This is a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was skeptic when I placed my order for Ultrax Labs Shampoo..... but how my hair looks and feels even after my first shampooing...I&#x27;m fixin&#x27; to order another bottle for back-up because I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair with anything else ever again!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just past my bra strap in length, poker straight and fine. I color treat my hair at home and in the salon...always shades of blonde.&lt;br /&gt;Last night, after several hours in the sun and pool, plus a few hours of sweating from working out and cleaning the house....my hair was, definitely, dirty.&lt;br /&gt;I only used five pumps of the shampoo and massaged for the recommended two minutes. The scent is hard to pinpoint, but the best I can describe is to say it&#x27;s clean and fresh. I admit that I tend to think more is always better and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather with that overflowing of bubbly suds, but..... WOW!!! I was so impressed with how clean I could feel my hair getting still. Even better was the volume I could, actually, feel while massaging it through my hair. I let it sit for about ten more minutes before rinsing. I always rinse in warm water and then do a final rinse in cool, so I stuck with this same routine. I continued my same routine of gently and lightly drying, and wrapping up in a towel for a handful of minutes then in a hair clip till I apply my makeup..then I comb and style, etc. Usually, no matter how I style my hair (up or down) I have to tease it all over because it&#x27;s so fine. I couldn&#x27;t believe how full my hair felt and looked and I was soooo happy I didn&#x27;t even have to tease it at all. That alone will save my hair from breakage and damage. I didn&#x27;t have any brassy tones in my blonde hair, either. The ABSOLUTE BEST part was when my boyfriend picked me up for our date last night....the first thing he said, &amp;#34;Belle! Your hair looks GORGEOUS!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;PS He&#x27;s never complimented my hair!</li>
    <li> What a great product! I use this shampoo every day and on some occasions, twice. The biggest noticeable difference is how it leaves the scalp in a better condition. My hair feels better and I can feel it become thicker in some areas. There is also small improvement in terms of shedding less hair which is what it is intended for. I will look into similar products from this company.</li>
    <li> I have been through many products who promise the same thing but ultra labs has my hair feeling healthier and I can see plenty of new growth. I&#x27;m sure to purchase more. This product is great.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, so many people have issues with hair loss these days and can&#x27;t seem to find the solution. Look no further, this product provides the answers to your problems. A pleasant aroma that you can instantly feel working right away. No harmful chemicals so that&#x27;s a big plus and the amount you get in a bottle last quite a long time. I can definitely see myself purchasing this product regularly. Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine is lightning in a bottle that lights up all the right places, no regrets what so ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ultra Labs Hair Surge together with Ultra Labs Hair Maxx supplements and I am very pleased.  Not only does my hair feel thicker and fuller but, it also looks healthier and is so soft! My hair is very fine and curly and I&#x27;m happy not too see clumps of it coming out when I brush. I just reordered my Hair Maxx and will do the same with this shampoo as soon as I run out.</li>
    <li> Great product! Received on time. Very satisfied with the services and I recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> Ultrax shampoo wins again!  This shampoo has caffeine which stimulates hair follicles and makes my hair feel smooth and clean, it has essential oils but does not feel greasy or weigh my hair down.  It helps to thicken the hair I have and the caffeine stimulates my scalp, I&#x27;ve been seeing less breakage and less hair in my brush, I believe this is working and will continue to use daily! (as recommended) make sure you leave it on for 2-5 minutes so it has a chance to work!</li>
    <li> I was talking to my hair dresser about my thinning hair and she recommended I try this product.  I was skeptical at first.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  I have had thin hair all of my life and I have not been kind to my hair.  Color, perms, highlights - everything you can imagine.  This product has given my hair more body than I have ever had.  My hair is actually thicker and fuller after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell funny or leave your head tingling like some of the other products I have tried in the past. Well worth the price.  I would recommend it to anyone trying to rejuvenate their hair from all the damage of processing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, no gloves or special processing needed.  I was happy to see that the regrowth component was caffeine, not an unrecognizable chemical.  Caffeine has been proven effective in anti-aging and cell rejuvenation in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to have found some help before my hair got too thin.</li>
    <li> I am so worried about losing my hair.  I have a well advanced receding hair line and with each passing year I know it&#x27;s going to get worse.  So I decided to halt the hair line from disappearing and started to try some products  - mainly shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this product to try - pretty fast shipping.  I received it in 2 days.  I had tried other products and was disappointed before so I did not have my hopes up too high. After about 5 days of use the one thing I did notice, since I have fine hair, is it did thicken my hair.  I felt like my hair was fuller , almost like I had a head full of hair.  It was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging and the smell of the product was pleasant to me.  It has caffeine in it to stimulate the scalp so I wanted to see how my scalp felt and it was surprisingly clean and fresh.  I will be purchasing more of the product when I run out.  I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Its alot of satisfied customers im going to order this product very pleased by the reviews</li>
    <li> Got this product for my dad, he is balding, He has used this several times before and he swears that it works on him. He says that it makes new hair come in and shrinks his bald spot!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a definite must-have if you&#x27;re suffering from thinning hair. The shampoo itself smells good and does not possess that \\&quot;chemically enhanced\\&quot; scent like the other shampoos that target hair thinning. It leaves my scalp feeling tingly and clean after shampooing! Im a fan of Ultrax!</li>
    <li> After a couple of weeks of use, I noticed a difference in amount of shedding (I am used to finding my black hair all around my apt). Its been several weeks now and I can also see a difference in growth rate and texture! I&#x27;m excited to see the results with continued use in the upcoming weeks!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I have always had very thick, full hair. Unfortunately, life got stressful (as it does) and my hair has been looking dull and limp for weeks, and the winter weather isn&#x27;t helping any, I&#x27;m sure. This shampoo is pricey, but deservedly so! My hair looks fuller, healthier, and even shinier! There isn&#x27;t much of a lather, but I discovered long ago that lather doesn&#x27;t equal a quality product. I quite like the smell, too. All in all, I think this will be my go-to for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using the ultrax hair stimulating shampoo consistently for about 2 months (5 days a week as directed). I can say that I am very pleased with this product. It was recommended by a male co-worker who also had good results, so I decided to give it a try. I have colored and heat-treated my hair multiple times over the past few years and noticed significant thinning and damage and more hair falling out in the shower or when brushed… was looking for something reliable and I definitely can tell that this product has helped get my hair back to what it used to be, especially how thick it used to be. The combination of caffeine and essential oils were effective and I give the product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for my hair. I noticed a a change in the texture of my hair. It looks and feels great. I don&#x27;t have any hair loss problems but I do notice my hair growing back thicker and quicker.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Not sure how this product get so many 5 star ratings, but I&#x27;m pretty sure they weren&#x27;t from people who actually paid for and used this product. Save yourself $20 and get a three month&#x27;s supply of the Target brand version of Rogaine</li>
    <li> This product is great I works just fine. the shampoo has a wonderful aroma and it gives you a great feeling thru out your hair and it gives it shine and gives you that bounce feeling after.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo.  In just the first few days I noticed less shedding, cleaner feeling hair and my scalp felt good.  After three weeks of use, I can see tons of baby hairs growing out!  This shampoo has a nice fresh scent and not overpowering.  This hair loss shampoo far exceeds my expectations and I would highly recommend investing in this product for hair loss.  Excellent all the way around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so soft, my hair that is. It helped my damaged hair, felt it on the first try. Came early and I love the care they took. It lasted me so long. It made my hair grow so fast. It&#x27;s amazing for the price it has. I wish I could smell it but by the time my cold was gone so was my shampoo. Im ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews, but this shampoo is great! You feel the tingling sensation from the shampoo right away, it&#x27;s been about a week and my hairline looks visibly fuller! Excited to see more results!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best shampoo that I have ever bought. It really works! I have been using this product for just a little while and I am already seeing great results. I don&#x27;t have to use much of it, so I don&#x27;t run out of it so quickly. It gives my hair a beautiful shine and luster and works well with my other hair products. My hair has improved dramatically from using this product and I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to thicken their hair, or just needs a great shampoo!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is an excellent product for stimulating hair growth.  When used regularly preferably 5 times a week, not only do you get thicker fuller hair but you reinforce the effectiveness of maximum hair growth stimulation along with no hair loss. Lets say you use the ultrax vitamin supplement and hair lush products and experience hair growth.  Then you use a different shampoo and wash out any new hair growth.  It&#x27;s like one step forward, two steps backwards. This growth stimulating shampoo eliminates that problem. It will still work well as a stand alone product even if you are not using other ultrax labs hair growth products.  I highly recommend it as a regular shampoo regimen.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy it!! It doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of my money regret it. Its so harmfull look at the ingredients so bad</li>
    <li> All reviews are fake they all have done by owner or product manufacturers see the picture below same review different person name ... Made mistake hmmmm now my review gone disappear</li>
    <li> Reluctantly, (due to the price) i decided to try this after I had a bad chemical treatment done to my hair &amp; it started coming out A LOT every time I combed it ! :-( But after using this product, after the 1st wash or two, I noticed all of the shedding slowed down dramatically!  :-) I think with continued use of it, it won&#x27;t be long before my hair is back to its usual fullness! ! I really expected it to smell like a medicine cabinet,  but it doesn&#x27;t at all !!! :-) Great product!  I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has an amazing rich texture to it and you can really feel a difference right away.&lt;br /&gt;You get a kind of a minty refreshing feeling all over your hair, plus your hair gets revitalized with a unique and delicious scent.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair loss shampoo out there! It works wonders to keep shedding at bay, and I have actually noticed my hair become thicker since I began using it!</li>
    <li> I tried this product based on recommendations from my brother-in-law. He really enjoys the product. At times I´ve experienced less hair loss and at other the same or more. I guess it´s more of how stressed you are. But I´ll go with the positive feedback on this product and keep on using it.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!! Cleans the hair the best and since using this I stopped using head and shoulders. No more itchy scalp. Now I see that it was the chemicals causing the itch. I will use nothing else.</li>
    <li> I was very scared when I started losing hair and then someone recommended me this product. I havent been using it for 3 months and I have a full head of hair now!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for altering hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo contains hair loss fighting ingredients such as caffeine and ketoconozole. Feels great when massaged on scalp and leaves no residue. It smells great and lathers and cleans well. I have noticed growth and less hair loss during washing, highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Less than 2 weeks and I already saw a noticeable difference in my hair. It was shedding less, which was a relief! Would recommend this product to anyone and will certainly be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Ultrax is amazing! I used other iteams for my balding hair and nothing worked. Buy Ultrax is working great I can really see some hair coming back and haven&#x27;t had any hair fall out since I started useing it. Would recommend to family and friends or anyone looking for something that really does work continuously!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous shampoos that claim to restore or promote hair growth but none have come close to this shampoo, which backs up everything it claims to do. After using this product for several weeks I have seen a noticeable difference in my hair as it has started to grow back faster than any of the other products I have used in the past. If you are looking for a shampoo that promotes hair regrowth as good if not better than any other product on the market, this is for you.</li>
    <li> There are no words to describe how great this product works.  I saw results within the first week.  I recommend this product to everyone who is thinning or going bald.</li>
    <li> Great product. And great value.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for me, after a long time of shaving my head in the army I realized that my hairline had started to recede some. After trying another caffeinated shampoo (Dove Mens) and really enjoying the stimulating feeling during my morning shower, I decided to try this one and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed. It at least seems like my hair line is stationary. Coincidentally, my wife started using it and so far the shower drain has stayed relatively unclogged. I know it may be too early to say for sure what&#x27;s working, but it certainly feels great and as far as I can tell is keeping my hair loss at bay. I have a feeling that this is the one, and I&#x27;m definitely going to stick with this one. My wife wanted me to throw in that she&#x27;s definitely happy with it as well, and is seeing a very significant increase in fullness and thickness.</li>
    <li> I am a very healthy and active woman who eats clean and works out daily. You can only imagine how I felt when the girl known for her massive beautiful curls started to notice my hair just lost its va voom. I&#x27;ve tried many other volumizing or growth stimulating products without any results. I&#x27;m a bit over a month in now and everyone(including me) notices my hair improving. Anyone who is looking for a product that WORKS... look no more!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that works right away. The first time I used it, I can feel a big difference how my hair feels and looks. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell to it, and the texture is good. My hair was starting to get thin and using this shampoo helps it stop getting thin. I just love how it makes my hair feels after washing and blowing it out. It&#x27;s must have product if you are suffering from hair loss, thinning and breakage.</li>
    <li> I continued shedding with this product until i switched to nioxin 2 then it stopped shedding. I now use this product for my travelling shampoo snd stack it with noxin</li>
    <li> This product has really given my hair so much life! I recognized many of the ingredients and they have been proven to aid in hair growth. There are so many benefits to using this shanpoo. 1 you can feel the tingling sensation in the 2 minutes its on your scalp. 2 your hair will not dry out even if you have curly hair. 3 your hair and scalps feels cool clean and refreshed. 4 The best part... It stimulates hair growth!! As for the shampoo it has a pleasant smell and lathers up nicely..  Reguardless, If you suffer from thinning hair or just want more length and fullness..This is the ticket!!</li>
    <li> As I usually am with these kinds of products, I was extremely skeptical at first. My father has experienced shedding and hair loss with age and asked me to help him find a product that could help rectify that. After thoroughly browsing our options, we were pleased by a lot of positive feedback for this product so we decided to give it a try. We remained skeptical but after a while there was no denying his shedding has declined greatly. We even noticed hair growth in areas where he has been balding. It takes a lot to make my father believe in products like this but he seems much happier and confident since using it the recommended 5 days a week. That’s really all we could want from a product such as this.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a good shampoo for my thin,fine hair.This shampoo pumps it up without weighing it down. I am also glad the scent is nice and light and not a heavy flowery smell.</li>
    <li> nice texture,great consistence and i love the way it smells! It also does work! My father in law was using it and says he sees the difference comparing to other products.&lt;br /&gt;I think is worth the money.Hope that helps.Definitely will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! To begin, the company, Ultrax Labs offer a 90-day money back guarantee -- that&#x27;s unheard of in this day and age, and speaks volumes about their confidence in their product. Another thing that jumps out is it&#x27;s one of the few caffeinated shampoos (more on that in a minute) that is formulated for both men and women. There are three key ingredients in this shampoo: caffeine, which research shows can extend the life of the hair follicle by decreasing the release of the hormone DHT, which suppresses the growth of hair follicles. Ketoconazole, an anti-fungal to help control dandruff, but has also been found in a study published in the Journal of Dermatology to stimulate hair growth. And, finally, Saw Palmetto, which is used to block an enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT. If you want to halt hair loss and stimulate hair growth, go with natural ingredients that this shampoo offers over other products that are full of chemicals!</li>
    <li> Hair Surge is made in the USA so that was a plus for me as I prefer my money to support our economy. The product is clear and has a smell kind of like an energy drink (not floral or perfume like at all). The shampoo feels more like a gel then most shampoos I normally use.  Keeping it in for 2 min isn&#x27;t bad, I use a kitchen timer to make sure I leave it in the right amount of time. No point spending good money and not follow instructions. I have positive results, my hair looks thicker and feels great, my girlfriend who is looking over my shoulder as I write also agrees, lol. If you do choose to give this a try I highly recommend that you follow the instructions and I personally use it every day.</li>
    <li> Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank u very mucht</li>
    <li> I think I might&#x27;ve previously reviewed that this shampoo works wonders for dandruff, but wasn&#x27;t sure about hair-loss. I still don&#x27;t think it makes new hair grow, but I think it does do a good job in slowing down the hair-loss. I recently switched to the Nioxin set because I wanted to try and save money and it was ranked well, and now I see how well the Hair Surge was working. With the Nioxin, my hair is falling out like crazy. Even though hair surge is a little spendy, I&#x27;m going to switch back to it before I lose even more hair.</li>
    <li> Holy crap. You definitely feel it, and you know it&#x27;s working. My hair feels amazing, and looks amazing. The smell isn&#x27;t bad like other hair loss shampoos, and it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty at all. Points also for it being Made in USA.</li>
    <li> Before I started this shampoo my hair was shedding rapidly and my scalp was constantly itchy in the places where I was noticing hair loss. Since I&#x27;ve been using this and hair solace conditioner the itching and shedding has stopped, and hair is thicker at the front of my scalp where it was receding. No new hair has grown back but luckily I started using this before I had any significant hair loss.</li>
    <li> I was very doubtful before buying this product, since i bought too many in the past. I got it yesterday and use it ONLY 1 TIME. I don t know if it s only me or what but it was a MIRACLE. Of course i didn t get new hair (im beginning with hair loss on my crown) but the hair get so much volume and especially very, very silky and soft (something i couldn t find with the entire pharmacy that i bought in the past).&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy and hoping to find more good news on the future. I am using it with the conditioner of the same brand and a regular minoxidil solution.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my itchy scalp and increasing hair loss issues. After about five or so weeks of use, I still have a bit of itching (much less, tho) and today I found ZERO hair in the shower drain !! Since the hubby had even remarked at how much hair he&#x27;d notice in the shower, this has really impressed me. I&#x27;m still looking for something to help with the itching though.&lt;br /&gt;Before I started this shampoo my hair was shedding rapidly and my scalp was constantly itchy in the places where I was noticing hair loss. Since I&#x27;ve been using this and the Ultrax conditioner the itching and shedding has stopped, and hair is thicker at the front of my scalp where it was receding. So far no new hair has grown back but luckily I started using this before I had any significant hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in my hair loss each time I have used the product. I just wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product I&#x27;ve ever used on my thin baby fine hair. It looks and feels like I have double the amount of hair as I had before using it. I have never been happier with a product. Might try their conditioner as well here shortly</li>
    <li> I love this product,l love the smell,the lather of this product,wow!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product I have only been using it a little while but already have seen amazing results including hair shine, fuller head of hair, and shocking looks and compliments on my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this product to friends and family and even strangers wow what a difference......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try this product amazing......</li>
    <li> Innovative product. 100% recommended,  and fast shipping. Have you ever you had loss your hair? You can to stimulate growth. This product applies perfectly for you. I recommend use it and  to try and see effective result you must apply it the right way and have the results you expect. This product help to grow and wash their hair.  It the best. And the smell is bubble gum.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I&#x27;ve damaged it more than I&#x27;d like to admit. ...daily blow drying and flat ironing. I also most recently used a few box dyes and have been terrified that my hair would shed down to nothing. I received this shampoo in 2 days and have already used it twice. My boyfriend said my hair is noticeably shinier and softer. Maybe I&#x27;m going crazy but I could softer wear my hair is shedding less in just a few days of using it. From the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I almost can&#x27;t wait to wake up and wash my hair with this everyday. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be seeing more and more results!</li>
    <li> I am totally obsessed with this shampoo. It works unbelievably well and I love the smell! It smells soooo good. I am loosing way less hair when I shower and practically none when I brush! I can&#x27;t believe changing my shampoo has made such a difference with hair loss but it fully has. Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a tennis ball sized area on my scalp that was extremely thin, barely any hair. After using this product for about 2 weeks I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will look like after a few more weeks. Also, my hair used to shed so much and it has really come to almost a complete stop. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> I loved it the first I used it. It made my hair super soft and smooth...but after a couple of use I feel like my hair is still shedding. And the bottle is too small for it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I used the Ultrax Hair Surge shampoo for 5 days as recommended and it really works in terms of adding volume to my hair.  It&#x27;s actually humid today and yet my hair is full, making my hair look thicker.  So the shampoo must be working, which is great because my hair has been falling out on a daily basis.  I recommend you use conditioner after shampooing.</li>
    <li> After using this product religiously in hopes of regaining lost hair, I have discovered the real magic behind how this shampoo works. This shampoo targets scalp health by nourishing the skin and providing the best opportunity for hair regrowth to occur. In short, this allows more, and stronger hair follicles to develop. I have noticed am overall increase in volume over the weekend, and I anticipate that my hair growth will only continue to get better. Great product, would definitely recommend for people looking for scalp and hair follicle help!</li>
    <li> Very happy, delivery was fast. When I wash my hair, ooh my.... I&#x27;m the kind of person that like hair full and healthy without the extension or wig, I like it all natural. I came across this and I decided to buy it to get my hair to grow not only longer but fuller, when I wash my hair with this you can see from the first time you used it how soft your hair gets, My thoughts was ok I like it, but when I flow dry my hair I could really see the dramatic changed this shampoo made, ( the same day )even my daughter noticed and told me wow mommy your is so glossy and shiny.Before this my hair was dry and has split ends. I didn&#x27;t buy it for this but now I know why you hair growth, if you have healthy hair/scalp your hair is more likely to grow, I know this because I went to a cosmetology school and all hair experts knows this is the way you get your hair to grow. I&#x27;m so happy because I&#x27;m letting my hair growth longer, but I don&#x27;t only want that I also want my hair to look healthy, and without me knowing this is doing a better job than I thought. If you don&#x27;t have hair lost problem at least buy it to restore you hair I can say this is the best champoo I have ever try on my curly dry hair. I will keep you updated about my hair growing results. I gave a 5 for the results I&#x27;m already getting. I highly recommend it.  I put a pic after the flow dry, my hair is curly and see how I got it. :)      Ok, two weeks after hair is getting longer and full, I had to get a hair trim today since  is growing so fast,  my hair is still looking shiny and healthy, don&#x27;t get me wrong I still want my hair to grow long, is just the hair trim you have to get at least every 3 month, with this champoo you have to get it sooner. :)  I still highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product despite its price,It is expensive but you get what you pay for. And this product definitely does what it is intended to do and some more. Prior to the purchase of this product I was losing  my hairs .After doing some research I bought this product.In just 2 weeks of applying this product everyday, I felt the effect of this product. You have to keep using the product for few months to get the best results. I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss solutions, but this one really delivers . This product really helped me regain my self-confidence. I have recommended it to a few of my friends, who were also experiencing devastating hair lost. Needless to say, it worked just as well on them if not better than me.</li>
    <li> Success! After bleaching my hair a few times this summer, I was left with a thin patch by my baby hair. Have been looking for a solution to this for a while. Really happy that this product works.</li>
    <li> First of all, the smell of this product is great. It leaves my hair smelling really good and feeling fuller than it was before I started using this product. I have felt a difference in my hair with just one wash and look forward to seeing more results by continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> Miracle in a BOTTLE! I LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve finally found a hair product that actually WORKS! Within 2wks I started noticing less hair loss in the shower. I use it 3 times a week and it lasts me a month in a half! Worth every penny. After a month in a half I notice thickness, growth, and shine!</li>
    <li> My never-ending search to find what I would consider the best shampoo for my hair is what led me to this magnificent product. I routinely use several shampoo brands at any given time depending on the condition of my hair. I use one type of shampoo if my hair is dry hair, and another if it&#x27;s oily. So I was stunned to discover that an over the counter shampoo might be the answer to my fairly recent hair thinning and slow growth issues. I have had long healthy hair for years, and last year noticed some thinning in the front on the scalp, as well as hair breakage in various places, some severe. And if that weren&#x27;t enough, my hair seemed to be growing more slowly than ever before, so I knew it was time to do something. I began using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo about 30 days ago, and after 12 shampoos, the excessive breakage has stopped, and thinning hair on the scalp has started to fill in a bit. It hasn&#x27;t all filled in at this stage, but I&#x27;m fairly confident all of it will. After sharing my experiences with a friend about Hair Surge, we got into a friendly debate as to why the product works. One of us thinks it is because it minimizes hair breakage and strengthens the hair which leads to longer hair, and the other suggests Hair Surge stimulates the scalp to rejuvenate old hair follicle cells to grow new hair. I quite think the product does a bit of both. All debating aside, the bottom line is when I inspect my scalp where the thinning is prevalent, I now see hairs coming up where there were none before. And I probably wouldn&#x27;t have believed this were possible had I not added Hair Surge to my weekly shampoo routine and experienced results first hand. Anyone truly interested in evaluating the product shouldn&#x27;t debate its effectiveness, they should try it for themselves. Because we all know our own hair and scalp better than anyone, even the most subtle changes in hair growth will be detected, making debate about the products effectiveness irrelevant. My next step is totry Utrax Labs&#x27; Hair Solace Conditioner, it too is packed with caffeine, and other active ingredients that encourage hair growth. If I enjoy the results, I will include it in my daily hair care routine as I have the Hair Surge Shampoo.</li>
    <li> great product works very well and has a large amunt of product for so little money.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo. It&#x27;s very stimulating to my scalp and I have definitely noticed less shedding since I have been using it. My hair definitely feels thicker and has more body. It rinses very clean as well. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband who&#x27;s hair has been rapidly thining over the last few years. Product arrived very quickly and descreetly. My husband used the shampoo five days a week; for the first couple of weeks and noticed small hairs begin to grow at about the two week mark. He decreased use to three days a week and continues to see improvement with thickness and regrowth in the areas that he was thining. We are very pleased with the product deliverables and will continue to purchase this regrowth serum as part of our regular routine.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to see if it would help with the thickness of my hair. About 9 months ago, I stopped a medication because of a side effect of hair loss. It wasn&#x27;t extreme, but I definitely noticed a change in my hair, like it was getting thinner. Since I&#x27;ve stopped taking the medication, my hair hasn&#x27;t bounced back. So, I gave this shampoo a shot. As some others have mentioned, the shampoo is really thick, like super thick. It doesn&#x27;t get real lathery/foamy like some shampoos. I left it in for about 2-3 minutes, as suggested, and rinsed it out. After I showered, I simply towel-dried and brushed my hair, nothing else. My hair dried so full and so thick, and has so much body, it&#x27;s unbelievable. It never looks like this normally. It usually just kinda hangs and is &amp;#34;blah,&amp;#34; and I usually keep it in a ponytail or bun as a result. When I put my hair in a ponytail now, it is a super full ponytail, and I could only put the rubber band around my hair twice and it was tight. Usually I need to do it three times. I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far, but my hair looks so thick and full, I have no complaints. I&#x27;ve never seen these kinds of results from just a shampoo before. Definitely happy with it.</li>
    <li> Quick disclaimer: the price seems steep especially for an 8 oz. bottle but remember this isn&#x27;t just run of the mill shampoo and conditioner, this helps stimulate hair growth so I was slightly sympathetic about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thicker hair so I find my self using more shampoo but on a 3-4 day basis instead of 5 times a week.  I can tell there&#x27;s hair growth and small roots at the peak of my skull (as I rubbed my fingers through my scalp and felt soft small hairs compared to the 3-4&#x27;&#x27; strands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product leaves an Ajax/Dawn aroma (for me).  Occasionally the lathering is a bit inconsistent. Despite what I&#x27;ve heard through reviews and peers this shampoo was under whelming in its results, maybe it could be my hair type.  I had my father use some and his results are modest as well (by the way we&#x27;re both African-American males).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for hair growth stimulants give this shampoo a try, but if you&#x27;re younger  (under 30) with very thick hair this may not be for you.</li>
    <li> Smells and lathers much better than others I have tried.  I use it 4x per week with no problems.  Also, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair and I can use a normal amount of conditioner.  My scalp feels refreshed and relaxed and rejuviated.</li>
    <li> Great to thicken hair , love it</li>
    <li> Wow this actually works i highly recommend this good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This stuff was so expensive I had higher hopes for it. It smells medicinal and left the tub really oily. Feels like it leaves some sort of film on your hair, maybe making it seem fuller when dry. I just don&#x27;t like the stuff. Aveda now makes a product for thinning hair that I think I&#x27;ll try instead.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. After using it for  the past couple of weeks my hair seems much fuller. When I am using the shampoo it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m washing my hair with hash chemicals. It&#x27;s simple to use, with no complicated instructions to follow. It&#x27;s not like normal shampoos, its very thick and doesn&#x27;t get very lathery but leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean. The shampoo removes the oil and grease from my hair and I don&#x27;t need to use any secondary products. My hair feels thicker and I&#x27;ve noticed new hair popping up where I had lost it.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was skeptical at first. As a former hairstylist, I am VERY particular about what hair care products I use. I must say, this is one of the best values for what it does that I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought that I would purchase a product designed to help grow hair. As I am now in my 30’s, I have noticed that my hair is not rebounding as well from the daily abuse I put it through. I have naturally curly hair, and like many I regularly straighten it. Not only have I noticed increasing breakage, but the little baby hairs no longer seem to ever grow. As I am not willing to admit my age in person yet, I wanted to find something that would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased the first time I used the product. I have tried a couple other salon brand products, but they seemed to always leave my hair either very dry or very oily. Not only did I feel my hair was incredibly clean, it felt good! I noticed an immediate difference in the amount of breakage I was finding, and those little baby hair actually seem to be getting longer, time will tell. Best part, in my mind, I’m noticing less frizz then normal on those days that my hair just won’t behave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shampoo itself, it has a very pleasant smell, but not overpowering. Very minty and fresh. Unlike similar products, I do not smell it all day, and no one else seems to be able to smell it. The consistency is nice and thick, with a good lather. Only thing I wish, would be that there not be sodium chloride, aka salt, as a filler in the product. Unfortunately, this strips away a straightening process I had done on my hair to help control it. I can live without that, but would love to see a version without that in it.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money. It does not work to better the hair rather it harms and makes scalp itchy. I strongly recommend not to use this product with expectation as it claims.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first, but this shampoo is definitely worth the money. Great lather and smells wonderful and it works too!!! I&#x27;ve noticed much less hair loss since using this shampoo. My hair feels thicker and fuller and I&#x27;ve noticed that there are no longer a hundred hairs on the bathroom floor when I brush my hair. I wish I would have found this shampoo sooner. Finally a product that does what it says it is going to do. The active ingredients in this product really work! Their scientific studies are obviously right!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo that&#x27;s very mildly scented and leaves no oily residue. It is very thick which makes it easy to lather as it requires you to leave it in your hair for several minutes before rinsing off. The minimal fragrance leaves your scalp feeling extremely refreshed and balanced. It also gives your hair more volume after just several uses. After a few weeks of almost daily use there will be a noticeable improvement in minimizing hair loss. Overall, it is a great daily shampoo with the added advantage of improving hair volume and density.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical to try this shampoo because of the price, but let me tell you all- it is WORTH IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 21 yr old woman with a large forehead because my hairline seems to already be receding, but after using this shampoo a few times my hair appears to be a lot fuller in my temple areas, which makes my forehead look smaller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is for people who need it- people with thinning hair or receding hairlines. If you have those problems, this product will work miracles for you!</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is awesome! It smells wonderful and I am starting to see new hair growth Already in a matter of just a few weeks!!!! I would definitely purchase this again and I am buying about 3 bottles for people that I know for Christmas presents! How great to be able to give the gift of hair growth to the people you love?! Wow!</li>
    <li> I have just started to use this product, I do have dry thin hair with some problems with dryness on my scalp, so wondered about this product, but  I have used it several times, and really like the way my hair looks, it looks healthy.  I&#x27;m not sure yet about the regrowth, but I have been using this with the conditioner, and lush treatment, and my hair is easier to manage now.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product! I heard about this shampoo from my hairdresser because I had a ton of hair loss after I had my son. I started using it and within weeks it became obvious that it was working! I wasn&#x27;t collecting clumps of hair after I brushed or when I showered. My hair started to thicken up and became the full, thick hair I had always had before baby! My hubby started to use it, too. He takes Rx meds for hair loss and this has worked so well in keeping his hair from thinning. It&#x27;s awesome and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results!</li>
    <li> The shampoo states that you will see an improvement in hair quality, thickness, and scalp vitality in the first use. I was a little skeptical, but after my first time using the shampoo, my hair does FEEL healthier. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be bogged down with all the chemical products when I use other shampoos; instead, my hair feels light and full of life. The shampoo has a kind of lemon-y scent to it, but it isn&#x27;t strong. The only pitfall I have with this product is the lather ratio: there isn&#x27;t much lather to it, but at the same time, other shampoos probably add a lot of extra things just to get the lather going. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product, and I can&#x27;t wait to reap the benefits after weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Product shipped within 12 hours! Excellent customer service! I cannot wait to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic bargain!</li>
    <li> Very surprised at how effective this shampoo is. This was one of many attempts I used with similar  products and this is by far the best.  Would recommend to friends and family</li>
    <li> Wow!i really love this shampoo, my hair is cleaner healthier, more manageable just after only 1 use, I am so much pleased with this shampoo because my hair was shedding and thinning ,my hair is now more softer and it also shines, the price was excellent, not to expensive like the other products, and it also came fast I didn&#x27;t have to wait a long time, I my friend also has ordered her shampoo after I refered this one to her I am sure she will love the shampoo also, Thank you so Much!</li>
    <li> Approaching 37 and noticing lots of hair in the drain and in the brush.  My friend had a bottle of this she gave me because she is allergic to peppermint (this has peppermint oil in it) and it worked pretty well, so this will be my second bottle.  I found that this shampoo will not change your DNA (baldness due to genetics) but will improve your hair enormously as far as strength, volume, and keeping the hair you have.  It does grow new hair, because I noticed baby hair growing around where my hair starts at my forehead.  It filled in the top around that area too.  I like to shampoo my hair first with a regular shampoo then using this for its benefits.  The reason I do so is because this shampoo is very thick and hard to get a super-sudsy lather.  This shampoo will make your scalp tingle because of some of the ingredients.  As I mentioned, it contains peppermint oil.  It also has menthol and niacin in it, which will give you a tingling sensation.  So don&#x27;t be scared if you feel that!  The smell is a pleasant minty type scent.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair overall is much thicker.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the hair really growing in or because this shampoo gives you texture.  But I know it works because there is so much less hair in my brush.  It is a little pricy, but so are salon shampoos, and you really just pay for the names of those.  At least you get a benefit from this shampoo.  As a lady, I recommend this shampoo to other gals especially ones with fine hair like me.  Your hair WILL become thicker and stronger!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks. Unlike most hair growth shampoos that only focus on the regrowth, this shampoo also acts like a normal shampoo. While it seems that it&#x27;s hair growth stiimulation is working great, the best part is that you dont sacrifice the properties  of a great shampoo for hair growth properties. Overall , the shampoo works just as advertised. It helps with hair regrowth, while still giving you the shine and lush that you would expect from a $40 shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been losing hair slowly and steadily over the past 10 years, top is getting very thin;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started using this and also taking the supplement from the same manufacture, it&#x27;s been a couple of months and I now see new short hair coming out, but they look very thin though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very hopeful, I think it&#x27;s working, though I dont really know if it is the shampoo or the supplement.</li>
    <li> Bought this product recently for my father, at his request. He is 57 years old had been balding significantly on the top the past few years and what&#x27;s left had all but turned gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s been using this shampoo once a day for about two weeks now and he is definitely starting to get some fuzz back, and it&#x27;s growing in dark brown as his natural hair color. The graying on the sides also seems to be getting darker, probably because of the natural color roots starting to fill in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s had no complaints about it, he was wary at first as he tried a hair growth shampoo earlier this year that caused an adverse reaction but after reading the reviews and doing his own due diligence he decided to give it a shot and has been happy with it thus far. Aside from the growth-related benefits, he did note this shampoo is comparable to his usual shampoo, leaving his hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this rate he might just have a full head of hair again by the time he reaches the end of the bottle! We&#x27;ll see what happens!</li>
    <li> I read the review and was hoping for success! I started using it and after a little over a week the hair on front is falling out incredibly fast! How do I know? Number one I can see it and number two the amount of hair in my shower drain has NEVER been more!&lt;br /&gt;With a crazy cold winter I am feeling a draft on my head. This is the ONLY change I have made over the past weeks since using it!&lt;br /&gt;The label says NOTHING about helping to keep you from losing hair or hair regrowth. The label and the description don&#x27;t match!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and condition are the dynamic duo to speed hair loss!</li>
    <li> As used as directed, on the scalp 2-5 mins, and using 5 times a week. There has been definite improvement of my hair. I instantly notice less hair loss and after a couple of weeks of use saw new hair growth coming in! I recommend for others to try!!</li>
    <li> I have a thyroid disorder called Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis.  I have looked for a product that would help with the loss of hair I have had due to my condition.  Ultrax Labs Hair Surge is just what I needed.  It comes in a nice package and is easy to use.  I&#x27;m excited about the results I am achieving with this shampoo.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell and its effects. Now my hair seems nice after a week of usage. I am really pleased by purchase, hope it will solve my hair loss problem too.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for under a week so I will review again later but so far not bad. Definitely feel as though my hair is stimulated and refreshed scalp</li>
    <li> First off, it arrived much sooner than anticipated which is always nice.  As for the shampoo itself, it was quite invigorating, and gave a tingling sensation along my scalp especially where I&#x27;m balding. I started with a clean shave before using the the shampoo, and can tell my hair has grown back much quicker than its normal pace.</li>
    <li> This product works great and it smells great too!! Very pleased with the results!!</li>
    <li> Smells a little funky, but my hair does look thicker ;) Would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have really slow growing hair that I have been trying to get long for a whole year and it is still just to my shoulder blades; so needless to say I was becoming very frustrated. When I came across this product I was just DYING to try it out. I am so glad I did too, because even though I have only been using it a few weeks, I have noticed a difference. My hair seems fuller, longer and softer. Softer is very exciting to me because I have curly hair that I straighten everyday and it has become coarse over the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry hair that tends to break a lot, or stubborn hair that refuses to grow any faster. It smells really good, like Dr. Pepper, and it really works! The shampoo is thicker than most, so make sure you put a liberal amount in your palm so that it covers all of your hair. Let it sit for a while too, it needs to soak in to your follicles. I did it a few times a week, and it worked just as well as if you do it every day, so don&#x27;t feel like you gotta go nuts for fast results.</li>
    <li> This shampoo assures that you have thick hair that is silky smooth. It works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this shampoo and I am still thanking her, It&#x27;s been two weeks and I can see hair beginning to sprout when I look closely at my scalp. This shampoo has a great lather and crisp clean smell, my hair remains light weight with no waxy build up. I looked around and did some comparative pricing. In hind sight i&#x27;d have to say no matter the price difference you get what you pay for with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with off and on hair loss for the last year. I have tried several products but none that had the right ingredients. This stimulating shampoo really stimulates the scalp and makes your hair feel refresh. I am also drinking a obit of water which might be helping the healing of the scalp. I have notice a change and so are my friends and family. What makes me feel good about this process is not only is my hair growing back it&#x27;s starting too look healthy and shiny. No more split ends, dry scalp and hair falling out in the shower.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I&#x27;v been using this product for just 30 days and I&#x27;m seeing a big difference.It&#x27;s like my a miracle in a bottle. Enjoy! Guaranteed to put a smile on your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo  shampoo for a couple of times when I found its amazing effects on my hair and hair growth. A gentle and throughout cleaning of my hair and scalp every other day is enough to keep it clean and weightless. Most significantly is the volume of my hair that has definitely increased. Of course, at first it is rather hard to notice but soon enough when I run my fingers through my hair, I see that I pulled out less and less falling strain of hair. Maybe the roots of my hair is now much stronger, and maybe the scalp as well. It has been pleasantly surprising that a product could do so much so quickly. I am unfamiliar with the fact that caffeine could help the growth of hair but the micro blend in this formula works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using the shampoo with its conditioner Ultrax Labs Hair Solace Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Conditioner . What better conditioner to go with such a sophisticated product. I wanted the best result and the only way to get it was to use the whole package.</li>
    <li> Am completely dazzled by Ultrax labs hair surge caffeine shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Was super excited when it arrived today and used it right away. It has a incredible fresh scent and has a nice consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Hair was easy to style and it feels fantastic after only one use!&lt;br /&gt;Super satisfied. I already know I will be buying more of this fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> The holy grail of hair loss prevention! I have extremely thick, oily, curly hair and experience TONS of shedding.. I can knit a sweater with the hair I shed. After using the product for a few weeks, I have experienced less shedding, thicker fuller hair. I find using the product consistently and sticking to a hair regimen seriously helps.  A dollop of this goes a LONG way, more bang for your buck. Gone are the days of brushing my hair and not being able to see the bristles due to the amount of hair on it. I absolutely LOVE my long tresses.. Hair feels healthier, looks vibrant and my vacuum cleaner is on a much needed vacation!! Must try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, just very expensive</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo for my mum, as she&#x27;s been complaining about how her hair has been thinning and falling more than usual due to her genetics, and recently age.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since I received the shampoo in the mail, and there&#x27;s been a subtle difference in her hair. It hasn&#x27;t been that long since she started using it, so it isn&#x27;t that noticeable yet, but her hair appears to look more voluminous due to the increase in thickness of the hair strands. She isn&#x27;t noticing as many fallen hairs when showering (she washes her hair every other day, not the 5x a week like recommended) either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course results will grow as usage is continued. Like how if you lose a lot of weight in a short period of time, you&#x27;re more prone to gain the weight back quickly, as opposed to if you slowly transition into a healthier lifestyle, you&#x27;ll be able to maintain your new image, the shampoo works slowly, but does make a difference in long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this shampoo. It is pricey, but you&#x27;ve only got one head of hair. Once your hair starts leaving, it&#x27;ll be difficult to get them to grow back.</li>
    <li> Very small bottle and it does not lather at all. I would not purchase it again</li>
    <li> Since I was young my hair has always been really thick up until now at 29 years old I noticed my hair was starting to thin. Never in my life did I ever think I&#x27;d lose my hair cause my Father always and still does have the longest nicest hair. Extensions have never really worked well with my hair type so the only other option for me was a hair growth shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me months to find the right one and there has got to be thousands on the market so its really hard to choose until I got a recommendation from a friend of mine . She told me I needed to try: Ultrax Labs Hair Surge and that I would order more because I loved it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always listen to my Girlfriends recommendations &#x3D;) So happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In-fact after a week of using this shampoo I started to notice a change in my hair. There we&#x27;re tiny little hairs popping out!&lt;br /&gt;BUT the only thing I don&#x27;t really care for is the SMELL! It doesn&#x27;t leave that nice sweet smell to your hair and that would be great to see them revamp this and make it smell great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the fact that when I put some in my hand to lather up it doesn&#x27;t do so well in that department, so I suggest you thoroughly cover your scalp with it and let it sit there for a few mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seemed really high for a shampoo but if my friend swears by this than I gotta listen to her! So far I really like the value and will buy this again until I see the results I&#x27;m looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at buying this for the first time, than I would recommend it to you just for this reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOP RATED 2014 SHAMPOO FOR HAIR REGROWTH STIMULATION!!!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Hair loss can be embarrassing and expensive to restore. Ultrax Labs Hair Surge has fixed both those problems. You can help re-stimulate your hair growth with their Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo, in your own shower. Without the discomfort of going to a public place or disrupting your normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks and feels just like any other shampoo you use. Just use this in place of your normal shampoo 5 times out of the week, leaving on for 2 minutes at a time, to see results. It&#x27;s as simple as that. I can definitely see a difference around my hairline, and it arrived days earlier than expected from Beauty Superstore, in a non-descript box, so I could get the process started. Compared to what you would have to pay for any other type of treatment for hair loss, you can not beat this price.</li>
    <li> Hair Surge extra strength formula from ultra labs uses ingredients like Ketoconazole, it is a powerful anti-inflammatory as well as a anti-fungal ingredient  that is most  commonly seen in prescription strength dandruff medicines and  shampoo&#x27;s. What wasn&#x27;t realized until recently is just how powerful this ingredient can be for people with thinning hair. It also has ingredients like  cocamidylpropyl betaine  which was named allergen of the year in 2004 by the  American Contact Dermatitis Society. When opening the bottle the liquid smells very nice like a day at the salon.</li>
    <li> This is my first review on Amazon. Like everyone here, I purchase many products on Amazon based on positive user reviews. The reason I am taking the time to write my first review is to help end the debate on whether or not the reviews written for this product are in fact real or fake. Well here is a REAL review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 28 year old male with minimal thinning at the temples (more so on my left). I started noticing thinning about 2 years ago and I wanted to find a simple solution that would help. Searching on Amazon I typed in &#x27;hair growth&#x27; and found this product with great ratings and reviews so I figured why not give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the shampoo first arrived I noticed the bottle is extremely small for the price paid. Now, when using it in the shower I noticed how poorly it lathered up. In order to lather it up the way any other typical shampoo does, it would take you 5 or more pumps of this shampoo which is a lot given its small size. So all those reviews that say it lathers up well, that&#x27;s simply not true. Due to the fact it does not lather up well and because I use strong hair gel, I learned I am not able to only use this shampoo alone otherwise I will shed more than usual. Because of this, I first wash my hair with a thickening shampoo. I rinse then apply 1 pump of Hair Surge. I find that at this point my hair is more slick and does not shed. After I gently rub in Hair Surge into my scalp, I try to let it stay in for 2-5 minutes. At this time I rinse and always notice my hair feels lively and smooth. It does in fact feel like its been stimulated due to the fact it feels thicker and pops out of my scalp. It is hard to describe, but something is definitely working. In regards to its claim of hair growth, in the first week of use I noticed 3 new hairs appear near my left temple which was great since I only used the product for a few days. Besides that there hasn&#x27;t been much hair growth but I do feel it has slowed down my hair loss. I have only purchased 1 shampoo and it has lasted me about 2 months. Although the shampoo has many positives as mentioned, I am unsure if I will be purchasing another bottle due to its price. In conclusion, if you have the money then I recommend purchasing this product and giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has helped!</li>
    <li> This product is effective and not only that but it smells great. Caffeine is a natural remedy for hair loss so it makes sense that it works so well in a shampoo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 days, and I can see a difference already.  I don&#x27;t need to use much to get a good lather.  If I can use it everyday, I would.  My hair does not shed too much anymore and I feel a little volume in myhair.</li>
    <li> The three active ingredients (Ketoconazole, Caffeine, and Palmetto) in this shampoo make it ideal for reducing hair loss and dandruff. This product is ideal for both men and women because it improves hair growth and thickness regardless of testerone levels. Studies have shown that caffeine alone can extend the life of hair follicles. Additional chemicals are left out making this product a safe option. With daily use this product helps achieve the results wanted.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best way to strengthen your hair! I was looking for the best hair growth serum or shampoo and came upon this.  I only shampooed 3 times a week. It is very easy to use and does a great job of strengthening, and thickening your hair. Thick and manageable hair has always been my dream and with this product it has become a reality. I get no shedding when brushing my hair or even while finger combing it in the shower. Each hair strand I can feel is stronger and sleeker. It has a nice tingly sensation when applied and you can feel the results while soon after seeing it as well. I tend to get a lot of dry and frizzy hair especially in the summer. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, lathers well and performs even better. I have suffered for years with breakage primarily due to wearing weaves, and mostly on the sides around my hairline. Have tried everything in the past, but pairing this with natrol biotin, my hair started to grow back in the bald areas within 3 weeks, maybe less. Have been using quite a while now, saw the complaints of the bottle being small, but it&#x27;s not a major complaint for something which does deliver the stated benefits. My hair is strong, no breakage other than a few strands which is normal, I just love this stuff and can definitely, have definitely recommended it!</li>
    <li> The smell is bad, and didn&#x27;t see any changes</li>
    <li> A lot of the reviews will swear by the fact that they experienced hair fullness or regrowth of hair or stimulation of hair where there was no hair otherwise. I am 22 and I started to notice a hair line receding on the two ends of my forehead. This has done little to nothing to prevent that hair line from receding. I haven&#x27;t even noticed a better fullness in my hair overall. Maybe I am crazy, but I feel most of this is just hype. I have been using it for a few months now. Definitely not worth the pretty penny that everyone is spending on this product.</li>
    <li> Simply stated, it does the trick.  My thinning issues have been haunting me for years now, and ever since I started using Ultrax Labs products I can FINALLY notice an actual difference!  It&#x27;s like I have a whole new texture hair, and it&#x27;s definitely starting to take on more thickness.  The consistency was quite different from what I&#x27;m used to.  You can actually feel the essential oils in it.  When you start to lather it on you hair, you can tell by the way it feels that it wants to stay on there for a few minutes.  And you have to let it; a quick lather/quick rinse will not let the shampoo do what it is supposed to do for your hair.  Trust me on this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growth has been my ultimate goal in transforming my locks, and I think that the Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo is going to be my savior!  I&#x27;ve been on the Nioxin line for some months now, but I&#x27;ve been waiting...waiting...and waiting to notice a change--any change--but nothing.  In just one week of using the Hair Surge Caffeine Shampoo daily has had a noticeable affect, and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it&#x27;s going to look a month from now!  And I haven&#x27;t had any major scalp issues since I&#x27;ve switched to this (something that normally accompanies my thinning hair problems).  Scalp has been looking significantly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax Labs products, and this shampoo in particular will now be a staple in my shower!  It&#x27;s a little on the pricey end, but a highly recommended product if you suffer from thinning issues.</li>
    <li> No difference noticed!!</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo twice now, and I have noticed my hair to be a lot shinier as well as feeling thicker. I have not seen a huge change in the hair loss factor as I have only used it twice. But I can say, I didn&#x27;t have a hairbrush full of hair after using it, as I usually would have after other products. I  plan to continuing to use it as I hope the lasting effects will be positive.</li>
    <li> This product works just as it should! The gel application is smooth and and you can almost feel it working after the first time you shampoo with it. Using it for about a week or two and can really see the results. Great for revigorating dry, or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with this product. My hair has started to shed less and more manageable. My hair feels and looks thicker. I love the scent of this product and have been very pleased with the feel of my hair. This product has change my hair from the first shampoo. This shampoo is great because it does not leave a residue on my hair. I am excited to continue using this product as I try to grow my hair out. I am very pleased with the ingredients in this shampoo. It is wonderful to see active ingredients making a change to my hair. This product has had a positive impact on my hair as well as my self esteem. I am just sorry I didn&#x27;t use it sooner.</li>
    <li> As someone suffering from hypothyroidism (which makes my hair fall out), this is a godsend. Not only does it ensure that falling hair is kept at an absolute minimum, I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair is extra shiny, and far less difficult to disentangle after a shower/shampoo. The scent is a bit off-putting, but for someone who&#x27;s had hairfall issues for 20 years, I&#x27;ll put up with anything else. What I do is mix a little bit of my usual shampoo which has a nice fruity scent with it, and I can lather it in as well. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments about my hair as a result.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t want to buy this in the first place because the price, since my hair is so thin and sometimes i feel like i have alot of hair falling of whenever i scratch or feel the need..&lt;br /&gt;so far so good, after taking a few showers&lt;br /&gt;my head feels like ive gained weight and notice a improvement&lt;br /&gt;i would continue using and might getting a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;and i would also might add that the shipping is extremely fast.. ive ordered yesterday&lt;br /&gt;and got it the next day.. seems like it was shipped from my local amazon warehouse distributor..</li>
    <li> What more can i say then i am so thankful for this shampoo. It has reboosted my confidence so much. My hair is long and thin and just keeps getting thinner as i age. I was looking for something that would help but wasnt sure where to start. I tried other products but nothing ever seemed to make a change. I tried this shampoo and noticed a difference pretty quickly. I am on my second bottle and couldnt be happier with the results. My hair is thicker and softer. It has a nice lather to it and it smells nice too. Thank you Ultrax for finally creating a product that really helps!!</li>
    <li> 1st day &amp; so far, so good.  Light, almost non-existant scent.  Hair looks good. Will continue updates in the days ahead.  Day 3 &amp; I have to say, to my surprise, my hair actually looks fuller and thicker !  Will continue updates</li>
    <li> Light weight shampoo which helps stimulate the scalp to prevent hair loss ,revitalizes and  proven to awaken dormant hair follicles and promote for a new healthy re-growth</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little under 2 weeks and have to admit everyone who says it helps reduce shedding is absolutely correct. I shampoo my hair about 3-4 times a week but for this product I decided to use it everyday to see better results in less time. Other than less shedding I have also noticed my hair seems to have &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34;, fluffier curls. Another thing I have noticed is that I tend to have a bit more energy in the morning after showering, which is weird but the product does have caffeine so I&#x27;m guessing my scalp is sensitive to it? Not sure but I like the bit of energy. Now the interesting thing about this product vs the Ultrax Labs Hair Rush pills is it didn&#x27;t provide the me with a more sensitive scalp unlike the pills. Both products helped with shedding and both made my hair fuller but the pills helped me personal de-sensitize my scalp (which is sensitive) but the shampoo gave me that bit of rush in the mornings. Regardless I really like this product, the smell of the shampoo and the results of less shedding, stronger fuller hair and a bit of a kick of energy. I say it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> I went through a whole bottle but didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> been using for about a 2 weeks.very thick formula and does need a conditioner after shampooing but hair is left  thicker.</li>
    <li> I think it is awesome. I actually can definitely see the difference between this and regular shampoo. I would buy this product again when I am done with this bottle. It is certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a sleek design and build. The black color of the bottle makes for a perfect match with any bathroom style or color. The pump is very user friendly which makes product easy to pump out. Holds enough product in its small lengthy size to fit in the shower or bathroom cabinets.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and do all it said it, I was skeptical at first, but after a month of using it every week I noticed a difference in my hair that has begun to grow and let lose, make and this product smell welll.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great! I love the viscosity and the lather of the product. The bottle recommends washing your hair with it 5 days a week which is more than I normally wash my hair, but it is totally worth it. My husband is using it too and we are both getting great results! Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking to slow/reverse hair loss or to get thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Just like any other women we intend to lose hair growth as we age. I have taken vitamins to regain my hair lose. I totally recommended this product if your trying to regain hair and confidence. It beats grom taking pills everyday. I love how i can just use this product in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was throughly impressed with this shampoo. My hair and my scalp feel clean. I followed the directions and have great hair days. Usually there&#x27;s tons of hair in the drain every time I showe, not any more! This rox and I know by the holidays I will have sexy hair again.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge is an intense caffeine based shampoo that is used to stimulate hair growth and reduce hair loss if used consistently about 4 or 5 times a week. I usually wash my hair every other day of the week and I started seeing a difference in a couple of weeks. There is a lot less breakage, which leads to less thinning and after a while new growth is visible. Hair Surge is a lot more effective because it doesn’t just add a couple of hair supporting ingredients that simply treat the hair and then disappears after a couple washes. The mixture of caffeinated compounds, oils and ketoconazole actually reach your hair follicles so it won’t wash out easily. It has a chance to work. You can use the same amount in the same way you use your other shampoos. My favorite part is that it doesn’t smell or feel clinical, it actually smells great and feels refreshing. I absolutely recommend Hair Surge if you’re experiencing hair loss or even thinning. It’s definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> I have long color treated hair(highlights) and up to now was having trouble finding a shampoo that would not strip my hair making it feel dry and brittle while not making it feel like you dumped a bucket of grease on it either as most shampoos for color treated hair tend to make my head feel like. I had used this shampoo twice so far and it leaves my hair with a clean feel and a light citrus scent considering it is a caffeine based product. I also noticed less breakage after washing and do appreciate the fact that I have more hair on my head these days not to mention my drain. I also see the color of my highlights becoming less brassy despite the fact I am due for a touch up which is also an added bonus. I will continue to use Thanks:-)</li>
    <li> i bought this because of all the outstanding reviews. I used this product for 2 weeks. I actually think this product made more of my hair fall out.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT PRODUCT ITS ONE OF THE BEST GROWTH SHAMPOOS. I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT ITS  ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS. THAT I HAVE USED. USING THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND,THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR GROWTH SHAMPOO,ITS NOT LIKE ANY OTHER PRODUCT OUT THERE,I HAVE REORDERED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I LOVE IT YOU WOULD AS WELL.</li>
    <li> Perhaps this product worked for other people, but I saw no improvement in the thickness of my hair. I also thought  it was way overpriced. I will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> As stated it definitely gives you a surge. and estremely strong,I guess that&#x27;s why the bottle isnt huge for its price. normally I&#x27;m a holistic believer . I stopped using  Nisim International shampoo all together cuz it dries my hair and breaks off . But this is a new path for me . I don&#x27;t want to give my hair Xtreme shock all at&lt;br /&gt;once.So gradually been using it in small amounts and its giving me such a smooth light and silky texture  the hardest area to grow back  is  your receding hairline, being pushed , back after years of shape ups. Its working for me.. That what&#x27;s up..&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells , it&#x27;s a clean crisp feeling, most important my hair is thicker.</li>
    <li> Phrase &amp;#34;you pay for what you get&amp;#34; is not applicable here. Buyer beware. Shampoo does not live up to the PR.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this product. Needless to say it works. I wash hair, step one, with a high quality shampoo then repeat using one small squirt of Hair Surge. I scrub it in then let it set while I lather my body and face about three minutes, rinse and towel dry and brush, NOT COMB. I combine hair surge with the Ultra Max Hair nutrient tablets. My hair is thicker, softer and shines. My barber noticed the change in my hair after a month on both products. I am sixty-three years old and thinning hair is hereditary on my mothers side. She only has a few hairs on the top of her head. On my dad&#x27;s side his father was bald and one of his brothers was too. There are no thin spots on my head and where I part my hair has filled in. Both of these products are well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> WARNING THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK AT ALLL WHAT A WASTE!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It&#x27;s started back filling in my receding hair line. I have tried tons of different methods and products but this one really works!</li>
    <li> I researched this product quite a bit before making the decision to test it out myself. I can say that I’m already impressed with the results. I’ll be ordering more as soon as I run out. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> great product. I took out a star for two reasons. The pump doesn&#x27;t work that well. It simply stays down after pumping it once. Second, you need to use a dab of random shampoo first to clean your hair. After you clean your hair, use this product as advertised and it will lather really well. I am talking 3x better than when your hair is dirty. Onto the hair regeneration part. I feel that this is working a bit. I certainly feel the tingle here and there. I did notice a small section of regrowth. I&#x27;m doing 10000mcg biotin, vitamin-e 400 units, multivitamin.</li>
    <li> For a hair loss shampoo its not as expensive as other one&#x27;s just like it. And anything that keeps my hair on my head is a good product to me! My hair is getting thicker and not so thin as it was, my hair is so soft and is actually growing back very quickly. I like the unusual scent it has. I have struggled with thin hair all my life so this is really helping me.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great and seems to be slowing the shedding I&#x27;m experiencing months after having a baby (when hormones realize you&#x27;re not preggo anymore and you&#x27;re no longer taking prenatal vitamins, you shed!). Using a few times a week mixed w my regular moisturizing shampoo. Hope the benefit continues and maybe my husband will try it... Not that he &amp;#34;needs&amp;#34; it yet!</li>
    <li> this items work great in some cases that you need regrouth heair and smell so well and is realy works.</li>
    <li> I have straight (for the most part) shoulder length hair and live in Florida where it is very hot and muggy. Normally, I have to put quite a bit of product in my hair to keep it from getting frizzy throughout the day. After only a few uses of this product, I noticed that my hair texture and condition was improved. I am using less product and it feels stronger. I also noticed that others haven’t been pointing out or picking off embarrassing stray hair off the back of my dark colored shirts like they had previously. The pump dispenser is convenient in the shower and the shampoo lathers up nicely. I’ve had great results and am happy to support made in the USA products.</li>
    <li> I actually received this product as a gift from a family member. I was one of those people who had nice thick hair that everyone wanted. Then I became one of those people who ruined their hair from using a hair straightener too often and not using the right protective hair products to protect their hair from the heat. Needless to say I was devastated when I finally realized just how bad my hair was looking. I hadn&#x27;t thought to use a product like this until it was given to me. By the time I finished the first handful of bottles, I was hooked. I can definitely feel and see a difference and so can those around me. I am finally gaining the confidence back that I used to have and it feels so good! I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has lost confidence in their hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, I have noticed my hair looking fuller just after a few times using it. I am very happy and would recommend to anyone that needs a little help.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves hair with a deep cleansed feeling after washing without feeling &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34;. The scent isn&#x27;t overbearing, and it contains ketoconazole which is a well-known ingredient for hair loss. I also like the fact that it has natural ingredients, and essential oils. Highly recommend if you are experiencing some thinning. A good way to take preventative measures before it gets out of control.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo is absolutely amazing. I have seen results within the first few days, the shampoo lathers up really well and it has a nice tingle on my scalp along with a great smell. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and with the shampoo coming super fast I would definitely order from Ultrax Labs again!</li>
    <li> The product lives up to expectation.It is exactly like the picture front a back.The contents inside the bottle is very clear gel type form and it smells amazing.For those of you that cannot determine if this is for men or woman,it is UNISEX(for both).Make sure that when you use it it lathers well in the head for about 2 minutes,THEN carry on with how you wash your hair.I did not experience itch or discomfort so that is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for approx. a week. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results this soon, but I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the amount of hair that comes out during showers. I&#x27;ve also noticed a few baby hairs starting to grow in my hairline on forehead. I am very happy with this purchase to date and will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> i see some result,i know its not bring to my youth at least looks better now</li>
    <li> Rating would be 0 or Neg 1 as it has severe impact on hair loss. I tried this shampoo along with the conditioner as recommended by any other user  for 5 months almost every day (recommended usage: 5/7). But except for the hair loss which increased double the amount no improvement nor any better with hair growth. This shampoo is complete waste of money and effort. Please do not try this shampoo .</li>
    <li> No more dandruff or itchy scalp. Have not noticed any new hair growth.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this when I bought it, but I LOVE THIS! When I first pumped it out it felt thick. After I got out of the shower my head felt kind of tingly and while I was blow drying I realized I wouldn&#x27;t have to use any of my thickening or boosting product that day. Definitely a time saver!</li>
    <li> I was loyal to my former shampoo for many years. The choice to make the switch was not a rash one. However my thinning hairline gave me a wandering eye. All options (except plugs) were suddenly on the table. After seeing it recommended on a few sites, I picked up a bottle to see for myself.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been pleasantly surprised. First and foremost it’s a good shampoo. It cleans my hair, which is it’s main job. Everything else is gravy. It produces a good, full lather. It’s got a pleasant smell. And where other, inferior shampoos leave your hair feeling good but not great, this one leaves you better than when it found you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it restoring my hair? Difficult to say. However I will say that I feel something is happening. Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Absolute nightmare, never review products but this, in combination with the hair lush serum, and ultrax labs shampoo has caused increased shedding-even after stopping the products!  This stuff is toxic for the scalp, I agree with many others that many of the other reviews must be pumped up and fake.  Used Rogaine for 11 months and experienced some nice thickening, some regrowth, and mainly stabilization of hair loss.  Now I have a great deal of damaged brittle hairs, massively increased hair shedding, and all the hair and then some has been lost in a matter of weeks.  Can&#x27;t stress enough to avoid this product, Amazon is currently doing an investigation regarding the quality and safety of this product as a result of my complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of great things about this product. I purchased it and it just arrived today! I just finished shampooing my hair just a few minutes ago. It shipped so quickly. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to arrive so fast. There&#x27;s always tomorrow but tomorrow needs to hurry up! :)  I can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair n it fall out every where but thank god i found his shampoo. This is the best shampoo I ever used.it made my super thin hair grow fast n fill in patches where I had lost hair from it didn&#x27;t take long to grow. I tried multiple  shampoo product&#x27;s that say they will help hair grow n I have spent 100 n $100s of dollars ,noting worked this one for sure did. Also it made my hair feel full n even look fuller,&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this product to anyone who has spent years destroying their hair through incessant bleaching, dying, heat, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Report this review</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and it has been working well for me.  I noticed results within the first week and I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell weird.  Also, my hair looks great, so it not only appears to have stopped my hair loss but also is a good shampoo in general.  Definitely worth the money.  I am very happy with this shampoo and will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Love! I really works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working for me, good product!</li>
    <li> Yes, it is expensive. Yes, it is worth it. When a friend recommended this caffeinated shampoo, I was pretty skeptical. At around $45 the product is not cheap. But I took a leap of faith and purchased. My hair is very important to me, and I suffer major loss - especially in the winter. After a week or two of using this shampoo, I noticed I was cleaning  less hair from my drain and brushing my hair was no longer a traumatic experience. I don&#x27;t really understand the elements at play, but I try to avoid looking gift horses in the mouth. :P Bonus? Took care of my winter dandruff. I&#x27;m not mad.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not cheap and did not see any visible results</li>
    <li> This product is a must buy. It really works. Within two weeks I already seen a big difference in my hair growth. My hair is shiny and looks so healthy. I highly recommend this product to men and women. And it smells great. If you want rapid real results this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I Bought this shampoo mostly due to small gaps i have in my hair including my beard. All i needed was a minor stimulation and thats exactly what i got but even more! I used the shampoo when it first arrived yet saw no improvement so i decided to use it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;After less than two weeks using this product on both my beard and scalp today i woke up and my gaps had heavy stubble! I just knew i had to write a review, if you have major hair loss i would imagine you would need to be very strict with your use to see results. The rest of my hair that is already grown has become thicker with each use and i just cant wait for the rest to catch up.&lt;br /&gt;For me, im hopeful that perfecting my regiment will increase the stubble and allow the folicles to grow out as long as the rest of my hair in time.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor...Get Some Stubble Going!!!</li>
    <li> This is seriously the most amazing shampoo ever!!! I lost a lot of hair following surgeries and health issues. When I ordered this product for the first time it has 25 five stars I think it has a thousand positive reviews. My hair is growing back and I am positive the shampoo is the reason. I have tried SO so so many others but this one is amazing!!!!! It is a little drying so I use a macadamia nut hair mask with it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I noticed that my hair was thicker, fuller and more manageable after only one use. I have been using this shampoo for over a week now and it has made a world of a difference for me. I am now able to style my hair and clean my scalp thoroughly without shedding any further. I am very excited about the results from using this product and I will definitely reorder! I strongly recommend using this product if you are suffering from thinning hair or hair loss.</li>
    <li> For the past several years I&#x27;ve noticed shedding when the seasons change. My hair is naturally curly and wavy although I do chemically straighten it. Compared to other shampoos, I could feel a difference after using the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge, even before I began to condition it. My hair felt more resilient and the follicles were smooth, which was a very pleasant surprise as I normally see some frizziness after washing my hair. It does lather nicely but also feels moisturizing, not just soapy. The scent is neutral similar to a hand soap scent so it is not overly perfumed (which can normally lead to dryness). Styling is now easier, whether I am blowdrying my hair or letting it dry naturally. Looking forward to seeing the results over the next few months.</li>
    <li> Wow !  This is not your usual grocery store shampoo!  The consitency is thicker then anything that I have ever used. It is clear and almost a little sticky on your hands.  I definitely got a scalp massage...  The scent is amazing.  Using this shampoo is like a spa aromatherapy treatment in your shower!  I&#x27;d use it just for the scent! The mix of essential oils is amazing.  My hair felt squeaky clean at the scalp but not at all dried out on the ends!  ( I have longish hair.)  Usually, anything that felt really clean was also really drying.  I thought shampoo&#x27;s were basically all the same but not this one.  It is different.</li>
    <li> Bought this Shampoo a few times, I love it, my hair is shinny and getting thicker with each use. I think the smell is wonderful a few shampoos I&#x27;ve tried for this problem smelt like crushed asprin. It makes my hair bouncy, and easily styled. I have long bangs and they curl like heck, but this shampoo has helped me stop that and alos worked on not loosing a lot of hair! Love this product!! I dye my hair and some products pull the red right out, but from what I can tell my hair hasn&#x27;t faded much either in using this product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo definitely works! The bottle is a little on the small side but it really cleans your hair so everyday shampooing isn&#x27;t necessary. Shedding is significantly improved and my hair feels thicker and fuller. It works after a week so it is well worth the price! The shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell like coffee, thankfully, it has a clean, citrusy smell that reminds me of health spa. Very relaxing scent and effective at stopping hair loss... What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Amazing! Not only did this make my hair fuller and thicker it stopped shedding and increased smoothness. The texture of the shampoo itself is nice as well. . It lathers very good!</li>
    <li> This is an extremely drying shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is hands down the best that I have ever tried it leaves my hair soft hydrated and I love the tingling on my scalp would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Since I am in my 50&#x27;s I have noticed so much hair loss!  I used to pull my hair back but it recedes to much now.&lt;br /&gt;After I shampoo my comb is full of hair.  So needless to say I have been looking and trying products that claim&lt;br /&gt;to help with the hair loss.  When I came across this shampoo I was skeptical.  It seemed a little pricey but since&lt;br /&gt;there was a 100% satisfaction guarantee I figured I did not have anything to loose, just buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two weeks, I have been using it everyday for the 5 days as recommended and I can honestly say I&lt;br /&gt;see a real difference in my hair.  My husband said he could see a difference.  After I wash my hair there is definitely&lt;br /&gt;less hair in my comb and I can see some hair growth in the areas where the hair was receding!  Not bad for just&lt;br /&gt;a few short weeks.  The shampoo itself has a pleasant smell and pretty good lather and my hair is clean and looks&lt;br /&gt;really healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the products I have purchased to help me &amp;#34;recover&amp;#34; some of my lost hair I would say this one is one of my&lt;br /&gt;favorites.  I am going to keep using it and am excited to see the results in the next month.  Honestly, this is one of the&lt;br /&gt;best products I have used.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to believe about the benefits of this shampoo ,but after researching and googleing its ingredients I found the 0.2% Ketoconazole, it is  an anti fungal of wide spectrum which can prevent fungus from growing in your scalp and keeping you from getting any seborreic disease of the scalp ,in the long term  I&#x27;ve experienced at least the stopping of my hair and my wife&#x27;s too on the shower strainer ,no more clogging so far,besides the clean fragrance and moisturizing properties it gets on your hair without that sensation of dryness and breaking,I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I got the shampoo in the mail, I was curious to see the results it brought to my hair. Lately my hair has been very brittle, and shedding constantly. I started using Ultrax Labs Surge Caffeine Shampoo and even after the third day, my hair became very soft and got it&#x27;s shine back. The actual shampoo is clear and has a fresh, almost mint like, smell that&#x27;s pleasant and leaves my hair smelling clean. If I saw results in just three days imagine what my hair is going to be like in a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m excited to keep on seeing the results, and definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 41 year old man with minor hair loss.  This is my first time trying this product.  I use it more or less as directed.  It doesn’t burn or create any discomfort and the aroma is pleasant.  It doesn’t seem to conflict with any other products I use either.  Good product.  Reversing hair loss is not an exact science, so I don&#x27;t expect an overnight miracle, nor did I get one.  But noticing less shedding and although it is early in the game, I am sure I notice the beginnings of regrowth and strengthening of my existing hair.</li>
    <li> This product has dramatically improved the health and thickness of my hair! I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few weeks now and couldn&#x27;t be happier. My hair has never looked or (more importantly) FELT this great! Generates a lot of lather and smells nice without being overpowering. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have noticed no difference and have been using this product for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scariest thing about it was my hair was falling out when I started using this. I&#x27;d look at my hands after lathering my hair up (and this shampoo seems to take a lot to make it lather up good) and massaging the shampoo into the scalp. I&#x27;d look at my hands while soapy foam was on them right after shampooing and would see many of my hairs in the foam, enough that it startled me. I read that this happens because the weak hair falls out and are replaced by new stronger hair. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any new hair grow, but my hair doesn&#x27;t really fall out anymore when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the results vary from person to person. I&#x27;m 26 and noticed my hair on top my head was thinning and wanted to see if I could thicken it back up and regrow some of the lost hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe results take a while, but over a month down the road I see no visible difference. Price is quite high too.</li>
    <li> Ultrax is the first shampoo product that I&#x27;ve found actually reduces hair loss. Since using the shampoo, I have seen less hair falling off when brushing. The hair is clean, shiny and easy to manage. Hair also feels thicker and stronger. I also love how it leaves your scalp &#x27;tingling&#x27; after which is a great sensation</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for over 6 months and I can see a change in the fullness and texture of my hair. I have straight hair and the older I get it seems the more I deal with my hair thinning, I have  seen a huge difference in my hair strength and seen a enormous amount of new hair growing in spot that were thinning out. I highly recommend this shampoo. I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo without the belief of it working. In the past I have tried many other similar products without good results. I just recently started using this shampoo and I can already see some of my hair growing back thicker and fuller. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> It works. There&#x27;s not much more to it than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first few uses, you&#x27;ll feel noticeably thicker hair, which is a bit strange at first (I suppose that&#x27;s the first indication that the ingredients are being delivered properly to your hair and scalp). This shampoo does not foam like the cheaper non-hair-restoring products everyone is used to, but it definitely cleans while doing what it&#x27;s supposed to; you&#x27;ll get the same clean hair feeling as you would with any other shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some time to see the results of the shampoo (about 1 week to be able to see the difference and feel less shedding), but there is definitely an improvement in hair thickness. About 2-3 weeks after that, if not earlier, you&#x27;ll likely be able to see an improvement in hair growth. This product might not promise instant results like the scams out there, but it does guarantee actual results for those who really want hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> If you want  a shampoo that will tangle your hair into a matted mess please buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Let me be honest... I was skeptical of this product because I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on similar products with no results. This shampoo is amazing. I love the slight tingle in the scalp followed by the cooling sensation of the peppermint oil pure bliss in a bottle. I see a difference already and will order again soon.</li>
    <li> Immediately once I started using this product my hair stopped falling out in the shower. After a year of use my hair has started to grow a bit thicker and help with the bald spot I had stating on the top.</li>
    <li> I had no idea caffeine could be added to a shampoo, but Ultrax Labs Hair Surge proves caffeinated compounds can stimulate hair growth! I’m able to apply this shampoo the same way I would with any other shampoo, but the results with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge are remarkably different! After using it for only a short period of time, I noticed fuller, thicker hair. Now, I use it every day, and this shampoo has given me the best hair of my lifetime. Use Ultrax Labs Hair Surge to get the full, thick hair you’ve always wanted!</li>
    <li> Save your money, doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> I got this product because my hair has been thinning the past few years.  I&#x27;ve used this for a while and have seen great results.  The shampoo works well and I&#x27;m seeing less shedding and fuller hair.  This is the best product that I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s very simple to use.  I like using this shampoo and love the fact that it smells good.  I would definitely recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Have not lost any hair since i been using it. Coincidence I think not!</li>
    <li> Not sure where all the great reviews came from.  I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and used all of both bottles.  It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but I saw no improvement and it didn&#x27;t lather well.  I&#x27;ve had better luck with other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Let me say first that I am not looking for a miracle. There is really not much that can be done from an 8oz bottle of shampoo that can alter genetics, reverse years of burning on a blower and flat iron, or remove damage from chemically frying my hair for an entire lifetime. That being said I do need a LOT of help. The amount of breakage i experience on a daily basis is actually quite frightening. No woman wants to lose her hair. I ordered this product after reading he wonderful reviews. I make my own soaps and I use coffee in all of them so I know that it works. I was excited to find it in a shampoo. Again, this isn&#x27;t a miracle. I didn&#x27;t wake up and find long strong perfectly undamaged locks comparable to rapunzel. What I did find, however, is a LOT less breakage. My hair does feel a bit thicker. Perhaps it is &amp;#34;stimulated growth&amp;#34; perhaps it&#x27;s the fact that it&#x27;s a bit more protected, I do not know. Honestly I do not care!! I noticed a difference and that is HUGE for me! It is very thick and he lather isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;bubbly&amp;#34; as I am used to but that makes no matter. It smells Great too. Overall I find the product incredible!</li>
    <li> Great product smells great and actually works on me! Last a bit long so Ill say just buy one for now till it runs out.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I should rate this yet, since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week so far.  I&#x27;ll probably come back again to update the review.  But, I have noticed some things already.  It really doesn&#x27;t lather well, so it&#x27;s a little difficult to get all over the head, but I do think it cleaned the hair well.  Didn&#x27;t really feel a tingling sensation or anything as others had mentioned.  Doesn&#x27;t really have a distinct smell or anything, which I&#x27;m not complaining.. I&#x27;d rather it have a slight smell than a strong nasty smell.  I use this with the new Pureology Conditioner for fine color treated hair, and my hair actually feels really great.  Again, only used a handful of times so far, so not sure if it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; yet or not.  This is a small bottle for the price.. FYI.  I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to that when I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I also just started taking biotin pills, so I won&#x27;t be certain which is working the wonders or growth stimulation, but I&#x27;ll still come back for a review later on if anything changes.</li>
    <li> did not work like it said. it didnt do anything at all for my hair. it actually made me lose more hair than normal.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it shipped! I ordered the product and it shipped that day and I received it faster then expected. As far as the profit I used as directed and as promised I am noticing small hair growth after a week. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly. Was concerned about the smell as sometimes medicinal shampoos can have a bad odor, however, this smells good. You do need to use a few pumps to get a good lather but it leaves my hair feeling very clean - and smoothness was an unexpected bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s early yet, but I believe I&#x27;m seeing an improvement in my hair growth and quality already.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It smells so good with a citrus scent, it leaves the hair feeling extremely clean and light and fresh. The oil build is eliminated with this product. Within the first week you can feel a difference. It leaves the hair feeling and looking thicker and you can notice it growing fast. This was well worth the money!</li>
    <li> After just a week my friends and family(who see me on a regular basis)  were starting to tell me my hair looked thicker.  I could really feel the extra volume from my roots to scalp. This shampoo smells great and makes your hair feel really clean.  My wife tried it and said it felt like the high quality shampoos from the upscale salons she sometimes treats herself to.  Great value, it feels like my hair got a reboot ! I highly recommend trying this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Something I have always struggled with is thin hair - I have tried so many products that pledge to thicken my hair and increase volume. Some have worked, others definitely have not. I love this product because it actually makes my hair feel fuller. When I get out of the shower my hair feels heavier and when it dries it feels smoother and the texture is much more easier to manage. I love this product and definitely intend to use it again.</li>
    <li> I really was skeptical about this product, but thought I would give it a try.  The shampoo smells really good (definitely not medicinal in any way) and is not gender specific; it&#x27;s good for men or women.  We have hard water, so it doesn&#x27;t lather very much, but nothing does.  The lather isn&#x27;t the important part, anyway.  It rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my hairdresser and it has worked amazingly well! Since i&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has been falling out alot less and feels alot thicker. Now I know why its called &amp;#34;Surge&amp;#34; because it worked FAST. I am feeling alot more confident about myself without the thinning at my temples and to me that is priceless. I highly recommend this shampoo IT WORKS! It also leaves my hair looking great and my scalp feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. After the first wash I could visibly see the results . I noticed right away that my hair was thicker . I would definitely recommend this product if your looking to make your hair thicker</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo as directed for several weeks now. I&#x27;m surprised to say I can actually tell a difference. I have very fine, thin, long hair and I feel like it&#x27;s been getting thinner lately. I bought this to try to ensure I keep what hair I have and to see if it would thicken and also to help it grow longer, faster. I&#x27;ve had multiple co-workers comment on how long my hair has gotten and I definitely feel like it&#x27;s thicker---or at least I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m losing as much hair in the shower and feel like it&#x27;s made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons to me:&lt;br /&gt;-I find it to be a bit thick--almost like honey and I feel like I use a lot and have to work it hard to get a decent lather that covers my whole head&lt;br /&gt;-I think (not certain though) it makes my hair a bit greasier--already a greaseball but I feel like my dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t work as well if I try to skip a day of washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using it...will see how long the bottle lasts and if I notice any permanent, measurable improvement, but so far I&#x27;m not dissatisfied</li>
    <li> This shampoo have did nothing but work miracles for me, finding hair loss solutions and products can be a hassle. My searching have been gone and forgotten ever since I start using this product. Effectiveness Is the number one trait that this shampoo have. Let your hair loss no longer be. Tired of wasting time trying to find the right product? Tired of wasting money? Here is the solution to every question you may have. You waby to start making progress finally. Get this product it will change everything.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a big bottle! I was pleasantly surprised it was a nice size bottle and not a tiny waste of money.  My mom took it from me  and she&#x27;s been using it for herself. There&#x27;s plenty to go around and she&#x27;s very happy with it too.  It&#x27;s not a thick heavy shampoo. It&#x27;s nice and light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. I hope to use it for at least a few months and get great results.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product , I was going to wait until i had my hakr groomed but i was innvolved with a splash so k had to wash it right then.When I tell you guys that the moment I put this shampoo on my head I felt so nice and cool with a relaxing breezy sensation , I knew something went right ! And it actually made my head have a whole new texture feel definitely would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is so much fuller and healthier after using this product. I only use a little bit and keep it on for 5 mins in the shower. I also only wash my hair every couple of days and it stays so nice on the off days. Great product and definitely worth the buy.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s good but still waiting for the results</li>
    <li> I&amp;apos;ve been using this along with the Hair Solace for at least a month now. I&amp;apos;m not really sure if it&amp;apos;s working or not. I felt I needed to explain further. I had weight loss surgery last year and in the process of losing a lot of weight my hair started falling out in abundance (typical for WLS patients). I was told to try this product along with the \\&quot;Hair Solace\\&quot; conditioner. I&amp;apos;m 10 months out from surgery now and the hair loss has gone back to normal, everyday stuff. I&amp;apos;ve been using these two products for well over a month but I only wash my hair every other day. The product smells fine and I only use a very little bit. The shampoo lathers up wonderfully and the conditioner is silky smooth. Whether it&amp;apos;s the product bringing my hair back to normal or not, I don&amp;apos;t know, but I do like the product.</li>
    <li> Horrible shampoo.. I need  my money back..my hair is greasy and I haven&#x27;t seen any results.. Wasted money.  Don&#x27;t  buy..</li>
    <li> Pretty certain most of the positive reviews for this product are fake. Not sure what is in this shampoo but it certainly doesn&#x27;t help hair growth. Steer clear, save your money.</li>
    <li> Wow. I was surprised from the first use that my hair already looked thicker. My hair is thin, and I always tease it to make it look fuller. I was shocked after letting it air dry as my usual routine  that I didn&#x27;t need to do anything to make it look fuller.</li>
    <li> This my first using this product. Young 24 yr old female. Been having problems around my headline... Since i use it i haven&#x27;t had any issues,  this is a good product so far.</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit apprehensive about buying this product due to the cost and was a bit weary&lt;br /&gt;if this product would work for people of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the very first wash I could tell this product was of good quality. I absolutely love it&#x27;s clean-scent fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;For the cost, it does what it claim it will do. My hair feels clean and healthy; although, it&#x27;s too soon to tell&lt;br /&gt;any long-term affect, I am optimistic in it&#x27;s continual usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is minimal for the benefits you get with this product. I love that it&#x27;s gentle to where it&#x27;s needed on my&lt;br /&gt;hair shafts but, powerful enough to help my specific hair needs. My hair really feels clean, I like that.</li>
    <li> This Ultrax Lab Hair Surge Shampoo is extremely effective and the results are mind blowing. I have had a bald spot towards the lower left side of my head for as long as I can remember and Ultrax Lab Shampoo changed that within 2-3 weeks. I started to notice a very light hair growth, believe me when I say that this product really works! The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as your typical shampoo so that is surprising but it leaves hair soft and clean without that disgusting streaky feeling (which i hate). After shampooing, I religiously check for any shedding just because I&#x27;m like OCD about it and there is always little to none. This shampoo is truthfully just perfect in my eyes. Not to mention the scent is a cross between citrus and fresh and I personally love it. I recommend anyone with chronic hair loss at least give it a try.</li>
    <li> Within just a few days, my hair already feels thicker. Plus, when I pull it into a ponytail it seems fuller than it has previously. The shampoo has a crisp scent and a slight invigorating tingle, which is a nice addition to my morning routine. This is a nice, thick, rich shampoo and it lathers well and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft. It also has a clarifying effect that gets rid of buildup from other hair products such as creams, gels and hairspray. It isn’t drying like many shampoos, and, rather than hanging limp or frizzing, my hair is smooth and has plenty of body and movement.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Just after using it one time I could feel a difference in my hair. I&#x27;ve always been worried about hair loss but was told that much was normal and after using this it&#x27;s been ALOT less. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with Hair Surge. I feel that it not only states that it is deeply penetrating my scalp but that it in fact does and steadily works when other products don&#x27;t. My hair is thin and I already within the short timeframe of using Hair Surge have noticed my hair getting stronger and more hairs appearing around my edges. I stand by this product as being a genuine article that will give you real results you can see.</li>
    <li> If there is one thing that I have noticed after using Hair Surge, is that it definitely does thicken your hair. After lathering it up, my head begins to feel a scintillating sensation. It&#x27;s a light burn that lets you know that the hair follicles are reacting to the product. I haven&#x27;t grown much hair since using the product but the thinning has stopped and my hair does not fall out as easily. I recommend the product simply because it helps out in other areas and makes my hair feel stronger and thicker. I will wait more time to see if I can grow more hair.</li>
    <li> great product. easy pump top. smooth consistency  Leaves the Hair feeling good</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth every penny! I&#x27;ve been a fan of this shampoo for a while now. Since using the Ultrax Hair Surge shampoo , my hair has thickened heavily, has more luster, and body. The caffeine in this shampoo gives my scalp a surge of energy with every use. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments since adding this shampoo to my daily routine. So much better than the competition! ,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very thick shampoo, you don&#x27;t need to use much, so a single bottle goes a very long way. Hopefully, the restorative benefits will continue through the whole bottle and any that may be needed after.</li>
    <li> I used to be a stylist so this is a semi professional review. I changed my review to &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like&amp;#34; half way through based on the changes it made in my overall hair texture, not growth or loss. At first I loved the way my hair felt, I probably had a ton of build up based on hard water and product and this took it down to my own hair which is very fine and certainly thinner than it used to be or I would not be searching in the first place. So half a bottle left after about 6 weeks of use. I know about growth cycles and I possibly didn&#x27;t use it through a cycle, I just got fearful of the end result if continued  I did not see a Surge, probably a waste of money and possibly a negative effect long term. Again I looked for a miracle and I know this is not it. And at worst this is not good advertising, you will not experience a surge and you will spend a ton of money hoping you found a cure.</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo daily, for 3 weeks now.. NO results EXCEPT all my hair is falling out! Wow!.. I have never used any type of shampoo in my entire life that makes me loose this much hair!!! This can&#x27;t be good for your scalp or hair follicle. The shampoo does not lather at all!! The shampoo dries my hair. I will not purchase the conditioner either.. not at 43 bucks ... NOOO way!.  Another suggestion is to read the 1 and 2 star reviews and skip all the fake 5 star reviews... This is how they bs there way into your pocket book! This shampoo is garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently turned 30 years young and have been losing hair and looking for a solution. This product by far exceeded my expectations, i noticed hair growth within days of using product. AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say it can grow hair, but after just a few days my scalp and hair are in better shape than they&#x27;ve been in a long time. This is better than both shampoo and conditioner. The anti-fungal ingredient caught my eye in the description, so if you happen to be buying a dandruff shampoo and conditioner you&#x27;re probably spending as much and this has great results.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning &amp; falling out due to pregnancy but after using this shampoo only 2 times I see improvement! This product is amazing. It definitely exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants fuller hair, with loss reduction and growth stimulation! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Does not result stimulate hair growth or stop hair loss. Had to use so much shampoo just to get my hair clean. Used for two months and purchased two bottles of shampoo and conditioner to give company benefit of the doubt.  I tried to contact seller about a refund and was told no!</li>
    <li> I have very thin, limp weak hair and it sheds a lot especially when I comb the hair or shower. Upon using this shampoo, I noticed my hair was thicker, and had more substance and volume to it. I like that this product makes my hair feel fuller and stronger and I&#x27;m also not shedding as frequent. There is a slight tingling sensation when you use the shampoo, which indicates to me that it is stimulating the scalp. My hair feels clean after using the shampoo, there is no leftover residue and is very soft to the touch. I love how full my hair looks now, I really see an improvement.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works as advertised!  Once I used it for a couple days, my scalp felt energized and stimulated.  After one more day, I could actually feel the shampoo working. It has an added benefit not heavily advertised, too - dandruff fighter.  Ultrax apparently includes some anti-dandruff ingredients in it&#x27;s formula, and I noticed a difference there, as well.  It is, overall, an EXCELLENT product, one I would recommend to anyone looking to regrow hair - well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Worthless. Expensive price with zero results. Check reviews from non Amazon sites. Amazon is known for putting up bogus reviews to increase sales. Seriously, see a dermatologist for help. Don&#x27;t buy into this snake oil like I did.  Does absolutely nothing except cost 10 times more than regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of caffeine stimulating hair growth so after researching I had high hopes for this product. I absolutely love it. My hair feels healthier than it has in years, it&#x27;s very shiny and the shedding is greatly reduced! I noticed an improvement right away. I love how clean and soft it makes my hair feel and theres no icky residue.This awesome combination of ingredients has proven very effective and I&#x27;m really excited to see how my hair continues to improve. If you suffer from thinning, unhealthy hair and have tried other products with minimal, if any results then you should definitely try this product. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this shampoo.  I&#x27;d looked for a shampoo that would help the overall health of my hair... By chance, Hair Surge was recommended...  At first, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it. But after purchasing and using several times, I see the difference it has made on my hair. Actually, after the very first shampoo my hair looked healthier, felt softer and now as I have continued application, it is thicker...</li>
    <li> Great product! Beats those over the counter products for hair growth.Wow! It really works and I see hair growth all over my head&lt;br /&gt;.It looks fuller and  beautiful. Nice lathering and smells great too!Thanks for creating such a wonderful product that works!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair has never been this silky or full. I love this product. I recommend it to everyone and I even suggested it to my hairstylist.</li>
    <li> This product is definitely a MUST HAVE! I have been using it weekly for over a month now and I am definitely satisfied with the progress I&#x27;m seeing. I had a head full of long, thick hair so when it began shedding terribly, I was almost in a state of shock. I use a generous amount of this hair treatment on a weekly basis and have been seeing nothing but GREAT results after each use. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all. I also like the fact that it comes in a bottle with a pump which makes it much easier to use especially when washing my hair in the sink. If I could give his product ten stars, I would do so without any hesitation!</li>
    <li> Finally a product that actually delivers on its promises! I have seen significant new hair growth in the past few months, and am committed to this product. The smell and lather are an extra touch, but the main component of my hair growth is life changing and a major self-esteem booster. I have tried countless products before and all have failed. There is such a difference between a shampoo that is loaded with cheap chemicals but wrapped in nice packaging and a product that actually makes a difference in the look and feel of my hair and hairline. I&#x27;m so glad I took a leap of faith and invested in this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Started using it for 3 weeks.  It smells good, but I still don&#x27;t notice any hair growth yet. But as far as shampoos go, my hair does feel clean. I will give it more time to see what happens</li>
    <li> Cleans well and has quality ingredients. I haven&#x27;t seen any new hair growth after two bottles, but it does seem like the shampoo makes the hair that I do have stronger and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this shampoo is that to use it by itself - and thus, get the full effects of the product - it takes a LOT of product. It doesn&#x27;t lather well at all. This is made worse by how small the bottle is: it&#x27;s nowhere near the size of a standard shampoo. On top of this, considering that they want you to use this five days a week, you&#x27;ll go through it very quickly. Hell, I shampoo every two to three days and I went through the bottle in about a month and a half while diluting the shampoo half-and-half with water to make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Given all this, and the fact that this price is RIDICULOUS,I won&#x27;t be repurchasing. Worth a shot, I guess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old and have been shedding a lot the past 2 years from what I&#x27;m guessing is due to stress. This product had minimized the shedding in the little time I&#x27;ve been using it. The wonderful smell is an added bonus!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great ! I used it everyday for a week. My hair use to shed a lot. It would be all over the sink when I combed or brushed it. After using this product for 2 days the shedding &amp;#34;stopped&amp;#34;. I had a &amp;#34;ball-spot&amp;#34; in the top of my head. After day 4, I noticed the &amp;#34;ball-spot&amp;#34; was filling in. This product is great ! If you are trying to grow your hair...this is the shampoo you need !!!!</li>
    <li> Finally! A shampoo that actually does what it claims. After several years of trying products for my thinning hair, I noticed a difference the first time I used this shampoo. My hair felt thicker and actually held the style all day, as opposed to falling flat and having to re-spray several times throughout the day. My hair was shiney and soft, and I felt a spark of hope that my future was not to be follically challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a pleasant scent to it, although it doesn&#x27;t lather as generously as some regular shampoos. Perhaps that&#x27;s part of the reason it works. I have never paid this much money for a shampoo, and the bottle seems small compared to the price, but it&#x27;s definitely a product worth factoring into a monthly spending budget.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has worked really well and I’ve noticed an obvious improvement in my hair. After using for just about a week my hair is fuller and stronger and sheds a lot less than it ever has before. It also has a nice smell and leaves my scalp feeling fresh and clean. I highly recommend this shampoo and will definitely continue to order.</li>
    <li> Starting with the plastic bottle itself, I liked it. It was small and professional looking. The name &amp;#34;Hair Surge&amp;#34; really hits the nail on the head. I used it (per directions) for five days a week and noticed my hair not only looking longer but feeling thicker. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> With two pumps, Hair Surge lathers up. That small amount is enough for short hair, might need two more pumps for longer hair. It comes out in a clear liquid and smells nice, clean. The scent is mild. It’s easy to work the product through your hair. I felt a slight tingle in my scalp. It fades as you let the product sit in your hair a minute. After washing out, it left hair clean – just like normal shampoo. I did not feel the need to use conditioner. It’s easy to make it part of a daily routine. After a week, scalp feels good. Hair loss about the same at first, but I was afraid that daily washing might make more hair fall out. It did not, and has lessened. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Crappy stuff. Save your money. I doubt for this product&#x27;s any rating over 2 for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No improvement. Better off with much cheaper yet good quality products</li>
    <li> If you want to regrow your hair this is not going to do. I think any 5 star reviewers were paid to buy the product by a secondary agency via a Craigslist ad.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, expensive but it&#x27;s better to spend on one product rather then spending on 10 , that does not work. I saw result in first 5 day, looking forward for more:). And also does not smell like chemical or alcohol,which is a plus point for me. A must have for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time today so I can&#x27;t comment on long term effects but my first impression is that it is definitely doing something. The smell isn&#x27;t bad for this type of product and actually smells pretty much on par with many regular shampoos. It has a piney smell that is definitely pleasant enough to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I say it&#x27;s definitely doing something, I mean I could actually feel stimulation in my scalp when I used it. My hair feels great afterwards and it seems very positive from the first use. As some others have said, it doesn&#x27;t lather up very much compared to other shampoos I&#x27;ve used, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s problematic. I had no problems working it into my hair, and my hair feels full and clean afterwards, so I think it&#x27;s doing a fine job cleaning my hair despite the lack of foaminess. Not all cleaning products have to foam so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much of an issue.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this shampoo when I bought it. Suprisingly, I started noticing results and fairly quickly at that! My hair is actually beginning to fill in a bit, feels moderately thicker and fuller! I am feeling blessed to have found Ultrax Hair Loss Shampoo!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my aunt. She just started using it the smell is strong but a nice smelling conditioner will easily mask that. She is seeing slightly less shedding and some improvement.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results when she&lt;br /&gt;finishes using the bottle.  I include some pics of the bottle that show more than the stock photo in the listing.</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a great aroma! It makes my hair feel clean and energized. I like it so much the first time I used it that I washed my hair twice with it. Makes my hair feel squeaky clean. I&#x27;m ready to start the day after I use it. My hair feels awesome all day. I cant wait to see the improvement it makes in my hair growth and the over all condition of it. Great Shampoo!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize a difference.</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo. It worked on my missing spots. It leaves your hair smelling great. My hair feels really healthy now and I am happy with this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually very skeptical about these hair growth products as many of them don&#x27;t actually work. A friend of mine suggested that I use the shampoo so I gave it a shot and have been using it for almost three weeks now. I can definitely see a lot less shedding especially when I am taking a shower. The shampoo is almost odorless with a light greenish clear color, but you can smell something fresh when you get your nose close to it. It gives a cool sensation when putting on your hair and scalp which just feels great. This shampoo really does work, and I will definitely continue using it to see more fascinating results. Highly recommended to those who are experiencing mild/severe hair loss.</li>
    <li> so i was a little skeptical about this product, i received early again ans once again i am super impressed.i actually do have damaged hair but most of this product made my hair feel soft and gave it a great sheen to it as far as my hair growing better after a couple of more weeks i will write another comment on it,so far so good</li>
    <li> Its been two days since im using this shampoo and its amazing!! honestly you can tell a volume difference in your hair from the first wash. Im still using it so im not sure about the hair growth yet... but just reading the ingredients its pretty decent. It has a citrusy smell to it and doesn&#x27;t foam a lot.;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had super-fine hair my entire life and have always had problems with volume and thickness. In addition, last year I got a pixie cut that I regret, so I&#x27;m a fan of anything that will make my hair grow fast. This is a great product for someone like me. I like that it stimulates growth PLUS ads thickness and volume. That&#x27;s a perfect combination.</li>
    <li> My husband used this evening and he is eager to see if it works. He has never tried any other products so at the moment there is nothing to compare it to.  But it smells ok and Im sure that its not going to be overnight before we see results. Good product so far.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product though Beuty Superstore online. I loved that I could use Amazon prime along with fulfillment though Amazon, and Beauty Superstore&#x27;s great price offer. Ok so now about the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a 43-year-old woman. Due to allergies etc I stay away from food such as onions and other products that contain sulphur, which from what I read and hear is an integral element in hair growth. Because of that my hair generally is weak, thin, and falls out quite easily. Generally I use natural shampoo that contains something called “awla” which has generally strengthened my hair in comparison to what it is naturally. I wanted to order something different that would also give a little volume to my hair. My friend already uses this product and loves it. So after reading reviews I bought this product. This product has, over the last few days of use (approx. 5) at least, definitely improved the strength of my hair. I do realize its too early for a dramatic change, but I do feel that my hair is shedding a LOT less. When I comb it in the morning, I notice less hair coming out in the brush or even on the floor. Now I cannot say whether this product exclusively is the cause behind my hair not falling off or not because there are just too many factors involved in hair not shedding off. Also this product hasn&#x27;t caused me itching or little blisters on my scalp which most other chemical products would typically cause. . However what I will definitely say is that this has to a large extent helped me. I will definitely update this review after around a month or two and hopefully the positive trend will continue.</li>
    <li> I gave this product only 3 stars because I&#x27;m not sure if it works but am giving it a benefit of a doubt.  Actually I had to return it as after ordering I found out I had skin lupus and this would not help.</li>
    <li> did not work for me...</li>
    <li> Wow I was expecting for this to have a smell but compared to other products I bought for thickening and growth of my hair I give this a 10. Product arrived ahead of time and well worth he money in quantity. Packaging was nice I have only tried a couple of days and already know I will use this product continuously over time.</li>
    <li> Hey y&#x27;all, I highly recommend giving this product a try if you have thinning hair. It even SMELLS invigorating and energizing. Get this on your hair, stat! it came when promised and was delivered intact (which is tough to do with a pump bottle).</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Shampoo is a great product!  I have noticed my hair has begun to grow back quickly and plus it smells great!  There is a slight tingly sensation when first applied and I was pleased to see my hair becoming fuller and with extra shine.  I will continue to use this shampoo as part of my daily hair maitinence.  l am giving it 5 stars and will be a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was a pleasant surprise!  The smell is light and very pleasant. I guess I wasn&#x27;t expecting that because I find myself smelling as much as I can when I am shampooing, surprised at how the smell is simply a nice clean smell.  The shampoo lathers great and the first time I used it, I could feel a slight tightening sensation on my scalp.  I have very fine hair that is past my shoulders and it tangles easy, and this shampoo has not been a problem at all.  The biggest advantage is I have felt this shampoo is assisting with some of the shedding that I experience when i come through -after the shower and I have only just started to use it!</li>
    <li> This is the miracle cure for thinning hair. The 3 ingredient formula give you results within just two weeks of use without loading up your hair with an endless line of chemicals. This bottle is all you need when it comes to hair loss and at this price there&#x27;s no reason everyone shouldn&#x27;t be using this fast acting, great smelling, and healthy feeling shampoo.</li>
    <li> Meh.  Just ok, haven&#x27;t seen any real difference.  Too little ketoconazole for male pattern baldness.  Although that explains why you can use it everyday, normally 1% or prescription 2% can irritate the scalp when used too much.  Honestly Ultrax products always seem to have too high of reviews/1 review people.  Hell look at their Ultrax Labs Hair Lush, 246 out of 258 are 5 star reviews.  Maybe its that good, but I doubt it.  Anyway, I&#x27;ll use it to the end of the bottle, but would buy it again especially at that price (I was actually lucky when they dropped it to $29 for a couple days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Too expensive compared to alternatives ($20-30 seems to be the norm, for awhile it was $49, now its down to $43)&lt;br /&gt;-Too little ketoconazole (advertised at .2%)&lt;br /&gt;- Not a good smell.  Smells kinda like household cleaner&lt;br /&gt;- lather is definitely not the best.  I would expect this from a Sodium Laurel Sulfate free product, but this DOES have Sodium Laurel Sulfate.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product. It really did what it promised. My hair is thinning and normally tangles very easily, and also falls out all over the place! From the very first time I used Hair Surge, I actually noticed a remarkable difference in my hair. Not only in how thick it appeared &amp; felt, but I usually have a lot of hair that falls out in the shower, right when I wash it, and then first comb it out, and that did not happen!  I didn&#x27;t use any kind of conditioner, just the shampoo, and I have no trouble combing it out while it is wet -- there are no annoying tangles. I have only used it a couple weeks now, so I honestly don&#x27;t know yet if I am getting any hair re-growth, but I intend to keep using this shampoo. I wear my hair long and silver -- I don&#x27;t use any hair coloring -- and this shampoo makes my hair look just beautiful. I do use hot rollers, but now my hair stays full of bounce right up to the next time I wash it, and it doesn&#x27;t even get tangled when I&#x27;m sleeping. The shampoo has no real scent to it, but I guess that is good since it is meant for both men and women to use, but I am used to shampoos smelling really good. I also wish Hair Surge weren&#x27;t so expensive, but I honestly do think it&#x27;s worth it. Except for the fact that I&#x27;ve gone completely grey, my hair actually looks healthier now than it did 15 years ago.</li>
    <li> Arrived early and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having hair loss issues at such an early age sucks, but i am glad I found a product right off the bat that works so well to bring my hair back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and lathers well, spreads well with very little shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week into use and from the results I&#x27;m getting with fuller hair and new hair growing back in, it is well worth the price!</li>
    <li> Ordered this product to enhance my daily shampoo and conditioner routine. Pump bottle makes it convenient to use only a dab at a time. Product has a strong mint smell; but I was worried it would smell like chemicals so I&#x27;m not disappointed.  I&#x27;ve noticed with only a few applications, my fine hair is thicker. I&#x27;m hoping with continued use this product will help my hair to grow longer as well, since it typically breaks off. If product continues to work as well as it has initially, I&#x27;ll make it part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I am excited about this shampoo with caffeine in it because recent studies I&#x27;ve heard about show that caffeine not only promotes the re-growth of hair, but also makes it grow longer and increases the life span of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular shampoo has a nice gender neutral scent, so both me and my boyfriend can use it. The pump also makes it handy to use when you&#x27;re in the shower. Plus, the Amazon price is good compared to other sources.</li>
    <li> this product does everything it says,,, I was skeptical at first , but after a few uses I noticed a difference in my hair, it has begun to grow back fairly fast and I love the smell and lather of this product. EC</li>
    <li> I was a little weary about spending this amount of money on a shampoo, but, this is my&lt;br /&gt;hair we are talking about!  While I have only been using the shampoo for a short amount of time, I really am seeing that it makes a difference.  The bottle claims that you’ll see results after the first use and I must say I was not disappointed.  My hair felt and appeared fuller and thicker and now after a few more days, I am seeing fine baby hair around my temples. I also like the lemony scent and the thick lather that this shampoo produces.  So far, so good.  I feel that this was money well spent for a quality product that is giving me the results I wanted.  When this bottle is gone, I’ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> Great product, purchased for my boyfriend, he loves this product.</li>
    <li> Patience is the key. The product does not work over night, but give it a few weeks and the results will show. I truly recommend this treatment if your hair is thinning and you&#x27;re concerned with hair loss.</li>
    <li> This product caught my eye, because it contains ingredients (Caffeine and Ketoconazole) that are supposed to promote healthy hair growth. So, I decided to give it a try for these benefits and because it has received so many positive reviews. Although, I have just started using it recently, I can already notice the difference in the fullness of my hair. I have observed a slight reduction of some of the usual shedding and breakage (due to years of over-processing).  With high hopes, I will continue using this product for a full month, to see if it lives up to its name.</li>
    <li> I first want to point out that I&#x27;m currently using this shampoo with Ultrax Hair Lush Serum. Although I can&#x27;t say, like some other reviews, that I&#x27;ve seen the difference within days or even notice a difference from the very first application, I can&#x27;t be spoiled because I did eventually notice the difference within 3 weeks of continuous use. Everyone is different and their reason for their hair loss vary by so many factors so that is a factor worth considering and perhaps why my results, (although still results), did not come as quickly as many other reviews on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first signs I saw happening after three weeks was the fact that my hair stopped falling out. I could usually run my fingers through my hair and easily find about 5 hairs on my palm EVERY TIME I ran my fingers through my hair. After three weeks, no matter how many times I run my fingers through it, I&#x27;m hard pressed to find even a single hair plucked out of my head. This is already a very noticeable difference. The week after, finishing off my first month of use, I started to notice my bald spots on my crown starting to fill out and in dramatic fashion. Everyday I&#x27;ve been excited to look in the mirror since to find that the bald spots are becoming harder and harder to notice as the hairs covering the spots are becoming more prevalent and darker. The initial excitement has lead me to write this review which I never do. Only time will tell how much better these results will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I wanted to point out that I use the shampoo everyday unlike the specified 5-days-a-week in the instructions. I figured you have to take a shower, (or rather one should), everyday anyway, I might as well keep using it every time. It seems to last quite a while anyway because I only need one pump to have enough of the product to cover my head probably because I have short hair. This is probably why it lathers so easily for myself as opposed to some who say that it&#x27;s hard to spread and work into a lather; their hair is probably much longer and/or fuller than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hair Lush Serum I use right after taking a shower. I need to use two pumps from the bottle to be able to have enough to use on my head. The whole process of using the shampoo and the serum all take place at night but I do however use the serum one other time in the morning before I go to work. This regiment worked for me. I&#x27;ve gone through about 5 different products though out the years, including Rogaine which I was allergic to, and now I finally found something that works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine hair, which has been a challenge for me my entire life. Sometimes even having to hide spots that are a bit thin with varying hair styles, especially when its \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried different types of hair thickening shampoos/mouses/gels etc to thicken my hair, but I didn&#x27;t like the results of those products. A lot of them make the hair sticky and others made it flaky etc which I really don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I really don&#x27;t like products that are complicated and difficult to use. This one is simple and straight forward, no hot oils to deal with etc, just use it like it&#x27;s shampoo. Of course, it&#x27;s higher priced than regular shampoo, but that&#x27;s to be expected, because it&#x27;s not just regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find all the \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; ingredients in it such as the Saw Palmetto, which is the ingredient that I think helps people with fine hair. I prefer things to be all-natural and although I wish it didn&#x27;t have the SLS, it is what makes the nice lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was skeptical to try it, but the 100% satisfaction guarantee by the company made me feel more comfortable to go for it and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to find it! It smells great too!</li>
    <li> All I can say is \\&quot;WOW\\&quot;! As a woman with dandruff, damaged, thinning/straight hair this product has done wonders for me in so many ways. My scalp has been completely nourished, my hair feels thicker and I&#x27;ve noticed that it no longer breaks easily! I no longer worry about my boyfriend skimming his fingers through my hair or feel the need to look for different hair styles or even wigs and extensions to make me feel secure in public. Thank you Ultrax Labs! You have helped make me a far more confident woman! I recommend this product to anyone who feels they have to hide their hair to feel confident. Time to get this, throw away those wigs and extensions, and show off your new lovely locks!.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it everyday and it make my hair soft, full, and shinny with no greasy feeling</li>
    <li> Like most people who bought this product I was been going natural and been having shedding problem and this has helped tremendously and it also leave my hair spelling good and soft witch is a plus I usually use just conditioners but now I make sure to included this</li>
    <li> I wore my hair in a ponytail too much and discovered a bald spot. So I was willing to give this a try. I&#x27;ve used it for my last 3 shampoos. The &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; seems to have lessened, and my bald spot is a bit less bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely thick &amp; a bit hard to get the lather going. My first time, I used about 10 pumps, as my hair is long, and left it on the instructed 2 min. My hair is also &amp;#34;enhanced&amp;#34; red. I noticed a lot of color bleeding with my first shampoo, and my ends felt extremely dry. I definitely cannot go w/o conditioner, but used a little extra that day. Lo &amp; behold, I was still red when my hair dried, and it didn&#x27;t feel damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used less the second and third shampoos, and shampooed only the scalp area, and used my regular shampoo on the length of my hair. I liked that method much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, but use it only on your scalp and expect a little color stripping.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for the best but did not know what to expect. Must say I am pleasantly surprised. Noticeably My hair started to break off while styling. Looks do matter, especially my hair. Healthy hair now. Cheers</li>
    <li> this shampoo has been a life saver for me, I had gotten really stressed out and started to loose my thick hair this shampoo brought it back to life its now all i use!!</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before, I didn&#x27;t think it would work, but it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve never seen my hair like this in ages. I&#x27;ve done so many things to my hair that it was thinning and breaking. I also had issues with dandruff and breakouts in my scalp, but this cools down my scalp and gives it this clean feeling after washing. It&#x27;s amazing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the price and size that it comes in. It&#x27;s too expensive for so little. Also the pumping is a bit difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, just needs to come in a more inexpensive, bigger size.</li>
    <li> My husband tried a lot of products just to get his hair back..ha ha! He even tried the one advertise on tv but ended up shipping it back again after 2 months because nothing happened. I saw this product here in amazon and was tempted to give it a shot. and guess what, it WORKS! WORKS! and WORKS..after two weeks of  using it, we noticed fine hairs that grows. Hmmp..amazing isnt it??&lt;br /&gt;He uses it everyday when he takes his shower and so far he likes it and very happy with it. He even recommended this to his friend also. We&#x27;ll keep using this product until our full satisfaction achieve. all worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times but I really didn&#x27;t like the way is made my hair feel and I have not noticed and hair growth at all not even slight.  Although I guess I haven&#x27;t really been consistent enough with it.  Would not buy again.  Also it was pretty expensive for a hair shampoo.</li>
    <li> shampoo lathers well and does not leave any oily residue. Has pleasant smell.Easy to apply with nozzle bottle.Concentrated so do not need to use a lot at a time.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a moderate period of time, I did notice an improvement in hair texture, although I am unsure of whether this shampoo was the cause or if the improvement was from the other products I began using at the same time. I liked the smell of the shampoo, but my hair seemed to feel grimy as soon as I rinsed it out and it left my hair feeling dirty all day long. I&#x27;d rate it as a little under decent, and definitely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Product is great. Have bought this item repeatedly and the results are fantastic. Leaves hair feeling smooth and voluminous. Have tried many but this is one of the best</li>
    <li> This shampoo is unbeleivable!! I is pricey but it really works! I love that it has a pump lid which makes it easy to use in the shower since the bottle is a little harder to handle in the shower. It&#x27;s very convenient and it works! My hair has filled in where it was begining to thin. I have used this for about 3 months now and I have noticeable results! I use it about 5 times a week for the best results. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to thickin their hair or just to make it grow. It even appears that my thinning has stopped or at least slowed down.</li>
    <li> I have a history of thin hair on my fathers side of my family and the results I have had with this product have been nothing short of amazing. For starters, I have tried multiple different hair growth shampoos and products from many retailers. What I found was that these products were often gimmicks that lacked real results and caused me to waste too much money. In the time I have had this shampoo, I have already noticed that my hair is starting to grow thicker and stronger than ever before. This shampoo actually works and I could not be happier. This product is well worth the price and I will definitely be ordering more when my current supply runs out.</li>
    <li> Awesome invention! Will be buying another one as soon as I finish this one.</li>
    <li> I was shedding toooo much hair on top of that my hair is straight and very thin especially at my hair line. I came across hair surge after searching for a solution. I couldn&#x27;t be happier ! My hair is improving, I see positive results. My hair is thicker and fuller. Very inexpensive than other products ive seen. Thank you !!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever had before! I feels great when I wash my hair and tingles as I scrub my scalp. It helps restore the hair that I lose when brushing. It also smells great and leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean. It is a little costly, but well worth the price and value. I will definitely buy this product again in the future!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days and I can feel it working already. Although, of course it will take time for hair to grow and become thicker. My scalp feels more stimulated(?) it definitely has a pleasant tingle when being applied. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the results a few weeks out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers nicely and is easily distributed to the hair and scalp, the scent is one you can expect from salon grade shampoos.</li>
    <li> IMPRESSED! This stuff WORKS. Just as well as prescription grade hair-loss shampoos. Well Worth the $50. Shampoo smells great &amp; You only need to use a small amount each wash. I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in volume &amp; thickness. My hair is so much stronger and Hair Surge is extremely moisturizing. My shower drain is no longer clogged from all the shedding. I Highly recommend to anyone who suffers from hair thinning and/or hair loss.</li>
    <li> Product seems to be working.</li>
    <li> So i love this product, Im a 37 year old female with really thin hair and now Im experiencing the unfortunate reality of my hair falling out but since I been using this my hair has triple in thickness and strength, specially when I am brushing it and my hair has dramatically dropped from falling out! So I am totally satisfied with it and would suggest trying it for anyone that suffers from thin falling out hair!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! Smells great and makes my hair look amazing! I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Hair Surge shampoo, like many quality shampoos, has a thick, silky consistency and light, fresh, clean scent. This shampoo is designed for those coping with hair thinning and loss. Hair surge is middle of the road as far as pricing for product, its not the cheapest thing, but it is certainly not most expensive thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on trying to stop thinning and hair loss myself...not only that, but this product does come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee, or your money back. Why not try it? Also,  Hair Surge contains ingredients beneficial to growing and maintaining healthy hair. Those are essential oils -- important for conditioning and moisturizing hair -- and caffeine compounds known to stimulate hair follicles so hair grows faster and to extend the hair lifecycle. The ingredient Ketoconazole, stunts hair loss by blocking testosterone, and another key ingredient, saw Palmetto, increases hair density. Like anything, it does take time and consistent usage and patience to see results. I have been using it for a month now and I am really starting to see a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this!! My hair is fuller and brighter than before! It doesn&#x27;t work over night, but it works fast and fantastically!! I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> My hair has less shedding and is definitely fuller. i really enjoy using this shampoo, make my scalp feel good. would use it again and i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Foremost, shipping was real quick; arrived in two days after purchasing. The package on the bottle looks high-quality and looks great. The scent on this shampoo is very unique, unlike any other shampoo I have used; reminds me of a pleasant herbal tea mixed with hints of peppermint. After rinsing the shampoo off I felt as if it dried out my hair a bit, but as soon as I got out the shower, dried and combed my hair it was very soft , bouncy and full of volume. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> So I was a bit skeptical, but I really like this stuff...&lt;br /&gt;I also am finding that as I get older, I am losing some of my hair.  I&#x27;m finding bigger clumps in the drain and I see in the mirror that it is definitely getting thinner.&lt;br /&gt;So the packaging on this stuff is really nice.  Comes in a nice colored bottle with a pump instead of squeezing it out.  It&#x27;s clear in color and actually smells clean with not too much scent so that it is too strong.  When applying the shampoo it feels super clean and smells really nice.  It seemed to absorb nicely.  The instructions say to keep in for a couple of minutes and I did.  It rinsed out nicely and my hair seems really clean since I started using it.  Although my hair feels clean, it doesn&#x27;t feel stripped like some shampoos make your hair feel.  It even has made my scalp less dry and my hair seems to be getting thicker.  I Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few months!  Seems like an awesome product that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Well, I must say that I did not have great expectations when I bought this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not inexpensive and to be honest I thought I might be tossing money out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a receding hair line (no shock as as I race towards 50) and until now I have been using thickening shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am just vein enough to care about losing my hair but not enough to jump hoops over it, so when I read the other reviews and understood it was not some multi step process, I though I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really glad I did. I have been using it for just about two weeks and I&#x27;ll be darned if I am not actually starting to get hair growth in the triangle areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other surprise for me is I actually like it as shampoo in general and my hair looks great. No weird chemical smell and not perfume. I just plain like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in another few weeks but so far, showering is a happy part of my day thinking my hair is getting thicker and not thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review a long time ago before I was really following reviews in general on Amazon. I am sorry that some of you thought this was a shill post. It was not. I used this for a good portion of the bottle and for me I was starting to get results but the trade off (for me) was that it also seemed to have a stripping effect on my very fine hair. So while I was starting to get growth, the overall effect for me was feeling like I had less hair. This could well be that I had been using a thickening shampoo for a long time and this was removing the build up but I couldn&#x27;t quite make the swing, worried I was still losing more volume as result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I had added a thickening conditioner and continued use longer it would have worked out better in the long run but I had other things to try that I hoped were a bit more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried Minoxidil which for me has/had an immediate thickening effect (as in thickener additive) but unfortunately the active ingredient (I assume it was that) didn&#x27;t agree with me longer term. I still use Minoxidil but only on occasion when I have to fix a bad hair day as I have not found a thickening foam that works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My apologies for not being more aware of the comment/questions in the past.hickener additive) but unfortunately the active ingredient (I assume it was that) didn&#x27;t agree with me longer term. I still use Minoxidil but only on occasion when I have to fix a bad hair day as I have not found a thickening foam that works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My apologies for not being more aware of the comment/questions in the past.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say it can grow hair, but after just a few days my scalp and hair are in better shape than they&#x27;ve been in a long time. My hair has a fuller, more healthy feel than previously.  This is better than both shampoo and conditioner.  So, save your money as you&#x27;re probably spending as much and this product gives great results.</li>
    <li> So far I am happy. I can see there is some little  tiny hairs poking thru where my hair is VERY thin and bald.  Ive tried everything, so I am a critic.  But so far this seems to be working and Ill definitely buy and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I will recommend this product for people who search and search for a product that works. You will see results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now. So far I have less breakage. I don&#x27;t really see a lot more thickness yet. I will continue to use it for another month to see if I notice any growth or thickness.</li>
    <li> I am using it for more than 2 months and honestly I think it was waste of money. I have  been using Nioxin and Bosley Bos Revive ( mostly Nioxin) Even though I didn&#x27;t see and expect a miracle, I think they did a good job to slow down the hair fall. But this super expensive shampoo is like the regular $5 shampoo  you  buy from Walmart and I wasted 43 dollars on this useless shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it is better than any other shampoos out there but you pay 10 times more for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is I will not waste my money again on expensive Ultra labs !!&lt;br /&gt;I do not not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> This might possibly be the best shampoo you can use for thinning hair. I figured if Im going to use a shampoo anyways might as well use one that helps with thinning hair.It makes my scalp feel good and does a nice job of thickening my hair. I have some thin areas on my crown and this shampoo makes the thinning less noticeable,a very good shampoo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its only been 3 weeks, and I havent noticed any revolutionary growth but what remains does feel more filled in and best of all I havent experienced ANY side effects. Shampoo smells and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;Basically at this point in my life Id be happy to KEEP what I already have, and to me thats success.</li>
    <li> This product is my savior to thinning hair , I would recommend trying it and seeing the great results.</li>
    <li> This works great. It does exactly what I bought it to do. My hair looks better and much fuller!</li>
    <li> Amazing Price for great product and SUPER FAST SHIPPING. This is a great PRICE!!!! Can&#x27;t wait to share with friends the great offer and did I mention the GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> Hair growth started immediately. I could feel small hairs that would not have been there without this shampoo. It smells nice too so you don&#x27;t have to worry about having a weird odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urge you to get this over a cheaper alternative. Don&#x27;t waste money on ineffective shampoos, just get this one.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the product all that long but I feel that I am already noticing a difference.  My hair feels stronger and thicker.  The best thing about my results is the comments I am getting from casual acquaintances.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar items and although they make my hair feel nice, I have never noticed any real hair regrowth. This product actually works! Noticed baby fine hairs coming in after only 2 weeks of use. If you&#x27;ve ever experienced hair loss you know that the price is worth it. Love the way it lathers and makes my fine hair feel manageable too.</li>
    <li> Smells like car cleaner</li>
    <li> Worked on my thinning hair</li>
    <li> I fell for the false reviews. This made my hair fall out. Amazon needs to pull this product ASAP.</li>
    <li> This product My name is Lisa Rosario, this shampoo is great it gave my hair more volume and made my hair more thick, it also added shine, excellent.</li>
    <li> Ir didn&#x27;t work for me sorry</li>
    <li> just what i needed  my hair was bad</li>
    <li> Sad to say but it&#x27;s NOT WORKING:&#x27;(&lt;br /&gt;1st time user but im gonna give another try.</li>
    <li> I felt it working right away. My hair feels thicker and stronger and healthier. When shampooing, I can feel a tingling feeling which makes me feel great,. The condition of my hair looks much better, noticeably shinier. It has not looked that way in a long time. It is a very refreshing product. I was skeptical, but now am very convinced.  It also helped to boost my confidence as my hair got thicker. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far, so good... The shampoo latters well, and my hair does appear to have thicken a little. I will finish the bottle , and buy another. as these things take time! I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m unhappy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to pills, plugs, wigs and weave. Stress was the cause of my thinning hair, which is normally thick and strong. I purchased because I heard caffeine is a great stimulator. I have noticed results after a few weeks of using it. My friend was balding as well, used the shampoo and is noticing a few results, his hair line is thicker. I love that the bottle is designed for the shower, with the pump dispenser. The con&#x27;s are the smell, lack of lather and the price is a bit steep. You get what you pay for and I gave this 5 stars because it actually works.</li>
    <li> The size of this bottle for the price is ridiculous..I just got mine as a gift and I wouldn&#x27;t have put it on my wishlist If I had realized it would be $43 for such a small bottle.</li>
    <li> I just noticed that all high reviews from this product are spam. Click one of the high reviews and you will noticed that they rated HAIR MAXX ULTRAX LABS (same company) a positive review probably is the company making a fake review so you can push you to buy it.</li>
    <li> This medicated shampoo is the best product I&#x27;ve tried to halt my hair loss and keep my scalp healthy. In the past I&#x27;ve used prescription products which were only disappointing and expensive. My thinning hair has been progressively oily, wiry fine, and so brittle. Worse, plenty of relentless shedding with no hair regrowth in ever expanding sections. Fortunately, I finally tried this shampoo and normally use just a small amount five days a week for my hair loss with some positive developments so far. The most obvious is I&#x27;m keeping more of my hair now with some areas in the back growing longer, while the hairs are visibly thicker. And my fiance&#x27; affirms she notices fewer hairs on our pillows and in the bathroom. She would know.    I think the key is this formula does a great job of solving my oily scalp breakouts that, I suspect, are responsible for my hair follicle deterioration. No more itchy/flaky scalp and overall, I think, more healthful, since that oil that oozes out has mostly ceased or is cleared away by this shampoo when it does erupt. I&#x27;d say this has to be conducive to hair growth in itself. A vital follicle is a productive follicle-- meaning the hair has its best chance to grow naturally-- and this shampoo is making that difference for me.  I&#x27;m satisfied that right now it allows me to maintain what I do have and confident, based on what I&#x27;m seeing so far, with long term use it will allow me to regrow fuller hair.</li>
    <li> I have used my shampoo a few times since receiving it and I&#x27;ve already begun to notice the strands of hair on my head feel fuller and stronger. Of course  I haven&#x27;t experienced any significant hair growth yet, but my scalp feels wonderfully tingly after every use. I don&#x27;t know the last time my scalp felt this alive.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> Unlike what others are saying about the slow growth i have seen results in 1 week. I seen less shedding and i love the fact that it was a decent price for such a good product. would definitely  recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Hair grow back again!</li>
    <li> I like this product because I was having shedding problems. I been a natural for 3 years. I shampoo hair twice I use the shampoo for a  couple days straight.It had nice smell. My hair felt very soft and my scalp feels clean an refresh not itchy.Less shedding. It was worth every penny. Give this shampoo a chance help your hair shine. ade me wish i brought the conditioner as well. It is worth every cent.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Shampoo! After the first use I could see a difference. It has a nice smell too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Feels great on my scalp, and has already shown to help strengthen my hair. Will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. I been using it for over a month now. No hair growth was visible and i didnt see any change in my loss of hair either. All that shampoo does is makes your hair puffy and it gives it volume. In another words, it makes you believe that your hair is thicker and that shampoo is working. SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS IS A SCAM PRODUCT. ALL THOSE 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE FAKE.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and can notice a difference in my hair. My hair feels more managable and maybe even a bit thicker.  The bottle it comes in is great and easy to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair and am always looking for products that will give me fuller, thicker hair. This shampoo is amazing. My scalp felt all nice and tingly after using it and I noticed a change immediately. My hair was noticeably fuller! I actually get excited when my alarm goes off in the morning because it means it&#x27;s time to use my new shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair so I tend to shed a lot after each shampoo but with this Ultax shampoo, I&#x27;ve seen a significant decrease in hair falling out after a shower.  I love that it comes with a pump so I can get just the right amount out.  Also, a little goes a long way with this product so I can imagine this bottle lasting a few months.  It will work up a good lather with just a little bit.  I was concerned that this would have a horrible scent like many other hair growth shampoo&#x27;s, but this stuff had a fresh, clean scent.  Highly recommend to anyone with shedding or hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the scent! It feels like a regular shampoo and definitely works! It does exactly what it says it does!</li>
    <li> This is a product that I would recommend to anybody that has thinning hair. It&#x27;s way better than that stuff I bought at the local drug store. My hair is thicker and has more volume than ever. i can feel it working hours after I step out of the shower. Thank you Ultrax.</li>
    <li> This product really did the job for me, my hair feels great since I have been using it an it looks great too! I was a little skeptical at first to try it but since it was recommended to me from a great source I decided to give it a try. I have noticed significant results with my hair. I have less shedding. It was totally worth my time to purchase this product, and the best part is that my hair looks and feels amazing. The bottle is also a great value because of the size I know that It will last me a long time. I look forward to continue using this product because I know my hair will continue to improve.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom who sadly has to deal with the discomfort of thinning hair.  She really likes this shampoo! She enjoys the scalp stimulating benefits of the essential oils, which include menthol, peppermint oil and saw palmetto. I had not seen her for a couple of weeks and was pleasantly surprised by the thicker, healthier and more luxurious look of her hair. She is thrilled because having tried a few other shampoos and conditioners did not see any results so Mom is sold on Hair Surge. She is pleased and will buy the shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Well I got this shampoo in hopes of bringing back some life to the middle if my head. Hair thinning is genetic in my family and when I noticed my hair falling victim I thought I would do what my dad didn&#x27;t think of and try to do something about it. So going through my options I saw this product. Now I didn&#x27;t immediately jump on this because there are other products like this and cheaper. But you get what you pay for. I bought another product that was cheaper with promising results and saw no results after two months use. So I gave this shampoo a shot thinking the same would happen. First off the lather is rich and smells pleasant. It isn&#x27;t thin and it doesn&#x27;t take much. Also I felt the shampoo tingling as I agitated my scalp. After about a month I could visibly notice and so could my dad. My middle is definitely getting fuller and I am still using it hoping things continue to improve. But I believe I&#x27;ve found what I was looking for. It&#x27;s well worth the price and is gentle on the scalp. Got my brother some even though he isn&#x27;t losing yet. I wish I would have had it a few years ago. It would have saved a lot of hat time.</li>
    <li> Please do not buy. First time use made my scalp dry and break out all over. Intense redness and scalp pain all over for couple of days. Horrible experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this product the 29th of September with the hopes of it working.  I&#x27;ve used similar products in the past and they were hit and misses.  I was skeptical at first but after seven days of using Hair Surge, I can honestly see the difference.  I didn&#x27;t see much change in day 1 and day 2 but I think maybe it was from staring to much.  When I came back back after a week, my wife even told me my hair looked thicker.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and will definitely order again.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Used for 3 months.  Has exponentially slowed the loss of hair, and fine areas along the hairline are beginning to fill in.  Good option for those in the EARLY stages of male pattern baldness.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this product because it had good product reviews.  I purchased this product, Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo for my boyfriend who is 54 years old and has a receding hairline baldness runs in his family.  The Shampoo is working great he is very pleased with the results he has noticed some hair growth.  He had considered getting a hair transplant but it is so expensive I suggested we try this first.  I was hesitant at buying this at first because I was not sure the Ultra Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulant would work as expected but we were pleased.  We will be buying another bottle.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing hair loss or hair thinning.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo that not only improves hair growth but is also a great product!  It is difficult to find a hair product that does not dry out your hair but instead keeps it feeling smooth all day until now.  It works well for thickening hair and also helps minimize a flaky scalp.</li>
    <li> this product is awesome, i was skeptical about it, but my hair felt thicker after a few washes. And it also made my hair feel soft and look shiny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using this product and it is amazing. I love the smell and that it leaves my hair feeling clean. It doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; smell or feel to it either like some others. I would definitely recommend it to any fellow &amp;#34;shedders&amp;#34;or those who&#x27;ve noticed some thinning.</li>
    <li> I had been shopping around looking for something to help me regain some hair loss that I was experiencing.  After looking and doing a lot of research I decided to give the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo a try.  The cost is a bit more than I normally spend on shampoo, however I realized that I needed to find something that address my problem of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Being in my mid 50&#x27;s I fully realized that if I did not do something to curtail my hair loss it would just get progressively worse as I get older.  I am beyond thrilled with this shampoo.  After using it for just 4 days  straight I could see and feel the difference in my hair.  My hair looks and feels so much fuller and stronger than ever and it leaves my hair and scalp feeling so so clean.  I love it.  I follow the makers instructions to a tee, using it 5 days a week, and it really does work.  I am most excited about having my hair back to looking like it was in my twenties and also it is well worth the price.  Having Ultrax Labs shampoo as part of my health care regimen leaves me feeling great and one less thing to worry about as I get older.  Thank you Ultrax Laboratories for having this shampoo for me as well as so many others who experience hair loss.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore my Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo. It was the very  essential need for my thinning refused to grow hair. I noticed how my best friend hair was thickening up and growing like weeds. So I was always using my best friends bottle of Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo and my hair stop shedding, it thickened up, and the growth was phenomenal. I decided to purchase my own. My hair continues to grow beautifully and healthy and I have volume!!! I love the way it makes my hair feels and smells, fresh and clean. So does my boyfriend! ;-)</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It was surprising that it worked on my &amp;#34;course&amp;#34; hair.  I tried this product to help with my hair breakage.  I have active children and sometimes over exert myself.  This shampoo has helped me maintain less shedding of my hair and even nourishes my dry scalp.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have notices the changes of less hair as I comb my hair.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Product is very good at what it does. I was recommended the product and have used before. It really helps with hair growth and stimulating the hair follicles. Great price as retail stores charge more. Great service. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the money! It owns up to what it says it can do! Will be buying this again! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a couple months now and have not noticed any difference.  If anything it looks like I&#x27;ve lost more hair.  Going to look for a better product as this one doesn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
    <li> I used it for 3m and did not see have any effect.  In my case it was a total waste of $49. However, I think it may work for other folks.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this shampoo because i have thick, coarse hair (I&#x27;m African American) but I&#x27;m here to tell you this stuff works for all hair types. About two years ago my edges started thinning, to the point where it almost looked as if my hairline was receding. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks and I can certainly tell the difference as there is hair where there wasn&#x27;t hair before! I only used the shampoo about 4 or 5 times out of the week --as directed--so I&#x27;m excited to see it&#x27;ll last me for a little over a month. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> My hair has always been on the thinner side and since I have long hair, I feel like it is always falling out! Using this product, my hair falls out less and I am left with thicker hair. Just what I needed!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had thinning hair problems since early 30s and after trying multiple hair regrowth products pretty much gave up on them. Ultrax delivers noticeable improvement within a week. Very excited to keep using it, can&#x27;t wait to see more!</li>
    <li> This shampoo did not work at all. I read a lot of good things about caffeine but sadly this was ineffective. I believe the caffeine content is too small in this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this does anything at all. I noticed no difference in my hair, and it didn&#x27;t impress me that there were mis-spellings in the instructions/contents on the back of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this shampoo.  It does what it says it does! I can actually see a difference. My hair is getting fuller!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks, but so far, I really like Hair Surge. Glad it was recommended to me.  Will order more today.</li>
    <li> I got this when I started thinning out thanks to a really stressful job, and two weeks later I literally saw a noticeable difference. About a month later my hair was a lot thicker, talk about a good way to spend money. I am never going to be that bald guy, haha. I&#x27;m going to try it on my beard next, one side of my face has always been thinner than the other...</li>
    <li> I loved this product the moment I tried it. Like the title suggests, you will experience a Hair Surge. You&#x27;ll know this shampoo is working as you&#x27;re massaging it through your hair and experience the most soothing tingling sensation. Like a cool breeze running through your hair, but in a hot shower. It also helps that this shampoo has such a wonderful and interesting scent to it. After my hair was dry I could feel the difference. Before even styling or straightening it I could feel the difference in texture of my hair. This shampoo, after one use with no conditioner, provided a smoother texture, more volume, movement, and an easier time managing my hair. The caffeine really seemed to bring my hair to life. I would recommend to anyone who has struggled with damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I gave this product a shot even though it was very expensive.  The bottle that it came in was quite small for the price, and I use it 7 times a week.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 1/2 months and haven&#x27;t seen any change yet.  I will update this review in another month and a half which will put my use at 3 months and see if any hair growth occurs.  I am using this in conjunction with Rogaine.  The pump gets stuck with mine and is also a bit annoying, although I am assuming this was just a manufacturing mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it has a nice &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; smell to it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in January with high expectations because of the reviews. After three months I can honestly say that I see no difference whatsoever! It doesn&#x27;t lather and makes what hair I have feel thin and lifeless. I&#x27;ve gotten better results from Pantene for a fraction of the cost. For almost $50 I expected at least some kind of noticeable results. WRONG! It&#x27;s nothing but snake oil.</li>
    <li> Okay! Call me cray if you want...i purchased this product because I saw that its main ingredient was caffeine. I have strong hopes in any product with caffeine. I too bought some of the Hair Maxx Pills and was satisfied with the results. I never thought to buy a shampoo. I always buy and stock up on pills and supplements online or in my local dietary shoppe. So i figured to give this a try. I love it honestly. The shampoo can be used on men and woman so that is a plus. I also saw a comment about someone loosing hair after using this product. I have not lost any hair. I&#x27;m think maybe that sounds like an allergic reaction. Everyone&#x27;s skin and hair follicles are different. But i would surely recommend this shampoo to people looking for something different than just pills and supplements. Its a really great way to promote hair growth to your roots, reduce hair loss, and feel good. the smell is okay. it doesnt stink. i thought it would because of the caffeine. but surprisingly it does not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this, but it already seems that my hair is thicker and healthier looking. I&#x27;ve tried other similar products, but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference and ultimately, quit using them. You only need a small amount, so this bottle should last you a good amount of time before needing to replenish. It lathers nicely and smells very clean. It is perfect for men or women because it doesn&#x27;t smell overly masculine or feminine. I love the pump lid, as well. So far, no complaints and I am satisfied with this purchase. I intend to reorder.</li>
    <li> My hair has become fuller and healthier since using this product for about a month. I do need to alternate shampoos however every 3rd or 4th wash, otherwise my hair startes to look matted down and somewhat oily. Sticking to that regime appears to work well for me though.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo when I noticed my hair thinning out.  I wanted to jump on the problem before it got any worse.  I saw some great results after a very short amount of time.  My hair was thicker and seemed to be growing in faster then usual.  I am so glad I found this shampoo it has been a life saver.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I have great hair and so do two of my daughters but my oldest just cannot grow her hair out.  I&#x27;ve been told many different things from stylist abought cutting it every six weeks or more, changing her diet and so on.  Nothing has worked.  This shampoo reduces hair loss while stimulating hair growth!  I expected it to stink or be a pain to use but it smells nice and you use it just like regular shampoo.  I know it&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I am very choosy about my hair care products.I have had constant issues with hair loss / hair thinning and itchy scalp.I have used multiple products for my issue over time and did not really like any of them because I wasn&#x27;t making any real progress.This product was recommended to me by a friend of mine.After extensive research, I decided to give it a try.After using it for a few weeks, I am definitely very impressed with this shampoo.I use this shampoo (by itself) every alternate day, massaging the shampoo for about 5-6 minutes before rinsing.After using this shampoo consistently for a few weeks, I can definitely see all the difference.My hair loss has significantly receded and I also see my hair growing back.I no longer have an itchy scalp and my hair looks healthy, lustrous and strong.This shampoo has a thick, consistent texture and decent scent.This is definitely THE PRODUCT I was looking for treating my hair loss.I would highly recommend this shampoo because it works!!</li>
    <li> Who would think that caffeine is good for hair?! But it works great. I have dull hair that only seems to grow just above shoulders and falls out. But when I washed my hair with this shampoo, my hair looked so shiny and it seems to be thicker and longer! It also smells good, which is a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my fianc&amp;eacute;. First, I really like the push-top, for easy use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Has a very neutral scent, which is great! For the price, the product is definitely worth it. He uses it 5 days a week and has noticed less shedding. Looking forward to buying my next bottle and seeing even better long term results!</li>
    <li> I am so happy I finally found a product that works. I have thin straight hair and after two weeks my hair started growing back! I am also thrilled that my hair stopped falling out after just a couple of uses. The bottle is a decent size and should last exactly one month. It has a good lather and a very neutral smell. (Important to me) It felt like my scalp was tightening a little when  use it and it gets rid of scalp oil. I have dry skin so I use conditioner afterwards and it balances out very nicely. Now that I know it works I plan on buying some for my mom who has just started growing hair back after she finished chemo a month ago. I am sure she will feel like a million bucks after she uses this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Expensive, small, doesn&#x27;t lather, doesn&#x27;t seem to clean, and most importantly doesn&#x27;t seem to improve hair</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help my hair sustain its life and give it some shine and volume I was having so many problems finding something that would help my hair from thinning and help with the flacks so I talked to a friend that was having similar problems and he recommended Ultra Labs Hair Surge  I was skeptical at first but after just a week of usage I noticed a dramatic difference and now that I have continued to use it my hair is looking healthier and feeling stronger and I don&#x27;t have to deal with dandruff cramping style</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product from this vendor. After searching around, I am glad I went with this. The price is worth it, and the shipping and response is great. Wonderful information here. Be sure to check out the questions for any answers you may be seeking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend you work with patience, as rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day... But your hair can grow back in less than a month :). My roommate especially has noticed results with his Ultrax Surge Caffeine shampoo</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this product and recommend this product.  Defiantly a good buy and will be re buying it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a great shampoo to purchase and I did! Great Smell and leaves my hair clean and manageable. My hair looks and feels wonderful! I am totally impressed with the quality and price!</li>
    <li> Is very good, really work, for my mom growth new hair she use for 2 months!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that it can work but my girlfriend and my co-workers who do not know that I have began to use this shampoo had noticed that my hair changed. I noticed myself that previously weak white hair becomes thick and dark. It does not help to grow new hair but it definitely treat old ones.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just amazing. I have tried using hair skin and nail vitamins, prenatals, all sorts of stuff.. But hands down this stuff worked the best!! Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My first impression was, darn, the bottle is so tiny.  8 oz is actually not that much and was so darn expensive for something that may or may not work.  Might as well just buy some cheap 99 cent shampoo and add some dissolved caffeine pills to it.  Probably would work better and you would only have to spend a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> The ultrax line of products is the only thing that seems to help a receding hair line / balding crown area. I have tried products from bosley, nioxin and ds labs. Maybe its my specific genetics and hair type but I will continue using this for now. A bit pricey but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this shampoo smells great and leaves your scalp &#x27;tingling&#x27; after which is a great sensation.  I typically leave it in prior to showering, for around 5-10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have the shampoo, conditioner, and hair growth supplement from this line.  The shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean, light weight, and manageable.  It does not feel like other hair growth shampoo.  A little goes a long way with this shampoo even for longer hair.  I am using this to help my hair post pregnancy.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in the next 3 months.  Right now I am very pleased.  Great value!</li>
    <li> If you suffer from thinning hair, this product will be an invaluable addition to your regimen.  It doesn&#x27;t lather like a traditional shampoo, but it does tingle and has a kind of invigorating scent.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less shedding.  This product was a great find!</li>
    <li> Bought this with the conditioner.  My hair stopped breaking after use.</li>
    <li> Anyone facing thinning hair should give this shampoo a try.This product literally wakes up your hair!  Took years off of my hair just after the first few uses, not only does this shampoo give you fuller, thicker hair but also hastens your hair growth!  Love the pleasant smell of this shampoo and it does not dry out your hair (like some other shampoos that I have tried in the past).  With age comes hair loss and hair thinning and this shampoo seems to be a great remedy to reverse that!</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my husband who has very little hair at this point, but I also started using it myself.  I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week and have noticed thicker, fuller hair.  The smell is very natural, almost minty.  It does not sud up like regular shampoo but you can tell it&#x27;s still getting your hair clean.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product came packaged in a standard &#x27;plastic wrapped to a piece of cardboard&#x27; way. There was no box (though, really, none necessary.)    The bottle is nice and sturdy feeling. The pump could be better, but it gets the job done.    The shampoo smells nice and creates a great lather. It&#x27;s not too foamy like many shampoos and a pump or two can easily work it&#x27;s way through all your hair. Even after the first use I noticed a difference with my hair. I can&#x27;t say for sure that it&#x27;s thicker, but it&#x27;s different in a good way. My hair felt clean (which is important) and kept it&#x27;s shape after it dried. After a couple uses my hair does, indeed, seem thicker as I run my fingers through it.    I have not yet bought the matching conditioner, but even without it my hair feels smooth, thick, and clean. I would certainly use this product again!</li>
    <li> While I haven’t experienced anything groundbreaking yet, I do like the way this shampoo smells and it seems to work just as well as Rogaine in thickening up my hair.  Keeping my fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> I had a great experience with this product. withing short period of time i have notices that my hair stopped falling out. I can see little hairs coming out. The hair became shiny and volume. Definitely a great improvement. I cannot wait to  see future results.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great at adding body and limiting the amount of hair loss and shedding I was experiencing. Hair definitely feels thicker. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I trust nothing until it is proven to me and this product has done just that.  Within a couple days the fullness started becoming more apparent.  The lather is full and the smell is pleasant (reminds me of peppermint).  I liked how it uses simple ingredients like Saw Palmetto, Peppermint, Mango and other natural herbs.  What they say is true, you get what you pay for and this is well worth the money invested (This is not an $8 bottle at Wal-Mart).  I wish they had an auto ship policy to make it easier on me.  In addition my scalp feels much better than it has, must be the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I got this for one of my good girlfriends who has been suffering from hair loss for a few months now. I knew she would never try something like this so I got for her and now she is glad I did because she said she is already seeing new growth that look like baby hairs! Im sure she will buy herself a bottle after this one is done!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, he feels very positive about it.  The moment he rubbed it on to his scalp he said he felt a tingling sensation.  Almost like to was already working.  I definitely recommed it to anyone who has hair loss problems.  My husband recommeds it with gusto!  Leaves a fresh feeling all over the scalp.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the real deal. After one week of use I&#x27;m already getting results. Way less shedding and my hair feels stronger than ever. The caffeine and essential oils really seem to be key in hair recovery</li>
    <li> This is amazing product from the day one! I was desperate to cover my balding spots with hair pieces but I was losing hair so much I couldn&#x27;t even clip on my existing hair until I shampooed my hair with this. I opened my 2nd bottle 5 days ago and now I don&#x27;t have to wear hair pieces anymore..I am using 3 products from this company at the same, and overall my hair looks much better and new growth are coming out.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it is much cheaper than other products of the same type and works way better, I noticed a difference only a couple weeks after i origanly starting using it, My girlfriend did as well and she is very happy with the results, I love this stuff and its the only product i will use.  thanks Ultrax labs your a life saver.</li>
    <li> I thought would be better</li>
    <li> Noticing that I was losing hair slowly at a young age was a huge concern of mine, and I wasn&#x27;t trying to go so far to try intense chemical products that don&#x27;t work. The idea of a caffeine formula shampoo to stimulate my hair growth and stop my loss sounded great, plus I&#x27;ve heard positive reviews of this brand before so I tried it... The result is that I love the product, as a shampoo and as a hair growth stimulator. Within a few days my hair felt much more full and has a good scent to it. It&#x27;s really a two for one deal because you get a great shampoo and a great stimulator, so it doesn&#x27;t take time out of your day putting nasty chemicals in your hair that most likely don&#x27;t even work. Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product that works as advertised.  Fragrance is better than expected.  Hair definitely feels healthier.  Not sure about growing new hair yet but I am able to keep the hair I have.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I felt the shampoo working in my hair the moment I started using it. It has a pleasing aroma and I like the thick, gel-like consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely met my expectations!!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a long time for a product that would regrow my hair and i have finally found it. I have tried many remedies to regrow my hair but was unsuccessful. When i started using Ultra Labs hair surge i noticed visible results in just 2 weeks of using it consistently. I am so looking forward to the many more results that this product will give me. This product gave me my confidence back. I recommend this to anyone who wants to see hair growth in a short period of time. Thanks Ultrax labs for making an amazing product!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but this shampoo is great. It leaves my hair and scalp squeaky clean and adds shine and thickness to your hair.the ingredients in this shampoo are awesome and I strongly suggest for everyone to try it at least once. I ve also been seeing baby hairs sprout up in some weak spots. Even my wife tells me how much better my hair looks after using this shampoo. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it since they have a money back guarantee. I haven&#x27;t ask for any money back so that should tell u everything ! This is the only shampoo I ll be using from now on. No regrets</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results. I just started using this product and I already see results. Less shedding already! I would recommended this to anyone who is suffering with hairloss.</li>
    <li> Once I got my package I used it immediately following all the instructions to the letter. The tingling sensation felt great and the smell is nice it lathers super good I let it sit in my hair for about 3 to 5 minutes and I must say my hair looked more healthier at that moment. I myself am a lace wig wearer and I have a few bald spots and breakage on my natural hair like actually bad bald spots no hair at all. Once I completed my wash and rinse I had peach fuzz (hair) in my non hair area this is amazing and Worth The Price. I am sold not only for the softness healthier looking part but it grew my bald spots where there was no hair no life or hope I&#x27;m feeling and loving this in my hair world .thumbs up new customer forever.It really works I love it  ,Thank you now I can finally be able to wear my real hair for once this product is a blessing in a bottle and I am a happy to have it and will continue to use it</li>
    <li> I have honestly tried every single shampoo there is to help with my hair loss and the ugly split ends each one seemed to be a waste of my time and money. Then I discovered this miracle, I now have longer and beautiful fuller hair. This product really works wonders.</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews i decided to try out this product by ultrax. It lathers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair too much. The smell is decent, and washes out all residue thoroughly.  This product takes time before you will see any noticeable results, as i saw results after using it for 5-6 weeks. At the moment this shampoo seems to be helping with my hair loss, so i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo for myself and my husband, who&#x27;s in his late fifties. I&#x27;m in my late forties and noticed that although I have a lot of hair, it&#x27;s thinning. I wanted something that would help retain my hair and help grow new hair. I did some research and found good reviews on this shampoo. I know it&#x27;ll take some time before I notice a big difference in my hair, but I&#x27;m happy with the shampoo so far. It lathers up pretty good, and my hair feels soft. I was a little worried how it might smell, but it has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast! Even faster than I expected, which was great so I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to use the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Leaves my hair thick and shiny. Also, it has a pleasant smell - not overpowering, just kind of nice. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle. The shampoo smells great with a very faint fragrance and leaves your hair feeling clean and refreshed. Some hair growth shampoos I have used in the past smell awful and left my hair feeling dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first bottle I see where my hair thinning has stopped and some new growth starting. I will keep using and hope to continue to see the same results!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything after 2 weeks.  It looks and smells like tree sap.  It doesn&#x27;t feel good when I lather it in my hair (my hair gets all tangled when I lather).  I&#x27;ve tried this, Bosley, and Lipogaine.  None of them seem to work, however I like LIpogaine big 3 the best because of the smell and it feels nice when I lather it in my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so soft and wonderful after using this shampoo. Not only does my hair feel good, but it looks better also. Other shampoos end up drying my hair out and making it feel like straw. But this shampoo was worth the money. I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair. The short time I&#x27;ve been using this I can see some improvement in my hair. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my hair is in a month or two.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using this shampoo, my hair grows longer, thicker and healthier than it did before. I love that it&#x27;s just a shampoo, not something that requires a million steps to get the results. It also hasn&#x27;t done anything to affect my hair negatively, it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or leave it oily. I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It really helped me!</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was apprehensive about the shampoo. I have been thru multiple shampoos all promising the same results to give no results.  So I took a chance and ordered the Ultrax Lab Surge. The day we received the shipment I tried it. My scalp felt clean but I still needed a good week to see if I felt or could see results.&lt;br /&gt;Well Ultrax Surge has exceeded my expectations after the 3rd day. The third day I went to meet with some friends and two immediately asked if I had put some extensions in my hair. They said my hair looked fuller and longer. I am now a huge huge fan of this product and will be adding it to anyone I know that is loosing hair&#x27;s Christmas list. Must buy!!</li>
    <li> Product is as described. After a week, I noticed changes in hairless. Works as a nice lather as well. Leaves hair feeling great, and the waxup building on the scalp is gone as well. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had very thin hair that came off a lot when I washed in the shower, until I started using this shampoo for 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy Rogaine that didn&#x27;t work for me, and I had been using a lot of hair sprays to make my hair look thicker every day. Of course, it had been taking so much time and trouble in my life... I wasn&#x27;t even sure if $50 shampoo will ease my situation, because other hair care products I was using costed more. However, using a few products and every day efforts are finally over!! I&#x27;m impressed how caffeinated shampoo could actually get my hair thicker and stronger. In my case, I could already tell my hair had been changing after using it a few times. It&#x27;s been about a month since the first use, and I thought I would write a review on this because I really wanted to mention it to people who are having problems like I did. Hair loss could be a real distress to some people.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is stably thick and strong now, and the texture is super! My hair doesn&#x27;t come off much in the shower anymore. My life has gotten so much easier.. I really thank this shampoo. This shampoo smells fresh and clean, too.&lt;br /&gt;If you are using other hair loss/growth products that are not giving you much results, I strongly recommend to try this shampoo once.</li>
    <li> I have just started to use this product and i already like the way my hair looks, it looks healthy. My hair always been very thin but by the way this shampoo is going so far i know that it will be thicker in a few more uses. Also, It smells great. I really love this product and I don&#x27;t even have one bad thing to say about it. This product is helping me save my hair and I will continue using it and recommending it to others !!</li>
    <li> Amazing is the best word to describe this shampoo!! I have been searching and trying out so many hair growth products and this actually works!! I have been struggling with shedding hair for quite some time and this was just what I needed. You will notice less shedding and this will not dry out your hair (no matter your hair texture). It does not smell bad and I love the tingly sensation it gives my scalp; like you can FEEL it working.  If your hair goal is longer, fuller, voluminous hair, I would highly recommend this product and stick with it...Your hair will grow!!!! Worth every penny...</li>
    <li> Awesome Hair Care Product. Not a single complaint, Works well and is greatly priced too. Would recommend to anyone experiencing problems with hair loss/thin hair.</li>
    <li> This Hair Surge is amazing. I&#x27;ve had this product for just a little bit and it is working tremendously. This is a very good product if you find your hair not growing or needs to be thicker. I started using this product and within just a two days, I saw a huge difference. I works well on my type of hair and would believe it works on all types of hair. I had thin hair and this product made me hair thick. My hair was shredding before I started using this product and now I don&#x27;t see any shredding at all. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody. If you&#x27;re looking for the right hair growth product, look no further.</li>
    <li> Bottom line it worked and saved the day for me.  I don&#x27;t have thinning hair, in fact I have very thick hair, however I made the mistake of skipping the salon to save money and colored my hair at home...I did not like the color that turned out  so immediately put on the stuff that takes the color out.  Well to my horror, when I rinsed my hair after the color remover, literally hair was falling out into the shower.  It just pulled out in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards my hair was almost airy light. To say it was fried is not an exaggeration. I googled shampoo for hair loss and also caffeine shampoo and came across this product. I did my own research on does caffeine shampoo work for hair loss and feeling pretty satisfied with what I found I bought the Ultrax Lab Surge Caffeine Shampoo.  My hair felt better after the first wash, but by no means was back to it&#x27;s pre-color self.  Ultrax Labs specifically states that you need to be patient and use it at least 5 days a week to start.  After 2 weeks my hair is once again thick and back to normal.  I still use the shampoo once a week just to keep it healthy. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product. I am impressed with how well it works it also lathers up nicely and it smells fantastic and my hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and has a nice texture, so it’s a pleasure to wash one’s hair with it. There are reports in the medical literature that caffeine and ketoconazole have properties that cause them to help restore hair loss. Google “caffeine and hair loss”, “ketoconazole and hair loss”, and “caffeine and ketoconazole and hair loss”, and one will find reports on studies that discuss the actions of these agents in the treatment of hair loss. Ketoconazole is currently in shampoos to help control dandruff.  I plan to share it with my brother who has had thinning hair for years. I think he’ll like it and run out to buy his own bottle. I also have friends with thinning hair who are always complaining about the state of their locks. I’ll show them my bottle and discuss the product with them and encourage them to read the reviews on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product definitely lives up to its promise.  After the first couple of uses regular shedding was reduced dramatically and my hair definitely has more strength.  For the most optimal results, use for about 5 washes per week.  This shampoo forms a nice lather with a pleasing scent as well.  It is a great alternative to multi-step processes for stimulating hair growth.</li>
    <li> Though the smell is strong, I got used to it fast because I felt volumizing effects after just one use!</li>
    <li> Waiting for this to work.</li>
    <li> With so much stress in college I&#x27;ve noticed that I started losing my hair. First it would increasingly fall out in the shower and then I started noticing it all over my clothes. Decided to give this a shot as my friend recommended this product. Started using it and saw results very fast; the hair loss visibly decreased. Will be my shampoo for a while now!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s another product that Amazon sells, where you get a lot more for the same price.  That product works well for my husband. This is equally effective, but more expensive.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product three weeks ago, and I have already started to see results. I have been suffering from excessive shedding and hair loss for several years now, so I decided to finally take action and I purchased this problem. I’ve been using it regularly 4 or 5x per week as recommended, and starting almost two weeks in, I started to see a notable reduction in dandruff after my morning shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs on the top of my head have started growing in fuller, and I don’t seem to lose as many as I used to. It took a while for me to notice the change, but I can clearly see it working now, and I can’t wait for my friends and family to notice too. I have around ¼ of a bottle left, and I will be buying it again before this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo.  Lathers just fine.  Appears to bring results fast.  I have used five times, and within a week, I have already seen new growth.  To be fair, I also take a Biotin supplement and I use Hair Lush as well.  I will continue to use these products to return my hair to it&#x27;s natural, full, and healthy state.</li>
    <li> My husband decided to give this a try as his hair is thinning.  He commented on how he likes how the shampoo feels when he washes his hair and his stylist asked what he was using as well.  I am not losing hair but have thin hair that can tangle easily.  I decided to try this product and find my hair feels thicker and is easier to manage.  I also love the smell of the shampoo.  Overall,.. a great product!</li>
    <li> this is the last time i stopped trusting &#x27;hair regrow shampoos&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;esp one with too many good ratings.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. If you want to look like you have more hair, get a thickening shampoo, tts your best bet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything over the counter, and nothing seemed to regrow any hair.  I bought this shampoo (very skeptical).  This product is a GODSEND!  Not only does it smell great, it gives you that deep down clean feeling. After only one usage, my hair had way more body and volume than before washing it. After only one week I noticed new hair growth where I needed it!  My ponytail is much thicker than before and I&#x27;m also losing much less hair when I brush after showering.  A month after starting to use this, I have seen so much new hair growth I&#x27;m thrilled beyond words.  Totally worth every penny!  Thank you thank you thank you!</li>
    <li> Product works great! Makes my hair fuller, doesn&#x27;t strip my hair down to the bare, lathers great and easy to rinse. I will definitely continue to use this shampoo and refer it to a friend. My girlfriend loves it too!</li>
    <li> I like it..use it with the hair vitamins as well...it dries your hair out so make sure ya use a great conditioner.  Doesn&#x27;t lather much.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I have lost faith in all hair loss/hair growth products UNTIL I tried the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo - with this product my faith in hair loss/hair growth products has been restored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been in the process of losing my hair since my early twenties, due to the daily abuse that I put it through, from chemically treating it to regularly straightening it to even gluing hair extensions in my hair and losing an enormous amount of hair when I took them out. However, the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back with my hair loss was my pregnancy - after having a child I couldn&#x27;t even wear my hair down because running my fingers through my hair would cause me to lose about 15 hairs every time. I would be mortified when I had to wash my hair because the amount of hair that was in the tub was probably enough to make a wig out of it. My hair was literally shedding EVERYWHERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past few years I have tried probably every product there is out there to help with my hair thinning problem. From vitamins/supplements to hair loss kits to hair masks to other hair loss shampoos, I even went as far as changing my diet around to help prevent hair loss and NOTHING helped until I laid my hands on the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 2 weeks now and I already notice a difference! Ever since I began using this shampoo my hair feels thicker and fuller. In addition, this shampoo has accelerated my hair growth... I can see baby hairs beginning to grow around my hairline. Furthermore, when I go shower now or brush my hair I notice a considerably less amount of hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few other reasons why I love this shampoo over anything else I have tried. First, working full-time and being a parent, time is of the essence to me so I needed something thats quick. Using this shampoo I only have to leave theshampoo on for 5 minutes which is totally doable with my schedule and the ease of application is very simple. Second, the other products that I used leave my hair feeling oily and dirty but not this shampoo...after using this shampoo my hair doesn&#x27;t feel oily, it leaves my hair feeling clean, healthy and silky smooth. Third, the other products that I used had an awful/unbearable smell but not this shampoo - this shampoo has a pleasant smell and not overly fragrant. Lastly, the price of this shampoo is comparable, if not cheaper, than the other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product and I don&#x27;t even have 1 bad thing to say about it. This product helped me save my hair and I will continue using it and recommending it to others!</li>
    <li> Ok, I feel like I have to share this... I tried the Ultrax shampoo because I noticed that I&#x27;ve been shedding A LOT lately and I haven&#x27;t noticed as many baby hairs growing back. So I thought I would incorporate a shampoo that would stimulate hair growth into my routine. I&#x27;m not going to lie, the product is not cheap, but honestly I was open to trying it since the other options that I&#x27;ve tried have not worked. During my first go with Ultrax I noticed that the shampoo smelled pretty pleasant, it had good foaming power and I really like that they use natural ingredients. My hair felt very clean and I noticed that had a little more body and shine after the first wash.  As a side note I wash my hair almost every day…I know some of you are gasping, but I work out almost every day and I can&#x27;t shower and not wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for almost a week now and I have noticed some POSITIVE RESULTS which is pretty exciting!! My hair seems to have more volume and is really shiny, BUT I have also noticed that the shedding has decreased and I swear that I am seeing more baby hairs growing in!!! It must be something in the caffeinated compound blended with essential oils that honestly stimulates the hair follicle growth. I don&#x27;t know…but at this point I&#x27;m SUPER excited to see the results in the following weeks because it looks pretty good so far! :)</li>
    <li> I have always had thin hair and as I got older it has gotten thinner. I have used other hair thickening products in the past and have never been satisfied. But this product actually made my hair thicker. For me, it&#x27;s worth the price. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This concentrated shampoo smells nice and it contains caffeinated compounds blended with essential oil. It helps to stimulate hair follicle growth. I noticed positive results after using it just twice. My hair has more volume and it is shiny. You do not have to worry about negative side effects and the product comes with a money-back guarantee.</li>
    <li> After the recommended uses per week for about three weeks, I have begun to notice that my hair is more sturdier. Before, when I ran across my hand through my hair, I would detect some hairs on my hand. The product has helped me see less of this. My hair feels stronger and thicker, which is a greet feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels good on the scalp and lathering is not an issue. As a shampoo, the product also does it&#x27;s work as it lathers nicely and leaves your hair silky. Definitely will continue using. Good results so far.</li>
    <li> I noticed an initial change in hair loss that eventually tapered out. I won&#x27;t be re-upping.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works amazing! I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now (5 times a week as directed on the bottle.) I love the tingly and refreshing sensation it leaves my scalp after the lather. The scent of the shampoo is very pleasant and not strong. I felt the difference from the first day of use and kept noticing more ever since.  My hair feels thicker, fuller, and stronger than 3 weeks ago. I used to be able to easily comb out handful of hairs with just my fingers, but after just two weeks I can actually comb my hair with barely leaving strands. I can feel the change of weight of my hair because it has grown more and I shed way less. My hair used to be flimsy and flat but now has a strong thick texture to it. It&#x27;s also more manageable and less frizzy than ever. Seriously, you notice differences!  Will continue using. This product is well worth it!</li>
    <li> Well, honestly I was skeptical at first. I ordered it primarily for my husband who is balding in the front but I used it couple times myself too. After just 2 times I can see the results – my hair is thicker and not shedding at all! It works perfectly for my sensitive scalp (I had hard times finding anything that won’t irritate my skin.) My husband is very satisfied so far. After 5 uses his baby hairs have started growing again!</li>
    <li> Doubtful would define my feelings towards anything that says it will grow hair.  I have a full head of hair with a small crowning spot on the back of my head that my girlfriend points to every now and then.  So I tried this shampoo for a week.  I never thought I would be admitting this, but if there is not new hair, the hair that is already there is thicker and the little crown is all by gone.  Also, the shampoo is really nice and smells like a minty spa.</li>
    <li> luv this product !!! Will buy another very soon !!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Not only has this shampoo brought life and shine back to my hair, but it also smells really good too. You can actually feel it working. If you are having hair growth issues, this shampoo is a must have.</li>
    <li> 24 years old, healthy female who is having hair loss due to hormonal imbalances.  Got my thyroid checked, iron, etc..all normal. This has done absolutely NOTHING!! Shedding has remained as bad as it was before I used this. Given that it&#x27;s not cheap, I consider it a total rip-off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it less than two weeks but already I appear to have less shedding.  I only shampoo every 2 to 3 days so I&#x27;m please so far with how this is panning out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shedding has been an issue for the past 4 years.  Nothing has stopped it.  I will update in the next few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 3 and still have less shedding.  For the sake of being completely open I also added in Dr Hauscken Neem oil a week ago and I LOVE that organic natural hair tonic.  I&#x27;ve had less shedding in the last three weeks than I&#x27;ve had in the last four years.  Before this I was shedding 70 in my morning comb out (I belong to a long hair community board and we do crazy things like count our shed) then every time I combed my hair it was along 10 to 15 hairs.  I must have been losing 150 a day easy.  I&#x27;m down to 30 in the morning comb out and I&#x27;m over the moon.  Not sure this is pan out as a successful hair experiment but willing to give one bottle a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I only shampoo every 2 to 3 days so I&#x27;m not following their directions of 5 x a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this product.  I have very fine light hair and due to my age, it&#x27;s thinning. After the first use my hair was noticeably thicker. It has a refreshing sensation and I could feel it stimulating my scalp.  After a week of using it, my hair has body and isn&#x27;t limp.  My hair is colored and I found it to be safe and not alter the color of my hair.  You may need to use a little more than average to work up a lather but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t worked at all. I used it with the conditioner for hair thinning issues. Saw no change at all.</li>
    <li> Does nothing , not even a good shampoo. Any volumizer shampoo does better for way less. Total waste of money</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells really great and it also works! My hair is the thickest it has ever been. My hair is fine and this shampoo makes it really thick and beautiful. It is also safe and revitalizing so it can be used five times a week without drying out the scalp or hair. It is mouisturizing and thickening at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for hair loss. This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve personally tried at least three of their products for over 8 months and none of them worked at all. In some cases they made the problem worse! This one in particular causes your hair to fall out what appears to be three times as fast. When I stopped using it my hair stopped falling out as fast. Go with minoxidil instead. It&#x27;s actually scientifically proven to work and FDA approved, unlike this snake oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also seen ads on Craigslist for paid reviews for this product, and the seller sends emails soliciting reviews for bribes.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time on hair care and buy high quality hair care products. Hair Surge is the latest addition to my regimen and I&#x27;m thrilled with the product. I like that it&#x27;s a shampoo I can use daily. It lathers up nicely and has a pleasant aroma. Aesthetically, it leaves my hair silky and shiny, with lots of body. With this shampoo, there is minimal hair shedding and growth of new hair. If you want a great shampoo that is effective at cleaning and keeping your hair healthy, this is your new best hair friend.</li>
    <li> First of all, I really like my Ultra Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and I have truly noticed fuller hair and less shedding. My friends have even commented on the improved appearance of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually pick up the shampoo that is on sale at the drug store but I figured if I was going to solve my hair loss problem I would have to actually try to do something about it. My research led me to Ultra Labs. Their 100% money back guarantee gave me the added nudge to get off the fence and try to get my hair in line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The investment has been worth it. The shampoo has a nice lather. It smells good. I think it is important to note it has to stay on for at least two minutes to be effective. It’s like a conditioner. It has charge up my hair and gotten it growing again. I highly recommend my Ultra Labs shampoo.</li>
    <li> Wow!! This shampoo more than surpassed my expectations. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and have already noticed an improvement in the amount of hair I&#x27;m shedding, and my hair feels thicker than ever also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells good, feels nice, and doesn&#x27;t actually take a whole lot to coat your hair. I&#x27;ve been mixing it with my conditioner and washing my hair every other day so far, and it&#x27;s been working wonderfully! Can&#x27;t wait to see what it&#x27;s done after a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it on the regular but it didn&#x27;t make my scalp feel any sort of way. It also did not do a very good job of washing my hair. I stick with organix biotin collection or the french collection for hair loss from Sephora.</li>
    <li> The product too hard to lather.</li>
    <li> Due to stress i was experiencing hair loss. Ultrax labs hair surge really helped. Made my scalp feel rejuvenated. and the results were amazing. thicker hair and no bald spots.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am a college student who started to unfortunately realize an early receding hairline and this shampoo has been working great for me! Unlike most hair growth shampoos, which can be daunting due to the process involved and their ingredients, Ultrax was an easy-to-manage alternative.  Definitely a must buy for anyone looking to make their hair more full!</li>
    <li> I have used several similar products, and this is by far the best.    No bad smell like other products I&#x27;ve used.    My hair is thicker, and I am very happy with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the Best!!! I loved it couldn&#x27;t wait to get this and use it.  It works!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is horrible. I had sores all over my head after using it for about 2 weeks. When I stopped using it, they went away real quick. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to something in it but it was a very bad experience</li>
    <li> Skeptical as with all this stuff but I have noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not bald so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the magic cure to regrow hair.  I&#x27;m in the maintaining what I have stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Rogaine foam for a couple years and trying different shampoos to work with the Rogaine.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve found so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really lather much so you have to use a pretty good amount each time of you still have hair.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and I started seeing improvement in hair growth and thickness, I recommend this product to everyone with hair loss. It truly does work you just have to be patient!</li>
    <li> So far so good. Not sure it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product smells absolutely amazing and is definitly worth the money! It brought my hair back to life after I bleeched it and ruined it, and was so sad that the parts that fell out wouldn&#x27;t grow in fast enough. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! It made my hair feel thick &amp; clean even after the first use. I love that it contains both caffeine and ketoconazole- ingredients both known for stimulating hair growth.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair out. Need to use quite a bit to get a good lather.</li>
    <li> I am very excited to use this shampoo. My hair hasn&#x27;t really been growing so I think this shampoo will really benefit me.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from hair loss, receding hairlines, thinning hair, then look no further than ultrax. I have dealt with an embarrassing receding hairline at a young age, but once I was given the recommendation of ultrax, I honestly could not be happier. Only after a couple of weeks of applying the shampoo, my hair grew baby hairs right where my hair was receding, it&#x27;s a little awkward because of the different lengths but once it grew out, it looked just how I wanted it to. Not only does the shampoo do what it was made for, overall it&#x27;s a great general shampoo that smells great and has a nice lather, the shampoo also lasts a long time considering you only need to do a couple pumps. I am telling you right now it&#x27;s worth every dollar if you care about your appearance and suffer from the things I listed above. Excellent product, 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Hair Surge shampoo by Ultrax Labs is one of the best and  effective product to treat hair loss.It uses caffeine to stimulate your hair follicles and improve the texture and health of your hair. It also contains Ketoconazole, which is an anti-inflammatory molecule that has been shown to help prevent hair loss. Lastly, it contains saw palmetto, which is thought to block one of the biochemical pathways that lead to hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This shampoo should be used 5 times per week, and left in the hair for 5 minutes each time for best results, and you will notice a difference within two weeks,It smells and feels like a normal shampoo, comes in a container which makes dispensing easy and straightforward. You won’t use more shampoo than you need to,and can be used both by men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this shampoo from Beauty superstore plus and was amazed how fast was the delivery,I received the package in my home in less than 2 days.Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Went from bald to think hair in one wash!  I&#x27;ll be buying palates of this shampoo!  Well worth the $50 bones.  Here&#x27;s to thick hair!</li>
    <li> The first few times you use this shampoo it was amazing. My hair did feel thicker. However, over time this shampoo is very hard on your hair. My hair became very brittle and dry and started falling out. To be quite honest my hair started looking worse after using Ultrax. I think this shampoo just gives you the illusion that its actually working-- by making your hair feel fuller/thicker. But in reality, its really not doing anything. I used about half the bottle and threw it in the trash when my hair started feeling like straw. I&#x27;m switching to bosley since they have more to offer.</li>
    <li> I have been using it everyday for 5 days as per the instructions and leaving it on for two minutes. I have been suffering from thinning hair, after I wash my hair the shower always had hair everywhere and hair on my pillow case in the morning. When washing my hair I lather up and I like the tingling feeling it gives my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t smell like normal shampoo but I don&#x27;t mind the smell. I have not been leaving hair  (shedding) in the shower since I started using it. My hair feels fuller when I brush it and I have had compliments the last few days about how shiny my hair is which makes me feel good. I am finding less breakage when I brush it. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after one month.</li>
    <li> Has a nice light smell and left my hair super clean and shiny.  Not a lot of lather, but my hair was left cleaner and had more body than it does with my usual store-bought brand.</li>
    <li> Two uses and I already notice my hair feels thicker, stronger and isn&#x27;t falling out when I brush it!  It leaves your hair shiny and manageable and smells so fresh and clean. It&#x27;s unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> Upon using this shampoo, I noticed an immediate difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I noticed that the amount of hairs I was losing was decreasing on a daily basis.  When I shower, I noticed the amount of hairs in the shower drain were decreased significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I have noticed that my hairline receded by a noticeable amount.  There is also a bald patch that was forming on the top of my head.  After a few weeks using this shampoo, the bald patch was filling up with hair!  My hairline has also gone back to its original state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, not only have I regrown hair, the hair itself is very thick and healthy.  My girlfriend has noticed the difference, she wants to use my shampoo now.</li>
    <li> I am 22 male and was using hair and shoulders 2 times a day and started thinning. I stopped using it completely and using this now once a day. My hair is showing signs of thickening after two months.very pleased and worth the price</li>
    <li> I have been concerned about my receding hair line and my forehead growing &amp;#34;larger.&amp;#34; I look at my father&#x27;s wedding pictures and he and all his brothers were bald in their wedding photos. My mother had thick hair and I have retained that from her. After trying Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Growth Stimulating Shampoo in less than 2 weeks I had new (or seemed to be baby hair) growing back in the region that had receded off my forehead! I was amazed and a good friend even noticed it and asked what I was doing differently! It makes me look younger which in turn makes me feel younger and as far as I am concerned the price is worth it considering what other people pay to look young and the methods used in doing so. It&#x27;s a worthy product to try and Amazon has a great return policy if you are skeptical about the price. You have nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> This caffeine shampoo lathers like foam, and smells fantastic. Roots on my scalp felt much thicker after drying. Highly recommend this product for people who needs hair repair and root revival or just to feed some nutrients into tired hair follicles. I have thick hair, but the ends are extremely dry from over dying, after shampooing feels more nourished and healthier. With few more rinses with this product, although it is on the higher end of price range and a small amount, it is definitely worth buying for a special treatment every once in awhile.</li>
    <li> Product is amazing!  Noticed instant results in the first use!  Shipping was amazing also...received withig 3 days and in great condition... if this is what your looking for then look no further!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great! Smells great! It gives my scalp a tingly mint feeling. Would def. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a little over a week, but I am liking it so far. I naturally have thick, course hair, but I also have a receding hairline and baldness running in my family. In the time that I have been using this shampoo, I can say that, so far, it feels as if my hair is getting stronger. I am not necessarily seeing hair sprouting or anything, but I never feel as if I need to be using another conditioner or hair product. I shampoo my hair first thing and leave it in my hair as I attend to the rest of my body. I rinse out the shampoo very last. It rinses out cleanly (i.e. doesn&#x27;t feel like some kind of residue is in my hair), and my hair feels as if it has been conditioned as well (i.e. feels a little less course, softer). The product description says that it helps with scalp vitality, and I think that might be behind the feeling of &amp;#34;stronger hair&amp;#34; when I get out of the shower. My hair and head don&#x27;t feel as if running my hand, a comb, or brush through my hair will result in a lot of hair being pulled out as a result. The conditioning aspect of the shampoo helps ease the high price tag, since I don&#x27;t feel the need to get additional conditioner. But, it still is pricey.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge is a highly successful shampoo. After a short period of time there were tremendous results! Deeper thickness to hair- Good bye thinning! Less hair loss!! Stronger Healthier Hair! No itching or burning. I recommend this for the person wanting to maintain and/or improve current hair condition- depending on your current hair treatments. It&#x27;s worth trying!</li>
    <li> The bottle is 8 oz.  The shampoo is thick and concentrated.  I recommend using a lighter shampoo before applying the Hair Surge to the scalp, otherwise it takes a bit to lather.  I have noticed that I am shedding less hair after a week using it.  The scent is not strong, slightly citrus.  Wish I had gotten the conditioner too.</li>
    <li> Hair Surge shampoo comes in an 11.2-ounce bottle, not much smaller than the standard 12.5-ounce container used for many hair cleansing products.  Like many quality shampoos, Hair Surge has a thick, silky consistency and fresh, clean scent that is not overpowering. The shampoo glides on the hair strands during application. It rinses off with ease, leaving the hair feeling soft and conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Ultrax Labs’ shampoo, which is relatively new to the market, is designed for men and women coping with hair thinning and loss. Though it cost more than the basic, non-specialized hair cleansers, its price fits within the average range for similar hair-loss shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Surge contains ingredients beneficial to growing and maintaining healthy hair. Those are essential oils -- important for conditioning and moisturizing hair -- and caffeine compounds known to stimulate hair follicles so hair grows faster and to extend the hair lifecycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ketoconazole and Saw Palmetto are two other important components in this shampoo.  Ketoconazole is an anti-fungal commonly used to treat dandruff, but that also stunts hair loss by blocking testosterone. Saw Palmetto, which has a long history in herbal medicine, increases hair density.&lt;br /&gt;It requires time, consistent usage and patience to see results, especially when using products designed to reverse long-term effects. But the ingredients, along with Ultrax Labs’ 100% satisfaction guarantee, make this shampoo a winner worth trying.</li>
    <li> Not sure about the results, but the shampoo is good for shampooing .. I use it almost everyday in the gym</li>
    <li> This product really does help hair growth. The product works immediately after the first use. Great Product that I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was totally impressed at how fast acting this is. It made my hair thicker and fuller in less than a month. It&#x27;s inexpensive, smells great and works up quite a lather. It lives up to it&#x27;s claims for sure. The bottle lasts about a month if used as directed so you really do get a lot for your buck. Great product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does&#x27;t do what it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;After starting using this shampoo my hairs are falling even more.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get my money back. Not sure whether seller reads reviews.</li>
    <li> I am so glad someone told me about this shampoo!  My hair is thicker and healthier than it&#x27;s been in years!  Loving Ultrax.</li>
    <li> I have used this item for about two weeks now and I can clearly say that I do not shed as much!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true! I was skeptical on this item because some of these reviews seemed too good to be true...&lt;br /&gt;I thought shampoos were not that effective in hair health since it gets washed off in matter of minutes, but that was not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Pros]&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells amazing; citrus-y, herbal.... it is a clean and fresh scent that is not too strong, so it would be good for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;2. It cleans your hair without stripping it! It actually does not lather much, so I was worried because I have tried many shampoos that don&#x27;t lather and a handful of them did not &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my hair as I would have liked it to... leaving hair feeling a bit greasy even after the shampoo. however, this one does not! It doesn&#x27;t later, and it washes off easily, but it makes my hair feel so bouncy and clean. I was really surprised on this fact.&lt;br /&gt;3. The Most important part of all... I don&#x27;t shed as much. I usually have a problem with shedding because I don&#x27;t have a TOO much hair to begin with and my hair is very fine, so whenever I shampoo, I always have a bulk of hair that comes out that worries me... I don&#x27;t even know, but it usually looks like a ball of hair after my shower (sorry, TMI). After I have used this shampoo, I have noticed a SIGNIFICANT difference in my shedding. I only shed a couple of strands, I&#x27;m not even joking. Sometimes, some hair comes out because it gets pulled out, etc., but even when I brush my hair after shower... the shedding has drastically improved. This item gets A+ just on this point alone.&lt;br /&gt;4. Although I do think that my hair is growing a little faster than normal, I cannot tell too much whether it actually grew a lot because of this shampoo. But when I straighten my hair, I can see that my hair has gotten longer since the day I started using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Cons]&lt;br /&gt;1. Aside from this heavy price tag, I find no cons on this product. But honestly, this shampoo is so WORTH the amount because it is really good.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! You can feel it like a slight tingle on the scalp. I love the scent and my hair feels stronger and thicker. It&#x27;s not too bubbly and it rinses out well. I even have my mother using it now. It has made a big difference!</li>
    <li> Have been using for over 2 months now, haven&#x27;t seen any effect so far.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has no lather at all, so I have to wash my hair with another shampoo first (adding to the high cost).  Also, it is extremely drying to my hair.  I have to stop using it, so I&#x27;ll never find out whether it actually works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for months now and i love it! The minute i ran out and i had to use a different shampoo for a day or two i could tell a difference, my hair felt and looked thinner and weaker and was also falling out. 100% worth the price</li>
    <li> I have tried other products like this and really didn&#x27;t believe it could work as well as they say.  Let me tell you, this is the one!  Folks with hair loss and hair growth issues should really know about this and give it a try.  It is definitely very effective, and better than any others out there.  I have even tried supplements for hair growth, and nothing compares with this shampoo.  You have to see it to believe it!</li>
    <li> Started having significant hair loss &amp; deterioation of my nails. Went on for about a year. Spoke with physicians.They brushed me off with &#x27;You&#x27;re aging. Comes w getting older &amp; hormone changes.&#x27; Always had a head full of curly natural wavy hair. More the changes went on the more concerned I became. Something was wrong &amp; I knew it. Ordered Hair Surge. Started using it. It took time &amp; I kept having hair loss but started noticing gradually the loss was decreasing. Went for mammogram &amp; was disgnosed with breast cancer. Had partial mastectomy. Surgery went well. No history of breast cancer or any cancer on either side of my family. Shocker!! Kept using Hair Surge. Hair loss subsided with what I consider normal loss now. August 26th I will be a two year breast cancer survivor. My hair is right where I want it to be. I didn&#x27;t undergo chemo. Am taking anti-hormone meds. Persistance is key with using this product.Love how it makes my hair shine &amp; feel. FYI I like lather so wash first with salon type shampoo then use Hair Surge. It does the job even with another product used first. Love Hair Surge. Really helped that I had already been using it before my surgery. I did notice new hair growth along my hairline in front first. Was so excited to see that. I knew then the product was working.</li>
    <li> The shampoo definitely does a lot to strengthen and fortify my hair as well as prevent my girlfriend and my shower drain from clogging up with our hair. I was skeptical about caffeine used on the skin topically but I am now a fan! I really feel like it is worth the money. Before you would have called me crazy to spend 50$ on shampoo but not any more!! After this Hair Surge I feel like I have a chance to push my full headed hair into the 30&#x27;s! What is that worth to you??! Mind you this does not happen overnight you got to give it a week at least once per day and make sure to leave in the hair at least 5 minutes before rinsing for maximum results!!</li>
    <li> I have long silky hair. Recently, I began to notice that my hair started falling out, more and more hair left on the comb, on the bathroom floor, on the clothes, in the bathtub, everywhere I go! I was desperate!&lt;br /&gt;I was just lucky enough to try Hair Surge Shampoo before I spent hundreds of dollars on other products that may be ineffective. I am so happy with my purchase. After just a week of everyday application I already can see that my hair became stronger, hair loss decreased significantly, there is less hair on a comb, which means that more hair left on my head after brushing. Too early to talk about the growth of new hair, but I can confidently assert that the use of this shampoo significantly reduced hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks strong, silky and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo smells good, it is economical, just two clicks on the dosing head is enough for me, even though the fact that I have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;A great remedy for those who lose their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll keep you guys updated on my progress.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair so I decided to try a new shampoo. The smell of this shampoo is delicious. I didn&#x27;t want to stop smelling my hair after my shower. It thoroughly cleansed my hair and is helping me work towards thicker luxurious hair. Def recommend this shampoo for thinning hair that will help with growth and make you smell like a citrus spring day</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to see a difference.  I will continue and see if it works.</li>
    <li> Goodbye bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t believe a shampoo would actually help hair grow back but slowly but surely the bald spot on the back of my head is becoming less visible due to new hair growth. I&#x27;ve been using the product 2-3 times a week for two months.  I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; very thick but frizzy hair.  I got a Keratin treatment through Groupon.  You get what you pay for!  As much as I love my straighter hair, it got a lot thinner and drier, and I was noticing my scalp where I part my hair.  My worst concern proved true when my closest girlfriend told me that I had a bald spot in back.  I freaked out and bought this shampoo, recommended by another friend. I splurged for the conditioner and serum too.  Pricey, but a lot cheaper than hair replacement!  My hair feels softer, there&#x27;s less hair loss when I brush it, and some wispy hairs are growing in for thicker bangs!  It really works, It&#x27;s not instantaneous but keep using it, you&#x27;ll see a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product! Was very surprised but I started seeing results after a few days. Scent is sort of botanical, not overwhelming. Would definitely recommend to those with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> After looking for something to help with my thinning hair I decided to take a chance on this. I’ve now been using this product for well over 3 months, and am writing this review after my second purchase, I have noticed a considerable difference in the thickness of my hair. I’ve also found that my hair does not shed as much as it used to. I expect that this will continue with more and more use and I will definitely continue to purchase this fantastic shampoo for a third, fourth, and fifth time. You don’t need more than two pumps; it smells great and does its job. It may be a bit expensive but then again you get what you pay for, and what I got was the feeling of thicker, fuller hair which increased my confidence and is only going to get better. My scalp thanks you! Fantastic product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product regularly for the past month. I have little wisps of hair beginning to grow. Not sure if its the shampoo or the prayer I use before applying. Either way something is growing. Unfortunately they are gray hairs, but that&#x27;s another issue for another day.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because it has 2 ingredients that stop hair loss: Saw Palmetto and caffeine. When I started noticing the hair at my hairline was thinning, I did a lot of research on what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Saw Palmetto blocks an enzyme that can cause hair loss and caffeine works right at the hair root to speed up the rate of growth. Finding them both in one product was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather much, as others have mentioned. But that&#x27;s actually a good thing. Too much lather means there&#x27;s too much detergent in it, and detergent can strip essential oils from your hair and make it more prone to breaking. Don&#x27;t worry about the lack of lather...it gets your hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 3 weeks for me to notice results, but I kept with it and it was totally worth it. I have both new growth at my hairline and my hair&#x27;s condition overall is much better. I have less frizz and ragged looking ends. Bottom line: it works. You have to get used to the low lather and leaving it on your scalp for a while, but once you do, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> The results were great for me. I notice hair growth after just a couple of washes. My hair is overall healthier now that I am using the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Shampoo. Shedding has been an issue/concern in the past.  I notice  less shedding. This shampoo has increase hair regrowth and is bringing my hair back to the fullness it once had. It lathers up nicely and I do leave it on for the full 5 minutes to maximize the effects. I plan to continue to use this product. I am sold on the great effects it is having on my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is the truth there isn&#x27;t anything better out there that can compare to this product.You must try it and see for yourself.It will leave you feeling brand new and refreshed satisfaction guranteed.It smells so good and has very rich lather that will make you feel revitalized.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing! My hair is so much healthier. I used to lose so so so much hair and now using ultras it is just minimal shedding that I hardly notice. There is a visible difference in my hair quality too. It just looks thicker and shinier! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away! My hair felt thicker and healthier after the very first use. The shampoo has a more pleasant, lighter scent than other shampoos like this, and is easy to work through your roots. It also doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover your whole head so this bottle will last you a decent amount of time even with daily use. Follow the directions and you will definitely get results.</li>
    <li> This was purchased based on the recommendation of a good friend. I love the fact that&#x27;s a Unisex Product.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it made my hair fuller, smooth and slowed down hair shed from blow drying.  My husband who has the &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; man&lt;br /&gt;hair, swears by this. It seems to have made his hair fuller, with more body and much more confidence.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor that I ordered from was extremely prompt with their delivery.</li>
    <li> I really love this product!!  First off, the shampoo has a very mild peppermint fragrance, it doesn&#x27;t smell of harsh chemicals or overpowering mint or flowers.  Second, I normally shed tons of hairs when showering, brushing and throughout the day.  This really helped; it&#x27;s down to very little shedding all day long.  Third, I don&#x27;t have thick hair, it&#x27;s mostly fine, straight/bordering on frizzy.  After about a week of using Ultrax, I noticed more hair starting to grow!  And the the frizziness has been tamed a bit.  A nice bonus.  After the second week, I saw that the rest of my hair grew out a bit more than normal.  I&#x27;m going to have to order some more very soon!!!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say I was a skeptic Initially, after I had tried products like Mane And Tail, organic shampoos, and even  Wen formulated by the makers of proactiv. But I remember my ideals that cause you&#x27;ve tried a few doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ve tried them all.I have been  using this product that came highly recommended by a  good friend of mine.  After having my second baby I noticed less shedding by using this shampoo. My hair is fuller and healthier. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is a very useful product that started to work immediately. I share it with my mother and we both see hair growth, The only down side is the price and also it does notl  lather well. It leaves a great scent and I will definitely reorder,</li>
    <li> As a person who started experiencing some minor bolding, I enjoy this shampoo for several reasons. First, it gives me full and thick hair that make it hard for others to notice bolding. Second, hair is more manageable than it used to be before. In addition, my dry scalp problems associated with dandruff seem to be improving. I really enjoy using it almost everyday!</li>
    <li> Very bad shampoo my hair become falls down More and more since I used this shampoo very bad very bad</li>
    <li> Ok, so this was a bit pricey to what I normally pay for regular shampoo, however it was worth every penny spent, being its not just regular shampoo.  I have has two bald spots in my head for over 10 years now. Nothing I have tried in the past seems to work. Within a couple of weeks of using this shampoo,  I saw huge improvements in my hair and scalp. My scalp used to be ashy and my hair was a bit flaky and somewhat brittle. After using the shampoo, my hair is growing thicker and fuller now. Its even softer to the touch. My scalp is healthy with no itching even after I am done exercising. That used to be a problem for me, but I no longer have this problem since using this shampoo. I am very happy with the results and recommend it 110%. I give this shampoo 6 stars!!! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been one week and I&#x27;m impressed. I notice less hair on the bathroom floor after my morning styling sessions. My scalp feels much less irritated and my hair feels stronger. It&#x27;s too soon to comment on the speed of my hair growth, but less shedding and breakage is reason enough for me to be thrilled. I notice it lathers much better if I thoroughly wet my hair and scalp before applying the shampoo. The scent is fresh and it leaves my fine curly hair feeling super clean. I will re-purchase when I&#x27;ve finished this bottle. Happy hair growing!</li>
    <li> My hair tends to shed and thin during the fall and winter months, which is a huge hassle and makes me rather self-conscious. After watching my balding&#x27;s hair sprout back in with this product, I just had to try it on my own! After the first week, I noticed a decrease in shedding, and after two weeks, my hair was coming back in beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little afraid when I started that it would dry my hair out or make it frizzy, but it didn&#x27;t! My hair still feels silky soft. In fact, I think it feels better with this shampoo than with most store-bought versions. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s absolutely worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 42 year old healthy female and at this age and the health level that I&#x27;m at, I would not expect hair loss issues. Working out and eating right just was not enough. Desperately I have searched for the best hair growth shampoo. I tried some that have a famous name (you know it!) but it did not work.  That brand did not work for my husband either.  Frustrating!  I decided to give Ultrax a try. My hair is important to me!  It says to use at least 5 days a week, but I use it daily. I have seen great results!  I get out of the shower, put my hand on my forehead and run my hand back through my hair and see new baby hairs! I showed my husband and he started using it too.  So now those baby hairs will just grow!  Shedding has also slowed down and that is noticeable.  The scent is good (unlike some of these type shampoos).  I plan to continue using it even after I am good with my hair just to keep it going.  Pump bottle is convenient, that is a plus because I hate wrestling with bottle tops in the morning!</li>
    <li> Have used the product for several days and haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions.  I was a bit cautious due to content of 0.2% Ketoconazole.  I would recommend users Google that and read up on the contraindications if you are on any Rx meds...    I have seen some slight improvement in scalp condition, which is encouraging.  Will take some time before I expect to see any change in hair growth.  My hair is soft and has good body after use.    The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather as much as regular shampoos...the instructions don&#x27;t say to lather and rinse twice... but I did because that is my normal way of shampooing... and I didn&#x27;t get the lather I wanted until the 2nd time.  I left it on for the recommended 2 minutes on the 2nd lather... I wondered whether using a conditioner afterwards would affect the results... would have liked to have seen something in the instructions about those two issues.</li>
    <li> Thank you to the people who left the helpful reviews!  You saved me 100 bucks. I almost fell for this...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my hair was beginning to thin on the top of my head. The shampoo has a lemon/lime scent to it which gives my hair that fresh shower smell. The shampoo does not lather up as regular shampoos however it does leave your hair clean, thick and strong.  Product highly recommended :)  I have included a before and after photo of a 5 day use.</li>
    <li> What a great idea to add a stimulant to hair shampoo to promote  hair growth,.. This product  should work well for menopause women or women with problem of falling hair. I can see how  caffeine will stimulate the hair follicles and keep the hair shaft open. Thank you</li>
    <li> OMG I can feel the difference in the thickness on top of my head. Great product!!!!!</li>
    <li> The shampoo almost reminds me of wen.  it&#x27;s gentle on hair, doesn&#x27;t form too much foam and bubbles or have harsh chemicals that attack your hair.  you massage your scalp for 3-5 mins and rinse.  Afterwards it feels smooth and volumized.  My boyfriend who has a balding spot said it feels tinkly while lathering, but not bad at all.  We both like it, i use it once a week and he uses it 4-5 times a week.  You don&#x27;t need to use alot each time, just 2 pumps or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely stimulates hair growth and give your current hair more volume/strength.  If you don&#x27;t want to invest thousands of dollars with hair implants and other invasive procedures, you should try this!</li>
    <li> I love the slight, tingling sensation as it works in the shower. I leave my shampoo on for a little more than 2 minutes on the roots (more like 3-5) to get the best results. My hair is full and shiny with no residue or build up issues. I have less hair fall out, no more clumps of hair falling out when I brush or comb my hair! A good value as I have already seen the results.</li>
    <li> I am a young man and have already begun to notice my hair beginning to weaken and recede. I have tried several OTC products but none have proven far too useful after continued use for months at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently purchased this product, hoping that the other reviews were promising enough to see better results. I&#x27;ve only been using it for less than a week, and ALREADY I have begun to notice a difference. I was shocked to see much less loose hair shedding and hope a bit of regrowth will begin, especially in the front over time. I will gladly update this review down the road with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I&#x27;m happy to provide the 5-star so soon, and without a great success story is that I love this shampoo! Unlike many of the other products, when I use the UltraX shampoo, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m lathering my scalp with a chemical malestrom. No, this actually feels like normal shampoo and my hair feels clean without any supplemental products. It has a nice scent and again I have already begun to notice a difference in my hair quality!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product, preferably a shampoo containing KETOCONAZOLE in hopes of clearing up my Seborrhoeic Dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;I have been suffering with it for several years and have had mixed results using both over the counter and prescription remedies.&lt;br /&gt;I went on to do some online research of clinical tests on this shampoo&#x27;s key active ingredients.  I learned that CAFFEINE extends the life cycle of hair follicles and that SAW PALMETTO blocks an enzyme considered to be a major cause of both male and female pattern baldness.  To my surprise, I also discovered that the anti-inflammatory active ingredient I was in search of - prescription strength KETOCONAZOLE also had a powerful side-effect that is found to be beneficial to people with thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;The combination of all of the above ingredients is quite miraculous as it seemed to have cleared up my scalp from the scaling and itching within 2 days. I know results can vary with individuals, but so far I am hugely impressed. Although it is said to be good practice to change products every few months (new info I also learned from my research) I will, until then, simply enjoy my (FINALLY!) clear and non-itchy scalp PLUS the bonus of stronger hair and a thicker, fuller head of it at that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not totally balding yet, but I was looking for something to pre-empt the inevitable.  I noticed that in just two weeks my hairline already appeared a little healthier.  I had been looking for something that I could use every day, but also would work to protect myself from hairloss.  I&#x27;m really happy with this product so far, let&#x27;s hope it keeps working!</li>
    <li> I just started using Hair Surge Shampoo and really like it so far. It removed buildup and doesn’t leave a residue. It also cleared up some minor itching I was experiencing.  Though it’s too soon to tell if new hair is growing in, I have already noticed a reduction in the amount of hair in the drain catch after a shower.  And there are fewer hairs in my hairbrush after brushing.  I like that Ultrax Labs stands behind their products with guarantee of 110% refund!</li>
    <li> This shampoo lifted my hair at the roots and provided volume and thickness all over. It also made my hair smell clean and fresh. If you want your hair to look like a lustrous mane, this is the perfect shampoo for you. Super fast shipment from Beauty Superstore Plus!</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair feel greasy not to mention I lost more hair while using it. I threw it out after one week. The caffeine listed on the bottle  isn&#x27;t the first, second or even third ingredient.  They have to list in order of ingredient amount.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. And it&#x27;s a lot for this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I have had an iron deficiency for years, and I’m always dealing with hair loss. I was feeling hopeless the products that I tried before caused me itch and gave me a stinging- sensation, but I am so surprised that  Hair Surge actually worked on! I am so excited to tell this to people who are experencing hair loss. After a few weeks, I saw my hair starting to grow back ! If you have a hair loss problem like me, this is what you need, as soon as I used I felt it stimulating my scalp, I feel you need to massage it into your scalp and wait a few munites. The result is fast and great, its surely worth the money. </li>
    <li> So far so great! After my first use, my hair felt thicker and healthier. Although expensive, I would definitely recommend this product because it is so much easier to use than other 12 step processes to improve your hair! It smells great, which is an added bonus and makes the difference between a 4 and 5 star review. No complaints here--this shampoo is everything I hoped it would be!</li>
    <li> Does not work, at all.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is very good for the hair. It has a great scent and cleans up very well. My wife just tried some of it and she loves it she says she could see a difference in how her hair looked much stronger and more shine</li>
    <li> i just received my product today and i can honestly say that this product is something i look forward to using. i&#x27;m glad that this product will help me with my hair loss problem. i highly recommend this product to anyone who needs it.</li>
    <li> Wow! So far I have been most impressed by this wonderful smelling shampoo after having washed my hair with it for more than the recommended five days in a row.  I&#x27;d been a bit anxious since I&#x27;ve been losing hair - more each time I shampoo -  so I was looking forward to trying this brand.  What I noticed from the beginning is the gentle tingling I feel on my scalp that continues for a while after each use.... this makes me optimistic about continuing usage - and also finally today there was less hair loss in my comb.  Secondly I have noticed that the texture of my hair is a bit different, thicker… the natural curl is looser (which I like) and my hair is shinier than before. I will purchase it again and also the conditioner to complete the package.</li>
    <li> I am more than happy with this shampoo, works like a charm!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for not only growing your hair, but also moisterizing. I was a little skeptical to use this shampoo because usually shampoos dry out my hair and cause more damage then good, but after reading the other reviews and was pleasantly surprised by the results. It took awhile before I started seeing results by after a couple of weeks I definitely have noticed a difference in texture and hair lenghth. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for quick results.</li>
    <li> I have been bleaching my hair for years which causes alot of shedding. This product has dramatically improved this problem. I also like the smell.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite shampoo.  I&#x27;ve struggled for years with hair loss and finally something that works.  Who would have thought that Caffeine was the answer.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive. It is a small bottle for $40+ dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I have not seen this product work as stated. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I brought this product for my father as an attempt to repair his rapid hair loss; hair balls the size of a child&#x27;s palm were everywhere in the bathtub. The texture of this product is silky, gentle, and light-weight. Compared to other products, there was no chemical scent present, though, there was a stimulating floral type of scent. The light-weight texture allows an effortless rinse, however, one might need to put in a bit more effort into lathering the product on the scalp. I always try a product before allowing my dad to use it to make use everything is safe. Speed up two and a half weeks after the initial treatment, tiny growing follicles of hair were were present in previous balding spots. I noticed that the texture and appearances of those baby hairs were in better health than the rest of the hairs; the color was darker and more apparent and the hair itself appears to be thicker and stronger than previously grown hairs. While this is only two and a half weeks into treatment, I am glad my dad is no longer turning bald! I will be  purchasing more of this product for my other balding uncles.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo as a recommendation from my barber as he said my hair was getting a little thin. He told me not to start using this as my regular shampoo but to use it once every 3 or 4 washings. I have been using this product for several months now and just picked up my second bottle. My hair is definitely looking and feeling thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - as a side note - I had a bit of dandruff which the shampoo helped to resolve. All in all I am very happy to have this product as I thought I might be getting bald at a young age ;)</li>
    <li> The Ultrax hair surge shampoo is great for people with receding hairlines and problems shedding, it gives you near instant results after a week of usage you&#x27;ll notice less shedding bald spots growing stubble and your hair becoming smoother and silkier the natural oils in it smell really good and don&#x27;t give you that nasty chemical feel that you find in most shampoos the product does exactly what it says it will not only does it stop the receding hairlines it stimulates growth in the scalp unlike its cheap counterparts the effects are long lasting and the results leave its user satisfied and ready to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Have used it for 6 months already as directed NO RESULTS .. Feels like i waisted my money on this</li>
    <li> I had been thinning for years and naturally assumed it would probably take some time to reverse. Wrong! WOW!! After using the product I&#x27;m sold! My hair is noticeably coming back!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely wakes you up in the morning! The caffeine is unmistakable in this product. My hair&#x27;s normally a bit light and straight, but this shampoo already has my hair feeling hydrated and a bit fuller.</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely helped my thinning hair! Much thicker and fuller now after a couple of weeks only.</li>
    <li> This product is something I found out about from a friend and has worked great for me since I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;ve been steadily having hair loss and this has really turned things around for me.  The process is really simple, which is a plus for me because I&#x27;m in a rush in the morning.  I&#x27;m just four months in and I&#x27;ve seen really good results.</li>
    <li> After just one use, my hair shines brighter and felt silkier than ever before! I have curly hair and this product really gave volume to my curls, there also was no greesy feeling afterwards. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to take their hair up to the next level.</li>
    <li> This product is great, My hair grew 1 inch in a month!!!! I was so surprised!! I used it on my daughter and her hair grew 1 1/2 inches and her hair is more healthy and so is mine. I recommend any one with hair loss or any hair damage to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product helped me stop my hair loss, not only that it also strengthened my hair and gave it life. The product&#x27;s effects began almost instantly, after 2 or 3 days of application you feel the results.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of this product and the texture as well! It arrived quickly and I have been using it on my thin hair every day since. So far my hair smells and feels fantastic, has a bit more volume, and feels healthier overall.</li>
    <li> I have used too many hair products but this one is very suitable to my hair.I got my hair silky and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Actually,I was suffering from hair loss but in short amount of period I found a very good improvements. I recommend everyone to use it.</li>
    <li> ADD TO BOOST OF CAFFEINE TO BOAST ABOUT YOUR LOCKS, April 17, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Lisa M. Butcher&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Wellness Coach, I have had the great opportunity and experience of trying different products and services to help transform people internally and externally. Along with this experience, I also attended many seminars and classes on products, ingredients, and how/why they work. Sometimes, things that are found in our homes, work in more ways then we could ever imagine (Vinegar, Olive Oil, Baking Soda, Sea Salt, are just some examples).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, in the case of Shampoo, and experiencing an increase in volume, length, vitality, CAFFEINE gets the job done. Ultrax gets the job done with this genius formulation. Scientific studies back this up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. CAFFEINE IMPROVES CIRCULATION&lt;br /&gt; It does so by its stimulating effect acting directly on the hair root. Studies confirm this showing a distinct increase in hair follicle growth&lt;br /&gt; (over 46%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. CAFFEINE PRODUCES LONGER HAIR ROOT VITALITY&lt;br /&gt; Studies indicate that hair follicles exposed to caffeine exhibit 37% longer life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. CAFFEINE PRODUCES LONGER HAIR&lt;br /&gt; Studies indicate the length of hair was increased between 33-40%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, if you want to &amp;#34;boast&amp;#34; about your locks, add a boost of caffeine. Ultrax Hair Surge Shampoo, will produce longer, stronger, healthier looking hair. The more frequently you use it, the better results. I see the best results when I shampoo with it, stimulating my scalp, and then letting it penetrate my scalp for a few minutes before rinsing. If you have fine, life-less looking hair, as I did....you will see extraordinary results in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s Looking At You!!!!</li>
    <li> This product has an awesome rejuvenating fresh scent, Love it! It is also very thick but does not lather well but my hair felt very clean.</li>
    <li> This product works great! I instantly noticed thicker, more dense hair after the first couple of uses. After a couple of weeks I definitely noticed more hair growth. This product works! Worth every cent! I recommend this for anyone that suffers hair loss or just wants thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I research a little and share with my friends and I was convinced that this product will help me to grow back my hair ....it took 2 bottles to begin and see results .. Now my hair has improve in thickness, texture and growth…I am very happy now my mom is also convince and  she is waiting for her Ultrax Labs..This product really works but it takes time and patience growing hair is a slow process dont think that the use of one bottle will be enough and if you have an scalp condition the ingredient Ketoconazole might help alleviate your condition. I will always use this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a joke.&lt;br /&gt;One month on this shampoo and nothing except more shedding! I also found out that most of the reviews are fake since the reviewers have only reviewed ultrax products. Stay away and save money. Minoxidil is the only effective solution.</li>
    <li> My hair started to slowly recede until I got this shampoo. It has even begun to grow back. Its a 2 in 1 product that cleans my hair and helps with my hair loss.  I&#x27;m so happy I found it before it was too late. If you are reading this review, and you are contemplating whether or not you should buy it, JUST DO IT! You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> General effect。Just control pomade，Do not waste your money  Only when the special shampoo  not good  Unfortunately, can not be returned</li>
    <li> So after just one use of this shampoo I immediately noticed a change. My hairs always been on the thinner side, and just one wash later I feel my hair is thicker! I am so excited to sdd what happens as I continue to use this shampoo. Definitely worth the price as I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss shampoos and coukdnt tell a difference. No more clumps of hair in the drain after a shower! I love it, couldn&#x27;t be happier. Nice lather and keeps my hair clean as well. Its a must for people with thin hair or hair loss!!</li>
    <li> I started losing my hair about 4 years ago, and it was going fast!  I tried another mainstream product for about 8 month, but it did not do much but make my hair feel greasy, and I was still losing hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this Ultrax shampoo for about a year and not only did my hair loss stop dead in it&#x27;s tracks, but my hair is thicker than it was over two years ago.  It also keeps my hair feeling clean and light!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the shampoo, it make my hair feel clean, healthy, thicker and longer in length. The price is inexpensive, it&#x27;s worth the price.  All you need is a little and it lathers real good. I will be ordering another couple bottles.</li>
    <li> With my super thin hair, I will try anything to hold on to what I&#x27;ve got. It&#x27;s easy to be a skeptic but when products live up to more than expected, I think it is worth telling others about. You will not be disappointed with Hair Surge &amp;#34;Caffeine&amp;#34; shampoo. It recommends leaving it on for at least two minutes. But, you will get even more benefit if you leave it on much longer. AND . . .be patient. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference right away. But you will.</li>
    <li> Im so glad I purchased this stimulating shampoo from Amazon!! Thank you so much for this shampoo! It works miracles. There are no harsh chemicals harming my hair and the shampoo leaves my scalp feeling clean and refreshed!!! I would recommend this product as a simple treatment for all types of hair!!! I will be purchasing more!!! I&#x27;ve seen tremendous results in my amount of hair growth in just one week.</li>
    <li> I’ve been taking Ultrax Lab’s Hair Maxx supplement for the past month. I was pleased with the results of that product, which included less hair shedding when I brushed, combed and washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the Ultrax Lab website and discovered they also offer a hair growth stimulating shampoo and conditioner. I decided to give the shampoo a try and ordered a bottle of the Hair Surge Shampoo from their Amazon store. The active ingredients in the hair supplement shampoo include caffeine, saw palmetto and ketoconazole, a powerful anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory ingredient common in dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using the Hair Surge Shampoo and Hair Solace Conditioner, on a daily basis, if you want to see less hair washing down the drain and more hair on the top of your head! Don&#x27;t worry if the shampoo doesn&#x27;t create as many suds as you&#x27;re used to. Shampoo which is overly sudsy can strip the natural oils from your hair and scalp causing dry hair and an itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I thought that I would give this shampoo a try and it was the best decision I made. the moment I put this shampoo on my head I felt a nice cool breezy sensation , I knew something went right ! And it actually made my head have a whole new texture!! My hair was stronger and fuller and I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product applies well you will need to spread it evenly as it can be hard to spread if application is in one spot. it give a nice tingly sensation as well as a nice cleansing feel for the sinuses with the mixture of the hot water. it works well as a cleansing shampoo and after one use i have noticed a slight difference in the feel and texture of my hair. that being said the recommended use of 5 times a week you will definable notice a difference after a week.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle comes with and easy to use nozzle that allows application with ease.&lt;br /&gt;it also has a very nice odor to it not to strong but pungent enough to linger after with a nice sensation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it already around 3 month. Don&#x27;t see much difference.&lt;br /&gt;But it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really work for me. If you are loosing hair don&#x27;t rely to much on miracle shampoo...&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo is  mostly made to clean your hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair and have been looking for something to help make it look and feel a little fuller. Regular volumizing shampoo hasn&#x27;t helped. After researching and reading reviews I decided to try this one. Hair Surge contains ingredients helpful to growing and maintaining healthy hair. These essential oils are important for conditioning and moisturizing hair and caffeine compounds known to stimulate hair follicles so hair grows faster. Two other important additions are Ketoconazole and Saw Palmetto. Ketoconazole is an anti-fungal usually used to treat dandruff, but it also stunts hair loss by blocking testosterone. Saw Palmetto, which has a long history in herbal medicine, increases hair density. Hair Surge foams to a nice lather, doesn&#x27;t have a weird chemical smell, and since I have short hair the 11 oz bottle seems to be lasting quite a while. I&#x27;m sure if you have long hair the number of uses might change. It&#x27;s recommended to keep on for 2-3 minutes like you would a regular conditioner, and when I rinse it off my head and hair feel clean and fresh, not oily. I would recommend this for sure, it&#x27;s a bit more expensive than regular shampoo, but you get what you pay for. Totally worth it in my opinion :-)</li>
    <li> Fake reviews. Way too many recent 5 star reviews. You really think every person that tries this loves it? Almost no one gives it anything but 5 stars... beware.</li>
    <li> After spending time looking on the internet, talking to friends and reading reviews; I finally listened to my beautician. I really didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for shampoo but I needed results. I tried Sulfer based on my own to stimulate my scalp (like webmd) says for hair growth but it stunk bad and didn&#x27;t do much. So I broke down and tried hair surge which my hairdresser had originally told me to try. Anyway, it SMELLS great, gets your real clean. It doesn&#x27;t lather up like typically shampoos so don&#x27;t freak out...its working. You will start to see a fullness and your hair gets stronger with everywash. I can&#x27;t wait to see my three month results. Get your sexy back!!!</li>
    <li> If you are thinking about purchasing this product because of those good review below , because of the high price and you think it going to work , then you have the same thinking I had before I purchased it . STOP here , It&#x27;s Not Work , 100% not work ....don&#x27;t be fool by those review and the price . I think this is a way they scam our Money .&lt;br /&gt;*Im a 29 years old man ,  I have been using it almost a month , and my hair still loss everynight I wash using this shampoo . Follow the instruction , wash 5 time a weeks , apply the samepoo on the hair and massage for 2 mins even 5 mins ....still loss hair every time i wash .&lt;br /&gt;* the funny thing is , the package was came in very unprofessional for a $43 product , the samepoo was in a plastic bag , the plastic bag like a shopping plastic bag .....</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my Ultra Lax Hair Growth Shampoo. It was delivered in great condition and not to mention fast! Plus with free shipping! My hair feels so much healthier and has much more body. My hair is noticeably stronger and I can tell my shedding has decreased as well. I LOVE their products! I’m going to purchase the conditioner ASAP. The ingredients meet my high standards and I can’t wait to see the future benefits. This was a great purchase and I will definitely be ordering from Ultra Lax again. I definitely recommend purchasing this shampoo- FIVE STAR PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Needless to say, I was anxious to find that my hair line was receding and my hair was thinning out. The first thought I had was to turn to hair plugs, but that is incredibly expensive and a cumbersome experience in general. Eventually I found this product and thought &amp;#34;what the heck, what have I got to lose?&amp;#34; Compared to the other hair treatment options, it didn&#x27;t cost much at all.&lt;br /&gt;Fast-forward to a week or so later. I definitely noticed a remarkably thicker scalp, and my hairline looks a lot better too. I didn&#x27;t have to do it anymore than it said to either, and it didn&#x27;t smell weird or anything haha. I don&#x27;t feel near as anxious or self-conscious anymore about my hair, so I&#x27;d say the product is quality. *****</li>
    <li> I have always had a problem with my hair shedding. I felt as if I would lose crazy amounts of hair after every shower. I have long hair and wanted it to look full instead of it look like it was thinning.  I have been using this shampoo and it has cut this problem drastically. I couldn&#x27;t believe it and it worked at the first use. I have followed the driections on the bottle and love my results so far. My little baby hairs are also growing!! I am in love with this product and would reccomend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Used Minoxidil years ago with little to no effect.  Within a week of using Ultrax Labs shampoo, definate signs of new hair growth can be seen ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the directions are followed and the shampoo is massaged into the scalp and allowed to set for 2 - 5 minutes.  It will produce a tingling scalp sensation that seems to indicate something is at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax Labs shampoo is definitely worth a try for anyone with hair loss issues.</li>
    <li> I never put much stock into hair products before until I tried Ultrax. It works great! After a couple weeks of using this almost every day there is absolutely no doubt that my hair has gotten much thicker and fuller. I didnt like that my hair was starting to look really flat and thin. I saw that there was a ton of great reviews on this product and thought why not. Everyone was right! This stuff is amazing and I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> First, I really like the citrus smell. A lot of brand name shampoos are just too sweet smelling for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re doing a 2 way test on this shampoo - me and my husband.&lt;br /&gt;Me - I wash my hair every 3 days. The Caffeine Hair Loss shampoo makes my hair smoother, less frizzy, and it looks a lot fuller. My hair isn&#x27;t shedding as much, too - that&#x27;s a big plus because it means I actually have MORE HAIR. I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo and I&#x27;m willing to pay the price. (Mature ladies must try this).&lt;br /&gt;My husband - he&#x27;s lost a lot of hair on top. The shampoo makes his hair look fuller, so he&#x27;s happy. He bought Rogaine and never tried it because it was too complicated to use, but shampooing is easy. We&#x27;re checking for hair regrowth, will get back with results, but his hair definitely looks thicker.</li>
    <li> Amount you get for the price is disappointing.  You have to use quite a bit to get a lather going in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t see any noticeable change except for my hair not feeling quite as clean.  Maybe that&#x27;s what people think is more hair, because its &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; because its not clean.</li>
    <li> After a week of use, I can already notice a difference. To be honest I had my doubts before I bought this product, but the good ratings convinced me to give it a try. I&#x27;m happy that I gave this product a chance because it really does work. I&#x27;ve already noticed my hair getting stronger and thicker and I&#x27;ve already started to see some new hair growing. I would recommend it for anyone that needs a little help with their hair growth and shedding. I will definitely be buying more of this product and recommending it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I want to share this with you guys because I know what a struggle it is dealing with thin hair that’s prone to breakage. If you’re like me, you stress about the possibility of the state of your hair getting worse as time goes on and wish that you could recover some of what was lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine and thin hairs naturally. It seems to have gotten worse as the years go by. I’ve especially had some thinning hair on one side of my hairline and I think it’s partly because of the way I’ve been styling my hair but since using this shampoo it has made my hair stronger, more robust and resilient to the stresses of styling it every day. I can now wear my favorite hairstyle without worrying about breaking my delicate hairs because they’re not so prone to damage anymore. I think it could even stand up to perm chemicals with how healthy it’s looking now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I was pretty skeptical of this product when a coworker told me about it. I mean, with all the gimmicky hair growth stuff out there on the market, who wouldn’t be a little timid at buying something that claims miracles. But on the other hand, this coworker of mine did have really nice hair. So I thought if it works for her, why shouldn’t it work for me? I’ll try it out and maybe she’ll be envious of my hair for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m thrilled to report that it’s a winner! I’ve even seen some tiny new growth hairs starting up! It’s also helping with my shedding. I’m not losing as many hairs as I used to. I didn’t expect results so soon, but hey I’ll take it. And thankfully, it doesn’t have any strange chemical smell you get with some of these other hair growth shampoos. I’m just so glad I’ve finally found something that makes my hair look full, shiny, and healthy.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results of this shampoo, my hair loss stopped completely and now it is stronger and beautiful and the best part is also longer.</li>
    <li> The hair recovery stimulating caffeine shampoo improves hair quality after one use. As simple as it is to use, it is effective and worth the buy. The hair surge shampoo improves the overall hair quality and there is a noticeable improvement in thickness. By increasing scalp vitality, the shampoo promotes thicker and healthier hair growth. My hair quality has noticeably shifted and looks amazing after using this product. This shampoo is perfect to use 4 to 5 times per week and leaves your hair smelling amazing. It is also affordable, especially for how much of a difference it makes in the appearance and overall health of my hair. I would recommend this product to anyone struggling with hair loss or anyone wanting thicker, voluminous hair at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> Despite having a full head of hair myself, I was unsure whether or not this product would work. To my surprise, I&#x27;ve noticed less hair coming off of my head when I brush after a few days of using this shampoo. I have also noticed a slight increase in hair volume as well. I can only imagine how effective and how drastically this product will work on someone with thinning hair, or losing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a little sticky when pumping it from the bottle, but appears as if it melts into your hair upon application. This is definitely a different, yet effective shampoo good for people who want to lose less hair and grow more back.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for last 3 weeks and now I can say it&#x27;s worth buying it.&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning I was doubtful but now difference is visible. I can feel my hair thicker and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;It works great without any smell.</li>
    <li> I needed to find a shampoo that would help out with my hair because it has been falling out and it felt like it just wasn&#x27;t growing anymore. I was a little hesitant to try anything new because these types of shampoos usually have that medicated smell to them. Fortunately, I found this one by Ultra Labs! It works great and I love the smell! Definitely will be recommending it to anyone looking for something that helps support hair growth</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and I began to see results after about a week or two. I had a bunch of friends of mine that told me about this product and how it worked for them. So, I decided to give it a try and it worked as it suggested on the advertisement. I&#x27;ve read a lot of good reviews about this product and this is one of the reasons why I gave it a shot. It really improved my hair and it has a very good fresh scent. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> as a 42 year old hair started to thin n fall out worse then ever, this product has my hair to where it was in my twenties full n thick sweet product</li>
    <li> I considered buying this product after an unfortunate accident with a small spiral brush that left me missing some hair but decided against it because as I went through the 20 pages of reviews I found only two for 2012, a smattering through 2013 and then a flood of reviews appearing every couple of days throughout 2014. This is a Red Flag and is typical of paid reviews.  If you don&#x27;t believe this happens, check out fiverr.com and put in a search for product reviews.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that the seller shipped my order way sooner than I expected. I was surprised 3 days later when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a natural blonde who constantly dyes her hair black, I&#x27;ve always got a lot of fall out when I shower, blow dry and brush my hair. I always worry that as a blonde, any shampoo I use will wash my color out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge for about a week so far and I&#x27;ve already noticed a huge difference with my fallout problem. My hair has been really shiny and I&#x27;ve been able to maintain my color! Not only does this stuff make my hair smell really nice and make it super shiny, its safe for colored hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone who is experiencing the same fallout issues or color fading issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more, from this seller as soon as I run out of my current bottle!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase! I am so delighted to have found a shampoo for me that promotes hair growth! I can use it whenever I wash my hair! I really like the fusion of topical ingredients which includes plant-based substances to revitalize my scalp and promote more volume. This shampoo even addresses an itchy scalp and dandruff. This American-made shampoo offers a lot of valuable benefits at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> This is freakin&#x27; Awesome! Seriously, though it has worked really well for me. By the powers of CAFFEINE my hair line has stopped receding and even started to grow back where it had receded. I was already a fan of caffeine in general; now I am caffeine&#x27;s biggest fan, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many other shampoos out there, this product doesn&#x27;t just wash out before it can work. Instead the shampoo was created so that it actually soaks into your scalp and increases the help of hair follicles. This was a big part of why I decided to try it out, because they actually took the time to make a quality product. Also the bottle looked cool and has a neat name: Hair Surge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea about that Ketoconazole is used in dandruff shampoo, but also works for hair growth and strength. It&#x27;s a nice bonus, because now I don&#x27;t have dandruff anymore either and my hair is super soft!  Another thing I really love is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical or girly perfume smell. I really hate washing with anything that has a strong smell. This product has a really mild scent that I would describe as &#x60;clean&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It has a nice lather and does not leave your hair greasy. Washes like regular shampoo.*</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this shampoo. It&#x27;s not harsh on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like other hair growth products do. It&#x27;s using a natural stimulant and it actually works. I saw results pretty quickly. It smells great and it&#x27;s a huge bottle so its a great buy. Cannot be more satisfied!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome! I&#x27;ve only had it for a week and already I see my hair filling in more.  I have some balding around the edges of my hair from wearing braids that have been giving me a major hard time.  Now I can see improvement and I am just loving it.  I will definitely keep this shampoo as the number one product in my hair care cabinet.  Nothing else has worked this good!  The price is not bad either considering the fact that the shampoo actually does what it says.  That makes it more than worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I’ve always had thin hair and as you age it tends to thin out even more, plus during the winter months I’ve notice quite a bit of shedding.  Over the years I’ve tried many different products, basically ones that promote added volume and shine.  I had read products with caffeine can help with hair loss so I decided to give this shampoo a try. After just a few days I noticed a lot less shedding and my hair had more volume, a big plus for me. Also, a nice added bonus is the shine it gave my hair plus the shampoo smells really good. Since my hair is just about chin length, I find using 1 or 2 pumps is enough and I can see this product lasting at least 4-5 weeks. This product does exactly what it claims to do and I am extremely happy with my purchase, I think it’s well worth the money and I would definitely purchase again.  Love it !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s (female) and have been having gradual hair loss for a few years, predominantly in the front (big no no). I tried supplements and the nioxin system and the results were nothing to write home about. There&#x27;s always a little bit of skepticism when investing money is a product like this. I purchased this about a month ago and within a couple of weeks I already see results. The most dramatic is the less frequent shedding that is occuring. I used to pull out clumps in the shower. Now, it&#x27;s a third of what it was. I&#x27;m also seeing new growth. Granted, it&#x27;s gray (boo!) but I can work with gray hair. I only wash my hair every 2-3 days (vs the product recommendation of 5x a week) and I&#x27;m beyond ecstatic with my experience, so far. I&#x27;ll update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, and found this shampoo. It works. Excellent!!! A must buy to take care of thin hair. I bought it again.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo because I&#x27;ve been noticing that my shower drain has been accumulating with more hair that I&#x27;d like to readily admit.  I&#x27;ve also noticed thinning in some areas.  I did some research and Saw Palmetto came up as a DHT blocker - DHT being the main causative factor in male and female pattern baldness.  The Ketoconozole component is an added bonus too, being an antifungal and is also supposed to stimulate new hair growth.  Caffeine is the other active part of this shampoo that I actually hadn&#x27;t heard about before, but some quick research verified it as another great ingredient for stimulating hair growth.  So that&#x27;s the scientific background of things, in a nutshell...at least the extent of my research via the internet.&lt;br /&gt;  So, now to the shampoo itself.  It has a pleasant smell, not too overpowering which is great.  It lathers easily and leaves my hair feeling rather clean after.  Once my hair dries, it has a nice healthy shine to it and looks and feels fuller.  In these winter months, my hair is frequently brittle and my scalp itchy and this has seemingly solved that problem.  As far as curbing my hair loss, only time will tell!  I&#x27;ve only been using this a few weeks.  If it hasn&#x27;t slowed down my hair loss completely, it certainly has given the appearance of slowing down my hair loss by giving that thickening, livelier appearance.  So, that&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
    <li> Lathering of the shampoo is nice, rinses out very well. Shampoo doesnt take over the smell of your hair, leaves your scalp feeling icey fresh,Bald Patches begun to fill in with baby hairs.Improved Quality of hair texture.Improvment of Hair Health overall all packed in a shampoo bottle it must be those natural ingredients . The 100% Satisifation Guarantee i suggest you dont overlook shouldnt even need it YMMV.</li>
    <li> Awesome worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the changes I have already seen in my hair.  If you just follow the instructions of the shampoo and use it to wash your hair 5 times a week, you&#x27;ll start seeing your hair become thicker and eventually fuller as well. I am glad I invested the money for this product, because in the long run, I definitely saved money from not buying other products that don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I had applied Ultrax all over my scalp not expecting anything, and after not even the slightest results after two or three days, I was ready to give up. I kept at it, and after a week of use, I started to see improvement. The hairline on my forehead started to show a little more thickness. My scalp wasn&#x27;t as visible and my hair felt less stringy and coarse. This is my second bottle of Ultrax, as the first one has done such a miraculous job of bringing my hair back to its vibrancy and youthfulness. Best part about that first week of waiting for results is that my hair smelled fantastic, better than most standard shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> It works, I love this shampoo my hear feels nice and it is growing too. I highly recommend, leaves my hair nice too.</li>
    <li> So after hearing countless raving reviews about this product, it would be an understatement to say I was pretty excited to give it a try. Just a couple weeks in and I am definitely not disappointed that I did! I am already getting comments about how healthy my hairs looks and to me it definitely looks noticeably thicker, especially around the front, where my hairline has been receding since my late teens (31 now). Also, I have noticed ALOT less shedding taking place in the shower. Before I would notice 10-20 hairs but since using this shampoo I would say its down to around 1-5! Some days I don&#x27;t even notice any hairs at all! I am very pleased with these results, especially so early, and I am very excited to keep seeing improvements. I know its a little on the pricey side guys, but this shampoo is worth every last penny in my opinion!</li>
    <li> First Thing’s First…. This product in 1 simple word is UNDENIABLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really never had thought about hair loss until I started to experience it myself and what a nightmare it has been. I thought my situation was going to be simply hopeless and nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I came across Ultra Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss / Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo which has now become my savior!!! Seriously that is what it has felt like – I have reversed my situation form loss of hair to now having a steady hair growth. With their special formula which Contains powerful caffeine and ketokanazole compounds they have shown to aid in hair growth supported by ongoing studies and the use of folks just like me.. Hair Surge contains 0.2% Ketoconazole and has not harmed me in any way shape or form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week there are major improvements which has now restored my confidence level and has I feeling empowered and upbeat at the same time? There are no strange smell of chemicals which is another major plus, it feels natural and because of the improvements I now go out more once again.

So please join me and get your hair back so you can be very proud.</li>
    <li> I always had thick hair, but just recently the hair along my hairline began thinning to the point of near baldness. I did my research and came across Hair Surge. Although the product is a bit pricey, You get what you pay for. With consistent  use as directed I noticed growth stimulation. I&#x27;m going to order a second bottle because I believe I used to many pumps trying to work up a lather. I&#x27;m also going to order the conditioner because I believe it might help expedite the process. Essentially this is a new staple in my hair care regimen, at least until I get my edges back!  This product is for all hair types.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;m a 30 year old male with a few balding spot on the back of my head and was beginning to feel hopeless then!  I tried this product and it was great,   a few weeks in and I started to feel some fuzz  I&#x27;m telling you this stuff works ! If your balding give it a shot take my word for it. PLUS it smells good!</li>
    <li> My friend recommended me this shampoo for my minor hair loss and I truly love it. I really enjoy the smell and how it makes my hair feel as well. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 wks now and I will be buying another bottle</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been working wonders on my hair. After just a few weeks of use there is a noticible difference in it&#x27;s volume and strength. My hair is shedding a lot less and feels thicker and healthier. I&#x27;ve also noticed more growth than normal which is really exciting. The product is fairly easy to lather and painless to apply. I will definitely purchase this shampoo again and am excited to see the results of long term use.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. It actually did what it says it will do. I will recommend this to anyone having a problem with hair loss.</li>
    <li> I bought this in combination with Biotin to resolve a part of my hair that isn&#x27;t bald, but it isn&#x27;t growing as much as the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, this stuff DOES work.  But it takes the whole bottle to see a noticeable difference.  That&#x27;s not a bad thing since it&#x27;s the only thing that actually did work, but you should be aware, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re going to see amazing results after 3-4 showers.  I was about ready to give up, but on a business trip (where I do apply this daily), I started seeing more hair in the places where it wasn&#x27;t growing heavily.  So I know it&#x27;s working.  I&#x27;ve run out of the Biotin a long time ago and it didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure that to get my hair back to what it used to be, I would need about 4 full bottles of this stuff.  Unless the rate of growth accelerates with use, which I didn&#x27;t see.</li>
    <li> This product is great. In addition to my hair becoming thicker and fuller, It gets your hair and scalp clean while making your hair shiny and silky. I am happy with the fact that I have only been using this for a short period of time and I already seen improvement. I notice less shedding after the shower and blow drying, which is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo to everyone.</li>
    <li> My best friend&#x27;s husband uses this product and he told me that for him it works really well, specially for dandruff control. I just received mine (it shipped rather quickly) and I just used it for the first time. I was afraid that the smell would be too strong or that I wouldn&#x27;t like the texture of my hair after using a hair loss prevention product, but I am quite pleased with the way my hair looks after washing it. We&#x27;ll see if in a month I have luck with hair loss. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for hair regrowth! Since it&#x27;s also a shampoo, I don&#x27;t have to worry about using extra products in addition to washing my hair. I definitely see an improvement in the look of my hair, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. It cuts back on time spent trying to use other products, and the push-action pump makes for easy use and convenience. I also love that is uses caffeine as an ingredient, it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve never seen before, but it works well!</li>
    <li> Great product--it left my hair shiny and smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t foam the way other shampoos foam, but, not to worry, it cleans just as well as any other shampoo.  There&#x27;s no need to use extra to get it to foam.</li>
    <li> Cleans really well.  I do not see these &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34; results everyone talks about.  It lathers well, cleans without reapplication and smells good. If it is assisting regrowth, I can&#x27;t see it, maybe others can...</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing and does exactly what it says it does! It made my hair feel smooth and full and voluminous! It even stopped my hair from falling out and it all around made me happy with my new luscious hair and this amazing product! I recommend it fully.</li>
    <li> For a better description it smell like oranges, feels/looks like thick yellow oil, takes a large amount to cover all of your hair and scalp and it is a small bottle plus the conditioner smells like clay and looks like it too just not as thick. Your supposed to use it 5 days a week but i only use it 3 days. Every time i take a shower a lot of hair comes out so i don,t take on every single day, my hair is to the point to where i can&#x27;t even brush my hair without a large amount of hair coming out, there&#x27;s hair on my pillow when i get up in the morning. I can&#x27;t straighten my hair or blow dry it and it hurts just to touch it, it just falls out all day to where my hair is extremely thin. Hopefully this stuff actually works.</li>
    <li> When i purchased this shampoo i wasn&#x27;t to sure i was gonna see the results i wanted but this companies products have continued to amaze me! it smells so good it feels good on your head, some people say it doesn&#x27;t lather well but it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;you dont need a lot so one bottle will last you awhile, you see results fast and its so refreshing i LOVE this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Anyone who is really interested in getting your hair back, or just thicker, knows keratin and other various nutrients and vitamins are important for your hair to grow. I would highly recommend this stuff!!</li>
    <li> I am not sure how but my hair loss stopped in the first use and it was BAD. Granted, I am reviewing this only after using it one day but I am simply amazed at how wonderful and nourished and really healthy my scalp felt today and my hair looked great. I really can&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were reading this, I would be skeptical but I guarantee to you that I am telling the truth. I can hardly believe it myself. I was not expecting such instant results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update after more prolonged use. So far, I am VERY pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Okay, I used this and the pills by the same company and handled my hair loss. I do believe this stuff works. My hair stopped falling out (more than normal) and it was falling out in clumps, to the point where I was so freaked out that I bought two wigs. I have not had to wear them though. I was sure with the amount of hair loss I was getting everyday that within weeks I would be almost bald. It was that bad. I am not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to be fair, I also did a lot of other things too like I stopped taking a certain drug that could have been the culprit but even so, that is not supposed to be an instant fix. I got on a better diet, starting sleeping more -- basically it was a wake up call to handle my health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I still feel these products helped right away.</li>
    <li> Hair Surge is amazing. My hair felt soft and healthy after only one use. After a few uses, people started to notice a difference, and asked where I got my hair done. I will tell everyone how well Hair Surge works. Simply amazing!!!</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt so soft and thick.  I feel a good tingling as soon as I use the product, which is great.  I would definitely recommend that if you have thinning hair, or when you brush your hair, there&#x27;s alot that comes off...try this product!!</li>
    <li> It works! Within a few weeks I noticed a difference! I am so pleased with this product. Thank you so much! Finally I can say &amp;#34;I love my hair&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> The product does everything as advertise. I was skeptical at first  but after a few uses I noticed a difference in my hair, it has begun to grow back fairly fast and I love the smell and lather of this product. I have tried more hard-core regimens, but they were harsh on my hair. Good thing  I discovered this shampoo and am a true believer. My hair is healthy, soft, shiny and no more bald spots. This is the best product for your hair that you could every buy&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for about 7 days. I have really thin hair naturally and now that I am going into my 40&#x27;s I am noticing even more thinning. With my very first use I noticed a dramatic reduction with the amount of hair that usually ends up down the drain, for me usually a couple hand fulls each shower. I&#x27;m now going on my 7th day and my hair feels a bit thicker and really soft. The strands are no longer falling out when I run my fingers through my hair!! I think the smell could be a little softer, but maybe that&#x27;s because I am super girly. So far I am pleased with the results and will up date my review when I hit my 30 day mark. I have a great feeling about this one!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I just started using the Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo and so far so good. After the first use I noticed that my hair was softer and felt refreshingly clean. I love it when my Shampoo smells good and leaves my hair feeling amazing. I would definitely recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I really like it. I notice that I am having less hair fallen out when I shower. You can barely see any soap when you rub it on our hair, but it feels clean though.  It has only been five days so I have not seen any new hair grow yet.  So far I like it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything, in fact I think it made my hair fall out faster. I stopped using it. Seems like there are some fake reviews on here.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something that would alleviate my hair thinning and falling out over the handful of years since I&#x27;ve been getting older (40&#x27;s). I&#x27;ve used Hair Surge several times now and can actually say (yes I was skeptic) it sincerely works! My hair is naturally curly so I do not use a comb or brush, but use my fingers-- to run through conditioner and products such as gel, mousse etc. When I do this, my hair usually comes out in my fingers in long strands :( This oddly did not happen when I used the Hair Surge shampoo. I noticed this on the very first shampoo. No hair in my hands from combing product through. My scalp feels stimulated and my hair feels thicker. No more hair falling out. Now I will get my husband to try it as well. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I chose this shampoo because I want my hair to grow longer.&lt;br /&gt;At the moment my hair now is it the longest I ever had it in my life, and it just got to the point that it  stopped growing, no matter what I tried, so if Hair Surge Shampoo will give my hair at least an inch of lengths I will be very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I expected the bottle to be bigger, it 8 oz pay attention to it.&lt;br /&gt;When you apply Hair Surge Shampoo it feels like one of expensive saloon masks, it is doesn&#x27;t create a lot of foam, so try to mix it a little bit with the water before you use it, other way you will run out of it very fast.&lt;br /&gt;From first time using it I already noticed that Hair Surge Shampoo took care of my dandruff that I got from my previous hair care. The hair feels very clean and looks shiny.&lt;br /&gt;For now i am happy with the buy I will update this review in a month.</li>
    <li> My hair is not at all thinning but I do have fine, dry hair with an itchy scalp. I regularly blow dry my hair and finish styling with a curl iron.  The constant blow-drying and Ironing made the ends of my already thin hair extremely weak causing breakage.  I have tried every shampoo out on the market and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve notice less of my hair falls out, new hair has been growing in, and even better… My hair is showing so much body since I started using it.  The shampoo seems to have a sticky texture when you pumping it into your hand, but softens into your hair as you apply it.  Since it has to sit for 2-5 minutes before rinsing the clean therapeutic sent becomes more and more noticeable. It’s a clean smell with a honey undertone and very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt; I’m so happy to have found this shampoo. I no longer have an itchy scalp and my hair looks and feels healthy and it’s noticeably stronger with more volume.  I would recommend this shampoo for people with all types of hair.  Even those lucky enough that have perfect locks… It’s almost like a vitamin rinse! I love it!</li>
    <li> The product is honestly amazing. I am always looking for a product that can grow my hair, without too many breakage, or washing. This product has created wonders in my life. After just two weeks of using the product I can already see the difference in the length of my hair, the fullness of it, and the cleanliness as well. I love the feeling that it gives me when I&#x27;m washing my hair, and how much better it looks throughout the day. It can handle the weather, being cold, or massive heat and it doesn&#x27;t break or take away the moisture from my hair, it is amazing. I would recommend that everyone, looking to improve their hair length, get this product right away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and I notice a difference already in the length of my hair. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> What a surprise it was to open package and see these very tiny 8 oz. bottles inside.  Buyer be warned!</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! The item arrived super fast and was well packaged. I have only used it once - but with unbelievable results!!! My hair feels and looks thicker after only one shampooing. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after one month of use. If it continues to make my hair feel and look so much better, then I will definitely buy again. Buy it and try it!</li>
    <li> This has made a huge difference in how my hair looks.  I wasn&#x27;t too pleased to find out I was losing hair in my mid twenties but luckily this product has been a great help.  My hair looks just as full as it did before and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> almost stopped my hair loss - best product I have used for far</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for my thinning hair, I use it 5 times a week and it has definitely helped, even my hair dresser has noticed!</li>
    <li> Great product.  This shampoo has a light citrus smell and cleans my hair thoroughly without making it feel dry. Plus, my hair looks and feels thicker since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I have had thin, fine hair all my life and tried many products that promised to make my hair thicker - without any results. Finally I have found a shampoo that really thickens my hair. I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Expensive. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. It does not lather. At all! I have to use so many pumps of this to feel like I&#x27;ve covered my scalp. I leave it on and sometimes use other shampoo to get the bottom of my hair. I don&#x27;t feel like this does anything at all. I am taking biotin 5000 micrograms, that is working. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad Ultrax Labs has developed this shampoo!  I don&#x27;t like taking pills, but was getting ready to do so after seeing so much of my hair left in my brush or going down the shower drain.  There is not a chemical smell nor a lot of perfume; just a pleasant scent.  After reading so many great reviews about this shampoo, I felt confident that it was a product I could use, and I&#x27;m not disappointed!  It feels nice on the hair, and leaves it soft and manageable.  The price is higher than the average shampoo price, but this is no ordinary shampoo!  It delivers.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to take a less-invasive, drug-free route to bringing back a great head of hair!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this shampoo to my family and friends, this shampoo made such a difference in the very first use!  My hair feels and looks so much thicker and fuller.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Because of this shampoo, I no longer am ashamed of my dull, thinning, lifeless hair. Like most I started to loss my hair around my edges and in the center of my head. It was so embarrassing. The first thing I did was try all of these expensive and useless products. Until I found Ultrax Hair Surge Caffeine Shampoo, I was lost in this world. I have my bouncy and shiny hair back. This shampoo is feels different on my scalp and different as you lather. It gives a sensation of being alive (tingle) and is thick so be sure to work it in. The results were great for me. I started to notice hair growth after just a couple of washes. I think my hair overall is healthier now that I am using the caffeine shampoo. I have gotten compliments and I tell all of my friends that have thinning hair. This is the way to go!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hair loss remedies without success, but with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge, I noticed significant hair growth in balding areas in just the first 2 weeks of use. The shampoo creates a thick lather that cleans the scalp and hair like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I am thrilled to see new hair growth where I thought none was possible. This is a great product!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo actually works. I recommend using it as explained on the label, at least 5 times per week to see better results. After a few days of using it I have noticed that my hair is thicker and that gives me confidence. Also, the smell of this product is great. Since it does work is really more an investment than an expenditure.</li>
    <li> Super awesome product great smell. My hair is feeling healthier and fuller then ever. I love the feeling when my wife runs her fingers thru it.. Feels great.. Thank you</li>
    <li> Wanting beautiful, silky, luxurious hair is natural. However, beauty is overrated, as is its price tag. Wouldn&#x27;t you rather get the best results for as little money as possible? In my opinion, relying on stupidly expensive \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; shampoos, conditioners,  and supplements is a waste of time and hope. Yes, I&#x27;m saying this shampoo (Ultrax or whatever) is a waste. You&#x27;re better off going all natural, since the shampoos and conditioners you&#x27;ve been using all your life have been clogging your hair and making it filthier. They&#x27;ve also made you addicted to them. Ever notice how your hair gets greasy only a day or two after shampooing? That&#x27;s because the ingredients are designed to keep you coming back for more, to force you to wash every single night. Companies make more money that way. Just think about it, no one had to worry about this crap a hundred years ago. Why? Because their hair didn&#x27;t get all goopy within 24 hours after taking a bath! For dogs, it takes a few months before their hair needs attention. We&#x27;re the ones who have been duped. This is my solution: wash your hair using a baking soda paste and to condition it, use apple cider vinegar. This sounds weird, but believe me when I say it seriously cleans your hair, and not only that, but it feels and looks awesome. The first time I did this, my hair was so light and fluffy. I was amazed when I ran my fingers through my wet hair because they went through so easily. The idea is to stop using shampoos and conditioners, and instead wash your hair occasionally using baking soda and apple cider vinegar. Right now, I can go an entire week before I need to clean my hair (I do rinse my hair every night). Please don&#x27;t be grossed out. My hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy for the whole week. Seriously. No kidding. Eventually I wont need to do it nearly that much. Here is a link to a great article that will explain everything:     http://thehairpin.com/2011/04/how-to-quit-shampoo-without-becoming-disgusting     The author is funny andwill tell you step by step how to do this. As far as hair regrowth goes, you could always creat your own creams. Find some liquid caffeine online or at a health food store, add some other liquid or powder ingredients that are great for hair growth and apply it. You don&#x27;t need to spend so much money on a shampoo that may or may not work for you. Plus, this way you really know what you&#x27;re putting on your skin.     I hope this helps someone. You might also consider making your own toothpaste, deodorant and dishwashing / clothes detergents. Finding recipes online is easy and the recipes are always simple and usually quick. This will also save you money in the long run. I make all of these myself. (Just this week I made my own deodorant and it works better than anything store bought.)</li>
    <li> As a woman, I totally panicked when I noticed my hair was thinning in the front! I figured I would at least give this product a try.  I was skeptical about this shampoo at first, but I was blown away with the results!  Right away my hair stopped shedding so much, and pretty soon I noticed my hair regrowing in the thinning spots.  My hair is now thicker, fuller, and just feels healthier.  I am so so glad I tried this stuff out- it was a life saver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried their supplements and decided to buy this shampoo. I&#x27;m absolutely happy with this shampoo. It&#x27;s a great product that delivers great results. I bought this product about 4 months ago to help out the problem with the thinning/strength of my hair. I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the results. I started to see my hair getting a lot more thicker and stronger. My hair feels softer and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering, I noticed a decreased amount amount of hair left over. My brush is not overwhelmed with my hair anymore and my hair stylist has noticed the significant difference. I look forward to use this shampoo in the morning because it&#x27;s so invigorating.</li>
    <li> still waiting for the expected result, good clarifying shampoo for daily use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the science that goes into this shampoo, but who cares? It works - or at least it works for me. I&#x27;ve always had thin hair and have been jealous of my siblings who all have really thick hair. In fact, a running joke in my family is that my parents, who also have thick hair, must have adopted me. Of course, it&#x27;s never been as amusing to me as to the rest of the family. Only weeks after I started using the product on a daily basis I started receiving comments about how great I looked. People even thought I had changed my hair style even though the last time I&#x27;d been to the barber was before I started using the shampoo. Of course, my wife knows the truth and all of a sudden she can&#x27;t resist running her hands through my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the negative reviews, I get it. It&#x27;s not cheap and not everything works for everyone. But obviously it works for most people. Besides, with the 100% satisfaction guarantee, you can&#x27;t go wrong by trying.</li>
    <li> My hair has falling outs since I was a teenager. I truly believed by the time I hit high school I was going to be bald. Surprisingly enough it&#x27;s still in tact, but finding a shampoo that keeps it together is hard. Many store products I used still pull at my hair and it&#x27;s very difficult if not maintained properly. That includes using a comb and not a brush after washing to undo tangles or properly massaging shampoo into my scalp instead of rushing. Hair is important and like skin care you need the right tools to keep it 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price the product lasts a long way. I mean I use only two pumps and my hair is good. I feel it lather into each of my follicles and leave my hair stronger than the last use. There is a slight stinging sensation, but I used to have my hair bleach and it&#x27;s nothing like that and to me just means that it&#x27;s working. There has been no breakouts or damage so I&#x27;m loving it so far. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out more hair or leave it unmanageable. Please note that if you are a religious everyday shower type of person like me, this product needs to be used sparingly. You don&#x27;t need to dash a marathon with it and expect results. It strengthens with each use in my opinion because I see a difference when I style my hair or just run my fingers through it. Will definitely add it to my daily regime!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I started using it and I can already tell a difference in my hair. I&#x27;ve used it about 8-10 times so far. My hair feels stronger and thicker and I&#x27;m seeing a bunch of baby hairs growing. I can&#x27;t wait to see the continued results over the next few months! Not to mention, my hair smells great afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great product, my hair is growing back</li>
    <li> My husband started losing his hair after a month of using this crap. The positive reviews are fake. This is the worst shampoo for hair loss. I wish I would never get it. Damn these crappy companies that produce s*** to make money. They absoloutly don&#x27;t care about people.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and I am happy with the product. It seems expensive for such a small bottle but you only need a little bit if you have an average male hair cut (sorry ladies!). It smells good, lathers well, and the pump is also quality. I have noticed my hair has stopped falling out since starting this shampoo. Every time I used to dry my hair, I would see hair fall out and hair would hang on my face on the way down. Now, they are nearly all gone. I can run my hands through my hair, shake it, and nothing comes out! I really pleased about this, it really does work. The only problem is my eye has started twitching and I don&#x27;t know if it is from the caffeine (despite it just being topical). Maybe I&#x27;m leaving it in too long. Definitely worth the 43 dollars....</li>
    <li> Menopause brought me hair loss as a gift! I thought there was nothing I could do about it until a girlfriend gave me a bottle of her Ultrax Labs shampoo. I could not believe how much body and thickness my hair had after using this shampoo for a little while! The shampoo also gives you a nice tingly feeling in your scalp as you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks. The first thing I noticed was I was losing less hair when I showered or brushed my hair. I would definitely recommend this product. This shampoo has been a godsend! I feel young again when I brush my hair. I want other women to have the same experience as I did and feel good about themselves again!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a great item just started using and smells good. Starting to notice a little difference. Good item.</li>
    <li> It really works!!! I would DEFINITELY recommend it to anyone who needs it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because I hadn&#x27;t had any luck with any other product so far but after 3 weeks of use I was made a believer in this product.  The first thing I noticed was the sudden decrease in hair loss.  I was no longer pulling hair out of the drain, brush and off my pillow.  After that the results just kept coming, both myself and the woman who has been cutting my hair for years mentioned my increase in growth in trouble some spots.  I have nothing but good things to say about this product.  I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s had thinning hair or trouble with balding spots.</li>
    <li> As a 55 year old male I am lucky to have hair, but my hair line has been receding over the last few years.  I had low expectations for this product, but after reading the reviews thought I would give it shot.  Too my amazement I can see some hair growth coming in.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how thick it will get but I am really happy with what I see so far.  My hair has a nice smell after showering.  Other products I have tried leave a medicine type smell.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for some hair growth or hair retention....</li>
    <li> One of the best shampoos that I have ever used.  I have been using it for a week and my hair already feels thicker and stronger.  Another great thing about this shampoo is that I am not getting shampoo build up that makes my hair feel greasy while at the same time it isn&#x27;t completely drying out my hair.  Love it and definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I already have thick hair but this made my hair eve thicker. Its smells nice and it made my hair stronger.I&#x27;m transitioning from a perm to natural hair so this really helps keep my hair strong while it goes through this process.</li>
    <li> (Update after three months of usage)  this product, believe it or not, DOES work for minor hair loss or thinning. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure or anything so keep that in mind while reading the review.    The shampoo contains a few ingredients which are recognized to aid in treating hair loss, such as Sawtooth Palmetto and Keta. I used one or two pumps a day, ~5 times a week (the suggested amount of usage). It should be noted, my hair loss wasn&#x27;t considered major, it was mostly just some thinning towards the crown and barely noticeable recession. All my hair felt less dense. Here&#x27;s a pretty decent timeline of happenings:  First use - hair immediately felt stronger and thicker. I imagined this was a short term cosmetic implication, like using some kind of product to make your hair _look_ thicker. Either way, it felt and looked good  Two weeks in - at this point, I noticed while washing my hair that very few hairs came out. Much less than usual. Instead of maybe 10 little hairs, I&#x27;d see about 1. I&#x27;d shed less in general, too. This was the first big surprise to me, that it was actually working  One month - I noticed my hair started to feel denser. It looked more \\&quot;balanced\\&quot; in growth; instead of having any patchy growth (loose around the crown, dense on back and sides), every area seemed to be growing roughly equally, which was a noted change  Two months - anyone with thinning knows it&#x27;s very apparent when your hair is wet. Now, while wet, the patchy areas began closing up and becoming consistent all around.  Three months - hair had reached the point where I forgot there was even originally a problem. I use this regularly now and love it    so yes, it does work, and I would recommend it.  As for other details, it smells... okay. Not good, not bad. Citrusy with a kind of chemical-like undertone. The amount that you get in the bottle can last a pretty good 2 months, depending on how often and how much you use it. I used the recommended dose from the instructions</li>
    <li> For a senior citizen, I thought my hair was pretty healthy - fairly thick, full, with just the smallest of a receding hairline. But, after just a few uses of this product, everyone is commenting on how much thicker and shinier and fuller my hair looks now. Shampooing with this Ultrax Labs product certainly feels nice too; my hair and scalp just plain feel better after using the shampoo in the shower. Recommend it? You bet! Wholeheartedly!</li>
    <li> Unsatisfied. I still lose lots of my hair. I did notice a slight increase in hair thickness. Hair loss is still there.</li>
    <li> Used for 3 months. Reason-To re-grow hair. Saw no re-growth. I eat healthy and excerise</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my fiance with high hopes for success after reading the reviews.  He didn&#x27;t notice any changes in hair loss or growth stimulation so the product didn&#x27;t make any difference for him.  He used the whole bottle and decided to switch back to Nioxin as he had more confidence in those products.  It was worth a shot but didn&#x27;t live up to our expectations.</li>
    <li> I gave this shampoo as a gift to my dad who is nearing sixty years old and just now showing signs of hair loss. His hair is actually great for his age. He doesn&#x27;t have bald spots or anything like that but his hair is getting noticeably thinner. I visited him at his house two weeks after giving him this shampoo and I could undoubtedly see a difference in his hair. It seemed to be thicker and almost more colorful. We spent almost a half an hour that day talking about how well the shampoo actually worked (also joking about his old age... which is nothing to be ashamed of by the way). He told me he used it for the recommended five days a week, once a day. He liked how clean his hair felt and especially how it looked. He also claimed that he noticed a difference in his hair just a week after using it but I can&#x27;t say for sure if that is true or not. And I&#x27;m sure for someone with much longer hair than my dad&#x27;s that this shampoo would take much longer to produce the results desired. But all in all, the shampoo cleaned good and stimulated hair growth like it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product took my dad&#x27;s great, aged hair and actually made it even better. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I think its worth it if you&#x27;re desperate to make a slight improvement in your hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! There is no cure for baldness. This shampoo isn&#x27;t the answer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now and I&#x27;ve noticed no increased growth in hair.  For me, it actually made my hair fall out even more compared to other drug store brand shampoos.  It is extremely difficult to lather since the shampoo is so viscous and thick.  Despite that, the shampoo isn&#x27;t very moisturising or beneficial to my hair texture.  It&#x27;s actually made my hair feel very coarse and brittle, thus making a moisturising conditioner an absolute must.  Normally, my hair is pretty straight and thin, but soft and easy to manage regardless of my hair falling out.    Would not recommend.  The scent is nice I suppose.  But at $40 - 50 per bottle, you&#x27;re really not buying it for the scent now are you?</li>
    <li> This product is unlike other shampoos for hair loss - it actually works in a short period of time. I never thought that caffeine would be affective on hear growth, but it works! The bottle is a very good size, and even if you wash your hear every day, it will last an entire month. I find that I can go for two days without using it and still get the same great results. I love the smell, the texture and how little of the product you need to use. I am a true believer!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed at this product! It has worked so fast and the more I use it the less and less my hair falls out. My hair used to fall out all day when I brushed it, touched it and washed it. There is almost no loss of hair anymore. It makes my hair feel really clean and so far I am loving this product!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great, a small amount about two pumps produces great lather, hair feels clean n soft after shampoo. Noticed my edges getting thinner so I decided to buy this......already seeing growth on my sides where thinned and growth where I was completely bald. I&#x27;d recommend</li>
    <li> Never noticed a difference in hair growth. Shampoo doesn&#x27;t foam and doesn&#x27;t make hair feel clean. A small fortune for nothing.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m normally hesitant to put any shampoo in my hair because of the issue of discoloration, I was happy to find that my hair&#x27;s color actually was improved because of this product. I noticed instead of my hair becoming gray and coarse, it was shiny and easier to style than previously. One of my favorite things about this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t have excessive foam; foam for the sake of foam is one way of looking at it. It has a nice smell and appearance, and moves through the hair in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t feel in any way like a cheap product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows incredibly fast on its own because of my general hair care, but I can tell that this shampoo is speeding up the process! I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs has created something special with this shampoo. The powerful contents of caffeine and ketokanazole (anti-fungal) really make an impact on the hair growth and thickness of the hair as the product promotes. It should be used consistently by everyone trying to grow back lost hair or someone looking for a different solution for hair loss treatment. By using this product hair growth should not only happen faster but thicker and healthier as well. I recommend this product and suggest buying two bottle to start because the product works just that well.</li>
    <li> Works great! My hair feels softer, smoother and thicker! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! So far I am very pleased with the results.  I have been using it now for 2 months and just recently bought my third bottle.  My hair is getting thicker.  During the first week I was skeptical because there was noticeable hair lose but by my third week that changed and there was almost none.  I definitely plan to continue using this product and hope that the results from using it will only get better with time. The shipping with this product seems to always be expedited as well I ordered this product on Sunday with standard free shipping and got it today.  I certainly cant argue with that!</li>
    <li> Helps to keep hair growing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is garbage. Made my hair fall out and is full of chemicals. Only use an organic shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> One star for not smelling too chemical. Caffeine grows hair? Since when? Ketoconazol is an anti fungal. I have tried for 6 weeks along with conditioner and the after shower alcohol gel. No results whatsoever. I&#x27;d be very skeptical of all the glowing reviews must of which appear fake. Hard to see a shampoo that is only in the hair for just a few minutes doing much anyway. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Shampoo is a wonderful shampoo. It provided my hair with strength, and thickness from the very first use as it stated it would on the bottle. The smell is very minty and I actually like that. It does give my scalp a nice tingle, and I can feel the stimulation during the lathering. The bottle has a push down dispenser like a hand liquid soap bottle would, I find that very helpful rather then pouring and squeezing more product than needed into my hand and overusing. This shampoo has caffeine, peppermint oil, mango butter and saw palmetto extract in it, and I think it makes for a great shampoo. It didnt give my hair a crispy feeling like other shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few months now, and I have yet to be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, I&#x27;m a hair product snob - it&#x27;s true.  And it&#x27;s so annoying when the products I buy don&#x27;t live up to the hype ... at all.  So, I was a bit apprehensive about this shampoo at first, but now, it&#x27;s pretty much all I use.  Not only does this shampoo clean the heck out of my hair, it has also helped my hair to grow immensely.  Within the past few months, I&#x27;ve gained an additional 2-3 inches on top of my normal growth.  Obviously, everyone might not have my luck, but it&#x27;s worth a shot, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo.  Oh, and my boyfriend (who is prematurely losing some of his hair) loves it, too.  It has helped him quite a bit with his receding hairline.  It&#x27;s like magic in a bottle.  Just buy it!</li>
    <li> Caffeine hair shampoo, who would have thought?! I shed like crazy and my husband is balding in the front. After just a couple of weeks, his hair is getting thicker and mine is not shedding at all! Not only is this stuff affordable but its like a miracle cure all for hair loss. It&#x27;s easy to use and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I will be recommending this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works well, but just like any hair product you&#x27;re not going to get results overnight! But the wait is worth it ! Good quality and quality overall !</li>
    <li> I am a female with long hair,  the ends are at my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been fight with one spot, just to the right of the crown of my head.  There is a thin patch and it has become more difficult to style my hair without being self conscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product in hopes that it would help, and I am seeing results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, my hair feels great and my troublesome spot is not parting as much.  I am going to continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fragrance is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with ultra labs hair surge. After only a few uses I noticed a change with my hair. My hair is fuller, lighter, and cleaner. After styling, the style lasted longer than when I styled before.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this shampoo.....after 3 weeks of use shedding a bit less hair...I think. Pricey stuff but if I get convinced I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
    <li> So far nothing different,hair feels clean but you can get the same results with any other shampoo for less money.</li>
    <li> Bought this to see if it would help me regrow hair on patches I have. My scalp and hair feel squeaky clean. its helping me grow the rest of my hair very fast, def would buy again</li>
    <li> This product smells great :) I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little while but my hair already seems fuller!</li>
    <li> Finally a hair product that works! My mother had been taking homeopathic remedies for years to get her hair thicker , fuller, and growing. Until she started using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge she had no luck! My mother has been so impressed with the results my wife is even excited about trying this product. I would have to recommend people seeking these type of results should start using this today.</li>
    <li> I just started using this 4 weeks and my shedding has virtually stopped, I love the volume it gives my hair best shampoo I have used and I recommended to my friends. I will wait a month to see if I should give 5 stars so far so good</li>
    <li> I consider myself to be caffeine sensitive. If I have a cup of coffee in the morning, it&#x27;s difficult for me to sleep at night. I was concerned that using this product it might effect my sleep patterns, but I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different. The shampoo has a citrusy - cola smell that is unusual but pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t lather well, but I consider that to be a good thing as it&#x27;s easier to apply to the roots and scalp. After a few weeks of use I have noticed reduced shedding and softer shinier hair.</li>
    <li> Nothing that this product did for me (by the way, all it did for me was shampoo my hair and leave it feeling a little poofy with a bubblegum-ish scent) justified the 40-something price tag. I&#x27;d say more, but there isn&#x27;t really anything else to say. It has a nice bottle with a pump... cool?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one further note: Some other reviewers of this product have noted that some if not many of the positive reviews are suspicious and possibly even illegitimate. So, be weary when reading those reviews...</li>
    <li> Its real caffeine for your hair, use it after shampooing. You will feel the affects a few minutes after applying to scalp. Its minty leaving your scalp feel like its breathing. just do not apply a huge amount remember its caffeine. It made my curly hair stretch out straight. Giving it the fuller and longer effect.</li>
    <li> Best hair regrowth product anywhere. It lasts a long time. I&#x27;m at three months with religious daily use.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge is a fantastic and highly innovative product.  Ultrax Labs has created a unique formula, which includes caffeine, ketoconazole, and saw palmetto.  Caffeine promotes hair growth by stimulating the follicles in your scalp.  Ketoconazole is an antifungal that repairs fungal or bacterial causes of an unhealthy scalp, including dandruff.  Saw palmetto blocks an enzyme that causes hair loss.  Combined, these active ingredients not only promote hair growth, hair quality and scalp vitality, but they also prevent hair loss.  This product essentially combats hair loss at both ends, which is what makes it so effective.  And unlike other hair growth shampoos, Hair Surge actually smells good!  As an added bonus, Ultrax Labs Hair Surge is made in the USA, so you can help our economy and your scalp at the same time.  I highly recommend Ultrax Labs Hair Surge to anyone who wants to regrow their hair, or simply improve the quality of their hair.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s too early yet to say whether or not this works, but as a shampoo, I find that I like it. It has a really nice, fresh smell, and it made my hair feel squeaky clean. But as a hair restorer, I reserve judgement until I&#x27;ve used it a few weeks.  But my scalp felt tingly, so I know something&#x27;s going on! I&#x27;ll post again when I have more to report.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my mum. Her hair isn&#x27;t as thick as it used to be. She loves it and I can see the difference in the fullness of her hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s still too early to tell. I am on my second bottle and will give it more time. Using it 5 times a week is too much washing for my hair, so maybe I will have to wait longer to see noticeable results.</li>
    <li> Got it for my aunt who&#x27;s been having hair loss problem for a couple years now. She just recently hit me up saying how happy she is with the product, that according to her, work wonders. She&#x27;s tried a lot, and I mean A LOT of different shampoos, masks, creams, etc., to help with the hair loss. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve heard her being this excited about a product yet. Five stars for that!</li>
    <li> I really wish I would have read the negative reviews before purchasing. Waste of money and I am now experiencing even more shedding than before. Now when the hairs come out I can even see the follicles at the end of the hair which can&#x27;t be good. I really do believe the 5 star reviews are scams. Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> I have had long, thick, waist length hair my entire life.  In the past few years aging, stress, and the hormones from pregnancy left my hair thinning, breaking, and falling out.  I have tried many products currently on the market to try to combat this problem, but up until this point nothing has worked for me.  After using this product repeatedly, I have seen a noticeable strengthening of my hair which has led to less shedding.  My hair looks fuller, especially on the top of my head where the thinning had been the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Surge Shampoo has a rich, thick consistency and a light, neutral lime scent.  The pump bottle makes application very easy.  The shampoo makes a decent lather.  Instantly you feel a tightening and tingling in the scalp.  Hair begins to feel tighter and more secure in the follicle, resulting in fewer strands falling out.  Shampoo rinses out easily and leaves hair feeling clean and conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does work if you give it the time and use it as directed.  I shampoo with it every day, and leave it on my hair for the required 2 minutes before rinsing.  Over time you will see a noticeable improvement.  My hair feels thicker, fuller, and less fragile.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair smells and feels using this.  It leaves it clean and I can see it thickening.</li>
    <li> I like it! Using like a regular shampoo, but couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results, simply amazing ! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have extremely baby fine hair in the front and am happy to have found a product that promotes hair growth. I absolutely love the lemony scent that this product brings to your hair, it leaves your hair feeling rejuvenated and soft! This is definitely a product that I recommend for those looking to add thickness to their hair. Great product for the value :)</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but wow was I surprised. This shampoo really works! I noticed results after just a short period of use. It does everything it promised and I&#x27;m very happy. My hair is thicker and old thin spots are already starting to fill in. Not only is my hair fuller but its smooth and smells great too. I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo to anyone even if you&#x27;re not experiencing hair loss but simply want a thicker, fuller head of hair.</li>
    <li> This product is phenomenal. Definitely worth the price! Just use it 3-4 pumps a day and be patient. You will see the results. It&#x27;s definitely working well for me. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to try this caffeine based product based on the high claims and pricing but was very pleasantly surprised. It is a little more than I would normally spend but after my hair started growing back at the beginning of week two, I was hooked. And I must say, when a product works this well, it is hard to put a price on feeling and looking GREAT. I have tried a handful of other products for hair loss but none that I feel confident using long-term until now. I also love that everything is in one bottle and there is no lengthy six-step process. The smell is awesome, my hair feels refreshed and light after use; This stuff is good, period.</li>
    <li> I have a whole family of men who are losing/have lost their hair. Along with other steps, this conditioner and shampoo brand has kept me with a full head of hair. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant initially because this is my first experience using a caffeine based shampoo, but I&#x27;ve been more than satisfied with Hair Surge! I have had trouble with retaining growth and hair thinning, but with this product it seems I don&#x27;t have to worry any longer. I&#x27;ve noticed very positive results in a short amount of time and was more than happy to find this product on Amazon at such a great price point! Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a shampoo that actually works towards your goal of less hair loss!</li>
    <li> It works very well.. I love it. It feels good on my scalp also. i&#x27;ts very stimulating...&lt;br /&gt; It makes your hair beautiful..&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ts nice and full and getting longer. I swear my hair has grown over an inch this a week alone.</li>
    <li> This Ultrax Labs hair shampoo is amazing. This product goes on smooth and after a couple times of using it I can feel it making my hair thicker and stronger. Another plus is it leaves your hair feeling smooth after you wash it out. The smell is nice and not overly scented like a lot of shampoos out there. The ingredients are all natural and are known for helping promote hair growth and health so overall I will give it 5 stars and will probably be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo really exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;m on my first bottle and I have already started seeing results. I am pleasantly surprised. And, like others said, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like a lot of other shampoos do, which is nice!</li>
    <li> Slow down the hair loss but no grow</li>
    <li> Showering is a happy part of my day now! thinking my hair is getting thicker and not thinner!&lt;br /&gt;I am 26 years old and i saw my hair was thinning, i started using ultrax labs hair products and ever since i have had GREAT success with them. i started using this shampoo for a month now and you can see the difference. I have  seen a further decrease in the amount of hair I am shedding after a shower and throughout the day; it is thicker, stronger &amp; healthier&lt;br /&gt;I combine this shampoo with another product of Ultrax Labs here it is i also recommend it 100%&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Ultrax-Blocking-Nutrient-Solubilized-Supplement/dp/B00BFFQMBA/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top&lt;br /&gt;It gives a nice smell and after smoothing feel to your hair.</li>
    <li> did nothing for my hair loss. I also have to apply a bunch so that it lathers...I feel like my hair soaks it all up and I have nothing left to actually clean my hair with. Not to mention the bottle is super tiny...probably the size of 5 travel sahmpoos</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much hair regrowth but it did stop from further hair loss.</li>
    <li> It really works! I used to loose a lot of hair when I would shower and comb, but after 2 weeks, that stopped. I started noticing new growth at my hairline and crown. The individual hairs on the top of my head had gotten thinner, but this shampoo has made them thicker again returning my hair to it&#x27;s original texture and making it consistent overall. My hair has become much fuller and thicker. As an added bonus, it&#x27;s a great shampoo too, and it makes my hair look and feel great. Ultrax Labs Hair Surge with Caffeine is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> My roommate tried it and she&#x27;s happy about it! No more hair loss and the hair looks healthier. I really recommend it! 100/100</li>
    <li> This is my second review about this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;Since day one, I had baby fine hair, &amp; not that much to begin with! When I started High School, my hair started to fall out! For years, I suffered because I had little hair, &amp; was practically bold in some areas! This shampo seems to be helping! My hair stylist noticed it, right away! My pathetic hair actually looks better! I will never have Lady Godiva hair, but I NO longer look like Yul Brinner! My advice: Buy It! IF it helps you, at least some, it will make you feel better! Having nice hair, is VERY important to looking good, &amp; feeling good! WE can ALL need, a little help! Right???😃🐶👍🏻</li>
    <li> I am a young female who has always had very fine hair, I noticed my hair thinning more and falling out more. I saw this product and read a lot of great reviews so decided to give it a try. The shampoo has a nice scent, makes my scalp feel really fresh and a bit tingly, and I noticed my hair falling out less and less. I have not been using the shampoo long, but the hair I already have feels thicker and much healthier already. I look forward to achieving even greater results with more use. I definitely recommend it to any male OR female that has thinning or fine hair. It is worth the price, much better than other products I have tried in the past! :)</li>
    <li> There is a reason this shampoo was rated 2015&#x27;s top shampoo for hair regrowth stimulation, because it actually works. Created for both men and women this product helps strengthen and thicken already present hair while stimulating the growth of new hair.&lt;br /&gt;It contains three powerful ingredients: Caffeine, ketoconazole, and. The caffeine helps extend the life cycle of the hair follicles, ketoconazole which is the same anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal ingredient in dandruff keeps hair healthy, and Saw Palmetto which turns testosterone into DHT, a major cause for male and female baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no magical product that will make your hair stronger and more full overnight, but with directed use this will give you those results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a week now... I absolutely love it... I have been using the shampoo as suggested (5days a week) Usually after showering I shed like crazy when I brush my hair. Since using Ultras Labs Hair Surge shampoo I have noticed that my hair is shedding less and less. The shampoo is mentholated and minty so it gives you that invigorating feeling after every wash.</li>
    <li> This product is both revolutionary and nothing short of incredible. Ultrax is the only brand that I allow on my hair now, it&#x27;s effective and will change the way you view yourself in an overwhelmingly positive way. It is a great investment in not only your self image, but also a great product to tell your friends/family about. I have only great things to say about the work that Ultrax Labs do, after using their products just once you will begin to realize that they have no comparison. I can&#x27;t imagine life without their products on my shelf.</li>
    <li> Siiiiggghh.... well I tried it... didn&#x27;t work.  Guess im stuck like chuck.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have used a number of products that make the claims of hair regrowth and thicker and more health hair. This is the first one that delivers on all three. I am impressed and very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the REAL deal.This is for people who will use it repeatedly and give it a chance to work. 1st time using you can feel the difference.and appreciate the science of the product. BUY with confidence, expect shipment to come quickly as seller uses Prime.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because if the reviews. Personally, I have not noticed any difference. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather like a shampoo should. Very difficult getting my hair washed and brushed afterwards. Definitely won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This one is very promising product. I am hoping that this one works well with me. I have been using commercially famous shampoo that strengthen and prevent loss of hair but all failed me. So this is the famous caffeine blend shampoo that reduce hair loss, stimulate hair growth and block effects of testosterone within the skin. I hope it doesn&#x27;t smell funny. I am really excited to try this one and try it myself. I&#x27;m hoping it can solve my dandruff issues to since it has Ketoconazole that blocks enzymes that creates dandruff. This one I guess is very convenient to use too.</li>
    <li> This product is not good.</li>
    <li> I believe this product is actually working for me.</li>
    <li> used this product before,  hard to find it in my small town but i found it,  so excited for this to get back in my hands</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week and I absolutely love it! I have always suffered from hair loss, I am only 20 years old and my hair has always been thin and dry, I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products and nothing has worked like this shampoo. I started seeing results within the first two days of using it. My hair is shiny and soft and I do not need to blow dry it or do much to it to give it volume and shape. I still straight it but it does not look dry anymore since I started using this shampoo. It truly is an amazing product. Try it yourself, you will NOT regret it!!.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice. It is so easy to use and the product does the work for you. I was totally satisfied with the product. I would definitely recommend the product if you desire hair growth! It makes your hair much thicker with a full look. Great product!</li>
    <li> Overpriced and very small bottle. You have to use a lot to get a lather and for the cost, it isn&#x27;t going to last long at all.</li>
    <li> I use this more regularly.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, adds more body to hair.  Holds in weather in Hawaii and the mainland.  Went on vacation in Las Vegas and Arizona, packed this shampoo and love it.</li>
    <li> I dont see any improvement, I am not sure how this is supposed to improve hair growth to be honest. I wasted my money on this. I followed the instructions, washed hair 5 times a week, and nothing happened. I wonder if you need several bottles before you see any actual change. I suggest to anyone who wants to purchase this, to do some research on their concept of caffeine infused shampoo to see if the results are legitimate. Unfortunately there isnt enough research to totally prove this theory of caffeine. Maybe It works for others but as for me, it didnt help. Also there are cheaper products with the same ingredients, check it out.</li>
    <li> appears to be a quality product, but it is to early to tell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the last 2 months and It is definitely my new permanent shampoo. I&#x27;ve been trying many over the last couple years and the positive results are the most noticeable, by far. My hair is much fuller and looks the best it has in years. Much less hair in the drain and comb, as well. My girlfriend loves it now too;) Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This shampoo did exactly as it said...improved the quality of my hair.  I could feel the difference in texture as soon as I lathered it in.  Once it came time to comb my hair, it was very easy with no tangling.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about this shampoo is the smell -- it&#x27;s a little on the strong side.  But, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair after it has been rinsed and conditioned.  Great pump bottle also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old extremely healthy female and at this age and the health level that I&#x27;m at, I never thought I&#x27;d have hair loss issues. I compete in fitness competitions and shows and for a show in March, I decided to get hair extensions glued in my hair so I could look great on stage! I kept the extensions in for months and when I got sick of it, I got them out, but was mortified to see how much hair I lost along with it! I was desperate and searched for the best hair growth shampoo. (Because I compete in competitions, I didn&#x27;t want to take any pills.) I&#x27;m very weary of fake reviews, but I gave Ultrax a try. The price was way above what I wanted to pay, but my hair was more important so I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product May 15th and today is June 15th so it lasted me exactly a month. It says to use at least 5 days a week, but I was desperate so I used it daily for 1 month. I have seen great results! After just 2 weeks. I&#x27;d get out of the shower, put my hand on my forehead and run my hand backward on my head and see baby hairs pop up! I even showed my fiance and he noticed it too! 2 weeks after that (so a month now) tose baby hairs have significantly grown and my hair looks a little awkward now as those new hairs are growing in and it&#x27;s different lengths than my old hair. But it&#x27;s long now like I have bangs almost. So the hair is definitely growing and visible where my hairline is and I&#x27;m very excited! I can&#x27;t tell though if it&#x27;s growing on other areas of my head since it&#x27;s not as visible. Shedding has also slowed down significantly! I don&#x27;t think my hair is thicker, but I don&#x27;t think it can make my old hair thicker, I think it&#x27;ll just get thicker once all my new hair grows in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t lather well at all. So I just use a small amount on my scalp area and leave it in for 2 min at least and then when I wash it out, I make sure to get it on the rest of my hair. I love lathering my hair so I&#x27;m bummed about that. The smell is ok; it doesn&#x27;t bother me and it doesn&#x27;t linger all day like my Neutrogena daily clarifying shampoo that I used to use before I had the hair loss issue. Honestly, I love this product and I just bought another bottle today and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after another month of use. I plan to continue using it even after my hair grows in but not as much because it IS pricey. I highly recommend it cause it works for me; at least buy it 1 time and use it religiously for 1 month and see if it works for you first. Good luck!I&#x27;m bummed about that.

    <li> So many products now days claim so much and provide so little.  Not with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived a day before it was expected (love that!).  After only three hair washes I already&lt;br /&gt;am noticing less hair in my brush.  I can only imagine the hair growth I am going to receive using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful and a little goes a long way. Ultrax Labs, you have a winner with your Hair Surge!</li>
    <li> Revitalizing, restructure, and renew is all what gives Hair Surge a “regrowth” for your hair. The stimulating title really defines the intense almost vibrating sensation on the head where the hair is thin or bald. It really enhances the thickness of your hair after even the first use, making it resourceful for people who are going bald or with thin hair. The caffeine infused shampoo helps restrengthen the hair follicles without leaving the greasy feeling on your head after its dried. For someone who deals with thin hair, this Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo makes for a comfortable way to renew your hair, giving it a whole new feel. I like this product as it helps my thin hair and helps cure the negative thinking that I might go bald or my hair might get even thinner. I highly recommend this product to people who want a preventative way of regaining a &amp;#34;new head of hair&amp;#34; feeling. Although this $50 product seems steep just for shampoo, minimal use for each application makes the price justifiable to buy. For better results, follow the recommended five times per week application method.</li>
    <li> It started with a broken hot water heater and a few showers at my friends house!!! It was by random chance that the friend who let me take showers at their house also had this product in the bathroom.I used the product 3 times and my hair was noticeably different. It was starting to show signs of hair on the tinniest part of my hair. I was excited so I bought the product myself. I&#x27;m so happy that my hot water heater broke!!</li>
    <li> This product feels very nice and soft on my hair. It does not feel damaging at all! After only two uses I&#x27;m noticing that hair patches where my hair is very thin is already starting to feel fuller. For $50 this product is set at a great price! Around my town there are places who offer these services for much higher prices. Definitely would try this product before paying hundreds on others! 10/10</li>
    <li> This product works very well because I had a noticeable difference to the thickness and vitality of my hair. I used this as a shampoo to my scalp and thouroughly massaged it in and left it there for two minutes each time for about a week now and I sweat alot because I work out alot so I take at least two hot showers a day and this stuff didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dried out at all in fact it felt like it stimulated the roots and the insides of my hair folicles making my scalp and all the hair on my end kind of stand up on end because they got this rush of nutrients. This shampoo was made in a laboratory and I can tell because it has a very unique and intense effect when I used it that most shampoos do not do in that I could actually feel and tell a difference within a few days in fact the first time I used it I said to myself &amp;#34;oh yeah this is one of those groovy shampoos that give you a very mild tingling sensation and I like intense tingling sensations more than mild ones but thats besides the point the effect of using it is quite extraordinary in that its like suddenly something happened to my hair on a chemical level and its invigorated and growing faster. I am very impressed by this and it was cool to squeeze out the clear light yellow honey colored liquid and see it promise on results based on it being made in lab with great scientific attention to its chemical composition. The only reason I would give it like 4.75 stars is because it didn&#x27;t have the greatest scent to it initially but that doesn&#x27;t really matter because it rinsed out leaving no scent at all which is also something I attribute to its purity on a nutrient level. I felt like my hair was very clean after using this and that it didn&#x27;t harm my hair it actually made it go kinda hyper which was cool and it says it has caffeine in it so hopefully I absorbed some of it along with the other stimulating ingredients in it and I will stop aging now altogether but so far so good.  I didn&#x27;t really mind this thing where it doesn&#x27;t have as nice of a smell to it as it could have so I am going to give it five stars. I would totally recommend this to anyone because after using it my scalp felt soothed and my hair had a noticeable glow to it from the high quality ingredients this shampoo is made with and it struck me as being fun to use with my significant other and an awesome idea for a stocking stuffer because of the cool packaging and label.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My hair is much healthier and thicker since using this shampoo. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I always see ads about hair repair shampoo and i don&#x27;t trust them. But yhdi time i tried this was so surprising it was soft and gave my hair the feeling of freshness. I felt so good about the freshness it brings. And the best part is that it smells very good. Looove it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any bald spots or anything, but every time I brush my hair, run my hands through it, or take a shower - it seems like handfuls of hair come out. I decided to try this shampoo out to see if I could slow down the hair loss before I DO get bald spots! I don&#x27;t love the smell. But after two weeks of using it, I&#x27;m definitely noticing less hair falling out/shedding. I just follow up with a better smelling conditioner and my hair smells fine after I shower. I wash my hair daily, and it looks and feels clean and shiny, too.</li>
    <li> This product is quite different from what I&#x27;ve used in the past. My friends have had great success with this product, and I decided to give it a try. It seems to be working well. I&#x27;ve witnessed less shedding, which is comforting. It will take more time for there to be hair growth (and if that even comes about), but halting the loss is half the battle!</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo.  I bought this to help reduce the amount of shedding with my long hair, and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed an improvement.  As a bonus, my hair is feeling thicker than ever after only a few weeks&#x27; use.  I debated about taking a chance on trying it out, and now very glad I did.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo.  My hair was much fuller, even after the first wash. My favorite thing though is how it tingles when you lather. Because of the caffeine it really wakes you up in the morning and, I hate how my this sounds like a commercial, but, it is invigorating. I gave this shampoo to my mom too, who has thinning hair and I&#x27;ve only heard positive things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I definitely am one of those people with flat, limp hair, and this made a pretty big difference--I used a pretty thick conditioner too, because I also have dry hair and it still made a big difference, but if you don&#x27;t, then this product would make your hair have even more volume.</li>
    <li> Since using this product my hair has become more voluminous and full. The product has a pleasant citrus smell and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.  Normally when I wash my hair I have lots of hair fall out, I have had a huge improvement with this after only a weeks or so.  After only a few washes I was able to notice an improvement in the fullness of my hair, and overall has helped with a reduction of hair loss.</li>
    <li> I think the product is a little pricey, but&lt;br /&gt;I am not losing as much hair as before&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product.</li>
    <li> There was no different in my hair,  and it smells like dish soap,  I won&#x27;t buy a second bottle</li>
    <li> Great addition to the conditioner I have from Ultrax, what can I say this brand knows it&#x27;s stuff. Straightforward packaging , convenient pump, awesome smell and most importantly does its job! Recommend this to those with thinning hair, it does the trick with adding more volume, I feel and see the results :) 👍</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great shampoo, and I believe it is working at thickening my hair.</li>
    <li> So far this product seems to be working great. After a few days, maybe a week, I noticed my problem areas stopped getting worse, which was such a relief. After another few days, I&#x27;m seeing the hair actually growing back in! I would definitely recommend this shampoo to my friends and family. I am so glad I found a product that really works. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using Ultrax Labs product for sometime, generally twice a week. I’ve seen improvements in hair growth. My hairstylist feels my hair is fuller and has more body.</li>
    <li> Nicely scented citrus smell shampoo. Looking forward to using.</li>
    <li> I suppose I associate some sort of scalp sensation with an effective shampoo hair treatment, but there is none when applied. Plus the shampoo does not foam (suds) when used. Not finished with the first bottle yet so can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> The only thing i could say IT IS AMAZING it really works my hair has more volumm and it has stop from falling ...and you can tell within the first couple of days... going on my second bottle.... thank you ULTRAX LAB HAIR SURGE</li>
    <li> I must admit I was skeptical when I first received the shampoo. Others have said it added inches to the hair and helped with major hair growth. I also get weary when it comes to chemicals that are supposed to &#x27;stimulate hair growth&#x27; simply because I don&#x27;t fully know what could be seeping into my scalp, BUT I will say that this product is safe and after couple uses I DID notice my hair was getting longer and noticeably thicker. I will also say I did notice that my hair doesn&#x27;t break or shed like it used to, so thats a plus as well!! For best results I&#x27;d say use the shampoo for a whole month to really start seeing and feeling a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well, very pleasant smell, not sure if I have noticed any hair growth yet (it&#x27;s been only few weeks). However, definitely noticed less hair falling. One thing I am not sure: is it habit forming? What I mean is will my hair go back to being brittle, thinning , falling a lot , and dull when I stop using it? Price is certainly an issue for a long term use.</li>
    <li> I have had great success with this company&#x27;s products to deal with hair loss so I decided to give their shampoo a try. I only shampoo my hair every other day so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be able to see the benefits of the shampoo that quickly, but boy was I wrong! When brushing my hair after a shower (when wet and then when dry) I noticed less hair falling out when I brush. After a few weeks of noticing less hair loss I then noticed how thick my hair actually felt. Not only was the hair count higher, but the hair strands themselves appeared thicker as well (at least the newer hair did). My hair seems more voluminous and I love how fast this product actually works! In reading about the ingredients and the effects they have I was excited to wash my hair!  Try it for yourself, you wont be disappointed! I would recommend this product to anyone that has had previous hair extensions, anyone with a lot of hair follicle damage (hair color/box dye/using a lot of hair products like hairspray) or anyone with thinning hair really. It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, helps with strengthening your hair, making it thicker and reduces hair shedding while leaving the scalp feeling great with a nice tingle.</li>
    <li> I purchased Hair Surge in order to prevent my thinning hair from getting worse. I have used it for about a week now and can state that it has improved the quality of my hair by making it fuller and less prone to breaking off in my comb. I do not see as much hair in my comb after my morning comb through and my hair feels thicker and healthier. This product works. It is a bit pricey but it does the job as I approach the twilight of my beautiful head of hair!</li>
    <li> For a long time, I searched for shampoo that would help with my shedding problems and would offer me great looking hair. A friend of mind suggested that I try Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo. I&#x27;m really particular about my hair, so I was hesitant to trust my hair to just any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One sign of a great shampoo is low lather, mild scent and great results, all which are in this shampoo. After reading some of the reviews of other customers, I&#x27;m impressed and sold.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a week and followed the instructions.. My hair is short on my sides so I always notice when my gets longer and have naturally soft hair.... I honestly have to say I&#x27;m not sure if this made any difference at all. Maybe it has or maybe over time it will work better but right now I&#x27;m just not convinced.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo after buying the conditioner because I had found that it worked well. This stuff is GREAT. Smells wonderful, works well, and leaves your hair feeling fresh in the short term. In the long term, this shampoo helps reduce hair shedding and loss. Love this stuff, swear by it!</li>
    <li> I have used the product 3x times so far (once a week) and I am gradually seeing less shedding and breakage and as well the thin weak spots of my hair is getting thicker.  There are definitely enough results to make me want to continue using the product. Also, to be completely transparent I have included Tropics Jamaican Black Castor oil with coconut oil to my hair regimen.  The combination of the shampoo and the oils seem to be completely complimenting each other. It is great feeling to comb my hair and not have a small ball of hair in my comb for a change.  This product is also educating me on the positive effects of caffeine when it is dosed and used properly.  It can be very good for the skin and the body.</li>
    <li> I bought this expensive shampoo after being convinced by all the positive reviews. I&#x27;m sure you are being influenced by the high rating as well. I can&#x27;t claim that it doesn&#x27;t work period, as for some people it apparently does, but it didn&#x27;t work at for me. I used this as directed for 5 months and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my balding. Shedding was never my problem, just thinning. This had no effect for me personally, so just be forewarned that many of these 5 star ratings are certainly fake.</li>
    <li> Really?  How could I have fallen for this nonsense.  If it worked, wouldnt everyone just do this and be done with MPB?  Sadly, you will get ripped off if you buy this.  The high price insinuates the product has some viability - nope.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend this product at all it did not work at all and it did not even lather either it is the  worst shampoo I have ever used</li>
    <li> This product does everything it says! grandfather loved it! Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Great and amazing product! I love it and will definitely be reordering this. It did give my hair great volume and thickness that i needed and my hair texture was nice and soft and had shine to it. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Firstly, I NEVER write reviews.  I received the shampoo yesterday and used it for the FIRST time this morning... while my hair was a little more difficult to comb through when I got out of the shower (I also didn&#x27;t use any conditioner except for on the bitty ends), I lost less hair and it felt and looked WAY fuller after I dried it. Now that&#x27;s its about 3:30 PM, my hair has gotten a little flatter but still feels a little fuller to the touch.  I&#x27;ve always been a person to only wash my hair 2 or 3 times a week because 1) I color it and 2) it&#x27;s supposedly healthier for the hair.  This shampoo suggests washing 5x per week and I WILL! especially if these benefits keep happening.  and the thought of new growth makes me feel so excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will provide an update after a week or two!</li>
    <li> Dried my hair out. My hairdresser told me to stop using it as it was damaging my hair. Once I stopped it took one month for my hair to feel healthy again. No new hair growth</li>
    <li> I got this for my brother and he LOVED it. It worked instantly! His hair became thicker and more lush. The key word? Be patient.</li>
    <li> You should read the ingredients. It&#x27;s horrible if you want a good shampoo get something else like Nizrol. Just read the ingredients before purchasing this product...you&#x27;ll know exactly why you shouldn&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s got everything a healthy shampoo shouldn&#x27;t have</li>
    <li> It seems like a decent shampoo but I&#x27;ve been using two of these and haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth at all and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel any stronger. Seems like you are just getting a good shampoo just with invalid claims to overprice it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item and so far I have not noticed anything significant about this shampoo. I think I&#x27;ve had this shampoo now for 3 weeks. Before I purchased it, I read the reviews and got myself excited about it but so far I&#x27;m pretty disappointed I spent the money for it. The shampoo stinks and there is no tingle like some of the reviews stated. I use the shampoo every day since I&#x27;m in the habit of washing my hair daily. I&#x27;ll use it until it runs out and then write another review if I see any changes in my hair.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this new Ultrax product. My Hair feels stronger and healthier than ever. I barely see any more dandruff. My edges have thinned out because of wearing too much weave, But I see them getting fuller and growing back in just a few weeks of using the Ultrax. The caffeine must have something to do with it. I can&#x27;t wait to see how great my hair looks after a year.</li>
    <li> This product works great, just when you thought you were gonna lose it all, Ultrax Labs comes in and saves the day, it adds life back to your hair and helps it thicken up to where you can actually style it again, have thinning hair then you need this product, it really helps and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it, better than most other products on the market!!</li>
    <li> Just another really expensive shampoo but to be fair ive only been using it for a month.</li>
    <li> This product works best when paired with the conditioner, but still can stand alone as a hair retention shampoo. It has a pleasant smell and has a light feel to it. The trick is to use the product as consistently as the bottle says to and then wait for results. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so depending on the user&#x27;s specific problem, the shampoo will act differently. I will say that if the reason your hair is breaking is due to heat damage, relaxer damage, or color damage, this product should work to strengthen the damaged cuticles of hair and provide thickness. I have been using this product on over-processed, heat damaged hair and I am already detecting a livelier shine than usual.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and was pretty amazed at the volume of my hair after using this shampoo.  My hair was thicker after one use.  I had also been having problems with pores getting clogged on my scalp and they were eliminated when I used this stimulating shampoo. Very impressed with this product!</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to try this shampoo due to the high cost, but I ordered it at $29.99 a little over a month ago. Here are my pros and cons. PRO: High shine, reduces hair fall out, hair feels very clean and soft - CONS: Does not later well. I have short to medium length hair and it takes about 6-8 pumps to produce a normal amount of lather, no signs of thickening hair or new hair growth and last but not least, the increasingly high cost! The cost has since gone up to $43.99! and I will not purchase it again at this price, I would really need to see a drastic improvement in hair growth to justifiy a price of $43.99 or more! Just my two cents! :)</li>
    <li> First day I used it my wife said my hair looked thick. First round doesnt lather much, youll have to apply another round to get the sudzy feel.</li>
    <li> Caffeine as a hair stimulant, why not? Thought I&#x27;d give this a try, as some hair thinning up front. So far so good. Smells Great and my hair is soft. I noticed a slight thickening after one use and it continues! There isn&#x27;t much lather with this shampoo but I like that there is a slight tingle on your scalp when you shampoo, you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Very effective. My hair looks and feels fuller and thicker. I saw hair growth the first week I started using it. I&#x27;ve received compliments on how nice my hair looks now. It has a fresh scent. Easy to apply. Well worth the money. High quality product</li>
    <li> Received my product quickly. I had never heard off it before and decided to give it a try. I went thru a lot a stress this year and my hair have unfortunately paid the price it is thinning on top of my head (stress area). After taking steps to be healthier I included this shampoo to my routine and noticed a great improvement on the quality of my hair it is all over stronger, I have less breakage and the hair on my stress spot is definitely not as dry and more manageable, and I am happy to notice that my stress area have shrunk which is all I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The scent it not bad and it does lather well.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am not sure yet about whether or not this product is encouraging my hair growth, but it does contain two main ingredients: caffeine and ketoconazole, touted to provide such effect. So we shall see on that front. I got it because ketoconazole also helps to treat dandruff, which I sometimes suffer from, so I figured \\&quot;why not\\&quot; give it a try. What I like most about it is the boost it gives my morning shower due to menthol, which leaves my scalp with a slight tingling feeling. The scent is invigorating for waking up the senses and hey, might as well have the caffeine on the outside as well as the inside!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Nice citrus-ginger scent...the wife loves it.  Hair has improved drastically!  Would give 6 stars if I could!!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge is a must buy product for those with hair loss challenges. I am excited that the product has a pleasant scent unlike most hair growth shampoos. My thinning hair is already looking fuller after 12 days of usage. You can’t go wrong with a made in the USA product that offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> I have tried several shampoos&#x27;, and leave in conditioner to stop my hair from thinning around my temples. They all left my hair feeling heavy and my scalp caked with product. After using Ultrax&#x27;s hair loss shampoo I immediately noticed how fresh and awake my scalp felt. The first week I did not notice any growth, but my shower drain finally didn&#x27;t get clogged with hair!  After using the shampoo for about 2-3 months my edges came back .I think that this really works,  I still use this shampoo to help my hair grow longer and fuller. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am shocked! I would have gladly settled for LESS HAIR LOSS and been perfectly happy with that. Not only has that happened, but I can see that my hair is actually beginning to fill in...I have two very distinct spots that are very visible, and unbelievably, there is new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I thought I might be hallucinating, I asked my husband, and he confirmed it. He is so impressed that he is going to try it himself, as he is beginning to show signs of male pattern baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a short time, but I am encouraged with the results, so far. There isn&#x27;t an excessive amount of lather, which is fine with me, and there is absolutely NO medicinal smell, and that is a real bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the price is not an issue...I have paid hundreds of dollars for products over the years, consulted dermatologists and cosmetologists without much success. I would pay twice the price for this product, because IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some might think its superficial and vain to be so concerned about one&#x27;s hair, but unless you have struggled with this problem, you have no idea how wonderful it is to have found something that actually fulfills it&#x27;s promise!</li>
    <li> I could not be more impressed and pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve had a mild case of thinning hair for some time and have tried many other shampoos but none of them really helped.  After using this for less than two weeks, I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic improvement.  Not only has my hair stopped shedding but there&#x27;s a noticeable thickening of my hair.  I love the silky, exquisite way this makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> My hair is gray, dry, frizzy, a little on the thin side; used this product for 3 1/2 weeks. It made my hair drier, fly-away, real annoying.  I only used it 3 times a week because of said dry hair, which became worse.  I threw it away (not the hair, the shampoo).  Looking into making homemade shampoo.</li>
    <li> It seems to make your hair look fuller but I don&#x27;t know if your hair actually grows?</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my dad, who is nearly completely bald on top.  He was looking for something to at least stop the loss of his hair before he ended up with just the ring o&#x27;hair that a lot of older men have.  So far, he&#x27;s thrilled with the results.  He says he&#x27;s noticed a significant reduction in the amount of hair he loses in the morning and isn&#x27;t seeing the lost hair on his pillow from overnight, either.  He seems to be pleased with the scent of the shampoo and is using it the recommended number of times, as he is an exacting customer.  So far, the hair loss has greatly diminished and after just a few weeks, he does see some new growth beginning.  He is a satisfied customer and says his hair feels better after using this shampoo - softer and easier to control than before.</li>
    <li> Using this product before, after a couple weeks you do start seeing results. It&#x27;s effective as you start seeing hair growing back and the decreasing rate of hair loss. Follow the instructions and used as instructed, and it will work! Great value for the product</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really great. I have hair that likes to shed, and have noticed significantly less hair breakage since using this product. It lathers up really nicely, and leaves a tingly sensation while washing it. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of the ingredients, but I noticed that in contains Ketoconazole, which apparently helps fight dandruff. Always a plus, cause I do have a bit of a dry scalp. After using it my hair is nice and soft, and smells a bit minty, (It  contains mango butter, and peppermint) which is ok and different than most shampoos I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a pump which is great to sit in the shower caddy and kind of just ready to use, since you have to wash often to see any results as far as hair growth goes. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I read all of the comments and thought the product was a &amp;quot;can&#x27;t miss&amp;quot;.  I mean, how many 5-star ratings can a product actually get?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used the product daily and 2 months later there is no new hair growth, and I am still shedding at the same rate.  All this product appears to do is delay you from finding a solution that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 of my friends also bought this at the same time as I did, and all 3 had the same results that I did.  We are now laughing together about our naivet&amp;eacute; and trust.  Ultrax Labs, we will await our refund from the class action lawsuit that will be filed against you.</li>
    <li> Great product I feel the product working already such a amazing item its worth every penny. This is the most wonderful shampoo I ever purchase.</li>
    <li> You can definitely feel it tingling as it works! Both my husband and I use it and it has worked for both of us! My shedding stopped and his hair is coming back thicker than with any other product! Fresh citrus-y smell too! Super fast shipping! Received the product within days! Will definitely purchase again! A ++!!</li>
    <li> Just got my second bottle. Definitely saw an improvement in thickness and volume, and I dont want that to go away any time soon. Even my girlfriend has noticed an improvement in my hair. Feeling pretty confident now so I might actually let my hair grow out some more. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo. Not only is my hair growing faster but it&#x27;s also getting thicker. I use to wash my hair and find hair in the drain after, but now I&#x27;m not losing hair at all. The shampoo even smells great, especially after I blow dry. So glad I found this shampoo!</li>
    <li> For starters, delivery is fast, which I always appreciate.  Secondly, the smell is fantastic!  To my absolute amazemen, after about a week&#x27;s use, I already see new hair growth stubble.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> It looks awesome it shipped pretty fast. It was due on oct 25 th I got a day earlier.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I just started using it and I love it already! My hair constantly falls out and I&#x27;ve noticed less hair falling out since I started using it. I would definitely recommend this product to other people.</li>
    <li> Let me start the review by saying how fast the delivery for this was. Amazed it took two days to get to my home. I ordered from Beauty superstore plus it came in very secure packaging by the way so the bottle had no dents or anything what so ever. Now on to the product itself, let me start by saying it has interesting sensation on your scalp. Not in a bad way somewhere along the lines of refreshing and tingling. The effectiveness is amazing so far I have been using it for two days and I can tell that there is improvement on a small bald spot I have. It also leaves the scalp feeling amazingly clean, in all seriousness I have never used a hair product that had so much effectiveness. I highly recommend it if you have scalp issues, hair loss problems, small bald spots,or want thick hair.</li>
    <li> After only a few uses I can feel a difference in my hair.  I also see less hair in my hair brush.  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for five days now and I do really think it makes hair thicker. What I really loved about it thou&lt;br /&gt;is how incredibly shining it makes your hair. I also do not like strong smelling products with lots of perfume: this is almost odorless.&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight  henna smell to it which is a natural product that is really great for your hair.</li>
    <li> I already wrote one review of this shampoo, but I wanted to add some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I stated before I was a little cautious about using this product, due to the cost, but a friend highly recommended it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used it, I was loosing hair by the handful and was very concerned. Now I am really seeing less hair loss and more volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I love that it is natural not harsh on my hair coloring.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been losing my hair since I was about 15 years old, and I&#x27;ve tried different things, laser hair therapy etc. But nothing showed results. I tried this on a whim and I have to say, it has really stopped me from losing any more and it could be my imagination but it feels like new hair may be beginning to grow. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but I&#x27;m definitely pleased. For the first time in a long time in the spot (it&#x27;s a big one) where I&#x27;ve lost most of my hair. The stuff may seem pricy, but it works. And based on the other reviews I&#x27;m not the only one who has seen results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys who have lost hair are a desparate bunch, and I am part of that category, so I am happy to say I&#x27;ve found something that has helped for the first time!</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo along with the conditioner and it does work but it&#x27;s just not worth the price at all because the bottle is tiny. I thought 44$ for shampoo was a lot of money when I was picturing a normal sized bottle but DEFINITELY way too much money for this little product. And on top of that it goes so fast because you have to use more than regular shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t lather like normal. If your hair is even a little long this won&#x27;t last you half of a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line if you have a lot of extra money to throw around, go for it but this is definitely a rip off for this Barbie size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(p.s. a nice inexpensive way to help with hair loss and to help grow hair is organic virgin coconut oil head massages a few times a week. i started doing this a year ago and my hair went from my bra strap length to past my butt with a lot less shedding. google it see all the natural benefits, hope it helps!)</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes of filling out my hairline or &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34;. After many years of slicking back my hair in a ponytail I noticed some pretty drastic thinning around my hairline. Im on my second bottle of shampoo and have noticed great improvements. My hairline has filled in quite a bit. When i first starting using it I was a little surprised by the tingling but I&#x27;m sure thats only stimulating my scalp. My hair is also much thicker.  It has a mild citrus smell which goes away once you use conditioner. Excited to see what new growth comes with my second bottle. like with anything it takes patience, persistence and consistency but so far its been totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a month, and I haven&#x27;t seen results.  Still hopeful!</li>
    <li> This Is Awesome !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M 45 Years Old With Early Signs Of Hair Loss From My Thyroid Condition And Hair Surge Made My Hair Thick And Full. And I Love It. I Saw Results Right Away. And I Would Recommend Hair Surge To Any One Looking To Repair Thin Limp Hair, And Hair Loss. This Is A Very good Stimulating Shampoo !</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I have to say I was a bit hesitant to believe that it worked so well but it has really impressed me the longer I have used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dabbled with a few hair stimulating products over the last few years ever since I noticed some thinning at the end of my 20s/beginning of my 30s.  I bought some cheaper products and it was no surprise that I did not see results.  This was the first &#x27;higher end&#x27; product I have purchased and I am very happy I did.  I started using it almost a month ago and use it about 3-5 times a week.  The first week I noticed nothing.  The second week I thought I felt some baby hairs coming in but thought my imagination may have been getting the best of me.  The third week I really noticed results.  My thinness on the top of my head and back by the &#x27;bald spot&#x27; are noticeably thicker.  I can tell when I run my fingers through my hair or use a hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than satisfied with this product and will be purchasing more when I run out.  I will also post a future review if it stops working or I see any different results.  Cheers!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite impressed with the ingredients that this product has, and how it would go out working. To directly apply, even little amounts of, these ingredients to your scalp, I could imagine making such a difference. I&#x27;ve never known caffeine to be a helper for hair growth, and to know now, seems intriguing. I&#x27;ve enjoyed the use of dandruff shampoos, for how they affected my hair after months of using the product. To find that these shampoos, have similar qualities, such as, ketoconazole, makes this product much more appealing. I&#x27;ve seen how that has been on my hair before, and I have been quite satisfied. Now also, for a product to also have Saw Palmetto, pretty much, a natural enzyme that blocks DHT, which is known to cause baldness. Knowing that this product can make hair grow faster, stronger, and help prevent baldness to its ability, shows that its a quality product for the user.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product a little over a week ago, already starting to see my hair grow longer, however I do use other natural hair growing shampoos with it and previously detoxed from chemical soaps and shampoos. So far so good with this product though, smells really good too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the past 3 months, but it&#x27;s not helping me to grow new hair.</li>
    <li> I used for 8 months and the only thing it did was cause shedding (no regrowth). Definitely not worth the price and I agree the reviews here must be fake.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has a pleasant smell, not overly fragrant.  It comes in a slow-pump bottle designed to prevent too much shampoo dispersing at once.  The serum is clear in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, apply a generous amount to your hair, paying special attention to your scalp.  This is very simple to apply.  Massage shampoo in as best as possible, and leave on for about 5 minutes.  Then be sure to rinse the solution thoroughly from your hair.  The shampoo does not create a rich, soapy lather, but feels more like a gel when applied to your hair.  Be sure to moisturize with conditioner or Argan oil afterward, it does slightly dry out your locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great and I noticed fuller, more bodied hair after using this for about a week or so.  I do not notice as much stray hairs falling out when I brush my hair.  I did not experience any negative effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Received sample for review.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is truly excellent. I have always had very thin hair and have tried many products to try to get the thick, fuller look I&#x27;ve always wanted. This includes using many sprays, hair drying techniques, shampoos, and conditioners. NONE of the other products I&#x27;ve used come close to this! It smells so nice and I can&#x27;t believe how long AND FULL my hair has gotten! I think for me the best part of this product (other than how well it works) is how easy it is use everyday as part of a normal routine. This is definitely a holy grail shampoo for anyone with thin hair!!!</li>
    <li> I have been working thinning hair since forever.  I have been using this product for 3 weeks and have noticed a decrease in the amount of hair I pull out of the drain.  I even see some new hair growth when I look in the mirror!!</li>
    <li> First a little about my hair to give you an idea of what this product was used for. I&#x27;m in my early 30s, female, hair thinning started a few years ago, no illnesses, just genetics. I decided to give this a try after trying a few other similar products. I went through 2 bottles of this shampoo (i used it with the conditioner every other day) and my existing hair got longer faster (which is why 2 stars instead of 1), but new hair in places that I needed it most did NOT grow back. Also the more I used this, the more shedding I noticed. Yesterday the shedding got so scary bad that i said F. it, threw out the remainder of the shampoo and ordered the shampoo that actually stopped my shedding before (pura D&#x27;or). I truly hope this works for someone, but for me it went horribly wrong.</li>
    <li> My hair has been shedding dramatically and thinning for a while now, I&#x27;ve used this for four days and have already seen a MAJOR reduction in the amount of shed hair. I&#x27;m very impressed since absolutely nothing has worked so quick to stop my hair from shedding! My hair feels clean without feeling stripped or dry after washing. And my hair felt so moisturized and easy to manage without even using any conditioner yet! It smells great too. Almost each and every ingredient has some benefit to combat hair loss and promote hair growth so I know this product is well worth it. I&#x27;m going to add this to my regimen and continue using this daily. Finally something has actually helped my hair troubles and I&#x27;m excited to see how well this is going to keep working!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! After just a few washes I could already see a difference in my hair. It&#x27;s thicker and I&#x27;ve noticed that I have less breakage. The shampoo has a nice, clean scent and leaves my hair shiny too. A must try if you&#x27;re looking to grow your hair!</li>
    <li> This product arrived like overnight!  After one wash what I really noticed is that my hair has extremely more lift from the roots!  It usually lays flat, especially around the cowlick in the back.  This shampoo makes it stick up somehow, and the horrible cowlick is so easy to style now, and it stays put! I don&#x27;t wash everyday and my hair still has lift on the third day!  The volume is fabulous.  I don&#x27;t know yet if it is growing but I was excited about these results and wanted to share them.  I have had new hair growing for several months now  since I&#x27;ve been on thyroid medication (I lost quite a bit of hair!). This shampoo root lifting effect, combined with the new growth I  have is very exciting, although I won&#x27;t know for sure how much the shampoo alone helped my growth.  Anyway, it looks like I have more hair that lasts for days, even through the rain, I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> I love this product! $50 for a shampoo seems expensive but this one is worth every penny. To put it simply: the results are amazing and way better than what I got with similar products or vitamins. I started using Ultrax 2 months ago when I started to have serious hair loss problems and decided to do something about it.  In less than 2 weeks, I could already tell the difference: my hair had a lot more volume, definition, better texture and length. Somehow, it seems that my hair is growing faster as well because I can see a lot more baby hair than usual. My hair is getting healthier and looking better and fuller everyday. I love that I am getting so many comments from the people who know me: it works! If you’re battling with hair loss like I was, do yourself a favor and use Ultrax: it’s the best product for your hair. As for me, I just wish I would have known about this product sooner.</li>
    <li> Like with a lot of products, this one in particular requires patience. I have super curly frizzy hair and so most people assume I have a lot of hair but that&#x27;s not the case. When my hair is straightened it&#x27;s only but a sad skinny ponytail. I shed a lot of hair (more than normal) and also had some bald spots near my hairline. I&#x27;ve definitely seen an improvement over the last couple of weeks with shedding and also see some of the bald spots filling in. I don&#x27;t know if the caffeine works like some magical ingredient but this stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that for some the price may be off-putting but when it&#x27;s your hair on the line you should spare no expense (to a certain limit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: the smell is not as pleasant but it doesn&#x27;t linger for long on MY hair.</li>
    <li> I had a couple of areas in my hairline that had receded over the last 5 years leaving 2 completely bare patches the size of a quarter.  I have tried several of the other shampoos that are marketed for hair regrowth- none of them had caffeine- with no regrowth at all.  I am happy to say that after 5 weeks of using this shampoo, those patches are completely filled in with new hairs that are now about an inch long.  This shampoo has a light pleasant scent.  It does not lather much nor does it make my hair soft.  However, I found that by using a scalp brush I could get a nice lather going and conditioner takes care of making my hair feel soft.  I use it every day and leave it on for 2-3 minutes.  I figure the scalp brush probably increases circulation to my scalp possibly enhancing uptake of the active ingredients.  It also feels great.  I use two pumps per shampoo and I figure this bottle should last at least 2 months.</li>
    <li> Five days in for this product, I have noticed a reduction in shedding and \\&quot;breakage\\&quot; in my hair. It&#x27;s crazy because I didn&#x27;t even know what breakage was before purchasing this product. I am not sure that the average person would notice the change, but I have and am elated! My girlfriend has noticed as well. I will update in the future!</li>
    <li> Makes hair soft! Too early to telll about hair growth, however.</li>
    <li> What a waste!  Over priced! No difference!  Used shampoo, conditioner, and serum for one month,  and nada!  I want my money back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hair Surge for a week and I can honestly say this stuff works.  My hair is noticeably thicker and appears to have more volume -- it even gets a bit puffy after I towel dry it.  The first 3 days I didn&#x27;t notice any changes, (except for the feeling during and after shampooing, which I will get to next) but after a full week of using Hair Surge at least once a day, my hair is thicker, feels more full to the touch, and looks healthy.  What I did notice immediately is the fresh, almost minty feeling on my scalp.  During each use, the silky, gel-like liquid smells a bit like peppermint and it doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as typical shampoos -- but you feel the minty, cooling effect on your scalp which lasts for a while even after you&#x27;re done...and I&#x27;ve noticed significantly less dandruff the past few days, which is surely not a coincidence. I highly recommend trying this product, after just 1 week my hair and scalp feel and look so much healthier.  I&#x27;m going to buy a bottle for my dad to see if his thinning hair can&#x27;t get a boost too.</li>
    <li> After using this product just a couple of times, My scalp feels really clean which is a new sensation to me. While rubbing the product in on each application. I could smell the scent of orange peel I think.  Which made me feel awakened in the morning. Need that! Unusually a very nice luxurious feeling with a lot of visual shine in my hair. Felt as if I had just had a very expensive conditioning treatment to my hair &amp; scalp. Great product!</li>
    <li> No doubt about it, this is the most effective hair growth shampoo on the market. Not only is it made in America, have a clean smell not laden with chemicals, and a great lather, but it absolutely WORKS! As a female with painstakingly slow-growing hair, I was desperate for something with quicker results than horse hair shampoo to help a horrendous haircut. Low and behold, this product truly exceeds the hype. One wash, and you literally feel the difference! My hair is fuller, shinier, and after a few washes, longer and even stronger feeling. Even my scalp feels healthier and more hydrated. I can honestly say I am grateful to this company for this product and ecstatic with the results!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge works. Doing any research online I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find caffeine HELPS with hair loss. No 2 people are alike though, so if it doesn&#x27;t work for you move along. Trail and error. In regards to MY thin hair, It has made a HUGE impact on the strength and thickness of my hair, Being patient is key. All in all I would totally recommend this product to all those who have dull, thin hair. 5 stars based on MY results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this shampoo is making my hair more strong. I am noticing less hair on the pillow and in the hairbrush when I brush my hair. So far my hair-fall is less and my hair isn&#x27;t breaking as much as it used to. I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo for thin, fine hair.  I really like it.  I used it before getting a perm and it kept my hair soft.  Do not use it every day.  My hair, like I said is fine and this shampoo makes it very soft, so I could not use it every day, my hair would be a fly away mess.  As for hair regrowth,  I don&#x27;t see that, but it is the right shampoo for my hair.</li>

Seriously that is what it has felt like - I have reversed my situation form loss of hair to now having a steady hair growth.

Hair Surge contains 0.2% Ketoconazole and has not harmed me in any way shape or form. Therefore this is a great product that should be purchased.</li>
    <li> Works great to make hair look great. Not sure about the hair loss part though. Could&#x27;ve been a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about a week and a half, and this shampoo seems to be working wonders!  It smells great, and it feels like my hair is already getting thicker and has less breakage and loss.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how much fuller my hair will be after a month of this stuff - I can probably safely say that I will be ordering another bottle asap!</li>
    <li> I am a woman over 50. During my last haircut, I noticed just how thin my hair had gotten on top. YIKES. I liked the sound of this shampoo because it is one product and not some drug. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for about three weeks, and not only does my hair smell great, if I look closely I can see new hair growth in the most spares areas. And considerably less hair in my hairbrush. I will update in a month or two and let you all know how it&#x27;s working, but so far I am thrilled to find such a simple solution to such an upsetting problem.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my boyfriend who, in his early 20&#x27;s, is already experiencing hair thinning. He&#x27;s only been using it for a few days, but his fair already seems thicker. It&#x27;s also made his hair softer and smoother. We&#x27;re excited to continue using this product. Plus, I love the fresh citrus-y smell! I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
    <li> Great product for almost every hair type. Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo is a really great product. After about only 3 uses, my hair already feels thicker and has more volume. The shampoo smells very good as well, its scent is reminiscent of citrus and flowers. When I lather it onto my head in the shower, I can feel a slight tingle that may be a result of the caffeine. Or it might just be in my head, but either way this is a great product. It delivers on its promises and I will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I would give this product ten stars if there were 5 more.</li>
    <li> My hair already feels thicker and it smells great. Usually with shampoos like this it stings my eyes and smells bad but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was able to get this product for my aunt who has been experiencing thinning hair and some hair loss due to thinning and breakage. It has only been one week since the shampoo came so I did not expect to have much to say other than the shampoo smells great and she commented on the “extra clean” feeling in her scalp. HOWEVER, I do have more to add as my uncle and I have already noticed the difference in her hair. It looks “fuller” already and the breakage seems to have stopped as we haven’t found pieces of her hair laying around on the furniture as we normally do. This has made a dramatic difference in not only her appearance but more importantly her confidence. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing hair loss.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipment. Love the scent of this and after one week on continuous use I feel like my hair is getting thicker! Im so excited to see the results after one month.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, this product does its job and does it well. I was very pleased with the purchase, and would recommend the product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love this Ultrax Labs Hair product!! My hair is so much thicker and healthier!</li>
    <li> If anybody has a problem with thinning hair you must give this a try. I did ! and it works ! My hair started thinning a year ago. I finally started using Ultrax Labs Hair Surge because my sister had incredible results with hair regrowth in just a month. I also had great results in just a month. I spent so much money on vitamins and supplements that did nothing for my hair so it was not a stretch to spend the price on this shampoo. So worth it. Nothing is as important to my appearance than my hair. And because of this &#x27;Wonder Shampoo&#x27;  my beautiful hair is coming back to it&#x27;s youth ! I&#x27;m so happy with this shampoo ! I love the tingly feeling and the fresh smell. One bottle lasted me a little more than a month. My bangs were the first part to get thicker and longer . Bobby pins no longer slipped out when I pulled my bangs back. such a great feeling.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo with absolutely no hopes - as I&#x27;ve tried many other similar products without any results. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for nearly 5 weeks now - and I can already see some of my bald patches disappearing and hair growing back thicker and fuller. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this product!!! After searching for a product that would help stop shedding I tried this out and I have been happy with my decision. Not only did it stop the shedding but the parts where my hair was thinning it filled in those spots and now I have a lot of new growth!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product. It makes my scalp feel refreshed. My hair is getting stronger. I have noticed less breakage and loss. It has a nice fragrance. My hair already feels fuller. You will not be disappointed with Ultrax Labs Hair Surge Caffeine Hair Loss Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Since using my first bottle, my hair has been more manageable, without having fly-away straggles around my ears, as most other shampoos did.  I remember feeling the difference after just one use. My hair felt somehow stronger and had more life in it. After 2 weeks of using it (which actually amounts to 6 uses, as with my dry hair I do not have a need for daily wash) I can see less shedding for sure. My brush doesn’t pick up so many “loose” hairs and the shower drain has WAAYYY less hair i shed from shampooing. It also has a light minty smell which is invigorating. Its an investment but well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? FOR SURE&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to my family and friends? OF COURSE. My mom is so excited and already ordered a bottle for herself.</li>
    <li> As with the conditioner, I don&#x27;t care for the confectionary-like smell at all and does NOTHING to arrest hair loss.  Total waste of money.  Save your cash for a hat. Or a wig.</li>
