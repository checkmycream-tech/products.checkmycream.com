      <li>Great primer for the price.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t test on animals, so that&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>non existing lol)</li>
      <li>Does its job good.</li>
      <li>I have good lashes.</li>
      <li>So I did just that, a good 1/2 hour before.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the seller, not the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I love ELF make up, been using this primer for awhile.</li>
      <li>I love the rest of their products.</li>
      <li>, what more could you ask from a primer?</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing more.  </li>
      <li>Sure, it lengthens, but</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>It works pretty good</li>
      <li>It seems to work best when the mascara is applied before the primer is fully dry.</li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  </li>
      <li>but that is fine</li>
      <li>Helped my mascara stay on without flaking and it works fantastic as a brow primer after you put on your eye brow pencil.</li>
      <li>this stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This mascara primer goes on smoothly and seems to works well in extending my lashes</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;m happy to report that its pretty good for very little money.</li>
      <li>Normally I&#x27;m nearly always thrilled at the beauty products I buy on amazon.  </li>
      <li>and the primer really does make a more thicker difference along the mascara.</li>
      <li>Works adequately, but not waterproof.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that I am able to use this primer and then a single coat of mascara</li>
      <li>I find that using a mascara primer (any kind) protects against lash fall-out and damage from daily mascara use.</li>
      <li>I need several coats to make any kind of difference.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother, it&#x27;s not like it cost very much, but it was a dissapointment.</li>
      <li>We don&#x27;t need to be tricked into thinking there&#x27;s more product than we&#x27;re actually getting, do we?  </li>
      <li>It makes my eyelashes look fuller in comparison to just using mascara without priming first.</li>
      <li>This product worked OK, but I didn&#x27;t notice enough of a difference when using it.  </li>
      <li>I formerly used a product from Lancôme that performed better than this</li>
      <li>I cannot say whether this product is any good becase the one I received was basically dried out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it works as good but for the price it&#x27;s really close!</li>
      <li>I really like this primer for the price</li>
      <li>It did not do much for my lashes in terms of appearance, but it made mascara a bit easier to apply--</li>
      <li>but this one doesn&#x27;t really do the job I hoped it would.</li>
      <li>After many different levels of application, I came to the conclusion that this simply doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
      <li>As someone who has very sensitive eyes, I really like this primer.  </li>
      <li>maybe this is true of all lash primers, but it is pretty stiff, meaning that any mascara I put on afterward looks clumpy.  </li>
      <li>but of course it was several dollars higher in price.</li>
      <li>and I end up with very natural and soft looking eyelashes.</li>
      <li>It also seems to last the whole day; I wore it to work</li>
      <li>it makes the mascara go on smoothly and very little clumping.</li>
      <li>It works great but is very expensive.  </li>
      <li>While following the instructions is important - waitng half an hour before applying mascara over it will most likely be the reason for clumps - it only takes a few seconds for it to dry.</li>
      <li>One of the benefits of using a clear primer is that your not layering on coat after coat of mascara to cover the white.  </li>
      <li>I havent seen this in the regular stores i frequent that carry elf products.  </li>
      <li>I tossed it and my lashes look better with the MAC false lash mascara alone.  </li>
      <li>I like them to look fuller and more dramatic.</li>
      <li>really not any more than any lengthening mascara, and if you went that route at least you wouldn&#x27;t have clumpy lashes.  </li>
      <li>I honestly only bought this mascara primer because it was the only one I could find, but I was happily surprised by how well it works.  </li>
      <li>So I tried it again for the next several days, maybe I need more, or less, or more at the tips, or at the base.  </li>
      <li>The handle uses 4x too much plastic to hold a little tiny wand.  </li>

<li> I was a bit shocked when I pulled the wand out of the tube and saw that it was very lightly whitish in color, but fear not it, it goes on clear.  </li>
<li> This may be because the stock seems slightly old and dried out.</li>
<li> I am a long time user of lancome  cills.</li>
<li> It works as a good base, and doesn&#x27;t flake during the day.</li>
<li> I think this may be an old stock, because this product seemed a little dry and gunky.</li>
<li> I like several other Elf products</li>
<li> Dry and made my lashes clumpy.</li>
<li> put this on and let it dry for a minute or two.  </li>
<li> Instructions state to put on lashes and let dry fully before you apply mascara.  </li>
<li> It actually looks like I have less lashes and thinner at that.  </li>
<li> I noticed a pretty dramatic difference in the appearance of my eyelashes.  </li>
<li> But if you just want a little extra length sometimes and don&#x27;t want to switch from a trusted mascara, this primer might be just the thing you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
<li> Might leave eyelashes a little white</li>
<li> I contacted the seller, who immediately refunded my money minus $2.  </li>
<li> This product does exactly what I wanted it to and for far less than the expensive department store brands!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had some luck with other elf products (blush, mascara, eyeshadow primer), so I decided to try the elf mascara</li>
<li> and you use less mascara with it.</li>
<li> I then used some elf mascara (in black) over it.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t come dried out at all.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s all dried out and they don&#x27;t allow you to return it</li>
<li> am not using this every day; it&#x27;s a little dramatic for the office (for me, personally, anyway).  </li>
<li> I just don&#x27;t get it, seems like a pointless product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d been using one of the false fiber mascaras (from L&#x27;Oreal) but got tired of the constant clumping.  </li>
<li> Clumpy and hard to apply.</li>
<li> There was hardly any primer in the applicator.  </li>
<li> Why can&#x27;t manufacturers consider unnecessary waste?  </li>
<li> Also, the primer doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as it needs to be.  </li>
<li> Not great.</li>
<li> I have really thin eyelashes (</li>
<li> And the container is unnecessarily bulky.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m really sad that I bought this.</li>
<li> The shape of the applicator makes it difficult to rotate as I am applying.  </li>

    <li> I use this primer every day now, it gives my lashes extra legth, volume and definition. While following the instructions is important - waitng half an hour before applying mascara over it will most likely be the reason for clumps - it only takes a few seconds for it to dry. As a matter of fact, I am buying a couple of these for my girlfriends, can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have really thin eyelashes (non existing lol) and the primer really does make a more thicker difference along the mascara.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what I wanted it to and for far less than the expensive department store brands! My lashes look longer and my mascara stays on longer, what more could you ask from a primer?</li>
    <li> best primer on the planet!</li>
    <li> I formerly used a product from Lancôme that performed better than this but of course it was several dollars higher in price. I like several other Elf products but this one doesn&#x27;t really do the job I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> Great primer for the price. Helped my mascara stay on without flaking and it works fantastic as a brow primer after you put on your eye brow pencil.</li>
    <li> I am only wondering how long the quantity will last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really sad that I bought this. Doesn&#x27;t do anything and I regret buying it. If I could return it, I would.</li>
    <li> Dry and made my lashes clumpy.</li>
    <li> The shape of the applicator makes it difficult to rotate as I am applying.  Also, the primer doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as it needs to be.  It adds a layer to my eyelashes, but it doesn&#x27;t thicken my eyelashes like MAC&#x27;s primer does.</li>
    <li> I got this to try it out and so I will wait and see how it works</li>
    <li> I think this may be an old stock, because this product seemed a little dry and gunky. It did not do much for my lashes in terms of appearance, but it made mascara a bit easier to apply-- the mascara goes on more smoothly and I need to use less mascara when I already have a base of this stuff. It seems to work best when the mascara is applied before the primer is fully dry. I did need to use a lash comb to remove some clumps from the primer. This may be because the stock seems slightly old and dried out. I find that using a mascara primer (any kind) protects against lash fall-out and damage from daily mascara use.</li>
    <li> I cannot say whether this product is any good becase the one I received was basically dried out. Will not buy this item again.</li>
    <li> this is bs! I got scammed + ended up getting baby chloe he&#x27;s like is this a joke?  !!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything....it really serves no purpose and is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It works as a good base, and doesn&#x27;t flake during the day.</li>
    <li> Not great. Clumpy and hard to apply.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF CANT BE WITHOUT IT .BUT NOW THAT ELF CARING IT ON THEIR WEBSITE FOR $3 I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO ORDER IT FROM HERE FOR $9 SO IT&#x27;S A;; ABOUT SAVING MONEY !!! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a while and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  My lashes have grown since I started using it at night before going to bed and this makes run of the mill drugstore mascara look like a million bucks!</li>
    <li> This mascara primer goes on smoothly and seems to works well in extending my lashes Plus, the price is unbeatable!</li>
    <li> I really like this primer for the price it is a deal!. I use it under 3D mascara it makes the mascara go on smoothly and very little clumping. I&#x27;ll be purchasing this forever. thank you e.l.f.</li>
    <li> I find that this primer gives my lashes extra length, so I like it. Can&#x27;t complain for the three dollars I paid for it off the ELF website.</li>
    <li> My wife will not Recommend this one. It delivers what you pay for, but it&#x27;s not quality.</li>
    <li> this stuff is fantastic. makes mascara last longer and you use less mascara with it. vegan brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been using one of the false fiber mascaras (from L&#x27;Oreal) but got tired of the constant clumping.  I&#x27;ve had some luck with other elf products (blush, mascara, eyeshadow primer), so I decided to try the elf mascara primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on and let it dry for a minute or two.  I then used some elf mascara (in black) over it.  I noticed a pretty dramatic difference in the appearance of my eyelashes.  They definitely looked longer and darker.  This product didn&#x27;t clump or flake at all, for me.  It also seems to last the whole day; I wore it to work and my eyelashes looked the same at the end of the day as they did at the beginning (so I had it on for about 10 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not using this every day; it&#x27;s a little dramatic for the office (for me, personally, anyway).  But if you just want a little extra length sometimes and don&#x27;t want to switch from a trusted mascara, this primer might be just the thing you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Does its job good. Might leave eyelashes a little white but that is fine cause you still have to put on mascara</li>
    <li> Seems to work - don&#x27;t think I would buy again though</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I wish the formula was thicker. I need several coats to make any kind of difference. I have good lashes. I like them to look fuller and more dramatic. This doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I love the rest of their products. This just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> As someone who has very sensitive eyes, I really like this primer.  I was a bit shocked when I pulled the wand out of the tube and saw that it was very lightly whitish in color, but fear not it, it goes on clear.  One of the benefits of using a clear primer is that your not layering on coat after coat of mascara to cover the white.  I love the fact that I am able to use this primer and then a single coat of mascara and I end up with very natural and soft looking eyelashes.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s all dried out and they don&#x27;t allow you to return it</li>
    <li> This product worked OK, but I didn&#x27;t notice enough of a difference when using it.  Now it is sitting in my make-up drawer, unused.....</li>
    <li> I love ELF make up, been using this primer for awhile. It didn&#x27;t come dried out at all. It does it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
    <li> I saw this on amazon and had to try it.  It works pretty good and I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing more.  I havent seen this in the regular stores i frequent that carry elf products.  So, I&#x27;m happy to report that its pretty good for very little money.</li>
    <li> Normally I&#x27;m nearly always thrilled at the beauty products I buy on amazon.  This was not the case with this product.  Instructions state to put on lashes and let dry fully before you apply mascara.  So I did just that, a good 1/2 hour before.  It clumps my lashes together and actually the mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long.  It actually looks like I have less lashes and thinner at that.  So I tried it again for the next several days, maybe I need more, or less, or more at the tips, or at the base.  After many different levels of application, I came to the conclusion that this simply doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I tossed it and my lashes look better with the MAC false lash mascara alone.  Don&#x27;t bother, it&#x27;s not like it cost very much, but it was a dissapointment.</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of lancome  cills. It works great but is very expensive.  I decided to try this product as a cheaper alternative.  I&#x27;m not sure if it works as good but for the price it&#x27;s really close! 2 coats plus an eyelash  curler  and I got great results!</li>
    <li> maybe this is true of all lash primers, but it is pretty stiff, meaning that any mascara I put on afterward looks clumpy.  Sure, it lengthens, but really not any more than any lengthening mascara, and if you went that route at least you wouldn&#x27;t have clumpy lashes.  I just don&#x27;t get it, seems like a pointless product.</li>
    <li> Works adequately, but not waterproof.  And the brush is too fat.  And the container is unnecessarily bulky.  The handle uses 4x too much plastic to hold a little tiny wand.  Think landfills. Why can&#x27;t manufacturers consider unnecessary waste?  We don&#x27;t need to be tricked into thinking there&#x27;s more product than we&#x27;re actually getting, do we?  e.l.f. doesn&#x27;t test on animals, so that&#x27;s great.  The U.S. should ban all animal testing anyway.</li>
    <li> I honestly only bought this mascara primer because it was the only one I could find, but I was happily surprised by how well it works.  It makes my eyelashes look fuller in comparison to just using mascara without priming first.</li>
    <li> There was hardly any primer in the applicator.  I contacted the seller, who immediately refunded my money minus $2.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the seller, not the product.</li>
    <li> This made my lashed clumpy, waist of time and money. I gave into the hype about this primer, you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
