<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and the curls they last me for 2 weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, but I can already tell that it works just as good if not better the more expensive one that I used to have! Does big pretty curls and heats up fast!</li>
    <li> Good product,  fast shipping.</li>
    <li> THIS IS IT! I have waist length straight hair and I have been trying in vain for YEARS to find a curling iron, hot rollers, curling wand etc that will give me soft waves and not fall flat in 20 minutes. After buying countless styling tools I have finally found the holy grail. If you have long straight hair that doesn&#x27;t take easily to curling and you are looking for soft flirty beachy waves, this is your wand. Don&#x27;t even hesitate.</li>
    <li> Hard to use and didn&#x27;t like the fact that you couldn&#x27;t adjust temperature. I&#x27;m sure more experienced people would enjoy this but I find a curling iron to be much easier to use.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and it&#x27;s very untamed naturally so I use this when I straighten first to give my hair the beach wave look.  for a tighter, yet tamed curl, I blow dry my hair 1st and use this to style. Those are the 2 looks I use for but I also use it for touch up and it&#x27;s really time efficient!  I love this wand!</li>
    <li> This is holding up well for my daughter. She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have the money to buy expensive hair styling equipment so I was glad to find this wand curler for a decent price. My hair is sleek and stick-straight so sometimes it takes a couple tries to get the curl. It makes beautiful curls, though! I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments every time I curl my hair and everyone says it looks natural. After this, I&#x27;m never going back to those clip curlers!</li>
    <li> This styler has stood up to time. Used daily, it keeps on going whereas other brands of the same product have broken easily.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. I&#x27;ve had this curling iron for a little under four months and I loved it. I only used it about 5 times and it did great things to my hair. But I went to plug it in and it EXPLODED. In my face!! There was absolutely no damage to it before. And I had plugged it in by its self. Next thing I know I hear a huge Pop and I look over to see this. This could of done a lot more damage. Could of hurt my house or hurt me. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I loved the curling iron and all my friends loved it. But in the end it was a waste of 30 bucks. Would love another one but no way am I wasting another thirty bucks.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I&#x27;m so glad it came with the glove because I&#x27;m the girl that always burns herself and people ask what&#x27;s on my neck.  This is a great curling wand and is just so much easier than the curling irons with the clamps.  If you haven&#x27;t used one of these, you want to start where you grip and and start wrapping at the root.  I really love this thing!  It&#x27;s not too expensive and an overall great purchase.</li>
    <li> Best wand Ive ever owned.</li>
    <li> Works with hair is completely dry. My hair is long down my back and takes approx 30 minutes to do with this product. I like it the same amount as my normal hair curler.</li>
    <li> This wand is great! I have hair that normally won&#x27;t hold a curl for nothing! This is great for beach waves use some salt spray before and you&#x27;ll have hold all day. Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> this is the best curling iron EVER!  I have fine, blonde hair that NEVER holds curl.  But somehow this one does!  We just took family pictures on a freezing, ultra windy day.  I expected to come home and see flat, ugly curls, but it honestly looked like my hair had been curled 5 minutes earlier!  I dont get it!  It&#x27;s like magic!  Use the glove though.  I burn my fingers and wrist whenever I don&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> Perfect! My hair is pretty much impossible to curl, friends have tried curling it &amp;#34;their way&amp;#34; and hairdresser most time had no clue, so they just flat ironed it. Until one day I went and had my hair done by someone that had been doing it a while, and she recommended this, she said to make sure its ceramic!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT, FAST to curl, it does not matter if I take 30 min to do it or just grab big chunks and do it in 5 min, stays all day!</li>
    <li> Does not work on shorter hair.  Don&#x27;t get unless you have long hair.  My hair is thick and chin length.</li>
    <li> This works great. It takes a while to learn to use it if you are used to a regular curling iron with a clasp, but it&#x27;s awesome. Just watch out, it&#x27;s very very hot (I have a nasty scar on my hand), but the high heat is part of why it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think the claims about clasp-less irons being better for your hair are true, at least judging from my hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted a curling wand that gave me nice, even curls.  This does that, and it also heats up well.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.... best wand ever!!! No need to spend a fortune on those other wands bc this one is amazing. It gets really hot and the curls last literally for like two days!</li>
    <li> my new favorite thing! i highly recommend if you want a wand to get this one!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after only 1 use!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have tried everything and no success - the light won&#x27;t even turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super bummed did a lot of looking before I bought this model.</li>
    <li> This is a great curling wand!  A glove comes with it and you will get burned if you don&#x27;t use it!  That said, I was super impressed with how curly my hair was DAYS after curling it with this wand.  I have long, thick hair and as long as I didn&#x27;t try to curl too much at once it would produce great results.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted and for a great price.</li>
    <li> This one has been so far a great curler, easy to use and the price is good. Gives a super natural and cute waves. I like it a lot :)</li>
    <li> This is my first curling wand but I have used curling irons in the past. I recently cut over 8 inches off my hair and needed something with a smaller diameter. My hair stylist uses a wand on my hair and makes gorgeous waves. I was very happy to be able to recreate them at home easily with this curling wand. My hair holds curls pretty well but when using this product I can have curls in my hair all day without even using hairspray! I think it goes a little faster then using a curling iron and I will probably get even faster with practice. It gets really hot and you don&#x27;t have to hold the hair on for too long to achieve a curl. It&#x27;s a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love love love my new curler its easy and leaves beautiful bouncy curls....don&#x27;t regret buying it....I have fine limp hair,,,this gives me volume and I feel much more confident I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use and perfect for my hair length. I have long hair (a little longer than half way down my back) and it all fits on the rod. My hair stays curled for a good length of time and then by the next day has light waves and a lot of body in it. Can&#x27;t complain for this price compared to the $150 ones.. I&#x27;d say it does the same job..</li>
    <li> BEST CURLING IRON EVER!!! This curling iron makes my hair look like I just left the salon. The curls stay for days. Buy this curling iron and you will throw all the other ones you own away just like I did. I have told anyone that has asked about this curling iron.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my niece who absolutely loves it! Her hair looks amazing when using it!</li>
    <li> I just received it in the mail so I don&#x27;t have a long-standing experience with this product, but my first use of it was thrilling. My hair is thin and long. It is a challenge getting it to curl well and then just stay for any period of time without having to use gobbs of hairspray...which then ruins the look anyway. I barely used any hairspray with this and the curl is gorgeous!!! I&#x27;m soooo pleased!</li>
    <li> Great curling wand for getting those beachy waves. The glove is useful to protect your hand!</li>
    <li> My first curling wand. Heats fast, gets the job done, but I need to practice. Value for money item.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need to spend your money on expensive curling irons! This one is absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> Great quality iron! Just as described.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and this works like a charm. Tried using the glove for about 2 minutes but tossed it after I realized it wasn&#x27;t really necessary. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend more on a super &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; wand.</li>
    <li> This works great and is very good quality. Makes cute waves in your hair.</li>
    <li> Once you figure out how to use this product safely it is amazing. My daughters have burned themselves several times doing each others hair.</li>
    <li> I love my new styler easy to use and great out come! I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to doing my hair and this works great and quick!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Works amazingly on long hair, no clip for kinks&lt;br /&gt;and untapered, so the curl looks wonderful</li>
    <li> love it! gets so hot and is so cool how its orange also the way to is packaged made me love it so much more it in a little lollypop! the barrel is a little shorter than i expected but it works perfect and my hair can grow a ton and it will still work! for sure just as good as any 200$ one for sure try this out</li>
    <li> delivered fast. works perfectly, i like this better than the conair wand because it&#x27;s thicker, works better for long hair</li>
    <li> This curling iron does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to: curl your hair. Yes, it is a bit hot, but if you use the glove, use the rubber end that&#x27;s provided, and proceed with caution, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. This curls my medium length fine hair with ease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;s stupid easy to burn yourself with this thing, but the gorgeous curls/waves it produces make it SO worth it. I approve. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S It shipped fairly quickly also, so that was a plus!</li>
    <li> So regretted I got this. I got burnt so many times its RIDICULOUS. Don&#x27;t buy!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was very optimistic about this wand. I was in the market for a 1in all the way through and the price was good! It does work well ... I use to for waves. But it has no temperate option not that I ever set my tools high because of I have flat fine hair. But this wand does not get very hot ... I think if it got hotter it would be of better use to me. And the glove is made out of ... Like a bath glove. If you hold the iron with your fingers you&#x27;ll feel it through the glove.</li>
    <li> I love the curling iron as it heats up super fast and stays hot!!! Unfortunately the curls wouldn&#x27;t stay tight and formed for me. I have hair that falls to the middle of my back. My hair is normal not to thick not to thin.I believe the 1 inch isnt for me maybe for girls with longer hair. I have ordered a 1/2 and am hopeful for those tight curls I dream of and not beachy waves this one gave me.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter for xmas and she loved it! It made the right wavy curls and didn&#x27;t crimp or get tangles. We highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this product heats up fast, but it didn&#x27;t work on my hair. I think if you have thinner hair, it might work better. My hair is very thick, and a little wavy, so it didn&#x27;t work well for me. This product heats up fast and very easy to use, just don&#x27;t forget to wear glove when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awesome!!!  My daughter loves this. She has straight hair and the curl lasts for two days!!!  Not the same curl as used with traditional iron.</li>
    <li> This wand works great.  Perfect size for med to loose waves.  I have layered hair and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about buying this wand after reading some of the reviews. I bought it from Ulta cuz I waited too long to get it from Amazon. It&#x27;s the perfect length for my hair. You can&#x27;t adjust the temp, but it gets plenty hot. This wand gives me the beautiful big curls I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have owed two or three $200-250 curling wands and they didn&#x27;t even compare to this! I&#x27;m amazed at how well this works. The cord doesn&#x27;t twist which is great. It&#x27;s easy to set on the counter top because it has a stable prop underneath it. It&#x27;s light, and my arm never gets tired. With the expensive wands, they send you with a silk heat resistant glove that is hard to section hair  and with this one you get a more textured glove which grips hair very well without it being rough. For the money...it&#x27;s way worth it. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> The wand works fine however the glove was definitely not included. I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times!</li>
    <li> It heat up fast and can curl well. But beware of the heatness on hair since it only has on and off mode. We don&#x27;t know how many degree it can be when it heat up.&lt;br /&gt;Love it comes with free gloves. Maybe can have a bigger wand soon, so that user can curl more natural &amp; wavy hair styles. Anyway, it worth the price.</li>
    <li> It works well. the only thing is you have to practice every day.  it took me 30 min for first week, now 10-15min.  Get burn easy.  becareful. The hair stay curly for 24 hrs. don&#x27;t need hairspray. Nice color.</li>
    <li> Just wow. My hair never does what I want it to do. But with this thing even I can get those beautiful waves and curls. Took me a while to realize that I only have to keep it in my hair for a few seconds. It gets really hot! I have really long, pretty thick hair. I don&#x27;t have to section it. I just go around my head, take big strands, wrap it around, count to ten and voil&amp;aacute;... Beautiful waves that last for days. Just make sure to use heat protection. This thing is HOT!</li>
    <li> My hair is hard to curl and this gives me the loose curls I have been wanting. The only reason i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it looked banged up and scratched when i received it and it was in plastic so I&#x27;m not sure how it was scratched.</li>
    <li> This wand is pretty amazing. I have thin, bone straight hair and this wand is perfect. I have another wand thats tapered (Conair) and I like it but this one takes the cake. Perfect for that beach waved look. The cord is great. Very high quality product. Has one switch to turn on and off. Only one temperature setting which is hot! Perfect to keep those gorgeous curls in all day. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard good and bad things about curling wands and had to try one out for myself. I stumbled across tutorials on this wand and had to purchase it. It&#x27;s easy to use and the curls hold great. I have super thick hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl very well but didn&#x27;t have any problems using this. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend :)</li>
    <li> This product works well.  Love the Glove to protect hands.  My daughters hair is long and thick and it makes curling so much easier.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this curler. Its great for the price, and keeps my hair curly all day long. I have really fine, thin, stick straight hair and other curling irons won&#x27;t keep my hair curly but with this one, I can actually sleep and then still wake up with nice hair. It takes some getting used to at first, but after a while you&#x27;ll be a pro. Its easy to use and the glove helps a bit, be careful though because it&#x27;ll still be hot! What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have different heat settings but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curled my sister&#x27;s, cousin&#x27;s, and friends&#x27; hair using this and they all love it.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is amazing! I get the perfect curls that I have been looking for. Great quality. Same as pictured.</li>
    <li> First wand I have bought and it works way better than a curling iron. Leaves my hair with a beachy wave. My hair never curls. Have gotten lots of compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> I love this curling rod! I looked at quite a few before I purchased one, and one of the biggest things I was looking for was a rod that was NOT tapered at the end. I wanted a rod that was 1 inch the whole way down. I have another curling wand that does taper at the end, and I find that my hair tends to slip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual heated part is long enough so that I can actually fit all of my hair, once wrapped, on it. I read a few reviews that said some wands were short, and longer hair didn&#x27;t fit on the rod part. I have hair that falls 6-7 inches past my shoulder and I don&#x27;t have any problems with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no temperature control, which wasn&#x27;t a problem for me, and the rod gets sufficiently hot so that it gives a great curl after about 10 seconds (for me; my hair is in between straight and curly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the glove, but I&#x27;ve had a bit of practice, so I don&#x27;t need it, but it&#x27;s good that it includes one for people to practice with. However, it&#x27;s much easier without the glove :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read some reviews where some people said they wished the electrical cord was longer. I was a little wary about this when I ordered it, but when I use the wand, I never notice any issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great curling wand, it heats very quickly, its an awesome price, and it gives pretty beachy waves. Try it out!</li>
    <li> I loved this curling iron but it gets VERY hot &amp; 2x I got burned pretty bad. I ended up returning it. Especially since my 9 month yr old is crawlig around. Though I normally do my hair when is away from me but still. I still have scabs from the burns.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Fast and easy to use makes my hair look amazing holds better then a curling iron and my hair has the look I want !! I wish I bought it sooner!</li>
    <li> I have been on a journey to find the perfect hair product to give myself long-lasting wavy-curls. &amp; I am pleased to announce, I HAVE FOUND IT! RIGHT HERE! It does take awhile to get use to using without burning yourself, so I did use the glove for the first few weeks, till I finally got use to it. It only takes me like 10-15mins to curl my hair &amp; I have long THICK hair. It best of all, (with a little bit of mousse) the curls last all day. Even some next mornings after sleeping on it, I still have curls. I get lots of compliments from friends &amp; family on how they love my curls.&lt;br /&gt;So thank you, Bed Head!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Makes beautiful soft, full curls.  The glove helps to avoid burning your hand while making the curls.  Makes your hair look amazing!!</li>
    <li> Omg! this is the best thing i ever bought I love this curler its make my hair look fix without looking like u try to hard. it makes it look natural</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. My hair looks like a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model&#x27;s after 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> The packing was vert cute I loved it although the product it self could get in the way.. to bad it does not have a temp control because it can get vert hot and damage your hair the style does work pretty good.</li>
    <li> Unfortantely, this doesn&#x27;t work very well. Maybe I received a lemon...</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful curling wand. It&#x27;s not tapered, so it produces nice, even, soft curls that hold well in my long hair. It only has one heat setting, but heats up quickly and, as other reviewers have said, it gets VERY hot. I&#x27;ve burned my fingers a few times, but it is not difficult to use. It&#x27;s my favorite hair tool and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Got mine for Christmas and love it!! The first day it curls a little too well haha , but a little tug after unwrapping and it loosens up! Second day is the perfect beach wave! After trying several this one has been my holy grail until something better comes along. Only complaint is that I wish the length of the barrel for hair placement was longer for my long hair but other than that I love it And takes no time at all!</li>
    <li> This is the third curling wand I purchased and the thrid time was a charm.  I own 2 Remington Silk Ceramic Styling Wands (slim .5&amp;#34; - 1&amp;#34; and wide 1&amp;#34; - 1.5&amp;#34;).  I found the slim to give tight curls, not the waves I was looking for and the wide was too big to give good waves, my waves would look good until noon and then droop.  The bed head wand which is 1&amp;#34; the entire length is perfect for creating long lasting waves that are not too loose or too tight and my hair lasts all day.  Their is no temperature control, just an on/off switch.  This concerned me at first since I typically like to be able to control the temp of my styling tools, but no issues - it heats up quickly and the temp works well for my hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great, love the curls but... I threw away the heat protective glove because come on, how lame is that?  I now have a scar on my pinkie telling me just how not lame that glove was. Seriously, keep the glove.</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling wand to replace my curling iron that finally quit working. The wand heats up very quickly and holds curls all day! I have thick wavy hair naturally and this wand is great for my hair type!</li>
    <li> I wish that I had purchased the tapered wand now because it would have been easier to use on my daughter&#x27;s very long hair.  The glove didn&#x27;t work well for me, so I didn&#x27;t use it and of course I managed to slightly burn my fingertips from time-to-time.  The product itself worked well and as usual I received my shipment really quick.</li>
    <li> As a girl with long straight thin hair, my hair doesn&#x27;t curl easily. I&#x27;ve had multiple curling irons and they leave my hair curled for an hour and then they fall out and leave my hair straight. My most recent curling iron I had didn&#x27;t work so great. I would curl it and it would be even stay for the remainder of the time it took to curl my hair. With that iron it took very long to get all of my hair curled. It probabaly took about one hour to curl all of my hair. But like I said before the curls didn&#x27;t stay for even an hour. So after awhile I was really annoyed that it didn&#x27;t work anymore so I went to Ulta to look at their curling irons and wands. I eventually came across this curling wand. It was about $29.99 so I decided to look on here for cheaper. When I saw that the curling wand was only $19.99 I decided to order it. I am SO SO pleased with the results of this curling wand. It took about 15-20 minutes for me to curl all of my hair and the curls lasted all day with a little bit of hair moose. I cannot even explain how happy I am that this curling wand works for me. My hair has never been able to curl easily but this one worked. I am looking forward to purchasing more bed head products in the future.</li>
    <li> It took some getting used to, but I love this product now. The ends are a little hard to curl, and the glove that comes with it isn&#x27;t completely heat resistant, so I recommend purchasing a higher quality styling glove.</li>
    <li> Happy with the product</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly but doesn&#x27;t get so hot that my hair is smoking.  Love this and the curls it gives me!</li>
    <li> Works great and holds curls for the entire day/night! I have long, silky hair that usually doesnt hold curls too well but this has been the best curling iron I have purchased. I was worried that since there was no varying heat setting I would not be able to get the iron hot enough but I have no problem with the heat setting of the iron. Since I have longer hair the looser curls usually look better on me so I usually plan to curl my hair an hour or two before my event so it has time to loosen up a bit. I do wish Bed Head had this curling wand in 1 1/4 inch though for a quick loose curl. I would definitely purchase another in this size too!</li>
    <li> my hair is fine and curly/wavy so it holds a curl well, but the natural curls are rather unruly.  the size of this barrel is great for loose waves.&lt;br /&gt;the glove makes it hard to hold hair, and is not really needed.</li>
    <li> Great curling wand.  You can use it for a few seconds for fairly large, beachy waves or use it for tight curls.  It&#x27;s easy to use and my hair holds the curl.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. Perfect wavy curls that last. The curls lasted a full two days for me and I have medium-thick hair. Not to mention the very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it so far</li>
    <li> I love this wand! It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
    <li> This styling wand is the best tool I&#x27;ve ever owned! Perfect curls every time. I have very long, thick hair and have absolutely no issues. The high heat makes it so I don&#x27;t have to wait long for the curl. WEAR THE GLOVE. Even just a graze across my skin caused a blister.  I&#x27;m still learning how to use it, but regardless of the blisters, I use it at least every other day.</li>
    <li> I use it a number of times a week.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I really like this iron. It gets really hot so my curls/waves hold all day. The wand style can be kind of tricky to use at first, but if you&#x27;re careful you&#x27;ll be able to catch on without injury. There is a glove included. It works, but you will still feel hear through it so just be careful how you handle the wand.</li>
    <li> Works fast and gives awesome curls. Gets super hot.</li>
    <li> I love bedhead! I have 3 curling irons now and i will never ever buy any other brand! It works effortlessly on my fine hair and on my roommates thick tresses! Stays for up to 3 days! Completely changed my look! I curl my hair every day now in just a few minutes!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron!  I have so many tools but this one takes the cake! Make beautiful curls!</li>
    <li> First off, this was a FAST delivery, I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Made me very happy!&lt;br /&gt;Second, my hair is short, barely makes it to my shoulders, frizzes easily, and no luck with other irons. I&#x27;ve been looking for a curling iron that gave me the short wavey look, that ACTUALLY wouldn&#x27;t fall flat and/or frizzes, and let me tell you, my hair never holds a curl or wave if my life depended on it, not even for a half hour! Well, it has been 3 hours now. I did house cleaning, I sweat, AND its super humid here.... My waves stayed! As you can tell in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond happy! This thing is so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bed Head! Wooo!!!&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I used no hair spray actually, like I usually absolutely HAVE to! I just used my biotin oil from organix, and NO FRIZZ! AHH! ;D</li>
    <li> Such an easy way to get that messy wavy look.</li>
    <li> Excellent curling wand. The ceramic finish makes for the perfect set of curls. I find the glove a bit unnecessary but thats up to the user.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome tool!!! I was a bit scared at first, thinking I may burn myself, but within a time or two I got the hang of it fast. This is great for make nice curls and waves.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Nothing really to say. The glove protects, the iron heats up properly. I guess it could use and automatic shut off feature.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great inexpensive curling iron that holds a curl really well. I have straight hair and I like to make waves and it seems to hold for a long time with the right amount of hairspray. Only con would be that it only has one heat setting and it gets really hot. I&#x27;ve burned my arm but if you&#x27;re new to this like me, I suggest wearing a long sleeve and the glove while curling your hair.</li>
    <li> I love my wand ! It curls perfect in about 10 seconds the heat is fine if doesn&#x27;t burn your hair , I love this item I&#x27;m happy with the results !</li>
    <li> College daughter loves it. No burned hair and cooling tip helps with no more burned fingers. Saved so much money by buying it on Amazon than at my hairdressers.</li>
    <li> Great tool for hair care.  It does what its supposed to do...can&#x27;t ask for more than that.  Recommended for anti bed-head.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this Styler daily, and she loves it!  It is easy to use and the results are fantastic!</li>
    <li> All I can say is OUCH!!!!  Even with the not-so-great glove that came with it, I still managed to burn myself...  This model does not have an adjustable temperature setting, which I did not like.  It seemed to take forever to curl my hair, which normally takes curl really well.  I would suggest you save your money and not buy this.</li>
    <li> Curls wonderfully. I&#x27;ve used a few different wands and for the price this one definitely beats the others. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually new to the curling wand world and the first one I ever tried wasn&#x27;t the same size throughout, it tapered to a smaller tip.  After using that I thought there must be something better out there that was the same size all the way down and didn&#x27;t make goofy looking curls.  One search on Amazon and I found it!  I LOVE IT!  I have 4 children and long hair - I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on my hair in the morning and most days I pull it back but since I bought this and mastered it I&#x27;ve fixed my hair nearly every day because it is SO easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time.  You can use smaller amounts of hair and leave on longer for tighter curls or more hair, less time for waves.  OR do what I do - Wear it curly one day and when I get up the next day it&#x27;s all waves.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had with this is that I managed to burn my wrist pretty bad, even while wearing the glove.  Lesson learned - applied lavender oil to the burn and I now take a washcloth and wrap it around my wrist and tuck it into the glove so I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning it again.  I noticed some reviews complain about the glove - It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to a curling iron and trust me, if something happens to mine I&#x27;m buying another one asap!</li>
    <li> Got it today, and I am in love. Very nice curls that last at least up to 10 hrs. I prefer curling with this than my straightner, which I&#x27;ve been doing for years.</li>
    <li> I believe this tool does the work. It curls very nice and it heats up very quick! I believe it&#x27;s perfect for beginners like me.  I haven&#x27;t used it in a long time so I don&#x27;t know much about it. Rating according to my first impression.</li>
    <li> Came, Saw, Bought Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;You should get it here.&lt;br /&gt;No regrets.&lt;br /&gt;Love it more and more every time I use it.</li>
    <li> After watching a few hair turorials I became convinced that I needed a different curling iron. This one is very inexpensive and works very well. This is my first iron without the clamp and I absolutely love it. It is quick and creates great uniform waves.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this curling wand. It heats up very fast and creates smooth, pretty curls.</li>
    <li> I love the curls that this makes, so I do use it. But I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve burned myself, usually on the tip of the curling wand. I don&#x27;t know why they wouldn&#x27;t have made it with a cool tip since there is no reason to have a hot poker on the end of this thing. Every time I get burned it blisters and lasts for weeks &#x27;cause the thing is so hot. As much as I love the curls, I&#x27;m going to replace this with one that has a cool tip.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! It took me a time or two to get the hang of it but once I did, it&#x27;s a fantastic tool. I can quickly give my hair some wave so it&#x27;s great for mornings when I am rushing to get ready for work. When I have more time, I can get more of a curl out of it. Seriously happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This wand worked for 2 days then just stopped working!!</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful waves but it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to get the job done quickly. I find myself redoing most of my hair. Might be fine for really thin fine hair that is easy to curl. So far, nothing beats the pink tapered remington curling rods. Those things are amazing... AND cheap! I&#x27;d return this if I still had the box but I threw it away. Please order something else. This just isn&#x27;t worth your money.</li>
    <li> A very nice and handful device</li>
    <li> Great product! Specially for second day hair in my case :) recommend it!</li>
    <li> Impossible to use...even the handle gets uncomfortably hot.</li>
    <li> Works well, bigger curls, does a great messy curl look.</li>
    <li> This curling iron creates stunning &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; waves. I purchased the 1 inch (my hair has layers and is 4 inches past my shoulders) and this straight cliipless barrel is perfect for creating natural looking waves (unlike the unnatural looking curls I get from a traditional iron with a clip). Love that it only has a on/off button. It&#x27;s about as straight forward as it gets. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it feels a little &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and like it might stop working after a year or two...but for only $25 who cares :)</li>
    <li> Its the perfect size and at such a great price! It makes perfect ringlet curls or perfect waves. Super happy with it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome curling iron! I have tried so many in the past and have always burned myself and gotten that dang crease from under the big clip. Not with this one! I don&#x27;t get burned and my curls are perfect every time!</li>
    <li> This wand blows my mind. It is perfect for long hair and there is no snagging at the base. It heats up in seconds. Leave it on for a few seconds for more of a wave or a little longer for tighter curls.</li>
    <li> love this curling wand it gives my hair volume n big waves just the way i like them i will purchase another one just incase i misplace the other one</li>
    <li> It works so well. I finally found something that can curl my hair quickly. Usually I don&#x27;t have that much luck with curlers but this does the job well. I got recommended by a friend and now I&#x27;m buying it as a present for another. Definitely recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Loved! So easy to use, and the curls aren&#x27;t too loose or too tight. Stays for hours!</li>
    <li> LOVE this wand! Mine has worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews. It works amazing and fast. Heats up and cools down very quickly. Would buy again. I have had no troubles thus far.</li>
    <li> I have this wand and a Remington conical 1/2 - 1 inch wand.  I am happier with this wand for my needs.  It doesn&#x27;t have multiple heat settings, instead you just turn it on and that is it.  It heats to 400 degrees and for my hair that is the setting i need anyways.  This gives me nice large loose waves which is exactly what i want.  The conical shaped hair wands feel useless for my hair length because it is so long it always goes down to the smallest section and makes tighter curls which I don&#x27;t want.  The Remington is perfect for doing my daughters hair, where i want tight tiny curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did seem to take longer than 30s to fully heat up though and that was one downside I had with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to note that the glove that comes with this hair wand fits perfect.  It is made of a fabric that stretches and molds to the hand.  The Remington glove felt bulky and didn&#x27;t fit right so I refused to wear it and just dealt with possible finger burns (a few times).  This glove was easy to wear and I will use each time I use this hair wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is my new FAVORITE hair tool!! It is so so so easy to use. Some people have complained about the glove, but I don&#x27;t use the glove at all and have never burned my hand. It heats up really fast. There is no heat setting, but they Bed Head knows what they are doing because my curls last all day without going flat. The cord isn&#x27;t too short, but no too long either.</li>
    <li> It heats up so quickly and is so easy. You do have to get used to how to use it but after that its very very easy. I have dark hair and couldnt see the ends of my hair while wearing the glove so i never really got to use it. I tried at first but i kept dropping my hair, not being able to see when i was at the end of it. I have thick, course, wavy, frizzy, long hair. After i get my hair dried, i can do my whole head in about 10 or 15 minutes, depending on the type of curl im going for that day. Depending on how big of sections you do and how long you hold your hair around it, you will get a different affect.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand and would have given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the horrendous glove that comes with it. It&#x27;s more of an exfoliating glove than a heat resistant glove. I have other curling wands that came with more substantial gloves. Other than that I love the curls that I achieve, and handling the wand is very easy.</li>
    <li> This is an all right curling wand, but I don&#x27;t find that it gets hot enough to force my hair to hold a curl. It would be much better if there were adjustable temperature settings.</li>
    <li> This was the best curler I&#x27;ve owned!! It works as good as a $200 one! Deff really happy I ordered this. I use it everyday and it works great with my hair. It curls your hair quick and easy and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a curler</li>
    <li> This curling wand does better than better and gets really hot.Plus the is useless but a little helpful. I never use it. But overall  I absolutely love it. Only got two burns from it so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Im super happy! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This wand is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. The curls look great and last. Plus the wand is dual voltage which is convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> Such a quick and easy way to get great looking curls!  It does take a little bit of practice to not accidentally touch any part of the wand, but after the first time I did my hair I had no problems.  Other methods of curling don&#x27;t work on my thick, long hair, but this works great.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great. I love it! The only thing is, it gets hotter than any tool I&#x27;ve ever had. I accidentally touched it for a nano second and I blistered up. That&#x27;s never happened to me before. Please, avoid this pain and use the glove...!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I love this my hair is just so difficult at times.</li>
    <li> Watched many videos and no matter what I did this wand left me having to fix my hair with other tools. Might work for long hair but my sholder length never looked right.</li>
    <li> I ordered this curling iron in mid-june and it worked great for about 1 1/2 months and then stopped working out of no where. It doesn&#x27;t heat up anymore. This is the first time this has happened and I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> THIS THING IS LIKE BLACK MAGIC!!&lt;br /&gt;Where has it been the past 3 years?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 24 with average hair (not too fine, but not too thick or coarse), but quite a bit of it. Its longer (a little past my chest) and has a decent amount of weight and body. But has become very uncooperative over the years and practically refuses to hold any sort of colume or curls.&lt;br /&gt;After I had my daughter my hair has changed from the lush, thick hair I had in my teens/you to a bit more brittle, less cooperative and a bit finer. And ever since, I could never get any curls to hold for longer than an hour or two... I&#x27;ve tried all types of curling irons, the &amp;#34;straightener technique&amp;#34;, curlers (both velcro &amp;#34;no heat&amp;#34;, as well as heated) and to no avail. I have tried cool-setting them with a dryer, pinning the curls while hot and letting them &amp;#34;set.. everything! (And my hair is also the type that if put in curlers/ponies/etc while wet, the inside will STAY wet. So putting curlers in damp hair over night was also not even an option)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this contraption by the suggestion of a friend. AND MY CURLS ARE STILL AS GREAT AS WHEN I DID THEM. (and that was 6+ hours ago!) I didn&#x27;t need to use any product, setting, cooling, ANYTHING. I just did them and went- I&#x27;ve lift, body and defintion that have yet to go away, Part two of this miracle? It took me LESS THAN HALF the time to style my hair as I normally do. Usually it takes me 45-60 mins or more to curl my hair (that&#x27;s not including dry time at about 15-20 mins) Today? The curling only took about 20-25 mins! And its still staying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am literally in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And its affordable! I would definitely invest in this if I were you. If it doesn&#x27;t work for some reason the way you want it to then at least you didn&#x27;t break the bank on some &amp;#34;salon quality&amp;#34;. But I would be surprised if someone isn&#x27;t at least satisfied with this product, let alone thrilled.</li>
    <li> I Really Like It ! Worth the money Got It On Time ! the glove is a little itchy but other than that it great (:</li>
    <li> This is just a wand. No clamp to hold hair in place. If you lose glove good luck trying to style hair. It heats up way too hot. No heat settings, just really hot. You will burn fingers with or without glove. Too hot for comfort. Think I will stick to a regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> Fast service and perfectly packaged!!!  The product was as described...and was in time for Christmas, even though I had waited almost till the last minute on my shopping!!  :-D</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  Heats up in seconds, curls my hair in seconds, and the curls hold all day.  And it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron that leaves you with beautiful curls. Heats up fast . Would give this 5 stars if you could adjust the heat settings.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!!!  Makes perfects waves!!  Use hair protectant, wrap piece around iron!  Love!! I use glove until I get better at it.</li>
    <li> Gets very very hot. The product itself is good but my hair is still too short to use it :( but I would recommend it to anybody looking for medium sized waves</li>
    <li> This gave my hair the perfect curls. My hair NEVER curls for me and i was told to try out a curling wand and OHMIGAWSH. I am in love!!</li>
    <li> Works great! Definitely no reason to spend high dollar on other brands. Make sure you use the glove - gets super hot.</li>
    <li> I burn my neck every time, but I LOVE how the curls turn out and they look so much better than curling irons. Don&#x27;t bother with the glove though, you can&#x27;t get a good grip on your hair with it.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and this didn&#x27;t get hot enough to do anything.</li>
    <li> After I purchased this wand with my hard-earned babysitting money (I was 15), I bursted into tears and cried to my mother. I was so disappointed with the quality of the wand. I couldn&#x27;t get it to do anything with my hair! Now, it&#x27;s my favorite hot tool! I love it so much! I use it at least twice a week, and it&#x27;s what I use when I curl my hair for homecoming, winter formal, AND prom!! It&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s does loose waves and that are to die for! I always get complimented when I use it. The only downside is that it takes time to figure out how to get the curls just right.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that this was just a round cylinder with no grip for hair.</li>
    <li> Works like a champ. Get&#x27;s hot fast. Love the curls - they last all day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling wand! It gives me big loose, soft curls that I get complements on all of the time. It is a great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this wand. It works perfect for what I need it to do! I don&#x27;t like my hair being in tight curls. This wand leaves it in more of loose curls/waves. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments every time I use it. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Really really love this styler. I have medium to long hair &amp; it leaves soft bouncy curls &amp; waves. This is so much better than the wands that go from thick to thin because those just give you super curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this product.  I have very fine and straight hair. Before this wand if I ever curled my hair I only expected it to last a few hours and only with the help of a massive amount of hair spray.  Now with this curing wand my curls last all day and even then some.  It only takes a few minutes to do my whole head of hair and looks beautiful.  It also heats up very, very quickly. It is usable even before I finish blow drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone who has hard to curl hair and is thinking about purchasing an expensive curling wand, try this one first.  It has done a wonderful job and I am so excited about the results.  I have curled my hair every day since I got it and I am so happy I didn&#x27;t have to pay $125 for these results.</li>
    <li> This curling iron definitely makes great waves and curls, but there is no heat regulation. It gets insanely hot! I was always careful, but a couple times it just slightly brushed my skin and I got really bad burns from it, ones that left lasting marks surprisingly. Use with caution, and maybe wear long sleeves!</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at using a curling wand. A few days practice and I&#x27;m a pro. I used the glove at first, but now I&#x27;m confident enough to do it without. I never mastered a traditional curling iron, so I&#x27;m glad this wand is easy to get used to.</li>
    <li> Love this -- My hair holds the curl wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, great price, no issues. It is quite easy to get burned even when you have experience with curling irons, just have to be careful I guess.</li>
    <li> This curling wand is everything I hoped it would be. It heats up fast, curls nicely, and the curls hold well. I find the size of curl can be easily manipulated by using more or less hair, which is convenient. I searched a lot and through much more expensive wands before deciding on this one, and I&#x27;m glad I made the choice I did. If you actually look at the specs, in material and temperature, it is similar if not better than many very expensive wands. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I do. I can curl all my hair in around 10 minutes and the curls last forever.  There was a learning curve though.  I burned myself a few times when the tip of the curling iron just brushed against my hand, and I guess those scars aren&#x27;t ever going away.  It seems like they could have put some small plastic, heat-proof tip on the end of this curling iron so that it was less like a weapon.  It comes with a rubber tip you can slide onto the end for heat protection, but my hair got caught on it so much it rendered the curling iron functionally useless.  I&#x27;ve learned to just be extra, extra careful.</li>
    <li> I am new to the curling wand world.  I bought one for me and sent one to my daughter.  My daughter says. Hers works great. She has thick straight hair about a little past her shoulders.  As for me on the other hand. My hair is straight , thick and the length is a little past my waist. My hair is not layered.  My hair has always been hard to curl.  Even perms won&#x27;t stay in my hair. With the wand I do get great curls, but can&#x27;t get them to stay all day even with hair spray.  That&#x27;s way the 4 stars.  The wand does get very hot.  I read around 410 degrees, there is only an on off switch no temp control button.  I use the glove and would recommend using it, because it&#x27;s easy to get burned.  I think I just need to practice more with my wand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product. I&#x27;ve been using a tapered curling wand, but my hair is so long it always slips off.  The untapered wand allows me to wrap my super long hair all the way around it and it slips off like silk after the curl!</li>
    <li> My hair literally NEVER holds a curl. By the end of the day I&#x27;m left with flat bumps that used to be big curls.&lt;br /&gt;This curling wand works fantastically! The curls have lasted 3 days so far with very minor touch ups in the morning! For the price, the quality of this this wand is outrageous! Thanks Bedhead!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a wand and had never purchased one before. My friend had one and would always curl my hair with it. She paid 100.00 for hers and mine is just as good if not better. It heats up in about 10 minutes and the curls and waves last all day!</li>
    <li> Worked okay but was missing the glove.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is awesome. They say it is supposed to give you wavy hair, but for me it makes my hair curly. Just be careful not to hit your ears, neck or hands! The glove is very handy</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter last Christmas.  She uses it everyday and loves it.</li>
    <li> I like this styler a lot. Im a little impatient to use it often but when I dedicate 10-15 mins it gives me awesome curls. The longer you hold it the longer the curl will stay and the tighter and bouncier it will be. I have 3c naturally curly hair but I only ever use this on pre-straightened hair.</li>
    <li> This will be a long review because I feel the product deserves it and I really want to express how thrilled I am. First of all, my hair is to my mid back, it&#x27;s poker straight, it&#x27;s not thick but it&#x27;s not super thin either. My hair is IMPOSSIBLE to hold any kind of volume or curl, or it WAS until now. I&#x27;m 25 years old and throughout the ears I have tried it all. I have a $100 curling iron upstairs that couldn&#x27;t provide me any sort of satisfaction. About a month ago I came across a 1/2 inch curling wand on clearance and just thought it was too good of a deal to pass up so I grabbed it for the heck of it. To my surprise I had ringlet curls that lasted 3 days! I kid you not, any other curl has left my hair completely flat in an hour (that is not an exaggeration.. (COMPLETELY STRAIGHT AND FLAT IN ONE HOUR). As much as I love the wand I don&#x27;t want ringlet curls everyday. That&#x27;s when I started my search for a new wand (had to be a wand since I was so thrilled with my new purchase). I did my homework for about two weeks before selectin this one. Most reviews were great. Two downfalls people mentioned was that it was too hot and the glove that&#x27;s included is cheap. I know I need HOT for my hair and I have a glove of my own so they didn&#x27;t bother me. I used the wand as soon as it got here and here&#x27;s what I experienced.&lt;br /&gt;-It is an extremely hot product with no adjustable setting, just an on and off switch. That was not an issue at all. It was a bonus for me that it heats to such a high temperature.&lt;br /&gt;-The wand took maybe a total of 30 seconds to hear up and be ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;-The cord did not tangle the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;-The wand has a rest stand attached so the wand is easy to place on my counter top and it&#x27;s not rolling around. The piece was not in my way either as some curling iron pieces have been.&lt;br /&gt;-The glove is a really odd material and I didn&#x27;t use it, but I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s some sort of better heat protectant material since the wand does get so hot. If the glove is uncomfortable or cheap as some reviews have said, go buy a $6 pair with the money you&#x27;ll save on this product.&lt;br /&gt;-The price of the wand. Super affordable and I would pay $100 if I tested it before knowing the price. It&#x27;s easily a $100 result. So the price is WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;-Another thing I saw in some reviews is that it burns really bad and blisters when applied to skin. It&#x27;s very simple, use a glove to protect your hands. As for the wand burning your arm.... If you take the time to learn how to properly use a styling wand you will never have it touch your arm. ANY heated styling product will burn skin. I did not have any burns when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;-My hair was curled in half the time it normally is when I use even a 1 1/2 inch curling iron. I&#x27;m covering less hair per strand with the wand and still saved myself a good 20 minutes. And I&#x27;m getting tighter curls of course.&lt;br /&gt;-I had previous hair spray left in my hair from the previous day before I used the wand today. I did not need to apply any more after because the curls were staying so tight.&lt;br /&gt;-I ran my fingers through my hair once I was finished and I was off with beautiful curls. The wand added volume as well up top.&lt;br /&gt;-It has none been 4 hours since I curled my hair and I still have fantastic curls! Again, any other irons leave my hair FLAT in ONE HOUR! I am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 hours after received this wand and I am back on Amazon ordering more bed head wands in other size barrels. After years of countless sprays, amplifiers, body boosters, irons, and wands I have FINALLY found one that works for me. I could cry I&#x27;m so happy. If it works for me it can work for anybody! My hair has been out to get me for 20 plus years (I&#x27;m convinced) and this Bed Head Curling Wand has concurred what I thought was impossible. 10 Stars... I would recommend this to anybody and plan to use only Bed Head products on my hair from here on.glove is uncomfortable or cheap as some reviews have said, go buy a $6 pair with the money you&#x27;ll save on this product.&lt;br /&gt;-The price of the wand.

    <li> Makes very perfect and round curls. Good for waves or tight ringlets. Light weight wand and comes with a glove to protect your fingers!</li>
    <li> This wand curls my hair very well but I have burned myself seriously with it twice.  When doing the back of my hair the tip has touched my wrist and I got a 2nd degree burn that eventually became infected.  It took 2 months to heal and was incredibly painful. (I was wearing the protective glove but where it touched the inside of my arm was higher up where the glove didn&#x27;t reach) I just did it again recently so &amp;#34;I have decided to get rid of it and I ordered another one made by&lt;br /&gt;Bed Head that has a cool tip. The green apple 1 inch wand.  The other thing I was not crazy about is that it doesnt have an automatic turn off.</li>
    <li> Works good for people starting out. I am not good with hair by any means but I found it quite easy. Used it on my daughters hair looked like a professional did it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and you cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> one of the BEST curling irons i&#x27;ve ever had. heats up quick, curls don&#x27;t get caught on iron, leaves the best curls that stay wonderfully. my only downside is the glove which gets tangled in my hair. i just bought a different one for a dollar!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand!  I never use the glove since I think it makes it harder to grab pieces of hair, but it does repel the heat (so I probably should use it...).  After curling my hair with this and using no product, it held the curls all day.  It&#x27;s a lot quicker and neater than using a straightener.  I&#x27;m recommending this curling wand to a coworker.  Great buy for the money!</li>
    <li> I really like the way it curls and I always get compliments</li>
    <li> I have thick, long hair. Usually to hold a curl I need to use a ton of hairspray, which leaves my hair stiff, dry and crunchy. This wand is amazing. I got beautiful, soft waves without using any product.  I did this 6 hours ago and they&#x27;re still holding. Would recommend to a friend!  But be very careful.  I burned myswld pretty bad, just a quick touch to the skin was all it took.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get my hair to curl with these as my hands get head trying to hold my car around the styler.  The gloves are thin and you really need something to clamp down fine hair.  It may work if you have thick hair but not at all for my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I love it! After losing my old Walmart purchased wand and not finding it in stores, I decided to order one online. I looked at different wands but finally decided on getting this one. After reading reviews I was excited for it to arrive and once it did I tried it out and the curls looked great. Like every other wand, they let the curls stay in for a while so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when others say they lasted. I put a picture about a day after I did the curls and they still looked nice and wavy. The wand heats up in about 30 seconds or less which is amazing since I&#x27;m always in a rush in the mornings. And as for the appearance, the Orange was sleek and not at all cheap looking. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product! Definitely recommended</li>
    <li> this curling iron is perfect</li>
    <li> This is so much faster to use then the regular curling irons.  It gets hot real quick.  It will take some practice to get used to but its worth it.  I just wish bed head would come out with a 2 inch curler!</li>
    <li> I use this wand all the time. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> For years I have been trying different types of curling irons trying to find one that suited me, I had almost lost hope of finding one until I came across this one. It has done wonders for my hair. I have long thick hair and this curler heats up well enough to style my hair without frying it. It gives me lovely curls that last for quite a while (with hairspray) and I couldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> the barrel is just too big for my hair</li>
    <li> Fabulous iron. Curls fast &amp; oh boy do they last!  It&#x27;s my favorite!! Great price &amp; great curling iron!! It&#x27;s more than half the price than in stores. I have told so many of my friends. This may not be poetic. ..But sincerely, couldn&#x27;t love this more!</li>
    <li> I love this product, just be careful how u used it. I burnt my forehead a few hours before I went to a wedding and I had a big brown patch in the middle of my forehead during the wedding.</li>
    <li> The packaging the wand arrived in was so adorable first off. I always had trouble with traditional clamp curling irons and my hair is thick so the curls fall out super quick, but with this particular wand I don&#x27;t have any problems. It is super easy to use, heats up quick and my curls stay in for a good amount of time even without extra hold products. A must for anyone who loves styling hair!!</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick hair and this works great for the soft curls she wants. I like that it&#x27;s a straight barrel vs the tapered,  which is easier to keep the curl uniform and the hair from sliding down the tapered end of others.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this so much. It gives me the perfect loose curls I&#x27;ve always wanted. I usually curl my hair with my flat iron which creates beautiful curls as well but this is ten times faster. I would definitely buy some type of heat protection spray since I&#x27;m gonna be using this product a lot.</li>
    <li> I have medium thickness hair and this works great for making curls.  It&#x27;s hard to get used to at first because there&#x27;s no clip, but I use the glove it came with and it&#x27;s pretty easy to get used to.  Since you start the curls closer to your head it also seems to make my curls look more volumized and consistent.</li>
    <li> Bought for Daughter on Christmas she said it was the best curling iron she every used curls lasted longer then expected.</li>
    <li> This is a nice curling iron that is high quality and priced right.  This curling iron will provide years of style.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Curl stays without a holding product and can be styled quickly.</li>
    <li> I just wish the curling wand had a temperature gauge, and that the temperature was adjustable. Otherwise, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for styling my fine hair including curling irons of different widths and even old fashioned curlers. The one inch curling wand was really the sweet spot for me. There is no heat adjustment so I&#x27;m careful not to do it too long--I typically hold for about 8 seconds before releasing. I like that this one comes with a glove. Since I started using it I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, does what I need. I found the glove too be harder to use than my bare hand. It could be a little hotter, but it does a very good job. I use this product occasionally, not daily.</li>
    <li> This iron makes soft waves and light curls in my hair. Mind you, I have thin, very straight hair. It&#x27;s a little difficult to wrap all the way around the barrel because I also have really long hair. But, it does the job. Be careful! I already burned myself twice after one use and I tried to be safe.</li>
    <li> Nice curling iron for the price but I don&#x27;t like that you can&#x27;t adjust the heat.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It takes 2-3 times to get the hang of it, but once you do, it works wonders! Curls are beautiful and last for days.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Quick to ship, well packaged, and works like a charm :) Definitely recommend! Heats up very quickly and supplies long lasting, wavy curls.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product, it makes perfect waves and leaves my hair looking a lot more healthy and shiney.</li>
    <li> If I had a dime for every hair product/tool/etc. that I have purchased with high hopes to achieve the look it promises only to use it once and let it die in a corner of my closet I would be rich.  I owned a curling iron for some time.  Occasionally I would pull it out and give it another full-hearted try but to no avail.  My curls never stayed and I always had the dumb looking curling iron clamp crimp near the ends of my hair.  After doing some research - I found the genius idea of a wand.  No more clamp.  But - does it actually work?  YES.  I also like how simple it is.  Just literally an on/off switch.  No 10 billion heat settings or other unnecessary bogus features.  The glove also is a great help.  It really does prevent you from accidentally burning yourself. Just throw on the glove - take a section of hair - wrap it around any witch way - hold it for a couple seconds and voila.  Simple as that.  I also like how the wand comes with a little stand piece mounted on it opposeite the on/off switch that keeps the wand portion from touching your bathroom counter when you set it down.  Nice long cord as well - the kind that doesn&#x27;t get super kinked/tangled.  You can tell this is a high quality tool.  High quality, simple, to the point, it does one thing and does it well.  Coming from someone with fine hair that never used to hold a curl - I am happy to say this is no longer a problem.  I am in love with this tool.  Since I purchased mine I have already had two friends acquire ones of their own.  So - go ahead order one and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Since I got this &amp;#34;curlipop&amp;#34; I have used it several times. Each time I use it, multiple people ask me how I got my hair to look like it does. It curls so great, eases frizz and the curls hold forever. I can sleep on them and wear my hair curly the next morning with just a few touch ups. It takes a few times to get the hang of it, but once you get it down, you will LOVE this curling wand.</li>
    <li> This tool will make decent curls but it take a while and some pieces I had to roll around it more than once.  Sometimes pieces would slip off.  And the glove is very itchy and uncomfortable and does not provide the proper dexterity to grip pieces of hair and twirl them around the tool - which is the point of the glove - so as to prevent burns to your hands.  However, the glove was such an impediment I opted to risk it and just had some minor hot taps to my hand trying to curl my hair.  I was unimpressed with the product at large and it almost makes me want to go back to a regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and other curling irons can take up to 30 minutes to curl but this one I can use with big sections of hair with a great outcome! And the curl stays for so long! Big fan. No temp control so it gets super hot, so be careful not to let it sit in your hair too long.</li>
    <li> The wand is absolutely fantastic. My hair is so thick and long, that trying to style it takes forever. But this wand gets so hot that I can easily style my hair, very quickly and it still looks amazing. I rated this a 4/5 because there isn&#x27;t a temperature dial, and the heat protectant glove started to fray the first time I used it. Overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would recommend. Gets very hot though. Be careful and use glove that comes with it. 5 stars product.&lt;br /&gt;great price on amazaon and fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> You have to get used to how to use these. I have burned my wrist many times. The waves are great and stay in all day. I recommend using gel ahead of time. I use the hottest setting and I have slightly thin hair.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s truly amazing. It does the curls that I love. Exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s also super cute, the orange looks like candy lol. The price is also very affordable. I did curls on my mom (she&#x27;s a hairstylist so her standards are a bit high) and she absolutely loved it. She&#x27;ll be buying her own soon. Here&#x27;s a picture of her hair.</li>
    <li> It makes better curls than a proper curling iron and probably deserves a better rating but I am not patient to master the art...  it&#x27;s easy, just takes time to get your hair to look good no matter what tools you use I suppose</li>
    <li> Great product. Works wonderfully. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product. I like the waves it creates. It took a couple of tries to get the hang of it. Now I like it better than my old traditional curling iron.</li>
    <li> Says it has a ceramic barrel, but it does not look like other curling wand that I have with a ceramic barrel.  This one does not work as well.</li>
    <li> Great curling wand!  I am a beginning curler (yes, its true) and this wand helped me learn with ease!  Heats up fast, cord doesn&#x27;t tangle and its lightweight!</li>
    <li> I love the big waves this leaves in my hair! Great for loose curls!</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect size and easy to use. Once you get the technique down, it will make your hair look awesome. I get lots of compliments after I use it!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and correctly packaged. I have always had a &amp;#34;clamp&amp;#34; curling iron before so I was a little worried about trying this one. It was awkward at first but I finally got the hang of it. I have very thick, fine hair so usually my curls only last mid day with other curling irons. This one lasts all day without any touch ups.</li>
    <li> This was my first purchase on amazon. Delivery time was ok. The product was an excellent price &amp; I am very satisfied with it! I look forward to finding other good products for a great deal on amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this wand! I had tried a curling wand that had a tapered end but didn&#x27;t love the curls. I have long hair and this one gives great, even curls. It gets super hot and really delivers. I was skeptical bc it was so inexpensive, I thought it may not get hot enough. I use it almost everyday. Great purchase for the price!! A real deal for an exceptional wand!</li>
    <li> I love this I cant use the regular curly irons with the clamp I get confused as to which way to hold it in order to get it to go a certaim way this is much easier the glove fits a bit too tight and I have little baby hands but if you dont like it you can always get a different heat resistance glove. it doesnt have a temperature setting but since Im just a beginner I think its ok all in all I love it and I have used it in 2 different occasions and I got compliments both times including strangers and my bf couldn&#x27;t take his eyes off from me but then again it is rare when I do dress up lol</li>
    <li> My favorite wand I have. Be careful because it gets VERY hot, but works awesome. Perfect curls every time and you only have to let it sit for 5 seconds.</li>
    <li> The best best best clip less iron you will find for this price!! I love the way my hair looks after curling with this. Even looks good on the second or third day. I&#x27;ve tried it with long and short hair and love the results. if this ever breaks I will have no problem buying a back up. In fact I may do so just in case lol.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped quickly and it was exactly as described. I especially like that the glove is a full size, verses the 3-fingered glove that some curlers include. I tend to be clumsy, so it&#x27;s great for me. You can also use the glove on both hands.</li>
    <li> I love this it heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> best curling iron ever</li>
    <li> Sad and disappointed. I have hair to my waist. I ordered this for the length of the barrel. When I received the product it was shorter then pictured and not a full heated barrel. The black tip on the end takes away from being able to wrap my hair all the way to the tip. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> IT GETS REALLY HOT, BUT I DO NOT LIKE THAT YOU CANT CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE. WORKS WELL. WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> She wanted one of these so I searched around on here and found this one for a decent price and pretty good quality..if shes happy with it I am too</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to use this thing</li>
    <li> This curling wand works great. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the cord is a little short for me. If they had made it just one foot longer it would be perfect but otherwise it&#x27;s a great curling wand. I also suggest you look up a tutorial on youtube so you will get the results you want. There are many ways to use the wand.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Great for curling medium to thick hair. If you hair is super thick you might need a hotter wand or to keep the hair on the wand longer.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast! Much better curls than a regular curling iron! And the curl stays all day! Love this wand!</li>
    <li> I have been using this curler for about 3 months now and I have to say that it works amazingly! It heats up very quickly, and I can achieve beautiful curls with this curling iron. I think overall, this product is absolutely worth it for the price</li>
    <li> I curl my hair often, and this curling wand gets hot fast and leaves you with beautiful curls. Even though i usually prefer to use an curling wand with adjustable heat settings I make an exception for this one. Its a great curling wand for beginners (if you&#x27;re just starting to use curling wands) . Its much easier to control than a tapered one.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely worth the money.  I used to use the old style curlers with a clamp and my hair was horrible.  However with curlipops I can do loose waves as well as tight curls depending on the style I want.  It gets hot very quickly so be careful and follow directions. The heating glove is ok...I may purchase a different heating glove to protect my hand a little more.  Overall 5 stars, do not go with another curling iron besides this curlipops styling curler.  You&#x27;ll love the way your hair turns out</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to people who are first time hair curlers. The wand should be small at the top and go wider at the bottom to create a better curl/wave and this one does not. It&#x27;s to big to create curls or waves for someone with thin and fine hair. If you are like me, this is not a product for you.</li>
    <li> Love this hair tool! I have thick straight hair and it gives me exactly what I want, easy to do waves without looking over done.</li>
    <li> FALSE ADVERTISING! The original pic shows a full barrel with no black tip. Upon receiving the product, it&#x27;s significantly shorter than pictured &amp; with a black tip which takes off about an inch or so off the already short length! Horrible, VERY disappointed. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> My curls look stringy after a few hours.  I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
    <li> It does a great job, but it is a thicker barrel then the photo displays. Overall a good curling wand, and a great price.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for medium to long hair.  The glove is really helpful.  Great price for this product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love it! I was skeptical by reading all of the positive reviews, but it really does work as well as everyone says! My hair never stayed curled when I used other irons, but this one makes my curls stay in all day/night.</li>
    <li> Great product and significant lower cost than other ceramic curling wands. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome curling wand it heats up really fast and creates beautiful curl or loose waves effortlessly.It makes styling my hair very easy and I am very pleased with this product.It works better than some of my other styling tools and the price was very affordable.</li>
    <li> WOW!  My hair never hold a curl or wave and I bought this on a whim.  Not only did my hair hold it&#x27;s style for the whole day but has pretty waves the day AFTER!  I never write reviews but had to say something great about this product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> As soon as I received this item I tried it and I loved it. It&#x27;s so easy to use and the curls are perfect. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Definitely a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> decided to try this wand in place of a clamp curling iron, and am so glad I did. I prefer loose curls and waves to tight ringlets, and this wand gives me that! the curls fall out a little bit as the day goes on, but I prefer that, as they turn into loose, effortless looking waves. it&#x27;s easy to use (just be careful not to burn your hand) and affordable.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use but I think my hair it too long. It also helps if someone else does the curling but it works just as it should.&lt;br /&gt;Enough heat time is key and letting the curls cool before you handle them. And out does get hot!&lt;br /&gt;I lack creativity when it comes to my hair and I really enjoy this wand,  its simplicity and the prety awesome results I get without trying to hard.&lt;br /&gt;The glove is ok but I usually end up  leaving the little rubber cap on. I&#x27;m not that picky about the ends but I imagine a thick washcloth would do better than the glove.&lt;br /&gt;Also flat ironing my dried hair first, then curling prevents crazy fly aways. Works for me that way anyway. Plus a good heat prep for the hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter and she says she loves it. She uses it all the time.!</li>
    <li> Present for my sister in law, she thought it was &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using a regular 1\\&quot; curling iron as a \\&quot;wand\\&quot; (without using the clamp) for a couple of years now.  It never gets as hot where the clamp is, so I finally decided to get the right tool for the job.  This is great!  It gets very hot, but that is what I wanted.  A little advice if you want your curl to stay better, don&#x27;t just let the curl hang down right after you release it from the curling iron.  Hair tends to keep the shape it cools in, so if it&#x27;s hanging mostly straight as it cools, the best you&#x27;ll get is beachy waves.  This is especially true with long hair, because the weight of it is pulling down.  If you want actual curls, you need to let it cool a bit in the curled shape.  When I do my 9 year old&#x27;s hair, she wears the glove and cups the previous curl while I wrap the next one.  For the curliest curls, I pin each curl to the head with bobby pins as I go (like barrel curls), and remove all the pins after it&#x27;s all cooled completely.</li>
    <li> My Curling Iron came right on time... package was good.. and works well!!! I love it!!! Works well with thick hair... gets hot quick!!! I recommend this curling Iron to all!!!</li>
    <li> Gets really hot. Works great! Watch out or it is easy to burn the inside of your wrist when curling the back because there is not a flush built in cool tip, the rubber one it comes with I cannot really use because my hair is really long and always sticks to the rubber and tangles up into a big mess.</li>
    <li> I like the way this curls my hair, but definitely takes some getting use to. I BARELY touched my arm to it by accident the first time I used it 2 weeks ago &amp; it seems like it is going to leave some kind of scar. The scab came off, but it&#x27;s still very red. Also, the gloves that it gives you feel like a steel wool scrubbing pad you use on your dishes.&lt;br /&gt;It still makes a nice curl, which is why I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Very good product and great price</li>
    <li> Works amazingly!!! I can curl my shoulder length hair that is thick in 20-25 minutes with this!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a clipless curling iron that is not tapered or expensive for a long time! This one is very inexpensive and works great!</li>
    <li> I love this it leaves my hair perfect i can put a lot of hair to curl so it&#x27;s really fast to style my hair</li>
    <li> For the record, I am not good at styling/curling my hair! This product is so easy to use and it creates cute little ringlets, or softer waves :-) exactly the look I was wanting! Received it in perfect condition, gets very hot</li>
    <li> Makes amazing loose curls that are gorgeous! The barrel gets hot relativley fast and on some hair you can see steam coming off of your hair, but it isn&#x27;t burning!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved this styler.  She requested it for Christmas and I, of course, had to get it for her.</li>
    <li> This is great. I have horribly straight hair that just won&#x27;t curl. I cannot say that my curls last all day, but that&#x27;s probably my fault and the product I&#x27;m using. But this curling iron is wonderful. It heats quickly and get nice and hot. It has a great little removable tip for those of us who just can&#x27;t help but bump our hands with the end. I don&#x27;t use the glove, it&#x27;s not helpful for me. The price is great too.</li>
    <li> I normally wear my hair straight, so I have only tried this three times.  Pretty time consuming, but that is probably just me.  definitely requires practice.  I think anyone that is used to using a styling wand would love this product.  Gets very hot and does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t believe how well it works for the price!!! i still still continue to use my tapered wand for more controlled curls, but this wand is great for big bouncy hair.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I&#x27;ve tried other wands and this one worked as well as more expensive wands. The only thing that I noticed is that you aren&#x27;t able to adjust the heat. The wand definitely is hot enough to work well.</li>
    <li> I love the curling iron although I wish it had a temperature dial or something that told me how hot it was or will get.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand so much. I recommend this to everyone! It works so much better then other wands.</li>
    <li> Its very easy to use. You just press a button and it starts heating up instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove they include is bad quality, but you need to wear it anyways. Its very easy to burn yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a curling iron that is easy to use and makes nice soft wavy curls.  This is the perfect iron.  Regular curling irons do not even compare to this.  The glove is a must.  The iron gets very hot and helps protect your hand.  The curls look very natural and last all day long.  I have seen other curling wands that cost over $100 and this one is under $30 so you cannot beat that.  It just has an on/off switch so you just have to be careful to not leave it on and plugged in.  I am thinking of buying another one just in case this one ever breaks so I have a back up!</li>
    <li> I chose five star because it gives me the curls I exactly want! I would really recommend this to a friend or even someone else!</li>
    <li> Gets hot very quickly and must admit still learning how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;They are great!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with end cap as advertised. Otherwise works good</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. The glove works great. However, the iron is not hot enough for my daughter&#x27;s hair. I thought maybe she was doing it wrong so I tried it on her hair and nothing. Maybe a small wave. I left it there for a while too. So I tried it on my hair and still nothing. I&#x27;m rather disappointed since I really like Bed Head products.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! It heats up to the perfect temperature for long lasting curls and the thermal glove that comes w it is high quality. I have long hair and I can curl all my hair very quickly w this tool which is invaluable</li>
    <li> love love love it , makes doing your fast and fun , love that it comes with a cooling tip so you are less likely to get burned like with other styles of wands. so happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> It heats fast, curls fast, curs stay. I have long hair, a lot of it too, layered. Once in a while I color it for &amp;#34;the shine&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t use the curler everyday, maybe once a month right now while i&#x27;m in school, but when i have more free time I like to use it 4 times a month.</li>
    <li> Need to get hang of it, but easier to use than curling iron. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
    <li> This works great. Better than other brands we have purchased. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, makes great curls and very easy to use with the protective glove</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even get a little bit hot. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I have many hair styling tools, some which work pretty well, and some I absolutely hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have one other curling wand (NuMe reversed curling wand) and I really hate that thing which prompted my search for a new curling wand. I knew I wanted a wand that was not tapered and also for a reasonable price. I was worried that this 1 inch barrel would be too small for the look I wanted to achieve but I read countless reviews saying this wand is great for a wavy look which is what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my wand yesterday and had to test it out immediately. I played around with different directions as well as how much hair to curl each time. If you hairspray the sections of hair prior to curling, the curl will be tighter (also greatly depends on how long you hold the hair against the wand). I chose to spray after I curled all of my hair and finger combed it and got beautiful natural looking waves. It took me awhile because I was playing around with it but I think if I were to do this next time, it would be a pretty fast process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the fact that they have included a silicone cool tip that can be put at the tip of the wand if I want to help prevent burns to the face. Yes, the glove is a bit rough in texture but it does not bother me and it fit relatively well considering I have small hands, usually gloves that come with items are too big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this item and would recommend it to anyone as it can achieve many types of curls!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through many curling wands and this one is by far my favorite! Not to mention it&#x27;s very affordable too! My hair is about to the middle of my back with some natural body to it and this size wand gives it the perfect curl/wave I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve. Absolutely recommend this wand.</li>
    <li> Love this curler.  Very easy to use.  The glove is nice to help protect my hand.  It makes great soft curls.  Glad I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> This wand takes some getting use to!! Curling wand heats up really fast. The gloves that comes with it is pretty much useless, you can still burn your fingers if you hold the iron itself. Curls my nearly $400 lacefront really well, and it holds nicely. Happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how quickly it heats up and then how great the curls come out. Definitely my favorite hair curling product.</li>
    <li> Overall a great wand! I am not a fan of the tapered ones, I like the curls to be evenly sized all the way down my hair and I&#x27;m able to achieve this look well with the wand! Glove not really necessary but a nice addition. It is usually SO hard for my hair to hold a curl and this wand does it better than most wands and irons I have used in the past. It does feel like some heat is coming through the cracks on the orange part which isn&#x27;t so good but it&#x27;s not too noticeable. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like this curling wand.  My hair stylist used a curling wand on me that was over $100, but she recommended this one for me.  I love it.  So easy to use and the curls last really well throughout the day.  I have even slept on my hair and been able to wear it the same the next day.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the best I have ever used. Easy and fun.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great and works fast. I don&#x27;t use the glove I just try to be careful. I have recommended this product to all my friends</li>
    <li> I seriously LOVE this wand. It&#x27;s so easy to use and it creates gorgeous waves!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I have very fine, straight hair which never holds curl. The style doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it&#x27;s fun to have some waves and curl for a few hours.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it didn&#x27;t have the old-fashion clip so its taking me some time to learn how to use it with only a glove.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing ! It&#x27;s so easy to use and heats up very quickly. Leaves a natural curl. Definitely a well worth purchase.</li>
    <li> This was by far my best purchase because this curling iron is amazing. It not only is affordable but it is also reliable and gets the job done. I always get compliments on my hair after using it.</li>
    <li> I had a cheaper Remington wand with a tapered barrel that I lost on a girls trip (you&#x27;re welcome new owner) and I thought I would replace it with this product. I have naturally curly hair and this wand just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I have to hold it one forever to get a good wave and after a long day it is mostly gone. I realize that it says it gets up to 400 degrees and that might work for most people but my hair needs a hotter setting.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd curling wand I&#x27;ve purchased trying to find one that works best for me. I have long, straight, &amp;#34;thin textured&amp;#34; hair (although there is a lot of it so I would describe my hair as thick, just that the actual strands are very smooth). I like how this wand is not tapered, because I find the tapered wand too difficult to use. For me this wand has been great, my only complaint is that it has no temp control, just an on/off switch. That is a pretty significant disadvantage I think.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a curling wand, this one is perfect and the price is great! It gets extremely hot though, so be careful!</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic curling wand, ive been dying to look for an iron that is good but, not too expensive and this was a fantastic choice. it is extremely hot, so use with caution. ive tapped my finger with the iron, and ive gotten small burns but aside from that it is fantastic! recommended***</li>
    <li> The prettiest waves that lasts for days!!</li>
    <li> Works well! I have very fine hair--everything slips out of it. However, when using this, my curls stayed in tact for 2 days without any hair spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using the glove (though it is a bit itchy)--I burned myself a few times when I did not use it.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron, exactly what I was looking for. The rubber tip that&#x27;s included is a life saver, I don&#x27;t even use the glove because it has that! Curls turn out great.</li>
    <li> Bed Head curling wand is just as good as any super high end wand I have tried. The curls last for days! I&#x27;m ordering two to give as gifts to my friends.</li>
    <li> This wand is one of my new favorite heat tools. I have gone through at least 30 curling irons/ flat irons/ crimpers/ wavers and this is one of my top three!</li>
    <li> Hard to use and the curls don&#x27;t hold- my chi does a way better job</li>
    <li> Got everything as described and promptly.  THANK YOU AND WILL BUY AGAIN!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! Best hair curler I&#x27;ve had! So versatile!</li>
    <li> It was a great gift for my teenage daughter, she loves it. Loves how it curls so quickly without damaging her hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this styler. It&#x27;s super simple for anyone to use, curls last, and I love the color. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have a clamp as well. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> It works really well. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the clamp on it, and the size of the curl is perfect for me. I just wish it had a temp dial because this thing gets HOT.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling wand because a friend of mine started using it - I loved how her hair looked so I asked what she used and she showed me this Bedhead tool. So of course I bought it and I LOVE it. It gives me the exact wave/curl I want. I have long thick hair, and it takes me less than 20 minutes to curl all of my hair. It does get SUPER hot, so just make sure to use the glove it comes with.</li>
    <li> Makes great curls and waves! Easy to use, heats up quickly. Great price! I have naturally wavy hair and my curls hold for 24 hrs with this wand.</li>
    <li> Its a good curling wand. However I don&#x27;t like how it doesn&#x27;t have any heat settings and it definitely does curl but my curls did get a little lose after an hour then I had to re curl the curls. Which is not a problem if you like lose curls. Overall it is a good curling wand for its price. This is just my opinion everybodys hair is different it might work better for different types of hair I do recommend buying this wand.</li>
    <li> I love this wand.  I was really nervous to start using it because I was terrified to burn myself.  I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use the glove, and I like the rubber cap you can attach the end for beginners.  I love how the curls stay in... for a very long time.  I&#x27;ve tried to sleep in it (with very minimal hairspray), and I wake up with the curls/waves still in!  I have very straight, fine hair, and I&#x27;ve tried MANY hair products and curling irons, and everything else would have my hair straight within the first few hours.  I just ordered the 1 1/4&amp;#34; wand, for when I want looser curls; hopefully it works just as well!</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned buying this wand, for a few reasons. My main concern was that there isnt a temperature gauge because I have very THICK, LONG and STRAIGHT hair and knew I needed a pretty high temperature to get a long lasting curl. My goal was to get soft, big wavy beachy curls. I was very very surprised at the results! I only had to hold my hair to it for 5-7 seconds and the hair was perfectly curled. I curled both small sections (got very very tight curls) and big sections (got the bigger beach waves). It was so simple, so quick, so easy, so perfectly what I was going for!! The next day after sleeping on it, my hair was still just as curled/wavy as it was right after I did it. I was truly shocked. My hair has only ever been straight, I have only ever used straightening shampoo, and have only ever styled it straight with a flat iron. And this curling wand had my hair in perfectly bouncy curls/waves in just seconds. Getting used to using the curler was easy but only because I watched a good handful of youtube videos of people using wands. I highly recommend this wand, as well as watching online videos of other people styling their hair with a curling wand.</li>
    <li> Have had it for almost a month now and love this product! Makes great curls and quickly!  Don&#x27;t usually use the glove because it makes it harder to section off hair but just have to be careful not to burn yourself. Have not burned myself yet...</li>
    <li> So I bought this product hoping for the curls seen in online tutorials. Loose-ish curls, not waves. It heats up quickly, is very sturdy, and was a great price, however, it only made loose waves on me. My hair is on the harder side to curl and fine. I even used smaller sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping it tho because loose waves + a little product &#x3D; beachy hair. I am ordering a 1/2 inch wand tho. Disappointed right now, but at the same time, I know the wand will come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving it a 3 stars for loose waves ... but for actual curls I&#x27;d say a 1 or 2 star!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, and curls hair as it is supposed to. Be careful though! Burned my fingers several times. Also you have to have AT LEAST shoulder length hair but preferable longer. All in all I like this curler.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great quality for the price&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up quickly, gets hot!&lt;br /&gt;-long, swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;-resting ledge to keep barrel off counter top&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The black tip is NOT removable (just as pictured but I read some confusion in other reviews) and it stays cool- kind of pointless since you hold the wand with one hand and your section of hair with the other&lt;br /&gt;-On/Off switch- wish it had an automatic shut-off</li>
    <li> We love this curling wand! Gets plenty hot enough to give great solid curl to even thick coarse hair. Curls are a nice size, look natural. Perfect for surfer girl waves too.</li>
    <li> My hair has a hard time holding on to curl, but this makes great waves for me! I love it! , it comes with a glove and there are no heat settings on this wand. It just heats up and thats that! for the price it was well worth it! I am happy</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and I do a ton of onsite services. I wanted another wand to have in my to-go bag. This is better then the ones I spent $150 on. Worth it! Buy it!</li>
    <li> Nice product and great price!</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand... BUT I wish it had a heat temp control on it. It gets a little to hot for my hair :(</li>
    <li> Perfect size wand for my medium length hair.  The glove is a nice touch-so that you dont burn your fingers/hand which I often do bc of how short my hair is!</li>
    <li> This curling iron works really well.  I have medium length hair, just a few inches past my shoulders.  The curls come out perfect and hold well all day with a small amount of medium hold hairspray.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This iron is amazing in making beach beautiful sexy curls. Comes with a heat protection glove which comes in handy. Very great item. I love it!</li>
    <li> Produces nice light, beach wave look!  Really easy to use.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The best money I&#x27;ve spent on a curling iron in years. Where have you been all my life?</li>
    <li> Gets SUPER hot. Already burned my hand once. But it does the job!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite hair styling tool! I originally purchased this curling wand to use as a travel/spare but I fell in love with it and it has become my primary hairstyling tool. I have long, thick hair so I like that this tool gets extremely hot, as I feel the curls last a lot longer. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is I have to be careful about where I place it when it&#x27;s hot. I like to sit on the floor to style my hair and ended up burning a hole in a rug I had on my bedroom floor. That was probably more of an operator error. Overall, this is a great value and I plan to purchase another one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a curling wand, and have already mastered wavy hair with this.  It&#x27;ll take some getting used to, but, practice makes perfect! Highly highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful waves quickly and easily; great price. TOTALLY recommend! I could never figure out how to make those Victoria&#x27;s Secret waves everyone so effortlessly has but this tool makes it easy.</li>
    <li> A grat life jacket but unfortunately too small for my grand daughter.  I&#x27;ll look for an O&#x27;Brien replacement.</li>
    <li> This wand is great! Makes really nice curls and heats quickly! Plus , GREAT price.</li>
    <li> Just got this curling wand and I LOVE it! It&#x27;s perfect for what I wanted! It makes a perfect wave! I&#x27;m very pleased about this item especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my grand daughter and she loves it! Yes, I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> There is no control for heat.  It doesn&#x27;t get that hot which makes your curls not stay!</li>
    <li> Does a great job although it takes a little longer than I like for it to heat up</li>
    <li> Wanted this for beach wave hair styles, I can get a better look from my regular curling iron &amp; the small gove barely fits my hand.... Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair</li>
    <li> But i think using my Chi straightener to curl my hair is a million times easier and works alot better for me. this does stay hot the whole time but i notice that the curls start drooping right away, like literally while youre doing the next curl. i dont like to use product and with using the Chi to curl i never have to but if i want to keep the curls from this curler i would need to apply product right away after each section done! i dont like that. also, the glove makes it very difficult to maneuver, i had a hard time getting the right amount of hair in my hands because i couldnt feel how much i was grabbing and if you DONT use the glove, you get burnt unless you take 3 times as long to be careful not to touch the darn thing. using a curling iron shouldnt be that much trouble! now, some people may have no problems with this but honestly, i think i will just stick to using my Chi or a regular curling iron because these non clamp ones are totally overrated.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks....will do an update at some point.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to have a hair wand after trying my friend&#x27;s and seeing how easy curling my hair could be. Unfortuantely this one made my hair look frizzy and burned, the glove it came with snags my hair, and if you take the glove off for even a xsecond you&#x27;re guaranteed a burn that WILL blister and last for days. After frying my thumb and my neck all in one use I gave up on this :(</li>
    <li> This is the best wand I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve bought the $50-$100 wands from Sally&#x27;s before and they do not measure up. It&#x27;s simple to use, heats up quickly and it keeps the curl for a long time--maybe too well. I&#x27;ve used wands before where I have had to leave my hair on curled around on it for up to 45-60 seconds (I know.. Heat damage for sure) but this one works so well that with even 15 seconds on it, the curl is tight and lasts all day. Well worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It works amazingly and shipped very fast. I have had it over a year now and it still works good as new.</li>
