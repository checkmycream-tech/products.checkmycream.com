<li> It is lasting as well, and you only need a little, so it is strangely heady, yet subtle.  </li>
<li> Wife loves this; a delicate fragrance definitely not over powering.</li>
<li> It is really hard to find.  </li>

    <li> I wish Shiseido would bring this back!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this; a delicate fragrance definitely not over powering.</li>
    <li> This is a classic, warm and rich, very feminine, heavenly fragrance which I have not owned, unfortunately, in a while.  A soft floral with a tiny hint of spice.  You will get lots of compliments on this one.  It is lasting as well, and you only need a little, so it is strangely heady, yet subtle.  If you have used L&#x27;Air Du Temps by Nina Ricci and liked it, you will love this.  It smells very similar, but is definitely the nicer of the two in my humble opinion.  This just smells more expensive.  It does not have the sweetness of Nina Ricci.</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent and have used it for about 40 years.</li>
    <li> been wearing it since 1977...love it.</li>
    <li> ....this was an awesome purchase and delivery....thank you for all you did to make my Birthday special....</li>
    <li> This is more to the old Shiseido I used to wear.  I don&#x27;t know if my mind is truly gone, or if I remember another fragrance!!! I love the softness, feminine fragrance.  It does however, last all day.  I also have used this on cold days as well as warm days.  When the wind blows the fragrance just makes me feel so peaceful.  Its not an overpowering fragrance, its is soft and a little goes a long way.  I have had several complements on how &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; it smells, how there but not.  Will buy from this seller again...</li>
    <li> It was a lot stronger than I remember and much woodier smelling. There is a familiar scent from the original but it&#x27;s just way too strong. When I originally owned it it had a very light scent not overpowering like it is now and I always got compliments when wearing it, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been trying to find it again.</li>
    <li> Wish the fragrance held longer.  But still like it.</li>
    <li> This perfume is a perfect day time scent.  I have used Zen for over 30 years, and still love it today.  I get plenty of compliments from my hubby and friends.  Ladies have stopped me to ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing!!!  So it&#x27;s fun to wear for that reason alone but I recommend Zen to young and old alike.  Amazon shipped in record time. The whole transaction was very efficient!!! Enjoy!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Zen Classic by Shiseido for 40 years and it is my trademark scent.  It&#x27;s light and elegant and doesn&#x27;t shout &amp;#34;I&#x27;m wearing cologne.&amp;#34;  People ask me all the time what I&#x27;m wearing and I like that it&#x27;s not the scent of the moment.  NEVER stop making it!</li>
    <li> Have worn this since I was in my mid teens. I still love this scent to this day (+40 years). The bottle is pretty and it last a long time. They redesigned the label, but this is the original artwork that I prefer. A favorite in the Fall/Winter. It&#x27;s a bit too strong for warmer months.</li>
    <li> I forgot how much I love this product.  It is really hard to find.  Smelling it again brings back awesome memories for me.  It is so light and subtle.  Shiseido has amazing products.  Especially skin care.  But the fragrances are not overpowering like many fragrances today.  It is expensive but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this book. It told me things I never knew!</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the perfume</li>
    <li> Great, just how I remembered it. Still the same after thirty years.</li>
    <li> I always had to get a friend to purchase this product for me in Toronto, Canada, now I can do it myself. I have been using this product since 1970. I think that tells you how much I love it. I forgot to mention that my daughter and my step daughter purchase this product as gifts for me. They know how much I love it. It was amazing too that I could order the Moody Blues C.D&#x27;s on Amazon, I may not order a lot or often but I will be using Amazon again. My daughter uses it all the time and told me to try it.

    <li> My mother in law loves this perfume so we buy it for her every time she runs out! Pleasant fragrance !</li>
    <li> I got it for my Mom and she loves it</li>
    <li> I have used This Zen Classic for more than 30 years.  It is my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; .  It is light yet lasts all day.  I could only fine it on line.  The clerks at Macys say they don&#x27;t make it any more--I bought 3 bottles-just in case!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cologne (the perfume is just TOO strong)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for over 20 yrs and its my most favorite scent. I was so happy to find it on Amazon! I haven&#x27;t been able to find it @ the big stores where I used to buy it for yrs now.</li>
    <li> This is the only scent I love.</li>
