    <li> Love the versatility of this palatte, but I&#x27;m afraid to use it a lot because it&#x27;s limited edition and I don&#x27;t want to use it all! I have brown hair/eyes with fairer skin and I always get compliments on my eyeshadow when I use this.</li>

Great color and pigmentation. a must for any beauty enthusiast.</li>
