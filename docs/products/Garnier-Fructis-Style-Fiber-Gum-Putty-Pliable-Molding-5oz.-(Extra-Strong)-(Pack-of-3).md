      <li>great product, best way to buy!</li>
      <li>So I am very pleased to say that with your product I achieve the best results I ever have had.</li>
      <li>Great price as compared to what you would pay in the store.  </li>
      <li>Works great...</li>
      <li>Good stuff that has been discontinued on shelves in stores.</li>
      <li>It works good and after my hair air dries I just squeeze it in my hand to take out that crunchy look</li>
      <li>Found it on Amazon with FREE SHIPPING!!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Love this!  </li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Since I have been unable to find this product in any stores, I was happy, happy, happy when I found it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>so glad to find int on Amazon</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and it is my favorite putty.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find it on amazon.</li>
      <li>love this product</li>
      <li>so glad I found it on line.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m an actor and performer, and needed something that will hold for many hours while sweating under stage lights.  </li>
      <li>As for how it works, kinda like a &amp;#34;super gel&amp;#34;  I prefer the putty  ones more</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product and they stopped making it.  </li>
      <li>It washes out easily, and it has never been sticky or or drying to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I find this stuff easy to use and it works well for me.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have a really strong sweet/floral scent</li>
      <li>It is extremely strong and will hold all day, however it doesn&#x27;t have a stickiness once it dries on your hair</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is transparent and gives some degree of thickness to my baby fine</li>
      <li>It works great to keep my hair back</li>
      <li>If you have short, spiky hair this works great.  </li>
      <li>This putty is easy to apply, has a pleasant fragrance, easy to style, and an average amount put into the hair can keep its hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I might start using it to spike the kids hair for special occasions</li>
      <li>and then it is nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I was in love with what the discontinued Aldi product Shique Styling Gel did for my hair and keep trying to find something similar without any success - styling that lasted more than one day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as Royal Crown Hair Dressing (which I&#x27;ve used before, and is more of a hair &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34;), but it is certainly easier to work with and washes off hands faster after applying.  </li>
      <li>I think it is by far better than what they have on the market now.  </li>
      <li>For some reason, local pharmacies and stores in my area no longer carry this product, so I was pleased to find it was available online on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is for men, but thought I would give it a try and it works a little better than some I&#x27;ve tried, but still not just what I wanted, but better than nothing.  </li>
      <li>I am a shower, blow dry and go kind of girl.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed this product for years and loved the opportunity to get the former larger size via Amazon since Garnier now sells it under the new name &amp;#34;Fiber Spikes&amp;#34; for more money and a smaller amount of product.  </li>
      <li>So thank you very much</li>
      <li>I can just dampen my hair the next day and it seems to reactivate, without adding more.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it is no longer produced/available in stores.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy this product because it DID NOT keep my hair soft and playble.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t love my short hair without this hair product.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine fly-a-way hair with absolutely no body without it.</li>
      <li>The consistency is a little different than the other kind they make but it still is a great deal.</li>
      <li>Strong enough for my curls, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy.  </li>
      <li>I hope it continues to be available in the future.</li>
      <li>This is not sticky and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a much fuller look.</li>
      <li>I have tried oh so many other products with no results even close to this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years after trying out other hair putty products.  </li>
      <li>This is the exact same product and the three pack I ordered were plenty fresh</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly gooey like some, doesn&#x27;t leave an obvious residue in your hair (don&#x27;t use too much!)</li>
      <li>I use a little to help my fine hair stay in place and hold a hairclip.</li>
      <li>so I am guessing they were probably old stock when the name changed.  </li>
      <li>However it did work very well for other people, so I might have done something incorrectly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Love this stuff. Unfortunately it is no longer produced/available in stores. I use Axe forming putty now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years after trying out other hair putty products.  This putty is easy to apply, has a pleasant fragrance, easy to style, and an average amount put into the hair can keep its hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an actor and performer, and needed something that will hold for many hours while sweating under stage lights.  It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as Royal Crown Hair Dressing (which I&#x27;ve used before, and is more of a hair &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34;), but it is certainly easier to work with and washes off hands faster after applying.  For some reason, local pharmacies and stores in my area no longer carry this product, so I was pleased to find it was available online on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend because this product is hard to find where we live.  She uses it every day to make her curls stand out.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> If you like hair gel than go with this product, otherwise use pomade. This product also doesn&#x27;t hold short hair well.</li>
    <li> I go back and forth between having a short spiky pixie cut and longer hair, and when my hair&#x27;s short this is THE product for me.  It is extremely strong and will hold all day, however it doesn&#x27;t have a stickiness once it dries on your hair and it doesn&#x27;t have a really strong sweet/floral scent so would work well for both genders.  I have enjoyed this product for years and loved the opportunity to get the former larger size via Amazon since Garnier now sells it under the new name &amp;#34;Fiber Spikes&amp;#34; for more money and a smaller amount of product.  This is the exact same product and the three pack I ordered were plenty fresh so I am guessing they were probably old stock when the name changed.  Take advantage if you like (or want to try) this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and it is my favorite putty. And it is the only one that works for me.</li>
    <li> Since I have been unable to find this product in any stores, I was happy, happy, happy when I found it on Amazon! I hope it continues to be available in the future.</li>
    <li> My hubby has been using this for years. He loves it. We buy it all the time. Works great... I might start using it to spike the kids hair for special occasions</li>
    <li> I am ordering this item because, for some reason, my local sources aren&#x27;t carrying it anymore. I use a little to help my fine hair stay in place and hold a hairclip. I put it on wet hair, and it&#x27;s a little crunchy until I comb out. Then it&#x27;s just what I need -- body and texture.</li>
    <li> I find this stuff easy to use and it works well for me. The consistency is a little different than the other kind they make but it still is a great deal.</li>
    <li> The name Fiber Gum Putty sounds pretty tough. The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is transparent and gives some degree of thickness to my baby fine&lt;br /&gt;hair.  It washes out easily, and it has never been sticky or or drying to my hair.  I can use less hair spray after using this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t enjoy this product because it DID NOT keep my hair soft and playble. However it did work very well for other people, so I might have done something incorrectly.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product and they stopped making it.  I ordered it while I still could.  The jar lasts a long time for me.  I have curly hair and use it to help keep the frizz away.  It works good and after my hair air dries I just squeeze it in my hand to take out that crunchy look and then it is nice and soft.</li>
    <li> great product, best way to buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year or two. It gives me lots of lift. I am a shower, blow dry and go kind of girl. This is not sticky and you don&#x27;t need much. It smells wonderful too. I can just dampen my hair the next day and it seems to reactivate, without adding more.</li>
    <li> love this product it&#x27;s not sticky on hair and can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore ,so glad to find int on Amazon</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and I love it! I have very fine fly-a-way hair with absolutely no body without it. So I am very pleased to say that with your product I achieve the best results I ever have had. I have tried oh so many other products with no results even close to this. So thank you very much</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I could not find it at any grocery stores or CVS or Walgreens...I wm so glad I found it on line.  It gives my hair a much fuller look.</li>
    <li> It works great to keep my hair back</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why Garnier stopped selling this stuff.  I think it is by far better than what they have on the market now.  I was glad to find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price as compared to what you would pay in the store.  As for how it works, kinda like a &amp;#34;super gel&amp;#34;  I prefer the putty  ones more</li>
    <li> I was in love with what the discontinued Aldi product Shique Styling Gel did for my hair and keep trying to find something similar without any success - styling that lasted more than one day.  This is for men, but thought I would give it a try and it works a little better than some I&#x27;ve tried, but still not just what I wanted, but better than nothing.  I wear my hair short with bangs on my forehead and want something that gives a little fluff after being combed out.  I just can&#x27;t figure out why some of these companies cannot come up with a formula similar to Shique styling gel (that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune).</li>
    <li> Love this!  Strong enough for my curls, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy.  Replaced my Redken WHipped with this product.</li>
    <li> If you have short, spiky hair this works great.  It&#x27;s not overly gooey like some, doesn&#x27;t leave an obvious residue in your hair (don&#x27;t use too much!) and basically does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t love my short hair without this hair product.  It is the only thing that works for me.  I was so frustrated trying to find it in the local stores.  Found it on Amazon with FREE SHIPPING!!</li>
    <li> Good stuff that has been discontinued on shelves in stores.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve used in my hair for several years now and I see no reason to change that.  Basically it just keeps your hair from getting frizzy/puffy/fly-away, keeping however you styled it in place with no visible trace of use.</li>
    <li> The only gel my husband likes!</li>
