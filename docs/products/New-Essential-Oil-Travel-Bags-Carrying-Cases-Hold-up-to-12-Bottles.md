    <li> Perfect.  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel!</li>

    <li> Love this little travel bag. It is not only a cute little bag but is perfect for transporting my essential oils for &amp;#34;Raindrop Therapy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The stitching is strong. No unnecessary gaps in the fabric. The zipper glides very smoothly, even around the corners. Very impressed about that, as many bag zippers tend to get hung up on corners. There is also a little carry strap on top of the lid that is very hany. I use a carabiner to loop through the little bags handle and then hook the carabiner around anything I&#x27;m carrying, like my pants loop, the neck of my scrub or blouse, the loop or handle on my accessory bag, or just whenever I can hook it and it be visible, enabling me to see that it is physically coming along for the ride.&lt;br /&gt;On the inside, the first 3 rows are divided into 9 sections (great for the Raindrop Therapy oils) and there are no divisions in the 4th back row, allowing you to store other items or other oils. I like putting extra folded tissues or napkins in that row.&lt;br /&gt;I am purchasing another one to keep my favorite travel oils like Lavender (duh, lol), Lemon, Grapefruit, and my favorite blends.&lt;br /&gt;Hpe this helps!</li>
    <li> Love it, fits every different size bottles in it!</li>
    <li> Perfect to carry my small collection of oils. I only have about 9 in there, but they fit well. For 12, you may have to stuff it a bit. It&#x27;s much smaller than I anticipated, which is a plus!</li>
    <li> This little bag is perfect to carry a few oils in my purse.  Works just as described.</li>
    <li> good quality.  Use it for my essentail oil bottles - holds 5ml and 15 ml bottles.</li>
    <li> Quality but too small for what I wanted. Just right for carrying a few oils for a weekend get away.</li>
