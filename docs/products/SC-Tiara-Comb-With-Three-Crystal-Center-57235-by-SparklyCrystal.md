    <li> This was for a halloween costume.  It looks even better in person.  Very cute for a costume or for a child.  Probably works better on thicker hair as the comb might slip threw fine hair too easily.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Haven&#x27;t gotten to use it yet. Got it for my wedding ut had to postpone it as our aunt passed &amp; her services were scheduled for the same day.  Tiara Comb With Three-Crystal Center 57235</li>
    <li> Very pretty but much smaller than expected and not suitable for my requirements. Will return and look for a more suitable item.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 3 y.o. dtr who loves to play dress up. Althoug I knew it was not a \\&quot;toy\\&quot; tiara, I did not expect it to be as pretty, heave and well made as it is. I give it 4 stars because the comb does not grab well. Now it sits on top of my dtrs dresser.</li>
    <li> Extremely small &amp; over priced.</li>
    <li> I always wear small tiaras but I thought this one was bigger because it looks like a normal sized tiara in the pic. I liked the design so I thought I was going out on a limb and I failed to read the dimensions. It is very small but I still love it. It blings and is comfortable to wear. Go</li>
    <li> Wow! This was really pretty. I wore this to my wedding. small but big enough to make a statement!...Mrs. J. Culbertson</li>

    <li> I used this crown to run a half marathon in Disney.  It is just the perfect size for a little extra bling.  I would advise using bobby pins to securer the comb in your hair.  I didn&#x27;t use any and the crown would fall out when I looked down.</li>
    <li> I bought these for fun with my sisters to sit aroud and drink wine. Very nice quality.</li>
    <li> Very pretty for a doll.  But, I did want it for a friend&#x27;s birthday.  I will mail to my niece who is five.&lt;br /&gt;The picture looks much larger than actual size.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter to wear in her hair for Halloween. She did and has worn it many times since. It is sparkly and pretty and stays in her hair pretty well as long as it is up.</li>
    <li> This was ordered to compliment a ballet costume.  It was perfect.  Didn&#x27;t look cheap or chintzy one bit and was the ideal accessory.</li>
