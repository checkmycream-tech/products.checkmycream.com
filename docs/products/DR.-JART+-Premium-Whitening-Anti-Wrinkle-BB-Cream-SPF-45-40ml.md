      <li>I probably don&#x27;t need to do that, but if you&#x27;re like me and you still feel like BB cream is conceptually a bit too close to foundation, it&#x27;s a good way to ease yourself in.</li>

      <li>Nice, smooth, excellent coverage that lasts all day.</li>

      <li>A bit darker for my light completion, but looks great during the summer when I&#x27;ve gotten some color in my face...</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>But, as the Sephora consultant explained, it &amp;#34;warms up&amp;#34; on your face and somehow adapts to your skin.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it is amazing.</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>This is a one stop product and it is amazing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just amazing. I can wear this alone or with other makeup, I love it. It goes on smooth, moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
    <li> This balm doesn&#x27;t cause any irrigation on my rosacea prone skin. It covers the red spots naturally. I like to SPF too as I sunburn easily.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it is amazing.  My skin looks better and my makeup looks smoother.  Since it is tinted I actually don&#x27;t use foundation just a bronzer.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have found. I developed some sort of rosacea or allergy to the sun, the dermatologist did not know. I could not tolerate any sun screen and all creams would worse my skin condition. I started using this product two years ago after a make up artist applied this on my face in sephora.  and I need it, it has been my treatment. I can  not leave my house without applying this become my face turns red and itchy like having an allergic reaction. By the way, all the products the dermatologist recommended did not work and I just wasted my money. I&#x27;m in my early forties and my skin still looks very good thanks to this product.</li>
    <li> This product feels so light on the skin and lasts a LONG time. Covers rosacea good too.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite B&amp;B foundation that I use every day. It covers lightly, the way I want it to so it looks natural.  Cheaper than Sephora from some of the Amazon retailers. Plus using Prime for shipping gets it to me faster.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. Great coverage, great texture. I will never use foundation or other tinted creams again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally non-plus by most cosmetics but this made a big difference in my skin.  Great color, I won&#x27;t need foundation.</li>
    <li> Not to heavy coverage. Smooth and silky. Feels good on your skin! Love that it also has an spf. The pump helps you modify how much you want to put on.</li>
    <li> I have been using this BB Cream for around a year and really like it. I find that the coverage is good and love that it provides a SPF of 45. Typically you only get a SPF of 30 with most BB Creams and foundations. I have a fair, pinky complexion and the color is good for me.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for this product because it is the only Korean BB cream that has not made my skin itchy after extended wear. If you have sensitive skin, this might be a good choice for you. At the end of the day, my skin still feels soft and moisturized, instead of dry and irritated like with other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried. My skin is light-medium and although it goes on rather pale and gray, it matches quite well after oxidizing and seems to be a nice neutral shade (not too pink or too yellow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finish is dewy, which I like, but it does seem to wear off quite fast as a result. Setting it with powder helps it last longer. Nevertheless I will continue to repurchase because it is so hard to find a BB that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this before and what I got in the mail this time is a different product. It is different from what I ordered from here in January and different from what is sold in Sephora. There are no ingredients listed on the back. This product is incredibly oily and has no coverage. I have some of my old left and applied it to the other side of my face there is a stark difference. I have taken pictures of the items. I was satisfied the last time I purchased this, but I am really disappointed this time.</li>
    <li> Really awful finish, looks cakey and names me look sickly.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;d hoped the product was available in a slightly darker shade, but its application is seamless, and as promised delivers even and flawless coverage. Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural redhead pale. This BB Cream is too dark, for me. I&#x27;m able to get away with using it now that it&#x27;s summer, but I have to take extra time to make sure I&#x27;m blending well... For half the price, I like Misha M Perfect match a lot more. I will be going back to that brand. I still gave Dr.Jart 3 out of 5 because I think I would really like it if it were lighter in color. The finish is very natural and I love the high SPF.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage on this.  It&#x27;s enough to even out my red spots and not look cakey.  I have very fair skin and the color adjusts to me perfectly.</li>
    <li> Simply the best BB cream I have found/tried/bought.  WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER.  I FEEL THIS STRONGLY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is my third repurchase of this product, and my first from amazon.  I am writing this review because i think the packaging has changed in the last year.  I was initially worried that the new packaging didn&#x27;t match the tubes I bought from sephora, however, a quick look on the sephora website showed an updated design for this product that matched what I received from amazon.  Product (it&#x27;s the only foundation/bb cream product I use now because it fulfills my needs better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried)...especially for those with dry skin and fair skin with warm undertones.  It initially goes on slightly gray, but somehow blends seamlessly with my skin within a few minutes.  The spf is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Uhmmm, this stuff is amazing!!! I have tried numerous BB Creams and nothing has ever come close to satisfying me the way this does. Pump is great, color is great, texture is great, packaging is great, arrived fast. I cannot rave enough about it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> As a sufferer of skin cancer, I find it very important to use a product with &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; blocker SPF.  This product contains those -- titianium dioxide and zinc oxide.  But the finish is incredible.  Yes, I do use some light powder on top of it.  But I went to a very large beauty store and compared this to Dior and other high end products and this beat them all hands down.  I&#x27;ve been using religiously for about a year and it never breaks me out -- and I am on acne medication!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I originally got it in my Birch Box and loved it so much I had to buy a bigger tube! It goes on easily and makes my skin look amazing! I love the coverage and I barely use my foundation anymore.</li>
    <li> I have tried many BB creams, this is easily my favorite. I have used BB creams by Tarte, MISSHA, and Skin79 as well as multiple tinted moisturizer. I want coverage and protection without layering on products. This product&#x27;s color, texture, coverage, and smell are all top notch. It is closer to foundation than tinted moisturizer.  I have fair skin with discoloration and blemishes and this product does a fabulous job of covering everything without looking or feeling heavy. It also easily lasts 12+ hours on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> This my 2nd time buying this beauty balm. I had recently tried Bobbie Brown foundation and my face felt vey greasy all day. I have since thrown it away to go back to Dr. Jart. This gives me superb coverage that is so lightweight it feels like no makeup at all. At 59 I thought I would need more coverage than this would give me. I was wrong...this is perfect</li>
    <li> When I used this product previously, it lasted a long time and came out smoothly. This time, I noticed that the tube was different but didn&#x27;t think much of it, until the contents ran out within a few weeks. Not only that, but I had to take the tube apart to get the remainder out. I&#x27;ve had this issue with other products before. You look at the container and think you&#x27;re getting good value for the money. Then, you find out that the container is designed to give the illusion that there is more inside it than there is. Of course, the price doesn&#x27;t go down. The BB cream itself is good. It used to be one color for everyone, but has changed to being available in Light and Medium.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I had been using Trish McEvoy&#x27;s beauty balm for the past two years because my roommate worked at Blue Mercury and would bring it home for free.  TM&#x27;s BB retails for over $75 for 1.7 oz.  This stuff works just as well, for half the price -- really creates a smooth look, not greasy, and does the best job at blending with my pale winter skin tone!  I add a little bit of powder after to set, and this stuff stays shine-free and smooth for the whole day.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used any Dr.J products before but decided to try this one because of the spf and moisturizing properties.  However, much to my surprise, It is dark tan, doesn&#x27;t absorb easily or quickly and when rubbed against a white towel left a film of product on it with an uncovered spot on my face where it  had rubbed off.  I had cleaned, toned and applied serum prior to the balm which perhaps explains the poor absorption, but the color would not be effected.  In view of the other good reviews, I can only surmise that most users want a darker foundation than I do.</li>
    <li> I found this BB far too light, and I don&#x27;t have tan skin. I think \\&quot;Buff\\&quot; usually describes most of my foundations. This didn&#x27;t match at all. It&#x27;s lightweight, if that&#x27;s your thing. I don&#x27;t like putting on extra coats though.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend.  My skin looks exactly the same though.  The woman who recommended it is only 33 years old and has flawless skin to begin with and so, possibly, I was hoping that mine would turn out flawless as well.  Ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product. It has great SPF.  Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I really like this beauty balm. It goes on easily and covers and protects with a 45 SPF. My biggest issue is with the tint. It shows. So blending is imperative if you don&#x27;t want to go out looking as though you have make up on.</li>
    <li> Totally hooked on this.  It gives me layer-able, light weight, natural looking coverage with SPF 45 protection.  It evens and moisturizes my skin, and the color adapts to my skin tone in summer or winter.  I haven&#x27;t needed to wear foundation since I found this. I&#x27;ve been wearing it exclusively for almost 2 years now.  It never causes breakouts, and I have dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> This bb cream doesn&#x27;t cover a lot. Perfect for the day for a fresh look. The only problema is that this bb cream doesn&#x27;t, very good</li>
    <li> This is not the true Dr. Jart Beauty Balm.  I also have used this product for years, and this is a fake.</li>
    <li> I really like his products I have only been using for a short time but will not be using anything other than Dr. Jart.  It surpasses anything above its&#x27; price range or near its price range.</li>
    <li> Great coverage without being super heavy. It looks kind of heavy when it first goes on, but simply use a cosmetic sponge to blend, then it blends right in. I&#x27;ve already gone through at least 4 tubes of this BB cream and have never found anything better. Hydrating and good for my super sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best BB cream I have used. It really blends into the skin instead of sitting on top, and evens out your complexion. I would definitely recommend it... it&#x27;s worth the cost!</li>
    <li> Love this forever and ever. Period. The end. Never sunburn with this, just the perfect amount of tint and glow. LOVE!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. By the end of the day my face gets pretty oily with it on, but that happens with all foundations I&#x27;ve worn. The color is great (I have fair-medium skin) and the pump is great. I love that it has SPF -- that&#x27;s why I specifically bought this brand. I like to wear this when it&#x27;s hot and sunnier out.</li>
    <li> Goes on so easy, wears well all day and looks and feels wonderful!!</li>
    <li> It easily makes you look ashy. I am fair skinned and if I have the slightest amount of sun on me, this product makes me look ashy. The whitening effect is too much. I do appreciate the feel of the product and it covers imperfections great. Just wish the color was better.</li>
    <li> Fantastic BB cream for normal to dry skin. Buildable full coverage. Mineral sunscreen. I keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Jart BB cream from Sephora for the past 2 years, and I absolutely love it-- it&#x27;s my favorite foundation! However, because my local Sephora was sold out, I decided to order online. The product I received here is NOT the same product. There is a VERY strong perfume smell (almost like the cheap &amp;#34;Oil of Olay&amp;#34; perfume scent from drugstore products). The creme seemed to apply the same as usual, but within an hour I had a headache and burning eyes from the perfume scent. DON&#x27;T order from here!!! Now I&#x27;m going to try to find the legitimate product again. . . even if I have to have Sephora order it for me. . .</li>
    <li> I really love this BB cream. The only downside is that it makes the area around and on my nose break out. I&#x27;m trying to work against this by cleansing my face at the end of the day with a clarisonic brush and then applying proactive. Hopefully this helps unclog my pores and reduces the break outs. I really think it&#x27;s worth the effort because this cream makes my face look absolutely radiant. It covers up blemishes and supplies broad spectrum sun protection. It can be a little greasy when first applied but I find that it tends to absorb into your skin throughout the day leaving a blemish free face. If you REALLY dislike the greasy feel in the beginning, you can dab a little at your face with a tissue. I hope this helps! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  way  too  drying  for  my  &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin .</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled with this stuff. Don&#x27;t know that I will ever use regular foundation again. This gives a fresh, bright, even color, I only use a dab of concealer where I really need it. I can see a difference in my&lt;br /&gt;Skin even when I don&#x27;t have it on. Will rebuy as long as it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;On the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several BB creams, and this one is by far the weirdest and most wonderful. It seems weird that everyone can use the same color -- and the cream looks funny and too light at first when you test it on your hand. But, as the Sephora consultant explained, it &amp;#34;warms up&amp;#34; on your face and somehow adapts to your skin.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it is amazing. With just a dab of this, my skin looks naked -- but somehow smoother and more radiant. I also like that although it has SPF, it&#x27;s not chalky at all.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days and have also noticed -- though this might not be Dr. Jart&#x27;s doing -- that the breakout that was threatening to come out on my chin has retreated. This is the only new thing I&#x27;ve done, though, so I am inclined to give her (or him!) the credit.&lt;br /&gt; I mix it with a bit of my usual DDF moisturizer (which also has SPF, which I notice adds a bit of chalkiness), because I don&#x27;t like too much makeup. I probably don&#x27;t need to do that, but if you&#x27;re like me and you still feel like BB cream is conceptually a bit too close to foundation, it&#x27;s a good way to ease yourself in. It also, of course, stretches out the product, which is admittedly a bit pricey. My moisturizer is no less expensive, but somehow it feels ... more virtuous? I don&#x27;t know. Anyway, it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years now. I think the price it worth it, specially since it last for a while. I like the fact that it moisturize my skin, it could be used as a foundation and it has such high SPF. Definitely great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to BB creams and tried a few OTC ones but I heard very positive reviews about Dr Jart+ and had to try it. I am very pleased with the product and it leaves my skin looking flawless and feels so very soft. It is definitely worth the money. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I did not become a fan of the Dr.Jart&#x27;s BB creme, but it was good enough to use the whole tube (and it lasted forever - I guess six months of everyday use). I can&#x27;t figure out what is it that I expected and it did not deliver. The quality was good, the coverage just right and the tint adapted well to my skin tone. But somehow I don&#x27;t want to buy it again. It just wasn&#x27;t anything special - just and average fine BB creme.</li>
    <li> Not the same as what is sold in other stores.  This one seems like a knock off..very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and would definitely order it again. The only issue I have is with the labeling. I&#x27;ve ordered this from other places before and while the look of the packaging is the same, this one was labeled as &amp;#34;Blemish Balm&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;beauty balm.&amp;#34; I hope I&#x27;m not using a knockoff or old product. It seems to be the same as the others.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this product. It is a little more like foundation than tinted moisturizer, but it spreads very easily and still looks pretty natural. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all. I definitely don&#x27;t feel like I look &amp;#34;cakey.&amp;#34; I do think it has improved the overall appearance of my skin. A couple times I have caught myself in the mirror and thought &amp;#34;hmmm my skin looks good today!&amp;#34; I actually still put a regular moisturizer on after I wash my face, then I put a thin layer of this on, again because I don&#x27;t want to put too much on and look cakey. But overall I am a big fan, I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Good product, probably works with most light colored skin types. Evens out complexion. Light coverage. Some will need to put powder over it. Does not make me break out or anything and I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample and fell in love with it.  I ended up purchasing the full size one from Amazon.  I love the product, I&#x27;m olive toned, and it&#x27;s not too light on me, it adjusts to your face well, and I use it as a base, primer, almost for my light foundation.  I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t break out with this, which is a miracle.  I love it.  The only DOWNSIDE is that the bottle is a hard plastic... which I hate.  Once you get to the end of the bottle you can squeeze it like tooth paste to get out more.  You&#x27;re stuck pounding it on your counter.</li>
    <li> I went to Sephora asking for some samples of sweat-proof foundation. When I posted on thie message board, a user recommended this. I tend not to like BB Creams very well, because they give almost no coverage. But I was willing to give a try. So I got a sample of this from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t like this BB cream. There are a few reasons why. First, this comes in only one shade. It claims to be for every skintone. But I don&#x27;t think it really is. The cream itself is almost a greyish color. When I first applied it, it looked AWFUL. It basically made me look like I was dead. Given a little time, it did adjust somewhat to my skin, but I&#x27;ve had much better color matches with other foundations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd, I would describe this as sheer to light coverage. It is definitely NOT medium coverage. Due to a genetic disease, I have a lot of redness and small bumps on my face. They make me self-conscious, so I like to cover them up. But I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m wearing a ton of makeup. Even after applying two layers, you could still clearly see the redness under the makeup. Even then, it looked thick and cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think that this is way overpriced. In my opinion, it&#x27;s not even mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are someone who needs very little coverage, I would recommend this BB cream. But if you have anything you want to hide, this simply won&#x27;t do the trick. You are better off looking elsewhere. I will probably end up throwing away the sample, and will not purchase a full-sized bottle.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel great. Dare I say that it makes me glow? Much better than most of the other BB creams I&#x27;ve tried. It provides good coverage but still maintains the nice sheer quality that is the hallmark of a good BB cream. Love it!</li>
    <li> The quality was good, however i have suspicion that the product i received was fake, since the tube has slight differences when compared to both the new and old tubes. The color i got was medium-deep when the description upon ordering was the light-medium color. overall the quality is still better than some drug store brands but Im unsatisfied because i got the wrong shade and am very skeptical about whether mine is a fake or not</li>
    <li> Love it! It complements my skin tone. Like the SPF which makes me feel safe to go out with it on without sunscreen on my face. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this product. Not what I ordered. Seems fake.</li>
    <li> I sampled many BB creams and Dr. Jart+ Premium was my favorite. I wanted something that did not make my skin look or feel oily and this one did the trick. Since they also only come in one color, this one seemed to look best on my skin tone. I&#x27;m medium to light skinned.</li>
    <li> This beauty balm is an excellent foundation.  It covers well and doesn&#x27;t accentuate fine lines.  I had to apply two coats.  I assume it could also be used as a single layer underneath foundation.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I just turned 40, and have never worn makeup other than eye-makeup. I never liked the feeling of wearing base, for it feels so heavy and finding the right color seemed impossible. This is so light and has the feel of silky moisturizer that I look forward to putting it on. It blends into your own color, so no exact match is needed. More importantly, it is in fact a silky moisturizer packed full of nutrients that my skin needs. In just a week, I noticed a difference in the feel and look of my skin. A little goes a long way with this product, so the price is more than affordable.</li>
    <li> Hmm... I bought a tube of this from a local retailer and it was great, it even seemed to help with my acne and skin tone.  However, the one I bought here seems to be causing breakouts!  Not sure what the deal is there.  It could just be somethign in my body is different, or maybe this one on amazon isn&#x27;t quite the same as the one I bought local????</li>
    <li> Greasy!&lt;br /&gt;Hardly any coverage. After I put it on, I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had anything on my face (by looking) - but my face sure was shiny!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinique&#x27;s BB Cream does sooo much better.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years during the winter months.  My skin tone has red splotches, and is so pale and uneven once my tan has faded.  Dr. Jart&#x27;s perfectly covers my pores, and evens my skin tone.  I hope I never have to live without it!</li>
    <li> lightweight, color matches perfectly and it is an all-in-one. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST foundation/BB cream I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> My only daily product.  The best!</li>
    <li> Perfect is you have a pale pinky complexion. The formula is more full coverage, but has a nice skin like feel once it dries. I am more on the dry side and this leaves my skin feeling supple most of the day and I love the SPF 54- as I live in the hot bright desert.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this BB creme. I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and it is perfect for my combo skin.</li>
    <li> Be careful because it oxidizes, changing the color slightly darker than the photo lets on. I neither disliked or liked this product aside from the fact that the oxidized color matches my skin tone rather well. Doesn&#x27;t have great coverage in comparison to other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> You need light fairly neutral skintone and dry skin to LOVE this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do fit this description and it works great for me.  Very skin-like.  Solid medium coverage - more than a just a tinted moisturizer.  Dewy finish - sometimes too dewy for me.  I use powder over it - especially in afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is hard to describe.  It comes out this weird grayish/brown/taupe color.  When applied, it looks ashy and completely wrong color.  It takes 5-10 minutes to adjust to my skin.  I&#x27;m a pretty neutral NC15-20 and this looks great on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous broad spectrum physical sunscreen - a must for me!</li>
    <li> Great beauty balm! Blends well and enhances my complexion.</li>
    <li> Love the feel and creamy texture. The color is extremely light, but blends well when topped with blush / bronzer and / or powder.  I&#x27;m able to wear my favorite moisturizer underneath without any problems. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the &#x27;grey&#x27;  appearance as many have reported, perhaps because I keep my skin exfoliated. Love the SPF protection!!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to be the one and only, best of all time so I could stop experimenting and wasting money.&lt;br /&gt;However, I just looked bad in it... Then I decided to mix half and half, one pump of this and one of what I had been using (Clarins) and that is just perfect for my complexion.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected after reading about BB creams.  No shimmer, hid nothing, not worth it when there are so many other really good products by Stila.</li>
    <li> This BB Cream completely changed the way I wear make-up.  This is a one stop product and it is amazing.  I no longer have to use a primer, concealer, or foundation.  This is the perfect color for most skin tones (I am very fair as I&#x27;m a redhead) and evenly covers and smooths out my skin.  I use it under my eyes and it&#x27;s the best concealer - doesn&#x27;t crack or anything as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes you look very natural - not cakey like some foundations plus it has SPF in it!!  I am so glad I discovered this product - it is now a must for my make-up bag and has eliminated many other products!</li>
    <li> I used this all summer in Texas sun and had super sun protection.  It is a little light for me, so I put just a bit of darker BB cream.  Lovely, dewy finish and stays looking great all day.  I really love this product.[[ASIN:B004WO9EDY Dr. Jart+ Premium Beauty Balm SPF 45 PA+++ Premium Beauty Balm SPF 45 PA+++ 1.4 oz]]</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I love r/skincareaddiction&#x27;s favorite products :)  Worth the price</li>
    <li> I originally got ahold of this BB as a deluxe sample from Sephora. I loved it so much that I had to order the full size product here on Amazon. I have fair, freckled skin that is normal/combination, and a few very minor acne scars (they&#x27;re very faint, I don&#x27;t think others even notice but they drive me insane). The coverage that this provides is outstanding without looking cake-y. It glides on smoothly and very little is needed. The best part is that it evens my freckled skin, which so many products just cannot do. I have tried inexpensive BB creams and they just do not cut it. The price is steep, but this product is worth the splurge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-flawless coverage&lt;br /&gt;-goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t cake&lt;br /&gt;-visibly evens skin tone&lt;br /&gt;-looks wonderful alone or under foundation&lt;br /&gt;-SPF 45&lt;br /&gt;-very little is needed per application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive (but worth it)!</li>
    <li> Love love love.  I usually use mac studio fix powder only. But found that it came off really fast and didn&#x27;t do much for under eye darkness. So I tried this and put my powder on over it. Omg my face is flawless. I will never again not use this amazing stuff where has it been all my life. I&#x27;m a pretty light makeup wearer so this isn&#x27;t heavy at all. I use this as my base coat.</li>
    <li> Perfect quality though the package was a bit damaged upon arrival.</li>
    <li> Product as promised. Would buy again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I ordered Dr Jart Beauty Balm, and instead received Dr Jart Blemish Base.  Why?  I like the product I received, but don&#x27;t understand why this occurs.  I really wanted to try the Beauty Balm.  I cannot honestly comment on how the Beauty Balm works.  Can the merchant resend the correct product please?</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I haven&#x27;t worn anything other than mineral foundation in years. This covers nicely without feeling heavy.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and break out easily. I didn&#x27;t read the ingredient label before purchasing. Afterwards I saw that oils and comedogenics are in the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;At first the makeup looked really  nice. It felt a bit heavy and greasy, but I thought, well, if it looks good I can get used to it. As the day went on my face just felt more greasy and the makeup looked bad. I also started to look a bit orange, which sucked it didn&#x27;t look like that when I first put it on.&lt;br /&gt;It also caused my skin to break out. I stopped using it, let my skin heal, then tried using it again just to be sure. Yup, the makeup was causing pretty bad pimples.&lt;br /&gt;It might be great for people who have dry skin, but not those of us with oily skin. Wish this coulda worked, but I guess it&#x27;s just not for my skin type.</li>
    <li> After trying a few BB creams, this is my favorite. A little pricey but it goes a long way and you can layer for intensity or coverage. I also use it under and around my eyes and tap on any red marks I might have. Gives skin a dewy golden look without being greasy,</li>
    <li> The tint looks good on face and it is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;However, I wish the package is not covered by the hard plastic and the pump has a better design. It is hard to pump out and tend to waste a lot at the end because you cannot efficiently squeeze it out. But maybe it is a strategy to get you buy more...</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. She loves it. Not greasy and she doesn&#x27;t even wear face powder any more. Just uses this.</li>
    <li> I really love the way this product makes my skin look and feel. It helps me avoid needing additional make up/cover up on my face. The only problem I noticed was that it smells awful ... And since I rub it all over my face, naturally i put it on my upper lip area below my nose. I am surprised no one else mentioned the smell. Maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m a no fuss make up girl, and this product is so simple to use and drastically improves the evenness of my skin tone.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t last very long time</li>
    <li> A bit darker for my light completion, but looks great during the summer when I&#x27;ve gotten some color in my face... Great texture, really loved it.</li>
    <li> Provides good coverage, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts!  You can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  I ordered the product because of its high SPF and wondered if it would be &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; on my face.  I&#x27;m pleased to say it is not .  My only negative is about the container.  It&#x27;s difficult to know when you are running low in time to order a replacement tube.</li>
    <li> if you don&#x27;t want a full coverage, then go for this one. It has a high sun protection factor which is great for the summer months.</li>
    <li> I spend enough money on beauty supplies that I am a Sephora VIB member and I also am a birchbox subscriber. I am a fair skinned (and I mean, as white as they get), 27 yr old female with clear skin. I have never sought or wanted a huge amount of coverage, just something to even out my skin tone that blend well and not dry out,get cakey. For this reason I never use real foundation, and only ever have liked bare minerals and Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer. My issues with both was that the SPF was not high enough (if you want your skin to look good, obviously you want an SPF everyday, even if you live in a no-sunshine state area like myself). I always have gotten compliments on my skin from women in my life, and have been asked by strangers what I use because my skin looks \\&quot;dewy.\\&quot; Anyways, I have to say I now rank this one above Laura M. and bare minerals because it has the high SPF content. So now I use this one during the winter months, and in the summer I go back to bare minerals because my skin gets too greasy in the summer. Regardless I always put a moisturizer on first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if BB cream is really that different than a tinted moisturizer- I think the title is just more of a fad/trend. But this little bottle actually goes a long way..I only use a small tine pump on each cheek and one small one on my forhead and rub in with my fingers, and then I am good to go! I think that if you want something with more coverage, this is not for you. If you are darker skinned I am also not sure if this would do much for you. If you have fair skin with some red spots, it is in my opinion the best out there. It may cost more money, but your skin is an organ worth protecting/preserving...and your face will be the first to show aging...so I think it is money well spent!</li>
    <li> Great product. I get loads of compliments on how beautiful my skin is...</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!  It has just the right amount of coverage without feeling weighed down with shellac.  It does not make me breakout, and it also has the added benefit of a light SPF.  This stuff is amazing.  I started out buying it at a local high-end cosmetics retailer and became immediately hooked after my first use.  I&#x27;m so excited to find it on Amazon for a more reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many rave reviews for Dr. Jart products, that I thought I&#x27;d love this for sure. Unfortunately despite everyone else who claims this is non greasy, wonderful, etc. I found it extremely heavy and oily on my skin, I used such a small amount that I&#x27;m amazed it felt so awful on my skin! I hadn&#x27;t even left the house for work yet &amp; I was already powdering my face. It was that oily!&lt;br /&gt;I think that my skin is just too unbalanced for this product.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, but it is a bit too light, almost stark white, I would think it ideal if the color was more flesh toned</li>
    <li> Only good if you have pale skin.</li>
    <li> this product made my skin look dirtier, didn&#x27;t really provide any real coverage and just left the color looking paler and like i hadn&#x27;t showered in a few days</li>
    <li> Had been using philosophy CC cream but after ready reviews changed to this. ABSOLUTELY love it.  I&#x27;m a tinted moisturizer with bare minerals kind of girl and this is great now that i&#x27;m 30+ A bit more coverage without feel like a mask.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle of this product &amp; love the way it blends into my skin.  The only downside for me is the bottle, it has a pump &amp; you can&#x27;t see when it is about empty.  It starts to not pump when it gets low but there is usually a couple months worth of application still in the container so I have to remove the pump and bang it against my hand to get some out, that&#x27;s annoying!</li>
    <li> Tested on animals if that&#x27;s a concern of yours. http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/dr-jart/_/Premium-BB-Beauty-Balm-SPF-45-PA</li>
    <li> this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used  for natural coverage and moisturizer in one!</li>
    <li> OK, so I really like this product, and would love to give it 4 or 5 stars...but I can&#x27;t get any of it out to put on my face. In late February, I moved to Germany. In early February, I thought, in my infinite wisdom, &amp;#34;Oh, I&#x27;ll buy THREE Dr. Jart+ BB Creams to bring with me to Germany, because they&#x27;ll be so much cheaper in the States.&amp;#34; So I spent ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS on 3 tubes of this stuff, and so far, two of them have faulty pumps. The makeup is there. I just can&#x27;t get to it. FAIL. As you might have surmised from my injudicious use of all-caps, I am NOT HAPPY. Oh, and now it&#x27;s been 3 months so I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> I like this product and have used it before.  It works for me in winter when my skin needs a bit more moisture.  I really hate the pump tube in comes in.  The pump stopped working but I continue(going on 3 weeks)  to get product by taking top off and using it that way.</li>
    <li> 5 STARS***** If I could, I&#x27;d give it 10 stars. This product is amazing! I received this in a gift bag, but never before heard of it. However, my sister is a makeup artist, &amp; believes in trying any brand at least once; it might be exactly what you are looking for. Don&#x27;t be afraid to step out of your makeup comfort zone. So I said what the heck and gave it a shot. I knew this was awesome immediately! My skin is pretty clear but, I&#x27;m 33 and I have some mild signs of aging. My tone isn&#x27;t completely even, and my pores aren&#x27;t big- but they aren&#x27;t small either. My eyes can often look tired from a highly stressful and demanding job. I don&#x27;t need a lot of makeup, so I&#x27;m a big BB cream fan. I fell in love with Dr. Jart+ Premium Beauty Balm. After I&#x27;ve applied a small amount my entire complexion looks smoother and brighter, my skin tone appears even- without using any other corrective product. The feel of the BB is like I&#x27;m wearing nothing at all. A little goes a long way. It stays put for at least 7-8 hours with only 1-2 touch ups. The finish is matte but it looks natural. I&#x27;m not exaggerating this, you will NOT regret purchasing this stuff! It&#x27;s a must have. I am so happy to have found something that does exactly what I need. I really hope this review has helped. Nothing I have tried can even come close to being as good as this... I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this BB cream but the reviews were generous so I gave it a go. I&#x27;m happy I did. I could not fathom how a tinted moisturizer that did not have a specific &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; would look seamless on my skin but somehow Dr. Jart&#x27;s Beauty Balm pulls it off. With a family history of skin cancer, SPF is a personal requirement for any BB or moisturizer I use and that was another reason I bought the product. All in all, happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I received this with my September 2013 Birchbox.  The color is pasty tan/pink when you put it in your hand but when applied with a makeup brush it covers beautifully.  The trouble I had is my skin became very oily/shiny. Then, a couple days later I began breaking out, blackheads and whiteheads.  I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and have occasional breakouts (one or two zits) but this is like a zit apocalypse on my face, neck and chest.  The only new item I have been using is this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I will not continue to use it.  For those of you without sensitive skin you may really enjoy this product, for those with sensitive skin, may this be your cautionary tale.</li>
    <li> Why is this so raved-about?&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s got that authentic, full-bodied, viscous Korean BB cream texture (NOT a tinted moisturizer renamed as a BB)&lt;br /&gt;-instead of chemical sunscreens, it uses physical SPF blockers of Titanium and Zinc Oxide&lt;br /&gt;-dewy finish is PERFECT for double use as an undereye concealer&lt;br /&gt;-incredible ability to make dry, dull skin look amazingly lush and luminous&lt;br /&gt;-has anti-aging peptides and arbutin to brighten skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best for normal to dry skins, the shade is can fit NC/NW15-25. it is slightly whitish but this acts as a great undereye concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  If this is too \\&quot;white\\&quot; and \\&quot;grey\\&quot; for you, i&#x27;ve found that [[ASIN:B00CJTV8M4 Peter Thomas Roth CC Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Complexion Corrector, Light/Medium, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]] is nearly IDENTICAL to this one in terms of texture and ingredients (psst... it&#x27;s *also* made in Korea), AND you get 3 warmer, more golden shades to choose from.</li>
    <li> Love the high spf. universal shade works well with even my very pale skin. Lots of benfits all in one product</li>
    <li> this is the best bb cream.. It covers so well that you will find that you don&#x27;t use as much make-up.  I use Jane Iredale Pressed powder.  Dr. Jarts had caused me to use 1/2 of what I was using before.. I will definitely re-order!</li>
    <li> My most favorite mid coverage foundation. I live in Florida and it isn&#x27;t heavy or sweaty. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Sephora. I have light to medium skin with ruddy tones and bluish tones under my eyes. My daughter has extremely fair skin. We can both wear this product which is amazing in itself.  This product minimized my pores and evened out my skin tone.  This is probably the best makeup I have ever used. I was using both Lancôme and Chanel for years as well as less expensive brands.  I decided to purchase this product because I was going on a cruise and wanted something with a high SPF  This product is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Initially I used a serum with C, E and Ferulic acid under this product and I would caution against this. I had to wash it off after several hours later due to a reaction.</li>
    <li> Dr. Jarts is the best BB cream I have tried and I have tried about 5 different ones. Goes on great and is a great match for my skin.</li>
    <li> This BB cream has revolutionized my morning routine and brought a glow back to my tired, dehydrated skin.  It has spf, primer and moisturizer in one quick pump.  The silky cream glides over my skin (sometimes I use a hydrating serum - winter in New England can really dry out my face!) and with a little Bare Mineral&#x27;s face powder, I&#x27;m off! It evens out my blotchy skin.  (I definitely need the dusting of powder as my face is a little too shiny without.)</li>
    <li> So nice and smooth!  Love this product!  If I only have time for one product-I use Dr. Jart&#x27;s BB cream.</li>
    <li> Dr. Jart is my all-time favorite. I use Dr. Jart BB cream almost every day, to look pretty and to protect myself from UV damage. My freckles get darker almost immediately when I skip BB cream- that&#x27;s how I knew this BB cream has good sun protection. SPF of 45 is very high.&lt;br /&gt;Coverage is medium. Some people think I am not wearing makeup because it gives a natural &amp; dewy look. I very rarely get clogged pore with this product. I am very sensitive to comedogenic(blocking pore-causing acne) products, so I only stick to safe products. Dr. Jart is on my safe list.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is the same size as one sold at Sephora- this is a much better price. Sephora store in NYC sells at $39.&lt;br /&gt;Little goes long way- I&#x27;d say I need one every 3-4 months. I use every day.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time purchasing this BB cream and I love it for the summer. Its a sheer color, easily matching any skin tone, and light for summer wear. I use this than my mineral powder foundation on top. Bottle lasted me an entire year (granted I only wear it March -October).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands, textures and types of make up through the years and then my daughter gave me a tube of Dr. Jart Premium Beauty Balm SPF 45 - it is exactly what my skin is perfectly suited for! Blends beautifully with just enough color. Wish I&#x27;d found this a lot sooner!</li>
    <li> This was the wrong color -- too dark and orange. I realized after rechecking my order that this is a different product than what I usually get. It was hard to differentiate the shades by the packaging. Am more careful when I order now.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I purchased this product but I absolutely love it.  It goes on so smoothly and looks so natural.  It looks like I&#x27;m not even wearing any makeup and it feels very light on my skin.  I only use a tiny amount of powder and blush with it and that&#x27;s it.  On the weekends I only use a little blush.  I have received compliments on my complexion since I&#x27;ve been using it.  My mother even tried it and decided to buy it for herself.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now.  I try other things but always come back to this.  Covers well, perfect neutral color and sunblock.  You don&#x27;t need much.  One pump is plenty.  Never looks heavy or caked.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and the coverage but this particular shade has a bit of a yellowish undertone which sometimes doesn&#x27;t blend well with my skin tone.  I would definitely purchase another dr jart bb but it might be worth it to try the colors in person.</li>
    <li> So I forced my poor husband to compare the half of my face with the product and the one without.  He really hates these tests, but he didn&#x27;t mind this one.  He picked the product side easily and said it looked more even and smoother.  In the end that is all I want in a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also went on smoothly and was not greasy.  I love not needing an extra SPF product.  No real fragrance ( I hate smelling like fruit or flowers from different products.).  So I love this so far!</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Jart because it &#x27;s so smooth and creamy and makes my skin glow and look soft. It&#x27;s not cakey, and I don&#x27;t have complexion issues so I am not worried about color correction, but it does help even out everything. I love it because of the SPF</li>
    <li> I got some of this in my Birch box and fell in looooooove. Such a good product!</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews and watched the demos I was very excited to recieve this in the mail. When I first applied I did notice the grey cool tone everyone else has mentioned on here. It also seemed that the overall color was a couple shades lighter than I am, and normally I am pretty light, but with summer and not wearing makeup at all anymore I&#x27;ve become tan. At first I was disappointed because of this, but after I used my own powder to set it, it looked pretty great! It felt natural and light, and covered so much! And evenly! Which was the main reason I wanted a good BB cream. Another added plus was that throughout the day it didn&#x27;t fade, separate, or get oily around my nose, which my other expensive makeup brands have done (I&#x27;m looking at you Makeup Forever). The fact that it has spf 45 is wonderful too since I hate tanning and the thought of melanoma. Overall I have to rate a 4 out of 5, only because it comes in one color, and it&#x27;s a bit shiny unless you set it.</li>
    <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal products and I am used to using a much lighter colour when it states that the pigment is for fair complexion.  I am also accustomed to a much lighter feel of a B.B. product, but I suppose that is because it doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen in it.  I read several positive  reviews on this B.B. cream, so I decided to try it.  I apply my B.B. cream mixed with my moisturizer so it isn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;thick&#x27;.  When I mixed this with my moisturizer it still maintained it&#x27;s thickness.  I imagine that the high S.P.F. of 45 had a lot to do with it. This has more pigment than I care for.  My other B.B. cream is white and turns to beige upon application, but when I wipe in on my towel , it. doesn&#x27;t leave a beige mark. I notice that this has a lot more beige pigment in it especially when I wipe it on my towel almost reminding me of makeup but much more dilute, however, still a little bit bothersome to me.  I have ruddy skin and what I was looking for in a B.B. cream is something to hide the redness when I blush. which is frequently. This is kind of beigish and I haven&#x27;&#x27;t seen myself blush in the mirror yet. I do know that I will use up this tube over the summer on the occasions that I will got to public places where I may become redder., but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My everyday face cream.  I am fair and the color is a good match for me.  This is not foundation but I find the coverage just enough for most days.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It goes on nicely and matches my skin tone well no matter if I am tan in summer or pale in winter.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before splurging on Dr Jart&#x27;s premium BB cream, because it *is* expensive. I switched to a drugstore brand and quickly learned how fantastic Dr Jart&#x27;s really is. I went right back to the best. It gives me excellent coverage and a nice, near-flawless look without being heavy. I&#x27;m satisfied with the moisturizing and sunscreen properties. One tube lasts me several months because it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to give me the coverage I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: 58 years old, fair not-too-dry skin (my natural tone is beige rather than pink). I&#x27;ve got some red marks, age spots, sun damage and dark circles that need covering. I live in a non-sunny climate and am outdoors in the rain quite a bit. This product stays put! It doesn&#x27;t crease up or emphasize the lines around my eyes and lips, and looks as good at the end of the day as at the beginning. As long as I continue to wear makeup, I expect I&#x27;ll keep finding the money to buy Dr Jart+ Premium BB cream.</li>
    <li> This is a great product- absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It slightly evens out my skin tone, and it is one of the rare products containing sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.  It acts as a very pleasant moisturizer, too.</li>
    <li> This is the most expensive beauty product I own; I usually only use drug store brands.  Dr. Jart is worth the money.  Great coverage and it lasts all day.  I have very sensitive skin, and this product never gives me any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it is not a 5 start review is the packaging.  Getting the last bits out of the container is too difficult for the price of the item.</li>
    <li> My sister recomended to me and I now recomended to all my friends. I was not used to put on sunblock everyday and I would get sunburned very easily but now I never worry about it.</li>
    <li> I agree with Lizzie......this BB cream is very different from the Dr Jart&#x27;s BB cream you get from Sephora.  The color is not the same universal tint that was original to Dr Jart&#x27;s BB cream.  The light/med tint that is offered now is the original tint but this order had more of a yellow tint that did not match my skin.  Also the original is very smooth and creamy and blends in much better than this order.  I&#x27;m going to stick with Sephora in the future.</li>
    <li> im in love with this stuff. I purchased it for a beach trip so I&#x27;d have light coverage + SPF and it was perfect for that. I also wear it under my powder now and have gotten many compliments about how perfect and poreless my skin looks. You use just a little each time - less than a dime size amount. Goes on evenly.</li>
    <li> Not a genuine product - do not buy! This is completely different from the real thing.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product about a year ago and have been extremely pleased.  Not only does it combine a few steps, it has been wonderful for my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, it blends in perfectly with my skin tone and makes it look smooth and perfect, it hides blemishes on the skin and minimizes pores. it is on the expensive side but it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I do not get the item cause they put wrong address. I emailed to customer service, they ask me to go to payment system. I do want to try the product instead of getting money back, so I email them second time. Well, they asked me order again. They are so not responsible to their product and service. Will not try their stuff any more.</li>
    <li> This is the second tube of this product I have bought and I love it. Nice, smooth, excellent coverage that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have tried many high end foundations and formulations over the years but I think that I&#x27;ve finally found my favorite ! I initially purchased my first tube from Sephora after it was recommended to me by a consultant. He explained that it was formulated by a dermatologist and not another BB cream from some other cosmetic company. I was sceptical but allowed him to apply a sample, first he applied a moisturiser ( Allegenist face serum/oil ) and then the foundation. Initially I thought that it looked rather grey and chalky as it only comes in one colour, but with blending it just melted in with my skin tone. It looks dewy and radiant with a light natural coverage however it can be layered to give higher coverage but without the cakey look of some foundations. I am 52 so I am blessed with wrinkles and thankfully this does not settle into those lines, I have occasional hormone breakouts so I can use a little concealer on those areas when needed. Personally the price point is worth it for me and as other reviewers have mentioned the packaging can be deceiving as it is a smaller tube encased in a hard outer shell. However that said the top twists off and I purchased a long handled mini rubber cosmetic spatula and scraped quite a lot out and then I figured out that you could snap the outer shell off and cut the inner plastic tube with scissors to salvage even more from the tube...waste not want not right !! Bottom line I love this foundation and not having to agonise about selecting the right colour is a plus for me as well.</li>
