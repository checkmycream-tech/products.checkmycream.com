      <li>It made my skin soft but didn&#x27;t have any whitening affect</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions and apply the mask at night and gently rub the remaining contents after you remove the actual face mask, there will be a noticeable difference the morning after.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as other whitening masks I&#x27;ve used in the past however.</li>
      <li>This product is sure moisturizing skin and make it very soft and shin, but it does not really make skin whitening , I just got the other black pearl mask , will see if it will make skin whitening .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Moisturized by skin and felt great. I&#x27;ve never had any issue with breakouts or rash with this product. It&#x27;s great to use before date night or a night out. A quick fix for temporary glowing, soft skin.</li>
    <li> This mask is very nice. It whitens/brightens and leaves my skin very moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as other whitening masks I&#x27;ve used in the past however. I recommend using one to two masks a week. There are only ten so it doesn&#x27;t last very long :-(</li>
    <li> My skin definitely felt rejuvenated after one use.  If you follow the directions and apply the mask at night and gently rub the remaining contents after you remove the actual face mask, there will be a noticeable difference the morning after.  My skin was super soft!</li>
    <li> It does work! It hydrates my skin very well, and also does whiten it to some degrees. During the summer my skin got quite dark due to being out in the sun too often, and I tried to apply this twice a day, once in the morning, once at night, and the result is amazing. It took only about 5 days for the effect to show, and I can tell a difference when I look myself in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for those of you that needs fast result, although I can&#x27;t promise it will work on everyone, but it did the job for me.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes my skin softer and more supple the next day. It&#x27;s cold and refreshing after a long day.</li>
    <li> best product in the market for beauty mask, highly recommend! Bought this item along with other types of masks. It really does brighten skin instantaneously!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  It makes my skin glow after use and I like arbutin over hydroquinone to brighten/lighten skin.  It might have mica in it, but I really do love this more than other My Beauty Diary masks (i.e. Black Pearl Mask - I don&#x27;t get the same glow or brightening after). I&#x27;ve used this product for years; but I&#x27;m lazy and use very infrequently. So I&#x27;m curious how my skin will be with more routine use. I often put on right before sleep....more than 20mins, but my skin is ok.  Important:  It has been reported in Asia that there a FAKE beauty masks, including this brand.  So be very careful to buy from a reputable seller.</li>
    <li> Immediate brightening effect.  So luxurious.  The scent is rather relaxing as well.  Will purchase from My beauty diary masks!</li>
    <li> One mask and I instantly saw my skin whiten! Not to mention I had two small acne scars on my cheek and those faded! Still somewhat visible, but better than before!!!</li>
    <li> Delivery is on time and I&#x27;m always a fan of this product. Probably the best one in the whole series. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is sure moisturizing skin and make it very soft and shin, but it does not really make skin whitening , I just got the other black pearl mask , will see if it will make skin whitening .</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mask that would moisturize, but also lighten up the dark spots on my face. I found that this mask does both! At first, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but because of the price and reviews, I decided to try it. For the whitening aspect, I saw an instant improvement. Of course, it wasn&#x27;t a dramatic one, but it does brighten your complexion. It also gave my face a dewy look that I really liked. What really shocked me though, was how well it moisturized. I used the mask at night, and woke up the next morning with my face feeling exactly like it felt after I used it the night before. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that, and I was really happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line---- This product does exactly what it claims. It brightens, whitens, firms, and smooths your complexion. And it&#x27;s at a great price! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good moisturizing and brightening mask.</li>
    <li> It made my skin soft but didn&#x27;t have any whitening affect and I&#x27;ve used all of the packages only have one left and it didn&#x27;t make a difference never going to buy it again</li>
    <li> One of my favorite MBD masks!</li>
    <li> Used this a few times, seems to have some effect on th skin tone and glow. Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Terrific...really works!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my beauty diary a lot!</li>
    <li> It is really pretty, i Love It!</li>
    <li> Great product! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and nice smell :)</li>
    <li> My skin really loves this mask.  It makes it glowy and plump.  I&#x27;ve tried their Hyaluronic mask, and it really did nothing for me.  I have slightly dry skin that gets easily dehydrated in my arid climate.</li>
    <li> Awesome. I would buy more!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not working, the reviews has created by the company owners! it just made my face full of acne and partial spots!</li>
