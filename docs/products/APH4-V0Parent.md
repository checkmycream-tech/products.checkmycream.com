      <li>superior hand cream!</li>
      <li>GREAT SERVICE.</li>
      <li>This is very nice hand cream that I buy over and over again.</li>
      <li>hand lotion from Aphrodite is the best I&#x27;ve had for my hands and is also paraben free, which is a must for me.</li>

      <li>Nice size to carry in my car and keep by my kitchen sink for use after washing dishes.</li>
      <li>have sensitive skin, and this is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this!  </li>
      <li>The smell is very light, and it is not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon and will order again</li>
      <li>reading the label, there are too many ingredients that I cannot pronounce &amp; that brings to mind the image of chemists in lab coats, not doves bearing olive branches .</li>
      <li>Love the way this lotion makes my hands feel.</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Nice, light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling after it has been rubbed in.</li>
      <li>Its very good for dry  hands &amp; cracked fingers in winter time, smells really good , leaves your hands smooth</li>
      <li>A very clean scent.</li>
      <li>Found this on a trip years ago, was so excited to find it on amazon!</li>
      <li>Best hand cream we have ever found for truely dry skin problems</li>
      <li>The smell was also a bit of a quandary - strong to overpowering.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable buying it from here again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just nice, soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Thrilled to see that it&#x27;s available on Amazon because I&#x27;m totally spoiled to it now.</li>
      <li>I expected strong Chamomile smell with this one, but it smells just light and fine.</li>
      <li>Keeps your hand smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I live creams with a strong clear smell.</li>
      <li>good enough as far as hand creams go - somewhat thicker lotion that absorbs easily and leaves a slightly silky finish.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very mild in perfume and it keeps my hands super soft all day long, no matter what I get on</li>
      <li>But not so much impreseed about the smell.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very pleasing and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>My brother has a ready-mix plant and says this Aphrodite Hand Cream helps his hands more than any other cream.</li>
      <li>this is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever had, expensive, but worth it if you have very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I went from using Vaseline Intensive Rescue Repairing Moisture Lotion, Fragrance Free, 20.3-Ounce Pump to Eucerin (which ever one costs way too much for that super thick formula they have) to this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I much prefer an organic all natural Shea butter combined with coconut oil or jojoba oil . . .</li>
      <li>It is so soft and not greasy at all, I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>not sure why so many folks are raving.</li>
      <li>She gave me some, and WOW!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an art major in college, particularly in the glass blowing department, that does a lot of work with my hands.</li>
      <li>Wife has sensitive skin and this works wonders.  </li>
      <li>This is the only hand cream that really works.  </li>
      <li>No greasy feeling, just soft.  </li>
      <li>Makes me question just how natural this product truly is.</li>
      <li>stuff though completely amazes me.  </li>
      <li>Takes care of chapped, dry, cracking hands with almost one application, really!</li>
      <li>It also tends to come in tubs so clearly they expect you to use it a lot for a long time to get decent results.  </li>
      <li>My fingers were all dry and sore on the sensitive side (the outside) especially at the knuckles.</li>

    <li> good enough as far as hand creams go - somewhat thicker lotion that absorbs easily and leaves a slightly silky finish. staying power is nothing to marvel at. not sure why so many folks are raving. The smell was also a bit of a quandary - strong to overpowering. Makes me question just how natural this product truly is. reading the label, there are too many ingredients that I cannot pronounce &amp; that brings to mind the image of chemists in lab coats, not doves bearing olive branches . . .

    <li> This is one of the nicest hand creams I have ever used. Nice, light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling after it has been rubbed in. Nice size to carry in my car and keep by my kitchen sink for use after washing dishes.</li>
    <li> It works very well on hands that are dried out.</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE. FOUND THIS PRODUCT IN GREECE AND NOW IT&#x27;S THE ONLY LOTION I USE FOR MY HANDS.</li>
    <li> superior hand cream! Takes care of chapped, dry, cracking hands with almost one application, really! Found this on a trip years ago, was so excited to find it on amazon!</li>
    <li> Discovered this item on a trip to Florida where it was being sold at a gift shop.  Wife has sensitive skin and this works wonders.  Have been a regular user for about 8 years.  Found the price on Amazon to be less than the Florida gift shop which also sells online.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine got this on vacation in West Palm Beach, FL. She gave me some, and WOW! I LOVE it. Thrilled to see that it&#x27;s available on Amazon because I&#x27;m totally spoiled to it now. I can&#x27;t use anything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and this is perfect for me. The smell is very light, and it is not greasy at all. Just nice, soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream we have ever found for truely dry skin problems</li>
    <li> I went from using Vaseline Intensive Rescue Repairing Moisture Lotion, Fragrance Free, 20.3-Ounce Pump to Eucerin (which ever one costs way too much for that super thick formula they have) to this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, the Vaseline is almost useless during the dryer months.  It also tends to come in tubs so clearly they expect you to use it a lot for a long time to get decent results.  I do like the Eucerin and I would keep using it but after a bad experience with Amazon I don&#x27;t feel comfortable buying it from here again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff though completely amazes me.  I read the reviews for it.  I was skeptical.  I figured I had a worse problem than these people.  For a while I did.  My fingers were all dry and sore on the sensitive side (the outside) especially at the knuckles. They were actually cracked and bleeding a little.  It&#x27;s just been that dry.  So, I figured why not try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I specifically wanted something with olive oil.  It&#x27;s the cure all.  So, I&#x27;ve been using this every now and then and my knuckles aren&#x27;t even slightly dry anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
    <li> Love the way this lotion makes my hands feel. The fragrance is very pleasing and not overpowering. A very clean scent.</li>
    <li> This is very nice hand cream that I buy over and over again.</li>
    <li> This is the only hand cream that really works.  It is so soft and not greasy at all, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever had, expensive, but worth it if you have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!  Time to re-order!</li>
    <li> the best product you can find, healed problem issue from dermatologist visit</li>
    <li> This cream is nice, unfortunately I did not read the label and used it on my daughter, who suffers from eczema. It contains fragrance and made her break out horribly.</li>
    <li> I like this one. Keeps your hand smooth and soft. But not so much impreseed about the smell. I live creams with a strong clear smell. I expected strong Chamomile smell with this one, but it smells just light and fine.</li>
    <li> It definitely think it works and will continue to use it. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon and will order again</li>
