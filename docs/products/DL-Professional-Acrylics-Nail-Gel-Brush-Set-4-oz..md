      <li>Great Product, four different size brushes.</li>
      <li>and they were so cheap</li>
      <li>cheap too.</li>
      <li>They are easy to clean.</li>
      <li>use the rectangular shaped head with my Gelish pHbond as the original brush is bent too and the triangle tipped one I use for applying glitter to the ends of my nails when I don&#x27;t want to overuse product.</li>
      <li>Just drop a dab of glitter polish on and use it to spread it at the whites of my nails for a unique look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Make pretty good brushes for a beginner like myself, just make sure you don&#x27;t wait to long to clean off acrylic!</li>

      <li>The only one it is good, it is the thinnest one.</li>
      <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t see any fine print which would offer conditions for which the full set wasn&#x27;t available in accordance with the purchase.</li>

      <li>The quality of the brushes was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>worth every penny</li>
      <li>, they are worth what you pay for them.</li>
      <li>I do my own gel french manicures</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my wife, both of us believing it was a 4-piece set (as distinctly stated).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> not worth spending money on. go to a dollar tree and get better brushes</li>
    <li> Thees brushes are good for nail art not ... Other then that u should not use them to apply acrylic to your nail</li>
    <li> The brushes do not hold up using acetone, they seem to seal at the ends.  Would not recommend them to use for gels.</li>
    <li> I too was surprised to open my package expecting 4 brushes and found a single brush. The quality was actually very nice but not cool to advertise a 4 pc set and send a single brush.</li>
    <li> Great for jel nails. cheap too.</li>
    <li> Seemed nice, I misunderstood the product until I tried working with it. Not for acrylic powder. Acrylic gel I guess. Dont make the same mistake. The acrylic powder would not come out of the brushes and had to be tossed before first use was over .Better research on my part would have helped, however if you are working with gel, I&#x27;m sure they are great brushes, very fine, nice bristles.</li>
    <li> I do my own gel french manicures cause I got tired of the salons around here rushing and doing a crappy job for 35 dollars, these are great brushes and easy maintenance</li>
    <li> I ordered the Nail Gel Brush Set 4 pieces thinking I would receive 4 brushes, instead I received one brush.  This product is false advertisement. The picture is deceiving...buyers beware.</li>
    <li> Great for acrylic or gels each angle head brush does fills and sculpting with ease.</li>
    <li> do just fine..shipped timely</li>
    <li> When you see the picture of 4 brushes, that&#x27;s what you expect to receive.  My package had only one brush.  Several other reviewers had the same experience.  I sent back a message to the vendor...no reply.  They have my money and they don&#x27;t care about anything else.</li>
    <li> I just want to use them lol</li>
    <li> These are very poor quality. Bristles frayed after one use. Handles reacted to acrylic monomer even though these are labeled as \\&quot;acrylics nail gel brushes\\&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t release acrylic pearl cleanly onto nail and almost impossible to sculpt nails with these. Glad they were so inexpensive since I can only use them for dusting brushes.</li>
    <li> I normally purchase Kozinsky brushes to use on manicures but I had decided to give these a try because of PRICE FIRST, then because I needed new brushes also. I have been surprised and delighted in using them and I will definitely purchase them again.  DIANNA FROM CALIFORNIA</li>
    <li> These brush are not good at all for nails. They are very stiff and they don&#x27;t lay on the product smooth no matter what you do. I will never use these brushes again and I really wasted my money. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> these brushes are so poorly made. the bristles fall out and the brushes come apart. i wont buy them again. these brushes are made for acrylic nail chemicals. the plastic from the handles of the brushes melt when they get the chemicals on them.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the perfect little package.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, both of us believing it was a 4-piece set (as distinctly stated). Imagine our consternation at opening the box and finding a SINGLE brush. I certainly didn&#x27;t see any fine print which would offer conditions for which the full set wasn&#x27;t available in accordance with the purchase. Not pleased, nor is my wife!</li>
    <li> I suppose this would be a good set of brushes for acrylic gel, but I purchased it having regular acrylics in mind. Needless to say, there is a reason the brushes are so cheap. The seller was very good, shipped my order quickly and efficiently, and even included a free gift. Just wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted the money, however small the amount was. :/</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking that I would get exactly what I paid for. I only received one brush in the package that arrived instead of the set of four I ordered. I then emailed them and of course returned the one brush item but I was never contacted by them in any way and I will not be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> when using the brushes in the acetone and gel it seemed the bonging agent holding the bristles in place disinergrated. i expect the cheap brushes from kroger to do this but not ones labeled for acrylic and gel nails. good for nail art though.</li>
    <li> If you are able and willing to do your own gel manicure these brushes are very nice.  They are well made and designed.</li>
    <li> The brushes are too small for me to use...</li>
    <li> Item as described arrived on time!! I luv the square brush used it to apply clear gel it worked like a dream!!! Will order again</li>
    <li> This item is very cheap for me it didn&#x27;t last long so i would not be buying this again at all</li>
    <li> Okay so I know you get what you pay for so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anything overly wonderful.  But despite my low expectations the brushes still didn&#x27;t quite live up to what I had hoped they would do.  The acrylic nail gel I had stuck to the brushes and built up to the point that it was impossible to use them for more than one application.  Cleaning the excess product off the brushes also proved problematic as it clumped and stuck to them terribly. Save youself some time and money and just invest in a higher quaility brush to begin with.</li>
    <li> As described, thank you.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest brushes- they were difficult to use but I bought them thinking I might get some smaller ones for my toes (I have some nice ones but there a little big) and they were so cheap I didn&#x27;t expect too much and I wasn&#x27;t too worried that I might not like them, they are worth what you pay for them.</li>
    <li> Not really good for gel polish. Started to fall apart and leave bristles everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great brushes but the head covers were missing and they dry out easily after using the gel.  I&#x27;ve gone thru two of them already.  Probably won&#x27;t buy more but the brushes are nice if they had covers for the brush head.</li>
    <li> ok product, I really recommend all the things I rate highly I stand by them 100%!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy and so are those I bought them for!!!</li>
    <li> These nail brushes are great for anyone who likes to take the time to have professional looking nails.  The brushes are sturdy so you don&#x27;t have to worry about bristles coming out and messing up your nails.  The smaller ones are great for doing detail work.</li>
    <li> The shipping on this item was very fast and so was the deteration of the brushes!!! Only after one use the bristles on the brush expanded and some even fell off and yes I cleaned the brushes extremely well after every single nail completed. The brushes completely lost their shape and I would not recommend them to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I have not had the opportunity to test, but I think watching it will not be a problem. Price Value for very good quality product. High prices compared to brush it is very good. Shipping did not take long. Thank you. As I write will have the opportunity to test our experience.</li>
    <li> The set I received the bristles were damaged before I even opened the package. I decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to try to return. There are 4 brushes and two caps, although the caps are useless as they don&#x27;t fit on any of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the rectangular shaped head with my Gelish pHbond as the original brush is bent too and the triangle tipped one I use for applying glitter to the ends of my nails when I don&#x27;t want to overuse product. Just drop a dab of glitter polish on and use it to spread it at the whites of my nails for a unique look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11/11/14: This ended up being tossed in the trash about a month or two after purchase. The original damaged bristles made it a waste of time to try to continue to use.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but that is pretty normal with online shopping, and I&#x27;m fine with it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried them yet so we&#x27;ll see!&lt;br /&gt;The product did get to me very quickly and was exactly what the seller had described.</li>
    <li> These are JUNK!!!  Save your money!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, four different size brushes. This is a great set for every person who is doing their nails at home.</li>
    <li> The brushes are way to soft. Very hard to use.  It was hard to make designs using the brushes.  The art work would amudge</li>
    <li> I love these nail brushes. They&#x27;re perfect for gel nails and super inexpensive!!! I&#x27;m gonna try using the small vows for nails art.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality at all. Can&#x27;t expect much when it&#x27;s pretty cheap. It&#x27;s ok though. I rather sturdy brushes.</li>
    <li> the plastic from the handles of the brushes melt when they get the chemicals on them. overal it just came apart</li>
    <li> These were a good investment.  Priced right and worked well.  I would recommend these brushes. They are easy to work with and I had positive results. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> But so far I have only found use for the smallest brush when applying builder gel to make my nails.I suspect that as I get used to doing it myself, I will find uses for the other brushes.</li>
    <li> My package, unlike others, thankfully contained all four brushes as advertised. However, I got what I paid for: they are cheaply made and not pleasant to work with, though I suppose it&#x27;s do-able.</li>
    <li> Despite other customer reviews, I am quite happy with this purchase.  I have only used the flat brush so far.  I&#x27;ve had proffesional nails for 21 yrs &amp; decided at home tips &amp; gel for the 1st time. The brushes are not top of the line but I can&#x27;t complain, I&#x27;m very happy so far.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes! They work great! Exactly what I wanted! I was so happy when I received my package! I&#x27;m a happy customer! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good product.  The brushes are a bigger bristle then I hoped for</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great investment for the professional who is able to work cleanly.  The synthetic bristles work very nicely for sculpting and floating gel product and the product can be removed easily.  A great product for a small investment.  **Side Note: Please do not leave bad ratings on products just because you do not use them properly.  If you can&#x27;t clean product from the brush...  chances are great it is your fault, not the brush.  When using these brushes, it is necessary to clean them frequently, NOT at the end of a full set of nails.  If the handles melted, you are using them improperly...  Why is there chemical product on the handle of the brush when the bristles are the ONLY part that should be touching a chemical?  Work smarter, not harder; be clean and they will work for you the way they should!!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect for doing acrylic nails and they are an excellent deal! I&#x27;m so glad I bought them!</li>
    <li> perfect loved it! worth every penny</li>
    <li> The brush broke the first time I used it. Very disappointed with the quality. However at this price point I kind of expected a lesser quality. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> No Go For laying down Acrylic !!</li>
    <li> honestly to be used as far as for acrylic per say i wouldnt used them. i used it once and teh brush bushed up so much that i couldnt use it again. i used the rest of them as nail art brushes to get some use out of them</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes and they came way before expected date. When I received the brushes the package was beat up, and the brushes where so freaking hard it was unbelievable... I though someone used them already. All they are doing now is sitting in my room. Expected buyers here&#x27;s a tip spend the extra money and go to Sally&#x27;s or an actual Professional store cause I know for damn sure I will not trust these guys again!</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> guess i expected something different. but havent had a chance to use them yet. so this doesnt mean they arent acceptable but , conservative without use answer.</li>
    <li> these brushes are good except they hold the color of the gel I use so i have to really soak them to get them white again.  Good thing is the color that gets stuck in the brushes doesn&#x27;t tranfer to the new color if I don&#x27;t have time to soak them in between uses.</li>
    <li> What can I say they are brushes.  Was I impressed with them no.  I realized that I need a better quality for what I want to use hem for.</li>
    <li> Great quality no complaints.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re poorly made, came apart easily. For the price though, I guess i can&#x27;t complain too much. Took almost a month to get too.</li>
    <li> Make pretty good brushes for a beginner like myself, just make sure you don&#x27;t wait to long to clean off acrylic!</li>
    <li> Awesome fast shipping works great</li>
    <li> I bought these and have to say the price was great but gave up trying to do my own nails. But will say the brushes are of good quality</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush set.  I have &amp;#34;ruffed&amp;#34; them up a bit to see if there were loose bristles - not one!</li>
    <li> purchased as for a Christmas gift will update once I hear how they worked.</li>
    <li> I was glad I bought these extra brushes they helped so much with doing my own nails. It was a good deal</li>
    <li> Cheaply made.  The brissles fray to easily.</li>
    <li> Item was on time and exactly as described. Love it and I would recommend this product . Try it I guarantee you will like it</li>
    <li> This set is something you want for sure when your doing nails. The quality of the brushes was worth the wait. So these brushes will for sure meet all your expectations</li>
    <li> I do my own nails and these brushes do what they are supposed to do and they arrived ahead of schedule. Firm and very nice for the price</li>
    <li> I love there brushes. They are easy to clean. They work wonderfully with gel nail products. I am learning how to do my own nails and these brushes have helped make me look like I went to a real nail saloon.</li>
    <li> The brushes are not too thick, it is not exactly was I was looking for. The only one it is good, it is the thinnest one.</li>
    <li> I love the different sizes for the different needs of my nail care.Could not ask for a better selection with so few brushes--Thanks</li>
    <li> the brishes were to small</li>
    <li> The whole process went great!  I recieved the product within a few days of ordering it.  The packaging was good.</li>
    <li> The product doesn&#x27;t grab the polish well, leaves bubbles, and frays onto the skin, creating less accuracy.&lt;br /&gt;The nail salon girls have said the same.</li>
    <li> These can only be used once. They are too stiff to apply acrylics smoothly. Would not purchase these again. waste of money.</li>
    <li> Professional? I don’t think so!</li>
    <li> nail brushes fell apart after one use... waste of money. ended up just throwing product away. cant believe i paid for something so horrible, want a refund, but was told i cant have one</li>
    <li> Very fancy, cute and profetional product! I realy like this brushes! Easy to clean to! I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Brushes looked tampered. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was the picture or description when I ordered these, but I was disappointed in that I thought the handles were short...I kept them anyway but might have to still saw part of the long handles off</li>
    <li> Worked as expected. Decent quality for the price.</li>
