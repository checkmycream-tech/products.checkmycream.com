      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>Love love love, the tun is huge!</li>
      <li>Glad that I was able to get it in this size.</li>

      <li>I am so satisfied with the way my hair looks.</li>
      <li>The seller ensures it arrives safely.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I love this gel to do my twists on my hair</li>
      <li>, I might just try something else to see if I can find the perfect gel that doesn&#x27;t leave white residue.</li>
      <li>The lid on the jar came cracked and some of the product spilled out, but otherwise I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>Boy was I glad to have found it on amazon and with free prime shipping was even more pleased that I wouldn&#x27;t have to lug it home from the store.</li>
      <li>At first I believed that they did not even put the hair gel in the tub, rather just filled the box with a pile of gel and throw the tub in for good measure.</li>
      <li>Would be cool to have a pump top.</li>
      <li>It works fine.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how HUGE 80 ounces was until this gigantic container (5 pounds) arrived at my door.</li>
      <li>Its huge.</li>
      <li>I have to say, I really enjoy this product, my hair dresser suggested it, BUT order it from somewhere else.</li>
      <li>wash n go&#x27;s, for smooth edges and updos.</li>
      <li>cuz not everything is cheap on here</li>
      <li>They are both good products but for me personally this one works much better and you just cannot beat the price.</li>
      <li>Great quality of gel that lasted for a long time.  </li>
      <li>After reading so many positive reviews of this product I splurged and bough the five pound container.</li>
      <li>So if you have some of the Kinky-Curly and want to preserve that usage for special occasions, maybe you should give this item a try.</li>
      <li>At any rate, the eco styler works to an extent on my hair (I have a 4a-b mixture) not as curly as I would have imagined, but it most certainly defines curls.</li>
      <li>In fact it gives my hair a nice natural looking sheen without the oily residue.</li>
      <li>It dries nicely and just lets the natural curl show through.</li>
      <li>and this gel is the difference between beautiful defined curls and a frizzy mess.</li>
      <li>if it&#x27;s cost worthy, but I did check Sally&#x27;s website, and they don&#x27;t  even carry the 80oz.</li>
      <li>Luckily they were all wrapped in plastic.</li>
      <li>I found it best to apply this best when my hair was wet, where it could take more of a hold for me...and it did have the irritating white specks that would pop up</li>
      <li>This leads me to my last comment, I know some naturals who use Kinky-Curly and love it!  </li>
      <li>It came wrapped very nice, tight, and neat.</li>
      <li>Most of the products I use on my hair have completly natural ingredients and this one does not so</li>
      <li>The top was completely off, and the gel was ALL OVER the place.</li>
      <li>This is the only gel that offers great hold without drying my hair out.</li>
      <li>you will have to find the right amount for your hair.</li>
      <li>The hair gel works perfectly with my hair, the smell is not overwhelming, and it drys soft.</li>
      <li>It gives great curl definition but also left my hair with a bunch of white flakes.</li>
      <li>I use a leave in first and then &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; two dollops of this in, one on each side.</li>
      <li>I have not used it in the winter yet, but in humidity and hot weather it seems to do pretty well.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I was told that there are different types that may be more suited for my hair texture in this brand.</li>
      <li>First off, Ordering the gel I would give 1 star.</li>
      <li>The first time I ordered this product, it came in a box flooded with hair gel everywhere</li>
      <li>I used this on my 6 year old daughter to achieve cute natural hairstyles without heat.  </li>
      <li>Whoever packaged it decided it would be smart to put the bubble rap all on one side</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of eco styler this container last me about 7 months because I do wash and gos every 5 or 6 days.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the timely delivery.</li>
      <li>The product says the hold is 10; however it&#x27;s a gentle hold.  </li>
      <li>Amazon really needs to figure it out.</li>
      <li>I have very curly [3B for those in the know] hair</li>
      <li>I was very excited to get 80oz of gel knowing it would last me a year or two, but I was unpleasantly surprised to see 60oz of gel spread all over the inside of the package.</li>
      <li>My hair is coarse, my moms hair is soft and it works great for both of us and helps bring out our natural curl without being tacky, sticky or wet.</li>
      <li>Granted, it&#x27;s not enough, other help is needed to lay those edges down, but this is a great start!</li>
      <li>The second time the top was off again, and it was packed in a large box with only one piece of packing material.</li>
      <li>mainly I got caught up in the hype with this product, that lead to my splurge...</li>
      <li>jar of eco-olive oil because I wanted to play it safe, but the next jar I will invest in a bigger jar.  </li>
      <li>I find it to be mild enough to use for my kids</li>
      <li>The only problem I had was remembering to close the lid tightly as to not let the gel dry out which is my own fault.  </li>
      <li>thought it was going to be smaller, but totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>it holds and is not stiff or flaky!</li>
      <li>Long story short, I contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement free of charge.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff - no flaking, non-drying and holds my big hair down without having to use a scarf for reinforcement.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how HUGE 80 ounces was until this gigantic container (5 pounds) arrived at my door. Guess I won&#x27;t be buying gel for a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the gel, it smells really good and works great.</li>
    <li> Was tired of buying small ones in te store all the time so this is the solution.  Works well.  Would be cool to have a pump top.</li>
    <li> As a natural woman who hardly ever used gel due to crunchiness and flakiness, this gel worked wonders on my hair.  My natural hair texture is a 4A/B, I cowash my hair and rack this product in using my fingertips I see instant curl definition!  You can also use this product for twists, twistouts, wash-n-goes, and slicking edges too.  Besides the curl definition that impressed me, this product doesn&#x27;t leave any white flakiness nor has my hair feeling crunchy and it is also moisturizing.  Keep in mind a little bit goes a long way.  The product says the hold is 10; however it&#x27;s a gentle hold.  I&#x27;m currently using the 8 oz. jar of eco-olive oil because I wanted to play it safe, but the next jar I will invest in a bigger jar.  The price is inexpensive and even with bigger jars your saving.  This leads me to my last comment, I know some naturals who use Kinky-Curly and love it!  I&#x27;ve never used it personally, but I read the product is somewhat pricey.  So if you have some of the Kinky-Curly and want to preserve that usage for special occasions, maybe you should give this item a try.</li>
    <li> This is a good gel. It does everything that gel should do. The only problem I had was that it left white residue in my hair when I tried to wash it out. I had to shampoo my hair 3 times just to get most of it out! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy this again, I might just try something else to see if I can find the perfect gel that doesn&#x27;t leave white residue.</li>
    <li> Great quality of gel that lasted for a long time.  The only problem I had was remembering to close the lid tightly as to not let the gel dry out which is my own fault.  This gel is great doesn&#x27;t flake up like a lot of gels do and leave my hair with softness instead of crunchy hard.  This is my go to gel for daily hair care and maintenance.  I am a happy customer and would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent price for this size gel. This gel doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard and it&#x27;s perfect for wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> this still leaves my hair soft but after 2 days it starts flaking, making it look like I have dandruff.</li>
    <li> Love love love, the tun is huge! thought it was going to be smaller, but totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> It gives great curl definition but also left my hair with a bunch of white flakes. I had to stop using it. I was told that there are different types that may be more suited for my hair texture in this brand. will look into it later.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is about the best Eco gel for natural hair. It does not leave it too soft, and it is better at laying down edges than the other Eco styler gel products. Granted, it&#x27;s not enough, other help is needed to lay those edges down, but this is a great start! It came wrapped very nice, tight, and neat. Good job Amazon Prime workers&#x27;! I&#x27;m not familiar with if it&#x27;s cost worthy, but I did check Sally&#x27;s website, and they don&#x27;t  even carry the 80oz. on their website.</li>
    <li> Like this gel but not so string for my thick hair like the one with morracan oil is. but this still works pretty great</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of eco styler this container last me about 7 months because I do wash and gos every 5 or 6 days.  When  I wear protective styles the gel lasts me even longer.</li>
    <li> First off, Ordering the gel I would give 1 star. I am now waiting for my 3rd tub of it as the first 2 arrived OPEN in the box. The top was completely off, and the gel was ALL OVER the place. The first time it was really bad because I&#x27;d ordered several other items and had to wash them all off in the sink. Luckily they were all wrapped in plastic. The second time the top was off again, and it was packed in a large box with only one piece of packing material. Let&#x27;s see how #3 arrives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I have used this gel for awhile now and I LOVE it. I have very curly [3B for those in the know] hair and this gel is the difference between beautiful defined curls and a frizzy mess. I&#x27;ve used dozens [hell, probably hundreds] of other products and this seems to do the trick. I have not used it in the winter yet, but in humidity and hot weather it seems to do pretty well. I use a leave in first and then &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; two dollops of this in, one on each side. Don&#x27;t touch your hair again until it&#x27;s dry and voila!</li>
    <li> Was not sealed and was all in box</li>
    <li> The gel itself is probably one of the best gels i have ever tried. Whoever packaged it decided it would be smart to put the bubble rap all on one side</li>
    <li> This gel works very well, and as you can see this tub will last. Its huge. I use this gel for wash n go&#x27;s, for smooth edges and updos. Its thick with a hold level of 10 and its made with olive oil and its lightly scented. Cant get any better than that. And guess what no flaking.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t ever buy another gel.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the family sized version of this product and so far, it works well. I find it to be mild enough to use for my kids and it provides the hold that my husband needs for his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would not recommend that anyone use in combination with any other products. It will cause the other products to look like dandruff all over the hair. Lots of particles. Trust me, you will have to wash your hair again, before leaving home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and packaging was excellent. The seller ensures it arrives safely.</li>
    <li> I have type 4B/A hair and have had difficulty finding a styling gel that I could use a considerable amount and it not dry out my hair, have it flaky or gummy feeling. This gel does an excellent job no flaking unless i apply way to much. you will have to find the right amount for your hair. My hair is coarse, my moms hair is soft and it works great for both of us and helps bring out our natural curl without being tacky, sticky or wet. It dries nicely and just lets the natural curl show through. If you view youtube you will find a lot of reviews comparing this to Kinky Curly. I much prefer Eco Styler gel and not just because it is LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE but for my hair it also works much better. They are both good products but for me personally this one works much better and you just cannot beat the price. I have not however researched the ingredients of Eco Styler. Most of the products I use on my hair have completly natural ingredients and this one does not so if you are a stickler for natural ingredients do some research before purchasing. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love this gel to do my twists on my hair it holds and is not stiff or flaky!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product and it holds the hair great top of the line product</li>
    <li> I already loved the product just glad i can get it in an 80 ounce tub!!!! :) I will order again.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my Eco Styler Gel at the beginning of the summer and did not replace it. I tried a smoothing hold pudding I already had amongst my hair products. It had petroleum in it, but I figured I&#x27;d save money and give it  shot. BIG MISTAKE!&lt;br /&gt;Since going back to the olive oil Eco Styler Gel my curl definition is 100% better. I will remain faithful to this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> This eco style olive oil gel holds your hair in place without leaving it super hard, crunchy or with flakes.</li>
    <li> Great buy excellent gel little to no flaking</li>
    <li> I used this for my 4a/4b hair to define my curls. I dont like how hard it makes my hair though, IC Fantasia gel leaves my hair much more moisturized, but unfortunately I&#x27;ve committed to this gel til its gone, so I&#x27;ll just add some olive oil to it to soften the hold til I run out. this product is good for those doing the CG method.</li>
    <li> Bucket was open and spilled</li>
    <li> After reading so many positive reviews of this product I splurged and bough the five pound container. Now I&#x27;m regretting it because I feel I shouldve bought a smaller size to experiment with, but now I&#x27;ve committed to this giganto container. At any rate, the eco styler works to an extent on my hair (I have a 4a-b mixture) not as curly as I would have imagined, but it most certainly defines curls. I would not be purchasing another Eco Styler product again, however, especially not this size, merely because it did not provide the results I wanted, although it did provide some decent ones. mainly I got caught up in the hype with this product, that lead to my splurge...&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair a bit dry, while it may not LOOK dry, it does give it a slight crunch, ONLY SLIGHT, though. The smell isn&#x27;t horrible, and it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair at all. I found it best to apply this best when my hair was wet, where it could take more of a hold for me...and it did have the irritating white specks that would pop up and you&#x27;d have to really rub the product in fro ages to get those to go away, and I find this does not like to work well with other products.&lt;br /&gt;generally, when mixed with something else it didn&#x27;t like, the reaction was a milky, cloudy type of product that wouldn&#x27;t rub in well...&lt;br /&gt;Also, in my experience it wouldn&#x27;t seem to work at all on dry hair.</li>
    <li> I had to give this product one star because I was unable to use it. when I received my package the gel cover and side were broken and the gel spilled out. I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to using this gel.</li>
    <li> Item was great but top of container broke during shipping.</li>
    <li> No flakiness. No residrue. No build up.  Not too oily or drying. You will not lose your curls ( used this for braidouts)</li>
    <li> This is the only gel I will ever use. I am so satisfied with the way my hair looks. Everyone is always asking me how did I get my hair to look so good? I&#x27;m loving IT!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - no flaking, non-drying and holds my big hair down without having to use a scarf for reinforcement. It&#x27;s a great buy for this size, too.</li>
    <li> I ordered the black gel because it was the cheapest. I was very excited to get 80oz of gel knowing it would last me a year or two, but I was unpleasantly surprised to see 60oz of gel spread all over the inside of the package. After I had ordered this product I read that some people did receive a damaged product but I was hoping I would be an exception. I mailed the remains back for a new product and received an email stating that my new order was also damaged and I would not be receiving it. Im sure it is a good product but the packaging is horrible. If you order this, have fun cleaning up the mess.</li>
    <li> Love this gel! Glad that I was able to get it in this size. I have natural type 4 (thick, dense, coily) hair and if I use this gel on soaking wet hair and use oil then I don&#x27;t have a problem with flaking. Using it any other way leads to flaking for me. The hold is great and it does wonders for my edges!</li>
    <li> i just got this gel at my local beauty supply which is way cheaper than amazon. i just did a hair chop and been natural for 3 months so my hair is way shorter than im used to and it is very hard to style or manage but this eco styler made it easier for me to do twist out. i love it. i got the 80oz for 8 dollars at my local beauty supply so don&#x27;t rush to buy it on amazon cuz not everything is cheap on here</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 100% Naturally Curl girl, I wear wash n go&#x27;s and other styles and Eco Styler Gel is just awesome when comes to natural hair!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this gel for over a yr now at my local beauty supply store but was informed due to its weight they were having a hard time getting new shipments . Boy was I glad to have found it on amazon and with free prime shipping was even more pleased that I wouldn&#x27;t have to lug it home from the store. It&lt;br /&gt;Last a long time the size says 80 oz which on the container is actually 5lbs of gel . It&#x27;s hugeeeeeee last a really long time and for th price you can&#x27;t beat it else where.</li>
    <li> product cames on time.  product works great.  has great hold with no flaking or itching.  has nice sheen.  would purchase again</li>
    <li> I wear my hair natural short and curly. This is the only gel that offers great hold without drying my hair out. In fact it gives my hair a nice natural looking sheen without the oily residue. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I used this on my 6 year old daughter to achieve cute natural hairstyles without heat.  Thanks for the timely delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about 15 years, and still love it! It&#x27;s the ONLY one that won&#x27;t give me flakes.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEE IT! The lid on the jar came cracked and some of the product spilled out, but otherwise I am satisfied. I received it in almost 1 day.</li>
    <li> This gel is pretty thick and holds great a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It works fine.  just hates when it flakes. But it is excellent</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome and my hair maintains its softness.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great product for great value!</li>
    <li> The product is amazing! No flakes!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say, I really enjoy this product, my hair dresser suggested it, BUT order it from somewhere else. Amazon shipped it with 3 other things and the container cracked in like 5 places and half the gel was all over in the box and stuck to everything. Amazon really needs to figure it out. Look back and see every review where the product broke open and lost over half. Again Great STUFF, BAD SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> The hair gel works perfectly with my hair, the smell is not overwhelming, and it drys soft. Shipping is an entirely different matter though. The first time I ordered this product, it came in a box flooded with hair gel everywhere and I mean everywhere. At first I believed that they did not even put the hair gel in the tub, rather just filled the box with a pile of gel and throw the tub in for good measure. That is until I found the shattered lid submerged in the gel. Long story short, I contacted amazon and they sent me a replacement free of charge. The replacement has a small crack on the lid with a small amount of gel that came out of it. I&#x27;m keeping the replacement, but I probably will not be buying this gel from amazon again until they use styrofoam instead of bubble wrap to protect the tub.</li>
