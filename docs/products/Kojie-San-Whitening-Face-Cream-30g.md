    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for 3 wks. and have seen no difference.  I don&#x27;t think it works.  Will not reorder</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it compliments the soap, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the soap so I use it as a moisturizer. My only complaint is that the jar is super small for what I paid for it. Other than that, I like the cream itself so far.</li>
    <li> Used it for a week for my face and neck and I did not see any changes and this  itsi  bistsi jar (2 small for me and my money)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to buy this product again ....voila.</li>

    <li> I Been Using This Cream For About 2 Months Now &amp; I Really Didnt See A Change In My Skin Tone.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to be doing much but will continue to use until gone and see if the area lightens.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me.</li>

    <li> Great product! It nicely gives my skin a beautiful glow. And again, it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy. I will buy this over and over.</li>
    <li> 3 star because it came early didn&#x27;t really do much but, nothing bad happened, product was really small didn&#x27;t expect it to be small... If you are looking for any kind of light skin stuff don&#x27;t go for it....</li>
    <li> It only lightens when used in conjunction with the soap...</li>
