      <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer!</li>
      <li>really nice</li>
      <li>The magnified side of the mirror is nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as bright as any of the others although the magnification is fine.  </li>
      <li>The light is good (what do I know about vanity mirrors)</li>
      <li>No assembly was required, just take it out of the the well packaged box - plug in and enjoy!</li>
      <li>I paid $39, which is a lot more than the $15.00</li>
      <li>I am enjoying being able to put on my makeup again without working around glasses.</li>
      <li>so I decided to try one more time.</li>
      <li>I also have been pleased with the Zadro</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used a magnifying mirror for many many years.  </li>
      <li>best mirror (next to the discontinued three-way Clairol mirror) is [[ASIN:B0001WY3PA</li>
      <li>The mirrors are fine, but the light would&#x27;ve been really nice to have</li>
      <li>This mirror and light is nicely constructed and uses an easy to replace, full spectrum bulb.  </li>
      <li>comes with bulb..really easy to assemble</li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t want to spend $120, which you could easily do.</li>
      <li>I like the size and the look of the light</li>
      <li>I bought this from Costco and the light didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>When the mirror light worked it worked well.</li>
      <li>My wife bought one at a store, but she said the light didn&#x27;t work</li>
      <li>and you have to pry the thing a part to get to the light bulb.</li>
      <li>Instructions offer the solution to tighten the light bulb.</li>
      <li>I had one given to me as a gift at Christmas 2011, didn&#x27;t use it until March and loved it, but it &#x27;died&#x27; early.</li>
      <li>I bought it a week ago and found it very useful.</li>
      <li>Originally, I got it for applying makeup in the morning without waking up my husband.</li>
      <li>This item was nice but it is advertised as Natural Daylight Lighted Mirror.  </li>
      <li>My mirror had a scratch on the magnified side, but it honestly wasn&#x27;t enough of a big deal to return it, because the utility of this item is great.  </li>
      <li>But seriously, its a great vanity lamp!</li>
      <li>The light went out the first day.</li>
      <li>If you need this magnification and are willing to not have the light</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for and the price was right!</li>
      <li>shipping took about a week to get..was well worth the wait though..</li>
      <li>Be aware that this is a very large mirror.  </li>
      <li>I wanted one that was extremely magnified, very bright, and tall enough that I wouldn&#x27;t have to bend forward when standing at my bathroom countertop.</li>
      <li>Excellent product overall, made well, magnifies extremely well and meets my needs particularly well.  </li>
      <li>it is Not natural light but does the job, the dual sided mirror is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This was her favorite Christmas gift and I scored some big kudos.</li>
      <li>Then, I found out that the 8x magnification quite useful too especially I need to... &#x27;clean up&#x27; my brow:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The stand is nice, looks higher end than it is, heavy weight.  </li>
      <li>I can put my makeup on much easier now..</li>
      <li>and it is not enough light to put makeup on correctly.  </li>
      <li>..made really well..</li>
      <li>my sis saw it and now wants one too..</li>
      <li>The full spectrum light is appreciated by some members of my household who are a little seasonally affected.  </li>
      <li>Style is a personal thing, of course, but the clean lines of this mirror do not clash with the rest of our bathroom fixtures.  </li>
      <li>The magnification is definitely adequate to see whatever tiny thing you&#x27;re trying to see on your face.</li>
      <li>The item is nice  looking however the light is not bright enough.</li>
      <li>I use the magnified side for eye makeup the normal side for the rest of my makeup.</li>
      <li>(I believe it is 18\\&quot;), and the light seems adequate (as long as you have other lights in your bathroom).</li>
      <li>So I love this mirror, I wanted one and saw it in that BIG warehouse store only to back up and realize it was my face on the side from a   stock photo shoot!</li>
      <li>I looked at many big box stores and online sites before I narrowed it down to this mirror.</li>
      <li>do not waste your money - just buy a mirror because that is what you will end up having.</li>
      <li>Other people seem to have the same problem and either returned the light or just use the mirrors.</li>
      <li>It was larger than we expected, however that is not necessarily a bad thing.  </li>
      <li>However the light is not very bright at all</li>
      <li>I paid for a NEW item, it is NOT new.</li>
      <li>My biggest complaint is that the light (which is supposed to be working &amp; last for a looong time) did not work.  </li>
      <li>I had expected a quality product, based on the price; but when I plugged it in, the light came on for a few seconds, then went out.</li>
      <li>I am not inclined to make another purchase through a third party, only if Amazon is fulfilling the order directly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When the mirror light worked it worked well. But after about four months of use, my bulb burnt out. I did not get 10,000 hours out of it. I might have gotten about 20 hours out of it. I cannot find a replacement bulb. I am so frustrated with this product. I have gone to the company&#x27;s website and it does not directly to replacement bulbs. Not very user-friendly at all.</li>
    <li> My wife bought one at a store, but she said the light didn&#x27;t work and she took it back.  I saw it here and ordered it for her but it arrived broken. Amazon took it back with no hassel so I decided to try one more time. This time when she told me it didn&#x27;t work, I took it apart with a Phillips head screwdriver. I tightened the bulb and it worked. There are no directions to do this and I was concerned about voiding the warranty, yada yada. Other people seem to have the same problem and either returned the light or just use the mirrors. The instructions should give this little tip. The web site refered to in the instructions dosen&#x27;t work and no one answers the phone, you just get voice mails. The light is good (what do I know about vanity mirrors) It seems like a lot of hassel for what you get,though. I paid $39, which is a lot more than the $15.00 someone here says they paid. If you can find one for less than $20, buy it. If not, and you want one of these, get out the screw driver.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this mirror. I had expected a quality product, based on the price; but when I plugged it in, the light came on for a few seconds, then went out. I flipped the switch a few times, but with no luck. Also, the felt panel at the bottom was not in the best shape. And the icing on the cake was the cost of shipping it back to the vendor -- almost half the cost of the mirror! I am not inclined to make another purchase through a third party, only if Amazon is fulfilling the order directly.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used a magnifying mirror for many many years.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this one.  Exactly what I was looking for and the price was right!</li>
    <li> Sunter lighted mirror is great. It is a two sided mirror, one side regular mirror..the other side is a maginfying mirror.. comes with bulb..really easy to assemble..made really well..sturdy not cheap looking...really nice..definitely got a great deal..I can put my makeup on much easier now..my sis saw it and now wants one too..if you&#x27;re looking for a mirror that is made well and you don&#x27;t want to spend alot of money this is the mirror to buy..shipping took about a week to get..was well worth the wait though..I&#x27;m a satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I received this item on time, but the bulb and light switch was broken.  I don&#x27;t mind the bulb to be broken, but the light switch is a bit of a hassle now.</li>
    <li> So I love this mirror, I wanted one and saw it in that BIG warehouse store only to back up and realize it was my face on the side from a   stock photo shoot! HA! But seriously, its a great vanity lamp!</li>
    <li> I bought this through amazon but from a different seller.  My biggest complaint is that the light (which is supposed to be working &amp; last for a looong time) did not work.  Since I bought it from a different seller, i had to pay for return shipping (which I am not used to doing with amazon.) ..So I ended up keeping it. The mirrors are fine, but the light would&#x27;ve been really nice to have so i can see my face brighter and clearer while I primp.</li>
    <li> This mirror and light is nicely constructed and uses an easy to replace, full spectrum bulb.  With a 10,000 hour life, I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;ll be doing that, but some other lights reviewed on Amazon listed bulb replacement as an issue.  The full spectrum light is appreciated by some members of my household who are a little seasonally affected.  Style is a personal thing, of course, but the clean lines of this mirror do not clash with the rest of our bathroom fixtures.  For the price, I think this is a well made mirror.</li>
    <li> I looked at many big box stores and online sites before I narrowed it down to this mirror. I wanted one that was extremely magnified, very bright, and tall enough that I wouldn&#x27;t have to bend forward when standing at my bathroom countertop. I also didn&#x27;t want to spend $120, which you could easily do. I like the height of this mirror (I believe it is 18\\&quot;), and the light seems adequate (as long as you have other lights in your bathroom). The magnification is definitely adequate to see whatever tiny thing you&#x27;re trying to see on your face. It seems really solid in construction and I don&#x27;t expect that it would fall apart anytime soon. If you need to replace the bulb (which just looks like a standard CFL), you just take out 2 screws and lift off the front. When mine arrived it flickered, so I opened it and found a loose lightbulb (screwing it in immediately solved this issue). Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The light went out the first day. I opened it and flipped the mirror and it went out. The bulb isn&#x27;t dead... But something sounds loose to where it doesn&#x27;t stay lit anymore. Extremely dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> If you need this magnification and are willing to not have the light it&#x27;s good but if you need the light be prepare to be very frustrated. I bought this from Costco and the light didn&#x27;t work. Instructions offer the solution to tighten the light bulb. The screws got stripped trying to get them out and you have to pry the thing a part to get to the light bulb. Also it is very hard to put back together.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my wife.  It was larger than we expected, however that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Very happy with this purchase.  Well made and solid.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying being able to put on my makeup again without working around glasses. I especially like the lighting part.</li>
    <li> I can see my face now ,I have two, one at home and one at vacation house.  I also bought one for a friend</li>
    <li> I have purchased a half dozen makeup mirrors over the past couple of decades and this is one of my least favorites.  It&#x27;s not as bright as any of the others although the magnification is fine.  But it&#x27;s price beats all the others (bought mine at Costco) and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best mirror (next to the discontinued three-way Clairol mirror) is [[ASIN:B0001WY3PA Fluorescent Lighted Pedestal 10X to 1X Make-Up Mirror in Chrome]] for $150 (yikes!).  I also have been pleased with the Zadro mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that any mirror with a fluorescent bulb is superior to those with incandescent bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving this mirror to my grandson who said his mother stole it from him.</li>
    <li> Excellent product overall, made well, magnifies extremely well and meets my needs particularly well.  Very glad I decided to choose this product.</li>
    <li> It came packed in a cut-down box for another product. The actual box itself had part of the lid torn, there were 2 gashes in the box (not from shipping). Opened it up and it had hand-cut cardboard circles to protect the mirror itself. There was no piece to turn it on, just the piece a button or knob was supposed to be on. This was OBVIOUSLY NOT NEW as advertised. Then I plugged it in and it didn&#x27;t even work. No, I did not even try to take it apart and screw in the bulb. I paid for a NEW item, it is NOT new. Extremely disappointed.  I had one given to me as a gift at Christmas 2011, didn&#x27;t use it until March and loved it, but it &#x27;died&#x27; early. Thought it was bulb, but was wiring so we threw it away and thought I could get another one. This was a mistake.</li>
    <li> This item was nice but it is advertised as Natural Daylight Lighted Mirror.  However the light is not very bright at all and it is not enough light to put makeup on correctly.  The magnified side of the mirror is nice.</li>
    <li> This was her favorite Christmas gift and I scored some big kudos. No assembly was required, just take it out of the the well packaged box - plug in and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I recieved this mirror around Dec 2011.  For the price its a great buy.  The stand is nice, looks higher end than it is, heavy weight.  My mirror had a scratch on the magnified side, but it honestly wasn&#x27;t enough of a big deal to return it, because the utility of this item is great.  I love having it on my master bathroom vanity counter, the height is perfect.  I cannot find anything to complain about.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this is a very large mirror.  Unfortunately, I did  not pay attention to the size when making the purchase.  Good quality though, just too tall for our space.</li>
    <li> the bulb does not last like typical flouorescent and i cannot find a manufacturer who makes this bulb (and i was in the lighting field for years). do not waste your money - just buy a mirror because that is what you will end up having.</li>
    <li> I bought it a week ago and found it very useful. The natural daylight comes in handy because it doesn&#x27;t make my makeup look awful when I am out. Originally, I got it for applying makeup in the morning without waking up my husband. Then, I found out that the 8x magnification quite useful too especially I need to... &#x27;clean up&#x27; my brow:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product! I haven&#x27;t experienced the issue that some of the reviewers had with the bulb. It was in good shape when I got it. Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> The item is nice  looking however the light is not bright enough. I like the size and the look of the light just wished it were brighter.</li>
    <li> it is Not natural light but does the job, the dual sided mirror is fantastic. I use the magnified side for eye makeup the normal side for the rest of my makeup. the height is perfect for my vanity and it looks great.</li>
