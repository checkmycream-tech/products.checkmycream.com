      <li>We love it and item is accurate as seller specified</li>
      <li>but it does not break so easily.</li>

      <li>Cheap and will not buy again.</li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, for one use.</li>
      <li>I needed a shower camp to fit my head.</li>
      <li>They are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Free showercaps from a hotel would be better, but ya gotta get there first...</li>
      <li>I have been using the first one for a week now and still feel good as new.</li>
      <li>There is nothing special and as another reviewer said they are flimsy</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, they are good friends when you are traveling, but not for daily use</li>
      <li>We love this product so much.</li>
      <li>a deal and works great and cheap at half the Price for Sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And they are adequate size to cover my head.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I have been looking for!</li>
      <li>If you have much hair, probably won&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>Practical, useful, inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Price alone brought me to order 24 each of these colorful Helmets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>right...</li>
      <li>received 8 shower caps for a very reasonable price and they arrived early,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using the first cap;</li>
      <li>and  It didn&#x27;t last long lol.  </li>
      <li>First the color rubs off and it stains your finger and your hairline,I dont know the chemicals used in the color,but be warned.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much to the seller!</li>
      <li>Product is exactly as pictured and serves the purpose.  </li>
      <li>I really like these colorful caps.</li>
      <li>These are cute and functional, but they are not very big.</li>
      <li>Ok for last minute use.</li>
      <li>All the different colors make it kind of fun, so you don&#x27;t feel like an old lady with a shower cap on.</li>
      <li>they are so sturdy, and cute, also they come in a size large enough to fit the head of an adult.</li>
      <li>They fit, but just barely.</li>
      <li>They are large and the size that was advertised.</li>
      <li>Hotels and motels are not including shower caps in the bathroom toiletries these days, so having one or two of these on hand while traveling is a real need.  </li>
      <li>Very inexpensive item.  </li>
      <li>a lose it product and very thing.</li>
      <li>They are standard size, they fit well.</li>
      <li>much need item received in tact and appreciated  </li>
      <li>Elastic band is very springy &amp; hold well.</li>
      <li>Warm olive oil--left on the hair for 20 minutes then shampooed out--leaves coarse hair softer and shinier than commercial conditioners, a secret a friend learned from a wise grandmother and shared with me.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought the little caps.</li>
      <li>The size seems pretty generic, so it should fit unless you have some massive sized dome that you can barely get a ball cap on.</li>
      <li>They stay around your head pretty well and are definitely reusable.</li>
      <li>They are basically the same exact ones you might see in your hotel bathroom.</li>
      <li>Expect to get what you paid for with this product...cheap plastic...elastic that easily stretch out of shape and never really fit on your head</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No stars! They are cheap and smell like oil. I threw them out immediately.</li>
    <li> I use these to cover shoulder-length hair while treating it with olive oil. Warm olive oil--left on the hair for 20 minutes then shampooed out--leaves coarse hair softer and shinier than commercial conditioners, a secret a friend learned from a wise grandmother and shared with me. These caps work well holding the hair in place during the conditioning and can then be disposed of. They are inexpensive enough to use for this purpose. They arrived quickly and came with a hand-written note from the seller, ToyArama, which I thought was a very nice touch.</li>
    <li> Definitely cheap but they have worked great!</li>
    <li> Bought these to color hair</li>
    <li> These are cute and functional, but they are not very big.</li>
    <li> Hotels and motels are not including shower caps in the bathroom toiletries these days, so having one or two of these on hand while traveling is a real need.  These are supplied in bulk making it easier to just pack a couple and not worry about moisture and big, wide spraying shower heads in places that do not have hand held shower heads.</li>
    <li> Great product.  No problem with the product or shipment.</li>
    <li> These are tiny.maybe ok for a chlld.  I put them in a drawer.</li>
    <li> Covered my hair and my Shower was entirely perfect. In fact I no longer have to  wash my hair during every shower.  They are perfect.</li>
    <li> We love this product so much. It serves the purpose 100 percent. We love it and item is accurate as seller specified</li>
    <li> These shower caps are really thin and I do not think they can stands for more than 3 times bath.&lt;br /&gt;However, they are good friends when you are traveling, but not for daily use</li>
    <li> This is for someone with a shaved head. If you have hair it&#x27;s not going to cover it properly. I have to use two and even then, it&#x27;s not secure.</li>
    <li> Cheap, but good for the price!</li>
    <li> These shower caps are way too small for an adult head. They are kids size shower caps that are very thin. I needed 2 to cover my head.</li>
    <li> The cap were too small. I wear S size cloth, the caps were very tight to wear them.</li>
    <li> Its just for a vaca wear,not something that lasts.First the color rubs off and it stains your finger and your hairline,I dont know the chemicals used in the color,but be warned.</li>
    <li> These looked pretty flimsy and cheap when I first opened the package, but they are large enough to cover entire head, and then some extra to pull down in the back to help cover any hair may be sticking out. I have reused the same one several times now, and so far, is still holding its elastic. So for the price and the quanity that comes in the package, I&#x27;d say this is a very good deal. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for! I will definitely be ordering these again! These are way less than what you would find in the Dollar stores! I will be posting a video review on how these work, but for now, I am so excited about how these turned out to be! Very quick shipping too! The colors are really attractive and the fit is snug enough to lock in heat when you need it for conditioning sessions! I absolutely love these shower caps! Each one can most likely get a good 15-20 uses out of them! Thank you so much to the seller! Perfect service, quick shipping and superb product for a more than reasonable price!</li>
    <li> For the price, these caps are decnt. It works in keeping my hair dry during my shower. And they are adequate size to cover my head.</li>
    <li> Expect to get what you paid for with this product...cheap plastic...elastic that easily stretch out of shape and never really fit on your head right...keep your money...</li>
    <li> They are basically the same exact ones you might see in your hotel bathroom. Ok for last minute use.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay.  Not the strongest.  Not the weakest.  Kind of has a funky smell when the package was first opened.  I&#x27;m not planning to eat them, so I wasn&#x27;t concerned!</li>
    <li> did not even make it through one shower. but I guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> They are ok, i still have them all.  Not for big heads, sorry, but works fine. Material is ok for the price</li>
    <li> perfect for one time or for frequent use. i haven&#x27;t had any of them tear etc and def keep my hair dry.</li>
    <li> Price alone brought me to order 24 each of these colorful Helmets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife even hauled them to Kansas and gave some to her sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a deal and works great and cheap at half the Price for Sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron in Texas on May 11, 2014  Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay $3 for one shower cap, so I thought I would try these cuz even with the shipping they are way cheaper than Wal-Mart.  The plastic is thinner than an expensive shower cap, and if you have really long thick hair, these may not work for you, as they seem a little smaller than average.  But they work great for my medium/short hair.  I&#x27;m still using the first cap; over 2 months now.  I&#x27;m thinking the elastic will probably stretch out before I have to start on shower cap #2.  Nothing fancy, but keeps the hair dry, that&#x27;s all I was after.  You can always use them as bowl covers if they don&#x27;t work on your head.</li>
    <li> much need item received in tact and appreciated  They were inexpensie  and practical I am glad i can shop&lt;br /&gt;on line at Walmart as i am 80 years old and cannot get out like I used to.</li>
    <li> I  got these to cover my shoes to put in the suitcase when I pack for a trip. It keeps the polished shoes from marking my white shirts. Neat idea, no? Free showercaps from a hotel would be better, but ya gotta get there first...</li>
    <li> I brought them as a birthday present. They are perfect.</li>
    <li> Very thin. Great for covering food at a BBQ.</li>
    <li> I needed a shower camp to fit my head. All the standard ones are too big. I tried one of them and it stayed on my head, didn&#x27;t leak so it protected my hair during the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I received 8 shower caps for a very reasonable price and they arrived early,&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Product not adult size as described.</li>
    <li> I did not like the product. Caps are not good for one day.</li>
    <li> I bought these when I was looking for disposable shower cap.  I have not had any problem with these, they fit nice and do the job I wanted.  If available when I need again, will again purchase.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair -- not very thick.  These are snug but fit okay.  If you have much hair, probably won&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> I bought the 8-pack and am still using cap No. 1.  Great and lightweight, but sturdy.  They will also come in handy for travel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, for one use.</li>
    <li> Very tough plastic. They look like use and throw type but it does not break so easily. I have been using the first one for a week now and still feel good as new.</li>
    <li> Really good quality plastic shower caps. Really cheap but reusable. Best buy for the price. Even though you have to pay for shipping, still cheaper than other prime options.</li>
    <li> Practical, useful, inexpensive.</li>
    <li> They are pretty small. While I do have past shoulder length hair I still think they are pretty small... Even the regular ones at the beauty supply are larger than these... Don&#x27;t buy if you consider your hair long at all...</li>
    <li> These are cheap and small. Good for one time use.</li>
    <li> I DID NOT GIVE THESE SHOWER CAPS EVEN  1 STAR  THE CAP LEFT MY HAIR SOAKING.  IN ADDITION THIS COMPANY WILL NOT PROVIDE A RETURN.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I kept buying them locally and they were just too small.  I thought these would be better because they specifically state &amp;#34;full-size adult&amp;#34;.  They fit, but just barely.</li>
    <li> Cheap but they work. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I might get since they are reusable. However I wouldn&#x27;t reuse them myself. I use them to provide more nutrients for my scalp as suggested with coconut oil. After use these seem unable to really get clean so I toss them as I use them. For the price they still weren&#x27;t to bad so I would get them again as needed. Other than having to toss them they arn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> Cute polka dot design and great value for the price. I&#x27;m tired of using plastic bags for my head so I bought these. They&#x27;re too thin to be reusable, but for deep conditioning treatments and coloring every few weeks it works great!</li>
    <li> Great, just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  They are large and the size that was advertised.</li>
    <li> There is nothing special and as another reviewer said they are flimsy BUT I use them in the shower not for treatments just to keep my hair dry.  I&#x27;d like them a bit bigger and a bit sturdier sure, but the cost very little and they work well enough for me.</li>
    <li> These are small and very lightweight plastic.</li>
    <li> These are cheap and cute! They stay around your head pretty well and are definitely reusable. All the different colors make it kind of fun, so you don&#x27;t feel like an old lady with a shower cap on. The size seems pretty generic, so it should fit unless you have some massive sized dome that you can barely get a ball cap on. I once dated a guy with a dome that size...I couldn&#x27;t see passed it and  It didn&#x27;t last long lol.  Alright good luck!</li>
    <li> NOT A PERFECT FIT THERE TOO SMALL OF A SIZE THERE NOT A RIGHT SIZE FOR SHOWER WHEN I WOULD GO TO USE ONE FOR A SHOWER IT WOULD NOT FIT MY HEAD, MY HAIR GOT WET.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I thought I could reuse them. But they were actually too thin to be reused. I think you could only get one or two uses out of them. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I know that these caps are disposable. But since I bought them, it is so hard to toss them in the trash. they are so sturdy, and cute, also they come in a size large enough to fit the head of an adult. I really like these colorful caps. A pretty good price for as many as you get. Glad I bought the little caps.</li>
    <li> I have to use 2 of these to keep all my hair dry. I will probably use them for covering food containers instead.</li>
    <li> Definitely falling short of my expectation but not a bad one though. If its needed can buy but will be little lighter.</li>
    <li> Took like a month to ship but I guess for the price that&#x27;s fine. They are cheaply made. They were a prop for a party so we never used then as they arrived long after it was over.</li>
    <li> I rub this thing the wrong way and it gets a puncture. Cheap and will not buy again. Disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These are ok for the price,overall. But they do tear after some uses so they don&#x27;t last forever. Also I have long curly hair and if I put it in a ponytail or a bun these dont always cover my entire head and sometimes leave the roots or the back exposed about an inch , which kinda defeats the purpose of a shower cap. I wish these were slightly larger.</li>
    <li> I would love these if they did not smell so strong of solvent. They do air out in a few days, but, not sure anyone sensitive to solvents could tolerant them in the house.</li>
    <li> made jelly fish for VBS and hung from the ceiling worked out wonderful</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as pictured and serves the purpose.  Very inexpensive item.  Arrived in good time.  Won&#x27;t need to purchase again for awhile because there are 8 in the pack.</li>
    <li> Either these shower caps are too small or my head is too big :(</li>
    <li> These shower caps are very light &amp; flimsy but they work. They are standard size, they fit well. The elastic is good. I get approximately 10 uses from each one. For the low price, that&#x27;s a great deal! Will buy again</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit and not all hotels give you a shower cap!  These disposable ones will work nicely AND the colors will make them easy to find in toiletries case.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re definitely a use it a lose it product and very thing. However perfect for a use or two or travel, they hold up.</li>
    <li> Product shipped and was delivered promptly. Exactly what I expected (received more pink caps than other colours, not a big deal). Elastic band is very springy &amp; hold well. Happy with purchase.</li>
