      <li>Great conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and the smell is just amazing as well!</li>
      <li>AMAZING product!</li>
      <li>It smells so nice!</li>
      <li>Introduced to my friend and she also loved it</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t shut up about how much I love this product!</li>
      <li>Am I glad I did!  </li>
      <li>This mask restored my shine and made my hair look healthy again!</li>
      <li>Now I get compliments on how healthy my hair looks all the time!</li>
      <li>amazing price</li>
      <li>The OGX line has amazing products.</li>
      <li>I really liked this product.</li>
      <li>I bumped into someone who commented on how nice it looked.  </li>
      <li>I rinsed with warm water</li>
      <li>Makes my hair very easily manageable.</li>
      <li>I kept piling more and more on!</li>
      <li>This is by far the best mask that the Organix brand has.</li>
      <li>I washed my hair 3 times with the shampoo and then used the mask for 20 minutes with a plastic bag on my head (didn&#x27;t have a shower cap:)).</li>
      <li>and I just love it.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>the better it got</li>
      <li>Even with me using more than what it called for &amp; sitting under a blow dryer for 30mins.</li>
      <li>only had it on for 10 minutes (package suggests 20) but it still worked perfect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I was really pleased with the mask and plan to purchase one or two jars per year as a stand-by in case</li>
      <li>I run out of my favorite pre-poo/DC products.</li>
      <li>This stuff is magic in a jar.</li>
      <li>I searched other vendors and found that Amazon had the best price</li>
      <li>I was also impressed by its staying power; I wash my hair every other day, and on the morning of day three (before I&#x27;d gotten a chance to wash it)</li>
      <li>Otherwise was fine with product.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair...</li>
      <li>After using this, I didn&#x27;t need to add any curling or anti-frizz serum to my hair to get the waves that I so enjoy.</li>
      <li>, I was looking for a great deep conditioning treatment as well as something that would help with detangling.</li>
      <li>: light pink&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel fortunate to have found this product &amp; at a price I can afford.</li>
      <li>It says that for severely damaged hair you should cover with shower cap and leave it in for 20 minutes, but I only did it for 5 min in the shower and got great results.</li>
      <li>I freaked out, looked online and found out that cheap dandruff shampoo would help take some of the color out</li>
      <li>The more I used it, probably 2-3x per week for the first month</li>
      <li>It rinses out easily, leaving a mild, not unpleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>I also want to test its slip capabilities for comb/brush detangling &amp; test the claim that this is a good deep condish to use after color treating my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>use this once a week for the full 20 minutes and for 3-5 minutes after I swim or do anything else damaging.  </li>
      <li>This with the Organix Argan Oil once the hair is dry &amp; styled is a winning combination for me. :)</li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling soft to touch, I love wearing it at night and waking up with locked in curls.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite smell in the world, but it&#x27;s pretty enough and very mild.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because the reviews on amazon were all pretty much positive and it was cheap.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed on packaging but will probably look to other sellers next time around.  </li>
      <li>first time I used it, it was right after I got home from a swim.  </li>
      <li>Great smell, made my 4b/4c hair soft, but I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the price!</li>
      <li>and after I color my hair and when I&#x27;m using hot tools often.</li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner!</li>
      <li>it was delivered FAST!</li>
      <li>I could see improvement in just the first use.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I am using it</li>
      <li>I love this mask, I use it as a deep conditioner and a leave in.</li>
      <li>My hair was smooth, shiny, and soft, even without a flat-iron.  </li>
      <li>and these are my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It held in moisture and was super soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair is fine with a natural wave which I enjoy when I don&#x27;t want to blow dry my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is fairly straight &amp; fine, with highlights and it actually felt rougher, and snagly after.</li>
      <li>it became a really fragrant floral scent</li>
      <li>I had been using Moroccon Oil&#x27;s Intense Hydrating Mask with Argan Oil and it was just so-so.  </li>
      <li>(it was way too light), but it would also take out the last bit of nutrients I had in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it makes most of a difference when you use it every day or every other day.</li>
      <li>I particularly use this before</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found other products, where you get the same job for a better deal!</li>
      <li>It really makes my hair silky soft.</li>
      <li>I have very curly natural hair and this mask made my hair feel soooooo soft !</li>
      <li>After blowing it dry, though, I became a true believer.  </li>
      <li>Prior to rinsing the mask out, I lightly finger detangled my hair but the product didn&#x27;t have enough slip</li>
      <li>and I like the results so far!</li>
      <li>When I rinse it out, I don&#x27;t rinse it out completely and continue with my normal styling routine.</li>
      <li>and my hair is already at least 50% better.  </li>
      <li>My hair was soft again.</li>
      <li>I was very hopeful that this product would revive my hair back to how it used to be.</li>
      <li>This product made my color processed hair soft and shiny and the smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>After using the product for a week, my hair is SOOOO soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>It has a lot slip for my natural women</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>Hair: natural 4a, 4b and 4c color treated.</li>
      <li>my hair did not feel conditioned or soft at all.</li>
      <li>Obviously nothing works for everyone, but I can say that it didn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair and did make a noticeable difference in the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
      <li>My hair is long, and while each individual strand is fine, there is a LOT of it, so even in dry climates</li>
      <li>My color treated hair was feeling pretty rough before I used this</li>
      <li>and now it is back to its normal softness.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and left it in for 20 min and whola soft coils !</li>
      <li>I have only used it once, but I can tell a difference in how soft my hair is.  </li>
      <li>totally helped to repair my over processed and completely fried hair.  </li>
      <li>well I used this and tried blow drying my hair it would not dry!</li>
      <li>My hair usually blow drys quickly</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that my hair felt extra dry or anything, but it was not as soft and moisturized as I had hoped it would be.</li>
      <li>Let me preface my review by giving some of my vital stats: I&#x27;m a Black woman with natural unrelaxed hair (curl types 3C, 4A/B).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great conditioner.  I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I have very curly natural hair and this mask made my hair feel soooooo soft ! I was shocked because I was not expecting  this to work as well as it did. I followed the directions and left it in for 20 min and whola soft coils ! I am going to purchase the shampoo and conditioner to match.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once, but I can tell a difference in how soft my hair is.  it was delivered FAST!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling soft to touch, I love wearing it at night and waking up with locked in curls. Introduced to my friend and she also loved it and yeah. Good product.</li>
    <li> My color treated hair was feeling pretty rough before I used this and now it is back to its normal softness. It says that for severely damaged hair you should cover with shower cap and leave it in for 20 minutes, but I only did it for 5 min in the shower and got great results.

    <li> I bought this because the reviews on amazon were all pretty much positive and it was cheap. I have fine hair... when I applied this conditioner I used a lot and still could not comb it through my hair...I kept piling more and more on! I left on for about a half an hour and rinsed out...my hair did not feel conditioned or soft at all. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Let me preface my review by giving some of my vital stats: I&#x27;m a Black woman with natural unrelaxed hair (curl types 3C, 4A/B).  I bought this product at the suggestion of one of my sisters who loves the Organix conditioners.  I searched other vendors and found that Amazon had the best price so took a chance &amp; ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Awapuhi Ginger mask for the first time this past weekend and these are my first impressions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Color: light pink&lt;br /&gt;*Consistency: very thick but not stiff&lt;br /&gt;*Smell: did not like it, it smelled like hair relaxer HOWEVER once applied to my hair it became a really fragrant floral scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the mask as my pre-poo prior to co-washing: dampened my hair with water from a spritz bottle, separated it into 4 sections then generously applied the mask to each section.  Next I covered my hair with a conditioning cap &amp; towel and left it on for about 5 hours. Prior to rinsing the mask out, I lightly finger detangled my hair but the product didn&#x27;t have enough slip for me to follow-up by detangling with a comb.  I rinsed with warm water and I must say it took quite a bit of rinsing to get all of the product out but my hair felt very soft and smelled faintly fragrant after I was done. Even though I used it generously there is still enough in the jar for at least 4+ uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately applied a leave-in, oil &amp; moisturizer but would like to see how my hair will react if I skip the L-I &amp; oil and just let it air dry after rinsing. I also want to test its slip capabilities for comb/brush detangling &amp; test the claim that this is a good deep condish to use after color treating my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was really pleased with the mask and plan to purchase one or two jars per year as a stand-by in case I run out of my favorite pre-poo/DC products.</li>
    <li> This product made my color processed hair soft and shiny and the smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;I only had it on for 10 minutes (package suggests 20) but it still worked perfect.</li>
    <li> The best products!! amazing price and they do work! I have purchased lots of Organix products and they are all incredible! and the smell is just amazing as well!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mask that the Organix brand has. It really makes my hair silky soft. For reference, I&#x27;m caucasian with long thick wavy hair. I particularly use this before and after I color my hair and when I&#x27;m using hot tools often. I think it makes most of a difference when you use it every day or every other day. I just wish it was easier to find in drugstores.</li>
    <li> Great smell, made my 4b/4c hair soft, but I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the price! I&#x27;ve found other products, where you get the same job for a better deal!</li>
    <li> this product is a god sent.  totally helped to repair my over processed and completely fried hair.  I could see improvement in just the first use.  its been two weeks since I&#x27;ve been using it and my hair is already at least 50% better.  considering that my hair had be over bleached and was breaking all over. this is a miracle!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful that this product would revive my hair back to how it used to be. Unfortunately, it definitely was not instant... Even with me using more than what it called for &amp; sitting under a blow dryer for 30mins. It&#x27;s not that my hair felt extra dry or anything, but it was not as soft and moisturized as I had hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed on packaging but will probably look to other sellers next time around.  Otherwise was fine with product.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair for the first time with a permanent dye and the results were horrible! Not only did the color come out completely wrong, it left my hair extremely brittle and unhealthy looking. I freaked out, looked online and found out that cheap dandruff shampoo would help take some of the color out (it was way too light), but it would also take out the last bit of nutrients I had in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Walmart and bought the shampoo and saw this mask. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try out! I washed my hair 3 times with the shampoo and then used the mask for 20 minutes with a plastic bag on my head (didn&#x27;t have a shower cap:)). What a difference!!!!! This mask restored my shine and made my hair look healthy again! I could not be any happier with the results. My color faded, and I still use the mask 2-3 times a week instead of a conditioner. Now I get compliments on how healthy my hair looks all the time! LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic in a jar. It has a lot slip for my natural women and I just love it. I just used the last of mine and I&#x27;m pretty sad about it. The OGX line has amazing products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair product due to the reviews. Love the smell, hate the way it tangles my hair. I tried this twice two different ways but both times I left the product on my hair for longer than 20 minutes each time and still the same results. I have naturally curly hair and I also highlight my hair, I was looking for a great deep conditioning treatment as well as something that would help with detangling. I can&#x27;t say it helped with either of my problems.</li>
    <li> My hair is so dry and brittle from coloring/bleaching heat styling and I decided to give this a try.  My hair usually blow drys quickly well I used this and tried blow drying my hair it would not dry! It sersiously took FOREVER  It held in moisture and was super soft.  This is the first time I am using it and I like the results so far!</li>
    <li> My hair loves this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes my hair very easily manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this mask, I use it as a deep conditioner and a leave in. When I rinse it out, I don&#x27;t rinse it out completely and continue with my normal styling routine. The only problem I have is the small amount I get about 2 uses. Hair: natural 4a, 4b and 4c color treated.</li>
    <li> this deep conditioner has worked wonders on my overprocessed hair.  I had been using Moroccon Oil&#x27;s Intense Hydrating Mask with Argan Oil and it was just so-so.  I heard about the Organix Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask in a women&#x27;s magazine while on vacation, and immediately drove to a nearby drugstore to purchase it.  Am I glad I did!  When I use it as directed,under a shower cap for at least 20 minutes, my hair turns silky soft and doesn&#x27;t show the frizzies anymore.  It rinses out easily, leaving a mild, not unpleasant scent.  Try this!  It&#x27;s a bargain at twice the price, IMO.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product! I went from being dark-brown/burgundy to &amp;#34;Khaleesi-white&amp;#34;. Needless to say, my hair was pretty damaged. After using the product for a week, my hair is SOOOO soft and manageable. Definitely recommend for anyone with damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner! It smells so nice! could be a little heavier for my thick hair, but it is the one I prefer to use. I get the shampoo and regular conditioner at walgreens and then have to order this online. I will probably continue to do so until it isn&#x27;t around anymore.</li>
    <li> I feel fortunate to have found this product &amp; at a price I can afford. I had my hair bleached for the first time &amp; when I left the salon (not a top of the line place) my hair was so dry and felt like it was going to just break off. I was so sad because I already missed my healthy looking &amp; feeling hair. It was hard to even touch it. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately went to Target &amp; washed it (although they told me not to) and used the mask for no longer than my shower lasted, so about 10 minutes tops and I was amazed. My hair was soft again. The more I used it, probably 2-3x per week for the first month the better it got and now it&#x27;s fully recovered! I still use it about 1x per week though due to the heat damage it endures weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying it for anyone with just overall dry hair &amp; even someone who deals with a lot of frizz. This with the Organix Argan Oil once the hair is dry &amp; styled is a winning combination for me. :)</li>
    <li> My hair is long, and while each individual strand is fine, there is a LOT of it, so even in dry climates it&#x27;s prone to frizzing and flyaways.  Over the past several years, I&#x27;ve been looking for a high-quality conditioning mask that would leave my hair moisturized, manageable, and shiny without weighing it down.  I gave this a shot after reading a review about awapuhi ginger online.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s got awapuhi ginger and keratin, which the product-savvy will recognize as the combination Paul Mitchell uses in one of their treatments.  It smells unoffensive...I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite smell in the world, but it&#x27;s pretty enough and very mild.  When I first used it I was skeptical because my hair didn&#x27;t feel silky and glossy with it on, something I&#x27;ve grown to expect from a leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, it was right after I got home from a swim.  The chlorine had left my hair a snarled, brittle mess.  After the recommended time I rinsed it out and found that my hair felt smoother already.  When I went to brush it, it took considerably less effort than usual.  After blowing it dry, though, I became a true believer.  My hair was smooth, shiny, and soft, even without a flat-iron.  I have used everything from salon products to Sally&#x27;s Beauty to drugstore, and this was the best result I&#x27;ve had.  When I use this conditioner, I can rub my ends together without hearing that tell-tale crackle of dryness, even at the end of the day and with no additional product.  I was also impressed by its staying power; I wash my hair every other day, and on the morning of day three (before I&#x27;d gotten a chance to wash it) I bumped into someone who commented on how nice it looked.  That was approximately 48 hours after my last washing, and my hair didn&#x27;t look stringy or greasy or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once a week for the full 20 minutes and for 3-5 minutes after I swim or do anything else damaging.  I can&#x27;t shut up about how much I love this product!</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all. My hair is fairly straight &amp; fine, with highlights and it actually felt rougher, and snagly after.</li>
