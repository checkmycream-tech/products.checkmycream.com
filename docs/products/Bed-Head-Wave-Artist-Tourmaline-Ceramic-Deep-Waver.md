<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This could be me as much as it&#x27;s the machine, but honestly, I can&#x27;t get it to do a dang thing.  I&#x27;m lucky if it looks like I&#x27;ve crimped my hair by the time I&#x27;m done.  I could just have unreasonably HEAVY hair, and that makes it unwaveable?  IDK.  I&#x27;ve tried dirty, clean, with hairspray, without....even on my daughters hair, which is a bit finer than mine.  So, it&#x27;s either ME or the machine, either way, it&#x27;s in the back of my cabinet now.  boo.</li>
    <li> if you touch your skin with this, the burn is really bad</li>
    <li> They blew out after one use.</li>
    <li> As a former hairdresser, I found that this was not necessarily a bad product, but more like a large crimping iron that was so popular at one time. If you purchase this, as all heated hair accessories, be careful not to leave it on one spot too long or you may be in for more heat damage than you were aware of. Again, it&#x27;s not a bad product and I&#x27;m sure find that it&#x27;s what they were looking for. But as for me, I found that it was just a larger version of a crimping iron.</li>
    <li> I like this product but I can&#x27;t say that I love it....  It does what it says it will do buuuut I have very think hair and I don&#x27;t think that it gets hot enough to quickly wave the hair.  I have to hold the waver in place for much longer than the 3-5 seconds it says you need.</li>
    <li> I love the how easy it is to work and its so fast I can do my whole head in 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!!! It really works!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair is poker straight, very long, has no volume, and is fine. It never holds style even with product. This is my new best friend! Holds all day without fail and I get a lot of compliments. I even style it the night before, twist it up in a bun, take it out the next morning, and I am ready to go.</li>
    <li> wife states does not work the way it is advertized</li>
    <li> I am not certain if I were using the Bed Head Deep Waver correctly because it didn&#x27;t seem to work at all on my hair. I didn&#x27;t even get a bit of a wave from it. I ended up re-selling it in a yard sale.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter.  It works well to make waves on her hair.  It has a tight clamp so your hand can get tired holding it, but there is a lock you can click to keep it shut.  It gets extremely hot so you need to be attentive so that your hair does not burn.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like I have beach hair and I live in TN! HAHA, This curling iron or wave maker is awesome. It takes a few times to get the hang of it but I love.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, love the results, have received compliments everytime I have used it. The only thing I would change is make it easier to get the roots but overall I have gotten great results.</li>
    <li> Great product!! A must have</li>
    <li> What a waste of money!  And now I have to go through the hassle of return.  This promises a beach like wave, what a joke!  It creates the crimp stye from back in the 70-80&#x27;s. Plus is frizzes your hair!  I tried straightening my already straight hair and adding more product and then using this but still ICK.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed, but realize that the beach wave is something I cannot obtain. Straight hair it is, or I will just braid my hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted a waver that created deep waves.  I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with this brand in the past, so I was weary of purchasing this product.  However, because of the positive reviews, I decided to purchase this item anyways.  I&#x27;m so happy I got this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does create really big waves.  It heats up really fast and gets really hot.  It&#x27;ts perfect for my coarse, thick, asian hair.  I waited a really long time to purchase this item because I didn&#x27;t think I would ever use it.  I thought this waver would take way too long to use and I could braid my hair to get the same result.  Nope, not the case.  No matter now big you braid, you aren&#x27;t going to get waves like this.  This tool doesn&#x27;t take forever either because of how wide the waver is.  This tool did 5 inches of hair (length) at a time.  This really speeds up the amount of time spent using the tool.  Also, it can handle a lot of hair at one time.  I could easily do two to three inches of hair (thickness) at a time (I have a really coarse hair too)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that the bottom of the iron got really hot.  I had to set it down on a towel when I was adjusting my hair because I didn&#x27;t want to burn my carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a really good purchase!  I recommend!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to work or not but it works great. It makes big waves just like it says and you can do pretty big pieces of hair so it doesn&#x27;t take as long as a curling wand would.</li>
    <li> Easy to use! I love styling my hair with it. Now it does take time but its all worth it.</li>
    <li> This does such an awesome job!! Get so many compliments!!</li>
    <li> first i gotta say fast delivery i got it in 2 days. this is a great purchase my hair is very complicated is waevy,thick and nappy and this product work great on my hair and it makes it look so healthy i will recommend this product if you like hair with a lot volume and deep waves i give it a 10</li>
    <li> I am in love with product. It is my new best friend. I use it all of the time and the waves stay beautiful for days. I get compliments everyday. People always ask if it&#x27;s natural. I have had many friends purchase this.</li>
    <li> Love the waves I get from this! Great price as well! Very happy.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my 12 year old daughter. Its ok, doesnt give waves like I expected. Dont think I would recommend</li>
    <li> AM IN LOVE WITH THE BED HEAD DEEP WAVER  IT WORKS SO WELL WITH MY HAIR SPECIALLY THAT SUMMER IS ON THE DOORS!</li>
    <li> Best waver on the market! I have pin straight hair and this gives me really deep waves that could last for days!</li>
    <li> I love it. It works really good and leaves beautiful waves. Also it was here in 3 days so good shipping and fast delivery</li>
    <li> this waver is great, always get compliments when I use it, a lot less expensive than the premium brand!</li>
    <li> my daughter likes the wavy but has think hair and they don&#x27;t stay. We&#x27;ll keep trying for the effect we want but just a warning that it may not be the best for thick hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is so thick and I needed something a bit bigger to get the job done quicker. This heats up so quick and does wonders to my hair. I have had so many people compliment me on it and this product truly gives my hair the sexy, big (not too big) waves that I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Really made my hair look great! Love this and will continue to use</li>
    <li> my hair looks extremely messy, damaged. It doesn&#x27;t make any S waves, instead, weird patterns of hair. I returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> This works so great! I am so happy with my purchase!- It is a super fast and easy way to do your hair and it looks great!</li>
    <li> This thing gets super hot, but there is nowhere to press it tight when you&#x27;re using it. I mean, you can&#x27;t press the top and bottom tighter because it is so hot. I touched the tip when I first used it and burned my fingertips It does make pretty waves. Also, I have thick hair, so my hair looked really big after doing my whole head. I had to pin it back some. Also, (for me) the morning after the day that I use it I wake up with frizzy hair. But again, the waves it makes are pretty and it&#x27;s easy to use once you get the hang  of it.</li>
    <li> It was a decent waver for the price. I would personally like it if the waves were a little bigger, but not bad overall. I was pleased with the result! :)</li>
    <li> My sister loves it but I didnt.  It doesnt curl like the way it showed in the pictures.</li>
    <li> I love this deep waver. It&#x27;s night to try something different with your hair, and this was definately it! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> loved it . but not for short hair. Done good when I had long hair very pretty natural curl. Pretty good over all</li>
    <li> The product is probably fine for those wanting big waves. I&#x27;m looking for something between a deep waver and a crimper. Will give this product to my daughter who has long hair and likes bigger waves.</li>
    <li> I am a stylist and this is by far my favorite tool!! It creates beautiful waves!! The shipping was crazy fast got it in one day!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this waver! I will however say for better results you need at least shoulder length hair..there is a mini version of this waver of your hair is shorter...other than that if your on the fence go for it!! You&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I received this product, but I was pleasantly surprised! Easy to use, heats up quickly and it leaves great waves!</li>
    <li> Okay, I have only used this thing once (this morning) but I am in love and am so glad I bought it. I have long, fine straight hair. I washed it last night, let it air dry, then spray shampooed the roots this morning for any grease that may occur today (I have greasy hair). I pretty much just waved the ends of my hair starting from the ears down in chunks after lightly spraying my hair with a flexible hold hairspray. It only took about 10 minutes to do my entire head, and it looks awesome. I have gotten so many compliments on may hair, and it was so easy! I love this thing. I hope it lasts a while and doesn&#x27;t burn out after a few uses, but so far, I have to say this product is a 5 star rating!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has really long, thick hair. If you pick up the hair sections and use the iron, starting at the top,going down the hair shaft, it really does make large waves! I held the iron closed on each section, for a count of five. We put a little hair spray on it and it stayed for days! I wasn&#x27;t sure if the weight of her long hair would hold the waves, but they did! It&#x27;s worth the buy. It took about 40 minutes to do her entire head, so plan ahead...time wise!</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product, it does what it says it will do and the waves turn out exactly as they do in the picture. It heats up fast, is very easy to use and it&#x27;s all that you&#x27;d expect it to be. There are a couple draw backs but I didn&#x27;t mind really. First, the temperature isn&#x27;t shown-it only says hi or low and the lowest setting worked fine for my hair, I&#x27;m assuming that it gets pretty hot if you want it to. The other draw back is that it&#x27;s a bit clunky, and I burned myself 3 or 4 times when I first tried it out so definitely be careful. Another draw back is that it does not give any volume on the hair closest to your scalp, not sure how to word that but it annoys me. It&#x27;s like flat at the top and then wavy. It&#x27;s not much of an issue, I can go back in with my straightener and add some volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I think this is a very good deal and it&#x27;s a nice product, I really like the &amp;#34;mermaid&amp;#34; style hair and I think this deep waver gives that effect effortlessly.</li>
    <li> This bed head deep waver gives my hair a different look adding subtle waves throughout my hair. It&#x27;s a great part of my styling tools collection. It doesn&#x27;t create big voluminous waves; it creates more pretty subtle waves.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Bed Head Deep Waver from Amazon a few weeks ago and I am very pleased! I&#x27;ve become a pro at curling my hair with a flat iron but, I wanted something that would give me a more natural beach wave look. I find that the waves hold well all day and even after sleeping on them all night, look pretty good in the morning. (I use a flexible hairspray) Obviously, you can control where you want the wave to start (either close to your scalp or halfway down your hair). This particular waver was also one of the cheaper ones! Someone said in their review that it made their hair look crimped but I think they were just doing the waves too close together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Heats up fast....and it gets hot hot hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The outside of the waver gets hot too. I have a glove that came with another iron that I have to prevent finger burns!!</li>
    <li> so simple to use love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I&#x27;ve been wanting to wave my hair.. I have a triple barrel and every time I ask someone the difference between a triple barrel and a waver I could never get a real answer... Well I&#x27;m here to tell you that there is no real big difference...  They basically do the same thing and really this is a great thing...  When I waved my hair it was a day dirty which helps the wave to last longer..  And to be honest it&#x27;s looks better the second day after your hair is already waved with product in it..  My hair is medium long and looks good with the waver.. It doesn&#x27;t look to short..  I can say that wavers  do the best job on longer hair.. You will look like a mermaid... Needless to say I looked and felt like a tigress and was completely satisfied with my new waver.. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it&#x27;s very time consuming...</li>
    <li> 2yr old could of done better than this thing. Tried on others hair also and still came out nothing like it said.</li>
    <li> Love it.  A little learning curve but looks great and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described, it was a gift &amp; she loves it (23 year old daughter) very hard to find in Canadian stores so thanks again for making her Christmas list complete.</li>
    <li> I love this deep waver. its very easy to use. the instructions are clear, the lock function is perfect for storage, and it gets the job done fast. i have a short bob, a little past my chin. i love retro do&#x27;s from the 1920s/30s finger roll/wave, to the 50s, gentle S waves. on my first try, i achieved a lovely retro do, no practice needed. the barrel heats up fairly quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;some people like to purchase sprays or lotions to put in the hair before or after using a waver or curler, so that the hair locks into the look and lasts longer. i prefer not to use any thing of the sort, in order to keep soft waves, not crunchy. my waves have lasted without the use of any other products. all that needs to be done, say the next day, is to go over the same spots with the waver, to reinforce and redefine the waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve never had a deep waver before, and i&#x27;m sure there are other great ones out there, that perhaps create slightly different looks, but this one is definitely a good buy, at a good price.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly, I have long thick hair and it did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;The waves really last and it&#x27;s ideal if you want to do you hair the night before and then just touch it up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> To be honest I was kind of disappointed in this product. It arrived early in new  in its box but eh. I&#x27;ve used better wavers but the price is good so I&#x27;ll keep using and maybe my first impression was wrong.</li>
    <li> Good product. Will buy again if needed.  This thing is legit.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 cause the first one fell off my counter and the lil lock piece broke off so it wouldn&#x27;t stay shut it still works I just think it heats more when the irons closed in between pieces of hair. But I do keep the other as a back up!! Can you say hoarder lol J/k</li>
    <li> This crimper is amazing, it gets hot fast and stays hot and leaves waves that look like relaxed curls in my hair. The back draw is that i have very thick hair so it takes about 1 hour and 20 min to do my whole head. Other then that it is great. If you you are thinking about buying this as a gift i would go ahead and do it. Like i said before it heats up amazingly and its very light weight. Even arrived the day it was suppose to, which is always great.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it makes larger waves than the regular triple barrel waver. I love it! My only complaint is that for the price, I do wsh the waves were just a littke harsher. These go softer after an hour and don&#x27;t sit the sane. Overall it&#x27;s a fabulous tool with a fabulous result -- big hair with lasting waves :) highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I really love this tool. Its so easy to get my hair styled fast. (I got mine from target only because I had a gift card but its the same one here and I love amazon)&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR TYPE:  I have long, med thick, fine straight hair. I Love taking my bath at night and just letting my hair air dry, then in the AM I spend about 15 min with this tool and my hair looks totally cute. (Way less time than wash and blow dry! I rather snooze...) The result looks like the pics the other ladies have posted (very pretty.) It is a &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; look, not crimpy or frizzy. At least not on my hair. I can not speak for other hair type because I have zero body naturally.&lt;br /&gt; QUALITY: This is a relatively cheep tool. I left off one star because more expensive models look a little better made comparatively. Don&#x27;t pay more than $25 bucks. There is no temp setting on the dial its just Hi-lo. I don&#x27;t waste time so I always use high on all my tools but the point is you don&#x27;t know what &amp;#34;HI&amp;#34; really is. It says ceramic but i own much better ceramic tools so its not impressive. There is a lock that keeps the tool closed but I do not use that when I&#x27;m styling I just hold the clamp. Its nice for storing. It works well so I did not feel like spending more on the competitors.&lt;br /&gt;STYLING: I don&#x27;t think this tool is any more damaging to my hair than a typical iron.  My hair is annoyingly healthy and slippery (sorry, but despite what you may think slippery hair is not that great) so I grab wide chunks (about 4 inches) there is nothing to wrap you just press so it goes way faster than curling. I DO NOT leave the iron on for more than 5-8 seconds before I move it (hi setting) and I let the hair untouched until my whole head is done and its cool. Then I go through it with my fingers and shake a little to separate the waves. Maybe some hair spray lightly but its a lot of body so I don&#x27;t need a lot else.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I love this contraption and I get compliments all the time. I would consider investing more money on the same tool with better quality but I&#x27;m on a budget so this works great for me right now. I absolutely recommend for convienice and the look is so cute.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled when I wanted to curl my hair because it&#x27;s annoyingly thick - until now. This product was sent from heaven! Not only does it create big wavy curls just how I want them, but they also hold for the whole day. Definitely recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, my daughter loves it when I wave her hair with this. It&#x27;s still working after 1.5 years of use.</li>
    <li> Its so worth the money, I use this thing every week and its amazing. I love the way it makes my hair look. Look up some yotube tutorials on how to use it properly to make awesome waves and you&#x27;re set.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair waver. Keeps waves nice and together once you get the hang of how to use it. Makes really nice waves. They are only one size though, you can&#x27;t adjust the length of the wave</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does exactly what you anticipate it will, create even waves. Have to be a little careful though as it pulls hair in so if you&#x27;re close to your scalp, when you clamp it moves a little closer and... ow.</li>
    <li> It honestly didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair but make it frizzy.</li>
    <li> I have combination hair, meaning it&#x27;s really wavy in the back (basically looks like it just came out of a braid) and less so in the front. I bought this to try and get my hair evenly wavy all around. This product does not disappoint. The waves are more subtle rather than crimped- think 20s finger curls rather than tight, defined \\&quot;s\\&quot; curls- but it was exactly what I was looking for. Heats quickly, the barrels are solid and it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap even though it&#x27;s a less expensive waver. I say go for it.</li>
    <li> Love this, and the best price to be found!</li>
    <li> I love this waver. I had a Revlon one, but it broke, so I had to get another one. I was searching online and I came across this one, at a great price and cool color, I had to get it. The heat setting is high, which is great, b/c it keeps the waves in my hair for days. It can snag some hair if you put it too far inside the edge of the waver, but other than that, I have nothing bad to say about it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a new triple barrel waver iron to replace her Revlon iron that was lost in the move. We had gone to different shops and she looked online. You name it, she searched it. There was a waver iron she found in the mall but it was $50! She refused to pay that much for it. I suggested she look on Amazon and low and behold, she found this Bed Head triple barrel waver iron. She fell in love, especially because the handle is her favorite color (she calls it electric blue). She had to have it. $30 isn&#x27;t steep at all, let alone the fact that she got within 4 days from placing the order. Needless to say, she is happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the great reviews. But unfortunately I doubt that there are any good cheap hair tools:(&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very difficult to use, it burns hair even with a protective spray and the plastic starts to melt quiet fast.&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s a garbage.</li>
    <li> WOW!  Took me about 10 minutes to do my entire head of hair!  I have very long thick hair!  it&#x27;s straight.  After about 10 minutes, my hair had great waves.  I got sooooooooooooo many compliments!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. Makes large natural looking waves.</li>
    <li> creates very nice beachy waves, love it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair and I bought this to touch up the places that don&#x27;t look right when I wake up. This is a great improvement on using a curling iron, which makes spirals and not true waves. I have hair slightly below my shoulders, and I only have to use this product twice on each chunk of hair--once at the top and once at the bottom. This makes it go quickly. Also, I have thick hair, and I only need to \\&quot;wave\\&quot; the outside to get a full effect. On high heat, the product works quickly and makes lasting waves. Low heat does almost nothing to my hair. It is just a tad awkward to hold, but it is worth it. It has a lock switch that will help clamp the product closed on your hair. Probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that for too long on high heat.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new favorite beauty tool!  My hair doesn&#x27;t like to cooperate if I try to curl it or straighten it, and so I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical about purchasing this bad boy.  However, I used this tool the day after I received it and am in love!  It is incredibly easy to use and looks REALLY GOOD.  As suggested by other readers. I lightly sprayed my hair with hairspray and brushed it through before using this product.  If you have lots of hair, I&#x27;d definitely invest in some clips so that you can keep your hair clipped away while you&#x27;re waving your hair.  You&#x27;re going to love this.  I will say that it&#x27;s a bit hard to do the back of your hair, but practice makes perfect.  Either way, this tool is a time saver and definitely looks way better than an adolescent crimper.</li>
    <li> The waves lasted all day with a light mist of hair spray at the end.  Best price here, a fraction of what they charge at beauty stores.</li>
    <li> I love this waver. I never knew about them until my friend had one and did my hair I had finally found something that would give me the waves I dreamed of. I love the look of this waver and the waves look great. It does take some practice to get the perfect waves but after the 2nd try I had it down pack. The waves lasted 2 day without me having to go retouch it. The item shipped fast and I have really had no issues with it. If there is 1 thing I could change it would be that they put a plastic part to the top and bottom so those parts don&#x27;t get hot. The whole silver part you see gets hot and I have burnt myself twice because of that. But its no big deal, other than that I have no problems. I most definitely would recommend this product and the price is perfect!</li>
    <li> For some weird reason it&#x27;s not doing anything on my hair, or it will start to but then stop.</li>
    <li> This product did a great job....while it worked. I probably used it ten times and it stopped heating. The light still came on while plugged in...but the iron stayed cold. Checked on amazon about returning it and a month had passed so it was not eligible to send back.</li>
    <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the waves to stick. I have shoulder length hair that is layered so I&#x27;m sure that plays a role in how well this works. I let my sister-in-law test it out since she has longer hair and again it didn&#x27;t work too well. She ended up having to spray each individual piece of hair with hairspray and then hold the waver shut until it got really really hot, which unfortunately isn&#x27;t very good for your hair, but I must admit when she finished, her hair looked quite nice.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Makes large beachy waves and they last all day.</li>
    <li> Very high quality product. Shipped and got the product within three days after ordering. However, it heats up VERY hot. I burnt myself while using it. Make sure to use a heat protectant spray because it can dry out your hair. Over all, my hair looked great after using this product, very loose curls thats lasted all day (would&#x27;nt recommend if you wanted super curly or ringlet hair).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters hair.  It worked great.  Can&#x27;t really beat the price either.</li>
    <li> LOVE this waver. Cheap and works like $100 waver! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Curls don&#x27;t last long. Had higher hopes for this item.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this waver!!  I did a very brief wave to check it out and it was fantastic.  I love the look it gave to my normally flat boring hair!  It was easy to use!  The only down side is that it gets so stinking hot everywhere, and I found myself paying attention to the hair and not the shoulder and got a little burn!  Nothing major, just need to remember to wear a turtleneck next time LOL.  Overall I would recommend it to friends, family, enemies, etc.  Well, sadly, I have had my Deep Waver for almost 3 months, and it has stopped working.  The light comes on that shows that it is plugged in, but it no longer gets hot.  I am very very disappointed.  I have contacted the company and I hope that I can get a different one (that last longer than 3 darn months!!)</li>
    <li> should really be called a crimper. this does not wave at all. if you are going to an 80s (90s?) party this is a great product to do your hair.</li>
    <li> This item shipped perfectly and it such an amazing tool  I get that &#x27;just from the beach&#x27; look.    Love Bed Head!</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to all of my styling tools! I really do think this is a great Iron and it does exactly as I thought it would. It makes my hair voluminous and gives me the wave I was looking for! I love this iron and would recommend anyone who wants to add volume to thin hair! This iron is a must!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought me this for Christmas and I absolutely adore it! The waves are so beautiful and effortless. I will definitely be using this pretty often!</li>
    <li> This deep waver gets the job done</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas from my parents and absolutely LOVE it! I&#x27;ve used it  twice now!&lt;br /&gt;And it looks great as second day hair too because the waves are more relaxed!&lt;br /&gt;I have super fine, thin hair so this hot tool also gives my hair HREAT volume without the use of nearly any hair products (except for a few spritz of hairspray). Definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> This thing makes your hair very wavy. Like ocean waves literally, you will need medium length hair or it won&#x27;t look right. A little difficult to use at first but once you get a flow going it is worth it. Takes about 1 hour or more to do shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> This has turned my daughter into an addict.  She loves her hair waved and this is so easy to use.  I was hesitant at first because her hair doesn&#x27;t want to curl.  I have never had a problem with this.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter after her old one broke.  She loves it.  It waves much better than a roller barrel one.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite hair styling tool.  I have been eyeing this for awhile but I was afraid that it would give my hair more of a crimped look.  Now I&#x27;m really glad I decided to try it.  I usually curl my hair with a wand or my chi straightener, but with this I get much more natural looking waves.  It also takes much less time than I thought it would.  I have long thick hair, and it takes me less than 5 minutes to do all of my hair.  I also tried it on my sister, who has short thin hair, and she loved it as well.</li>
    <li> Love this tool! So easy to use too</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my trip to Europe  and it was AMAZING  I would definitely  recommend</li>
    <li> This product was great the first few weeks that I owned it.  However, it suddenly stopped working after about 5 uses.  The waver will not turn on or heat up.  Helen of Troy has offered to replace it, but I must mail the defective one back at my own expense.  What a hassle this has been.</li>
    <li> My hair is a little long but has lots of short layers so kinda makes it puffy but tweaked it to where it looks good. Definitely use moose when hair is wet and then dry it. Before each strand spray it with flexible hairspray and it looks so much better. My girls have hair that has no layers and it is perfect on them! Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Great product great service</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using my friends deep wavers for ever and finally thought I needed one for myself, so I ordered this one and it came within a few days! I was kind of worried when I received it though, because in the picture it looks like the tool will make really deep indents in my hair, but it didn&#x27;t come out like that at all. The waves came out perfect and everyone would ask if my hair was naturally curly. I don&#x27;t really like doing big pieces at a time when using this, but if I do, I just split the piece wants it done to make it look more curly as if I did smaller pieces.</li>
    <li> I have naturally frizzy/wavy hair so I straightened it first and then used the waver and it was so gorgeous! I received so many compliments! I held it closed on my hair for 5 or 6 seconds and ended up going 3 times down each section. The waves even looked good after sleeping on my hair, I just kind of ran a pick through it to comb out the tangles. Definitely an awesome purchase and way cheaper than my hair straightener was! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Love this! My hair is super thick and it works perfect! Love that beach wave it gives me! So easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have really difficult hair. It is very thick and there is a lot of it. Every time I have ever used a curling iron on my hair, the curls have fallen out before I can even finish. The only way I could achieve wavy hair before this was to braid my hair at night when it&#x27;s wet, sleep and take it down in the morning, and even then it wasn&#x27;t the big even waves I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;That was before this deep waver. This was on my wish list on Amazon and my boyfriend bought it for me for Christmas last year. I am so happy with it. Worth every penny. I get voluminous beautiful waves that not only last all day, but are even still there the next day after I wake up. And the best part? It takes 5 minutes to use! With my hair as thick as it is, styling is typically a 30 minute routine, but with this, it takes no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;I use this so much, people think I have naturally wavy hair. It really is the hair product I&#x27;ve always wanted but could never find. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I hope everyone else loves it as much as I do. :]</li>
    <li> I love this iron soo much! Its perfect for creating waves and just creating curls I always get compliments on this look its awesome !</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have since complemented me on my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; waves. This tool makes GORGEOUS, natural-looking waves (nothing like those 80&#x27;s-looking kinks). The waves stand the test of time too, especially surprising with my thick and hard-to-curl hair.</li>
    <li> Hard to get it out of the clamp. Bulky and difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Ugh. I had high hopes for this but it made my hair look like a frizz ball. In all fairness I might just need some practice. I have a co-worker that does a pretty good job on her hair with this same styler. It is really bulky though, awkward to maneuver and the worst part is not actually knowing what temperature the iron is at (I would like to know temperature in degrees like 375, 425, etc not &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;) so I don&#x27;t burn my hair off.</li>
    <li> This deep waver is basically recommended by me, however it makes my hand hurt after a while.  It seems that they put some sort of thumb or finger gripper on the handle, but it is all made out of toothy plastic, so it ends up ripping up my hand after a while.  You do have to put some pressure on when holding it, and it does take about 15-20 minutes to do a decent job on the hair, especially if it is thick like mine.  I wish they would have put a comfy foam handle on it and it would have 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars coz it gets so hot pretty easily and can damage your hair if you aren&#x27;t careful. But I like the waves that it creates, its a refreshing change from my usual loose curls look. Love love love it.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> My mother in law used this when she was visiting and loved it so much that I let her take it home with her.  On her hair the waves last 2-3 days.  On my fine hair the waves only last until I go to sleep, then they&#x27;re gone by the next morning.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003FBI9LS Bed Head Deep Waver]]AWESOME! Bought this item for my daughter but I ended up using it also. Tired of straight hair - do something fun. This item creates a wavy messy look. Really, really cute &amp; fun! Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is misleading, it will not give you \\&quot;beach waves\\&quot; but tight crimps, looks like 90&#x27;s hair but still cute!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome hair tool!!!! I get compliments on my hair EVERYTIME I use it! It&#x27;s perfect!!! You have to figure out where the waves should go next to make sure you don&#x27;t get a crease which is EASY to do! Highly recommend this iron!</li>
    <li> dont like it...the material is so cheap...and burn ypur hair...</li>
    <li> Love this product, use it all this time.  Works great, makes nice huge waves.  Heats up quick and does a great job</li>
    <li> I just received it today...tried it out right away. I love it, much easier to use than a curling Iron. I give Bed Head Waver 5 Stars. Thanks for this great product.</li>
    <li> It does everything I wanted it to do. Is easy to work with and fast. it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this waver! It makes my hairlook fantastic and who can argue with the price?</li>
    <li> I love this. Super easy to use. Watched a YouTube video on different ways to use it. It does get very hot and I burned myself a few times, so don&#x27;t crimp too close to scalp.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love how it does my hair. I have extremely thick hair so it takes some time to do it all but it looks great! Awesome product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have thick naturally pretty straight but sometimes a little wavy-ish hair.  The first time I used this, I was kind of disappointed because it made my hair sooooo frizzy and poofy, but I used a different technique the next time and it looked a lot better.  ALso, the heat setting may have something to do with it.  Instead of doing it in sections, I found it looks better if you just have all your hair down and then work from the outside in.  I know it&#x27;s usually supposed to be the opposite, but for some reason it just looks better and is quicker.  I also like to use herbal essences tousle me softly spray gel on it when I&#x27;m done.  It holds it without being hard.  The waves lasted super long. I can go two days without washing my hair and it will still look good.  I highly recommend this product to people who get frustrated with curling irons but still want a wavy look.</li>
    <li> very useful and practical, easy to use</li>
    <li> I have really fine straight hair. I do have a small amount of natural wave so to get a finished look I&#x27;ve always had to use a straightener which takes most of the body out of my hair. My hair also doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, it ends up falling and looking frizzy before the end of the night. I found this product and I was super excited to try it after reading some of the reviews. After a few weeks of using this waver I really found that I like its effects.   I have tried a triple barrel waver in the past, but the effects looked like I crimped my hair since it did loose some of its perkiness after a while. With this product I can create large waves that don&#x27;t disappear. The waves last all night and into the next day; which I was so surprised about. I have even slept in the waves and they still look presentable in the morning. This product allows me to create body without using a large amount of product (leaving my hair crunchy) or creating frizz. I also like that it takes much less time and effort then curling, which I struggle with doing myself. I do wish it still was a quicker process. It takes me about forty-five minutes, but each time I have used it I become better at sectioning the hair to take less time.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl, wave or anything of the like even with hairspray. With this waver, all I need is a flexible hold spray and they stayed all day. I didn&#x27;t even need to use any setting above low. The only con is that it&#x27;s kind of bulky.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite hair tool purchases!  By using more or less hair you can adjust how wavy your hair ends up.  My hair is fairly thick, layered, and a bit past my shoulders and it works great.  First day it&#x27;s way wild, but 2nd day it looks wonderful.  So much fun to add some waves to my stick straight hair and have it stay wavy for a couple days.</li>
    <li> Come on time,and the machine too good&lt;br /&gt; thank you very much,</li>
    <li> I love this hair styling tool, I&#x27;ve never been one to fuss too much with my hair because I have so much of it. This tool is easy to use and gives you nice waves. Heats up super fast. Good for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> I wanted a quality crimping iron, but some quality irons costed more than $100! I came to amazon and found this crimper. I ordered it, thinking it was a good price, and I got here on time. I tried it out and it worked perfect. It heated up in about 20-30 seconds and it only took 15 seconds to get a section of hair wavy. I have thick hair and it still worked perfectly! Don&#x27;t worry if it stems. It doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s burning your hair. I haven&#x27;t tried it out when I&#x27;m rushing in the mornings, but I&#x27;m sure it still would work in a rush. It only took me 1 minute to do a thick sliver of hair. It looks beautiful! I&#x27;m going to use it for all my special occasions. It gets pretty hot so make sure you are careful when it&#x27;s on. All in all, this is a great crimping iron and it&#x27;s expecially a great price for the value!</li>
    <li> This waver is great! Works great for my hair type....I have long think curly hair that I like to straighten and then make waves in. Great product.</li>
    <li> This waver is a definite must. It&#x27;s perfect if you&#x27;re going for that beachy look. I used to just straighten my hair constantly and I was getting bored with it so I tried this and loved it. First I straighten my hair then I go through it with the waver. I read one review that says it takes an hour but it definitely doesn&#x27;t if you straighten your hair first. The heat settings go wicked high, so it really takes no time at all and the look lasts all day!!</li>
    <li> I do like this Waver, only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is sometimes it can make you hair look a little frizzy. It may just be my hair? I have frosted blonde hair, which tends to frizz anyway, so it may work better for people with natural hair, no color...I would recommend this product, because it is a good quality waver, not cheap looking or feeling. It does get very hot on high, so you just have to be careful, as I have burnt my forehead twice already. Just need to use with caution, esp. for younger kids or teens using it, or in a hurry. All in all, I would probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> I looooooove my bed head deep waver. I can finally get the big waves that I couldn&#x27;t get with other crimp irons.</li>
    <li> easier to use than i thought it would be. adjusts to your needs</li>
    <li> I bought the Deep Waver hoping for an easy-to-use tool for creating natural looking, beachy waves. I am not very good in general with hairstyling tools, but the Deep Waver was simple to use, heated quickly, and produced beautiful, beach waves that lasted for two days. Very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This waver does exactly what it says and is fairly easy to use, minus a few burns that will inevitably happen each time you use it. I will admit when I got it I was a bit obsessed and used it everyday for several weeks. It works best with longer hair though, which I found out when I cut 8 inches off my hair, forcing it into an early retirement.</li>
    <li> This thing is worthless. Made me have frizzy 80s hair! Not good.</li>
    <li> can only do waves going down not going back away from your face. Company was quick with the response</li>
    <li> Received it this morning and it works wonders! I have a slight short bob and I kept trying to get a wavy look like this with, I kid you not, 3 different sized curling irons and it just looked like a train wreck. But this thing is great! It gives me a little waviness and it doesn&#x27;t look I spent a lot of time on it, when in reality I spent a total of 30 minutes. Not bad. Word or warning, if your hair is short like mine, be careful not to accidentally burn your ears, I learned that the hard way :)</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and heats up fast. Hair turns out great. Just like you see on the pictures on that package. Cord is also longer than your average hair straitener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my on this for a long time before finally trying it out and I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long.  I love it.  I have really long hair that is stick straight and very heavy.  Curling irons are way too much time and effort and because of the length and weight only the ends get a curl and I have yet to master the wand.  This creates very pretty waves and is so quick and easy to use.  I do a light mist of hair spray before or after using and the waves last a long time.  Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> hey i purchased this waver 6 months bk n hv been using it since then.i love the waves and the result.but the only minus point of it is \\&quot;its bulky \\&quot;.i would not recommend this for people who travel alot.because its difficult to carry this huge item.i would recommend a waver which is more sleek and easy to pack .</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely fantastic product. Does exactly what it says it does, and the &#x27;waves&#x27; stay for days. I use it on my naturally curly hair (crazy hair!), and what I do it straighten my hair the day before, then wave and hairspray my hair, and the waves will stay until I wash my hair. Absolutely fantastic product, and I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this waver for about 6 months now and am still very happy with it. It is very well made with a professional weight and balance to it and has an extra long cord. It is the same length as most curling irons but has a larger width barrel, which it needs to give soft, beachy waves rather than the tighter, crimped look of other wavers. I can get a nice look in about the same time as a regular curling iron but when I spend a little extra time (about 20 minutes total) on my thick, waist length hair, it looks amazing and is actually a time saver since my hair will hold its style for almost a week before needing to do anything other than freshen up my bangs. I recently took this on a cruise and it saved me tons of time over the course of the week. All the women in my family used this, from teenagers to 40+ and we all were able to get a look that was fun and still age appropriate. I had never used a waver before but am glad I took the plunge with this one.</li>
    <li> Great iron works as they say.makes my hair look beachy.</li>
    <li> I love this! Twisting each section before you wave it will keep you from getting that weird forced wave and gives you perfect beach waves!</li>
    <li> Works as expected after playing around with it for a few weeks.  This is my first waver and it does a great job :)</li>
    <li> I just got my waver in the mail. Plugged it in for a quick test and I LOVE IT!! it works perfect for what I want and it&#x27;s everything I expected it to be. So reasonably priced too! Totally worth it!!</li>
    <li> Never got to use it.. light turns on but no heat. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great price for this I don&#x27;t use it daily but it works very fast and great price for the quality!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, very pretty blue color. I get compliments on my hair allll the time. You can easily adjust the heat temperature which is great</li>
    <li> I thought this product would make my waves look really nice but it made them big and frizzy. it almost looked crimped. The other reviews are accurate in saying this product is bulky and difficult to use. It actually made my hand hurt when using it. It also needs something to sit on and I ended up using an oven mitt. I really wouldnt recommend this product and especially not for young users. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this waver because I wanted the &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; look. It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have normal, healthy hair. I started off with blow-drying my hair &amp; then used the waver. It made HUGE waves in my hair, and it just looked like i don&#x27;t know how to style it. I wasn&#x27;t happy with it, so I emailed amazon &amp; they refunded my money.</li>
    <li> The item is good and useful. Thank u.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the results of this product. I thought it would be a little more natural looking but I still love it</li>
    <li> THE BEST HAIR DEEP WAVER TOOL!!! give your hair a neat classy look or a messy tousled sexy look. i love that you dont have to be so neat and precise with it. it is my new favorite way to wear my hair. i have little to no patience for doing my hair and even i love this thing. i do not regret buying this one bit. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> This looks very natural and holds all day even afteri got rained on my waves were still there.</li>
    <li> Great product for a fun spunky style! Love this iron and for a very reasonable price! It&#x27;s a great iron!</li>
    <li> I bought this waver as a replacement for the Hot Tools Deep Waver, which broke on me after just a few uses.  I&#x27;ve had this one now for a couple of months and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  I just love the look of my hair after using it.  Get lots of compliments too.  My only complaint in the design of this product is where they placed the heat setting dial.  It&#x27;s right in the way of your thumb when using it, and it will re-adjust the heat setting without your knowledge, and it always seems to navigate to the hottest setting.  I ended of placing a drop of metallic nail polish on the dial so I could keep track of where the dial was set to, and the ultimate setting for my hair.  I find myself frequently adjusting it back during my styling time, otherwise I&#x27;d be scortching my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do love this product!!  I have been using it a while now (several times per week), and I have noticed a very strange phenomenom on my hair though.  I used to have hair that had lots of natural loose waves, and now that I&#x27;ve used this device, my hair is completely stick straight after I use it. (I want to clarify that the waver results are still fantastic - but without the use of this waver the natural state of my hair is now straight.)  It used to have body, now it looks as if I used a straight iron on it.  My hair has never been straight like this in my life.  It&#x27;s now straight as an arrow and it stays that way (even on humid days) unless I use this waver or another curling device on it.  Very strange.  I&#x27;m sure if I quit using this device and let my hair continue growing, the waves would come back.  But they literally disappeared after just a few uses of this waver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any other frequent users out there experience this same thing?</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t liek the results.  the waves don&#x27;t last for more than half hour.</li>
    <li> I use nearly the hotest setting on this waver because I have very thick hair and I like to just hold each section in the waver for just a few seconds.  I have used it maybe 5 times since I bought it a month ago.  When I tried to use it this last time, I noticed once I clamped it shut that it won&#x27;t open once I release my hand.  It stays clamped shut.  I have to wiggle it and pull it apart (with my hair clamped inside it) to get it to separate.  Upon inspection, the metal is warped near the bottom, closer to the blue handle.  I am not sure how this happened, maybe because I have it on the highest setting when I use it, but the metal warped and now it doesn&#x27;t open and close without manipulation, making it useless as a quick morning hair tool.  I am incredibly disappointed and of course am 2 days outside of the return allowance.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well i had expected</li>
    <li> My 9 year old granddaughter came over one day and had used  a waver that one of her friends had at a sleepover. We looked at several on Amazon and originally picked a different one to put on my wish list. She has very straight hair and the one we originally picked made lots of small waves. When we saw the pictures of this one and the big waves that it makes she liked it better. After opening it on Christmas Day she used it immediately and I must say it did what it was supposed to do. I only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know anything about these, this one did what the description said it would do and Maddi Girl really likes it.</li>
    <li> Seriously obsessed with waving my hair now. I have used regular 3 prong wavers in the passed and I really didn&#x27;t care for the look it gave me, so I tried this instead and i fell in love with it. The middle part is really deep so it gives a nice full wave to your hair. It doesn&#x27;t take very long to do and its easy to use. Great for the price! I strongly recommenced this to anyone :)</li>
    <li> This is great for a younger girl, but as an adult the curls it makes made me look ridiculous. My hair was a total mess, very frizzy</li>
    <li> I had never heard of a deep waver before, this thing ROCKS. I have long hair, about 4&amp;#34; past my shoulders and lots of layers, this thing takes less then 10min to do perfectly and like 5 min with no time and still my hair looks great! It covers a lot of hair at once and you only need to hold it on for 4+ seconds. I don&#x27;t know how I did without this thing. I did buy the &amp;#34;matching&amp;#34; hairspray and love that, but at $11 a bottle I will stick with a 3$ tresseme bottle from Target.</li>
    <li> hard to use, to get the look</li>
    <li> This works great. I have short and very thick hair and this puts the perfect wave in it. You just need to do small sections at a time. It&#x27;s a bit bulky to use at first but I&#x27;m used to it now.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I always had trouble getting the wavy look in my hair but this device works great. It heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t take long to use. It makes my thin looking hair look like I have much more volume!</li>
    <li> &#x27;Amazing&#x27; hair tool, I am totally happy with it &amp; it does super natural waves :)</li>
    <li> This tool is a must have. I have thick, curly, coarse, frizzy hair which can be an absolute pain to style. I find the deep waver to be quick, easy and styles it creates are beautiful :) VERY satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure what kind of look this was going to give me, but I absolutely love it.  My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t stop telling me how sexy I looked.  It doesn&#x27;t take real long to get the hang of.  I prefer the flat part to be facing upward it makes the look flow a little better.  I have thick hair that is a little past my shoulders. You have to use it horizontally not vertical.</li>
    <li> So easy to use. Outcome of hairstyle is great</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very thick straight hair. It will definitely give your hair a very pretty wave to it. Do not buy it if you are looking for the more curly &#x27;crimped&#x27; look. There are two reasons I am not giving it 5 stars: It gets very hot and even the end part will get uncomfortably hot to touch; and it isn&#x27;t exactly easy to use if you are trying to do it yourself. I have done my daughter&#x27;s hair several times and it is very cute, however she struggles to do it correctly herself especially in the back (she is 22 years old, so it isn&#x27;t an age issue). It just isn&#x27;t super easy to manage to curl the back. But otherwise it is exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> This is a great product it works very well and the curls really last long.I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I watched several \\&quot;how to\\&quot; videos on You Tube and that helped a lot in using this waver.  The first time I used it, the look was \\&quot;okay\\&quot;, but I think it has more to do with my lack of technique, versus the quality of the product.  The waves did last 2 days, with just minor touch-ups.  Hopefully with practice, I will get the waves I&#x27;m looking for.  The iron does get pretty hot, so it doesn&#x27;t take long to make a \\&quot;wave\\&quot;, even in thick hair like mine.  I would recommend this waver to anyone wanting the loose, casual look.</li>
    <li> Works quick on my fine thin hair but the outcome is frizz...not waves.  I have it on the lowest setting and use spray on conditioner and it still frizzes.</li>
    <li> I have wanted mermaid waves for years and this waver is AMAZING!  I use it often and the waves hold for 2-3 days!  So glad  I found this, and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Good waver but not great for a 10 year old. It is a little unwieldy for someone her age to use.</li>
    <li> My roommate and I have been using this waver for over a year now and we both love it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and heats up very quickly.  It can get too hot for your hair so be careful with it.  Other than that, this waver has been amazing and produces nice big waves that last all day!</li>
    <li> Did not work well on my straight hair, at all.  Just made it look very puffy; not wavy like I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast.  works well.  Down side; no marks on the heat dial so I estimated it took 3 finger turns to get from the low to high end so I use ONE turn and so far so good. *Caution; does get VERY hot if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> Really big only get for very long hair.</li>
    <li> This deep waver is great.  My hair is very thick, naturally straight, and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for very long.  What I like about this deep waver is that by the time I finish crimping my hair most of my waves have fallen a bit and look like natural beach waves.  I then run my hands through my hair, I don&#x27;t brush it and I get very nice beach waves.  I&#x27;d imagine if you have thin hair that holds a curl very well then your curls will turn looking like Z&#x27;s. But, for someone like me, this product is perfect.  Also, I don&#x27;t use any hair spray or hair products.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments when I use this gadget:)</li>
    <li> Time consuming but worth it</li>
    <li> it did its job but that was about it. i was expecting the waves to come out really nicely and &amp;#34;beachish&amp;#34; but it came out more crimped and stiff looking. also, it was a bit inconvenient using the deep waver because when you put your hair in between the metal plates and clamp down, the hair shortens as it fits into the curves, making it difficult to hold the hair as i clamped down without burning myself (if im making myself clear) overall, meh. i dont plan on using it again except for that only time when i tried it out, so its kind of a waste of money for me..</li>
    <li> Love this! I use a sea salt spray before I use the bedhead deep waver and then hair spray afterwards which helps it last all day especially because I&#x27;ve got stubborn flat fine hair that&#x27;s worse with humidity.</li>
    <li> I wanted beach waves, and after many failed attempts at non-heat methods to achieve that look, I searched around and found this. When I first used it, I was disappointed. My hair looked obviously ironed and was obnoxiously curly. I tried it again the next day, starting further away from my scalp and having bigger spaces in-between each clamped wave. Once I figured out how to use this, I absolutely love it. I have gotten many, many compliments on my hair, and I feel so much more attractive having hair that is textured and voluminous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;I spritz my washed and dried hair with gel and wait a few minutes for the gel to sit. Then I clamp and iron hair sections, holding for ten seconds at a time. When all is waved (takes about 15 minutes), I spritz my hair again, and then fluff up and tousle my hair afterwards to loosen the waves to look natural. I lightly backcomb my hair for even more volume. For me, the curls last two full days before I need to wash my hair and redo my waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has very thin hair, and I used this on her, doing the same routine I do for my own hair. The waves added so much volume to her hair, and now she is ordering her own waver!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product through youtube when i was reviewing how to style hair extensions... this works amazing... especially if you have long hair... i am forced to use aquanet because its the only hairspray that keeps my hair in place.. this waver kept my hair wavy for 2 days straight... im in love... its hard to find in stores so i was forced to buy it on here (which i always do because i am a prime member) it is cheaper on here as well, fast shipment.. very happy</li>
    <li> Well it gave me nice waves, but I&#x27;ve only used it once since buying it a year ago. It just feels so bad for your hair...you&#x27;re better off buying a curling wand</li>
    <li> Worked as expected no problems</li>
    <li> For the price it works so well!!</li>
    <li> best hair product I have ever purchased! creates awesome body and waves</li>
    <li> This iron exceeded my expectations when I received it.  I have long hair past my shoulders which is extremely thick, course, and curly.  Some areas actually are wirey rather than curly.  I had already washed and just straightened my hair with a vent brush and blow dryer the day before (I can&#x27;t wash every day). Directions said to mist your hair with Bed Head hairspray (of course) mine was already sprayed with Frizz Ease hair spray.  I had not straightened my hair with a flat iron prior to using the deep waver, I had as stated only used the hair dryer and vent brush which straightens my hair but does not make it smoothe by any means at all.  There is a pamphlet with the iron that says it&#x27;s a styling guide.  It is basic directions.  Iron has 3 settings.  Low ~ For Fine Hair, Medium ~ For Normal to Medium Hair, &amp; High For Thick, or Course Hair.  I set the iron on High for my hair type.  Breifly put the hair dryer to my hair again with the vent brush to loosen my hair up as I had had it pulled up for work and there were lines in my hair from the bands used.  I then pulled the top part of my hair up on top of my head, and began using the waver on the underlying layers of hair first.  I used another reviewers tip and put the flatter portion of the iron on the top side of my hair and moved the waver over it section by section.  It took me about 20 minutes to do my entire head which is even faster than using the Instyler (Works as good as the old school Chi Irons that got much hotter than the Chi&#x27;s of today) I also have for straightening.  My hair looks amazing! Wavy, but not tacky.  I just took a section of my hair ran the brush through it again to smoothe.  Started at the root, held for a few seconds and moved down the length of hair.  It was easy to even do the back of my head.  This iron would be perfect for creating cute little updo&#x27;s as well.  My hair is TOTALLY UNRULY AND VERY DIFFICULT usually requiring me to take close to an hour to make a half way tolerable hairstyle after getting out of the shower. Who has that kind of time each day? Not me! So this is a true blessing at an affordable price.  This iron got hot FAST! And made my Do really cute in no time! I&#x27;m sold! I may go ahead and get another one so when it wears out in a couple of years. I won&#x27;t have to worry about tracking down another one :O) Oh yes, some people talked about the size and width of the iron.  It is probably about 2.5 inches wide.  If you have a bob that is at least jaw length you could use this iron.  Just keep in mind after you go over each section you may want to pull on the hair to relax it a bit while it is still hot &amp; your waves won&#x27;t look too big for your length of hair.  I did this to relax the wave that was on my hair part &amp; it worked great. With the rest of my head I let the waves cool completely then fron the underside of my hair ran my fingers through all of my hair to loosen the hair without messing up the outer layer &amp; I came out with smoothe beach wavy hair! So thrilled! Hope this helps everyone!le after getting out of the shower. Who has that kind of time each day? Not me! So this is a true blessing at an affordable price.  This iron got hot FAST!

    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well in my shoulder length hair, but then again my hair doesn&#x27;t curl much in the first place.</li>
    <li> your hair will get stuck in the little edges, and it makes your hair smell</li>
    <li> I highly suggest looking up youtube vids on this waver, I bought it then decided this was probably a good idea before opening, I probably couldve opened it and returned it anyway but I decided not to. ANyways the product from the vids seems to work, but it looks cheesy... in my head I was picturing nice victoria secret kindve hair, but I think its the DEEP part that makes it look cheezy, I think this would only look good on a black girls hair, hope this review helps someone</li>
    <li> I love love my deepwaver it heats great and gives great results very recommened product and very fast shipping well worth every penny! its a must have !!!</li>
    <li> Great product waves hair quickly. Takes some trial an error but worth for a naturally wavy look.</li>
    <li> Did not work, cheaply made and damaging to hair.</li>
    <li> Makes a great shape and heats up pretty quickly. Hadn&#x27;t had an issue with it yet :)</li>
    <li> I love this iron because it gives the perfect mermaid waves! &amp; for a full head of long hair it only takes about 20 minutes to style all of my hair. :)</li>
    <li> It a very nice waver, but it gets dangerously hot (even using it at the lowest temperature). Its kinda easy to use, but hard to get the resuts you are expecting to get. After using it your hair doesn&#x27;t look silky, it looks dry and disorganised. I am not using it as much as I wanted to.</li>
    <li> I had never used a waver before, but this one is very easy to use and worked well on my hair.  I have shoulder-length thick hair that is not quite curly and not quite straight, so the scrunching products and other methods I&#x27;ve used to get a beachy curl haven&#x27;t really worked.  I only had to use this on the top layer of my hair and a few other underneath pieces, with a little hairspray afterwards, and it looks great!  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got burned few times and then stopped using it. Its garbage</li>
    <li> I really wanted to capture the wavy beach hair look and after reading and comparing reviews from Amazon and other sights I felt like this was going to give me awesome hair! HA! It crimps my hair a very little bit while adding lots of volume and a little frizz. It kinda has the Ashley and Mary Kate look but after a few minutes it fros up.So many people love this waver so I truly feel like I am doing something wrong.... But I cant figure out what... Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> This waver was very useful! Although it doesn&#x27;t quite stay as well as when I curl my hair, the wave is a really beachy and cute! I had long hair and I waved it and I looked a bit like Taylor Swift!:) I cut my hair and now it doesn&#x27;t take as long and it is a cute easy look that is so simple that you can just whip up out of thin air. The settings are very accurate so when you set it to high, it is HOT, but otherwise this product is amazing for the price!</li>
    <li> Great beach waves, the best I&#x27;ve used to give me them!  And great price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Always reliable and makes my hair have beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> A must for every beautiful girl works great but dont forget heat protection,, my hair looks like a gypsy !! Charming with long hair and funky with medium hair</li>
    <li> Love this product.  This is a quick and easy way to style my baby fine, flat hair.  The waves really last and the size of the plates is large enough to get through the process very quickly.  I did find that the waves stay put, even after sleeping.</li>
    <li> since this was one of the cheaper hair wavers i wasnt expecting it to be as good, but turns out its AMAZING! i would definitely recommend this to anyone! Its very easy to use also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update! to make the waves come out better, spray a little hair spray on the strand of hair you are about to wave and brush it through until it dries and then wave that section of hair! a few months and this waver is still working perfect!</li>
    <li> Work really well! I suggest that you use small sections of hair, it produces the best waves. My only issue is the waves will not hold in humidity. I have a curl wand and the curls will hold for 2-3 days in humidity!!! All in all, its great for the price!</li>
    <li> I watched many youtube videos before purchasing and I must say I love it! It looks like I just had my hair in braids all night! It&#x27;s so easy to use and the best part is that you can crimp your hair and go to bed and the look holds all day and even into the next! This things is so amazing! I recommend it</li>
    <li> It creates great waves but it is pretty heavy so when you are holding it in the air for a while your arms get really tired!</li>
    <li> This product gives your hair a beach-wave style if you do it right.  Don&#x27;t do each segment of hair exactly the same, and leave a little space between crimped areas so it looks less crimped (80/90s) and more natural/beachy.  My friends liked my hair that way so much they wanted their own wavers and I bought them each one for their Birthdays!</li>
    <li> Finally something that keeps wave in my hair.  This does not do an 80&#x27;s style crimp, but more of a beachy wave.</li>
    <li> This product is good, if your hair is straight, if you have thick or waves, I don&#x27;t recommend it, but not because it didn&#x27;t work for me,  means it won&#x27;t work for you,  try it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I used it on my friends hair. I was pulling it down and it burnt my finger on accident! The burn is still here maybe it will scar. It heats up very well and fast! I recommend this to people who love curls.</li>
    <li> Does the job beautifully</li>
    <li> This is the best hair iron I have ever used. It&#x27;s easy to use, and it even has a heat option. Also it didn&#x27;t take long to get here at all. My friends and I love it. I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Great for wavy hair for dayz</li>
    <li> for the price of this thing, it works wonders !</li>
    <li> I dye my hair and have also had highlights for several years....which makes getting a perm pretty much out of the question for me. My hair is shoulder length (currently trying to grow it out), thin, and fine in texture. This waver makes my hair look AWESOME! Several people have told me that this is the best hairstyle for me and everyone wants to know how the heck I did it! ha ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW...It gets hot super fast and is ready to use in seconds. The waves stay in which is a MAJOR accomplishment for me considering my hair has a hard time holding any curl whatsoever. :) I simply spray a little heat protect stuff on....place the waver and clamp down holding it for about 15 seconds then move on to the next strand of hair. I also have found that using a little bit of hair spray or some time of curl holding spray really makes a difference. Overall I&#x27;m really satisfied with my purchase and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It takes some time to get all my hair done because its really thick but its worth the wait. Thick beachy waves that look natural and last for days. As easy to use as a crimper but looks better because the waves are bigger. I am going to buy 2 more for my nieces for Christmas.</li>
    <li> The waver is really great! It heats up fast and makes really pretty S-shaped waves, and gives your hair a lot of body too. This is a really great price for such an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love this!! My hair is the type that never holds curl. I&#x27;ve used curling wands, irons, rollers... nothing curls my hair and maintains curl throughout the day. This is perfect for the beachy waves everyone wants. My hair is fine, but I&#x27;ve noticed that this doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel rough like a lot of other heated hair tools. It also leaves my hair curly and shiny all day. My only complaint is that getting to the very top of your hair by your scalp is very hard because it does get very hot and it really hurts your scalp. But other than that this is a hair tool I cannot live without!</li>
    <li> I just love this product! It makes my life easier!! Haha!</li>
    <li> This Bed Head Deep Waver is the best!!! It gives you beautiful beach waves that will last all day. However, the only down fall is how it makes your hair smell burned! I just wish it didn&#x27;t make my hair smell a certain but it works well. If you can deal with the smell afterwards then I say get this tool. It works great!</li>
    <li> Bought this after seeing a few youtube.com videos of people using it.  It is very easy to use and helps get a different style.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this item about 2 weeks ago and I decided to use it today and guess what!? It&#x27;s crumpled my hair but after a minute my hair got frizzy and it was horrible. I was really expecting this to be amazing but I guess not. Don&#x27;t get this it&#x27;s a waste money, get the hot tools crumpet it is a little more money but works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, straight hair that&#x27;s often too heavy for a curling iron/rollers. I was a little nervous when I got this product because it seemed like it was just going to \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; my hair, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. I absolutely love this product. It creates natural looking waves that last the entire day - even WITHOUT a helmet of hairspray. It left all of my hair wavy, rather than just curled at the ends like an iron or rollers do. I also have very long hair and it took me a total of 20 minutes to have all of it wavy with this product. It heats up quick with a lot of different settings. I love it! It&#x27;s so simple and fast, and leaves my hair with a LOT of volume. I highly, highly recommend this product :)</li>
    <li> Smells really weird when you turn it on, but it works good and your hair does not smell funny after, very vintage 😍🌺🌻</li>
    <li> I love my deep waver, its awesome if you want sexy beach waves! I&#x27;m a hairdresser, so I&#x27;m always looking for the latest and greatest thing. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this item, you&#x27;ll love it! This seller was great, they shipped it out right away, and it was brand new! If you have any questions on how to use this item, I recommend you tubing it. They have lots of tutorials to show you what the results look like. Have fun creating new styles! God Bless &lt;3</li>
    <li> since this was one of the cheaper hair wavers i wasnt expecting it to be as good, but turns out its AMAZING! i would definitely recommend this to anyone! Its very easy to use also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update! to make the waves come out better, spray a little hair spray on the strand of hair you are about to wave and brush it through until it dries and then wave that section of hair! a few months and this waver is still working perfect!</li>
    <li> Love love love my waver... The perfect wave ❤️❤️</li>
    <li> waves look goood....shows up beettter thenn expecteddd andd stayys deeop withh juss a lil hairspraayy,, and you only need to hold it for about 10-15 seconds deending on how thick of strands you use...</li>
    <li> This is great for waves.  It doesn&#x27;t give you the tiny, crimped, or super curly waves.  Simple and easy to use.  It can take a little while to finish a full head of hair, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair is wavy, but not wavy enough to just let it air dry and wear down. This product fixed my problem. I can now let my hear air dry and quickly style my hair with this and it comes out great! I have VERY thick hair. Like 4 times the amount a normal person has on their head (seriously, my friends and I have compared.) Anyway, the thickness makes it tough to style. This iron gets HOT!!! The first time I used it I had it at the highest heat setting, because that is how I have to use flat irons and curling irons since my hair is so rediculously thick. Well that was a mistake, I looked like Kelly Kapowski! The next time I put it up to 50% and it works PERFECTLY. I get smooth beachy waves that last until I wash my hair (which is about every other day, but the waves would definitely last longer if I didnt wash it for longer). I do not have to use any product in my hair before or after I use this (though I would reccomend a heat protectant if you have fine hair, as this iron gets hotter than lava, I am sure of it). Typically it takes me a long time to curl or straighen my hair, but with this tool I can style it super quickly, like 15 mins to do my whole head! Since it creates beachy casual waves, it does not require prefection. In fact, I think the more imperfection while using this the better. Looks more natural. I dont do all of the layers of my hair becasue it makes my hair too voluminous, but if you have thinner hair it would probably add a lot of body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great produst for beachy, relaxed waves. I highly reccomend, and I get compliments from all of my coworkers whenever I use this on my hair!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this waver!  I have very straight hair that refuses to hold any sort of curl.  With this product the curls lasted all day and looked beautiful.  The only complaint I have is that it gets EXTREMELY hot.  And it is bulky so it is easy to burn yourself by accident.  I just need to get the hang of it.  Besides that I love this waver and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the waves I get from this!  I have to keep the heat turned down or my hair will smell slightly burnt.  Definitely recommend. It is a must have in my hair arsenal.</li>
    <li> This is the only hint that gets my hair to stay wavy! Love it! Wish it had a prop on the handle to weight it down and burning surfaces though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for long hair. I need to wait until my hair will grow, then I will use it.</li>
    <li> I am so picky when it comes to buying any hair products...especially online.Reviews are important to me! :)&lt;br /&gt;Straight up-&amp;quot;BEST DECISION I HAVE MADE and worth every penny! my hair is wavy and fabulous.Compliments.If you want waves this is definitely the product.&lt;br /&gt;I wave my hair within less then an hour,it works,it&#x27;s cute,it doesn&#x27;t have a stand tho so u have to hang it to let it heat up and cool down.The lock to clamp it down it great especially when you have long hair and you hold ur fingers down waiting for it to wave...well the lock clamp gives us a break ladies!:) &amp;quot;phew.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;Love😍</li>
    <li> I bought my daughter this Bed Head Waver for Christmas, she just loves it.She is 13 and uses this all the time.The Waver makes beautiful  long lasting waves.I have had no problem with the way it works and I would definitely recommend this Bed Head Waver to anyone you would not be disappointed in the product.I think the price is just right for it as well.</li>
    <li> Works nice, heats up fast. My hair is shiny and stays curled all day. I don&#x27;t use hair spray or anything with it.</li>
    <li> Amazon has been dragging their feet on helping me get this returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it, it burned my hair when proper steps were taken and left a terrible smell. On top of all that it didn&#x27;t even work for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more heat products for me, such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is the new generation of crimping. Say goodbye to those boring old crimpers and hello to deep waving. Using this item only takes about 30 minutes max to do your entire head and looks awesome. It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
    <li> It was exactly as I was expecting,  I have been using it almost everyday and my hear looks completely fantastic</li>
    <li> at first I hated this. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to wave it, so it sat in my closet for a few weeks. I tried it out again the other day and the waves look amazing! they didn&#x27;t last very long which is probably because of the weather. but I tried using hairspray and they waving it but the crackling noise freaked me out.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. It works great and i also like the teal blue color! It heats up fast and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It is a big gadget but i think its worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and gives beautiful waves to my hair. Heats up extremely fast. Always gets compliments for my hair.Love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair look. The idea is good but it made me look straight out of the 80&#x27;s.... Not beachy waves.</li>
    <li> My hair is really long and this works great.  I have used it on my daughter as well and her pigtails look so cute.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant about this product, as sometimes less expensive products don&#x27;t work for my hair.  I have thick, coarse, long (about three inches above my waist), naturally curly/wavy hair with long layers.  This means:  (without any product in it) it&#x27;s not soft, frizzy, with inconsistent curls in some parts and wave in others.  And after a night sleeping it&#x27;s frizzy in the back pretty badly. With this hair it is best to only wash it every other day, so on that 2nd day it looks awful.  Also, because it&#x27;s heavy, it only starts waving at about my ears, then curls towards the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to find something that would keep it looking pretty much the way it does that first day, when it air dries, but put some wave up a bit higher towards my crown, too.  I had been concerned the heat might not be enough, as it&#x27;s not temperature controlled by specific temperatures.  It has a slider that you \\&quot;dial\\&quot; towards \\&quot;low\\&quot; or \\&quot;high\\&quot;.  Because my hair is so coarse, it takes very high heat to affect it (I normally use 410 on my hair straightener).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works PERFECTLY.  I was able to take it out of the box, use it on my hair, and it looks EXACTLY like it did yesterday after air drying, but with wave all the way up to the top of my head.  The only thing I will change when I do it next time is that I will first insert my section of hair and pull it all the way through THEN start waving it.  It does say this in the directions (which I read afterwards).  That will pull some of the natural curl out first.  My hair came out beautiful :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some of the reviews mentioned that it was too hard to work but I had no problems at all, and my hands are small - and I&#x27;m not freakishly strong or anything.  I did use the highest setting, and I would assume that would burn most people&#x27;s hair, but I&#x27;m Hispanic and my hair absolutely will not curl with anything less than very high heat.  I had to hold the iron on each wave a bit longer than with my straightener, but not a LONG time by any stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am VERY pleased with this purchase, and will use it often.  I would definitely purchase again, and even recommended it to my hair stylist daughter :)ener, but not a LONG time by any stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am VERY pleased with this purchase, and will use it often.  I would definitely purchase again, and even recommended it to my hair stylist daughter :)</li>
    <li> Since I have long hair I was hoping this would be a good Waver but I was wrong. It&#x27;s heavy and the wavy doesn&#x27;t stay long. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I used to work for a very popular beauty supply chain. We didn&#x27;t carry this specific brand, but I very much wish that we did. I&#x27;ve tried many wavers and often times, they leave you with more of a &amp;#34;crimp&amp;#34; or are just plain difficult to use. After trying so many, I just assumed that they were all one and the same. I had doubts about this product. BUT - as it turns out, this one is simple and effective at leaving you with big waves. I have very long, fine, frizzy, processed hair that is wavy/straight. Whenever I straighten my hair, I can&#x27;t get rid of a stubborn wave at the top back part of my hair. With this waver, that wave just blends in and I don&#x27;t worry about it. It actually takes more effort to straighten my hair than it does to use this waver. This makes me so happy because my hair doesn&#x27;t hold style for very long even with heavy duty hairspray. With this waver - it holds waves all day! I suggest using heat protection and a curl or wave cream prior to using this waver. That does mean that you will occasionally need to clean the barrel. If you allow product to build up, you&#x27;re risking a decline in performance of the waver. I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, so I don&#x27;t have to divide my hair as much as I do with a flat iron. If you do divide your hair, you can add a LOT of volume using this waver. I find that this waver doesn&#x27;t contribute to my frizz and actually helps to prevent it a little. I like to run a small amount of curl cream through my hair again after styling to tame frizz and define my waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The biggest factor for me in making this purchase was that you can achieve waves with a flat iron or curling iron, so did I really need this? I have found that the Bed Head Deep Waver is easier, faster and also gives you different results. I use this item often, especially on days that I want to sleep in. Which is a LOT. I highly recommend this waver and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> But the darn thing broke after a few months! :(  Bought in April! Turned it on this morning and no heat.  This is not to say it didn&#x27;t work while I had it but for $20 I couldn&#x27;t at least get 6 months out of it??</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She loves it. It was cheaper here than at the store so that is always a plus for me.</li>
    <li> Really great. I see no reason to spend twice as much on other manufacturers that have the exact same features. The waves are natural, not perfectly symmetrical, and overall using this is way faster than my previous flat iron curl method.</li>
    <li> I love the waves this creates for me. I think it makes it look like you have naturally curly hair! It is easy to use-- you start by clamping the hair at the root, then move down the same strand of hair until you reach the end. It doesn&#x27;t take long, and you can control how loose/tight you want the curls. Love it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great quality!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Works well on my short hair (shoulder length) for loose waves. Was skeptical but stays in pretty well without frizz. Only takes avout 10 minites. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t use the product, it sure made my 15 year old daughter happy. She has used it several times in the past few weeks and has even done other people&#x27;s hair. The neighbor girl is planning on ordering her own. My daughter has pretty thick long hair and the wave stayed in for 2 days (between showers). My own thought is that it seems really bulky, but it makes sense that it has to be in order to have the big waves.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I am the worst at curling hair, or doing anything for that matter! I may as well been a boy for as little effort I put into my hair. But this thing is so easy and works so well. Any hair dummy can use it!</li>
    <li> I really dont think its bad but compared to the pro beauty tool i already have it is not up to my expectations. however if i only had this waver it would get the job done</li>
    <li> Takes way too long to do my hair with this thing.  The videos make it look a lot easier to do than it is.  I do have fine hair, but typically use rusk volume spray which makes my hair grab onto a style.  This was just way too long to do.  I&#x27;m going to try it again this weekend, but if I can&#x27;t get it to work after that, I&#x27;ll just get rid of it.</li>
    <li> My new favorite hair tool! It was a good investment and makes me hair shine and look flawless</li>
    <li> After about a year of wanting one I finally with got this! It came very quickly in the mail andn i love it! I use it a couple times a week with a good heat protection spray and the results are beautiful! The waves last up to the next day if I don&#x27;t wash my hair but i havnt figured out how to style it after sleeping on it. Overall I would highly recommend this product if your looking for a waver and you can&#x27;t quite figure out how to wave with a flat iron like I couldn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> love the waver replaced my revlon standard waver this for sure does the job like the different heat settings and off/on switch</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter who is forever changing her hair styles. She is very pleased with this product and said it cut the time it usually took to achieve look in half when compared to other smaller wavers.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this waver I have hard to curl type of hair and this just helped give me the volume that I needed I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I just want to say that I&#x27;ve tried getting those &#x27;beach waves&#x27; using my straightener. I even purchased an expensive straightener thinking that was why I wasn&#x27;t achieving the waves with my $20 straightener that I already had. However, after wasting my life watching tutorials trying to see different methods (assuming I was doing it wrong) I still never got the quick, PERFECT BEACH WAVES, results that I got with my new Deep Waver. There&#x27;s no special way to do it, heat it up and go. It does was it says it&#x27;ll do and that makes me very happy!</li>
    <li> This product was absolutely amazing! It heated up within just a few seconds and was all ready to use. The clamp was nice and big and none of my hair got caught in it. I pressed the clamp for about 10 seconds an then I got a beautiful wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was an amazing product the only con I have for it is that if you don&#x27;t hold it right you can end up with a nice burn mark:/</li>
    <li> I got it today i try it !! It&#x27;s so cool!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heat is so good and make a good naturaly curls</li>
    <li> We all love this waver!  Adjustable heat for our different hair types!!  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Love this! does my hair in 5 minutes it use to take me forever to do waves with my wand</li>
    <li> I just tried this out for the first time this morning and it&#x27;s exactly what I needed. I have fine, thinning hair and can&#x27;t use a curling iron because chunking my hair and forcing it to separate into curls is a really bad idea. This waver allows me to get nice looking waves without making my hair look even thinner than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off because it gets REALLY hot. I had it on the lowest setting and it was still super hot and there isn&#x27;t any side padding, so it&#x27;s pretty easy to get burned. My hair didn&#x27;t frizz, so at least there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> it works perfectly for my wife hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very hard to hold clamped down,(You could lock it every time?! For 15-20 seconds really?!) I wish it was like a curling iron where it&#x27;s closed until you press to open it. You have to apply much more pressure then you would with a flat iron so for this, only 3 stars. But, when my hair was finally done, it looked amazing.</li>
    <li> Amazing waver to be used on dry hair.. Stays for a long time.. Fast, professional, .. Must buy..cant go to a party without using it</li>
    <li> I believe this iron is better for people with thinner hair.  I have thicker hair and it does not hold the wave...at all.  I followed the directions from the very beginning, and was very disappointed.  I will be giving this iron away.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase! I also have a triple barrel iron. I got this one because I wanted bigger, beachier waves. This works perfect and is easier to use. I have very thin, super straight hair. Usually, my hair does not hold a curl at all. With this, the waves last all day and night and even look good the next day. It is very quick to do and makes my hair look so much thicker. I did my sister&#x27;s the hair the other day and now she wants one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> For 1# This hair waver is little funny to hold in your hand but once you get a hang of it, its not so bad. 2# The waves look amazing but i found that after a day of running my fingers through my hair there wasn&#x27;t much wave left. So i recommend spraying your hair with hair spray before and after styling. 3# I may never where my hair natural again! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this deep waver to do my hair for a costume party and have ended up using it many more times since! I have mid-long length (to the middle of my back) hair and this waver is the perfect size for getting beachy, natural looking waves. I have very thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t hold curl well, so I use this on the highest setting. I also hair spray before I iron, then I hairspray each strand after I iron and then all over at the end. I find this provides for the best hold. Then I use a smoothing shine serum to calm any frizzies that have cropped up during the process. Don&#x27;t grab too hard at the hair if you use a serum-the waves will fall out! They are much more pronounced at the beginning but then loosen up after a little while. If you want more volume, try using the deep waver on a piece of hair at the crown of your head straight on to give lift at the top. Otherwise, for a more subtle look, I do a side part and use the deep waver at an angle down the side of my head, starting at the roots and working all the way down to the tips. There are some great YouTube videos on how to use this product, take a look! I have even used it for flapper style finger waves.</li>
    <li> Not so much for fine hair.  I have baby fine hair that is about to my bra line and this waver does work quite well, however, it just looks crimped.  The iron is too big and too hot to get very close to your scalp, so the roots of your hair stay straight.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for short hair but maybe I need to practice more on my hair.  I have medium to long hair and the top portion of the my head is where it looks funny and way too puffy.  Again, its great with the wave portion and adding a TON of volume but for all over wave it&#x27;s a bit much for me.  What I do like is using the bed head deep waver and then putting my hair in a pony tail b/c the wave looks awesome and the volume helps my hair in keeping my pony tail a little higher on my head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and I love having that one look that everyone tries to get. This is just the thing. I have used it on clients and they love what the look turns out to be. I have also used it in myself and it&#x27;s amazing! If you want a look that will last all day or even two that will give you that great look, this is the tool to get.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I needed a waver product and this gave me more bank for my buck. It works terrific!!! And it is quick and easy :) My hair is full of volume and the waves are beautiful. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I got this on a whim and just absolutely love it! It gives my hair so much volume and is extremely easy to use!</li>
    <li> Cheap material plastic begins to melt after using it on  high heat. Cheap cheap</li>
    <li> Makes my fine straight hair very frizzy and barely wavey.  Should have returned it...</li>
    <li> ok,first of all i never ever review anything i buy even if its good, but this just NEEDED a review because its FRIGGIN awesome.my hair is very thick and curly and due to me being a person of mixed heritage its very hard for me to find anything that can effectively make my hair look decent.this bedhead wave iron saves me lots of trouble and i&#x27;m so glad i bought it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair tool that I own! Very quick and easy to use. I cant say how many compliments on my hair I have gotten when using this and now 5 of my friends and coworkers own it too!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Quick, Easy, and Simple to use! I use a heat protector on my hair first beacuse the product gets very hot!</li>
    <li> Man, this really made my hair legitimately wavy! I used it on my daughter too, and she is raving about it. It heats up quickly, is easy to use and does the job beautifully.</li>
    <li> I love this waver! It is fast and easy. Takes me about 10 minutes to do my hair and I have long medium-thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use, makes beautiful waves, I usually wear my hair straight and sometimes just want something different, this is perfect for that. It looks good the second day also.</li>
    <li> I think the longer your hair is the better this will look on you but I like it enough to use it several times a month.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  It is very easy to use.  I won&#x27;t say my hair at the end of the day looks as good as it did after having used it but that has more to do with my hair than the tool itself.  I did not add hairspray to help keep it going either.  The hair towards the nape generally does not hold any curl at all but with this I can still see some of the waves.  It took about an hour to use this all over my head, I have long hair so I expected it would take that long.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this. Super easy to use and man did it make my hair look so good. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a really good waver. I have really thick hair and it waves it perfectly. If you can do it in sections (under to top) it works so much better. I would, and have, recommended this to my lady friends.</li>
    <li> Love this waver. It only takes a few minutes to do my whole head! And my hear looks chic and boho.. :)</li>
    <li> Love this! The waves hold great and my whole head is done quickly since it does big sections. The price is great and its a great brand.</li>
    <li> It curls better than a curling iron and is way easier to use</li>
    <li> I like the product alright, but it isn&#x27;t perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waves look alright right after being done, but do start to drop pretty quickly, even when using product. However, the residual waves are still pretty.&lt;br /&gt;The item has these little grip lines built into the plastic where you hold it closed. They really start to hurt your thumb and fingers when you have to hold the thing closed repeatedly for a while.&lt;br /&gt;The black end is too hot to hold in order to use both hands to hold the thing closed. They blunt the heat a bit, but not enough to not burn you if you hold them for more than a few seconds.</li>
    <li> I have kind of wavy hair but it is frizzy.  I have  some straight parts too.  not a good look.  This makes my hair uniform and wavy.  Easy to use too.</li>
    <li> this arrived on time and works very very good. if your thinking about purchasing it then i would say dont wait just go ahead and buy it you wont be disappointed. the price is okay i saw one for cheaper if you go to target for only 19.99 but maybe walmart has it too.  all in all i am very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Love this item!! Creates great looks! I just need to use it more.</li>
    <li> My hair is super, super straight, and never wants to keep a curl.  I&#x27;ve tried everything I know to get volume AND that lovely beach-tousled wave - rollers, velcro rollers, numerous gels/sprays/mousse/shampoo &amp; conditioner.... nothing has worked to achieve what I had envisioned in my head.  Then I found this waver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I first found out about it through a pin on Pinterest.  When I&#x27;d read all the reviews on Amazon and saw the pictures people had uploaded, it sounded like it was exactly what I had been looking for.  I purchased it but still kept my reservations... I&#x27;ve been disappointed SO many times on things that secretly I thought this would be the same outcome.  I was so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine is PERFECT for getting big waves!  As I mentioned before, my hair never wants to take a curl, but I can use this on the same day that my hair is washed without any product in it to help keep the wave.  Depending on how tightly you close the clamps around your hair, you can get a tight crimp or a soft wave.  I&#x27;ve used hairspray first to help set and then no product at all until all my hair is waved and then use mousse to help seal the curls.  Any way works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little bit to get used to - I have found that you really have to take care to line the edge of the waver up to the last wave you did, otherwise your waves will be misshapen and a bit odd looking.  Also, I have very long hair (a little below mid-back) and a lot of it, and it takes me 45-50min to do my entire head.  It takes a while but it is well worth it; every time I wave my hair I get compliments from people.  Also the waves last for LONG time.  I&#x27;ve gone four days with the waves using dry shampoo in between and the waves look just as awesome as they did on the first day.  Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love the Bed head deep waver, I love it so much, makes my hair perfect for that beach look.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and this was easy to use! I have had so many compliments on my hair when I use it. Definitely worth the investment! :)</li>
    <li> This does not work! I turned it on MAX level but still my hair does not make any wave. I tried other products from bedhead before and this one is the worst! Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I still have mine laying around somewhere at home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a waver before, or curlers or anything.  I thought this would be a good entry into the world of hair appliances, beyond the basic hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched a lot of YouTube videos on how to use it, and figured I was good to go.  My hair was dry, I sprayed it with heat protectant and off I went to wave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh.  It was a total pain in the booty to use.  There was no way I could do the back of my head and I was burning myself regularly attempting to keep the curls aligned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was done, it was loose and just barely waved.  My hair curls fairly easily and I was really disappointed in the result.  I also felt like this did immediate and significant damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that some of the issues I had may be due to inexperience, but honestly it&#x27;s just too much of a pain to attempt repeatedly.  I can find other, easier,  ways to get the curls I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I just received this today and I do not like it at all! I watched many YouTube videos on it and the waves came out amazing. However, when I used it, it happen to smell bad. Also, my hair is medium/thick ( I have a lot of hair ) and the waves came out okay but made my hair super poofy. I also have shoulder length/ to my collarbone length. Like I said, since I have no use for it and do not like the smell, I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> Cute!! I feel like it gives adorable little waves, and does it pretty quickly as well. The reason for 4 stars is the handle is HUGE. I have small hands, and you have to squeeze the handle tightly to get a good wave to form. I think that if the handle was smaller or maybe a little more ergonomic, it would be perfect. Other than the handle, this is a great tool!</li>
    <li> I love this tool! It gives me the curls I&#x27;ve been trying to imitate my entire life. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> this works really great, def beach waves</li>
    <li> Meh. It&#x27;s okay. The curls don&#x27;t hold very long, and I never have been able to get the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; waves from this waver. Perhaps with more hairspray and more patience I&#x27;d be more successful. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times due to my lack of satisfaction of the end result.</li>
    <li> Love it very easy to use</li>
    <li> It burned my daughters hair. it will be going back asap&lt;br /&gt;she really wanted this but it just didnt live up to what it was suppose to do</li>
    <li> i love my deep weaver.  It has made curling my hair so fast and so easy.  I have long hair and can do my whole head in about 15 minutes, start to finish and easily look like I spent an hour doing my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves how her hair came out ...</li>
    <li> I use this at least once a week. It heats up super quick and crimps hair beautifully! Beware though-- it gets super hot. I burned the back of my neck and it left a scar.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I was a little skeptical that it wouldn&#x27;t wave my hair at all. I tried it right when it came in the mail. It waved my hair perfectly and it stayed in until I took a shower the next day, but even after the shower it was still loose waves. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. You wouldn&#x27;t regret buying!</li>
    <li> I love it and it was delivered very fast.</li>
    <li> This works equally well on my thick, coarse, wavy hair and on my daughter&#x27;s straighter, more fine hair.  Using this to make my hair a little wavy is much quicker than using a straightener!</li>
    <li> I received this less than a week ago and have used it everyday. I love it so far. I know others have stated that theirs stopped working after a few months. If that&#x27;s the case I will update my review. Until than, my opinion stays the same.</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected. Now that my hair is finally long enough, I can&#x27;t get enough of using this product.</li>
    <li> Straight to the point. Yes! it works, it works wonderfully except the fact that it releases a strong oder &amp; it leaves my hair smelling that way. Plus when you&#x27;ve been using this on your hair for about 10 minutes or more the grip part starts getting extreamly hot if you have it all the way on High heat. I can barely take the heat but maybe for someone who has sensitive hands you might feel like your hands are on fire. Which is why I gave this product 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought both this and another curling iron at the same time (the Bio Ionic rotating) and to be honest with you I love this one so much I haven&#x27;t really used the other one (that was twice as expensive!!). It&#x27;s fast, gets really hot, and the waves last forever even through a sleep. My boyfriend loves the look it gives and when I wave my hair and go to work I get so many compliments it&#x27;s crazy. So super easy. If you&#x27;re still not sure, look for videos on YouTube and watch some of the videos...these give a really good idea how to use the tool and show how easy and fast it is. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after watching videos and researching what would be the best wave iron. This one had good reviews and looked easy to use. I received it quicker that anticipated and tried it out right away. It worked very well and I didn&#x27;t even have it on the highest heat setting. The problem is with my hair, not the product. My hair is really thick and it ended up making my hair really &amp;#34;poufy&amp;#34; which I didn&#x27;t want. The waves came out pretty cool though! It has a locking mechanism also to keep it closed when not in use which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, Returning this item was super easy and they gave me a return label to print out and I dropped it off at UPS store. They already processed my refund, even though they have not received the item back yet. Very happy with Amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use on my granddaughters hair and it works great!  It makes beautiful deep waves which last over a day without using any styling products. It heats quickly and is very well made.  However my biggest complaint is the ENTIRE iron heats up so you can&#x27;t get very close to the scalp. Also it is kind of front heavy and there is nowhere to hold it closed so if you have any weakness in your grip you won&#x27;t be able to close it tightly on your hair. I would definitely recommend this purchase keeping those things in mind. By the way, we also own the Bedhead crimper and use their shampoos so we are quite happy with their product line (and price point!) in general.</li>
    <li> good quality for what you pay for.</li>
    <li> a good product as expected and very good would that offered a gift for each product purchasing and so motivate more users 100% recommend this particular product</li>
    <li> I received my deep waver in the mail a few days ago and absolutely love it! I have fine hair, and this gives my hair the appearance of being thicker. It gives me beautiful beach waves that I haven&#x27;t been able to get with other irons! So happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Great for both me and my daughter!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I don&#x27;t know how to curl my hair, this is really simple and looks really good! Takes me about 30 min to do my whole head. I would recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This item is great! I have straight hair and it gives me beautiful waves. I get tons of compliments! Definitely worth the price! The ONLY thing is that it has these small 5 plastic lines molded on the part that you hold to squeeze down and they start to hurt your hand after a while but other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I use it every morning, and never get tired of it. I recommend this to anyone who loves to do their hair to try this product. It&#x27;s super easy to use. Plus, my daughter loves it just as much. I had to order one for her! RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE TO TRY!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and does work</li>
    <li> Well, it definitely gave me waves....Just hope I don&#x27;t burn my hair from the heat as I have highlighted hair....It really looks beautiful after I use it!  Does what it says!</li>
    <li> This thing stopped working after third use😒</li>
    <li> This works well enough, but took me forever to do my whole head because I have so much hair. For someone with a normal amount of hair I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d love it.</li>
    <li> This is great for making nice curls. I found that if you turn it upside down, the curls come out better.</li>
    <li> Awesome !!  My hair turns out like my natural waves !!  Really good on long hair</li>
    <li> Simple to use, works quickly and well. Once done run some wax through your hair and you have the perfect beach wave look!</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time yesterday. Not impressed. I was so hopeful because there were so many positive reviews. I have very thick, long hair, that frizzes very easily. A lot of people said it worked great on their thick and long hair. I used this on very SMALL sections because of the thickness. I held it quite awhile on each section all the way to the end. Obviously it took forever, but that wasn&#x27;t the problem. As soon as I was done, the sections I first started on were straight and frizzy! Like I hadn&#x27;t even done anything! And yes, I used the correct product to prevent frizzy and straight hair. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Another useless hair tool to add to the pile.</li>
    <li> Actually worked on my super straight hair!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very fun to hold, all the buttons and whatnot are where I hold, but I can deal.&lt;br /&gt;Came super fast too!</li>
    <li> I love the results I get with this deep waver. Just don&#x27;t get it too close to your scalp. When you squeeze it together it tends to pull towards your hairline. I surprised myself a couple times feeling the heat.</li>
    <li> Awesome waver!!! I have fine hair and this waver will wave my hair in less than 30 seconds. I also tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair which is thick and a lot. And it worked just as well on hers, just taking an extra 10 secs. Waves lasted on both of us for 2 days till of course we washed our hairs. :-) I would recommend this waver to everyone!!!❤️ I&#x27;m very happy shopping on Amazon, I always receive what I expected and always fast shipped. I&#x27;m a very happy Amazon costumer!</li>
    <li> Hard to use and maneuver and I keep burning my fingers ..... bad buy on my end.</li>
    <li> I have long (to the middle of my back) naturally super straight hair that normally doesn&#x27;t hold curl or shape. This waver is fantastic! Heats up quickly, has adjustable heat settings, and gives my hair waves that last all day and into the next day! I get lots of compliments when I use this. Its easy to use and gives pretty, polished, beachy waves! Love, love, love this!</li>
    <li> Once I got used the heating element it works great! My hair stays wavy for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I have burned myself 2 times with this deep waver, one made a burn mark on my hand.  Another thing is.....it is heavy to hold. I have had this for over a year and the thing that locks it is broke. The only thing that i do like is the way it waves my hair, but the cons outweigh the pros.  There are other ones out there i don&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
    <li> my HAIR IS PAST MY BUTT ALL ONE LENGTH , thin BUT TONS OF IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This REALLY WORKS WITH MY HAIR I think it will work in any hair you can dial down to adjust heat too I luv It and the waves are beachy , and the waves stayed till nxt hair washing !!!</li>
    <li> I wanted this product so bad, so I had to have it. But when I had ordered it I had used it ONCE .. but now when I try using it, it turns on but doesn&#x27;t heat up anymore. Very disappointed, I loved the results too but sucks how it stopped working.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;OMG&amp;#34; I love💜💜💜 this Deep Waver it is Amazing. It makes my hair look so Good, i would recommend this for anyone to purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the look this gives -- it looks like a natural type of wave. Best of all Amazon has them in stock. I&#x27;ve looked at 3 places and this item is NEVER in stock!  My only complaint is that it takes quite a while to do the whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does really last a few days and actually looks better on day 2!</li>
    <li> I cant think of one bad thing about this waver. I absolutely love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and it does exactly what the video demonstrated. It leaves nice deep natural looking waves in my hair. I can even go to bed and wake up the next day with a soft wave still in my hair. I use it on the hottest setting and the handle is still ok to hold on to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair as it is but it gets frizzy at times...I wanted to use something that would help straighten and give the curl back...this was not what expected and I quickly returned.  It just did not seem to do anything but make my hair wavy up top, frizzy in the middle and like straw at the bottom.</li>
    <li> I love this styling tool -- it totally works, and I&#x27;m terrible at doing my hair! I have very thick hair that DOES NOT hold curl well at all, especially here in the humid South. With this waver and an ample amount of hair spray, I can get the waves to hold all day.</li>
    <li> Shipped sooner than I expected! I love the bright color and heats fast. I have thick straight hair. If you want nice fancy  waves, iron your hair flat then use the waver. Unless you want messy natural beach waves: spray Beach Chic texturizing spray before using waver.</li>
    <li> She likes it, it was cheaper than what we could buy locally, even with shipping, what more can a dad ask for?</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s a cool thing...! i like the result of waves very much. hair is getting a cool waved shape, not curly. the only problem was, that i had to buy a converter to use this tool in europe. (didn&#x27;t think of that when i bought it) but with this one it works perfectly. i also like that you are able to choose the heat from low to high, as for my hairtype the low-setting is enough. this deep waver is also very easy to handle. would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am soooo in love with this! I have thick long hair and this makes my hair look amazing!! It does get a little hot and theres no place to hold your other hand to help support it but other than that its amazing!!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before purchasing, focusing on women who have thick hair. I can honesty say I have the thickest hair of any woman I know and I have A LOT of it which makes heated hair products a hit or miss game. My method is extremely time consuming but is the only method that yields results for my hair type and that is waving SMALL sections at a time. Your hands will ache and your eyes will cross but at the end, you will have big, wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to point out that many pictures associated with this product are on girls with thin-medium hair which looks gorgeous but will never be my outcome and I just have to be realistic in that notion. I used to envy women with thinner hair which appears to be so much easier to style but I&#x27;ve since come to accept the lioness mane God blessed me with and this waver helps me achieve that look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the product itself, it&#x27;s heftier than a curling iron so be prepared to take breaks and stretch out your hands. The hottest setting was very hot which is what I needed and I had to be very cautious not to burn myself. I imagine the best results would come from someone else doing your hair but that&#x27;s just the idealistic side of me speaking. I don&#x27;t have experience with other wavers to compare this to but the price is good so I would recommend this to friends to try.</li>
    <li> Makes hair looks more crimped than curls as advertised. I was Hoping for a better quality curler than what I reveived</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American and have med length very thick hair and this works great!  I receive many compliments when I wave my hair with this iron.</li>
    <li> It is super easy to use and a super fast to &#x27;fix up&#x27; your hair.  I would recommend this to anyone with long hair</li>
    <li> I really liked the waver. It creates cute flowy waves and looks great on long hair. However, this product stopped working after 2 months. It turns on but doesn&#x27;t heat up anymore. AND it&#x27;s too late to return it.</li>
    <li> This works great to make your hair wavy. My teenager like using it all the time. I thought it was a bit bulky and would take a bit to get use to using but other than that it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not only really simple to use, it takes about 15 minutes for me to do my entire head and I have somewhat thick hair. I get compliments on my hair all the time especially for dates and parties.</li>
    <li> super easy to use, Im not really good at doing hair and this makes it soooo easy to do! it gives a really nice beach wave</li>
    <li> iT DIDN&#x27;T LOOK THAT BIG ON LINE BUT UPON DELIVERY IT WAS SO BIG AND BULKY IT WAS HARD TO WORK WITH AND TIRESOME BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE. I USED IT SO I FAILED TO RETURN IT BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD NOT USE AGAIN. WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY. I DID NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT AT ALL. MABEY IF IT WERE MINI SIZED OR SOMETHING IT WOULD PROVE TO BE OF BETTER USE TO ME.. SO NO I WOULDN&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS AGAIN</li>
    <li> I love having my hair curly but I am terrible at curling my hair and don&#x27;t have the time for it so I bought this product. In less than 20 minutes my hair looked amazing! It looked great the next day too and I got so many compliments. I love this product and am so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> This made my hair super frizzy...I have very long hair and the barrel was way too small. Not a beachy wave like it says</li>
    <li> I have butt length very thick hair that&#x27;s very hard to curl. I normally would braid my wet hair at night to achieve waves the next day but this is amazing. The waves last for days so you don&#x27;t have to do it every day maybe just a touch up.</li>
    <li> LOVE this!!!! I have thick hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders.  It is wavy also.  This waver is so simple to use and it doesn&#x27;t take me long to do all of my hair!  I used it out in vegas and even with the dry hair it seemed to hold really well!  I also used some hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great too.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love! Great wavy hair made easy! Does not dry our hair great change for a while! Great buy!</li>
    <li> When I saw video reviews about this product, it was all positive! I was so excited! It came right on time. I was pleased with this purchase! It does what it says it does, it&#x27;s just so amazing! Only thing I recommend for people that don&#x27;t have straight her and wanna use this product, straighten your hair first and then use the bed head waver , if you don&#x27;t then your hair will be a little frizzy</li>
    <li> It was ok at first… but not a month of having it the thing broke. Not what i was wanting and didn&#x27;t really do the job for short hair, the con air waver is the best! So pick that one!</li>
    <li> When I first it looked huge. So I was a little intimidated. Anyways opened and used it right away . Beautiful deep waves.**tip**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a serum or some type of hold spray or mist. Hold for more than 10 seconds on each point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Find the last crinkle and clamp down from there. All the way to the bottom to have consistency in the waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run fingers through when done spray or add serum over and absolutely LOVELY!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did mine to quickly the first time no serum like5 second on each part. It just looks like a wavy poof. So if you do it right and take your time. The hair will be beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ready for summer :-)</li>
    <li> Love this! I have super thick hair and had trouble finding a deep waver that actually took to my coarse straight hair and this is It. I&#x27;m a hairstylist of 6 years and this is a great styling tool wether it&#x27;s everyday hair or to go out or even to set the hair for a messy updo!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, and she loves it. She has long, thick hair. This waver enables makes it easy for her to create beautiful waves fairly quickly, and they stay in all day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted deep waves and didn&#x27;t know there was a waver tool out there. This works as great as high end flat irons, only for a wavy style. Love it!</li>
    <li> This waver is great! I had a similar one before, and was not impressed. It wasn&#x27;t a deep waver, so with my super thick hair it basically just provided a crimped effect and made me look like either a baby lion or someone straight out of the 80&#x27;s. But this one is great. Natural looking waves that don&#x27;t look crimped or fried. It also was surprisingly fast to do considering how much hair I have. After using this on dry hair, I  used some sea salt spray and a bit of hair spray on top of that to seal it all in. Voila, beachy waves!</li>
    <li> I bought this, wanting waves like Shakira&#x27;s. Lol! I am not good at curling my own hair with a curling iron, I have long, very fine hair, and lots of it. I have trouble getting it all with a curling iron, I miss spots, I have to do tiny sections to get it to hold, it just takes forever, so I usually opt for the straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this waver the first time when I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere , in case I didn&#x27;t like the results. I separated my hair into layers and went to work. Looked great and stayed wavy throughout the next day! I did my hair with this for a concert tonight and got several compliments! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product!</li>
    <li> Very fun and easy to use. My husband loves my hair after using this.</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair, if I leave it wet and put in some mousse, I can get a little wave, but I wanted more waves or curls. I thought this would just make my hair look like a bunch of waves, but it didn&#x27;t, it looked like I had a bunch of amazing curls!!! All I did was spray on some heat protectant, which i use sally hanson, I can&#x27;t remember the name of it, but it&#x27;s a pump spray, biege color bottle with a picture of a curling iron on it, it really makes my hair so soft! And made my new wave curls look so good!! And a great price!!!</li>
    <li> Great for making wavy hair!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, looks exactly like picture. Came in a package like it came from a store which is great. Works awesome!,</li>
    <li> Doe exactly what It says on the box, I have very fine hair and it works dreat.. Unbelievably fast delivery, amazing teal colour. Totally worth the money</li>
    <li> Does what is says. Hold for about 10 seconds and you&#x27;ll achieve the hair style you desire. This hairstyle can last several days unless washed out. :) I have thin hair, so for me I&#x27;m only going to hold the iron on my hair for 5 seconds and I get the same result. Also because I don&#x27;t want a ton of volume and poofy hair. I think it also looks cute to make low braids after you style for mermaid wave braids. :) Product arrived on time. In packaging and new as ordered. It heats up quick. Easy to use. This was my first time using this product and buying a waver iron. I really like it!</li>
    <li> Took much time to hold iron in place and repeat process throughout my long hair.  Wand is heavy and was awkward for me to use.</li>
    <li> It is a great product! Everyone asks me about it, even hairdressers. I use it all the time. It is easy to use!</li>
    <li> Arrived in 2 days, amazing price, perfect packing. Half price compared to retails stores. Would surely recommend this to all but better models available online!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used wavers or 3 barrels in the past and didn&#x27;t get the look like this one has accomplished.  When I first used it my 3 year old daughter said, &amp;#34;Wow mommy!  I love your hair... you look like Taylor Swift.&amp;#34;  Taylor Swift is her idol and now she wants me to do her hair with it every day.</li>
    <li> My wife is a hair stylist and saw this online.  Best price we could find was on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Very well built curling iron and keeps you up with the latest trend!</li>
    <li> Seriouslu a great product. Did my own hair for my wedding and itgave me that romantic soft wavy look. I didnt want curls because i felt their overrated? I wanted a softer look and not to mention this little magic wand help me achieve this for just $20!!! Are you kidding me?!!! My hair do wouldve cost $65 at a salon!!! No thanks!!! Love my wave artist and now all my girlfriends want one :)</li>
    <li> This was originally going to be a gift for my daughter but after I got it I had to open it and try myself. I have not installed the safe around my cosmetics, beauty tools or clothes yet so it will eventually become lost and in her possession anyway so whatever...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have long straight hair and this really made it look like I had perfect wavy hair, just without the work. It has a high and low setting, it has been a week since I tried it but think the setting choice was a dial without numbers so it took me a minute to figure out which way was which. Great styling tool</li>
    <li> My wife had this on her wishlist and i got it for her without her realizing it... she was totally surprised... oh and yeah, her hair looked amazing after she used it...She loves it and i love how she looks after using it... :)</li>
    <li> I really like this wave iron. It gets really hot.  When buying the product, the description says that it gets 400 degrees.  No where on the iron or in the included brochure that came with the iron, did it say &amp;#34;400 degrees&amp;#34;.  It works great on straight and curly hair types though.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for christmas and she uses it alot.  She loves it.  Gives her nice waves that actually hold.  All you need is a little hairspray.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great and heats up very quickly.  It is easy to use and makes my long hair look nice with long waves.</li>
    <li> I love it, its easy to use and the results looks amazing like a professional hair styler did it !!!!! I am Happy that i got it&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it !!!!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter uses this at least twice a month! She loves having lose waves in her hair for school. Easy to use. Only down fall it is top heavy and arms could get sore!</li>
    <li> I got this waver 2 years ago and it has worked really well since then. I have naturally curly voluminous hair and it is treated with a mild relaxer twice a year to reduce volume and turn the curls/waves a little bit more even. In a daily basis it is enough to dry out the hair using a diffuser to keep it in shape.&lt;br /&gt;  I use the Bed Head Deep waver mainly when the root of my hair is growing appearant so that the transition area is less evident. I also use it when I want curls more organized and It is also possible to add or reduce the volume to the overall look by clamping more or less hair and sectionning it also vertically (not only horizontally as in the seller&#x27;s video). Now that I&#x27;m experienced with it I really clamp the hair as close as possible to the scalp to reduce the &amp;#34;bumpy effect&amp;#34; that the model on the video has (I particularly find it very artificial, but is a matter of &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34;) and produce a more natural &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; look. The waves last a lot, even using only thermal protector, and though it is not a portable product it would not take much luggage space.&lt;br /&gt;  As soon as I started using the tool I had problems adjusting its temperature once it has a kind of &amp;#34;high -low&amp;#34; dial/disk to adjust it. Though I knew it  before buying I didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem until I started using. This dial is the reason why I removed one star: 1) one doesn&#x27;t know which temperature options the waver offers and I consider it crucial in modern iron tools 2) the dial is placed on the bottom of the tool what made me move it many times during the waving process.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall the product is great and I would recommend it. Considering the price, Bed Head Deep Waver is the best choice if you are looking for a deep wave look!</li>
    <li> I received this and it&#x27;s okay.  I have fine hair and it does make waves but nothing to brag about.</li>
    <li> I believe that since my hair is layered and shoulder length, this waver didn&#x27;t work well for me. I was so hopefully. Takes some getting use to. Burnt my hand the first time using it.</li>
    <li> To awkward and heavy to use for me. I like the old school ones!! Sent it back with no problem!! Amazon is as usual AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> I love this item! I have pin straight hair and it gives me the beach wave look that lasts for the day with no mouse or hair spray.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of months ago, and love love love it! I have very thick hair, but it works beautifully on my hair. I don&#x27;t ever lock it while its hot, so I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it melting or warping.</li>
    <li> Very dangerous piece of junk. It&#x27;s all metal and it gets really hot all over. There is no way not to get burned.</li>
    <li> Not suitable for 220v. Seller didn&#x27;t inform about that.</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend &amp; she loves it!</li>
    <li> this is a waver that&#x27;s very easy to use. a product that lives up to it&#x27;s promises. use a heat protectant and styling mousse.. and voila!! you have a long lasting beautiful curls and beachy waves look. Great buy! ahhluveeet!!!!!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> While I love this for my hair that is thin but curly, my daughter who has thick long hair had more trouble using it.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I purchased. The first one was for my youngest daughter who loves it. My oldest loved it so much she wanted her own. Gives great curls in a short time! Not like crimping!</li>
    <li> I really tried to make this work , I tried many times many ways but unfortunately it did nothing good to my thick hair. This just fried and frizzed my hair no matter what I put or how long I use. I have really thick hair so maybe this was the problem the waves just looked like 80s crimped hair.</li>
    <li> Best waver ever! Highly recommend it. I purchased it 3 times already for me and friends, who are also excited!</li>
    <li> Great item.  Gives the wave I desire and easy to use.  Has multiple temperature settings and a lock to keep it closed</li>
    <li> It made most of my hair look burned. and and made it look like a frizzy dry mess especially in the back where my hair is very thick.</li>
    <li> Love this. Watch a YouTube for quick tutorial. I only wish I had bout it here! I paid $35 at Ulta! :(</li>
    <li> Only used this a few times. I have really thick hair...this seemed to make my hair frizzy and the waves didn&#x27;t last at all</li>
    <li> Great natural curl.  Easy on dry, frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Took a few tries to get the hang of it, but it is AMAZING! Love the way my hair looks after using it.</li>
    <li> not as strong as would have liked; curls/waves ok but not great.</li>
    <li> I loved this! I have super straight hair so at the end of the day it&#x27;s falling out but that&#x27;s just my hair. A great purchase and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it and the waves last until you wash your hair! We did have to hold the section in the iron for 5-8 seconds but it works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!  Love it! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I really liked this until it stopped working as other reviews said. I only had it 2 months and I can&#x27;t return it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to have the wavy look and the best way I used to do it is sleeping with my braids at night. This does the trick great and everyone loved how it looked! I recommend buying if you want the wavy look! However, I would say this would work best for women with LONG hair, not so much short.</li>
    <li> This hair tool is fast and easy to use and works on my thick, coarse hair. Anyone can use this product.</li>
    <li> love it  what more can I say, it works.....so buy one....ok....when it works that&#x27;s all that matters so buy one.</li>
    <li> The waver heats up very quickly, makes beautiful waves and is a very good price. My teenage daughters love it!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product, I sent it back.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair that does not hold curls without a lot of product. I wanted a change from my everyday straight style, so I purchased the Bed Head Deep Waver. LOVE IT! It takes the same amount of time to make my hair wavy with this iron that is does to smooth my hair with my flat iron. I use minimal hairspray and the waves last all day! I get lots of compliments when I use my waver. It was a great, inexpensive way to change up my look.</li>
    <li> I love this hair iron!  It is a great brand and it delivers spectacular results!  Highly recommend this hair iron!</li>
    <li> It does what it states, but it is not for my hair.  I have very thick, course hair and it comes out pretty big.  Thinner hair would benefit from this iron more than me.</li>
    <li> BEACH HAIR!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Does what it suppose to!!!! I should&#x27;ve gotten a smaller barrel due to can not get as close to scalp on top. Barrel gets extremely hot so need to be super cautious when styling the hair around neck and scalp! But other than that it&#x27;s a quick fix to hair that isn&#x27;t working out in the morning. Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love what this does to my hair. I have frizzy, wavy, thick hair. The wave it so pretty. I can see how you can get a crimped look if you don&#x27;t do this right. I went to youtube and they have all these people that give tutorials. I watched a couple and it was super easy and the result was great.</li>
    <li> I got sick of blow drying my hair and then using rollers to get large, loose curls. WIth the Deep Waver, I can allow my naturally wavy yet also frizzy hair air dry and then use this to create defined, attractive waves that also add a lot of body to my hair. This has quickly become my favorite hair tool of all time. I like that you can adjust the level of heat and that it&#x27;s so user friendly and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This deep waver is the best thing I have ever used for bouncy curls considering&lt;br /&gt;my hair is straight. The curls last all day and I love it.  I highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;waver as it is very easy to use.  .</li>
    <li> I have very long thick hair so after reading a few reviews saying that they loved this product and that it worked great on thick hair I purchased this. I received it faster then I had anticipated so when I got it I used it right away I was so happy with it, it did exactly what I had been looking for . The next morning I went to use it again. Plugged it in and started to use it , then it started to make strange noises and then a blue spark shot out of it and it started to smoke right by the power switch . I was lucky enough I wasn&#x27;t holding it or I would have been shocked or burned .. So disappointed</li>
    <li> Nice quality, worked well - my daughter had it plugged in and was using it within minutes of opening the gift at Christmas.</li>
    <li> Ive never loved a styling tool more than this. love that it has a lock feature for easier storage. Gets really hot really quickly. Easy to use and your waves come out GORGEOUS &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I give the Bed Head Deep Waver a strong 4. When first purchasing this product, I didn&#x27;t expect much of it due to its price. However upon first usage, I fell in LOVE with it. The waves eventually fall out throughout the day, just like any other wavers I&#x27;ve used. My hair is long and thin and the waves last for a good 7-9 hours (different textures and types of hair may vary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some bad aspects of this tool is the bulk, the unknown heat temperature, and the clamp does not close all the way. Your arm may begin to feel sore after styling one part of your hair. The only heat setting it provides you with is low and high. When locked, the clamp still moves around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, I do recommend this tool to many customers. It is preferred for those with longer and thinner hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My daughter had to have this &amp; I love how her hair looks after using this. Waves look &amp; stay amazing ! Compliments from everyone.Would expect to pay so much more &amp; it arrived fast. Don&#x27;t hesitate or buy any other brand. This is the ultimate waver !</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair that tends to go flat in humidity so I bought this waver to perk it up a little and give it a more uniform wave.  I think this is best used on hair that is below shoulder length as it really poofs up quite a bit - if you want volume, this will give it to you.  I sectioned my hair and did lower layers, then upper.  For the best look, start waving right at the top curve of your head  - don&#x27;t go too close to the scalp or it will look too poofy.  Then just run your fingers through to separate a little and it will look perfect!  If you mess up, don&#x27;t worry - just throw it back in a ponytail, it really looks great that way.  Took me about 3 tries to get the hang of it but I love it now!</li>
    <li> shipped on time. does a good job, but can burn. better 4 long hair then short hair. takes a while 2 use on ur hair. keep in mind i have only used it 2 maybe 3 times in a 1 month period.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use it for my wedding rehearsal dinner, and I was very happy with how my hair looked. I have only used it that one time, but I use all Bed Head products and I love them all. This is a perfect item to add to my collection!</li>
    <li> Works really great for me and my hair looks so amazing after using it. It&#x27;s so easy to style my hair now and put some sexy wave on my dull and boring hairstyle.</li>
    <li> This waver is good. It has the open and lock button then the light where it glows when its on. The on and off button then the how high and low you want it to be hot. It gives you waves instantly. Mine takes a little bit longer because my hair is thick and wavy already even though my waves are way smaller but does not take more than a minute to make waves. And you can see how big the waves are. I have short hair so I think this will look better in long hair !just my opinion!</li>
    <li> Awesome waver for the price!! Works fast and flawless! Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a waver but never really got around to it. I used to wave my hair with a flat iron but never was completely satisfied with the results as I felt it made my hair too frizzy. Alas, I began my search online for the best deep waver and stumbled upon the Bed Head Wave Artist. I was a bit skeptical at first because of the low price but after reading a mountain of great reviews and watching tutorials on youtube, I decided to finally try it out. I live in Canada and searched for it at Target and Walmart but wasn&#x27;t able to find it anywhere. That&#x27;s when I found it on Amazon and placed my order. Standard shipping only took two days which I was very happy about and as soon as it arrived I needed to try it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that the waver felt very durable and of good quality. When I plugged it in, it heated up very fast, taking only about 1-2 minutes. I set it on the highest heat setting because I like my waves to be very defined. I sectioned off my hair and took about a one inch strand and clamped it down for 5 or 6 seconds, making my way down where the previous wave left off. It took about 20 minutes to do my whole head (my hair is on the medium-thick side, and long) and the result was beautiful, crisp, defined waves. The other reviewers aren&#x27;t joking when they say this gives you a ton of volume, and that is another thing I love about this thing, my hair has never looked so voluminous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This waver definitely feels like a professional styling tool, it feels of much higher value than what the price is actually is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite hair product, and I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for a deep waver.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick with long layers. Styling takes some time and practice- I&#x27;m getting better, and with that the results are better each time.  I wish there wasn&#x27;t such a learning curve, and it being so time consuming.  For me the style does not hold to the next day if I sleep on it, but it does hold well throughout the day that it is done, including humid days. The look comes out like beachy waves.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!  It was so simple to use and I am in love with the results!</li>
    <li> Love this! It took me quite long to do a good job the first time but now I&#x27;m getting used to it. Looks amazing with some sea salt spray!</li>
    <li> came in original box and works great&lt;br /&gt;only problems&lt;br /&gt;full heat gets handle kid of hot and plastic starts to wrinkle near the iron</li>
    <li> This is so awesome! It&#x27;s pretty easy to do - I have fine hair that is 3-4in below my shoulders and it takes about 10 or 15 minutes to wave my hair. It does look &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; at first but if you let it cool off and settle down, it turns into nice loose waves that last a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaints I have is that it does not have a stand or anything, so you can&#x27;t really put it down on the counter (I set the edge down on the sink porcelain) and the texture at the part where your thumb goes so you can grip it rubs my thumb and hurts.</li>
    <li> literally in love!! the waves stay in and it doesn&#x27;t take that long to do! easy and cute simple look</li>
    <li> It doe what it says. I got a perm awhile back and it changed my perm in the best way. It was always so frizzy but it really helped fix that bad spots.</li>
    <li> Creates beautiful waves.</li>
    <li> Terrible waste of money</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on my super straight hair.  Maybe it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough?  Neither I nor my daughter care for it.</li>
    <li> I love this waver. My hair is so thin and this helps me to look my hair a bit thicker.. I am so happy with my purchased. Didn&#x27;t regret it at all</li>
    <li> The Shipping Was Very Fast , Faster Then Expected Actually , It Is A Bit Bulky But Gets The Job Done.</li>
    <li> This Waver works for long hair well. It has high quality because I have been using it since 2011. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Was excited bc of all the good reviews. Horrible! All it did was make my hair frizzy</li>
    <li> Love this deep waver! I have long thick hair and while it did take a long time to do my hair with this, it turned out great and the curls held for over a day with no hairspray. Normally my hair won&#x27;t hold curls for more than 2-3 hours. The look that this deep waver gives is that sort of beachy/wavy hair. I would recommend getting hair clips along with this because it is much easier to do in sections.</li>
    <li> Very Awsome hair waver..I have a very long and silky hair. it worked whith me very well..And the waves last long...Loved So much. definetly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This waver is perfect! It gives my hair nice, beachy waves that almost look like they were made using a curling wand. On top of that, it only takes about 10 minutes to use on your whole head.</li>
    <li> Works really well ! I have very thick hair so if it worked on me I think it&#x27;ll work for anyone else :)</li>
    <li> This thing makes my long thick hair look ridiculous. The waves are not \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; at all. Looks like a jacked up perm afterwards. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> I got the bed head waver after my Conair waver cracked on me after the first use and I&#x27;ll tell ya I don&#x27;t like this waver nearly as much as the Conair one. This one does the job but it has no protection on the sides to keep you from burning the living crap out of yourself. Believe you me Ive done it more than once with this thing and OWWW!! Its kinda hard to get it closer to your roots so you have to start at like mid length on your and sometimes it looks funny. My daughter has super thick, really long beautiful hair and even using it on her hair it doesn&#x27;t look all that great. I use it usually on a daily basis now that Ive figured out how not to burn myself but I really gotta work with it to make it look good.</li>
    <li> Really deep waves. Still trying to perfect i never done anything with my hair exept flat iron it. Different trying something new But I like it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it a whole lot yet. But i like how it doesn&#x27;t take me long to style my hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a soft, natural curl, but it made my hair frizzy, crunchy, and extremely unnatural looking. I&#x27;m really disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
    <li> We ordered this for Christmas and my daughter loved it but in July, it quit working and wouldn&#x27;t get hot anymore.</li>
    <li> great and fast shipment and does my hair amazing a most have</li>
    <li> Has great heat and does a great job waving my hair.</li>
    <li> the first 2 time I tried this, It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I figured I was doing something wrong so I kept trying, about the 4th time I did it, it worked really good. the end results were good. I sprayed my hair with hairspray and went about my day, about an hr or 2 later, my hair started becoming flat and the waves started getting looser and looser. it didn&#x27;t last long for me. I figured it was my hair so I tired it on 3 of my friends hair and the same thing happened to them.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting this because it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> This waver is so wonderful! It gives a perfect mermaid-esque hairstyle &amp; I am in love with it! The waves are a great size &amp; it&#x27;s so quick and easy!</li>
    <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now &amp; couldn&#x27;t be happier with it minus the fact that it makes a burnt smell with your hair. I have found products to avoid the smell now, so its still a great product :)</li>
    <li> I have the Revlon 3 barrel which is also nice for tighter looking waves that look natural. For the record, I think the Revlon three barrel is faster to learn and use because you can crimp a larger area and visually see the peaks and hills. This one is also nice for a more formal party environment. It gives double the volume because the waves are bigger. I think the curls are a little bit tighter than a beachy wave look that people can get with a large curling barrel or bun curl. But this is more specific to the mermaid or Repunzel look. I highly recommend having some sort of wave crimper in your collection as it tends to quickly conceal and dress up a bad hair day if you want to wear your hair down. It also helps to conceal an uneven hair dye grow out, if you didn&#x27;t have time to refresh it. Though... As someone with long hair, I recommend only using it once in a while or consider no heat alternatives for everyday. Small damp bun curls at night do well for the beachy look and a heat barrel can be used for touch ups in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love this appliance. My only complaint is there is no shield on the top to keep you from burning your other hand, but I have gotten many, many compliments on my hair since I began styling it with this waver. And best of all, I can do my whole head in about 4 minutes! Highly recommend this waver.</li>
    <li> Omg I love this and I have thick ethnic hair. It really does give you deep waves and my hair stays the same shape and in place the way it was formed right when you pull it from the heat iron for 24hours even probably longer  when you don&#x27;t sleep on it. It takes me less time to use that then to flat iron because you can do different amounts of hair you use at once and run your fingers through to get beautiful waves. I don&#x27;t care what anyone says this is the best thing I bought on amazon and I love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fun to use! I like it, makes my hair look pretty. Nice product, a good buy. Would buy for a gift</li>
    <li> Works very well! Recommend it to anybody that is trying to get a cute hairstyle!</li>
    <li> I watched a lot of YouTube videos about this waver and had to buy! I was not disappointed either! I have very thick, unmanageable hair and the waves in my hair lasted the entire day without hairspray (just heat protectant) and even when I woke up in the morning the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people are saying their waves are too deep. Try a thicker piece of hair, brush it out a little, or even do it before bed and the waves will be looser when you wake up. Also, if you crimp the \\&quot;deep\\&quot; part of a wave you already made, it will be a tighter, smaller wave. There are a lot of different results depending on how you use the product, I suggest looking up videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also notice a lot of people complaining about dryness and frizzy hair. Use a better moisturizing shampoo and good heat protectant. Simple as that. If you want nice, healthy hair you need good products or just don&#x27;t use heat on your hair at all.</li>
    <li> this is the best thing i have ever used for my hair, i barely ever curl it or straighten it, but when i do do something to it, i use this. the waves stay in forever! i wash my hair if not everyday, every other day, and it stayed wavy till i washed it. if i could give it 6 stars i totally would!! i would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Pretty satisfied with this waver! Does a great job on hair :)</li>
    <li> Better than another similar brand I used. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> Makes amazing waves that last 2-3 days. Very natural looking and gives my thin, fine hair so much volume.</li>
    <li> Really great tool .waves last for days really hots up just has a bad smell. 0ther than that its great😀</li>
    <li> I like my Conair beach waver and thought this would work better because it&#x27;s not open at the bottom but it created a frizzy mess and the wave doesn&#x27;t allow for fullness closer to the root as it waves in instead of out.  I will try using it upside down to see what happens next time.  The look wasn&#x27;t as I expected and I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because the first I ordered melted.  There had to be a short in it or something because it melted the end covers off within 10 min and stopped working completely after.  The replacement they sent has been my favorite though and works great!  I have very thick long  hair and am able to do my entire head within 20 min.  It is actually faster than my babyliss straightener and I am constantly asked what I used on my hair when I use this.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described and creates gorgeous, full waves in minutes. Looks awesome on shorter hair. :)</li>
    <li> Great product, heats up nicely and curls well.</li>
    <li> I have super fine hair and I was quite surprised it did great !</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase! I also have a triple barrel iron.  I got this one because I wanted bigger, beachier waves.  This works perfect and is easier to use.  I have very thin, super straight hair.  Usually, my hair does not hold a curl at all.  With this, the waves last all day and night and even look good the next day.  It is very quick to do and makes my hair look so much thicker.  I did my sister&#x27;s the hair the other day and now she wants one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> First of all, be prepared for how large this gadget is!  Huge!  I read the reviews and saw mention that you couldn&#x27;t use this very well with short hair but wasn&#x27;t sure how \\&quot;short\\&quot; they meant.  Now I know.  My hair is a little below chin length and this gadget just won&#x27;t work.  Need to have hair that is below the shoulder.</li>
    <li> this works great I bought it for my granddaughter</li>
    <li> great product for a great price</li>
    <li> Bought it for my daughter.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> I love my wavy hair! I needed a different look and this is perfect. I have medium to long hair and the waves are beautiful. It is so easy to use too.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its super easy to use. I can get my hair nice just in 20 min.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would advise it everybody</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE hair product now. My roommate had one and I borrowed it once. Then every day for a week. it is super quick, even with my thick hair and looks awesome. I have SO MANY compliments from strangers when I use it!</li>
    <li> Cool concept but it just leaves my medium length hair looking very poodle like. I would only use this if you have long hair that is kind of a heavy texture to weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. My hair has a little bit of natural wave to it so this does wonders at enhancing it!</li>
    <li> This is a really fun product! The waves this creates can be really soft or really defined!! It all depends on what you like.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair really glossy and healthy looking! As a girl with stick straight, Asian hair, I can say it leaves the waves in all day! Even the next day it looks great!</li>
    <li> My hair does not hold a curl, but this works wonders.  My hair is thick, but it still only takes 5-10 minutes for me to do all of my hair and it will stay for days.  The best part is that my daughter lets me do her long, thick hair and she only takes 5 minutes as well!  Definitely my new favorite tool!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to... give you a great head of curls.</li>
    <li> As someone with fine, relatively straight hair, I&#x27;ve tried every technique imaginable to add texture (and volume!).  Curling irons always make ringlets that are a little too perfect, not the relaxed NATURAL curly look...so I ordered the Deep Waver. This thing is amazing! It was delivered to my house within 24 hours of ordering, and as soon as I received it I turned it on. I went from flat hair to wavy, big hair in a matter of 10 minutes. It might take some practice to create continuous waves, seeing as this was my first time using it, the top pieces came out somewhat kinky. But like any hair tool, it just needs some practice. My husband complimented me all night and was clearly impressed with how it came out. No more fake ringlets for this girl! For the price, this product is a great value.</li>
    <li> this didnt really deep wave my hair. when i braid my hair over night, the waves come out better looking than what this product does. i like that it gets really hot though. i wont really be using this.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is it makes great waves in no time. Easy to use! Lasts most of the day as well</li>
    <li> Item arrived quite fast and perfectly functioning, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I actually really satisfied of this purchase on Amazon, didn&#x27;t think it would be like so</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! My daughter&#x27;s hair couldn&#x27;t hold a curl for nothing! I used hot rollers, braided her hair before bed, etc. and within half an hour, her hair was flat. This thing actually kept her hair wavy until the next day! And it&#x27;s so easy to use. Her hair is halfway down her back and it only took me like 15 minutes to do it all. I would highly recommend it to anyone :)</li>
    <li> I love it, i love it, I LOVE IT! I get bouncy perfect waves everytime. I will be purchasing one for my best friend. Great product, fast shipping, I am so happy with this!</li>
    <li> I love this iron.  It&#x27;s basically crimper on super crack.  It gives you the most amazeballs hair ever.  I have really fine, long, wavy hair. This evens up my waves and gives me gorgeous, Hollywood worthy hair.  I was in awe at how fast you can do your whole head - less than 15 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat setting dial is hard to figure out. It needs a white dot or something so you know where you have the heat level set. It&#x27;s too easy to hit while you are using the iron. They need to move that. Otherwise, super genius product.</li>
    <li> I did this on my hair and it looks amazing. It looks like I have natural waves. It&#x27;s fast and easy.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this didn&#x27;t give me big waves in my hair.  It put little waves in my hair but not like the advertisement.  I have very long fine hair.</li>
    <li> This has revolutionized how I do my hair!  My hair is kinky and natural curly but only on the underneath layers.  It takes only a few minutes to crimp the top sections of my hair and I am ready to go!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I gave up getting my hair permed over 20 years ago, but every now and then I just want to rock that 80s look again. This thing is awesome and I wish I had been born with the waves it gives me.</li>
    <li> It works great if wavy, not curly, hair is all you need to have. It will not curl your hair. It worked on my hair, which is fine and straight. Can&#x27;t speak for other types of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my triple barrel curling iron died. The waves are bigger than with the triple barrel, but I like this just as well. And the best part is that even in the humid South where I live the waves still stay for days if I need them too! Makes looking decent with a newborn in my case much easier.</li>
    <li> I have a fine hair that usually falls pretty easily. This product quickly creates the effect I&#x27;m looking for. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Quick way to get wavy hair that looks great. This product heats up very quickly. My hair is kind of thick I used the heat half way up and my waves turned out great. I held for about 15 seconds per section.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works exactly how I expected it to.</li>
    <li> Great beach curls!! Bought this after seeing s YouTube video on beach waves for the hair and this it the hair iron you need for that look!</li>
    <li> My hair is hit or miss when it comes to holding curls, normally falling out by day&#x27;s end with spray. However, with this deep waver the waves stay without hairspray no problem. It doesn&#x27;t have any cool spots to hold the actual tool (including the plastic loop on the end) and it gets very hot so you need to be careful of that. I now have a nasty burn on my hand where it tapped the deep waver and it looks like its going to scar.</li>
    <li> The product would not turn on.  A complete waste of money. Hopefully seller will replace. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> not compatible with NZ plugs. cost for transformer $149.00 NZ</li>
    <li> I have straight and thick hair. For me this product makes waves kind of similar to when you leave braids in overnight. Only problem is a weirdly obvious kink at the top but I&#x27;ll just have to figure out how to use it better. For the price it is great.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Heats up fast and hot waives last for two days</li>
    <li> I love this waver! It gets hot enough but not so hot that it burns your hair. Easy to use! I would definetly recommend it to anyone looking for soft gentle waves.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t make my hair wavy and it burns my hair. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. its a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great for a great triple barrel look.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommand this waver, my grand daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality. Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a great gift for a young girl, this is a great gift.</li>
    <li> This really curls deeply. I didn&#x27;t do such a hot job with my hair, but it works nice on my girls. Was a bit too much curl on me. Curl holds nicely, too. Gets good and hot quickly!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I have it for more than a year already. Does the job well. No cons.</li>
    <li> I am fully satisfied with the purchase, the waver leaves my hair shiny and with those perfect californian curls. However, this product is made in the USA, so you will need an adaptor for your country to be able to plug it in the wall.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!! The wave comes out so pretty and perfect and very minimal time to do my whole head...Just love it! Very pretty beachy style waves so pretty just like other girls that have pictures they added in reviews!</li>
    <li> a present for my daughter and she said it was so easy to use.  the results were a fuller head of hair with lots of waves.</li>
    <li> It creates beautiful waves that really last. It only took about 15 mins to put pretty waves on my whole head! It&#x27;s light and your hand doesn&#x27;t get tired. I am very pleased and highly recommend! :)</li>
    <li> I think it has an excelent price and meets all of my expectations! There&#x27;s not one single item or function missing, nor anything else to make me deslike it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret buying.</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased one for herself and let me use it. I loved it so much I ordered one for myself. Like how it allows you to control the heat setting instead of just giving you one amount to use. Makes big waves that add body and last more than all day. Still see results the next day. If curling irons and rollers don&#x27;t work on your hair, throw them out and get this product.</li>
    <li> It was a Xmas gift for her and I have used it once.  It heats up quickly, styles as advertised, and is durable.  We have been very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> love this product, not as heavy as everyone described&lt;br /&gt;it gives natural waves and requires less than 15 minutes with your dry hair</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this waver! It&#x27;s amazing! It is easy to use, heats quickly, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, and gives your hair the perfect amount of wave! Definitely would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but this gives me a really cute look. It isnt curled and it isnt straight but def. a night out kind of look!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle tool for my flat hair!! I am also not very skilled at doing my hair. This waver is super easy to use compared to a curling iron or even a flat iron to make curls. I can also finish my hair faster than curling it. I have received so many compliments! My hair is thin and fine so it can get damaged easily.  I make sure to use a heat protecting spray and I do not clamp the waver on my hair longer than 10 seconds. The waver heats up very fast and while I appreciate the lock feature, I only need it when storing the tool. I know two people who have now purchased this waver after seeing how nice my hair comes out and they love it as well</li>
    <li> awesome but made my hair very frizzy. I used a heat protector as recommended but still looks frizzy.  Maybe it works better on dark hair. I have blonde long hair.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and I just wanted to add in one wave. This does nothing more than poof my out. I can get waves in the front but the rest just poofs out.</li>
    <li> as soon as i got i tried it on my hair it made beautiful wavy it even lasted till the next day great product</li>
    <li> Have never owned a waver before. So glad I bought one. My hair is straight and fine but with the waver I have so much volume. I&#x27;ve had several compliments when I wave my hair.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair feeling soft and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to monitor young girls using this item.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift for a friend or yourself.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work for hair like I thought it should</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It does exactly what it says, nice beachy waves and the handle is a pretty turquoise shade that puts me in a good mood :) However, the only downside is that it heats up too much too fast! I have normal hair and i have to be very careful not to leave it on for too long or it will burn and damage (i use heat protection spray ALWAYS). Also, be careful when handling this product and curling around the face area because it will burn! I tried different heat settings but it&#x27;s always the same issue. Oh, and make sure to keep this item away from anything plastic, it will burn and melt it.  Also, it is pretty big, but i like the \\&quot;lock\\&quot; feature because it allows for easy storage. I would not travel with it though, it&#x27;s too bulky. Good styling tool and quality for the price. I use it when i want to look a little glam or for a fun rock n roll shaggy style.</li>
    <li> This waver is amazing! It gives easy, beachy, sexy wavy hair. The waver heats up really quickly. I use the low setting and style my hair by alternating from the left side to the right side, sort of messily. It is so quick and easy and gives you Kate Hudson-esque waves. This is way better than those triple barrel curling irons or a crimper type waver. This is a great deal and much quicker to use than wrapping my hair around a 1\\&quot; curling iron, which is what I used to do to get beachy waves. I have long hair, past my shoulders, and it takes me about 15 minutes to do with this waver. Finish with some hair spray and rock it! I think this also works great when your hair is sort of dirty-it looks really textured and full.</li>
    <li> Great Product. I does exactly what my 12 yo daughter and I want it to do. Quick heat up, Great price, Just be careful not to get it too hot as you will burn your hair off!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  Uses the waver regularly and the results are fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy hair which has oddly changed over the years. When I was younger, I had ringlets but maybe because I&#x27;ve spent the last 5 or 6 years straightening it with a flat iron, now when I want to go curly, it&#x27;s sort of frizzy everywhere and in some places, not even curly at all. It&#x27;s very odd, but this item really helps. I dry my hair with a diffuser first and get as much of my natural curl going as I can. Then in the places causing me trouble, I use the waver and it helps my hair look uniformly curly everywhere. It is quite large as others have mentioned so storing it or traveling with it is kind of a pain, but once you get used to handling it, it&#x27;s easy to use. Careful with the temperature setting wheel, though. I often accidentally move it while using the waver and it gets too hot or cool. Kind of a weird place to put it. But it heats up and down quickly, creates natural looking waves with no frizz. Be warned also that this is a \\&quot;deep\\&quot; waver so the waves are very pronounced. If you release it quickly you can lessen the effect a bit. Overall I like it and would recommend this iron.</li>
    <li> This is the first waver I have ever purchased... and I&#x27;m sure glad I did! Heats up really fast and with a little hair spray the waves stay all day. The waves themselves are not too big and not too small, just perfect! I get compliments on my wavy hair all the time now :)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this deep waver, since I&#x27;ve never used one before. It heats up fast and it&#x27;s easy to use. It makes my hair look gorgeous. Just make sure you use a heat protectant before you use it. I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with how easy it is to use and how quickly it heats up.</li>
    <li> Got it 2 days before the expected day of delivery so two-thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really long and wavy / straight, but it&#x27;s not stick-straight. I wanted to try the boho-waves so I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls for too long, usually just 5 hours, but with this deep waver, my curls lasted overnight. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because a small part of my hair was a bit frizzy. Not sure if it was because of my hair or because of the deep waver.</li>
    <li> perfect! better than expected&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> So I Wanted a single barrel hair waver, this would be a good choice. I have one now that is huge and is really hard to do anything with because it&#x27;s a pain to Get hair lined up in it. I need something smaller that will give me the beachy look. Is this a good pick??</li>
    <li> Works well but it is hard to line up the grooves.  I need more practice.  Heats up quickly</li>
    <li> I would give this 5 stars but it actually melted inside the iron on the very first day!  It melted the blue paint directly beneath the metal curler as it was warming up.</li>
    <li> Recieved it 4 days earlier than expected.  Took me about 15 mins to get it opened, heat it up, and wave all of my shoulder length hair. It is now about 12 hours later and my hair still looks great. The waves look more natural as the hair relaxes, but are still pretty defined. I would definitely recommend using some sort of heat protectant so that it doesn&#x27;t come out looking fuzzy instead of wavy, and make sure to keep it on the hair long enough. 6-8 seconds is not long enough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it , I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome little tool. If you want more natural looking waves, this is the way to go. It can be a little time consuming but overall its great.</li>
    <li> amazing buy, it works as expected! will buy from here again !!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give the wave it shows in the photo. It&#x27;s decent but I&#x27;m disappointed that the wave looks cheap!</li>
    <li> I do like it but gives a slight 80&#x27;s look curl. I wish the curls were less uniform and more random.</li>
    <li> I called every single store I could think of that would carry this product and they simply did not have it. If you are looking to purchase a product that will give you waves like LANA Del Rey I suggest you purchase this!</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this producted. Makes my hair wavey. Just since i have Asian straight it takes a bit of time.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this waver with some reviews I read but I&#x27;ve used it once and I already love it! It makes perfect deep waves exactly as it says and I haven&#x27;t burnt myself with it so if you&#x27;ve had problems with it then you can&#x27;t blame this waver! I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on my hair with just the one use so far and my hair stays overnights :) and it doesn&#x27;t frizz out or get dry at all which says a lot since I have thick afro hair thanks to my dad&#x27;s side of the family! Overall I am extremely happy with this waver, would buy again and recommend to everyone :)</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair. So whenever I see something like this, I always doubt it will do anything to my hair. Well, it works amazing. It takes a little while because my hair is so thick, but the outcome is totally worth it. I love it!</li>
    <li> My hair looks beautiful with waves</li>
    <li> This deep waver really works. Unfortunately, my iron lotion does not work with this product and my hair smells and feels dry after using this. If anyone knows of any products to help keep hair from drying out while using this product, please let me know. My iron lotion works with other heat appliances, but my hair needs something special for this one. I even turn down the heat! LOL &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> When I bought this iron I was anticipating more of a vintage wave feel. That is not what I got. I feel like I could have gotten the same effect from my hair just from braiding it in sections. It does not seem the smooth the cuticle at all either so for someone like me with naturally frizzy and puffy hair this does not create a flattering look AT ALL. This was a complete and utter waste of money for me. It may come in handy if I decide I want to be a crazy cat lady for Halloween.</li>
    <li> wish heat styling wasn&#x27;t so bad for our hair or I&#x27;d use these with 2nd day hair all the time!</li>
    <li> Ordered this bc my hair dresser used it on my hair. I have long thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to keep waves in. This is wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair looked crimped (like the 80&#x27;s) but has a pretty wave to it. Shipped extremely fast and one of my favorite hair weapons in my arsenal!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great quality although I haven&#x27;t tried it, I have a lo of hair and long to I&#x27;m debating what day to use it.</li>
    <li> does take a lot of patience and your hand gets tired because it&#x27;s time consuming, but the end result is worth it. The waves are beautiful and last a long time.</li>
    <li> Hello Everybody!&lt;br /&gt;For starters: I have thick, curly, layered  hair that reaches past my shoulders. I bought this product to define my curls.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing! It makes beautiful deep waves in my hair similar to those of Sailor Neptune. Just look up on youtube how to use it. In addition you can slide it through your hair like a flat iron to straighten it. I used that method and I was able to straighten my hair in less than an hour! Wonderful product, Bed Head.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I have a weird hair texture and my hair does not look well when I use a curling iron.  It looks great when I do this and it lasts all day.  I took it on a 2 week cruise so that if it was humid, I would not have to use a straightener only to have it curl up again.  It worked wonderfully!  The only drawback is that I have to be very careful not to burn my fingers or head as the design is a bit odd.  But with practice, it is all good.</li>
    <li> Much better than I expected! I was thinking of getting a permanent body wave to add volume to my flat, fine hair but I think I won&#x27;t need to resort to that.</li>
    <li> I love this deep waver! It makes my hair look like I just left the salon with a body wave... without paying hundreds of dollars and damaging my hair!!  My boss liked it so much she is even ordering one!!</li>
    <li> Mine only worked one time and that was only to test if it turned on, i never did my hair with it,then tryed to do my hair the next day anf it stoped working, it wasnt heating it just turned the light on !!!sucks !!</li>
    <li> great shine, heats up fast and locks when its on the hair 5 stars was considering perming my hair but this works great and gives me flexibility in styles</li>
    <li> Perfect waves!!!!i love this bed head waver...</li>
    <li> I love this iron...I have really fine, limp, thin hair that never holds a wave or a curl. This was exactly what I needed to give my hair some volume. It&#x27;s a good price considering the results you get. This works better than a triple barrel because you clamp down the hair, and your strands are covered in heat on all sides so the wave holds longer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, doesn&#x27;t even work and my hair is very easy to curl. The only good thing was that shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I had a friend that had one of these. I used it before and it worked amazing. With this waving iron I would have to go over even the smallest strands of hair multiple times to get it to stay. I don&#x27;t know if it is just my hair type but using this product did not go well with me.</li>
    <li> i gave myself time to use this product before i reviewed it...i have a smaller wave iron that i like, but this one is my favorite. i can wave my whole head in 10 minutes or less. i find it doesn&#x27;t work as well if i pull my hair into smaller sections. i have fine, straight hair and it works best if i put big chunks of hair in there to wave. the next day all i have to do is touch it up a little. i can do this for at least 3 days before i need to wash my hair again. if you have thinner hair and it looks stringy when you straighten it, this is for you.....it makes your hair look thick and full. i love, love, love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It heats up quickly, has the heat dial, and works great. I did my research before i bought a waverhard and everyoneyou was saying they liked this one and i completely agree. I love it :-)</li>
    <li> I watched a styling video on youtube before using this for the first time, It works well I&#x27;ve had a little trouble with my shortest layers but they&#x27;re only about 2 inches long, so thats to be expected. The waves come out looking pretty natural, they last pretty much all day, I wash my hair daily so I wouldn&#x27;t know if they would survive for days, I&#x27;m also a rough sleeper so my hair gets pretty crazy overnight. Overall satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not purchased from Amazon, but this tool is downright amazing! I received it last year when my hair was long and it made the nicest waves. I liked them a little messier so I tousled my hair a bit and that was absolutely my favorite way to wear my hair. Since I&#x27;ve cut my hair short (bit above my chin) I haven&#x27;t used it for free the waves would look silly on short hair but I tried it out yesterday and it still looked amazing! I&#x27;ll admit it was a little harder to get the short hair on the back of my head but I made it out unscathed. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for nice waves or beachy waves. So glad I discovered it works beautifully on my short hair too!</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in this waver. I read every single review &amp; could not wait for it to come into the mail. I used it the day I got it &amp; could not believe the results. My hair is naturally straight &amp; curls really well. This deep waver made me look like I stuck my finger into an electrical socket. I ended up returning the deep waver &amp; I&#x27;m still on the look out for a deep waver that works.</li>
    <li> This thing is clever, but I don&#x27;t think it works with shorter hair. After using it, I looked like I was struck by lightning. Seriously. Hair was sticking straight up.&lt;br /&gt;If you have long (LONG) hair, perhaps give it a try. Anything above your collar bone, keep scrolling and find something else.</li>
    <li> Its not what I thought it would be. I was very excited to try it and I wasnt very happy with the way it worked</li>
    <li> It love this, it makes such easy curles. I can do my entire head in 5 min. It is best to spray the hair with hair spray just before each uses.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both bought this waver and love it! Very easy to use, my hair held the waves for three days at least. Wouldn&#x27;t spend the extra money on a pricier waver as this one does the job very well. Take the extra cash and go out to dinner with your new do!</li>
    <li> Awesome! fast and easy to use, no more ugly ends. Makes hair look wavy, not actual curls, unless they work if you leave it for longer and with higher heat.</li>
    <li> So I have mid back, thick, curly/ wavy hair that pretty much does whatever it feels like doing.  I get half straight areas around my face, limp spots, wound tight spots . . . you name it.  I bought the generic one of these (exactly the same just not teal in color?) but I think I dropped it and the one side became VERY wiggly and couldn’t grasp anymore so ordered this one (a few $ more).  I LOVE IT!  It takes me 5 – 10 minutes to get my curls in line how I want them and THEY STAY!!  Yes – you need a product, hairspray, gel, whatever to help but NOWHERE near as much as I used trying to just get curls to do as I commanded!  I am becoming an avid Bed Head product user now – Tigi After Party, Ego Boost and their Shampoo/conditioner.  Great stuff &amp; thanks so much for the availability on AMAZON!  Try it – it is a wonderful and SIMPLE styling tool!</li>
    <li> This gives my hair the perfect beach wave and it holds all day.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous lightweight three barrel curling iron. It gave me beautiful waves, somewhat tight, not as loose as I had hoped but still great. It was fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heated up within five minutes. This has a slider to allow you to choose the heat level, from low to high. I used the low heat and got beautiful if somewhat small waves without having to leave this in my hair for more than five seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this is, and it is probably a result of the climate here in south Florida, that the curls were gone in five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had hoped the waves would be looser, bigger, rather than more of a rippled effect.&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally wavy hair and the waves from this were actually tighter than my natural waves. It creates a somewhat ethnic type wave. It looked amazing in my hair for the five minutes it lasted. My hair felt a bit dried out after I used this. It would be an excellent idea to use a heat protective product with this. I wouldn&#x27;t use this again&lt;br /&gt;without some sort of protective lotion on my hair first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure if you live in a climate with lower relative humidity than we have here you would be pleased with this. It&#x27;s very fast easy and fun to use and gives beautiful results.</li>
    <li> When I used it the first time everyone liked my hair&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually lasted for 3 days without getting ruined or become straight again&lt;br /&gt;my friends asked me to bring them one&lt;br /&gt;so I just ordered 15 of this amazing product&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t hesitate&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s cheap and perfect even for straight straight hair</li>
    <li> This is a really good waver that gives you mermaid waves. The only problem is that it does burn your hair overtime. It should have ceramic.</li>
    <li> Takes awhile to do my hair, but this makes it so full of body! It turns out so beautiful! A little bit frizzy, but I look like I have natural curly hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this, after cutting my hair in a chin length bob, for a 1920s themed Halloween party. It made perfect finger waves for this! Loved it so much I use it just because. My husband teases me that I look like a character from Downton Abbey (though I don&#x27;t use styling cream like Mary and Edith, so I guess I&#x27;m more of a poor Irish Sybil, lol). It heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t take long to do a full head of short hair (though it does help to have someone do the back for you...I usually use a mirror and do my best with it). Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and this tool works wonders. It leaves nice big waves that last all day. I think it is important to not use the highest setting and not leave the iron on each section so long, otherwise the waves become to defined for what i am looking for. Makes my hair look thick and received a ton of compliments. Its my new little secret!</li>
    <li> loved it, worked better than I thought it would deff. gives me a different style with my hair I love it</li>
    <li> I love this hair waver!!!! I have super thick curly Latin hair, and this waver smooths my hair and puts nice waves in it. I was pretty hesitant in trying a waver, but i love it.  The product is very good quality. Theres a switch to keep it locked shut, u can adjust the heat from high to low. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair who has thin and straight hair, it works just the same for her hair type!!Its sooo worth the money!! Item was shipped very quickly, arrived at my house a day early! I highly recommend the product and the seller!</li>
    <li> iv never been good at fixing my own hair, this AMAZING tool allows me to have cute stylish hair in just a few minutes. its the greatest hair tool i own i will be buy another one so i can give my best friend the best gift ever!!!! :)</li>
    <li> This deep waver is amazing! It is bargain priced and works excellent. I have curly/wavy hair and this is what I do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Wash and condition hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Put anti-frizz serum on the lower 2/3 of my hair. I didn&#x27;t use hairspray, because it can make my hair dry and frizzy. It probably depends on your own hair texture though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Smooth ends with a straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Use the waver (the video shows how).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Gently comb out with a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waves literally last for days! I am so impressed!</li>
    <li> The one I have is designed exactly like this except its black and not by bed head.it IS a Vidal sassoon tourmaline ceramic so its the same thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan. One day the lock position decided to stop working, now it doesn&#x27;t close at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron is too big and bulky.not a graceful styler at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;doesn&#x27;t leave frizz\\&quot;?coulda fooled me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature control could have been made a lot better.I&#x27;d like to know exactly what temp i&#x27;m using, not some dialing scroll going from high to low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length and I think this is better used for someone with very long hair. The plates are designed in a way that takes a lot of hair to go into the grooves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it anymore and i&#x27;m tossing it</li>
    <li> I have just-above-shoulder-length hair.  Skimming-shoulder-length hair, perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this waver to try and give myself wavy hair... but because of the way the waver head is situated it sort of looks like I got electrocuted.  I will be the first to admit that I am not the most skilled with hair, but it was difficult to see what I was doing while using it (which resulted in the surprising look).  I will keep practicing, but if you have short hair you may want to consider another product.</li>
    <li> This was the best thing I ever bought. I got so many compliments for my hair. And for those people that said it doesn&#x27;t make your hair look beachy well u must have used it wrong watch a YouTube video on how to use it and your hair will be amazing.</li>
    <li> love love love it !!!! Even awesome for short hair! If you have been looking for something to make that beautiful wave....look no further! You won&#x27;t regret it and the price is unbeatable! I am a hairdresser and I did question how good it was going to be because it wasn&#x27;t expensive! But it works amazing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was something different than what I usually use. I also have the hot tools waver. But I guess this one was easier to use and heat faster. Curls are amazing but it is a little too heavy too big.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight hair that never likes to hold curls. This waver, however, works great on my hair and the waves last a long time. I just wish there were more settings rather than high and low.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!!!!! So happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> Makes really cute waves. A tad large and klunky but I like it.</li>
    <li> great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I really liked these irons. They do what you&#x27;d expect, and that&#x27;s create a lot of waves in a short amount of time. I am NOT particularly fond of the heating dial, but it&#x27;s not so bad that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these. For the price, and for what most people want, I think these are pretty good irons. I actually don&#x27;t have any real reasons as to why one shouldn&#x27;t purchase these. Buy them, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Pros -&lt;br /&gt;It gets hot and stays hot fast.&lt;br /&gt;It creates waves.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I can set it down without it burning anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bulky.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted curly waves. I got &amp;#34;flapper girl&amp;#34; waves.&lt;br /&gt;Price (I could have gotten it cheaper at Wal*Mart or Fred Meyer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - if you want flapper girl hair this will do the trick. If you want curly waves this won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Love it, very easy to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic &amp; usually don&#x27;t find things like this that actually work for me....I was happily surprised by this....I have fine hair which doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily...this is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t catch on my hair, kinda fun, and just gives me one more styling option....my hair goes about 2 inches below my shoulder....this would look great on people with long hair....if your hair is short, don&#x27;t buy it, you need at least about 5 inches of length to use it well</li>
    <li> My hair stylist raved about this item and wrote the name of it down on a card and suggested I buy it. I have fine hair and always struggle to get body. She said another of her clients is in the same boat and highly recommends this deep waver. I watched the tutorials and was so impressed with the results. I could not wait to try it myself. UGH!!! I get nothing. My hair does not do anything. I get zero waves. I turned the appliance to high, hoping that would make a difference. It didn&#x27;t. I just don&#x27;t get why this won&#x27;t work. The girls in the tutorials get these amazing, gorgeous waves and my hair does absolutely nothing. I&#x27;m so very disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. Apparently, I&#x27;m destined to have crap hair.</li>
    <li> Works great. Love it! Makes wonderful stylish waves. It is definitely not like the old 80s style crimpers at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair tool ever</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this curling iron. She has short hair that she sometimes flat irons and sometimes wants to wear it wavy.  It took her one day to get the hang of using it.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> It works just like the reviews said.</li>
    <li> I want to love this so badly.  My hair is fine, thick, slick straight, and naturally oily and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for anything.  With this waver, my hair looks great for about ten minutes and then it starts to fall already...basically as soon as it cools off.  I have to keep it in the waver extra time to keep any sort of limp wave by the days end but the extra heat exposure isn&#x27;t exactly healthy.  I&#x27;m going to keep experimenting with different in-hair products to try and achieve a longer hold because I do think this waver works, it&#x27;s just my hair type is an uncooperative PITA to do anything with.</li>
    <li> I love the natural wave it gives me.  It would get 5 stars if it automatically turned off.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! The only downfall, in my opinion, is I can&#x27;t hold the other end to guide it or stabilize it. (Especially when trying to style the hair in the back) Otherwise I have been very pleased with how this product styles my hair.</li>
    <li> Just got this today and had to check it out! I am completely handicapped when it comes to curling my hair, but this deep waver is amazing!! I  love it! Can&#x27;t wait to try out different techniques!</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair like me, I don&#x27;t think this will work very well. The heat doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair and I&#x27;m left with bad to ok waves.</li>
    <li> It takes a little bit of practice to get it to look right, but once you get it down, it looks really cute!</li>
    <li> I am still getting the hang of how to use it and hold it correctly in order to get the perfect shape but once I do, it looks amazing!</li>
    <li> Satisfied with this product and the price.</li>
    <li> came super fast and works great on my hair</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and this deep waver did the miracle. Plus, the curls lasted for few days. I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
    <li> Thumbs Up! I have yet to try it at its highest but so far, its good. The curl&#x27;s last :)</li>
    <li> I was REALLY excited to try the Wave Artist. I watched various youtube videos, and I read a lot of reviews. I have to say though, I was disappointed after trying it. The waver works, but it&#x27;s not what I thought it was going to be.     My hair is thick so I put smoothing gel in it before hand and used my straightening iron (quickly) to try and tame it before I used the Wave Artist. I thought maybe having semi-straight hair would make my hair look better (I first tried the waver on my natural wavy hair yesterday, and it was an epic fail lol). After using the Wave Artist on my \\&quot;straighter\\&quot; hair, it still puffed out and kind of made my hair look like a poof-ball. I was hoping the waver would kind of control my hair and make it thinner, but I was wrong. It never really tamed my hair at all.    Plus, you have to hold the waver on for a long time if you want semi-decent waves. I knew that going in, but I really didn&#x27;t understand it until I had to do it.     It&#x27;s a little bulky, but not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Just be careful not to burn yourself; I could see how someone easily could.    Most likely I will be returning the Wave Artist. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting, but I know I didn&#x27;t get it from this.    If you&#x27;re still unsure as to get it, I&#x27;ll say this: I would only get it if you know you can return it.</li>
    <li> I love what this product did to my hair. I have thick curly hair, so i could never get the wavy look that i love. I have gotten to many compliments when i used this product. Thanks bed head</li>
    <li> I love this crimper! The waves actually last a couple of days, doesnt take too long to heat up either</li>
    <li> It was good while it lasted but only used the thing 4-5 times before it went totally kaput - i.e., it will not longer heat up and is therefore useless.</li>
    <li> Heats up real fast and creates great waves! It heats up really fast so make sure you use heat protective spray.</li>
    <li> I love the look that this product gives. It is very easy to use and the outcome is always great! Very deep, defined waves. So pretty!</li>
    <li> The results form this product are good but the construction could be a bit better.  Still it deserves 4 stars because for the price it does exactly what it is suppose to do.  I am able to wave my hair in around 15 - 20 minutes where without this it would literally take me an hour.  If you are looking for something that is going to last for a long time, then maybe you are better off buying one that is higher quality.  I only use this thing a couple times per month, so again for the price its a really good value.</li>
    <li> I have tried every curling iron, roller what-have-you ... and this has finally given me the look I was aiming for.  Its super easy too!</li>
    <li> Deserves the 5 stars. I&#x27;ve had this product for 8 months now and it does wonders. I love this waver and i loved the price hehe. Recommend this to anyone looking for a good and affordable waver.</li>
    <li> I just got this on Friday. I did the two day shipping and was so super excited when it came. I used it right away. it heated up quickly. It really is not as heavy as it looks. I just did my hair again for the second time since I&#x27;ve gotten it. My hair is super thick but this amazing style tool held my hair for 2 and a half full days. It doesn&#x27;t take that long to style either. Plus the blue handle is eye catching. I love this and definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. It was very reasonable price and the end result is beautiful. Had my whole head done in nearly 5 mins. Curling iron is now obsolete.</li>
    <li> This product is SO easy to use! It heats up quickly and I was able to wave my hair in no time. My hair is bone straight and it doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well. However, this product is fast, easy and the curls stay for days!</li>
    <li> I bought this waver for my nieces Birthday that is coming up so it is still in the package.  It looks really nice and was a great price!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent waver. Saw alot of people raving about it in reviews and on YouTube. Usually these things don&#x27;t live up to the hype, but this one does. My hair doesn&#x27;t look exactly as nice and the girls in the YouTube tutorials, but my hair is also alot shorter and layered (just below shoulder length, VERY thin, layered). Despite not having the long hair to create &amp;#34;beachy mermaid&amp;#34; hair, this allows me to create funky S-waves that gives my normally flat hair LOTS of body. It only takes me about 5-10 mins tops to do my hair with this. I just blowdry it as straight as I can, clip up the top sections and start waving from the bottom layer and work my way up. It says to use 1&amp;#34; sections for best results and hold for 5-10 seconds, but I find for my hair and desired look, I take much bigger sections, use it on medium heat (higher heat if you have thick hair, mine is super thin), and hold for 3 seconds and release. It&#x27;s a trial and error process to find what will work best for your hair type. I love that I don&#x27;t have to be particulary careful about lining everything up perfectly because I like the more messy, funky wave look. The result is fun and feminine and i&#x27;ve gotten alot of compliments on how cute it looks and I usually don&#x27;t get any comments whatsoever. Great price and I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight, thin-ish hair, but it is really really long. Whenever I curl my hair, it lasts for around six hours, but no longer. I bought this hoping I could finally get my hair to be anything but straight. I used it today and it was really easy to use, and I really like what it does to my hair! I would definitely recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took me approximately twenty minutes to do my whole head. It looks great!</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful product but it broke a few months into it. I loved it, it did everything it was supposed to do and looked fabulous, but I have yet to find it Amazon will allow me to send it back and get a new one. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a hair waver for a long time and when I got this one, I was very disappointed. I have used other hair wavers before so I know my hair can be waved, but this one didn&#x27;t want to. I kept trying and trying but it didn&#x27;t make a dent in my hair! I am shocked cause my hair is fine and easily straightened with a flat iron. I ended up returning it and getting a hot tools one.</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair, this may not be a great product for you. It creates very small waves that resemble crimping more than large waves.</li>
    <li> love this product just wish my hair was not too thick for this deep waver ... would work better for thin hair types</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; looks natural! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I live in jersey . Not a thing to dislike about this product . Very affordable . Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future ! 😍💳</li>
    <li> I like the look. It takes FOREVER to do a whole head of hair. But I have 2 girls with straight hair that holds any curl for 30 minutes or less. This lasted all day, and gave volume and changed their looks completely.  Lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this was great!  It was so quick and easy and make nice beachy waves.  I was nervous it would make sharp crimps but it did not and I love it.</li>
    <li> great product, it was delivered about a week later and gives me the perfect waves.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s not perfect and it&#x27;s hard to look good at the roots, but it gets the job done. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product was pretty good! I liked it, I just didn&#x27;t like that it gave me hair an almost braided look, but once I shook my hair around and added hairspray I liked the look. You&#x27;ll just have to work with your hair a little. I guess because my hair is very think, but it works better on your hair when you put more hair in it. I noticed when I put smaller chunks it didn&#x27;t quite wave as much when I put larger chunks in. I&#x27;m pleased with this product though! It&#x27;s worth it for the price!</li>
    <li> Love! I have hair a bit longer than my shoulders, and this makes it look amazing! But some advice: the first time I used it, I sectioned off my hair in horizontal layered rows, and used the tool on each layer left to right, nape of neck, all the way up. By the end of the day it had puffed up a bit and I looked like a disco queen with a ton of hair! How I use it now is to section off hair and only use the tool on vertical sections, grabbing all the hair in that section top to bottom and using the tool on all layers at one, if that makes sense. I do not crimp in horizontal layers. Works great that way!</li>
    <li> works really well. i have thick hair past my bra line and i can style my whole head in less than 10 min.</li>
    <li> Super cool! Worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!! Looks like beach waves in the hair.  This is my second one to own. First one lasted me 3 years</li>
    <li> This is worthless unless you want your hair fried!</li>
    <li> I really like this waver. I&#x27;ve never really owned one before but I think it works really well for what its meant to do. I have awful hair and it does the trick, what else can I say?</li>
    <li> My girls have long straight hair and they are always looking for new ways to style their hair.  This has worked like a champ.</li>
    <li> got for granddaughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> Love this it works really well!! :)</li>
    <li> I liked this waver because it gets very hot and leaves your hair with waives all day. I barely have to use any hairspray after I use the waver.</li>
    <li> very nice product, perfect conditions</li>
    <li> I bought one for me and one for my friend.&lt;br /&gt;We have different type of hair, but both of us loved the product.&lt;br /&gt;It gave us natural waves and was easy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Waver is great! I timed how long it takes me- 12 minutes... Couple hints for users. If you are picky about the way your ends look, first curl your hair under quick with a curling iron. That way it all ends up smoothed under. No need to section your hair for that step. Second when you use the wave iron, separate your hair into sections. 3 sections horizontally- 3 sections across. I have pretty long hair and need to do it this way. Like, on bottom section, you will have a left, back and right section. (While other hair is piled up on head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that there was a huge shipping issue with the company, but the product itself is great.</li>
    <li> It does make beautiful waves if you practice enough. Also need to use heat protector since the tool gets pretty hot and may burn hair, be careful!</li>
    <li> Best thing I ever bought on here! i love this waver. It&#x27;s funny looking but it makes your hair so pretty.</li>
    <li> it burns your hair, the iron is very hot even in the lowest setting. but it does give you beachy waves</li>
    <li> I am in love. Seriously. This thing rocks, I have a crimper that is probably older than I am lol, and going to beauty school for a short time, I have lots of other hair tools and such so I ordered this just for fun and immediately opened it and put it to use once I received it, and I absolutely love it !!! So does my husband ;) It&#x27;s kind of like my crimper except sexier, stronger waves. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Awesome,I use it every day,good big waves. I can have waves in no time with the deep waver I love it.</li>
    <li> Maybe wouldn&#x27;t be bad if you had someone else to do your hair for you.  Too difficult to get the waves even and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have found to get that beach wave look. It is very easy to use, a little time consuming the first few times using it but it gets easier and faster each time, althought it is not hard to use. It gets very hot and you can control the temp. It is easy to hold and work. I am not very patient when it comes to getting ready but this is worth the little bit of extra time. I got 2 days worth of beautiful hair with this product. I got a lot of compliments when I used it and people thought that I went and had my hair done somewhere. Very happy with it. I have recommended it to many people and they have loved it also!</li>
    <li> It makes really cute curls, but it damages your hair. I really liked it at first but i have really long hair and it takes forever to get my hair done with this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this waver! I have been searching for an appliance that really made my hair look like it had natural, beachy waves and this is definitely it. I was even able to use it! I had to part my hair into 4 section but this only took me 40 minutes to finish and the look lasted for 2 straight days. Very impressed!</li>
    <li> It really does work so well and i get compliments on my curls and it does them so nicely! But it damages my hair like CRAZY no matter how much product I spray or put in my hair to protect it. Very very damaging. So I won&#x27;t use it often at all. So I guess it&#x27;s worth it but if you buy it, it&#x27;s probably safest to use it like... once a month lmao. blehgr.</li>
    <li> im very happy with this waver. it heats up fast with multiple heat settings and has good heat recovery. im a hairstylist and got this at a better price on amazon than i could through our supplier. im very pleased.</li>
    <li> This waver is really good if you want a little variety in your hair. I has an on/off setting, and you can modify it from low to hot. It heats up pretty quickly. Pretty easy to use, you just take a strand and work from the top. It takes a little patience, and also be careful not to get it to close to your skin. Its a good waver and the price is pretty okay. Like I said it does make big waves so keep that in mind. If you want smaller waves try the other bed head waver I think its for smaller waves. But if you&#x27;re looking for a waver this is definitely a good one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the product and i have to say it came  in 2 days i will hardly recomended love the color &amp; my hair looks healthy and shiny. :)</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  I have shoulder length, thick, hair.  I could not get any type of wave with this.  My hair looked like dried straw after using this iron.</li>
    <li> I have naturally straight hair that I usually have a hard time curling with typical curling irons. This little device makes my hair just how I&#x27;ve always wanted it!! Very quick and easy to use, give my hair a nice beach wave look. The only downfalls are that the entire outside of the barrel gets hot so that be kind of dangerous. Also, if you clamp it too close to your scalp it can give you a little bit of a crimp look, so I usually have to use a straightener at my root to fix it afterwards. Other than that, I love it. It gives my hair a nice looking wave that holds all day long.</li>
    <li> I use this just about everyday for a quick easy look that I get tons of compliments on.  It is really easy to use and the waves last all day.</li>
    <li> this is awesome....i use it on short hair and long hair and it makes it look like natural loose wavy hair.....its great for summer ....if you want a change from straight flat hair....it gives it body and flow....very easy to use also.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have fine straight hair,that doesn&#x27;t like to curl so finding&lt;br /&gt;Something that is easy to use, quick, and effective means alot to me,&lt;br /&gt;For the last 3-4 years I have been perming my hair, it had seemed liked&lt;br /&gt;The best solution. However the perm has damaged my hair to where&lt;br /&gt;I need to stop. I bought this for graduation since my perm has grown out.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this work great but the wave it gives is the same kind my perm was.&lt;br /&gt;It gives the look of a perm without the chemical damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is so much more I could say about how wonderful this is, like&lt;br /&gt;How the wave will stay in my hair for awhile without gel or hairspray,&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and fast, long lasting, simple, etc. But the biggest thing fir&lt;br /&gt;Me is that it gives me the look of my perm without the damage.</li>
    <li> i prefer the heavie one i used to have by revlon for 20 its on here i bealive and its bigger, maybe it was my lame haircut ihad hahaha</li>
    <li> It does as advertised and does it well. It doesn&#x27;t have an end piece that you can hold like a curling iron, so it does tire your arms out if you have a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;It gets very hot so it crimps fast. Makes large waves. I recommend doing small patches so it gives an overall curly effect. I would buy thus again. It&#x27;s great, and a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this deep waver to replace one that had finally died. It is a fantastic waver for the money. It heats up quickly, but does have a slight smell when you use it the first couple of times. My hair stays for several days after using this iron, longer than I did with my previous waver. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Quick, Easy to use!  Great Quality!&lt;br /&gt;Heats up pretty fast. I love the gentle waves!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> Love this!! Came in the mail really fast! I tried it out right away, it&#x27;s super easy to use! It&#x27;s a little time consuming if anything, I have thick hair so it took me about 40 minutes to do. I set it to the hottest since my hair is pretty thick but I don&#x27;t even think I had to. Really great product, so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously purchased another waver and was highly disappointed that the &amp;#34;waves&amp;#34; came out as &amp;#34;crimps&amp;#34;. This isn&#x27;t the 80s. Anyway, I ordered this one with higher hopes and it totally delivered! I am so impressed with it, that I have to resist using it everyday because it gives my normally flat hair so much volume. My hair normally doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for over an hour. I&#x27;ll do my hair with the Deep Waver in the morning and it will last all day! I can even go to bed and wake up with it still looking good! It also makes my hair shiny. I recommend this product to anyone! My only complaint would be that it needs a &amp;#34;kickstand&amp;#34; to support the hot surface when you lay it down.</li>
    <li> It gets really hot and it&#x27;s easy to use. Gorgeous waves!!</li>
    <li> Best iron ever.. lol definitely will recommend</li>
    <li> The best hair tool I have ever bought ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️&lt;br /&gt;My waves stayed for 3 days 😊</li>
    <li> I absolutely could NOT wait for this to come! It came today and let me tell you how wonderful it is. First, the shipping was amazing and right on time. Now, I have naturally curly hair, and I mean REALLY curly. I usually straighten it...I recently went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty about 2 months ago and bought some amazing clip in Remy extensions. Although very beautiful when straight, I have been curling them with a one inch curling iron and it does take a while....(also very beautiful) however, with this Bed Head Deep Waver, I simply put it on medium heat ( let me add here that the dial goes from low to high and you kinda have to judge where medium is) not so bad, but the WAVES ARE GORGEOUS and so simple! I did my hair as I usually do, blow dry after washing but skipped the straightening part ( was hesitant) but it turned out beautiful :) Also it really helps my shorter hair blend almost 100% with my longer extensions. I am a happy girl. This is not bulky and heats quickly. I just can&#x27;t say enough positive things.</li>
    <li> My new favorite way to wear my hair.  I have had triple barrels before....this is WAY better.  I have thick curly hair as it is and this had no problem giving me the beach wave I wanted.  I like the lock on it also.  Heats as hot as I need it to and fast.  Quick, nice way to fix your hair.</li>
    <li> Great addition to any girls hair tools! I have really long straight hair and this gives my really pretty even waves throughout. I can finish my whole head in like 20 minutes. Doesnt really look too natural because waves are so even, but I really like the waver.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  She loves it!  She says the waves stay in her fine hair all day.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her Deep Waver. She starts school really early and is always on the lookout for quick hair styles. The Deep Waver makes great, flowing curves in minutes.</li>
    <li> I only used it once but the waves looks more like crimps style than curling iron waves.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell you how many people loved my hair. As soon as I did my hair my little sister took it from me and did her hair. I can only imagine using this often, making it a daily hairstyle because its so easy to do and takes no time. It makes my hair feel soft and shine. I have very thin hair and suddently my hair looks like it has amazing volume. My BF thought I had extensions in my hair.</li>
    <li> love it. works great. love love love...</li>
    <li> I love it! I was thinking about getting a perm again but I found this and I decided to put the perm on hold. It stunk at first but it goes away. It looks nice the first day and second! Cheap too! I LOVE bed head products! Buy this! Also you would definitely want heat protection spray makes it look a lot better and plus doesn&#x27;t fry your hair!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has long hair.  My hair goes past the middle of my back and this is exactly what I needed!  Great price and the Waver did everything it stated in description.  My waves lasted all day which has never happened with regular iron or curlers.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and received it in the mail last week. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out so I used it that night. It worked beautifully, my hair looked amazing. I put it away and took it back out last night to use it. But it stopped working! The power light turns on, but it doesn&#x27;t get hot, at all! I even tried plugging it in a different outlet just in case...nope, no results. I was extremely disappointed. Now it looks like I&#x27;ll be ordering the Pro Beauty Tools one. Hopefully the extra $2 means it won&#x27;t break within the first week!</li>
    <li> I like this iron, especially on my daughters very fine, flat hair. It does leave a kink at the top from the flat edge.</li>
    <li> I like it, it is beautiful.</li>
    <li> With this tool now I have no problem with going a second day without having to wash and style my hair.</li>
    <li> I do not like the quality of this at all. I guess you get what you pay for. It was cheap and you can tell. My hair looked more like it was crimped, not beach waves!</li>
    <li> I love this waver. Heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t burn my hair, and the waves hold all day. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Works so great! And fast! I like the high settings!</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy to use. Great for beachy hairstyles</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I have extremely thick hair and this is very fast and looks beautiful</li>
    <li> even on the highest heat setting, it does not curl/wave my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> Finally something that gives great waves without looking poodle like</li>
    <li> I love the waves on this. I usually make the waves smaller after making my first imprint by putting my waver about half way through the wave. It&#x27;s amazing and it&#x27;s easy to get the back</li>
    <li> Did not like this product. Was lookin for a carpet version on the Babyliss deep waver and it&#x27;s exactly what I got cheap.</li>
    <li> It works really well and is easy to use! Very intuitive settings so I don&#x27;t burn my hair off!</li>
    <li> I have barely had this product over 3 months and it&#x27;s falling apart! Needless to say I am a little disappointed in this bed head product. I don&#x27;t know if it gets to hot or what and it doesn&#x27;t take me long to do my whole head but the iron part is actually coming away from the handles. The paint is all bubbled and the plastic is cracking everywhere. I don&#x27;t know how much longer it will last me. But before all that I loved it.</li>
    <li> Not good for ppl with short hair. Should&#x27;ve known!</li>
    <li> I have very curl, fine hair. After im done straightening my hair, I use this (sometimes) and it works perfect. Gets hot quick, and gets hot enough. If you use the right product before crimping your hair, the crimps will last. Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> The heat settings are too high for this, even at the lowest setting. As soon as it touched my hair it started to smoke and all I could smell was burned hair. It does give a wavy look to hair, but it is more like the 80&#x27;s crimp than what you see celebrities doing with their hair today.</li>
    <li> Bulky design, but works well. Haven&#x27;t used it very much since the purchase. But when I did use it a few times it worked very well and did what it was supposed to do, wave my hair - my hair is hard to put curl or wave into it and this worked well.</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint is that there is no safegaurd on this, so anything that&#x27;s metal heats up and will burn you. Think of it as a huge, wavey, curling iron. But it works fine.</li>
    <li> I used this one time and it worked great. I just pulled it out again and it won&#x27;t heat up enough to work. Very frustrating, because now i go to return it and since it&#x27;s been out of the one month window, there are no returns. Like i said, this was only the 2nd time I went to use it, and it only heats to warm, I can hold my finger on it without having to take it off, not hot at all.</li>
    <li> This came very quickly,  I received it 2 days ago in the mail, the packaging was nice and I used it for the first time today! It gives you very nice and defined waves quickly and easily, I used it on the low setting and I have rather thick hair and it worked perfectly, love this product!! :)</li>
    <li> Makes great waves on my hair. Easy to use, gets hot quickly but its easy to get burned if your not careful enough. Other than that, it does the job great, especially for the great price!</li>
    <li> I bought this not realizing how huge it was and was way to much for my thin hair to deal with.  This is better suited for nice thick hair.</li>
    <li> I remember the days back in the 80&#x27;s when I would use a crimping iron on my hair and tease it.  This is the same concept only without the teasing!  I love this deep waver.  It creates beautiful waves that last throughout the day, even in the humid climate that I live in.  My hair is not too big or frizzy either.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier and plan on using this product a lot more in the future.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this last year and I love it. Finally a product that gives awesome beach like waves to African American hair. Works great with or with out extensions and for long or short hair.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  My hair has trouble holding curls (usually falls flat in a matter of a few hours) but with this my hair was still curly even after being in a ponytail at the gym.  I would definately recommend this product!  It is easy to use, and works great.  I love it, and have used it almost everyday since with no problems.  I also have used half of the hairspray I would normally have to use.  It is great!</li>
    <li> This is a very awkward and useless product&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money however I gave it to someone I didn&#x27;t want to pay more money for shipping it back I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to Anyone</li>
    <li> Honestly this is the best hair tool I have everrrr purchased. It&#x27;s very easy and fast to style your hair and it has saved me a lot of time in the morning. I have thin, medium length hair and I have recieved A LOT of compliments ever since I have been using the Deep Waver. I highly recomment this!! I don&#x27;t know what it is about the waves the deep waver creates but guys looove hair like this. :) It&#x27;s a must have in my books.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the one I got was messed up, but on the first use I turned it on and put it on high(heat). A small smoke and burned smell started to come out of the waver. I turned the temperature down and the smoke stopped. So, apparently I can&#x27;t use it at high temperatures. Other than that it seems to do what it is supposed to do. However, as other reviews mentioned the waves look like mermaid&#x27;s hair style. Not the sexy look you are looking for!</li>
    <li> Device is beautiful and wonderful and very easy to use shows excellent results in the simple&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to purchase and enjoy the form and appearance of new</li>
    <li> Does not work. Leaves hair smelling bad. Not worth it. Do not buy</li>
    <li> I love this tool!! It makes big enough waves that you don&#x27;t look like you stepped out of the 80s. Gets very hot, very quick. You can also flip a switch to keep it clamped together when not in use. Not a big deal but really nice for travel/storage.</li>
    <li> Got a lot  of compliments and was easy to handle use it every morning with a heat control spray to keep from overheating my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this waver it is perfect for my hair and the waves stay in all day. Shipping was very fast also. i was very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hairy and most of the curlers i used (Remington/ Conair) were absolutely useless for my thick hair. This isn&#x27;t essentially a curling iron but the waves look so gorgeous that I&#x27;m not complaining. And its damn easy to do by urself too!!!! Full five stars from me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different curling irons and products to try to get my hair to hold curls...nothing has ever worked on my fine, thin hair like the bed head deep waver...i curled it without putting any product in my hair and the curls were still holding 3 days later..!!!  I hope this product lasts for a long time..!!!</li>
    <li> I have super curly hair but wanted relaxed waves- this is perfect! Looks even better the next day! Totally worth the $$</li>
    <li> I had an old revlon waver that broke after about a year of use. I&#x27;ve only used this bed head one a couple times but the waves turn out great and it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> works wonders on straight hair in seconds i love it!!</li>
    <li> WIsh I would have bought it sooner!</li>
    <li> Heats up VERY quickly. It helps if you have someone to help so you don&#x27;t burn your ears, but it is very effective at those waves..</li>
    <li> Meh..was hoping to be much more impressed by this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- beachy waves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- They are frizzy beachy waves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would possibly use this in the summer before going to a very beachy environment, but the waves are way to sloppy to be used for most other occasions. I felt like I rolled out of bed after using it on my straight hair. I recommend buying wand and letting the curls fall to loose waves.</li>
    <li> I had shoulder length hair, and I think it was ok, but it is large and sort of awkward to use on yourself. Probably work better on long hair</li>
    <li> Loved it! Be careful though, it gets really hot!</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter with very long hair loves this styler. She has very thick hair and a lot of it. This styler can get very hot, so it works well for her hair. I will use it on occasion, and I have medium length, medium thickness hair. I typically turn down the temp to about half of maximum, otherwise I think it would fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think the effect does look better on longhair, but I do get compliments on my hair every time I use it. It leaves somewhat of a messy, rocker look on shorter hair (think a slightly tamed down Janis Joplin) :) Also, the waves hold for very long time.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Fun, different, good for long thick hair&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can get very hot; kind of heavy and clunky, not great to store in a drawer</li>
    <li> The &#x27;beachy waves&#x27; this product is said to give you is quite accurate. Sadly, I have about 2 inches below my shoulder length to work with. It honestly looked terrible. Not what I pictured at ALL. Granted, it was possibly my mistake; and I realize now that I can&#x27;t get beachy waves like I wanted unless I have longer hair. Also, the product makes your hair smell HORRIBLE! I&#x27;m not even kidding. So nasty. It&#x27;s like the smell of burnt rubber and rotten eggs.&lt;br /&gt;So my conclusion is, don&#x27;t buy the product if you have short or medium hair length and/or you are super sensitive about your hair smelling foul.</li>
    <li> All around great product. The color itself got my attention and to read the reviews sealed the deal. I have really long hair and it can take awhile to curl. Using this cuts the time in half and really gives me body. It will be great for halloween this year I&#x27;m going as a mermaid.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It works great.  I have stick straight hair that goes past my butt and won&#x27;t hold a curl for nothing.  I can use hair gel, hair spray ect and it just doesn&#x27;t matter it won&#x27;t hold.  I used the bed head deep waver this morning and was out in the wind all day.  My hair still looks as if I just fixed it.  ( I also didn&#x27;t put anything in my hair besides a heat product before using)  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this deep waver!  It creates just enough to make it look \\&quot;unintentional\\&quot; and natural.  Did my daughter&#x27;s hair for homecoming and it was perfect...did my hair for a night out and it was perfect.  Coiled Curls are so 90&#x27;s!  The deep waver is by far the best thing to happen for my hair in a long time!</li>
    <li> It smokes when it touches my hair yes it should be hot but it should not be doing that. the good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t take long to curl or wave your hair but I do not like the look of the wave. Not satisfied</li>
    <li> 1. voltage 110V not 220V in my country .&lt;br /&gt;2, bad function, very poor results</li>
    <li> maybe this works better for REALLY long hair, my hair is a little past my shoulders and when i use this it makes me look like a frizz ball!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this on a recommendation from a hairdresser friend, because I was looking for more body and some fun beach waves. What I got was frizz city- even in conjunction with correct hair care products, serums, and sprays. It is very hard to match up each wave as you move throughout your hair, the heat was inconsistent, and if you are to try to &amp;#34;go over it again,&amp;#34; it straightens rather than waves. Total disappointment.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The only problem I have with it is that I have thick hair so I have to press a little harder and my thumb kills after wards but the results are very much worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  I have hair down to my rear and it&#x27;s really thick... surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t take me more than maybe 20 minutes to style my hair with this.  It&#x27;s very wide and does it&#x27;s job well.  I love the waves it leaves behind.. but I have also had to use this as a straightener for a week when mine broke- and it also worked extremely well for that, too.  For the price.. this thing is a steal for when you want to do something different with your hair but don&#x27;t have all day to do it. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best waver I have ever used!! I have used others that make tiny waves that look &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; and this size looks just like beach waves. LOVE THIS!! My old waver also had a lip on the edge that left creases. The Bed Head Deep Waver is PERFECTLY designed and makes the smoothest waves without any crimping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat adjustment is great. I never need to use the highest setting. A medium heat is perfect and leaves waves that last 2-3 days. My hair is to mid back and I can do my whole head in about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deep waver! I have incredibly thick hair which is very difficult and time consuming to curl, so when I saw this product I was thrilled! With a curling iron, my hair can take over an hour to curl and I can never get the loose beach style waves that I want. All I end up with is a frizzy mess. I tried this out as soon as it arrived, and it works wonderfully. It heats up quickly and produces loose natural-looking waves that last the entire day. Also, rather than taking hours to get curls, it only takes 10-15 minutes! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> Damaged box :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;العلب التي بداخلها القطع وصلتني تالفة للاسف&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that I receive better service in the future</li>
    <li> I love Bed Head hair products. When I saw this I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but after using it, I would buy it over and over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that would give me wave instead of curls and this does the trick. I had gotten a bad hair cut and was told to curl my hair to make it look less noticeable. Instead, I went with waves and I couldn&#x27;t have been happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it sits flat on the counter; no need for a kick stand like on curling irons. It heats up within seconds, doesn&#x27;t smell, and I love the locking feature which makes it easy to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy, especially at the price. I do recommend getting a heat protection spray as it should be used with any type of heat iron to prevent damage to the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy about this waver -- it heats up quickly and does the job. I have long, straight, coarse hair, and I have no trouble getting beautiful waves that stay for a couple of days, even without product in my hair! I&#x27;m not shy about spending money on beauty products, but you don&#x27;t have to do so with this waver. Great deal.</li>
    <li> This is the first \\&quot;waver\\&quot; I have used I saw it recommended by a makeup artist on youtube. The waver uses a huge groove on the inside of the waver to create the deep wave. It creates a nice polished wavy look without the fizziness. This is definitely not a crimper it just makes a very gentle wide spaced wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for someone with at least hair down halfway past the shoulders. Anything shorter than that may not look as nice since the wave is so huge and deep it takes somewhat long hair to show the back and forth wave design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waver itself is on the bulky side and holding it can be a bit awkward. However practice makes perfect and if you can take the time to master this heat tool the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so in a nut shell...&lt;br /&gt;pros: cute results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: bulky and heavy</li>
    <li> I do not like this waver at all.  The temperature dial does not display the temperature so it&#x27;s a guessing game.  The higher temperature dried out my hair and the lower temps did not wavy at all.  This is a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely and completely in love with this!! Def worth the money. It is amazing! The packaging was great and very professional as well as the deep waver itself is amazing. I recommended it to everyone! It was truly a great buy.</li>
    <li> Love this deep waver for the price! I get a lot of compliments when I use it. The waves come out soft not crimpy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this product. The handle makes it easy to use without burning yourself. If you can use a straightener, you can use this waver. It gave my hair a lot of volume and it only took me about 15 minutes to do my whole head. The one complaint I have is the heat adjuster, there is no indication of what the temp is; you basically have to start at low and go all the way to high to get an idea of what temp it is.</li>
    <li> This product is in comparison to my old Conair 3 in 1 hair crimper/straightener. I really like this Bed Head product, it gets hot really quick and gives my hair a really nice wave. Not to confuse it with a crimper which makes your hair look more like undone braids (which is what i&#x27;ve been looking for), I thought i&#x27;d try this instead of a crimper and I was really impressed and I love it. HOWEVER, you must use with caution as this item has not protective anything, I left it on my sink like I would my curling iron and the spot was heating up pretty quick I had to put it on a plate or hang it from my vanity and super caution my kids to stay away from it. Overall after me jabbering on I really enjoy the product and am very much satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I loved this! It worked so well on my hair. It is a little big and heavy to hold but it didn&#x27;t really bother me. After using this my hair still looked great the next day</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. It makes really pretty deep waves and last a few days if I put some gel on my hair.</li>
    <li> does what i wanted. is very easy and fast for a thick head of long hair. very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This tool was easy to use and worked as intended. My one complaint would be that the entire top part of the tool gets hot, including the plastic edges. There was no place to put your off hand to help position the tool. Also, be very careful not to burn your scalp or forehead.  The size of it makes it a bit unwieldy without any heat buffers.</li>
    <li> Love this! Works well and takes little time, and I have long hair!</li>
    <li> The curling iron works fine.</li>
    <li> Awesome waver!  I bought the Bed Head one and the Revlon one at the same time to try both.  The Revlon one is not even in the same realm as this waver.  The waves are deep and the iron gets hot really fast!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this thing! I have thinner hair and this adds so much poof and body</li>
    <li> This does not work very well, my daughter has long hair, we tried it several times. It just makes your hair look like it is a mess.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this hair tool.  I have very long hair that is naturally wavy, but not really curly anymore...so just more of a mess unless I straighten it or use a curling wand (which I love).  I thought this might give a little more &#x27;structure&#x27; to my bed head craziness, but I was disappointed.  I had also hoped that it wouldn&#x27;t require as much time as straightening my hair since it was adding wave to already wavy hair, but again, I was disappointed.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s obvious to most people that this would take as much, or more time to use since you have to work on &#x27;sections&#x27; of your hair at a time...but I&#x27;m a sleep-deprived mother of three boys, so it too me actually USING this tool to figure out that not glaring fact.  Anyway, I don&#x27;t &#x27;hate&#x27; this tool, and it works &#x27;ok&#x27;, but it wasn&#x27;t the solution to my unruly hair issues as I had hoped it would be.  I used it once and now it just takes up space.  For me I will stick to the flat-iron or the curling wand; no middle ground.</li>
    <li> I love this! I just cut off 19 inches and my natural curls lost their shape so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. Its so quick and easy to use on my short hair... I alternate where I use it to make a more natural messy look. Now I kind of wish I had it before I cut my hair!</li>
    <li> Although this items heats up fast and does the job,it is very dangerous in that the outer part  which is very close to your skin also gets hot and if not very careful  can burn yourself which I did at the side of jaw as well as the ear.</li>
    <li> Perfect product for any type of hair. I love this because it&#x27;s ceramic and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair as much as metal crimpers. It&#x27;s also Bedhead and you can&#x27;t go wrong with that brand.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally do anything with my straight hair, but got this to try something different for fun. Oh my gosh....I love the look it gives!! My hair is shoulder blade length. It&#x27;s super easy to use. At first it was tricky to get the waves lined up at each pass on my hair, but I got the trick and can easily do this myself. Seriously, this waver makes very natural looking waves.</li>
    <li> Love it , gets very hot and can burn your hair if your not carful but other than that I love it</li>
    <li> I have never used a waver so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It gave me a look that reminded me of a crimper from the 80&#x27;s- not what I wanted. Also unlike a curling iron which has a metal stand that folds out to allow you to lay it down, I don&#x27;t see a good way to set this down without burning something. I wish I would not have bought it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a waver because I love the way my hair looks when wavy. I usually have my mom french braid it and then let it set. But I can&#x27;t french braid my own hair and I live too far away from her. I usually only get to wear it wavy when I visit. I finally decided just to buy a waver to do it myself, and after lots of research and review reading I decided on this one. I had really long thick hair when I ordered this product and was really nervous when I ordered it because before it arrived I had cut my hair really short. I went from having almost hip length hair to having super short hair, and I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would look with the shorter hair (it is still really thick). I used it the next day after arriving and I was not disappointed! It looked so good!! Now I wave it after every shower and it stays until I wash it again. A little hairspray and I&#x27;m good to go. I get so many compliments on my hair, it&#x27;s ridiculous! I am so happy I bought this product, and now both my sisters want one too. I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Very pretty medium sized waves. Would highly recommend for long hair.</li>
    <li> I love my deep waver. I always wondered how famous actresses got there lovely waves. Well I don&#x27;t have to wonder anymore with this deep waver for I have the same look. It heats up quick and don&#x27;t have to spend to much time crimping Im in love with the end result!</li>
    <li> I love this hair tool. I have long hair so it takes me a while but when I do it it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This thing is great! It gets hot enough to make the waves last and is easy to handle once you get the hang of it! It&#x27;s a summer staple of mine and the waves last even the 2nd day.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN AMAZING HAIR PRODUCT, MY HAIR IS REALLY THICK, SO IT IS VERY HARD TO KEEP A CURL IN IT, BUT WITH THIS MY HAIR STAYS WAVY FOR THREE DAYS, MY ADVICE TO KEEP IT STAYING HOT KEEP IT LOCKED AT ALL TIMES, I WOULD RECOMMEND TO AT LEAST LET IT HEAT UP FOR 15 MINUTES, AND WHEN YOU PUT IT DOWN TO GET ANOTHER STRAND OF HAIR, LOCK IT, AND THE HEAT WILL STAY IN, I NOTICED THIS, THE FIRST TIME, AND PLEASE BE AWARE THAT IT IS TIME CONSUMING, SO I WOULD RECOMMEND PLANNING ON DOING YOUR HAIR ADVANCE, BEFORE GOING TO ANY OCCASION, AND I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND USE SMALLER STRANDS OF HAIR, WILL HELP, MAKE THE WAVES LOOK BEAUTIFUL AND LAST A LONG TIME, AND WILL HELP WITH THE TIME, OF STYLING YOUR HAIR, BUT LOVE THIS HAIR STYLER :-)</li>
    <li> didnt get the waives i expected -- its not much different than using a regular crimper despite its advertisement for bigger waves</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Europe, didn&#x27;t notice this isn&#x27;t dual voltage, but works perfectly with a voltage converter.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for some time, didn&#x27;t  damage my hair at all, just be careful with how much time you spend on each section of the hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and it works perfectly! Highly recommend to anyone that is looking to give their hair a wavy volume</li>
    <li> Okay, so this little Bed Head Deep Waver iron is awesome and a life-saver to anyone who has busy schedule. Little really is an understatement though since the iron is somewhat bulky, but it makes AWESOME waves. I use it to make both tight curls and loose waves. This thing is the secret to Victoria&#x27;s Secret hair in 15 minutes: loose waves look like a beach shoot, deep waves like fashion show.    If you want to feel and LOOK sexy, this iron will do it for you. Also, since the iron gets hot really fast, it takes all of 15-30 minutes for me to do my mid-back length hair and it looks like I spent forever on it.  I had to spend some time learning how to use this iron, and learning how I liked my hair, but the opportunity cost is worth it.    The thing I love most about this iron, is that the curls don&#x27;t fall flat after you go through a grueling workout in the gym. I also have horses, and when I come in after having been outside riding or working with my horses, my curls are still there. If you go out with friends, the curls also last overnight and become waves in the morning. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this Bed Head Deep Waver if you want lasting style. Sounds so cheesy, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
    <li> This tool works pretty good. I&#x27;m still trying to get used to handling it because I&#x27;ve always just straightened my hair and this requires a bit of technique. Practice will make perfect. Overall, it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get really hot not for Black people hair....</li>
    <li> I have another waver, its a revlon triple barrel and it makes smaller waves than this but i wanted to try this one for the bigger beachy waves and it does wonderfully! Its also a little better to use than my revlon one because it has the black plastic at the tip that doesnt get as hot, so when i accidentally bump my arm with it i dont get burned as bad as when it happens with the revlon which is alllllllll metal. it heats up well and stays hot and gives consistent waves that last in my hair all day without using product, which i love. it does slowly start being less wavey but it doesnt lose too much of its waves throughout the day with no product. it might not last that well for others though but my hair tends to accept waves and crimps over curls a whole lot more, so they stay alot longer for me. i have very long, straight, thin hair if that helps.</li>
    <li> Sucked don&#x27;t waste money</li>
    <li> I gave it two stars because it works (as in does the waves really well). However, the fact that the plastic around the metal melted within a month and now it is such a struggle to work with it, made me upset. Cheap plastic... Didnt they realize that cheap plastic around hot metal would MELT!!! ugh... i do not want to buy another one of these although I do want to have the hair that it creates.. I will try to find something else similar to it but this one is just sad now... it used to take 20 minutes now it take an hour because I have to constantly pry it open when it gets stuck because of the melted plastic... so frustrating...</li>
    <li> This deep waver is good for making large crimped waves.  When using it, if you space them farther apart you&#x27;ll get a &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; wave look, or you can space them together as close as the last wave and it will be &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; waved.  The waves have good hold and actually look better hours after fixing your hair, when they have relaxed a bit.  If you run some bio-silk or something through your waves afterward it will look more natural.  This waver heats up fast and gets very hot, I only set it at about medium.  The only thing I did not like about it is the heat adjusting dial is not marked.  I dabbed a dot of nail polish on the setting I use most so I can be sure it&#x27;s not cranked up too high.</li>
    <li> I just received this product today and I immediately tried it! This is perfect if you want to go for a casual beachy look or if you are in a rush, this is the fastest way to style your hair. I have thin, Asian hair and the Waver definitely made my hair voluminous and to have natural waves. This is really easy to use and it does not take too much of your time. I love this product so much I definitely recommend this to everyone!!! :)</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this. I&#x27;ve tried several things to achieve the wavy hair look and have failed every time. This gives me the perfect waves quickly, and they last which something else I&#x27;ve had trouble with, lasting style. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just like product is described. I have medium length hair and it took me 10 minutes to do it all. It lasted all day and still looked fabulous when I got up this morning. A must have!</li>
    <li> I love the product but its very hard to get use too. Not only was my thumb KILLING me, my hair ALWAYS looks terrible when I first finish. It starts to look good in about an hour.</li>
    <li> simple to use, works quickly and well. Once done run some wax through your hair and you have the perfect beach wave look!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair but I had my hair permanently straightened about 7 months ago. I don&#x27;t want curls anymore but needed a change from straight hair. This wave iron was just what I needed. It gets very hot so it doesn&#x27;t take long to get a whole head of perfectly wavy hair. By they way, I have very long (half way past my behind) medium thickness hair.</li>
    <li> Not sure how many wave things were bought before this one but I am glad that we finally found one that my girls like.</li>
    <li> What I loved about this product was the results of the curls. What I disliked was that the handle heats up very much and is difficult to hold.</li>
    <li> great quality for its price!! love the color!!! easy to use, just a little time consuming.. but results are gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;definitely compares with &amp;#34;higher quality name brands&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;probably going to repurchase as gifts</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter for christmas. She used it right away &amp; she loved it !!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ilove the wave effect this causes. It arrived quickly and was exactly what I thought I bought! It gets very hot and is easy to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love. This is amazing. I don&#x27;t know the exact temp. that device goes to, but I put on my heat protectant and hope for the best. It&#x27;s waves are so uniformed and beautiful. It&#x27;s easy to use too. It takes me 10 mins to do my hair, even though it&#x27;s thick</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with thick, relaxed hair. My hair has a limp wave when wet, but I have always wanted a defined wavy texture to my hair, but I have not been able to achieve it. My hair is currently shoulder length and I was worried about other reviewers saying it made their short hair poofy. I had no problem with poofiness and my waves turned out better than I expected. The waver can get hot, and it does take a little while to finish the whole head. I would definitely recommend. Don&#x27;t let short or relaxed hair stop you from buying this amazing waver.</li>
    <li> Love my deep waver! It warms up so fast and I can wave my whole head in 45 minutes (as opposed to 4 hours with a tiny three barrel waver)! I have long, thick hair and this works WONDERFULLY!</li>
    <li> I have the smaller Bed Head purple waver. This works much better than that one since I have long long long hair. But I was expecting a little more from it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it just might not get hot enough. And it smells so weird. But it does work, just not as great as I expected.</li>
    <li> I have very stick-straight hair and I LOVE this waver.  It&#x27;s such a nice change from my typical &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; waves (any curls I try to give myself just fall out into waves no matter what products/tools I use since my hair is so freakin&#x27; straight...).  I use this tool to make slightly messy and &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; waves, and I get a ton of compliments on it.  The waves can last a few days with very minimal morning touch-ups.  I would definitely check out some YouTube videos or something on how to use it most efficiently, but I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> First reaction, &amp;#34;Why does it feel so cheap?&amp;#34; Made in China should take care of that. I would advise you not to use it every day, it will kill your hair. This is very easy to use, volumizes like crazy. The results are nice. This works nicely with long hair. I have medium, past shoulder length hair and it makes my hair unexpectedly short after finishing my entire head.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY long hair that doesn&#x27;t always take to curling it. I finally found a curling iron that works for my hair. But, as we all know, females get bored easily and like to change it up. That&#x27;s where this little gem comes into play.&lt;br /&gt;I did some YouTub&#x27;ing before making this purchase because I wanted to see how it work and if it worked. I am so glad I did and went ahead with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It gets really hot but not where it&#x27;s frying your hair and breaking it. I let it sit about a minute before it&#x27;s hot enough to go ahead and starting waving. To curl my hair with a curling iron, it&#x27;s about a 45 minute ordeal. With this product, 10 minutes TOPS! And with NO hairspray, I can wave my hair, go to bed and wake up the next morning with soft, beautiful waves. So, you really get two days worth of hair-do out of this product. My hair also comes out so shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you BedHead for creating this amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> I sent this back! This did not give my hair wave expect for at the top of my head, and that wasn&#x27;t even a wave. Awful awful awful! I sent it straight back!</li>
    <li> My personal opinion.... the waves it creates are UGLY.  I hate this iron.  It&#x27;s not for me.  The iron works fine though, I just don&#x27;t like the outcome.</li>
    <li> I have super fine, super stick straight hair. It takes gallons of hairspray for my hair to hold half the curl that a regular curling iron gives me. Tried this thing this morning, and my waves lasted all day! And because the waves are larger than most, it only took my twenty minutes to do all of my medium length hair. Granted, it was helped with some hairspray, but I&#x27;m seriously impressed by the results with this waver! MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> I love this waver.  This one is a replacement for the last one I had for over a year before I dropped it on our bathroom floor, and the handle broke in half.  I have long, fine hair, and it leaves my hair wavy all day long.  I watched videos on youtube to get an idea of how to use it and make my hair look natural, and I&#x27;ve achieved it pretty well.</li>
    <li> Love this new hair too! I need to play with it a bit more since my hair isn&#x27;t turning out how I expected it to. Works great tho.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! Would highly recommend to any female. Great quality product and takes very little time to style hair with</li>
    <li> Overall this is a really nice product. It does what it is supposed to. I even had the waves last in my hair almost all day. And that is without product, on hair that rarely keeps any curl.&lt;br /&gt;Now my problem is only one that will apply to select few. I am young but I have health issues that cause me to have a really weak grip. My dexterity just isn&#x27;t great anymore. So the diameter of this device is hard to grip and still keep control of it. Also some days my arm strength has a lot to be desired. This thing is heavy.. On my bad days, I just cannot use this thing. Well... unless I have a guest who wants to play hairdresser which has yet to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love and recommend this product! Just a warning for that select few like myself.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this</li>
    <li> I bought this trying to do new stuff with my hair, this made it easy to style my hair and it even looked good! Got lots of compliments too! Looking to do something new to your hair, give it a try!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered other wavers in the past that don&#x27;t seem to hold up. They were either too bulky or weren&#x27;t hot enough and this product has been wonderful so far. It looks more like a wave than a crimper which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> LOVE this deepwaver!! It got here quickly and works really well. My hair turned out great. Awesome product, worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love love love this this tool. I have a really silky hair that it hard to hold a wavy styles .:but this tool works very with my hair , no burning , no damage , no waste of time</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m a huge dumb idiot when it comes to styling my own hair. I can&#x27;t even french braid it! I&#x27;ve tried so many curling wands and irons and products, even a different deep waver that was twice the price of this one but no where near as good. I know there&#x27;s a ton of reviews for this product but I had to throw my 2 cents in because it&#x27;s incredible what this does for me. Even me, who can&#x27;t style my own hair for crap, can use this thing and use it fast. The outcome is curls so soft and wavy that i get an instant confidence boost. i&#x27;m not big headed or anything but i feel so sexy when i use this. my hair just flows in this fairy tale princess kind of a way. it also gives me volume that i&#x27;ve never seen before. i have the thinnest, finest hair on the planet and normally no product can change that... until now. What&#x27;s even more miraculous is that it curls at the roots. i can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive this is compared to other things like it on the market. It takes you from boring and limp hair to Victoria Secret model locks in a matter of minutes. What could be better?</li>
    <li> This works so well. I absolutely love it. I have tried it on all different hair types during girls night and different results but still all beautiful. 3 of my friends have already purchased for themselves. For the price, completely a must have in any girls bathroom.</li>
    <li> I bought this after it was recommended by a friend with similar-length long hair who told me it was &#x27;super easy&#x27; to use.  I agree that the technique is very easy to master, but it takes me more than 30 minutes to style my hair with it, so it&#x27;s only used for special occasions.  I also have the beachwaver which only takes me 10 minutes (and I LOVE it), so it&#x27;s hard to choose this one when styling my hair since it takes so much longer.  It really does look good though.... wish I just had more time or patience in the mornings!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I really love this waver.  It&#x27;s another option for your hair, much easier then straightening.  It does get extremely hot though and I bumped it off my neck.  Still healing.  Would recommend nontheless.</li>
    <li> Works well - is exactly what I was looking for at a great price</li>
    <li> my hair is super difficult and never holds a curl with an iron even if you use a can of hairspray with it..but with this all i can say is wow!it gives me such beautiful waves/curls and they stay!definitely my go to when i want some nice wavy definition instead of my normally flat straight hair.i would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> Did not like the deeper waver at all. It seemed to hot and just made the hair look dry and frizzy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, but my hair ends up looking pretty much natural. I have naturally wavy hair, so I guess I have to continue curly-cue-ing my hair to get more defined curls as, like I mentioned, this is just too close to my natural style.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help get some beachy waves into my naturally curly hair, but the only thing it did was make my hair poof out.  The waves it made weren&#x27;t really waves at all, more like crimps, even when I used it on my hair after a blowout and it was straight. It also felt like it was very drying to my hair.  I regularly wear my curly hair straight, and most people don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s actually curly, so I don&#x27;t have particularly coarse or unruly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work if you have fine, thin hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for thick or coarse hair. A curling wand would probably work better to get uniform, beachy waves.</li>
    <li> I have thin type 2b/c hair, and after growing it out long my hair has been lacking texture and volume at the crown of my head,,,this product remedies just that! I just crimp the top sections of your hair and it becomes much fuller, and lasts all day without styling products. Gotta love big sexy hair!</li>
    <li> love the waves I get with this waver.... long lasting and beautiful results ... heats up fast and also use heat protectant before use</li>
    <li> great product . I love it ! easy way to style your hair love it! I totally recommended expect if you had short hair is probably to big. other than that medium to long hair it work great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for quite some time and thought I&#x27;d leave a review. It&#x27;s got to be the best waver I&#x27;ve ever bought. Bed head makes great durable products(I&#x27;d know...I put it through hell).&lt;br /&gt;Included pics of what it makes my hair look like. I always get compliments when I do my hair with it. Excuse the ridiculous make up....it was Halloween lol and I was a zombie</li>
    <li> This iron does not curl near like i thought it would. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> No good wrong power connection for australia</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright I have to keep it clamped for a long time tho to get a wave which is not practical since I have fine hair you would think it didn&#x27;t take long</li>
    <li> The results were amazing more than I expected.</li>
    <li> Broke literally a couple months after purchasing. Horrible customer service when trying to remedy this issue. No response back from manufacture or seller.</li>
    <li> safty,cool and easy 2 use</li>
    <li> This is not for long, thick hair unless you have all day to complete.  In fifteen minutes I hadn&#x27;t finished 1/10th of my hair.  Probably ok for regular thickness/length of hair.</li>
    <li> It works really good with long hair, the instructions (if you read them) are short,  sweet, and to the point.</li>
    <li> It takes a little bit of practice to get it to look right, but once you get it down, it looks really cute!</li>
    <li> I love this deep waver! I get so many compliments when I use it. It does take a long time to use, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Makes very beautiful waves in your hair. I use it a lot because I have straight hair and don&#x27;t really like how flat it is. The wave maker helps add volume to my hair along with the waves. I would suggest it to people who are looking for a great wave maker.</li>
    <li> This waver does what it is suppose to do as advertised. No complaints or issues. I recommend and would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite waver of all time. My previous waver was a 3-barrel one from Revlon. I really liked that one, but it took forever to do my hair with it. This bedhead waver is amazing--I can get beautiful waves that last days in only about 5-10 minutes in the morning! It&#x27;s so much faster than my other waver! It heats up quickly and has a locking feature. One downside is there is no temp control, but I just don&#x27;t leave it in my hair as long as I normally would--this is probably why it gets my hair styled so unbelievably fast!</li>
    <li> Such a great waver!!  It works on all 3 of my girls (one has thin hair and the other 2 have super thick hair) Easy to use and super cute when it&#x27;s done!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this wave iron. It worked great. However we have had it for about 5 months and it just broke.  Will not heat up anymore.  It&#x27;s a shame the product was built so poorly because when it worked it was great.</li>
    <li> This is a great deep waver. It heats up well, is easy to hold and waves my hair beautifully. It does not have an auto turn off so make sure you unplug it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:fab57f89a63f05968e29c62082d3d933]] My waver caught on FIRE!!!!! I loved my waver for about 3 weeks, and used it consistently to curl my hair. It was super easy and made great curls. But, yesterday, as I was taking a shower, I plugged in my waver to heat up. Only about 10 minutes had passed when my smoke alarm started going off. As soon as I got out, I could smell the stench of burning plastic. I went over to my waver and it literally had melted in half. I quickly unplugged it but it continued to smoke for about 15 minutes. This video doesn&#x27;t capture the smoke very well, but you can see where the plastic melted off the top and where the barrel meets the handle (when I picked it up, the barrel and handle separated completely.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on both my daughters hair. My youngest has straight her and it worked perfectly.  My oldest daughter has curly hair it worked for her but not as good as mt daughter with straight hair. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for beachy waves!</li>
    <li> Love the bed head deep waver. and was shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Personally I do not like this Waver. It didn&#x27;t not wave my hair, no matter how high I turned it up. Also, the handles are really bulky, and is to big for my hands. I am 5&#x27;5, with Medium hands. Normally this is something I wouldnt dream of complaining about; since my hands aren&#x27;t tiny. But this tool is huge. I would return this product, but in order to open the box, you have to tear the plastic in order to pop out the waver.The only good thing about this waver is it being Teal,  and not blue.</li>
    <li> If you need 80&#x27;s hair for your Halloween outfit, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and fun to use for cool wavy hair!</li>
    <li> It is a perfect size for getting the big wavy look I love. I already have wave to my hair, but find this helps keep my look more tame. It reduces the frizzy look. It isn&#x27;t awkward to hold for me. The color is also cute as a side note. Thanks!</li>
    <li> the bed head DEEP WAVER came in within a week ! I was excited when it came , it does its job just like I thought it would , the only thing is that when it heats up it has a weird smell but I think it will wear out in a few months (the smell)</li>
    <li> Love this, it took a few trial and error runs, but now I can get really cute waves in 10 minutes and I have a lot of long hair. I try to wash my hair as little a possible, not in a gross way, but my hair is dry so it&#x27;s better if I only wash it every 3 days. I like to use this on the third day, it covers up potential greasy spots well.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS BIG CURLY HAIR. never fails to receive a compliment!</li>
    <li> I just got in the mail today and used it I love it already, my hair came out amazing! &#x3D;) I would definantly reccomend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair and am always looking for ways to spice up my do so I was excited to try this. The first time I used it I hated my hair so much I wet it and threw it up in a tight bun. However, the second time I used it I tried starting the waves 3-4 inches down from my part (instead of right off my scalp) and I love the way it looks! It adds fun wave and volume. I use this all the time now and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my hair when wearing it. Thanks Bed Head!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t make my hair wavy at all, it looked as if I didn&#x27;t even run it through my hair. This didn&#x27;t do what it claims to do, it was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS EXCELLENT IT REALLY DID PUT GREAT WAVES IN MY HAIR. I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL AT FIRST BUT AFTER I GOT THE WAVER WHICH CAME IN ABOUT 3 DAYS I WAS PLEASANTLY SUPRISED WITH THE RESULTS I REALLY LOVE IT. I HAVE LONG VIRGIN EXTENSIONS AND IT MADE MY HAIR LOOK FULL OF WAVES SO ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THAT IT WORKS WELL ON EXTENSIONS TO.......LOL</li>
    <li> This iron worked only once! After the first use, it no longer heated up at all. I ended up throwing this one away and replacing it with another similar item on Amazon. Not worth sending back, and total waste of money. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I have hair below my shoulders. Not to long but not short. And it works VERY well! LOVE LOVE LOVE! Would look way better on longer hair!</li>
    <li> Makes big waves and body.  Use a heat protector if you wanna preserve hair.  Great for making straight flat hair with lots of body.</li>
    <li> i love the mermaid wave u get with this waver! couldnt be more pleased with this product! thank you very much!</li>
    <li> love the deep wave. i get a lot of compliments and sometimes people think its my own curl. i just wish my hair will keep the curl. even after the spray hold and extra hold, my hair still goes with a flat curl. i like my hair to have volume and curl. :(</li>
    <li> I have only used it once but loved the look. I have long, fine hair so it was perfect for my type.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best tool I have bought for my hair. It takes very little time to use, and the waves hold up wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Awesome crimper!  Gives my hair body, and I love the waves it creates.  Great product, would definately recommend. Perfect heat temps too.</li>
    <li> I used this about 4 times and then it wouldn&#x27;t heat up any more. I am going to try to return it...</li>
    <li> I put this on my amazon wish list and it has been here for quite long. I received this for Christmas and tried it as soon as I got it. Let me just put out here that it is very hot and you have to get the hang of it first. I got a pretty nasty burn on my chest and I had a bed head. Literally. Than I took a shower and started over again and let me tell you, these waves are beautiful! They are large beautiful waves that are truly gorgeous and last long with sugar shock by bed head. I highly reccomeend this product!</li>
    <li> Great styler, makes beautiful waves. My teen daughter has very long hair and this works great on her long thick hair.</li>
    <li> Works great! The heat adjusts so you don&#x27;t have to worry about frying your hair off, it works so much faster than I expected. The waves are pretty and even though my hair is down to my butt the waves last all day long! When I had extentions for some reason that hair always got tangled like a rats nest even though it was human hair. But I removed the extensions and I never have any problems with it anymore.</li>
    <li> When you see this you would think its wonderful but before you&#x27;re done with your whole head of hair your hair is all damaged because you have to apply so much heat</li>
    <li> This waver is fantasic it is super easy to use and you get great wavey summer hair great for the beach looks. Takes no time to do and heats up real quick. I would reccomend this to ladies who want waves not curly hair.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly as pictured. Very light weight. Cheaply made, it can definitely break easily if you&#x27;re a careful person with how/ where you place your things. It holds the hair nicely, you can make your hair have large waves or smaller waves you do need to play with the Deep Waver to get an idea how you would like your hair to look. I have to say this with all honesty if you can use a glove to protect your hands PLEASE DO GET ONE. I can&#x27;t tell you even with the glove you can burn yourself. I have burned my neck numerous times doing lower hairs closer to the neck area. It does take time doing your hair at least it does for me. I have no problem with this product I love it. However it gets extremely hot next to the handle after using for a while. Handle this product with extreme care.</li>
    <li> No I was extremely disappointed with this product..It blew up when I plugged it in for the first time..won&#x27;t be purchasing any thing else from Amazon ...</li>
    <li> Like the product,  only if I could get a little closer to my scalp it would be easier.  I would suggest to not wash your hair right before you do this,  even a couple days dirty with some product this tool works best.  Over all its a nice product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got pretty fine hair, naturally kind of a wavy straight mix but looks messy without making it either one of the two..it doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well but it holds these waves perfectly. Heats up quickly and is easy to use. I have a ton of hair and it probably took me 15 min to do my whole head really well. Arms got kind of tired but now I have toned arms and great hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I have naturally straight hair and this gives my hair some volume and looks like that natural beach wavy hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Does this have a variable temperature? I&#x27;m worried about burning my hair as it is very fine.  Can anyone help?</li>
    <li> Not at all like they described. Definitely NOT for people with a lot, or coarse hair. I even tried it on my youngest daughter, who is 7, still didn&#x27;t work the way they described.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife who normally hates these things because they are hard for the average person to use and get the same results as in a salon.  She had this thing figured out by the second time she used it, and I am now a hero.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas after reading many reviews of this &amp; other products.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is hard to curl &amp; will not hold curls at all.  She was able to wave her mid-back length hair in about 15 minutes holding each lock of hair for a count of 5-10 &amp; set on the highest heat setting.  She loves that it locks so her arm did not get tired.  Her hair looks great, very natural waves that are still holding after 24 hours and sleeping on them.  So happy with this purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. It does curl the hair as advertised.  Unfortunately the lowest heat setting will still burn you.  Wife refuses to use it again.</li>
    <li> I got this and within two days EVERYONE was complimenting on my hair! It is great for all kinds of hair types (Even thick, hard to style hair like mine!) I highly recommend this product and can&#x27;t believe it took this long for me to discover it!</li>
    <li> It works fine, but it just wasn&#x27;t the product for me. Just like it says, the waves are deep. I returned it because my hair is too short for that look.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. My 12 year old used it and it curled her very long, thick hair and the curls stayed in. Thankyou!</li>
    <li> this crimper heats up really fast and cools down really fast and works great, I&#x27;m impressed! I would suggest to anyone who likes deep waves in their hair</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on which brand I should get and finally decided to go with the Bed Head Deep Waver because of so many great reviews and beautiful waves. People loved my hair! It was easy to use, very light. I use the heat half way between low and high for my hair type and the curl locks in less than 5 second, amazing. It gets hot pretty fast. I only leave it on up to 5 second depends on how loose I want it. It holds up really nice all day, even the next day and the day after. I wanted to see how long the curls will last but did not want to let it go more than 2 days. The things I don&#x27;t like about it is where the heat control is located, and the ridges on one side of the handle where you grip the iron. I am not sure how long this waver will last but so far it&#x27;s working great! I love this product. I can fix my hair fast with this and it turn out nice and it last all day. The best part is, if I have an event, I can curl it the night before and wake up with a gorgeous hair only if I don&#x27;t want it too puffy. Save some time. This is the best iron I have by far. I am very satisfied of the quick delivery and met my expectations and more. Everyone has different hair type so hope that this one works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated January 31, 2013:  I forgot to mentioned that another bad thing is that there were no high, low, or medium heat indicator so you will have to guess.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and love using this because it looks like I curled my hair. I get lots of compliments. Very good quality, but be careful because this thing can get really hot.</li>
    <li> The iron heats up fast. My heir stays wavy for a long time and soft and shiny. The latch makes it easier to use and works great!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product  and its cheap it does what it says go for it you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It doesn&#x27;t crimp your hair just gives it nice waves. Easy to use and super fast. Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> OMG ! I loooooooove this thing ! I was a little hesitant about buying it at first because I had never used a waver before, but it was so easy ! You just put it on your hair &amp; hold down for about 10 to 30 seconds depending on how deep you want the wave &amp; just continue to follow the pattern down to the very end. I would recommend this &amp; even buy it as a gift for someone else.</li>
    <li> Love it. Used it today for the first time. I have gotten nothing but compliments all day.I highly recommend it.  Quick and easy!!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.  I bought it to replace the Hot Tools Deep Waver that suddenly stopped working after a handful of uses, which actually cost three times as much as this one did.  The main difference between the Hot Tool iron and this one is that this just has high/low settings, where the other one had temperature settings---not a big deal to me.  Love the pretty turquoise color too.</li>
    <li> I have VERY thin straight hair and this is perfect, I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair so wavy almost like a loose curl, and It&#x27;s not as big&lt;br /&gt;as most people say, It does get super hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;so I used it for the 3rd time today and the heater went out, i had read other&lt;br /&gt;reviews about this happening but didn&#x27;t care and got it anyway well although it&lt;br /&gt;works great i can no longer use it! It gets NO heat anymore, so BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I love my new deep waver! It heats up super fast and stays hot while doing my whole head. The only bad thing is that it sometimes sticks when you try to release your hair.</li>
    <li> Thsi is exactly what my daughter was looking for BIG waves!! Perfect all around!! Would order again and got it ahead of schedule!!</li>
    <li> Meh, this did not work for my hair at all. I have long hair (down just past the middle of my back) and this just didn&#x27;t seem to make it do anything. It looked more like it was crimped than the waves I was hoping for. Got rid of it after I tried it a few times with poor results each time.</li>
    <li> My hair isn&#x27;t thin but its hard for this to clamp enough.  Definitely more crispy than wavy</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this product was going to stand up, seeing as my hair is very frizzy and hard to do almost anything with. This waver gave me non-frizzy waves and I was in love! I wore my hair like that to my senior pictures and I got compliments from everyone! My hair was outstanding! This is a great product and though I do not know personally how it stands with straight hair, I&#x27;ve seen good reviews on it so I am recommending this to everyone, even if your hair isn&#x27;t that long! My hair was long for my senior pictures and since then I&#x27;ve cut it, and it still works like a charm! Just make sure your hair is at least shoulder length (;</li>
    <li> You need very long hair as this is a very deep waver!  My hair length is past my shoulders but the waves were so deep that it looked very weird.  I went with a triple barrel (non-deep) that I *love*.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this waver but it sucked. My hair didn&#x27;t really wave and it looked more like a bad 70s perm... then there was the burnt smell it left! Totally dissatisfied</li>
    <li> I bought this crimper after seeing a friend with big waves.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! Took it with me to get my hair done and my hair stylist used it!&lt;br /&gt;I look like I have naturally beautiful curly hair! I never take that much time to do it right but&lt;br /&gt;Still always get compliments on my hair when it is used!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M EXCITED IT WAS DELIVERED EARLY, AND I WORKS AWESOME MY HAIR LOOK BEAUTIFUL....BUT IT IS A WEIRD SMELL.  Will ORDER AGAIN...</li>
    <li> I have thin very fine blonde hair. I can hardly find a good product to give me volume and long lasting results.. I  decided to give this a try after reading the good reviews.. And WOW! I am officially obsessed! It gives me the perfect beach wave look, heats up quickly, and the style lasts for days! Amazing!</li>
    <li> I just didnt like it because waves are not enough deep&lt;br /&gt;And it is too much heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Also exterior part is too hot to hold..</li>
    <li> My hair frizzed out and looked more puffy than &#x27;wavy&#x27; since it&#x27;s shoulder lengthed.  Be sure to use it on your hair if it&#x27;s longer than shoulder length.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, consistant results. My 9-year-old daughter loves when I use it on her hair. I was expecting something different from the 3-prong waver that I already had (which I&#x27;ve had for 10+ years), but the results were pretty similar. This is more user-friendly than my old one though, easier to use.</li>
    <li> Works for different hair lengths. Gets very hot even on the lowest heat setting. The outside of white part gets extremely hot, so be wary of where you place it when heating up! works very well! I have extremely straight hair which never curls. When I use a straightener to curl my hair, trust me, it doesn&#x27;t stay curled for long. I really recommend this product to people who want wavy hair. The waves stay throughout the day though they do get looser.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. My hair does not hold a curl, it&#x27;s very thick and long. So any normal curling iron just doesn&#x27;t do the job. With this the curls will last for days when I take the time to do it neatly.</li>
    <li> Maybe it was just because of my hair type, but the waver made my hair look awfully frizzy.  Even after using a chi heat serum before.  This was cheaper at the time that I purchased, so Im not really worried about wasting the money.  Maybe some day my daughter will use it for fun.</li>
    <li> I got this to do something different with my stepdaughters fine hair.  It works great, holds for a couple days, she loves it.  I have used it on my hair as well, much thicker and it works really well, I expected a high quality product from Bed Head and that is what I received.</li>
    <li> I find it more flattering to only wave sections of my hair rather than the whole head of hair.  Very easy to use, quick, feels great in my hand, heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it ! I was a little hesitant after reading some reviews that it would burn my hair so just to be safe I used my heat protecting spray by L&#x27;oreal called &#x27;sleek it&#x27;. The waver did absolutely no damage to my hair &amp; it was easy to use.</li>
    <li> Makes some killer waves in my long hair, and easy to use, I just love it!!</li>
    <li> Always getting complements on my hair. I love this product. Have been using this for over a year and it still works great! Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it! (picture is how my hair looks after using the waver)</li>
    <li> Easy to use and makes the right waves!</li>
    <li> It gives your hair a crimp, scrunch, look. If you throw some product in after and mess around with it, it gives it more of a scrunch look which most ppl prefer. It&#x27;s nice to use on a pony tail.</li>
    <li> Fun to have the beach wave with no commitment...love it, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair shortly after buying this and must get more length to use it more often, but the brief time I had to use it, I loved it! My friends come by and borrow this constantly!</li>
    <li> I get pretty waves and can do a punch of other styles with it. I have natural wavy hair and curly on a good day. But this gives a nice fun look.</li>
    <li> I love the Bed Head Deep Waver! It works great and heats up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have to far is that it is a little bit heavy once you&#x27;re about half way through but I also have super long thick hair so it takes me a while to wave it.&lt;br /&gt;I love the beachy look it gives to my hair without it being crimpy. It lasts a lot longer than a regular curl and I can do my hair with it in the morning, throw it up in a bun for work and then let it down after work and it still has all the volume and waves that it did in the morning. Probably the best thing about it is the awesome volume it gives your hair!</li>
    <li> I love it. Was looking for something to give me more natural looking flowing waves than my my \\&quot;crimper\\&quot; &amp; this does the job. Makes my hair beautiful. Love how it locks closed for traveling. &amp; the color of it is a plus as well. Buy it!</li>
    <li> creates amazing waves! I love it! It does take some time to do my hair this way, but it comes out so good.</li>
    <li> I have thin straight medium length hair that all my life would not hold a curl unless I got a spiral perm which was way expensive and very hard to maintain. I bought this on the reviews of others and I have to say that it works wonderful. It gives my hair the soft waving look with fullness that I was looking for, and my hair even stayed waving for about 3 days when I washed it again. I really do love this product! If you are looking for more of a tight wave then I would not recommend this product but if you are looking for a more relaxed wave to your hair and to add fullness then by all means get this product, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> it came in good time and the packaging was perfect. this thing does wonders for my hair. finally a product that doesnt make my hair look frizzy!</li>
    <li> The first 10 times I used this product, it smelled like burnt plastic so I was a tad concerned. Not wanting to return the item, I decided to test it out longer. After a while the smell goes away. I would estimate that it takes about 10 minutes to heat up to your desired temperature. I&#x27;ve had this since December 2011 and it still functions. The material feels quite flimsy but at least it&#x27;s not heavy for when you are holding it for 10 seconds on each piece of hair. The only buttons on this device are &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; , &amp;#34;low and high&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;open and lock.&amp;#34; Open and lock is good for if you are too lazy to hold the device closed. I would suggest not using that function in case you end up putting unnecessary heat strain on your hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well. I always have trouble w/ a curling iron so thought this could be a better alternative for loose, beachy waves. I was very disappointed. The waves are more like 80&#x27;s hairstyle kinks. I would be embarrassed to go out with hair like that! Returned the product.</li>
    <li> My hair is in the middle of straight and curly. It does not look good if I don&#x27;t style it, since some strands dry straight, and some dry wavy. This made styling my hair so much easier and less time-consuming. I don&#x27;t have to use it on all my hair, so it cuts my styling time in half. For beachy waves, use this on random pieces throughout the head. For a sleek look, carefully use on every strand and make sure you are clamping down in the right area, to not mess up the wave pattern. The waves come out really nice and I get compliments all the time. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the wave it leaves but after getting several compliments, I&#x27;m hooked. Heats well. I have very long, layered, medium thick hair. It only takes me 15mns to do full head. I separate hair into four sections. This works for me when I&#x27;m in a hurry. Only thing I can complain is that you have to hold it closed tightly. So my hand gets tired. But wave lasts well until next day. Arrived fast and undamaged.</li>
    <li> This gives your hair amazing waves of Curl and body!  Every time I use it  get tons of compliments on my hair!  You will get body and fullness like you have never seen!  Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful deep waver good quality price product you should get it for not even thinking. I will refer to all my friend.</li>
    <li> I have A LOT of hair and this product works great!  I use this very often and its so easy to use.</li>
    <li> i receive in time&lt;br /&gt;but i dont like much&lt;br /&gt;i prefer curl iron that other product make in my hair&lt;br /&gt;this product is beach look very casual</li>
    <li> I currently own two other hair wavers and this one is by far the best! I love how it waves my hair!</li>
    <li> The waves are smaller than I expected by looking at the product.  I wanted something wider, when done it just looks like it would if I let my hair curl naturally. (I have curls in my hair)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Waver I had trouble curling my hair with your typical curling iron but this works as expected and it does what it says it does. I love the curls they last all day and I love doing my hair curly with this tool all the time. If you don&#x27;t like a normal curling iron get this tool, You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I HAVE STRAIGHT HAIR, MEANING EVEN IF I TRY TO CURL IT WITH A CURLING IRON THEY WILL ONLY LAST ME ABOUT 2 GOOD HOURS. I READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS AND WAS SKEPTICAL BUT IVE BEEN WANTING TO TRY IT FOR SO LONG THAT I FINALLY GAVE IN AND BOY AM I GLAD I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! I RECEIVED MANY COMPLIENTS ON MY HAIR AND EVEN SOME CO-WORKERS WANTED TO PURCHASE IT. DOES TAKE SOME TIME AT FIRST TO GET USED TO BUT AFTER SLEEPING ON IT OVERNIGHT IT LOOKED GREAT IF NOT BETTER. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.</li>
    <li> I love Bed Head products but they tend to be a little more in the price range that im comfortable with. I LOVE this iron, the features and the price was spot on! So happy with it...I had been using a 3 barrel, this provides a very nice wave and depending on the temp you can have a strong curl or a subtle wave. Love it and intend to buy 1 for each woman in my family for Christmas.</li>
    <li> i love this item, got yesterday night, tried it very quickly and it is very easy to use and the effect is really nice!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I really like it. It works great</li>
    <li> Makes great waves, heats up fast and much better than the other brand I had that died.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my triple barrel curling iron died.  The waves are bigger than with the triple barrel, but I like this just as well.  And the best part is that even in the humid South where I live the waves still stay for days if I need them too!  Makes looking decent with a newborn in my case much easier.</li>
    <li> Loved it while it worked. Lasted only two weeks and had to send it back to Amazon for replacement. Hopefully, just a fluke.</li>
    <li> Love it! The irons get extremely hot tho so watch out. Decent delivery time. Def met my expectations</li>
    <li> What a crap tool. Definitely not easy to use and waves hair even worse than traditional curlers. Stay far away.</li>
    <li> This tool gave my hair gorgeous long-lasting waves that I have not been able to achieve with any other device, and it is easy to use and fast.  I have baby fine hair, used it on the lowest heat setting with no product, and my waves and the body it gave were still visible the next morning.  No more bad hair days for me!!</li>
    <li> Creates great waves! The secret is to dry your hair completely, use very little product otherwise your waves will not be nice and soft. I&#x27;ve seen women on YouTube tussle their hair, but I find if I do that my hair loses the nice beachy wave and becomes frizzy, almost &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34;.  I have thin hair and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months now.  I like how my hair looks, but it gets so hot that the plastic at the edge of the handle is melting!</li>
    <li> This tool works pretty good. I&#x27;m still trying to get used to handling it because I&#x27;ve always just straightened my hair and this requires a bit of technique. Practice will make perfect. Overall, it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> This thing is terrible.  Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, but I think it makes your hair look like it&#x27;s been crimped.  There are no luscious waves.  Also, you really have to hold it in your hair for a while in order for it to leave any sort of meaningful curl in it.  This was a total waste of $.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Bed Head Deep Waver. Before buying this I was using the Conair 3 barrel iron and it works nowhere near as good as this. It&#x27;s huge and heavy to use. The Bed Head can be used with one hand. Lightweight. Covers a lot of hair at once. Takes me half the time to do my long thick hair. Very affordable and worth the price. I hesitated for a long time but wish I had tried this a long time ago.</li>
    <li> i love my bed head waver ! it gives me perfect beach waves! i had the hot tools waver and it was a little better than this but more expensive so if your tight budget, and want an awesome waver for sure get this!</li>
    <li> Love the final look with this! I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments! The  only thing that stinks is the time it takes to curl all the hair since I&#x27;ve got very long hair and quite enough of it. Other than the time factor (it takes a while - at least 20 minutes) I love this product!</li>
    <li> What I didn&#x27;t want when I purchased this was for it to act just like a krimper which we all know is way out of style anymore. I found in the directions it tells you to start with the heat on low, I have straight/wavy hair a little past my shoulders and I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s extremely thick, it&#x27;s usually pretty easy to style. I had to have the heat cranked all of the way to get any kind of obvious result. Also I would say it looks more krimped than it does &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not a bad product it&#x27;s a good way to change up my hair styles a little bit and get a little bit of wave without having to strategically wash my hair before bed and tie it up in a tight bun to get wave the next day. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect wavy curls, it is definitly more krimpy looking waves. Not bad for the price though.</li>
    <li> The downside is it gets way to hot. You have to keep away from your face otherwise you will get burned. The waves come out pretty and lasts all day long. Not really worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product and easy for my 13 year old daughter to use and creates great big waves for your hair.</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my hair when I use this.  I have think, dark and long hair and it&#x27;s a breeze to wave my hair with this.  I for the most part just do the bottom 2/3 of my hair as I don&#x27;t want the waves to much by my scalp to make it look more natural.  This did not make my hair frizz like others have said and it&#x27;s so quick and easy to use...definitely a great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compliments I got in one day:  Shiny.  Sexy.  Hollywood hair. Gorgeous.  Beautiful.  Amazing.  Seriously...nobody ever says this stuff about my hair but with this tool and 10 mins tops in the morning to use it...they did!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product. I have Medium-Long hair. First of all, this gets VERY hot...and there is no protection on the sides. Not very safe. I think this would work better on very long hair. Mine is long but in layers. I think the layers is what made my hair look like a large poof ball, instead of nice waves.</li>
    <li> She loves this product!  You can also go on-line and view the product demonstration through YouTube, which helped my daughter figure out exactly how to curl her hair and set the style with other Bed Head products.</li>
    <li> Not really happy with this product as it did not really wave my hair well at all!&lt;br /&gt;A real disappointment!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, but I have been wanting a nice wavy look instead. I never liked the helmet/hat head effect naturally curly hair has the tendency to do. This really works for me. I especially like it because it adds a lot of volume to the crown of my head. Although I have nice curls  I can use this as a touch up to my frizzy days or I can use it to create a loose wavy look. It blends in well with my curly hair. In the pictures the curling iron looks bulky, but it is very easy light weight and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very fast and easy to use! Got many compliments on my hair! Will be getting this for my cousins birthday because she likes it so much!! :)</li>
    <li> now every teen girl is coming over to get their hair done. my daughter is very popular. She looks adorable with hher new waves.</li>
    <li> Creates a nice, smooth deep wave in your hair, but be careful how long you hold the clamps down. It will burn the outer layer of your hair and you end up with a burnt smell for the rest of the day. The smell goes away when you wash your hair, but then so does the wave. Also, you&#x27;re burning your hair! Start low on the heat and then increase gradually if it&#x27;s not enough. You probably shouldn&#x27;t keep the clamp closed on your hair more than 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One annoying thing is that the heat is controlled by a thumb rolling switch - roll it up for hotter, down for cooler. The annoying part is that this switch is right where my thumb needs to go to hold the waver in place. This means I&#x27;m at risk for increasing the heat without realizing it.</li>
    <li> I use this thing everyday in my hair and it gives pretty beach waves. its takes me about 15 minutes to do it. it takes me at least 30 minutes to straighten my hair and an hour to curl it so this thing is fast!</li>
    <li> I didnt try it yet but the packaging is perfect , i got it really quick , and am feeling good about it :D</li>
    <li> Sent this as a gift, and she loves it, was using it before the rest of the gifts were opened.</li>
    <li> My wife specifically wanted this for her birthday. She&#x27;s had it for almost 2 years now and it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to buying her flat irons at least yearly as they seem to wear out pretty fast. The fact that this product has lasted so long for her is a testament to it&#x27;s quality.</li>
    <li> I love this product gives me beautiful waves that last!!!</li>
    <li> I got this about a week ago and expected to get within three or four day. It just came yesterday. I was very excited but I found the packaging hard to open. I then tried it out, but found that it just made my hair puffy. I have not tried putting some smoother in it, but I hope that a mousse, smoother, or gel will help the volume. (The volume is to the sides. Not on top of my head, like it should be.) Overall, it is a good product, but fo thick hair like mine, you need a defrizzer.</li>
    <li> My hair is really long and thin so this gives me tons of volume and lasts until I wash it. It heats up really quick and im able to do all of my hair in 15 min on the lowest heat setting.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and lifeless. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get the perfect beach wave. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every tutorial on Pinterest, hotrollers, curling irons and everything in between. THIS is the best investment I&#x27;ve made. My hair has so much volume and life. And it&#x27;s soft and bouncy. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair! I will be recommending this product to anyone who will listen!</li>
    <li> Purchased this waver for my two daughters for Christmas as they have very straight hair and always long for curls. Based on the good reviews I saw and its reasonable price, I took a chance on this one.  I just spent about 10 minutes working on my younger daughter&#x27;s very fine hair, and we were amazed at how well it worked and how quickly!  In ten minutes she had a pretty full head of awesome natural-looking waves!  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought it for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. The price was reasonable. Definitely would suggest this product to anyone considering it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted. Very easy to use and heats up quickly. The only drawback is that for the temperture you dont know at what setting it is because it dosnt show the numbers. But not a big problem for me because i just put it at the highest temperture because my hair dosnt liked to be curly or wavey, so need all the heat thats possible. Makes very cute waves.</li>
    <li> I was excited at first about this product..I bought this last year--I have literally used it 3 times. And I just pulled it out the other day for my 4th time and it didnt even turn on..Tried other outlets--but no luck. Was bummed--but looked online to find how to get rid of it in an eco-friendly way and found out I could throw it right in with my recyclables. Anyway I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone. I love it! My hair is a similar wavy texture that this creates, but is so thick and heavy that it falls out and is mostly wavy on the under side. I got this in the mail a few weeks ago and I use it all the time. It has a temperature control, which I really like. It makes wearing my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair much easier, and I barely have to use product. If you&#x27;re looking for pretty waves, this is the product to go with. And it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
    <li> Great product, produces these really pretty waves. Only wish is that it had a higher heat setting for thicker hair. Makes it a very very very long journey to get the hairstyle I want.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have long hair so it takes some time to style. Although, the end result is worth it. Several people complimented the look it gave me and if your hair takes well to curl it usually looks just as good the next day!!!</li>
    <li> The deep waver creates beautiful full curls for a relaxed and casual look that always looks stunning! Its easy and only takes a few minutes to create the perfect look!! Definitely recommendable to all!</li>
    <li> easy to use. teen girl loves it.</li>
    <li> The product is fairly large in size, so if you have shoulder length hair or shorter it&#x27;s probably going to be difficult to use. Otherwise the product is amazing. It heats up quickly and the waves come out so naturally and pretty.  Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Saw this on the boob-tube and wanted it. Was not a good idea! I used the low settings and this thing totally burnt my hair. I even used protect spray for my hair and before you start thinking \\&quot;Man her protect spray must be S**t\\&quot; I have to stop you there. I have been using that one for a long time with my \\&quot;Other\\&quot; hair tools just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, this thing is a pain in my you-know-what to hold onto when styling as well. My hands are small since I am a chick but they made this thing for man-hands. I am so not playing. My poor hands where aching when I finished testing it out on a few strands of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waves do come out beautiful if you work the tool the correct way, this can be tiresome and will take a while to get used to, but is worth it for the end results. I still have not found a safe way for me to use this on my hair without it burning it, so I don&#x27;t get to use it. I have thinner long hair in case you want to take note and I suggest that you go on said boob-tube and watch some tutorials on how to work this if you think about purchasing.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this if you&#x27;re running late...it seriously takes 20 mins to cool off  . Besides that it works good.</li>
    <li> This works great for waves, although made my hair super frizzy and I don&#x27;t typically have a problem with frizz.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this waver!! I have extensions that dry wavy (if I don&#x27;t straighten it) so I wanted a waver that would blend my natural, kinky hair with the extensions. First, I straightened my hair with a blow dryer,then used the waver. Made my hair blend perfectly. My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. It burns the scalp</li>
    <li> i bought this hoping i could get one of those vintage looking waves, but the waver does a terrible job. it looks strange when you wave the hair. i would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair look great tool</li>
    <li> Love my new wave iron! It works amazing! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of thick hair. This is the fastest, easiest way to style my hair. Works great! I bought one for my daughter but I&#x27;m getting one for myself too!</li>
    <li> This thing is a DREAM! I absolutely loooooooove this product! I have very curly hair (3B) and when I flat iron it and get it stick straight it was nice; however, I wanted to try something new, I wanted to try to see how &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34; would look on me. this product delivered! It is so simple all you do is allow it to heat up, apply to your straight hair for about 5 to 10 seconds and voila! Instant waves! I even love the color of this thing! Also, it is easy to store. I do recommend to handle this product with extreme caution, the plates that do the work get EXTREMELY hot; however, I would assume that all styling products that use heat will be handled with caution.</li>
    <li> This prouduct makes amazing waves. The only complaint i have is that it smells like burning hair and constantly smoking which is slightly unsettling. Also the handel does get very hot, other than those things i highly reccomend this!</li>
    <li> Does not work very well on my thick hair even if I straighten it first. This would likely only work well if you have fine straight hair.</li>
    <li> Love love love this waver!  I have thick slightly wavy hair and this heats up nicely and adds the oomph I need when I don&#x27;t want to fuss with my hair!  I spritz on some product and wave away!</li>
    <li> Love This it works great.</li>
    <li> This waver heats up really fast and the waves it makes is like the waves in the picture! :) i recommend it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t really know how to curl their own hair. :))</li>
    <li> I like this - can&#x27;t say I love it as much as some reviewers. But its easy to use. For me the waves are al little too kinky.</li>
    <li> this works wonderfully! it is so pretty and does such great waves.. i only wish there was some sort of casing lining it, because it gets hot wherever it is metal. and so that is stressful! just hoping and praying you don&#x27;t drop it... and burn yourself... but other than that, this is the PERFECT waver!!! my daughters love when their hair is waved! thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a horrible styling tool.  The effect is not soft beachy waves but crimped on the 80&#x27;s supersized.  If it had been more than $20 I would send it back....</li>
    <li> Looks so pretty on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She wanted a crimper, this was my alternate choice!</li>
    <li> I had no idea that this would be my favorite tool to use on my hair.  It&#x27;s super easy and great to use on adults and children.  My 7 year old loves me to use it on her too.  I wash her hair at night and sometimes in the morning she has slept in hair and after I use the waver for about 5 minutes she looks ready to go.  LOVE this.</li>
    <li> Would give more stars.  Great,  I get soooooo many compliments when I do my hair with this.  Easy to use  I don&#x27;t even use a protector spray and it makes my hair baby butt soft.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! I can do my long thick hair in less than 30 minutes (takes me 40 to straighten it) and the curls last for several days!</li>
    <li> It works really well! I use it all the time. It is also really easy to use. I defiantly suggest it to anyone who wants big waves in their hair!</li>
    <li> Am I using this wrong or something? I purchased this because I saw a few girls on Youtube do some tutorials on this product and I LOVED the results. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to look that good on my hair for some reason. I&#x27;m still gonna keep at it and see if maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong or not long enough (although the smell of my hair burning has indicated that I am definitely doing it long enough). It just sucks as I&#x27;ve seen other women have some really great results from this waver. Perhaps mine is defective?</li>
    <li> i love the irons i am so happy with this i hsave been wanted to buy them but found them on amazon i cant to use them</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair.  This product makes it so easy to get a different look relatively fast, and easy too!&lt;br /&gt;It only took me a few minutes to figure out.  It is a bit awkward at first.  I use this a lot.  And the price is great!  Plus I love the bright color!&lt;br /&gt;It really makes me feel beautiful.  I get compliments on my hair whenever I use it.&lt;br /&gt;The waves last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the lock feature, makes it really easy for me to store it.&lt;br /&gt;WONDERFUL&lt;br /&gt;-Liz Czaja</li>
    <li> I like this because it doesn&#x27;t overheat my hair. I dropped it once and the little lock broke. Thought it would be a lil heavier duty but no biggie as long as it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair</li>
    <li> Ever since I bought this, I have not stopped using it. This product provides big gorgeous waves. I have very thick shoulder length hair, and I will tell you what, it is amazing. I have always been the person to just keep my hair straight, not really wanting to do my hair differently until I bought this product. Now I am wearing my hair in all different ways with this bed head waver. This is product is cheaper online than it is at the store, especially when you can have this shipped for free. So, if your willing to jump out of your comfort zone and wanting something fun and different to do with your hair than I definitely recommend this bed head for sure!</li>
    <li> OMG ANYONE WHO HAS STRAIGHT HAIR NEEDS THIS! My best friend got one for christmas and she curled my hair with it once and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. Its not like a curling iron that wraps around your hair a hundred times, my hair is really really really long so it takes forever for a curling iron to do anything to my hair at all, but it creates waves in sections and they stay all day! I love this steam waver more than any other curling product I have ever used and I have tried and tried and tried for at least 10 years to find a way to hot curl my hair and have it look pretty all day without excessive hairspray/gels and this is it!</li>
    <li> I purchase this waiver for my daughter she loved she loved it I used i I used in my hair for the first time I got s I got so many compliments and the way stays in days after this was a grea this was a great buy</li>
    <li> This waver works amazing on my fine hair and gives me tons of volume, which I have a hard time creating with my other hair tools. I can even use it to freshen up my second day hair look, when I would not normally be able to do anything else with it. I would definitely recommend this product because it makes your hair beautifully and naturally wavy without much effort at all!</li>
    <li> My hair is shoulder length, straight and a little on the fine side. This waver is easy to use and gives my hair easy waves and body. I use it a couple time a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now about 4-5 times. I super love it. I have thin fine hair that is boring so I bought this to help give my hair some life. I get compliments all day at work or when I am out with friends on how great my hair is. I have hair passed my shoulders and like I said very thin fine hair and takes me about 10 minutes to do my entire head and it looks flawless. Another great thing you can wear the same waves the following day when I wake up it still looks amazing, I just brush it out a little and still holds and I DID NOT use any hair product!!!! I would recommend this to anyone :)</li>
    <li> Package arrived when promised. I just played with it with my hair just to see if I&#x27;d get desired effect (I have alot of hair thats thick/difficult &amp; its usually hard to find a iron that gets hot enough) but this did awesome. It made full body waves that lasted/looked good for 2 days (I wash hair every other day) I cant wait to really get down &amp; do my full head of hair. I did my step daughters hair (she has lots of long baby fine hair thats to her bottom) all in about 5 minutes! It was quick and turned out so beautiful! So far very pleased with purchase :)</li>
    <li> I have impossible f***ing hair. It is long, thick, and very straight. I can spend hours curling, and by the time I am finished, the side I started on is already flat. Not wavy, FLAT. Until purchasing this product, I had pretty much given up on styling my hair altogether. This wave iron was a last ditch effort at trying something new. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results. The picture I am posting is what my hair looked like 12 HOURS AFTER using this wave iron.</li>
    <li> Works well on my crazy jungle woman hair. I like the volume it provides as well. Glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I like this product and I beleive that it is the best over competitors. I told all my friends about it .</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this because I have chin length hair and after doing research, I saw that most people using wavers have much longer hair than mine. Still, I took the plunge because I was sure I could do a quick, easy hairstyle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some trial and error to get my technique down, but now I am finding myself reaching for this waver more than any other heat tool I own. My hair is chin length and very fine. I start with air dried hair and spray on a bit of dry shampoo to give it a little more grip. I have found that taking small vertical sections of hair gives me a more beachy, loose wave than holding it horizontally, which tends to look a bit more 1920s flapper. I finish with a small amount of gloss serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased with my pick and would highly recommend to anyone who is super busy that wants a cute hairstyle done in a flash. I&#x27;ll use this for many years to come.</li>
    <li> My hair is SUPER straight and long. It takes FOREVER to get it to curl or wave, and when it does it never stays that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this I was hesitant because of how fine/straight my hair is, but this literally works wonders on my hair. It stays in beautiful waves all day with just the use of some hairspray after I&#x27;m done, and it even stays wavy the next day too if I don&#x27;t wash it. I get so many compliments on how pretty my hair looks. I&#x27;ve discovered it looks best if I start not at the root but a little further down, then stop before the end so its straight at the ends. Also another great thing is its easy to store because it has a &amp;#34;lock option&amp;#34; and it heats up SO FAST. Love this product :)</li>
    <li> I have very straight very long hair - I am always on the look out for ways to change it up. This works very well. It get VERY hot - I only use it occasionally. I could see it damaging hair if used daily. Definately use heat protection spray. I like that it gives me large waves - not crimpy like the 3 barrel curling irons. I was pleasantly surprised at how fast I could wave my whole head - It only takes about 10 min or so. Overall very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Maybe if I had longer hair the barrel wouldn&#x27;t have intimidated as much, I kept thinking I was going to burn myself. The end result was nice but since I didn&#x27;t use any hairspray to hold it in you couldn&#x27;t tell that I had actually done my hair, it just looked like a normal day and my husband couldn&#x27;t see a difference. Next time I&#x27;ll use a bit of hairspray and see what happens.</li>
    <li> This is by far my ultimate favorite styling utensil ever. I love the beachy waves I get. It is such an amazing product. I love love love using it. It does get very hot so if you do buy it, learn how to use it but its super easy to use and it&#x27;s the BEST!!!!! It&#x27;s so worth your money because it does it&#x27;s function. &amp;#60;3333</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and find that I use it just as much as she does. We both have thick, fine hair. I use a setting spray on my hair before each section of hair that I use the iron on. My hair is normally straight with no curl. After using this wave iron, I have a ton of body in my hair and can easily put my hair up and it looks full and curly. My daughter uses the wave iron and she love it too!</li>
    <li> Easy to use! Hair turns out cute!</li>
    <li> I seriously have the thinnest hair that barely holds curls. I also am not awesome at hair tools. I am beyond excited i bought this waver! Goodbye boring hair!! If you think you wont be able to use it, think again. Its pretty easy, literally took it out of the package, fired it up and off i went! My hair is shiney and wavy! You will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful deep waves.,that last all day! !!</li>
    <li> I have jus past chin length very thick hair so it took a couple of tries to find the best way to use it for my hair, but it is fantastic. The waves are very pretty and last for days.</li>
    <li> I love this hair waiver! It gives me a completely different look without damaging my hair with any permanent chemicals.  The waves stay all day without needing touchups,  unless like a curling iron.  I have used it 4 times since I received it only a couple of weeks ago.  I followed the steps after watching the video attached to this product, and it doesn&#x27;t take me much time at all!  I will recommend it to anyone looking for a new look!</li>
    <li> I love this waver.  I have very long and VERY thick hair and this works great on it.  Nice soft waves that look beautiful.  I would definitely reccomend this item.</li>
    <li> Ordered one for both my 9 year old and 12 year old granddaughters who have straight fine hair.  This is the ONLY tool we&#x27;ve ever had that actually puts waves in their hair and it holds for 2 days (instead of the usual 45 minutes!)  Now their mothers want one for themselves, too!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this, don&#x27;t tell my husband! 😊 I have very long hair (comes down to the middle of my rear end) yes, I know it&#x27;s long. But, it&#x27;s not like those religious people&#x27;s hair (even though I am a Christian) I take pride in my hair and love to style it. I have a 4 and 2 year old so I have been having to do my hair with a bump at the top with the rest of it straightened. I wanted and needed something different but, fast at the same time. I was able to gorgeously style it with this in 5 minutes. I was so happy with the results and got so many complements. I didn&#x27;t have to stand in the bathroom for an hour with the kids *mommy this, mommy that* the whole time. You will not go wrong buying this.</li>
    <li> It is heavy, bulky, and awkward to use. However, I feel very safe using it; I have not burned my fingers yet. Also, I feel that my hair is protected by the ceramic, no burns or fried ends. For a hair waver, it is a good product, I guess.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all compared to the video I was showed before purchasing. I tried using it and I have long hair and it made my hair look super funny! I did not like it at all!</li>
    <li> . Would have been a 5 star if I could&#x27;ve got a tighter wave but none the less I love them !!</li>
    <li> I love this, it&#x27;s easy to do and works great! First, I&#x27;ve seen complaints about it doesn&#x27;t hold waves, they got burned or they burned their hair. I can tell you these people did not read the manual it came with. The number one thing it tells you is start out on the lowest setting and the bring up the heat, this is so true. I use mine on medium heat and hold it at least 10 seconds or a little more because I have thick shoulder length hair. To prep your hair, I did use their hairspray they recommended, that&#x27;s a nice protective coat and it&#x27;s not sticky so there will be no residue on your waver , then it is VITAL you buy a heat protective spray, it keeps your hair from getting burnt because even on the lowest heat setting if you aren&#x27;t using at least one of the hair products, it&#x27;s very easy to have dried brittle hair after a few uses. As far as it not holding, I recommend hairspray, my hair is very stubborn and won&#x27;t do anything but I used this waver and it works wonderfully! Afterward I just spray it and it&#x27;ll hold till the next morning( and no I don&#x27;t use the mega hold sticky doesn&#x27;t move spray either, it&#x27;s the one they suggest for the product!) For the people burning themselves, I have no clue how it&#x27;s possible, when you use the waver, do not hold it up against your scalp, watch a video on youtube and take the tips. Another lady complained hers locked up and melted together, well....while it&#x27;s cooling you DO NOT lock it. Of course it will melt together. This really is a great product and it&#x27;s a great investment.</li>
    <li> I have very thin poker straight hair. I can never get it to hold a curl let alone a wave. I wish I had this for my wedding day. I would have had way less product in my hair. This was the best thing I could have bought myself for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This is the best iron ever... Love it so much, and I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I use to spend at least $65 to get my hair styled the way this deep waver does it. I noticed my hair stylist used this so I decided to get it &amp; I am so happy I did. I have thick straight hair &amp; lots of it &amp; this does the job, quickly &amp; easily. It lasts me at least three days &amp; I get so many compliments when I get it done. I am also saving at least $130/ month if not more. I use the Tresemme Thermal Creations Leave in Spray before &amp; the Bedhead Masterpiece hairpsray after. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item last summer &amp; I LOVE it. Works great. Achieves the look of mermaid hair or beach hair, which ever works for u!!! Def worth buying.</li>
    <li> Holy cow! What an awesome product. I have thick hair that can&#x27;t decide if it wants to be straight or wavy so it&#x27;s usually just a hot mess by the end of the day. My hair has never been able to hold a curl, but then again to be fair, I have never been one to give real great effort when curling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this device is completely awesome! I received so many compliments on my waves, and it only took me 20 minutes to do my hair! Depending on how long you hold it on your hair allows for a variation in wave type. If you really get a good hold on it and keep it there for a while it resembles more of a bigger crimp. But if you don&#x27;t hold it on so much you get a softer wave. I love this so much and boy does it last. I barely sprayed my hair with product and the day after I did my hair there was still some texture and wave in my hair. Even after I had put it in a pony tail all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon, and that&#x27;s saying a whole lot!!</li>
    <li> Screw 3 barrel curling irons and crimpers! The wave artist is finally the tool that gives you perfect \\&quot;S\\&quot; waves.  It looks like perfect, natural, beach waves.  My sister let me try hers and I&#x27;m in love. Now I have to buy one for myself!  I&#x27;ve never had my hair stay in a style so long! I&#x27;m in love with this tool.  This will definitely be a summer hairstyle staple.  The only thing I recommend is to have a good heat protector since you have to hold it on your hair as you move down each strand.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love, this deep waver!!! I would recommend it to anyone. Great value for money. A must have in my hair styling arsenal.</li>
    <li> My hair does not curl for anything with a curling iron. No matter how much hair spray or mouse or gel I use. I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. This item is absolutely amazing. So many people say they love my hair when I use it. And ask if my hair is naturally curly. Highly suggest this item to everyone!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair accessory ever. It literally takes 5-10 minutes to curl my whole head.  After I use hairspray, the curl really stays.  When I am in a rush and I do not have time to straighten my hair, I use the bed head deep waver.  I encourage you to buy it, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i wanted, extremely easy to use.  The wave lasted 2 days before i washed my hair.  Highly recommend.  I have extremely straight hair and had great results!</li>
    <li> I have very long hair that usually cannot hold a curl for longer than 2 hours, but this waver is amazing.  Fast and easy to use, and the waves last all day (even after sleeping on them!). i HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> Definitely did NOT work on my hair.  I have stick-straight, thin, shoulder-length hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this deep waver. It gives volume to my roots which is hard to do, and it looks so pretty, and lasts all day</li>
    <li> works great and it heats up fast. i use it every morning and it only takes 10 minutes to do my whole head!</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight hair and creating tousled, beachy waves has been a lifelong quest. This waver does it perfectly, and the waves stay all day and even look good the next day. It didn&#x27;t take long at all to figure out how to line up the waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only warning about this is that it is very, very hot. If you&#x27;re using the highest heat setting or anywhere near it, you&#x27;ll only need to hold the waver on each section for 3-5 SECONDS! Seriously, don&#x27;t overdo it, and use a heat protectant. Other than that, this is the best hairstyling tool I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect item to get nice waves in your hair!  It&#x27;s a must buy and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Love the subtle waves that I get from this. I&#x27;ve always had a difficult time perfecting the wave via curling irons so this was the solution! Works so well.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE it! It&#x27;s my favorite styling tool!</li>
    <li> This Deep Waver is awesomeness!! The Waves Are Long lasting in my hair! Love it and so worth the Money!!</li>
    <li> I am hair styling challenged. This tool is wonderful! Easy to use with great results! Would buy as a gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> This is a great little waver but it seemed like a crimper to me so I will be using less product and opting for a more natural wavey look soon. Make sure you are using a heat protector on your hair first.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today. It was estimated to be shipped today so i was patiently waiting to get it. I didn&#x27;t take a lot of time to do my hair I only did it quickly and I loved the curls :) I have naturally wave/curly hair but I think that they are really ugly on me, but I absolutely adore finger curls (beach curls). I am super happy with this product :)&lt;br /&gt;I know that when I put more time into doing my hair it&#x27;ll come out even better.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money! Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I took time doing my hair and using this product and the curls came out great! I absolutely love them! And they basically stayed for the whole day!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, super fast ! took 15 mins to get my whole head done. Very wavy, consistent. I am a dummy in hair styling but this is so easy to use! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great hair investment! Easy fast and the waves last!  I love it.</li>
    <li> This product is fun for parties, but it looks even better if you wave your hair before bed. Your hair will have big loose waves and it looks super natural.</li>
    <li> I tried this thing twice and ended up giving it to a friend becuase I hated it. It only makes your hair frizzy. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this, but its not east at all to do it on yourself.</li>
    <li> This thing is huge. The waves it makes are huge. If you&#x27;re looking for natural looking waves, get one of the three-pronged curling irons, but if you want dramatic bedhead, this is your waver. It heats up quickly, sets quickly, and lasts all day and night. I used a bit of styling cream, but not a ton, and I didn&#x27;t use hairspray. My waves still looked passable when I got up the next morning.</li>
    <li> Made my hair wavy, my hair is thick and long so for this to work is awesome</li>
    <li> I love it soo much, my hair looks pretty wavy classy and it stays for very long</li>
    <li> Love the waves I get with this tool but you need to be careful and part your hair into small sections.  Large sections will cause the lock to break or become loose.  Very easy and quick to use.</li>
    <li> I love it! I love the way my hair turns out with this iron!</li>
    <li> Excellent  product - easy to use</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this waver. I have long straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl well, but this waver really works well with my hair and gives it a lot of volume and body. It takes me about 20 minutes tops do my hair with this waver but it lasts all day and into the next day. You should defintely try if you are looking for something different than your average curl.</li>
    <li> Bulky item and not for only shoulder length hair. I returned product</li>
    <li> Made my hair fuzzy. I will give it away. Sorry not for me.</li>
    <li> Love love love it! I bought this product for my 6 yr old daughter... She has really long hair and I was looking for additional styling options. This waiver makes her hair look fuller especially when it&#x27;s in a ponytail! I recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a waiver.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect tool to have in your arsenal.  I wear my hair straight a lot.  Sometimes I&#x27;d like a little curls.  But this is the ultimate crimping tool.  It gives you large crimps that last and resembles a large deep wave.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I used our waver once each. Loved the wave it gave us. They stayed in beautifully for two days. The third day we owned it, it wouldn&#x27;t heat up. It was never dropped, or even moved from out counter and it just stopped working. Disappointed!</li>
    <li> When I got this I was happy after a while it melted and I could not use it, all though I did like using it.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, and long, and it gives a great look. I only have to hold it about five seconds per section. Takes me about 25 minutes to do my whole head.</li>
    <li> This bed head deep waver gives my hair a different look adding subtle waves throughout my hair. It&#x27;s a great part of my styling tools collection. It doesn&#x27;t create big voluminous waves; it creates more pretty subtle waves.</li>
    <li> I have fine, very stubbourn hair, and I love this thing. It is fast to curl and stays for days! I slept with my hair waved, and I can go out with bed head from the night before, just freshen a little and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> Was disappointed it was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I have thin, super-straight hair and all my attempts to get the beach wave look with a curling iron have been unsuccessful. But, the Bed Head Deep Waver does the trick! It&#x27;s like a huge crimper, and it only takes me about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair look so beautiful. it&#x27;s a really great tool and it&#x27;s so easy to use -- plus, I never burn myself!</li>
    <li> This product makes great waves, easy to use.  It is a Bed Head Product,  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Love this I&#x27;m still trying it out as far as how and styles but u tube videos have been great. It holds very good and last all day</li>
    <li> I have not hurt myself yet.  I have not achieved the same deep beach waves as depicted in the photos either.  I think I would have to keep my hair clamped in the thing until it smoked to achieve that, which is not something I am willing to do.  It does produce some lovely light waves that linger for more than a day, and that is still kind of a nice change.</li>
    <li> my hairs naturally curly so before i can even wave it i have to straighten it for me thats a big hassle, but if you love getting ready this is perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Was very intimidated at first, as I don&#x27;t do a whole lot with my hair. But this turned out to be super easy. Would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite waver!! It&#x27;s awesome if you want wavy hair!! Love it!</li>
    <li> seems cheaply made. i used mine once but i stopped using it because it was frying my hair for the amount of time i had to hold it there to get the perfect wave. (my hair does not hold curls well though to begin with)</li>
    <li> Never got around to wave my hair until I saw a Cosmo article about it..of course..it brought me to amazon and I sifted through reviews and bought this one. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months now and use it 2-3 times a week and it works great. If it crimps funny its my doing, and I fix it with a bobby pin. Heats up fast and does the job, great product.</li>
    <li> On my first try I got the beach waves and volume I was looking for, in a short amount of time. It does what it says.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancee and lets just say she loves it and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and I got the hairstyle I wanted,I love it. You can either use it before bed and wake up with the true bedhead look or if you have short hair-medium length hair you can do it in a quick five -ten minutes before work or leaving the house for a party or something,it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my thick long hair.</li>
    <li> I finally am able to have natural wavy looking hair. I get so many compliments when I use this. My hair is normally stick thin straight and I can&#x27;t keep a curl. I can actually keep the wave (as long as you use hairspray like they recommend). Great product!</li>
    <li> This works really well and my complaints are minor. The handle is weirdly textured, sort of hurts my hand and the power button sticks a little. Other than that it works better than expected. Works best on straight hair, so if your curly like me you&#x27;ll want to blow out before instead of air drying.</li>
    <li> This deep waver met and exceeded my expectations!  It&#x27;s simple to use and can be used to create a variety of wave styles.  My hair is very fine and doesn&#x27;t typically hold curls well, but these waves have lasted for two days, going from a sharp wave to a very loose and natural wave by the second day, without having to use hairspray or mousse.  A great deep waver for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I used this amazing thing today for the first time and I fell in love! (: gives my hair so much volume!!</li>
    <li> Got this item for my wife. Was debating between this and the Hot tools version. This was quite a bit cheaper and does a fantastic job. Save your money and go with this deep waver!</li>
    <li> Love it. I have flat fine hair that when curled loses the curl in a matter of minutes. However not with this waver, it&#x27;s actually lasts all day and looks good. It also takes only minutes to do your hair.</li>
    <li> I could never really wave my hair before and had used product over product and never got the results that this yielded!</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful waves that mostly last even in my daughter&#x27;s heavy hair.  Wish the tip was larger because we are used to gripping there and there is not cool tip.  Bought a heat glove to use w/it but it was a dud and we haven&#x27;t tried another.  The waver is great though and works in thick hair that is sectioned properly.  Easy to use.  Gets got quickly.  Has a lock function for storage.</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to but this is a good product.</li>
    <li> I highly recomend this to anyone who wants to get Beachy waves and was just the best product.  But one thing I will tell you is that if you wave only one section of hair and then change your mind and want it straight it will not straighten.  But overall I ranked this a 4 because I wanted it to have a variation of different colors.</li>
    <li> I was worried that this would not work but it works great!! My hair is hard to curl and to hold curl but I have waves all day when I use this and it is not frizzy.</li>
    <li> I love this waver, specially because I didn&#x27;t have any experience waving my hair before, my sister got an conair and I did not like, it was really hard to figure it out, this Iron is super easy to use and after the 2nd time you do it, you are pretty much a professional! love love loveeeee :)</li>
    <li> Purchased the Bed Head Deep Waver for my daughter.  She uses it often and likes the look it gives her hair</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great and creates a nice look in a relatively short amount of time.  So glad I decided to buy it!</li>
    <li> If you want beach waves this is a must have!  Its leaves my hair soft and shiny with a beautiful beach (mermaid) curls.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the best deep wave iron, and didn&#x27;t have much to spend. Ulta was one of my first stops, and this same model sells for $40 once you include the shipping. For $43 dollars I was able to buy not only the Bead Head deep waver, but also the Remington curling wand, and both tools were super saver no shipping on orders more than $25. This deep wave iron give a variety of styles, depending on how you position. Love it, and As a Licensed hairstylist, I know that bedhead tools are very expensive when bought at the salon. Excellent product, heats up superfast and delivers beautiful deep waves. Very happy. Amazon is always the first place I check for anything I want to get a good price for.</li>
    <li> Great styling product! My hair looks so good after using this! And its cheap too! Love it!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy, so I bought this to use on my hair extensions hoping it would make them match the texture of my natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this waver straightens my hair unless I hold it in place for about 20 seconds, which then causes my hair to have a weird smell and the waver produces lots of smoke.&lt;br /&gt;It also takes a loooooong time to do all of your hair with this.</li>
    <li> I have fine, poker straight hair. I&#x27;ve watched perms fall out. But I saw this on a FB video and decided to give it a try. WOW! I can do all my hair in five minutes and with a little hair spray (I also pretreated my hair with mousse) it not only stayed wavy, but was still wavy the next morning! It gave my lifeless hair body and a cute beachy look! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  Her hair is hard to curl, but did worked and better than she expected.</li>
    <li> My daughter says this is the best waver she has ever had.  Personally, I haven&#x27;t used anything like this since crimpers in the 80s but I tried it yesterday and was very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Good product. Was just like in the picture</li>
    <li> This Bed Head Deep Waver makes the most beautiful deep waves you will ever see on hair. I brought this device with me to Florida on a brief vacation with my friend who is getting married. I used this on her hair and she would not let it go....when we returned back home..she decided she wanted to keep it....so I ordered another one for myself. Worth every penny! Love this Product and so does my friend!</li>
    <li> Works really good! Easy to use!</li>
    <li> I love this crimper for big beach waves works perfect and doesn&#x27;t leave ugly creases.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Takes half the time as curling iron.  Love the waves.  Buy it !!</li>
    <li> Best waver ever. Pretty much the only thing that holds the curl in my completely straight hair. I put no product in and the wave stays for 2 days! Gives great volume, doesn&#x27;t damage hair. It actually looks shinier after use. Since this purchase, 3 of my girlfriends bought this product and loved it. I have all kinds of wands and curling irons, but this is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t come undone after an hour. I don&#x27;t even put hairspray, as I really don&#x27;t like how it feels. I very much recommend this waver to anyone who has problem with their style staying put all day long.</li>
    <li> This product is very good at making a wave very quickly without much time on the hair.  However, with my shoulder-length hair, the waves are way too large.  It would be more appropriate for long hair.  I wish there were a wave maker that was between a crimp and this product.</li>
    <li> Love it my hair looks great and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I didnt love this.. it made my hair look like the bride of Frankenstein.</li>
    <li> I love this DEEP waver!  I have purchased several other products in the past and this is the first one that does exactly what I was hoping for.  I found it very easy to use, and comfortable to handle.  I used it on my hair yesterday for the first time, and was so excited to see the results.  My hair was shiny, bouncy, and the deep waves looked amazing. Day two, and it looks even better.  My husband and daughters thought I had been to the hair salon, and complemented me on how nice my hair looked.  This is the best wave iron I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;m a happy customer!  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this and everyone who sees my hair asks me what I did to get such beautiful curls! They have no idea - how easy it was ;-)</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, decided I need to buy this. Was not impressed. Didn&#x27;t make cute waves. Made frizzy mess!</li>
    <li> Attached picture is how it curls your hair. Works AMAZING and stays in for days. I love this deep waver!! Would suggest it to anyone and shipped very fast too.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying a waver.  I previously bought another product advertised as a &amp;#34;waver&amp;#34; that turned out to be more of a crimper.  This one has great reviews and my experience matched those.  I was looking for something that created loose waves that looked fairly natural.  I was also looking for something that would be quick and easy and I didn&#x27;t find it to be as quick as I hoped.  It was smaller than I expected and having thick hair, I had to separate my hair into at least 3 layers.  However, it works really well and looks very cute.  It won&#x27;t be the cure all for bad hair days I had hoped.  But it is quicker than straightening or curling so it will be in my repertoire!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Easy to use.. Nice results</li>
    <li> Worked great on my wife&#x27;s hair she loved it.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, but sometimes you want something different. I will blow out/straighten my hair, then use this waver. Big, beachy waves! Looks so great. My hair is usually a funny color (last was pink, now it&#x27;s half blue, half purple). Definitely helps me pop out with the big waves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a dial so you can set it&#x27;s peak amount of heat, once you figure out what works for you. Great if you don&#x27;t want to over heat your hair.</li>
    <li> Gets way too hot, leaves hair dry and frizzy in just seconds...in order to produce a decent wave it has to be used for around 30 seconds. Can&#x27;t use longer than 5 seconds (which is not long enough)...but these 5 seconds are long enough to fry my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Trying to return.</li>
    <li> I agree with some other reviewers that this is not at all what I was expecting.  This creates early 90&#x27;s-looking crimped hair - nothing natural or beach-y looking at all!  Also made my hair frizzy.  Yuck.  Going right into the give-away pile.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the way it works for the top of my head.  I ended up giving it away...</li>
    <li> Love it! Arrived here fast and Im in love with it. Thanks so much for sending it that fast. I was able to get it in time for a wedding :)</li>
    <li> I was amazed by how well this hair waver works! Normally, my hair is nearly impossible to straighten and it cannot hold a curl, but this thing seemed to work miracles. Even on low heat, it gives my hair beautiful, natural-looking waves that actually stay in throughout the day! It is also extremely quick and easy to use, so it is convenient in the morning. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews of this product creating \\&quot;crimpy\\&quot; waves I was on the fence. i decided to go ahead and purchase because I could always return it. I&#x27;m do glad I went ahead and purchased it! The waver creates beautiful waves. I have hair that is medium thickness and about an inch below my shoulders. I can complete it in about 25 minutes. I have used it about 6 times and have had no hiccups. it does get hot so be careful! if you are on the fence, go for it😃</li>
    <li> I loved this waver, it had a wonderful effect on my hair. After just a few uses, the plastic started to melt so it would not open without force. Now, after 10 months of occasional use, the plastic has completely melted away from the rod rendering it unusable.</li>
    <li> Sturdy well made product, great deal and awesome price!</li>
    <li> Love this, did my whole head in five minutes and I have long thick hair.</li>
    <li> I had to try this the same day I got it. I have thick hair that is straight/wavy and is kind of frizzy-ish on its own. I regularly use a hair straightener if I plan on wearing it down to keep it manageable. I&#x27;ve never had luck with curling my hair; I don&#x27;t have the patience and it doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair anyway, unless a professional does it. I&#x27;ve used my hair straightener on braids, but it&#x27;s impossible to get my whole head of hair this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waver was really easy to use. I could do a lot of hair at one time and only had to hold it in place for 5-10 seconds on each section. It&#x27;s also very easy to move from one section to the next; just slide it down to the next piece of hair. I added a little mousse and hairspray and voila! Done! I texted a friend that I got it around 4:45p and was sending her pics of my hair by 10mins after 5. QUICK! There are a lot of reviews that say it will last through the next day, so I&#x27;m looking forward to see what it looks like tomorrow. With past experience in using a hair straightener on braids, I believe this will hold to be true. Could not be happier with it!</li>
    <li> There has to be better methods of curling hair.  It is heavy, bulky and awkward but it does give your hair curl.</li>
    <li> This works great for quick beachy or loose waves especially for long hair. My hair is on the thin side but it holds really well. It also is very quick to use. I don&#x27;t use it on the highest heat level and a few quick crimps down each group of hair and it is set for the day. I am very happy with this purchase. I definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I read most of the reviews before ordering this, and I must say that they were pretty much all spot on! This waver produces gorgeous beach waves in half the time of those expensive instacurl gadgets! And at a fraction of the cost!! Very easy to use, and lasting waves!</li>
    <li> love the curls this barrel curler makes! they are all aligned well, and orderly if that makes sense!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this waver! It heats up fast and my hair keeps the waves all day (my hair normally doesn&#x27;t hold curl too well)... I have waist length hair and it takes me about 20 minutes to get all my hair done. It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, though your hand will start to cramp after awhile, no biggie though. Otherwise this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This thing barely crimped the hair, you have to hold it on for at least 3 minutes, which is a lot of time when you are only crimping 1 1/2 to 2 inch sections at a time.... Bed Head styling tools have let me down many times, I&#x27;m not sure why I thought this would be any different.....</li>
    <li> This is just taking up space in my bathroom. If you have this hair do not get this product. Ugh</li>
    <li> just got it ... love love love it.. this is somthing i would definitely recommend if u just want a simple look without a lot of work</li>
    <li> The highest heat setting REALLY fries your hair. Be sure to use a lower temperature if you want your hair to be healthy.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this item. I dropped and broke the first one! Whoops! I have medium length, straight, fine, hair and this gives me body waves for up to three days. Of course it also involves using a good amount of hairspray and pomade but I love my hair with this!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder-length hair. I still like this styling tool, but I&#x27;m only able to fit about 2 waves into each section. I think it would work better for longer hair. I&#x27;ll definitely still use this, because it&#x27;s great for adding texture for making a messy up-do. Side note - If you&#x27;re leaving your hair down after using this, you may need to go over the ends with a curling iron as this waver leaves them rather straight (at least it did for me).</li>
    <li> Works awesome! Creates Natural looking waves &amp; holds till you wash your hair! Love it!</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for my 16  yr old granddaughter. She loves it. Received it in 5 days after ordering. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I am not the most skilled person when it comes to styling my hair.  I was hoping this product would be easy for me to use.  I did not find it easy to use.  Probably operator error on my part but I will not be able to use this product.  I would say you need to be adept at using styling tools to use it or have someone else use it on your hair.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to get this Bed Head Deep Waver!! I am really happy with the purchase. Love the waves and body it gives my long hair. It is so much quicker to use the waver in the morning rather than using a curling iron. Once hair is dry, takes me about 10 minutes to do my whole head. My hair is down to the middle of my back and not very thick. Love that it gets SO hot so quickly and there is a tempature control dial. Will post pic soon!&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t give the full 5 stars because it seems like it will not last very long. Today when I was closing it on my last piece of hair, it wouldn&#x27;t close properly and then it snapped shut. Hopefully I can get a few months use out of it. But all in all for the price it is a GREAT waver. Worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this waver! The waves aren&#x27;t too big or too small. It gives a lot of body and unlike many other wavers they actually stay!!</li>
    <li> This waver is super hot, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to make big waves in my hair.  Hair glides through the plates easily without sticking, even when my hair has been hair sprayed.  The size of the waves is bigger, and the waves stay in all day big they are DEEP, like the title says.  My daughter&#x27;s coarse hair and my fine hair both wave easily.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I got this recently and really like the way my hair turns out. I have fairly coarse hair and I can use it on low. If you use small pieces of hair, it turns out looking really wavy, almost like a really loose perm. I got lots of compliments on my hair at work. People couldn&#x27;t figure out how I did it. It stays in pretty good too. The next day, I just touch up any pieces that are looking straight. No big deal. It turns out better if you use holding products before you start ( ie. mousse, hair spray).</li>
    <li> This just proves that you can&#x27;t buy name brand and expect superb quality.  My friend owns a Revlon and her waves look amazing.  My hair is very easy to style and holds curls really well.  I tried this at least 5 different times and I would be lucky if I got one wave out of it.  I put it on the highest setting, and still nothing.  This product is awful and I do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This thing gives me the beautiful waves as if I had my hair in a french braid. Also it lasts for like two days. I just put a small amount of a light hold spray in it and it looks great all day. My hair is usually straight as a pencil and it doesn&#x27;t curl at all! I can curl my hair with a curling iron and 30 minutes later it is straight again. So this was so great that I finally found something that I could use on my hair.</li>
    <li> If you like waves in your hair, but you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time curling it, then you will love this. Its mainly for shoulder length and longer hair. I love this product and it didn&#x27;t take long to do and the waves lasted all day.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing it does exactly what it says...I have really thick hair and I hate curling irons becasue they take too long..this I can do my hair in like 45 mins if i want a beachy wave. if you want beach curls get this product! awesome!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product seems to be what I was looking for.  I haven&#x27;t quite mastered how to use it AND make my hair not look crazy, but thats not the products fault...</li>
    <li> I got the waver within like 2 days of ordering it which was great. My biggest fear with it was that my hair was going to look crimped instead of wavy but I was pleasntly surprised when my hair did look wavy and the next day most of my waves still looked good and all I have to do is a little touch up. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone</li>
    <li> This waver is great. I love the waves it creates, it looks really beachy and fun. The only things I dislike about it is the heating situation. I like being able to see the actual temperature, not just a spinny thing going from hot to cool. Since I am afraid I am going too hot and burning my hair, I keep it on the cooler side, so it takes forever to wave. But I still really like it. If you have got time, get it! The price is a plus, too. As for it lasting, I can&#x27;t say anything because I have only had it a few weeks...but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Having sexy waves is a must have for summer, this styler makes the waves last long and keep my hair full of bounce!</li>
    <li> Far by the best waver I&#x27;ve used. Its consistent and highly reliable! I don&#x27;t have to worry about going out having a bad hair day.</li>
    <li> TERRIFIC WITH  MY LONG HAIR. GIVES ME A WHOLE NEW LOOK. GIVES GREAT VOLUME, SO DON&#x27;T RUN THE PICK THRU YOUR HAIR.</li>
    <li> This curler is amazing.  It creates natural-looking waves that last forever.  When I use a thermal hairspray with this curler, the waves I get survive everything: 40 mph winds, humidity, naps, etc. (With a classic hair curler, my curls barely get through the day.)  This thing also makes your hair look great.  It gives your hair volume without frizz.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments every time I&#x27;ve used it.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but you really have to try twice or more to get the waves that you want, which mean that you going to burn your hair.</li>
    <li> Its easy to use.. Im glad that i bought this product.. The result is very nice! Will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this because I have never used one, but it is pretty awesome! I have really long hair so I think that is why it works good. It gives my hair body and shine. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it smells funny when it is on. But that could be because it is brand new! Other than that it is perfect if you want to do something cute and different in a short amount of time.</li>
