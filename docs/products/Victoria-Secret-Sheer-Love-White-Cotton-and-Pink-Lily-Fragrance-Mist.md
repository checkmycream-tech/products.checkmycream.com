<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> loved this i use it all the time</li>
    <li> I usually dont buy body sprays bc I think they smell, well, cheap. but a coworker was wearing this and I had to find out what it was. It smells very clean and refreshing, yet feminine. I was surprised when she told me what it was. I thought maybe she was wearing a great-smelling hand lotion. But I am very satisfied with this, great for everyday.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell of this. It isn&#x27;t too strong and it last practically all day.  The bottle is huge! bigger than I expected. It&#x27;s great, especially for it&#x27;s price 👍 plus I got compliments for it also ^__</li>
    <li> Truly what they say, cotton/lily. A little more cotton than lily, not quite my scent tho.  Quick shipping</li>
    <li> great product and seller</li>
    <li> Smells great wife loved it</li>
    <li> I was gifted Sheer Love body lotion and fell in love with the scent. I was surprised the body mist is somewhat sweeter than the lotion but it lasts all day when combined together. Great scent for working with elementary students all day!</li>
    <li> I chose this item because I thought it had a delicious smell, I like this product and i recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells great but the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work. It was a gift so I can&#x27;t send it back.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  So glad I could buy it through you. Will re order when I run out again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It is a light fragrance, and one that my teenage granddaughter likes very much, as a matter of fact, her mom loves the scent also. It is usually on her Christmas or her birthday list of her favorite items.&lt;br /&gt;Jackie</li>
    <li> love it....quick delivery as promised</li>

    <li> Thank you very much for the excellent product</li>
    <li> Nice Summer scent for any age.</li>

    <li> I love the sweet and soft scent of this mist spray. :)</li>
    <li> When I ordered this stuff I wasn&#x27;t even looking for this particular mist. My purchasing of it was based solely on the fact that it&#x27;s the only fragrance (for women) on Amazon that I&#x27;ve seen with a rating of 5 full-stars. Honestly not knowing what to expect, I must say that I&#x27;m undoubtedly pleasantly surprised, and satisfied with the scent. My husband was also pleased - so that&#x27;s definitely a plus. My husband said that it smells similar to the &#x27;cucumber melon&#x27; body-wash that I always enjoy using, and I agree. I have no complaints regarding product, it appears just as it is advertised, and the shipping experience was quicker than I expected it to be. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a knock off but I was amazed that it was the actual deal! It smells amazing and i wear practically everyday.</li>
    <li> Was purchased as a gift and the the recipient loves it.</li>
    <li> Marvelous fragrance , fast delivery</li>
    <li> Beautiful Scent :) absolutely love it and it&#x27;s just what i needed!</li>
