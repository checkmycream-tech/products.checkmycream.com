<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The box is too big, not comfortable for carry in bag. There is no brand name printed on the box too. The price is cheap, just unsure on the quality.</li>
    <li> Palette was bigger than I expected it to be. ;)</li>
    <li> Works best when used with moisturizer! I have an oily complexion and did not anticipate the need for a moisturizer however I found the formula very talcy and it does not blend without moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am satisfied with this product and will consider a re- order when I run out. I love the color choices for contouring and find the powder is color build friendly- more than one layer compatable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied- you can&#x27;t ask for much more for the price girls! Check it out!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Came early&lt;br /&gt;Great price&lt;br /&gt;Nice size&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Came broken&lt;br /&gt;Powder all over the packaging&lt;br /&gt;Holes in packaging&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to have this to start contouring but its nearly impossible because the powder is all over the place. I wish it would of been handle better. But it came clear from china.. so I guess its whatever</li>
    <li> It came all crumpled and once I opened the box it spilled everywhere ! (:</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money! Horrible. Doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star</li>
    <li> I was interested in a contouring palette and after reading some amazon reviews, I stumbled upon this one. I figured, what the hell, and ordered it. I love it. I usually only use the two darker shades for contouring, I dont like the light ones for highlighting. I feel like they are too sheer and the color doesn&#x27;t show up on my skin.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this! She gets this for $10 verses the exact same product at Ulta for $40.</li>
    <li> Perfect colors for a contour pallet and a huge size. It is a lot bigger than you would expect it to be. It is a great product that I will recommend and purchase again!</li>
    <li> It came in the mail broken ,palette does&#x60;t close fully so when I opened it it was a mess</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it every day!</li>
    <li> Good deal for the price</li>
    <li> Thought this would be more of a cream based but after reading the description it does clearly say it is POWDER. Even though it isn&#x27;t what I expected, it still goes on very well and gives you a clean finished look.</li>
    <li> Great product... Goes on great, flawless look. Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this!!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I already love it 😍</li>
    <li> I bought this product and was very excited about getting it but when I opened it, it looked like the picture I&#x27;ve attached. I was very disappointed and I am debating if I should render it or not.</li>
    <li> Nice buy for the money.  I had never done highlighting and contouring before, so this was a nice, inexpensive way to play around with both.  The peach color also makes a nice blush.</li>
    <li> I found that this contour palette does work very nicely if you are looking for a light contour. Being as cheap as it is I believe that this was a very good purchase. I did not smell any strange odor like a few reviewers have. Brand new and unused and palette is larger in size so you will definitely be getting your moneys worth. All in all this is a fairly good product, will order again!!</li>
    <li> I ended up sending these back because I didn&#x27;t read the headline obviously that they are actually powder now cream.</li>
    <li> Was for my daughter so far no complaints she seems to love it</li>
    <li> great product blendable!!</li>
    <li> Packaging was not good. It was cracked and had powder all over the place. But too cheap and not worth sending back. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Does the job at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Italian and have light and olive-y color to my skin...i love the color selection. i use the wh for highlighter or to make my face white for Halloween makeup it works very well and it turns me white white without coming off, any who the other two lighter color next to it in the photo i combine those two to go over my foundation for powder it works great to even me out and make the liquid foundation smooth, the bottom left color is actually a light green i use under my eyelids for dark circles, the one next to it is a very light pink i use this for corrections and under all pink shades for a nice base and blush. the darkest one is slightly lighter then the photo and i use it as my contouring powder and it build up perfectly so its not uber dark on first application....its just an amazing palette i use it everyday now work work and atleast sat lol so its been 3mos and it doesn&#x27;t look like i even  used it...will def buy it once im out</li>
    <li> Works great and the browns work well for eyeshadow as well</li>
    <li> I really liked this product for the price! I didn&#x27;t expect it to be high-end quality. Surprisingly, product is not powdery or chalky but not extremely pigmented. It&#x27;s decent for an everyday natural contour :) So unfortunately this palette wouldn&#x27;t work for medium-deep skin tones. Has a bit of a scent, but i don&#x27;t mind it! Overall, great for beginners, perfect for a light/natural contour. I really loved that the product  arrived really fast! wasn&#x27;t damaged or touched!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Love this product. I&#x27;ve been spending $48 on the it cosmetics contour pallette and I like this one so much more!</li>
    <li> Love them i use them daily</li>
    <li> Very nice, nice colors . Looks good .</li>
    <li> It may be my own fault but it&#x27; doesn&#x27;t really work the way I thought it would. Someone more experienced may have better luck. Tried it before my enagagement pictures and didn&#x27;t like the outcome so I didn&#x27;t end up using it. But again it might be my own fault.</li>
    <li> Okay for the price... Doesn&#x27;t stay very long.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this I was under the impression that it was a cream palette... The palette I recieved is powder, however I do like the colors and am interested in seeing if I can still blend these colors with a brush instead of a sponge as I had planned..</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I received it within two days of ordering. The pictures do not do it justice. The pallet is big and the compressed powders work well with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Good for basic contouring</li>
    <li> Came home from vacation, opened my package &amp; its broken :(</li>
    <li> The palette is great for a beginner! The quality is great. Im did not get a bad odor from the poweder that some reviewers were taling about. The packaging was great and i received in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> White powder arrived broken</li>
    <li> Love this pallete!!!! It&#x27;s bigger than I thought it would be. A little bigger than 5×7. Good price. Does the job for me!!!!</li>
    <li> Applied unevenly on my skin, it didn&#x27;t blend easily either.</li>
    <li> Great was delivered in 4 days very creamy for powder</li>
    <li> If you are looking for the heavy contour look, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. However, if you, like myself, aren&#x27;t looking to drastically apply your makeup, but still achieve some gentle shaping to your face, this product works really well. If you are afraid of chemicals, then I would do more research because it does have a funny smell (but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around). I really don&#x27;t know what causes the smell, but it seems to be a chemical smell (I am by no means an expert though). However, it didn&#x27;t cause a reaction or acne. Mainly, know what you&#x27;re looking for. This won&#x27;t completely alter the look of your face structure, but it does an excellent job of providing more natural-looking contouring. Great for beginners like myself.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in perfect condition and is perfect for different cosmetics needs! Love it! Easy to take with me on photo shoots or movie sets!</li>
    <li> great for highlighting and contouring they&#x27;re not chalky at all. They came on time.  Not one came broken. So far I&#x27;m satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> Works really well just like the YouTube tutorials I watch.</li>
    <li> I received my order,  and am very disappointed because I came broken, who are&#x27;t responsible for this but it is not what I expected &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  As others have said. it isn&#x27;t very pigmented.  I have to use a ton and it isn&#x27;t easy for me to blend.</li>
    <li> These are very chalky.</li>
    <li> Professional 6 Colors Contour Face Powder Makeup Blush Palette&lt;br /&gt;I like this palette. I purchased this to use for contouring and they work for that purpose. These are powders. They are not extremely pigmented, but work for me since a little bit of contouring can go way too far sometimes (I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen the ladies with slashes of brown or red blush on their cheeks- yikes!). I am very fair, but I can even use the darker colors since they do not transfer a ton of pigment to my brushes. The white color is nice for hi lighting. This powder is not top of the line, but it certainly works for me. I recommend this palette.</li>
    <li> Love this palette!! Make sure you have a blender sponge!!</li>
    <li> This product arrived broken and powder every where.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the colors thou.</li>
    <li> Great for shading.  Not messy or flaky.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product came three days late in the mail and then when I finally got it it was completely destroyed and the tins were broken and falling out of the container!</li>
    <li> It was easy to use and it went on well</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love this contour kit. I think it is a good first one to try if you don&#x27;t have much experience with contouring.</li>
    <li> Powdery, not pigmented. Get one of these from a trusted brand. I have since learned these knock offs from china can and will have dangerous ingredients for your health, so I stopped using. It was not as build able as it needed to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this palette for the last few months pretty much daily. It&#x27;s probably got 3 more shades than are really needed for my style of contouring. But I&#x27;m a newbie. I wanted something cheap that I could play with and learn how to contour softly. I use the darkest one, the white one, and depending on how much sun I got one of the two lighter shades. Rarely do I use the pink one. But they go on smoothly, they&#x27;re buildable and they blend well. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to since this was my first experience with contour powders.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  Never used Contour Face Powder before.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> So I was looking for a cheap dupe for Anastasia Beverly Hills Contour kit and came along this little gem on Amazon. I read the reviews and the only complaint I had seen was that it came broken but I have never had a problem getting a refund on Amazon for broken products. So I bought it. And I am so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I have Amazon prime so I got the fast two-day shipping with my order. It got here just when it said it would and not even broken so already a big plus. And the pans are so big, I don&#x27;t know how I will use them all up.&lt;br /&gt;Then I swatches the colors.... and so creamy its amazing. They are a slight caulky but totally worth less then $10 I paid for it! They have a great color payoff and easy to blend and work with. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I bought this palette because I am just getting into contouring and I wanted to try it out a little bit before spending a ton of money on the Anastasia one which is like $40 I think. I think that it works well enough, although I am no makeup artist.  I think it is good for practicing though! I am fair skinned and I wear a 115 in Make up forever HD foundation, although I think I have more &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; undertones than pink. I use the two lightest colors for highlighting, the two middle colors are kind of peachy and I use them as blush sometimes, and then use the two dark colors as contour colors. I am pretty happy with it although next time I buy a contour kit I might look for a cream kit instead of powder as I just think I sometimes end up looking too powdery.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t quite mastered the technique at using this yet, however one day i was crying, LOL, and then i get a message that someone was coming over so i quickly ran upstairs and was successfully able to cover any red ness or puffy ness with the lighter shades bleaching out the red!! it isnt as pigmented as it probably should be, but i cant really complain yet!</li>
    <li> I really like this product I use it for contouring my nose and face. The only bad thing is it took a really long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> I watched a few Youtube tutorials on contouring makeup then ordered this palette to try. Maybe its just me, but its hard to blend and has a thick feel once its on. Of course, I typically don&#x27;t wear foundation or powder so it may seem extra heavy to me.</li>
    <li> It has a smell. An unignorable smell. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m reacting to the powder or to summer+powder, but I did break out a little after wearing it. Colors are pretty warm, which is not ideal for my skin tone. I&#x27;ll keep it around for special occasions when I bother to contour or until I can plop down some money for a better palette but it is what it is.</li>
    <li> Product was all crumbled up and in total disarray. I was very disappointed to say the least. Have not received any product in so poor condition.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. It works great for my contouring</li>
    <li> They came shattered. Really disappointed</li>
    <li> It was everywhere, covered my other items that I had ordered</li>
    <li> This is really an awesome deal.. The bronzer is the perfect color and is well pigmented suprisingly for such a low price is so well made and pretty big too. It&#x27;s a lot bigger than this pic looks</li>
    <li> The pans are big and the colors are all very pigmented. This is a great contour palette for beginners. :)</li>
    <li> Whether you&#x27;re new to the world or contouring or simply need a spare palette on deck this is a GREAT choice, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived well packaged and all the colors were intact. I have fairly sensitive skin and this palette has never irritated my skin in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the wait since it ships from China.</li>
    <li> Just got this a day earlier than expected and I&#x27;m so pleased! The palette is actually HUGE, I was expecting them to be smaller pans. The pigments are great and the shades are great for my skintone- although I don&#x27;t think this would work well for darker skin.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged well and it&#x27;s extremely durable for the price.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself smells like a new pair of shoes, but since I like that smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Slightly damaged because of shipping. But overall a very beautiful and affordable palate. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> the product is okay. it works if you use a ton. but it&#x27;s not very pigmented.</li>
    <li> Works well for beginner contouring.</li>
    <li> I love this pallette.  It goes on great and stays on.  The colors are great too.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but they look great and have that great good quality makeup smel. Mine did arrive busted and that was disappointing</li>
    <li> (Wife of a Timothy)...This powder does not stick well to brushes or skin even when used with good primer and expensive brushes. Does not blend well either. It took many layers of the powder in each spot to get the results I was looking for. (Highlight and Contour) This next thing may not happen to anyone else but I got a nasty infection in my right eye the next day and I am very sure it was from the powder. My eye was burning immediately after I used the powder that was flying all over because it would not stick to the brush. Some if it got in my eye . I washed it out well and had a pink eye like infection the next morning. I would not recommend. I should have listened to previous reviews not to try. Also has a strange unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> As a cosmetologist, I&#x27;m broke so I bought something cheap. Also as a hairstylist who is trained in hair skin and nails, I love this product. I have such sensitive skin it&#x27;s ridiculous. But I have had absolutely no problems with this product. its easy to apply, and even though I have excessively oily skin it stays on all day!</li>
    <li> While reading the review I was scared that there would come home broken like others but mine came just fine! The colors are great and you get what you paid for. Overall I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I really love this I just got it tonight and the colors are gorgeous and shows up so pretty!!! Very good product. I would totally recommend others to purchase it. Absolutely gorgeous colors.</li>
    <li> This set is actually very big and is perfect for light/fair skin. Everything is matte so shimmer will not draw attention to fine lines or wrinkles. Great color selection for daytime use for those who are afraid of the contrast of regular contouring! Only 4 stars as the powder is light and doesn&#x27;t stick to brush well but blends wonderful on skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice palette for the price. These are powders but would also recommend buying some creams, which is what Im looking into for a more defined contour. Very pigmented and definitely do last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Like the slim alternative to travel with to many&lt;br /&gt;pressed powder compacts.</li>
    <li> So like everybody else, mine came with a broken palette. But there&#x27;s a way to fix it. There are many youtube videos on how to do this, but basically all you have to do is crush up the bits to a fine powder in a ziplock bag, put the powder back in the pan, and stir to a paste with rubbing alcohol. Let dry overnight and it&#x27;s good as new. Photos I&#x27;ve added are the after shots--the broken one was the top middle.</li>
    <li> Not the best shade for me</li>
    <li> I love these pallets! They are a life saver. They have highlighting and contouring powders along with your regular face powder. It&#x27;s super easy for me to travel with , so I don&#x27;t bring a bunch of different pallets and they seem to last forever, and trust me I use it everyday. Definitely my go to.</li>
    <li> The best and cheapest contour powder palate</li>
    <li> I just got my palette today and I love it! The colors are amazing for my pale skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I thought will be smaller box, but this box with 6 colors is very big. Love it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a contour palette and I will never go back!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to contouring but I must say I&#x27;ll forever do this. This pallet works well but my only complaint is I like the dewy look and the white colors don&#x27;t really do anything for me. So I use a shimmering bonne bell or elf blush and go instead.</li>
    <li> It works well. It&#x27;s light weight but wearable</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Works great!</li>
    <li> Great palette, and I like that there is not shimmer to it. I wish it had  mirror in the lid, but I&#x27;m satisfied for what I received!</li>
    <li> Value of this is amazing. Don&#x27;t bother with expensive versions!</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t a high quality palette.  While it was more than what I expected in terms of the size, it was very chalky.  I have light/medium skin and I had to use a lot of product to just barely see it on my face.  I even tried to use it with different brushes for technique purposes and it just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.  I did however use it for my daughter&#x27;s zombie look for Halloween. It did work well in conjunction with other makeup for that look.</li>
    <li> I love this palette and I love the pigment, it&#x27;s perfect for me and I use it everyday. Great for olive skin tones or even fair, you can mix them your brush and get a custom color!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately when I received this item, the top row third compact was broken :((( I wish they were more careful with that. And this is my only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 :/&lt;br /&gt;Overall, love the product!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am actually almost finished with it, the reason I gave it 3 stars instead of the 5 it deserves because when it arrived 2 of the colors were broken and then very soon after (next day I believe) one of the other colors broke too. The only colors I am left with are the ones that I cant live without! The tan color, the brown, the 2nd to the lightest skin tone and the bottom left pinker skin tone. The colors fit my skin color well and they blend even better.</li>
    <li> Just recieved my pallet of broken make up!</li>
    <li> Recieved damaged. The blush was completely busted and all over the place. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually tried it just yet but I got to say this is a lot bigger than I thought it would be the pictures make it look like it&#x27;s small like an eyeshadow kit but this thing is like a good 8 inches long and there is a lot of color for the price. I&#x27;m happy with it so far. I&#x27;m going to play around with it tonight to see how it contours and highlight.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I am super pail skinned and this works for me!&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was for the very medicine type smell!</li>
    <li> No pigmentation at all. Regret buying this!</li>
    <li> the colors are basically the same. i think i got a old palate</li>
    <li> This palette is a lot bigger than I expected it to be, as in it&#x27;s the size of my makeup bag almost. That&#x27;s the only reason for the lower star really. Otherwise, this palette is great for it&#x27;s price! I&#x27;m fair skinned and the shades match well.</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought. Love this pallet</li>
    <li> The pallet is HUGE. And I&#x27;m glad it was so cheap because I didn&#x27;t want to spend tons of money on a high end pallet when I&#x27;m just starting out contouring and stuff. but of course one of the colors was broken...... :(</li>
    <li> I liked but the only problem is that one of them come broken</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s color suck they dont color nice. when reseved the white and beige color were broken what a mess!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Shipped quickly and without any damage.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving them one star because I received the item damaged</li>
    <li> i use this every day. though, to be honest, i only really use the white and brown for contouring and the other colours seem a little superfluous unless you happen to be that exact skintone.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Had to order twice and both times all colors were broken. Cheap shipping packaging. Will never order again.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with this product for the price.  The makeup does not hold as well as I expected, but it is worth it for the money.</li>
    <li> Shipping to forever and a day but it was well worth it for sure!</li>
    <li> The product isnt very good. Feels like kids make up</li>
    <li> Use it everyday all day! Great for contouring.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for...cheap, blend-able setting powder for contouring.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product. My only gripe is that it came with no instructions whatsoever. I understand that in todays world, I can go on youtube to find a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; for a contour palette. Even still, I would much prefer a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; to be included with a palette so that it would be easier on my part.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beginner with makeup so this really helped me. It&#x27;s not expensive so don&#x27;t expect it to be great, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you&#x27;re just starting.</li>
    <li> Thanks I got this :) and I am happy with it</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great contour palette.  I have only used the yellow setting powder but loom forward to doing some major contouring for the 8 weddings I will be attending in the upcoming months. The products are high quality and the bronzer/contouring colors are pigmented and blend nicely.</li>
    <li> These are alright, they come exactly how they look. Big size which is nice, I am a licensed cosmetologist, these are not high end formula powders but they work their worth. Also, my palettes popped out in my second use.. cheap!</li>
    <li> This makeup stays on better than any powder I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin feel greasy or break out.  Really great product.  I have kept this a part of my makeup routine since the first day I used it.</li>
    <li> :{ not what i expected at all.</li>
    <li> Great for the money. Shipping was super slow.</li>
    <li> This product is great for lighter skin .. Not a high end formula, but it&#x27;s a pretty good product for the price.</li>
    <li> My daughter is in love with it. Want e to order another.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have about this product is there are no clear instructions, you can watch a video at the companys&#x27; website but I do not apply my makeup at my computer</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend well and makes me look chalky.</li>
    <li> came intact, packaging was good. colours not as much pigmented darkest brown is a light brown so basic contouring not dramatic.</li>
    <li> It took about 1 week to be received.  It came in one piece and unbroken! The packaging was ok, could have used more bubble wrap in case careless handlers/delivery person is careless and tosses it around.  There were a few powder pieces but that&#x27;s expected because pressed powder does tend to get everywhere.  I love palettes and this is definitely what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  It is a good size palette.  The colors are nice, the darkest powder isn&#x27;t as dark as I would have liked it to be.  Then again I have an olive complexion.  I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Works well, but not very high quality.</li>
    <li> My daughter had fun mixing &amp; matching with this.</li>
    <li> Came broken. But for the money good for a beginner learner about contouring.</li>
    <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy when applying, colour are great too</li>
    <li> Definitely a &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34; if you love make up and want to get into the contouring craze. This is just what I was looking for. It comes with 6 shades of powder, 3 that can be used for highlighting and 3 for contouring. My make up looks very polished every time I use this palette. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Use it daily!  Love it</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for a friend, came on time and they loved it. :)</li>
    <li> Good quality makeup but the palate came all crushed. I brushed my finger over some of the colors but it was just too messy.</li>
    <li> PRETTY GOOD... DIDNT LIKE THE FACT THAT IS POWDER.. OTHER THAN THAT GOOD</li>
    <li> I use these as face powder, contour powder, blush &amp; eye shadow. Use a good brush &amp; you won&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> When I saw the price, I had to try it and I was shocked to see how good this actually was! Great for contouring! Will buy from again!</li>
    <li> The size is great, really big, it makes you don&#x27;t use your own powders to make countours, the size is about 5cm of diameter each ball or more, I didn&#x27;t mesure it, but it&#x27;s REALLY big. BUT..... the smell is awfull. Ok, you can ignore it. But it smells just as that colorfull mushy things that little kids uses to modelate. The smell is THE SAME as this [...]</li>
    <li> Mine came broken beyond repair pretty much but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice for the price.</li>
    <li> love love love !! way bigger than i imagined, but great pigment! (ten stars)</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife she says these are powder as they say. They&#x27;re very pigmented and she loves them.</li>
    <li> The powder is very light and doesn&#x27;t stay for very long.</li>
    <li> The swatches are huge and i love using my kit, and it is light as a feather even when i use a lot of makeup.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent price, and the colors are perfect!  I was actually surprised because it was so inexpensive, but it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> It works for me and I have pretty fair skin.</li>
    <li> These are good. I get compliments. Those who complain about the palet, do not know how to contour. It&#x27;s not meant to cover anything. This is a contour set. Put the colors in the right place and blend.</li>
    <li> So disappointed. Really nice tablet but this is how I received it. Completely unacceptable.</li>
    <li> My daughters took a make up class and this was the face powder the instructor suggested.  They are very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> While it arrived in one piece, I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of the product! YUCK it&#x27;s like a very strong smell that reminds me of my gramma - sorry but in this day and age of chemical sensitive skin and noses, why on earth would they want their facial makeup to smell so strong? I tried to use it but had to remove it because of the smell - it just was overpowering - I simply could not imagine why anybody would want to smell this ALL day wafting from their faces!</li>
    <li> Powders are not too pigmented.  Therefore, you need to use a tremendous amount to get coverage.  I would not repurchase this item.  There are other products out there where you use less product and get great coverage.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin but this set made my skin breakout I have never had bad skin and this makeup made my skin get real bumpy and itchy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a MUA in training I love the pallet however it&#x27;s kind of chalky I use it as a setter over cream but all in all it does the job.</li>
    <li> Great set of high and low lights!  A must!</li>
    <li> I loved it!!  It is more then worth the price.  I would buy again and I defiantly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> love this contour kit and is great as a finish. I really only use the white/banana colors to highlight. The palate is large and does not have a mirror.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for contouring, but you really have to have the right brushes for it and have to have lots of practice with it . I also just use it as powder make up. And also came in great condition.</li>
    <li> Arrived smashed to bits. I didn&#x27;t even get to try it.</li>
    <li> I love this. It&#x27;s great for highlight and contouring. The colors work very well on my skin, I&#x27;m a medium skin shade. All the colors are a matte finish, the pans are big. Love it works great.</li>
    <li> Amazing pallet&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist &amp; I use this on everyone of my clients from fair to dark skin.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will be ordering a few more&lt;br /&gt;2-3 for back ups.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product and time of arrival. I am upset however that when the pallet arrived, one of the colors was shttered into pieces.</li>
    <li> Love this Product. I did get it broken though.  Only one color</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised. Shipping time was accurate.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I purchased because of the great price and product ended up being just as wonderful in quality as it is price!</li>
    <li> These worked great for me :) it doesn&#x27;t go on too cakey, and the colors went with my tone beautifully. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but its not to bothersome.</li>
    <li> never disappointed one color was broken but great pallet</li>
    <li> I really like the face powder, its light and doesn&#x27;t look too heavy as some powders do, making it it have a more natural look. The colour palettes are large, and I am sure will last a good while. Only negative thing I have to say is that one of the colour palette was shattered when I revived it.</li>
    <li> good product for the price. Be aware that these do have a fragrance...not horrible but very perfumey.</li>
</ol>
