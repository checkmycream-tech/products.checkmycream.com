<ol>
      <li>Great Buy!</li>
      <li>Perfect for those nights when your baby is all clogged up.</li>
      <li>It is great!</li>
      <li>An excellent inhalor.</li>
      <li>Excellent for allergy sufferers as well as cold/flu sufferers.  </li>
      <li>Kaz is an excellent brand, but this doesn&#x27;t smell very good for an inhalant.</li>
      <li>Vicks makes very good products</li>
      <li>perfect and great price</li>
      <li>Loved it!</li>
      <li>Works great even with the mini handheld</li>
      <li>This is a great supplement to the pads that I have used.  </li>
      <li>great for humidifiers</li>
      <li>works amazingly!</li>
      <li>But I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works good in the vick&#x27;s humidifier but costs a lot.</li>
      <li>Just as good as Vicks for a fraction of the price.  </li>
      <li>Seems good, just used it once and will</li>
      <li>And It Didn&#x27;t Work As Good.</li>
      <li>This may work for some units but it is one of those the price is to good to truly be a good product.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff.  </li>
      <li>Good for removing congestion</li>
      <li>Good size for use with Steam Inhalers.</li>
      <li>Very good price and as an add on, easy to order and have shipped.</li>
      <li>I am sure it&#x27;s a great product but not for use in the steam humidifier.</li>
      <li>sure the product its great</li>
      <li>If you prefer a very potent vapor, recommend the pre-soaked pads that companies make.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m completely satisfied by the product!</li>
      <li>As nice as this product is, and it is, I would almost suggest to just by the extract (also sold on Amazon).</li>
      <li>vapors are good, just seems they aren&#x27;t as potent as the Vicks Vaposteam</li>
      <li>Got this because it&#x27;s recommended by Vicks and we use a Vicks Warm Mist humidifier in my daughter&#x27;s room.  </li>
      <li>Doesnt work with &amp;#34;Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier with Auto Shut-Off&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I ordered this item because it was recommended with my Vick&#x27;s Warm Steam humidifier.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as noticeable as the Vicks warm mist I used.  </li>
      <li>Got this to use in our two Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier with Auto Shut-Off.</li>
      <li>I am sure this would be a good product, but the vaporizer was returned, so this was too.</li>
      <li>got this and the Vicks inhalants along with the Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier With Auto Shut-Off.</li>
      <li>It smells great when you walk in (if you like that menthol thing), but you get used to it quickly.</li>
      <li>This was not as strong but still worked fairly well.</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong odor.  </li>
      <li>You should remove the cup holder of the humidifier before adding them, otherwise, it is very easy to spill and get it in with the water.</li>
      <li>Used with the Vicks Warm mist humidfier with the cup at the top of the unit.</li>
      <li>Vick&#x27;s VapoRub is much more effective for me, so I&#x27;ll just stick with that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is as good as the original.</li>
      <li>Love it, It clears me out when I am not feeling the greatest, even helps my 3 month old son.</li>
      <li>It lasts all night on medium setting and my bedroom has a very comfortable, humid feel in the morning.</li>
      <li>Nice strong inhalant.  </li>
      <li>Good product... does not seem to be a strong as original Vicks.</li>
      <li>Excellent price same as you buy at store name brand for $8</li>
      <li>You will get much more for your money.</li>
      <li>I used the Vicks &amp; it worked much better.</li>
      <li>I had more luck with Vapor rub.</li>
      <li>We found this to be just OK.</li>
      <li>I will not be getting any more of this.</li>
      <li>I love this product as it helps me sleep better.</li>
      <li>Good in theory, but I think this needs a much hotter steam to be effective.</li>
      <li>Helps me sleep much better at night.</li>
      <li>Was easy to use and helped  my throat and nasal passages feel better.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and will buy again.</li>
      <li>The vapors are not as strong as compared with Vick&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Product works fine in the Humidifer</li>
      <li>Works well with the Vicks dehumidifier, no strange smells, great product</li>
      <li>Works ok but has too much oil in it the Vicks evaporated and was much more aromatic this one leaves oil after evaporation , it&#x27;s not as strong as I like</li>
      <li>snow filled streets.</li>
      <li>Puts a nice gentle scent in the air and helps keep my nose and my mouth moistened.  </li>
      <li>Mild aroma, easy to miss when used alone.</li>
      <li>To oily it ,coats everything and is a pain to clean off</li>
      <li>I found that this didn&#x27;t really evaporate from the top of my vaporizer, it just sat there.</li>
      <li>It is oily, so it didn&#x27;t evaporate, and the cup was still full.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really been sleeping better as well.</li>
      <li>So it is not bad.</li>
      <li>She use to get super congested in her sleep and even during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>The humidifier produces very hot steam that is sufficient to activate it, yet it still does not produce any scented vapors.</li>
      <li>Easy to fill and performs very well.</li>
      <li>The pout of the bottle is not user friendly for pouring into the container of the humidifier, so be ready for spills and runs everytime!</li>
      <li>This product works well in the machine and the scent is suddle not over powerful, the babies sleep so calmly when it on.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell if it helped much, but it was the only good thing I could smell.</li>
      <li>Doesnt smell good like other Vicks Vapor products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is affordable though, right on the budget.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Now, I use pure eucalyptus oil for the pad in the Vick and in my cool mist humidifier.</li>
      <li>The Vicks inhalant works much better, and most of it evaporates from the little medicine cup of the humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
      <li>I had recently tried the Vicks vapor product that was mixed into the water which was great.</li>
      <li>It makes them last longer and helps with breathing especially with sore throats from the smoke we have had this year from the fires, great stuff.</li>
      <li>or if you are sensitive to strong odors.</li>
      <li>Works well and 4 oz is more than enough!</li>
      <li>first time buying the product for the Vic&#x27;s vaporizer and it works well.</li>
      <li>Has a funny smell.</li>
      <li>; it needs HOT steam to mix into</li>
      <li>The spirits in the mineral oil just wear out too quickly, then you&#x27;re left with an oil puddle in the medicine cup to clean out.</li>
      <li>We use this in our vaporizer in our mountain home where the air is very dry (especially when heat is on) and it is much more effective than just steam for keeping sinus cavities clear.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and lasting scent helps with stuffy sinuses.</li>
      <li>In our opinion the rub emits a much stronger menthol aroma.</li>
      <li>With one girl and another one in the way it is really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>but I really can&#x27;t say I felt a difference in my breathing or the air quality between running the humidifier with or without the inhalant.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t  know how it really works.</li>
      <li>Very Well.</li>
      <li>Vapor Steam from CVS is the real McCoy.</li>
      <li>I was shocked at just how good it worked with my Vicks warm mist humidifier.</li>
      <li>It smells nice for a few minutes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually easy to pull out the inhalant bowl out, but if you spill it, it&#x27;s mineral oil which spreads quickly and makes a mess.</li>
      <li>This was better than expected!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not work as well for my family</li>
    <li> Does the job.. on low it made the whole room reek of it..  so id say it works.. my room is 16x22</li>
    <li> To oily it ,coats everything and is a pain to clean off</li>
    <li> Since I have chronic sinusitis this is one of the few products that helps with my headaches.  Local drug stores just shook their heads and told us the liquid just was not produced any longer.  What a relief to find Amazon carried Kaz.</li>
    <li> horrible greasy oily product that does not give off much smell at all. i do not recommend this at all</li>
    <li> Good product... does not seem to be a strong as original Vicks.</li>
    <li> Works good in the vick&#x27;s humidifier but costs a lot.</li>
    <li> Works well in my steam inhaler to help with sinus or upper respiratory ailments.  Was easy to use and helped  my throat and nasal passages feel better.</li>
    <li> perfect and great price</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is</li>
    <li> Thank you! It is great!</li>
    <li> Smells great out of bottle but unfortunately the humidifier that sold this as a recommendation does not work at all. Don&#x27;t  know how it really works. Stuck with 3 bottles. Hoping to figure a way to use it. Any ideas????</li>
    <li> Got this to use in our two Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier with Auto Shut-Off. Has helped us all a ton! Will be buying again, but it will be a while since it seems to last sooo long!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my stuffy baby. She use to get super congested in her sleep and even during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I use this with her humidifier its almost a guarantee that it decongest her and makes her comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $2.50 a bottle I stocked up with 4. Enough to last through the winter. One bottle for me lasts about only a month, using it everyday.</li>
    <li> Vicks makes very good products</li>
    <li> Careful when buying this. It does NOT evaporate in a similar fashion to the more expensive Vicks product. I thought I was saving a few bucks but I ended up having to buy the more expensive stuff anyway. After filling up the reservoir, it does just sits there. I am sure it&#x27;s a great product but not for use in the steam humidifier.</li>
    <li> Works well and 4 oz is more than enough!</li>
    <li> Product works fine in the Humidifer</li>
    <li> I was excited when I found this item on Amazon as I had previously bought all of the ingredients to make it myself.  This inhalant is such a life saver during a dry winter and bronchitis.  Delivery was somewhat slow for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my parent after she was released from hospital for copd and chest infection.  Prior to using this in her vicks vaporizer, she was unable to sleep because the air was so dry she coughed all night.  My parent said she put this into the vaporizer and closed the door for about 35 minutes.  When she returned to her bed, she could smell the vapors in the air, not overwhelming, and was able to sleep for the first time without cough in 4 days.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This product did not help with my congestion. I used it for several nights with no relief at all. I used the Vicks &amp; it worked much better.</li>
    <li> Works great even with the mini handheld</li>
    <li> The scent is perfect nice eucalyptus, but it is way too diluted: too much base oil, too little eucalyptus. Have not tried other brands, so I cannot compare.</li>
    <li> Used the inhalant in the humidifier and it sat there. Didn&#x27;t evaperate</li>
    <li> The pout of the bottle is not user friendly for pouring into the container of the humidifier, so be ready for spills and runs everytime! And the effect is very transient and disappears in half hour or so. Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This inhalant is, unfortunately, not effective at all. It produces a very faint scent that disappears almost immediately. Most of it will remain in the little cup, even after about 10 hours when I was cleaning the humidifier. The humidifier produces very hot steam that is sufficient to activate it, yet it still does not produce any scented vapors. I even tries to mix it with water and heat it until it boiled. The effect was very weak and you can only feel it if you get very close to the steam.&lt;br /&gt;I got this and the Vicks inhalants along with the Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier With Auto Shut-Off. The Vicks inhalant works much better, and most of it evaporates from the little medicine cup of the humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;Both, this, and the Vicks inhalant are messy. You should remove the cup holder of the humidifier before adding them, otherwise, it is very easy to spill and get it in with the water.</li>
    <li> I am sure this would be a good product, but the vaporizer was returned, so this was too. Not needed or as expected.</li>
    <li> I found that this didn&#x27;t really evaporate from the top of my vaporizer, it just sat there. If you prefer a very potent vapor, recommend the pre-soaked pads that companies make.</li>
    <li> this works well for congestion and have used it for years it has arrived as expected when expected was glad to find it off season</li>
    <li> Product is just ok.&lt;br /&gt;It is affordable though, right on the budget.&lt;br /&gt;But it is not that potent, scent is not strong enough.</li>
    <li> This is a great supplement to the pads that I have used.  But it is something that you don&#x27;t travel with so the pads fulfill that need.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t even tell that this stuff is in the humidifier.</li>
    <li> first time buying the product for the Vic&#x27;s vaporizer and it works well. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is that the oil is left behind in the vaporizer cup. I thought it evaporated.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and lasting scent helps with stuffy sinuses.</li>
    <li> Has multi-use as far as I&#x27;m concerned and costs less than a regular jar of Vicks Vapo Rub. I still use.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time in the vaporizer versus the mentholated rub we typically use. We found this to be just OK. In our opinion the rub emits a much stronger menthol aroma.</li>
    <li> I Used Vicks In My Cold Water Humidifer And It Worked Very Well. I Bought This To Be A Little Bit Cheaper And It Didn&#x27;t Work As Good.</li>
    <li> I use Kaz Inhalant instead of joint rub and warm up then cover certain vulnerable to cold areas before&lt;br /&gt;braving snow filled streets.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with my Essential oils in my Vicks Hot Humidifier.  It makes them last longer and helps with breathing especially with sore throats from the smoke we have had this year from the fires, great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in my vicks vaporizer and seems to work well</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it contains but NO more stuffy nose in the morning. I love this product as it helps me sleep better.</li>
    <li> this is added to the little well in front of the vaporizer. But is not strong enough and the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
    <li> Mild aroma, easy to miss when used alone. However this  works well when you add other essential oils (lavender or eucalyptus)  into the reservoir. I don&#x27;t think it would be very helpful without additional oils or other stronger smelling inhalant.</li>
    <li> Not what I anticipated.</li>
    <li> This product works well in the machine and the scent is suddle not over powerful, the babies sleep so calmly when it on.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful.  It doesn&#x27;t smell at all when you use it.  Pay the extra money and get the real thing.</li>
    <li> The vapors are not as strong as compared with Vick&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Hardly any smell to it</li>
    <li> Good size for use with Steam Inhalers. Very good price and as an add on, easy to order and have shipped.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work with &amp;#34;Vicks Warm Mist Humidifier with Auto Shut-Off&amp;#34; it needs HOT steam to mix into air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;im sure the product its great but this was a buy suggestion &amp; now i got 3 usless bottles &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was just expecting a stronger vapor from this or what but it did not seem to make a difference when I put it in my vaporizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually i would find a strong menthol vapor that would instantly help but this was so minor that I barely noticed it.</li>
    <li> vapors are good, just seems they aren&#x27;t as potent as the Vicks Vaposteam liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m completely satisfied by the product!</li>
    <li> I will not be getting any more of this. I had more luck with Vapor rub. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  Relaxes you just smelling it.  Reminds me of when I got sick as a kid and my mom took care of me.</li>
    <li> Kaz is an excellent brand, but this doesn&#x27;t smell very good for an inhalant.</li>
    <li> Puts a nice gentle scent in the air and helps keep my nose and my mouth moistened.  Seems to remove the stale air very well.</li>
    <li> Easy to fill and performs very well. It lasts all night on medium setting and my bedroom has a very comfortable, humid feel in the morning. I live in a arid, desert area. It helps a lot with my dry mouth and nasal condition. The steam goes straight up in the air and a small circulating fan might help to even out the moisture in a room.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to try when I was sick. I had recently tried the Vicks vapor product that was mixed into the water which was great. This was not as strong but still worked fairly well.</li>
    <li> Seems good, just used it once and will</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because it was recommended with my Vick&#x27;s Warm Steam humidifier.  The first time I used it I could faintly smell the menthol in the room (small bedroom), but the next night nothing.  It is oily, so it didn&#x27;t evaporate, and the cup was still full.  I emptied the cup and refilled it and again nothing.  Good in theory, but I think this needs a much hotter steam to be effective.</li>
    <li> I had my reservations ordering this. I usually only use the Vicks Brand. But I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;It is as good as the original. I could not tell them apart. Plus it is cheaper. Great Buy!</li>
    <li> MAAKES ONE FEEL LIKE HOME,WHEN MOM OR GRANDMA WOULD RUB VICKS ON MY CHEST ONLY WITHOUT THE &amp;#34;GOOEY&amp;#34; FEELING OR SKIN IRRITATION</li>
    <li> I could barely smell or feel any effects from this humidifier inhalant. Vick&#x27;s VapoRub is much more effective for me, so I&#x27;ll just stick with that.</li>
    <li> Excellent for allergy sufferers as well as cold/flu sufferers.  Helps to clear sinuses and nasal passages.  Easy to use and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my new humidifier, so far it&#x27;s really helping with that nasty cough &amp; stuffy head. I&#x27;ve really been sleeping better as well.</li>
    <li> I notice nothing different when I don&#x27;t use this product than when I do. No difference. I don&#x27;t even understand what its purpose is anymore.</li>
    <li> Worked well with our 3 month old that was getting a stuffy nose this passed winter. We used it with our Vicks Humidifier ..</li>
    <li> So it is not bad. I was shocked at just how good it worked with my Vicks warm mist humidifier. I pored it into the reservoir and everything worked as expected. Now, I use pure eucalyptus oil for the pad in the Vick and in my cool mist humidifier. As nice as this product is, and it is, I would almost suggest to just by the extract (also sold on Amazon). You will get much more for your money. If you look up the key ingredient, you will know all the extracts to buy. I only use eucalyptus oil myself.</li>
    <li> I use the inhalant a lot during the winter months.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the branded product by Vicks.  However, it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong odor.  You can&#x27;t even hardly smell it.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It smells like Grandma</li>
    <li> No smell. It&#x27;s just like regular oil. It has no effect for inhaler.</li>
    <li> It smells great when you walk in (if you like that menthol thing), but you get used to it quickly. I got it with the vaporizer with the inhalants because I had the flu. I couldn&#x27;t tell if it helped much, but it was the only good thing I could smell.</li>
    <li> U could nearly smell the inhalant how much ever u use</li>
    <li> It works well with that machine. Not a perfect that I thought but just fine! The price is&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than others.</li>
    <li> We use this in our vaporizer in our mountain home where the air is very dry (especially when heat is on) and it is much more effective than just steam for keeping sinus cavities clear.</li>
    <li> I use it a lot and can&#x27;t tell I am using it.  It&#x27;s not as noticeable as the Vicks warm mist I used.  I ordered several since they were cheaper... and recommended for the humidifier....you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love it, It clears me out when I am not feeling the greatest, even helps my 3 month old son.</li>
    <li> My little one and I were suffering from a horrible upper respiratory infection. The inhalation solution with the vaporizer got us over the hump.</li>
    <li> Helps me sleep much better at night. The amount included will definitely last me a very long time. Smells like Vicks.</li>
    <li> My friend just loves it. With one girl and another one in the way it is really helpful.&lt;br /&gt;She needed one.</li>
    <li> Has a funny smell. Doesnt smell good like other Vicks Vapor products.</li>
    <li> The smell is too much even in small amounts and both my dog and I have gotten sick the two times we used it. Like a dizzy almost vomiting feeling afterwards so be careful to use around pets or if you are sensitive to strong odors. I like Mentholatum but this is like krypton stuff.</li>
    <li> Got this because it&#x27;s recommended by Vicks and we use a Vicks Warm Mist humidifier in my daughter&#x27;s room.  This will put soothing vapors into the room, but gets exhausted quickly (usually needs to be emptied and replaced after a day of use).  This may explain why it&#x27;s a quarter of the price of the Vicks brand vapor oil.  The spirits in the mineral oil just wear out too quickly, then you&#x27;re left with an oil puddle in the medicine cup to clean out.</li>
    <li> great for humidifiers</li>
    <li> works amazingly! Loved it!</li>
    <li> Excellent price same as you buy at store name brand for $8</li>
    <li> Works well with the Vicks dehumidifier, no strange smells, great product</li>
    <li> Good for removing congestion</li>
    <li> would prefer if the scent were stronger</li>
    <li> A must to keep in cabinet !!!</li>
    <li> This was better than expected! Thank you.</li>
    <li> The steam activated portion of this and its wide use range likely makes this a difficult product to truly be effective. Used with the Vicks Warm mist humidfier with the cup at the top of the unit. There was no methanol smell present in the room and in the morning, the liquid was still there and did not evaporate into the steam. This may work for some units but it is one of those the price is to good to truly be a good product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those nights when your baby is all clogged up.</li>
    <li> As the saying goes \\&quot;man is the only animal that stumbles twice on the same rock\\&quot; this time I made the big mistake of buying this product (I had once bought a similar bottle under a different name). When I opened the bottle I realized this was the same oily thing with a faint smell of menthol. I tried to use it again; to no avail. Vapor Steam from CVS is the real McCoy.</li>
    <li> Nice strong inhalant.  Just as good as Vicks for a fraction of the price.  Works well in my humidifier.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased along with a gift Vaporizer!!! (needed compliment product)</li>
    <li> Works ok but has too much oil in it the Vicks evaporated and was much more aromatic this one leaves oil after evaporation , it&#x27;s not as strong as I like it to be</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this in the little inhalant bowl on top the Vicks V745.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prescribed amount does produce a therapeutic amount of Eucalyptus/Menthol/slight lavender in the air all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain is having to clean up what&#x27;s left of the mineral oil. It&#x27;s actually easy to pull out the inhalant bowl out, but if you spill it, it&#x27;s mineral oil which spreads quickly and makes a mess.</li>
    <li> An excellent inhalor.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t smell any thing after 2 hours, it seems not really vaporized.</li>
    <li> It smells nice for a few minutes but I really can&#x27;t say I felt a difference in my breathing or the air quality between running the humidifier with or without the inhalant.  I was hoping to notice an improvement. I would not recommend this inhalant, and I will be trying other brands, now that I know kaz is vicks, and both of my vicks humidifiers leaked after minimal use.</li>
