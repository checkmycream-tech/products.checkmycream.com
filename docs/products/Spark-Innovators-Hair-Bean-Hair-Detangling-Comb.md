### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>To get the best results, I recommend sectioning the hair off, and using a detangling spray.</li>
      <li>One of the best AS SEEN ON TV products I have ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>works great!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>Was definitely a good buy for me - and still can&#x27;t believe this works!</li>
      <li>And she loves playing with the case while I&#x27;m doing her hair, so also a great distraction tool.  </li>
      <li>This does a great job of not pulling it out.</li>
      <li>I know a lot of people use this on their child but, it works great on adults too.</li>
      <li>This product is so great</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply Amazing!  </li>
      <li>She is happy and so am I! :)</li>
      <li>Gets tangles out easily and feels great brushing your hair with it!</li>
      <li>I thought it would be a good detangler.</li>
      <li>The Bristles feel great through my hair and leave it feeling nice.</li>
      <li>It still does a good job though.  </li>
      <li>My nieces loved it too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>: I was very pleased.</li>
      <li>and it was like magic!</li>
      <li>I love this!  </li>
      <li>this product is AMAZING</li>
      <li>She even combs her own hair with it</li>
      <li>She went from not letting anyone brush it to doing it on her own.</li>
      <li>Some of the outer teeth have bent at the tip, or fell out, but that may be contributed to my daughter dropping it while brushing her own hair.</li>
      <li>This was wonderful for being able to brush my grand daughters hair with out tears but did not leave her hair looking smooth like in the picture.</li>
      <li>so the price here on Amazon is great and totally worth it..</li>
      <li>I Love, love, love this brush!.</li>
      <li>It really was that good!  </li>
      <li>Whats even more rewarding is watching my daughter brush her own hair now.  </li>
      <li>I have never had items just sit for many days for no reason not being packed up and put into the mail.</li>
      <li>I found this one to be a weaker product with more flimsy bristles compared to the tangle teezer.</li>
      <li>They always ask for the \\&quot;good\\&quot; brush:)  </li>
      <li>But amazingly I love this thing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really glad</li>
      <li>Of course, shop around for the best price you can find (!)</li>
      <li>it ok.it could be better.</li>
      <li>The combs \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are plastic and bendy, and six months after having this product are still intact for the most part.</li>
      <li>Like any brush, it is better to start from the bottom.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s basically what they told me in so many words.</li>
      <li>I love it..</li>
      <li>This product really does work great on all types of hair.</li>
      <li>It is ok</li>
      <li>and I like those a lot better...</li>
      <li>Believe it or not we use these as cat brushes, they just love it.  </li>
      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it for more than $5.  </li>
      <li>so buy it in stores :)</li>
      <li>Her hair has never been more silky.</li>
      <li>I actually love this brush.</li>
      <li>Also the carrying case and mirror are a plus love it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work better if you start from the top of the hair</li>
      <li>This amazing product skimmed smoothly through my hair just like a knife in butter.  </li>
      <li>If you stop brushing too soon, they will follow you around meowing for more.</li>
      <li>My grand daughter loves it</li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>Well I already had a Tangle Teezer that I love.</li>
      <li>At first, she really loved it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and really does a good job.  </li>
      <li>and I think even the name was an easy sell on her.</li>
      <li>its easy to carry around even without the carrying case.</li>
      <li>spikes of brush were falling out easily when used</li>
      <li>I have fine wavy hair that tangeled constantly--this had cut atleast 15minutes out of ny hair detangling tine</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s hair is fine and the brush does pull out hair.  </li>
      <li>The brush itself works fine, despite the bent bristles.</li>
      <li>I used to have  a huge frizz problem, but I do not need to use serum anymore.  </li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t cry and her hair was silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Works great on my sons&#x27; short hair.</li>
      <li>but my hair wasn&#x27;t smooth and tamed like the photo</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>but it felt kinda to light in my hand like I wish it was just a bit sturdier.</li>
      <li>My daughter was so excited to get this in the mail, but when we tried it out it just pulled her hair.  </li>
      <li>and It comes right out with the hair bean!</li>
      <li>This works great on both when their hair is wet after a bath or the pool.  </li>
      <li>so much I ran out and found a Ross with more to give to family.  </li>
      <li>I love this product so much.</li>
      <li>The color is not the nice bright purple shown but a dull darker purple.</li>
      <li>/&gt;One quick note.  </li>
      <li>I received the item quickly but the packaging was damaged on one corner.</li>
      <li>Even better than using their brush has been to just make sure we wash her hair daily with conditioner, and to braid it when she sleeps so it won&#x27;t tangle.</li>
      <li>I know the grip could be a little better, but the positives are more prominent than the negatives of the product.  </li>
      <li>Very much recommend!</li>
      <li>Fast, easy.  </li>
      <li>I bought several more to give as gifts at Christmas!</li>
      <li>First of all, can you say \\&quot;SHIPPING NIGHTMARE\\&quot;?!</li>
      <li>I was so excited after I read all the rave reviews because like most long curly hair women I get huge tangles.</li>
      <li>After my hair drys its not knotty, dry, or flat it looks perfect and gives my hair lots of volume.</li>
      <li>I would say its success depends on the type of hair.</li>
      <li>It feels good on my scalp, too, and it even makes combing through wet hair easier.</li>
      <li>Excellent , definitely what I expected based on reviews.</li>
      <li>yeah right.  </li>
      <li>It gets out the major tangles; sometimes I do have to follow up with a comb, but the tangles are mostly removed and I can use a comb without it hurting my daughter.  </li>
      <li>Knots are easily combed through on my 2 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping was actually very fast and the products were packaged and no damage.&lt;br /&gt;So to some it up</li>
      <li>this is much better than the competitors - they might look the same, but they are not!</li>
      <li>I paid $10 for the first one at CVS</li>
      <li>It takes a lot of strokes to work out the knots, but it does so pretty painlessly.</li>
      <li>We tried many different brushes but THIS WAS THE SOLUTION FOR US.</li>
      <li>Because of its size she can hold it pretty well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is so great and I wish I bought it sooner.  I know the grip could be a little better, but the positives are more prominent than the negatives of the product.  I use this after I use the Diane Ionic Extra Wide Tooth Comb with Handle and the two together are just so in sync and make my hair so soft and manageable.  I used to have  a huge frizz problem, but I do not need to use serum anymore.  Really all you need to do is learn how to properly comb your hair and the frizz disappears.  Also, use detangler before you use the wide tooth comb to make your results even better.</li>
    <li> Wish I had one of these when my daughter was little.... absolutely does not pull hair or hurt at all!.  I love it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback... with constant use it doesn&#x27;t last that long... I had mine for a year.. I have long hair so I used it often... after a year the teeth started falling out. I paid $10 for the first one at CVS so the price here on Amazon is great and totally worth it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy two for yourself and two for anyone else you know either with long hair or a daughter with long hair.. it will end the hassle of hair brushing....</li>
    <li> My 8 year old grand daughter starts to scream as soon as I touch a regular brush to her head.  She is very sensitive.  This thing did the trick.  She even combs her own hair with it and now I don&#x27;t have to listen to all the crying and screaming when it comes time to brush her hair.  She has long hair, very silky, not real thick but not thin either.</li>
    <li> I think this works better on wet hair. Either way it definitely made a difference and my daughter hardly complains about getting her hair brushed.</li>
    <li> I use it on my granddaughters&#x27; hair, it was a godsend! It really exceeded my expectations. My  daughter has one also.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin blonde hair that tangles so very easily!  I love this!  I bought several more to give as gifts at Christmas!</li>
    <li> It may just be the texture of my daughter&#x27;s hair but this did not work for us. She has long, thick curly hair and I felt like I was using Barbie&#x27;s brush on her hair. This did not detangle so I am going back to using a wide tooth comb and a regular brush.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to hear about his comb since I have a daily battle with my daughter to get her hair straight to go school. But is was sooo disappointed to see that this comb barely works whe. The hair is dry. The bristles are so tiny and for that reason it doesn&#x27;t detangle just make it looks its comb but really isn&#x27;t. Bottom line: I would not recommend it</li>
    <li> First of all, can you say \\&quot;SHIPPING NIGHTMARE\\&quot;?! I got mine from the Carol Wright seller. After 5 days I saw that this item had no tracking number and was holding up 2 other items I bought that did have a tracking number. One of those items was red palm oil that doesn&#x27;t need to be lingering around unrefrigerated that long. I have never had items just sit for many days for no reason not being packed up and put into the mail. One assumes the 5-8 days they tell you it will take is to account for actual shipping time. So I contacted the seller. She rudely informed me that she has no responsibility for my order. She told me to contact Amazon if I was unhappy about the shipping. I told her that sellers get rated for shipping times but she didn&#x27;t care &amp; was even more rude. When I contacted Amazon via chat the person refused to address anything I actually said. They kept repeating that the 10 day overdue date hadn&#x27;t passed yet. They would not address that my other 2 items had a tracking number already but were being held up by this item which still had no tracking. When I clicked to track my other 2 items in the supposed package it said they had been scheduled for delivery but not actually in transit yet. So essentially, the seller and Amazon stuck me in the middle of their internal business issue and forced me to bounce between them so I took all the negativity, frustration, deception and being patronized rather than them dealing with each other like professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the seller and the Rep kept telling me that none of this would happen if I had an Amazon Prime account. OMG... in other words if you don&#x27;t throw away money on a prime account you are treated like garbage! That&#x27;s basically what they told me in so many words. It&#x27;s like you have no right to complain about poor service if you don&#x27;t buy a prime account. That really steamed me that they would use this negative experience as a way to push me into buying Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I asked the Amazon rep why they have us rate the seller on shipping when Amazon is the one screwing up the shipping she told me that&#x27;s just how things are done at Amazon. The rep just kept telling me everything is okay because the LATE DATE of 10 days hasn&#x27;t passed yet. She kept saying they would pay my shipping if it ran late. I kept saying that wasn&#x27;t the issue and that I wanted to know why it was just sitting there holding up my other two items without actually being in the mail yet. That would prompt her to repeat what she said again to me like a typing parrot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As icing to this shipping fiasco cake... They refused to let me cancel the order. As for my red palm oil... the bottle was broken, leaked all over the place, and it turned rancid and smelled like someone puked in the box. It takes many days in heat for oil to rot that badly so obviously it was roughly treated by Amazon &amp; sat around in the heat for days before it even got in the mail. I know it wasn&#x27;t in the mail long enough by watching the tracking. As for the Hair Bean... it arrived today... on the last day before it would be late... 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product... Well I already had a Tangle Teezer that I love. I wanted this for the cover that came with it for putting in my purse. The color is not the nice bright purple shown but a dull darker purple. The brush bristles are a bit softer than the Tangle Teezer and so it just runs over the snarls many times before it finally gets them out. It does essentially work the same and I like the cover... so that&#x27;s the only plus side to this whole nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lessons learned: Avoid Amazon shipping like the plague. Make Amazon a last resort place to buy stuff online. Next time I&#x27;ll just go to the store and buy something I know is there. Their free shipping here is just not worth it. Last but not least... if I ever have the slightest doubt about an Amazon item I will just cancel it immediately without talking to anyone. I&#x27;ll refuse to receive it and call my credit card to help me get my money back (where I know I&#x27;m a valued customer).d to help me get my money back (where I know I&#x27;m a valued customer).</li>
    <li> I Love, love, love this brush!. Brought it for my 14 month old African American daughter hair. It was just as it advertise. no tears..</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. The Bristles feel great through my hair and leave it feeling nice. I know a lot of people use this on their child but, it works great on adults too. After my hair drys its not knotty, dry, or flat it looks perfect and gives my hair lots of volume. It really lives up to what it does and I love it. Also the carrying case and mirror are a plus love it. Thank you 5 stars bravo!!</li>
    <li> The teeth are too flexible and won&#x27;t go through my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  However, her pet cats like the way the brush feels when she uses it on them.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping it would be gently on my long, long fine hair. I thought it would be a good detangler. It works fine on my scalp, but, as soon as it hits a snag on my long hair, it stops. It doesn&#x27;t really solve tangle problems for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Works as expected. My hair does not pull as much as a regular comb would do.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was the original &amp;#34;Hair Bean&amp;#34; that we already owned several of since the packaging looks like the ones that we bought in a local store last year. The bristles are much stiffer and actually hurt my daughter to hair to use.  I am very disappointed that this is not the same as advertised!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a gimmick but after using it a few times it is the only brush that I can use on my wet, fine, bleached hair. Even wide tooth combs create knots in my hair. I have no idea how or why it works, it just does.</li>
    <li> Saved my hair. I have fine wavy hair that tangeled constantly--this had cut atleast 15minutes out of ny hair detangling tine</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because I bought one today at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for around $10 and it works extremely well.  But $23 gets a big fat WTF from me.  Works like a charm, but don&#x27;t buy it here, because this is a rip-off price.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get something to make brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair easier.  My wife gave me an A for effort, but an F for results.  This product is terrible.</li>
    <li> this product is AMAZING but whats up with the price??? i bought it in STORES and it was only 9.99! Its a ripoff here so buy it in stores :)</li>
    <li> This brush works. It takes a lot of strokes to work out the knots, but it does so pretty painlessly. My 7 year old daughter used it for a few weeks, but it has since broken and fallen apart.</li>
    <li> My 2-year old wakes up with matted tangled hair and it&#x27;s a fight every morning to comb her hair out. I tried the Hair Bean and was surprised that it actually works. No more crying struggles in the morning for us.</li>
    <li> I have a little girl and every morning is sheer torture trying to comb out her tangled fine hair without her crying. Tried every type of brush imaginable and none worked. For the 1st time in 4 years, finally I can comb my girls hair and get all the tangles out without a single tear or complaint. Thank you Hair Bean !!!</li>
    <li> May be good for children or folks with fine hair but for my thick locks a wide tooth comb is better</li>
    <li> My paddle brush works much better on my long thick hair. It didn&#x27;t brush very well for me. Someone with thin hair would probably like it more.</li>
    <li> Does just what it says. my niece stayed over and after swimming she was a mess with tangles this did work well took awhile to get the knots out but she didn&#x27;t complain hardly at all of pulling.. my only problem and not really a problem but it felt kinda to light in my hand like I wish it was just a bit sturdier. other than that it works well.</li>
    <li> Happened upon this little gem in a local discount store (similar to Ross) for $4.99. It did not look sturdy; once out of the box, the super-weak and flexible brush deflated my hopes. Then: I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s frightful dreadlock-rat&#x27;s-nest mass of hair, and...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...woah. It worked. And not \\&quot;kinda worked\\&quot; but FANTASTICALLY worked. Zero detangling spray was needed; no shrieks of pain or anguish emanating from my dulcet daughter&#x27;s lips; and we were done (as in silky-smooth done) in _five_ minutes instead of the usual 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like the Amazon price range for this item can climb up to $20-something, while discount retailers offer it closer to $5. But when I think of all the $ I won&#x27;t be spending on detangling spray anymore and how much time &amp; frustration we&#x27;ll save each day, I&#x27;d say the Hair Bean is a must even at an inflated price. Of course, shop around for the best price you can find (!) but don&#x27;t pass this item over due to price. O, Hair Bean; where have you been all my life??</li>
    <li> My hair is shoulder length. The &#x27;bean&#x27; doesn&#x27;t penetrate the hair to the scalp because the little bristles just fold down.  Unlike what is advertised, this still pulls hair out. It doesn&#x27;t brush hair well at all.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the videos you have seen.  This product works marginally well but it is not all it seems.  To think that you can run the brush through your hair once to remove tangles is just stupid.  It doesn&#x27;t work better if you start from the top of the hair as they would have you believe.  Like any brush, it is better to start from the bottom.  My son&#x27;s hair is fine and the brush does pull out hair.  It is however a little less painful than a regular brush and my son seems to like that.  (He is growing his hair out to donate.)</li>
    <li> This detangling comb does not detangle like specified or hyped about!  My daughter was so excited to get this in the mail, but when we tried it out it just pulled her hair.  We tried it several times on wet hair and other times when her hair was dry.  There was no easy detangling at all with this &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; comb.  Just wasted my money on this product.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I have hair that is past my waist. This does a great job of not pulling it out. Lost the last one was grateful to find that they can still be purchased.</li>
    <li> I have really long, curly hair.  This amazing product skimmed smoothly through my hair just like a knife in butter.  I LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! Gets tangles out easily and feels great brushing your hair with it! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters&#x27; hair. They both hated to have their hair combed. My 5 year old would cry about everytime she had her hair combed. Now she loves to comb her hair and no crying! The comb just glides right thru her hair, wet or dry. This invention is a life saver.</li>
    <li> This was wonderful for being able to brush my grand daughters hair with out tears but did not leave her hair looking smooth like in the picture. Comparing the price to other products like this I would definitely buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is not the real hair bean as all the teeth broke within 3weeks of not so frequent use</li>
    <li> I got this for my autistic daughter since she has major sensory issues with her hair but wants it long. At first, she really loved it. But I only gave it 4 stars since she has now gone back to her brush that has a handle. Even better than using their brush has been to just make sure we wash her hair daily with conditioner, and to braid it when she sleeps so it won&#x27;t tangle. But it does work, and it is gently and doesn&#x27;t snag like the usual brushes that have the balls on the end of the tines.</li>
    <li> This product really does work great on all types of hair. Excellent , definitely what I expected based on reviews.</li>
    <li> this product saves so much pain from tangles and loss of hair from pulling hair tangles out. its easy to carry around even without the carrying case.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not we use these as cat brushes, they just love it.  Can&#x27;t get enough.  If you stop brushing too soon, they will follow you around meowing for more.</li>
    <li> My grand daughter loves it</li>
    <li> If you have very curly hair, this product will only snag on your tendrils and rip them out.  Not a good product!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of these before spotting one in the Walgreen&#x27;s clearance aisle for $2.50. I thought that I&#x27;d give it a try. My three year old hated having her hair brushed. There are absolutely no complaints whenever I use the Hair Bean on her. I am so thankful to have found this. Our mornings used to be a big headache but now, there&#x27;s no crying and no fuss. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough!</li>
    <li> For me, it doesn&#x27;t work. I was so excited after I read all the rave reviews because like most long curly hair women I get huge tangles. My problem with this is that wet or dry instead of gently gliding through the matted balls of hair that I get it just gently glides over top of them without actually going through them. This is clearly a problem because the whole point of brushing and combing is to remove the tangles.  In addition,  I found just as much hair in the beam after one use as I did my trusty old wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> I have 4 year old twins.  One has thick curly hair and the other not so thick curly/wavy hair. They have the awful tangles when they get up in the morning.  This works great on my daughter with the not so thick hair and just okay on my daughter with really thick hair.  I think the bristles are just too short to work well on thick hair.  It still does a good job though.  No complaints while I&#x27;m brushing out their hair in the morning.  They always ask for the \\&quot;good\\&quot; brush:)  This works great on both when their hair is wet after a bath or the pool.  I&#x27;m really glad I got this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One quick note.  I read a read a review that said it pulls out the hair and for that reason I was hesitant to buy this brush.  But when I looked at the brush after using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair, I didn&#x27;t see any hair left behind so that was not an issue for me.</li>
    <li> The Hair Bean Detangling Comb is a miracle in our household! My daughter has thick wavy/curly hair that snarls very easily. She has always been one of those little girls that runs when it is time to have her hair brushed/combed.  The combs \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are plastic and bendy, and six months after having this product are still intact for the most part. Some of the outer teeth have bent at the tip, or fell out, but that may be contributed to my daughter dropping it while brushing her own hair. To get the best results, I recommend sectioning the hair off, and using a detangling spray. You need to work it through gently and try not to tug. Believe it or not, her hair looks smoother and bouncier after I have combed through her hair with it. A must for young children with unruly hair.</li>
    <li> I received the item quickly but the packaging was damaged on one corner. Also if the hair is very long or thick, it&#x27;s not easy to hold onto.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair in that the strands are thick, but I do have a lot of hair. The bristles on this aren&#x27;t nearly long enough to comb through. I tried it twice and gave it to my step-daughter who has fairly thin hair. She loves it and it doesn&#x27;t cause flyaways. I&#x27;d say this product might work well for children, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up for me.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush but mine came with bent bristles, like it had been sat on or something. Also, I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month and the logo on the top of the case is half worn off and the case doesn&#x27;t like to stay shut. The brush itself works fine, despite the bent bristles.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this thing, it just zips through the tangles, and I lose much less hair than with my regular brush. It feels good on my scalp, too, and it even makes combing through wet hair easier. My hair is very long, and wavy and fine, and it tangles very badly. I could hardly believe how easily this went through my hair. I even ran a small comb through it after I used the hair bean, just to make sure it really had detangled it, and the small comb went right through like a hot knife through butter.. amazing! I was skeptical that it could be as good as the reviews, but it really is. Get it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 3 yr old who has very, very curly hair.  I figured for the price, what the heck, why not?  It&#x27;s easy to hold and really does a good job.  Whats even more rewarding is watching my daughter brush her own hair now.  Because of its size she can hold it pretty well.  I&#x27;d say go for it and try it out!</li>
    <li> My 9 year old has very think hair and it was a nightmare to get her to brush and a painful experience for us both when I would do it. We tried many different brushes but THIS WAS THE SOLUTION FOR US. No more cries and she&#x27;ll just sit and brush for the enjoyment of it. Her hair has never been more silky. I don&#x27;t usually do reviews but I had to write this one.</li>
    <li> I bought the Hair Bean for my 6 year old daughter and it actually works in getting out tangles and messy hair. She has pretty long hair that is VERY prone to tangling and I had tried detanglers, braiding her hair before bed, etc. but only this as reliably worked. Sometimes it still pulls and hurts her but it typically doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> My daughter hated getting her hair brushed in the morning before school.  She would cry and we would fight.  I bought the Hair Bean thinking that it was my last chance before I was going to cut all of her hair off!  I got it home and brushed her hair and it was like magic! She didn&#x27;t cry and her hair was silky smooth. One of the best AS SEEN ON TV products I have ever purchased.  Yay Hair Bean!</li>
    <li> I have 2 daughters with EXTREMELY sensitive scalps, and was hoping that this would be the &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; solution, while it does ease brushing a bit, it was still a crying fit fest when I pulled on any snags in their hair.....so......yes, it kinda helps, but it did not end the crying &amp; tears :(</li>
    <li> This brush did not work well on wet hair at all, bristles are not long enough to brush out tangles.</li>
    <li> It is very stiff and hard on your scalp! There is no flexibility at all so you end up hurting yourself. It seemed to pull a lot of hair out, too, instead of just flowing through. I was very disappointed because I had really like a similar brush that does what this one is supposed to do. I previously purchased a different brand with the same idea and I like those a lot better... [...]</li>
    <li> It is ok but it is not easier than with other brush, it is comfortable to Cary this one in my handbag .</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair. It&#x27;s too soft to get through the tangles:( I would not recommend it.  Works great on my sons&#x27; short hair.</li>
    <li> Knots are easily combed through on my 2 year old daughter.  Tried using a wide-tooth comb, but combs pull her curly hair &amp; hurt her.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I have a very sensitive head and all other brushes rip out my hair and hurt. But this did not. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. My nieces loved it too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 5 and 6 year old girls .  If used with a leave in conditioner or detangle spray, it works very well on bed head and such .</li>
    <li> My daughter has curly hair and it has always been a battle of tears when combing out her hair. We have spent all sorts of money on detanglers and have been disappointed.  I saw a review of this product on our local news and it got a positive rating so I gave it a shot and it actually works!  It gets out the major tangles; sometimes I do have to follow up with a comb, but the tangles are mostly removed and I can use a comb without it hurting my daughter.  She is happy and so am I! :)</li>
    <li> My only problem with this brush is that the bristles weaken too quickly - but for the price it&#x27;s practically a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having less tears is worth having to replace this brush every 6 months.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old daughter hated brushing her hair because her head is sensitive but this is her new favorite. She went from not letting anyone brush it to doing it on her own. She carries her Hair Bean around with her and I think even the name was an easy sell on her. I definitely recommend it. Had it 6 months or so with no breaking of the bristles even in the hands of a child.</li>
    <li> I saw this at a Ross outlet store and figured for 4.99 what the heck, I could use it as a lint brush.  But amazingly I love this thing, it&#x27;s gentle and it works!  Like it so much I ran out and found a Ross with more to give to family.  Works to de-fur the heavy undercoat of my Maine Coon cat too (got one just for the pets).  It&#x27;s not strong enough to pull out heavy mats on a pet, but for what it is it works great.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except I am not sure how long something like this will last, as the teeth are soft-ish, but feels like a gently massage and detangles my dry-ish colored hair.  The price listed through Amazon is too high, I&#x27;d say the 4.99 I paid at Ross is about right.  Was definitely a good buy for me - and still can&#x27;t believe this works!</li>
    <li> My hair tends to get tangled when I sleep, I thought I would use this so I don&#x27;t look like a wild women when I go downstairs after getting up, well it got the tangles out but my hair wasn&#x27;t smooth and tamed like the photo instead it was still wild, but no tangles. Oh and my hair is straight, not curly and it is not thick so why can&#x27;t my hair look like the photo they advertise?</li>
    <li> works great! I never had any problems with ,and its very durable. It doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit even with knots! Great product.</li>
    <li> Ooh this does wonders! I always get these tight tangles under my hair in the back of my head and It comes right out with the hair bean! this really does work I promise! It will/might make your hair frizz like every other brush so I just run some water over it and all is well</li>
    <li> I bought this for $5 at Ross for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is fairly thin and gets big knots in the back from sleeping on it.  Naturally she hates all brushing.  This works extremely well on her hair.  I don&#x27;t like how it feels on my hair though.  It doesn&#x27;t dig in deep enough for me.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t have tried it for more than $5.  The product gets mixed reviews elsewhere.  I would say its success depends on the type of hair.</li>
    <li> this is much better than the competitors - they might look the same, but they are not! stick with the hair bean.</li>
    <li> I first got 1 of these for my long hair a couple of yrs ago, now I needed a new one. Hard to find in my area, so I got 2 this time.</li>
    <li> it ok.it could be better. it pulls but i must say detangling my hair is MUCH faster. i have thick curly hair with soo many knots and noow i can etengle my hair in 5 min instead of 15. not a FABULOUS brush but still an ok brush</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me the Hair Bean for Christmas because I have very long, very curly hair.  I thought, yeah right.  So, I gave it the ultimate test.  I didn&#x27;t brush my hair for a whole day, slept on it loose (instead of braiding it) and jumped into the shower without brushing my hair first.  I was all ready to toss the thing but, shock of shocks, it worked like a dream!  The Hair Bean practically floated through my hair.  And, I noticed very little hair loss after in the Hair Bean itself.  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s hair. My other daughter got the hot pink one that is actually called tangle teezer or something like that. I found this one to be a weaker product with more flimsy bristles compared to the tangle teezer.</li>
    <li> No more bed-head tangles.  No more daily painful 40-minute hairbrushing sessions. Fast, easy.  No broken hairs on brush. Very gentle for a sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> I am a man with long hair and little patience for detangling.  This is the rare detangle product that actual works.  I have two (One at home and one in the car).  Very much recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap plastic. The bristles are small. I can&#x27;t get it through long hair.</li>
    <li> Just tried this on my 19 month old daughter with thick natural curly hair and it truly is the miracle brush.  My husband said that I spoke of it like a person addicted to &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34;!! Hahahaahaha. It really was that good!  If you&#x27;ve ever dreaded hair day with your toddler, you must must buy this detangler brush.  It&#x27;s simply Amazing!  No tears at all from my daughter. And she loves playing with the case while I&#x27;m doing her hair, so also a great distraction tool.  I&#x27;ll update this review later if/when I notice the issues with the bristles that others have commented on.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and this is the only brush i could find that doesnt hurt or pull tons of my hair out.</li>
    <li> I actually love this brush. It makes my hair very soft and straightens it a little as well. My boyfriends family saw me using this brush so I ordered them some!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was actually very fast and the products were packaged and no damage.&lt;br /&gt;So to some it up: I was very pleased.</li>
    <li> spikes of brush were falling out easily when used</li>
    <li> The Hair Bean: Very compact and this little bean really works well and will not pull or rip hair; I love it!!;</li>
