      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve bleached your hair before and know what to expect from a lightener, this is great.</li>

      <li>This worked surprisingly well.</li>

      <li>instructions were very easy to follow.</li>

      <li>I love the  color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different hair lighteners and have found this to be the best.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planning on using it one maybe 2 more times</li>
      <li>I am so pleased that I found this hair bleach on Amazon.</li>
      <li>like i did or more.</li>
      <li>This is definitely the best value for money around.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I used this product to do so.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Then I read  more reviews and  bought  purple  </li>
      <li>Plus the color is not too light, which might not be the best for some girls, but considering that my hair is so extremely dark, I am extremely happy with how light the products makes my hair :)</li>
      <li>actually pretty good at doing this now.&lt;br /&gt;better</li>
      <li>But I am completely happy so far.</li>
      <li>I have medium brown hair and this color takes my hair to the most beautiful platinum blonde!</li>
      <li>Perfect to now color a bold red.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s platinum and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>I would say it was easy to mix and use...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It took awhile for me to get up the nerve to do   my own hair for the first time after a 35 year break.  </li>
      <li>, I now have baby-soft, light golden blonde hair (almost platinum) that smells great!</li>
      <li>I have light brown hair and this product makes my hair a beautiful platinum blonde.  </li>
      <li>My brown hair became a lovely Super Orange.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve light brown hair, and it says medium brown.</li>
      <li>I used this  about  2 weeks  ago,  and wasn&#x27;t happy with the red  </li>
      <li>u will have orange streaks, they make it sound like its your fault.  </li>
      <li>I was not disappointed at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is beach and a cream for a conditioner,  I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>
      <li>Besides bleaching it has a conditioner which I use after the first 10 or 15 shampoos and keeps my hair looking really healthy.</li>
      <li>Makes my already natural blonde hair an awesome shade of platinum without bleaching or paying salon price.</li>
      <li>I dye my hair regularly but still try to keep it in good shape.</li>
      <li>Good, simple bleach kit for quick touch-ups</li>
      <li>but it did it really quickly...</li>
      <li>This product arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fumes are more subtle, the shampoo it comes with has a great honeysuckle fragrance</li>
      <li>If applied for the same amount of time with every application, the blond hue remains consistent and truly, beautifully bright.</li>
      <li>Confusing directions, and the bleach isn&#x27;t very good for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>test strips came out very shiny and smooth (but not mushy at all).</li>
      <li>I went from bright, fire engine red to WHITE up on top and neon-pink at the tips.</li>
      <li>My hair was bleach blonde and the color had a nice depth to it.</li>
      <li>, so I could acheive a nice honey blonde color.   </li>
      <li>Got dark brown hair that I have to a perfect bleach blonde.</li>
      <li>Not sure what volume this uses, but it&#x27;s the best bleach you can get at the drugstore without having to research how to do it yourself professionally.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost everything at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, and several from drugstores, and this is the best one hands down.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect (as long as I make sure to leave it in long enough).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as easy and cheap to run to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and buy the Salon Care Blue Flash lightening powder with some 40 vol developer.  </li>
      <li>The color was extremely cool, really.</li>
      <li>The bleach lightened my hair a good 4-5 shades from the dark brown it used to be.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of hair lighteners on my dark brown hair, and this product is far superior to even the color I&#x27;ve received in salons!</li>
      <li>The developer is nice and creamy so an even application is very easy,  and although it won&#x27;t take your hair from black to blonde it will significantly lighten it without frying it</li>
      <li>and  Manic Panic Virgin Snow...both worked great  at  making the red look really blonde</li>
      <li>It arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
      <li>The first time i used this bleaching kit i kept the dye in for 80 mins.</li>
      <li>, always make sure you only get the bleach on your roots!</li>
      <li>Highly Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands of bleach over the ten years I have been coloring my hair.</li>
      <li>But overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>Thank you im buying 2 more on the 3rd.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions EXACTLY as they were written</li>
      <li>First try, orange-brown.</li>
      <li>I purchased two of these just to be safe, but only needed one box.</li>
      <li>My spotty, streaky, orange-ish, brown-ish results aren&#x27;t exactly a surprise, but I&#x27;m still disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This color did exactly that.</li>
      <li>and I ended up with the hair of an avid fan of University of Tennessee</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It may be my fault because I&#x27;ve dyed my hair in the past from dark brown to black to reddish. But only a few inches of my hair from that remained. However, I don&#x27;t know if it was that or the product but only about 3\\&quot; of my hair became yellowy blonde. The ending 4\\&quot; turned orange-y. I used toner and am now bleaching it again. Anyway, seems like an okay product.</li>
    <li> Disgusting!!!! My once soft hair now feels like straw!!! So disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> This will get medium to dark brown hair a pale yellow color, like most blonding kits.&lt;br /&gt;This one is more pleasant to use. It&#x27;s fumes are more subtle, the shampoo it comes with has a great honeysuckle fragrance and it&#x27;s mush less damaging to the hair, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the results and have found less split and dried out ends.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had a previous bad experience by dyeing my hair black professionally. After waiting four months to regrow my terrible hair back, I decided I waited enough to try this product (L&#x27;Oreal Paris Super Blonde Crème Lightening Kit), so I could acheive a nice honey blonde color.   While I give it one star for turning my roots a nice golden color, and another star for hiding a previous bad hair dye that occurred near my roots, I was VERY disappointed that it did not turn my dyed black hair blonde, but burgundy! So now my roots are gold and the hair beyond my ears is a dark red, and I followed the instructions carefully. This product claimed to lighten even previous artificial color to a blondish color.   I followed the instructions by starting at the ends first and continuing on to my roots last, but only my roots changed drastically during the waiting period. Could it be that I have to reapply the product again on my chemically dyed hair? Whatever the reason, I am very disappointed that it did not bleach my previously dyed hair evenly. For those who want to fix a previous bad hair dye, do not use this product; it will only call attention to it by contrasting  the natural and dyed colors of your hair.</li>
    <li> the boss loves this product. hasn&#x27;t found it cheaper elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;me i&#x27;m the grunt hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m actually pretty good at doing this now.&lt;br /&gt;better than that orange color she got from the salon........</li>
    <li> Impressed with product. It arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Good, simple bleach kit for quick touch-ups</li>
    <li> This Loreal super blonde and the New Loreal Paris creme lightening kit only lighten to a certain point.  Instead of explaining that you are going to need a toner like wella charm or u will have orange streaks, they make it sound like its your fault.  U will need  a toner.</li>
    <li> did not lighten my hair as stated on package.  My hair was dark brown before and after leaving the kit on for an hour, my hair came out a medium strawberry blonde</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is medium brown with red tint. The first time i used this bleaching kit i kept the dye in for 80 mins. When i washed it out my roots were bleach blonde and faded to a light orange at the roots. It wasnt too bad, it looked a little strawberry blondish, but i wanted bleach blonde color. I kept my hair the orange color for a week then used loreal bleaching kit again and kept it on for 60 mins. When i washed out the dye the color was PERFECT. My hair was bleach blonde and the color had a nice depth to it. The kit promises bleach blonde results on the first go, but unless you already have light brown/dark blonde hair, your probably going to have to use it twice like i did or more. When my roots came out, 2+ weeks later, i died my hair dark blonde. My hair held on to the color well and because my hair was bleach blonde before dying to dark blonde, my hair turned out the exact shade of dark blonde i wanted and what was on the box. After my roots had come in again, about a month later (roots showed less because of the darker color), i decided to go bleach blonde again. I used the loreal bleaching kit again and in one dye session my hair turned right back to bleach blonde pale yellow and my roots blended perfectly with the rest of my hair. My hair is a little fried but i condition it and do oil treatments, which help a lot. Its been two weeks since i bleached my hair and im probably gonna bleach it again to get rid of my roots in a few days. THIS IS A REALLY GREAT BLEACHING PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Makes my already natural blonde hair an awesome shade of platinum without bleaching or paying salon price.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t high enough volume to get the results advertised. I&#x27;ve light brown hair, and it says medium brown. I left it in for the maximum time recommmended and it turned a vomit-coloured orange.</li>
    <li> Not sure what volume this uses, but it&#x27;s the best bleach you can get at the drugstore without having to research how to do it yourself professionally.</li>
    <li> This is beach and a cream for a conditioner,  I&#x27;m pretty sure. From the way it lightened my hair,  I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s 20vol. It really did lighten my hair from a dark-med I&#x27;m brown, but of course not to the white blonde on the box,  just a golden blonde which I really think is pretty at least for now.  The developer is nice and creamy so an even application is very easy,  and although it won&#x27;t take your hair from black to blonde it will significantly lighten it without frying it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bleached b4 but this s*** turned my hair turned yellow. I had to use a salon who used toner to fix it.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased that I found this hair bleach on Amazon. I did a lot of research trying to find a bleach that would turn my blue/black hair blonde. Of all the products I looked at and read reviews of this was the least damaging and most promising I could find, so I gave it a chance. I dye my hair regularly but still try to keep it in good shape. This was my first time bleaching my entire head at home and I&#x27;m so glad I used this product to do so. For a bleach it is hardly damaging to hair and the smell isn&#x27;t even that strong. My advice is to follow the instructions exactly for the best results. I left mine on for the maximum time (60 minutes from when first applying it to the back). To avoid the brassiness (orange/yellow shades in hair after bleaching) a lot of other reviewers complained about, a toner after the bleaching is a must! I will definitely be using this product again in the future and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s on Amazon because none of my local stores stock it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of hair lighteners on my dark brown hair, and this product is far superior to even the color I&#x27;ve received in salons! If applied for the same amount of time with every application, the blond hue remains consistent and truly, beautifully bright. I swear by this product, and have not found an equal. Usually, hair lighteners add an orangy tinge to my darker hair when I try to go blond, but not with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Super Blond! I&#x27;ve tried the #205 but felt it was too close to the white/gray spectrum for me, so #200 is my go-to platinum blond color of choice. It&#x27;s an excellent product that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  I did perform a strand test beforehand, which didn&#x27;t really help since it&#x27;s only on a thin strand of hair.  You really need to see it on a lot more than just a thin strand to see the color. I left this product on for the full 60 mins to get the maximum blonde result.  My brown hair became a lovely Super Orange.</li>
    <li> I normally have very dark brown that&#x27;s almost black.  The first time I used this product it turned my hair a dark strawberry reddish color. I have used this 4 times now and my hair has gone from dark strawberry red to light strawberry red to strawberry blonde. Each time I use the product I keep it on for 60-70 minutes. I&#x27;m planning on using it one maybe 2 more times so I can get to the pale blonde color.   I like the product because it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair all that much and my hair goes back to it&#x27;s normal condition after a few days.  I don&#x27;t think think it&#x27;s very accurate for the box to say it is for dark brown hair. But overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair lightener. It worked great for me. I use this brand every month for root touch up&#x27;s..</li>
    <li> I used this as an alternative to mixing my own bleach kit. I went from bright, fire engine red to WHITE up on top and neon-pink at the tips. The color was extremely cool, really. And then I promptly dyed over it with purple. But even so! Well done, L&#x27;Oreal. I&#x27;ll probably be using you again sometime.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them all yet. But I am completely happy so far.</li>
    <li> It works and its not the ugly blonde that other dyes give you! This is not orange-y in color. It&#x27;s platinum and it&#x27;s easy to use. I used it to ombre. Worked wonders.</li>
    <li> Thank you im buying 2 more on the 3rd. Do you have light reddish blonde</li>
    <li> TURNED MY BLACK HAIR BROWN.</li>
    <li> I used this on my roots because my hair is bleach blonde (done by a professional) but my roots were about 2 inches long and driving me crazy. The result was a pale yellow (what happens at the salon) and I will need to apply a purple toner to make it look professional. The creme was forgiving and bleached every strand. My hair is chin length and naturally dark ash blonde. I applied the solution to the crown to let the underneath grow back to my natural color and left it on for about 20 minutes because I was afraid of breakage. I also used clips to section hair and applied it carefully.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve bleached your hair before and know what to expect from a lightener, this is great. If you don&#x27;t have experience bleaching your hair, I recommend going to a professional or doing a lot of research before applying any product.</li>
    <li> I used this  about  2 weeks  ago,  and wasn&#x27;t happy with the red  still in my hair,  so I put  a red  brown  dye back  on it... then a week later  I decided  to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;I  was  ok  with  it after applying Revlon  Color  Silk  04.  Then I read  more reviews and  bought  purple  shampoo  Schwarzkopf, amazing product! and  Manic Panic Virgin Snow...both worked great  at  making the red look really blonde, the  shampoo is better, and  you  save  your  hair from  extra bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I love the  color, it looks very pale  blonde,  not  white  though.  Now  what to  do when roots  come in.  Also  I  need  to mention  my hair is  really short,  and I condition  constanlty.  Any  help on  how to do  my roots would be nice.</li>
    <li> My hair is dark brown--very dark brown. This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found where my hair ends of the color pictured on the carton! Also, it does not burn my scalp. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> Does Miracles on Brunette Long Roots...Doesn&#x27;t Damage...give it the correct time, try to cover the application in plastic wrap and it WORKS!</li>
    <li> I agree that this is the best non-professional hair lightener out there.  As others mentioned, its scent is mild and the product works well without being harsh.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of different hair lighteners and have found this to be the best.  For most users, you&#x27;ll have to add a toner, a semi-permanent color, or colored shampoo to neutralize out the gold or orange after you use this lightener--except for those lucky few who have little to no gold or red in their natural hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dye since I was a kid. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly.  It took awhile for me to get up the nerve to do   my own hair for the first time after a 35 year break.  Works great.  Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This stuff works amazing!! Got dark brown hair that I have to a perfect bleach blonde. Highly Highly recommend!! Didn&#x27;t fry my hair either :D</li>
    <li> Confusing directions, and the bleach isn&#x27;t very good for color treated hair. If your hair is natural, no problem. But if you&#x27;re trying to get rid of dye, PICK SOME OTHER BLEACH. Takes forever and it left bleach burns on my skin. My hair went from dyed a light-ish red to being pale pumpkin orange. Hate it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 4 years now and I love it.  I was tired of paying so much at the salon since my hair grows so fast I need it done atleast once a month and figured I could do it myself.  I picked up a box of this and never looked back.  I have light brown hair and this product makes my hair a beautiful platinum blonde.  I get compliments on the color daily.  I will never use another product because this one does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the difference between this and the L&#x27;Oreal Excellence light blonde.</li>
    <li> The best hair color. Besides bleaching it has a conditioner which I use after the first 10 or 15 shampoos and keeps my hair looking really healthy. Plus the color is not too light, which might not be the best for some girls, but considering that my hair is so extremely dark, I am extremely happy with how light the products makes my hair :)</li>
    <li> Took my hair from very, very dark to a brassy blonde in 40 minutes.  Perfect to now color a bold red.  This product did not smell, burn or drip.  Much better than expected results.  The best bleach I have used thus far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo to show my pre-lightened hair color vs. the test strips at 1 hour and 1.5 hours. The product smells very strong. Use in a highly ventilated location. If you have long hair you will need 2 bottles. It mixes very easily and the powder does not get in the air if you&#x27;re careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creme is very thick and stays put. You&#x27;ll definitely need a helper to get the back and the roots since it doesn&#x27;t shift much at all once it&#x27;s on your hair. There&#x27;s no more burning sensation than I get with any other permanent color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test strips came out very shiny and smooth (but not mushy at all). I pulled the hairs and there&#x27;s slightly less elasticity than my normal hair but it&#x27;s still very healthy and *so* shiny! I started with dyed, very very dark brown hair (nearly black) and had pink highlight on top of that. Ive never bleached my hair before. I find the red-orange color to be quite beautiful in sunlight! It reminds me of a nice, natural red hair color.</li>
    <li> I tried using this to go blonde for halloween for my costume. After following all the instructions AND doing a strand test that turned out well, I decided to apply it to my head. after the 70 minutes that my strand test said I should use, I washed it out only to find that my roots were banana yellow and the rest of my hair was ORANGE!!! thank goodness it was almost halloween so I could go as a pumpkin but I will not be using this again. I had to go to a salon in order to fix the color!</li>
    <li> This product does lighten hair, but usually takes two boxes for dark hair. It is all very well and good, but it smells HORRIBLE! If you have nasal allergies or asthma DO NOT use this product. It has a very strong ammonia smell. I nearly passed out from the smell so I refuse to ever use this product again. And yes, I had opened the windows so everything was well ventilated, but it was still too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 3 of 5 stars. It does lighten hair and does what it should, but the smell is horrific.</li>
    <li> I wanted to take my medium brunette hair to blonde and this product says it will do that.  I followed the instructions EXACTLY as they were written and I ended up with the hair of an avid fan of University of Tennessee (Go Big Orange!)...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d done my research ahead of time and I&#x27;d read several reviews, so I can&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t warned.  My spotty, streaky, orange-ish, brown-ish results aren&#x27;t exactly a surprise, but I&#x27;m still disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very expensive, so I&#x27;m not bummed out about losing the money, but it was a big waste of time and I feel stupid for not heeding the advice of so many others.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is already VERY light, this product may work for you.  If your hair is any darker than an extremely light brown, please don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  It&#x27;s just as easy and cheap to run to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and buy the Salon Care Blue Flash lightening powder with some 40 vol developer.  That&#x27;s what I finally did to fix my hair &amp; thanks to Sally&#x27;s (not L&#x27;Oreal), I now have baby-soft, light golden blonde hair (almost platinum) that smells great!</li>
    <li> This product works like it is suppose to not much to be said, the box was a little damaged at the corners though.</li>
    <li> I have never rated this product by given it any star; and I have never wrote a review for this product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Marlene Farrell-Trent</li>
    <li> You must use this at least twice to get blond hair. I have dark brown almost black hair. First try, orange-brown. 2nd bleaching, yellow.blonde. Now I&#x27;m getting a toner to make it less yellow. People that try products like these and expect to come out exactly like the box, and get angry and give it bad ratings need to research beforehand how to bleach their hair to the way they want it. Other then that, this product works well. Works great!</li>
    <li> First, I was very SKETPICAL to use this product, because I have only ever used Ion hair color from Sally’s in Lightest Cool Blonde. I decided to give this a shot, because of the high level of ratings on this product online. I also googled and checked Amazon reviews and checked reviews on the manufacturer’s website. All had like 80% of reviewers critiquing it as high. So, I gave it a shot…. I was not disappointed at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am naturally dirty blond/dishwater blond and my hair lifts to platinum blond easily. This color did exactly that. It lifted evenly and gave me very, very platinum blond hair like the white, ethereal color that I was wanting.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were very easy to follow. The box recommends anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes. I left mine on for 20 minutes and then checked it. It had completely lifted to platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was yellow… THIS IS NORMAL though, because some people’s hair lifts to either yellow or orange when going so light. Go to Sally’s and get the WELLA TONER in T-14 “Palest Ash Blond” (another name is “White Lady”). I left this on for 5 minutes! BE CAREFUL not to live it on too long when it starts turning, RINSE IT OUT! This lifts that yellow or orange out of your hair and will literally make your hair look amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> This worked surprisingly well. I was trying to get my dyed dark brown hair back to its natural shade(sort of an ash blonde.) Having never bleached my hair myself before, I was kind of nervous, but it wasn&#x27;t hard. It lightened my hair to a blonde-orange, but I was expecting that, and the next day I dyed it over with an ash blonde hair color, and it took a lot of the orange out. Another ash blonde box should have my hair where I want it. My hair was a little drier after the bleaching but no tingling or burning. I quite recommend this.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t bleach my undyed hair at all, and the part I had previously dyed turned several shades of pink. (And not pretty shades either.)</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Super\\&quot; is definitely an exaggeration, and a huge one at that. The box said that it could bring even the darkest hair colors to an almost icy blonde. My natural hair was dark brown. I got between a medium blonde and a sandy blonde. I even went well past the time limit. It&#x27;s decent, but not all it&#x27;s hyped up to be.</li>
    <li> This one is the 205 which I did not order or use .  I ordered the 200 and I will wait until Amazon brings it back, I can not comment on this 205 because I have never used it.</li>
    <li> I have black colored hair and it did nothing to my hair. My roots were like a honey brown, which is my natural hair color and it turned them orange. I do not recommend this because I have used other stuff before and my roots have went to platnium blonde. I only recommend this if you are already a shade of blonde.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally almost black. I have tried many brands of bleach over the ten years I have been coloring my hair. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, and several from drugstores, and this is the best one hands down. It&#x27;s the only one that gets my whole head blonde. It&#x27;s very easy to use and this one has conditioning cream in it that makes it a little easier on the hair. It even removes colors such as pink and purple, for the most part. This is definitely the best value for money around.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!  this is the one I always use when i dye my hair.  I have really dark hair normally.</li>
    <li> I NEVER EVER! Going to look for another product to lighten my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product for five years now. And Each and every time I uses this.. This is extremely making me feel happier.. Although, You do really need to get a lot of conditioner to be put on your hair once you started dyeing your hair.. Cause, Whether we like it or not. We seriously, going to strip away your natural hair oil. But,  the colors is definitely up to the expectations that i wanted.. But, I just uses other conditioner to make it lighter white. If, you want your hair lighter. But, so far. I love this product. And it doesn&#x27;t sting like hell.. like, all the other products I uses. GOd! those, other hair dye is killing my scalp. This is way smoother and it doesn&#x27;t affect my scalp or burn my scalp at all.. I Recommend this product ten times..</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair that never gets yellow with these drugstore type bleaches..but after I read other reviews I thought I would try it...I used it to bleach the lower bottom part of my hair soi could do ombre hair...I would say it was easy to mix and use...It wasn&#x27;t drippy...and it changed my dark brown hair light pretty quickly.....in less than 30 minutes...I only let my hair get to the red stage...because  my hombre  color was a burgundy red...but it did it really quickly...just make sure you comb it through and get it all on the underpart of your hair...or you may end up with skunk patches!!</li>
    <li> I was pretty shocked with this product. My hair is very thick and fairly long, so it typically takes me two full boxes of hair dye to dye my hair/ I purchased two of these just to be safe, but only needed one box. The bleach lightened my hair a good 4-5 shades from the dark brown it used to be. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair dozens of times over the last few years, so when my hair came out orange I wasn&#x27;t at all surprised. YOU WILL NEED TO USE A TONER WITH THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I have been using this box color for almost two years and haven&#x27;t looked back. I have medium brown hair and this color takes my hair to the most beautiful platinum blonde! I time it for about an hour once I start the application and it&#x27;s perfect (as long as I make sure to leave it in long enough). There were a few times when I didn&#x27;t time it right and ended up with a yellowish tint, which is annoying, but I learned my lesson and pay more attention to the clock. It comes with a conditioning shampoo packet to use after you rinse the bleach out and I ALWAYS do a deep condition after the shampoo. If you don&#x27;t your hair can be a little brittle and more prone to breakage. If you plan on just doing a root touch up, which is what I do, always make sure you only get the bleach on your roots! If you aren&#x27;t careful and get it all over your already bleached hair it can, and will, break off. Blondes can have it all as long as you read the directions ;)</li>
