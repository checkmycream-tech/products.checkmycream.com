      <li>They&#x27;d be great for a medical kit, too!</li>
      <li>Would give it a five, but nothing to carry it in, so I am using the original case for the pens.</li>

      <li>Does the job, does the job quick and</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m a new convert to double-edge shaving, I figured I&#x27;d better get a styptic pencil \\&quot;just in case.\\</li>
      <li>Great for little nicks.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>This is a good product for stopping minor nicks, exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t go better than old school styptic pencils when you get a cut.</li>
      <li>and I would say I got about 25 cents worth of styptic out of this order.</li>

      <li>You are supposed to rinse the pencil before use and the water erodes that pencil pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Stops bleeding from shaving lacerations right away.  </li>
      <li>We were looking for something exactly like this after my husband cut himself shaving on vacation and nothing seemed to stem the flow of blood.  </li>
      <li>It arrived promptly despite the fact that I ordered it during the holiday season and it does exactly what a styptic pencil is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying these again if I need more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;RIP first pencil.</li>
      <li>But when I do run out I would most likely reorder.</li>
      <li>they work exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Which is good, because these pencils were a waste.</li>
      <li>ran a fowl of a Feather blade (really good DE blades but very sharp!)</li>
      <li>As expected in the transition from bank draining cartridges to more economical shaves, I ended up with a nick or two.  </li>
      <li>It was my first time shaving with a straight razor so my face was the Niagra Falls of blood.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I ended up getting a Merkur safety razor (as a first step toward straight razor shaving).  </li>
      <li>Yes, it does leave some white residue, but that&#x27;s easily washed off.  </li>
      <li>After the job is done let it dry completely before putting it in some kind of protective case to keep them from breaking.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about these stypic pencils, but they work.  </li>
      <li>but I was very embarrassed.</li>
      <li>Really needs to have a storage place or case built in.</li>
      <li>Works and fast delivery</li>
      <li>They are an absolute necessity, they stop bleeding from cuts and nicks in seconds.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>This will prove very beneficial over it&#x27;s life.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Since I shave practically my whole face and head</li>
      <li>Straight razor or not, everyone nicks themselves at some point.  </li>
      <li>the stick just got blood on it, and the pencil didn&#x27;t really do anything to stop the bleeding.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works fast....</li>
      <li>Very little is needed for most nicks so they&#x27;ll probably last you a year or more, assuming you don&#x27;t severely gouge yourself every time you shave.</li>
      <li>I have no information about the product other than I liked the convenience of two unit packaging and the price beats the retail prices of local stores.</li>
      <li>so I figured it would not be worth sending it back.</li>

      <li>Small cuts easily get clogged up with styptic!  </li>
      <li>Quickly stopped the minor bleeding from a cut or abrasion.</li>
      <li>I have no idea, but they are an essential part of my first aid kit.</li>
      <li>In the old days of straight razors and single edge safety razor blade you were a bit more likely to get nicked and these things were necessary to have around.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellentl product. Quickly stopped the minor bleeding from a cut or abrasion.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> It works. Ouch. When you need to stop the bleeding.  I cut myself shaving on occasion and these things keep the bleeding stopped.  Simple and functional.  What a combination.</li>
    <li> The product was intact, which was great considering it was shipped in a bubble-envelope. I&#x27;d recommend the product; it works. I will say though that I&#x27;ve reveived and sent a LOT of FedEx-style mailings and never have I stuck the peel-off tape-paper strip into the envelope I was sending, nor had I previously received one. I know it&#x27;s not a big deal at all, but I was suprised that Cosmetic Solutions would send me a little bit of garbage along with the product I&#x27;d bought from them - price and product being the same, I&#x27;d buy from a different vendor next time.</li>
    <li> My  husband is always nicking himself when shaving .. and bleeding for hours.  So I did research on Amazon and found what I felt to be the best deal.  I think I found it!  Great product -- works instantly, and the shipping was prompt and packaging sufficiently  secure.  I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> Comes with two pens at a fair price I for one never used a styptic pencil in my life.  When you nick yourself shaving run the tip of the pen through water and rub the pencil on the nick.  You a bit of a sting but it stops the bleeding.  The pen does leave a bit of a white residue once it dries but it beats seeing blood.  The only down side is that the product does not have a storage container. Seeing that I don&#x27;t often nick myself shaving I see this product lasting quite a while.  But when I do run out I would most likely reorder.</li>
    <li> They stop the bleeding.</li>
    <li> I started wet-shaving about a year ago, and I wish I knew about these when I started.  They are an absolute necessity, they stop bleeding from cuts and nicks in seconds.  They sting like the dickens for an instant, but it is worth it to stop the blood nearly instantly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I never heard/used a styptic pencil in the previous 15 years of shaving, but I am glad I finally discovered it.  These pencils were inexpensive but very effective.  Small cuts easily get clogged up with styptic!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for stopping minor nicks, exactly as advertised. Not sure how it compares to other products, so I don&#x27;t know if it deserves 5 stars or not. Therefore, I gave it 4.</li>
    <li> It was my first time shaving with a straight razor so my face was the Niagra Falls of blood. So I wet this stuff and applied it like the Joker puts on makeup. It burned like crazy, as if it were made of tiny little pain robots, but the micro-ouch-bots had another plan for my face. They stopped the bleeding instantly and everything was superfly. This stuff rocks.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! Stops bleeding from small cuts and nicks pretty much instantly. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying these again if I need more. It does, however, sting a bit when you apply it, but don&#x27;t go running away from this product because of that, it&#x27;s a very minor sting.&lt;br /&gt;I give this product a 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt; Spence.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about these stypic pencils, but they work.  Very little is needed for most nicks so they&#x27;ll probably last you a year or more, assuming you don&#x27;t severely gouge yourself every time you shave.</li>
    <li> Learning to wet shave and nick myself sometimes. I usually just use a bit of toilet paper but when I don&#x27;t have time to let it clot naturally, I just use these guys.</li>
    <li> It is a little difficult to try to describe a product of this nature in twenty words, when you simply want to say, &amp;#34;It Works&amp;#34;!  Buying the double pack is going to give you enough of this product to last you for ten years, unless you are prone to cutting yourself every day.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I was using toilet paper all those years to treat nicks.&lt;br /&gt;A styptic pencil is remarkable in stopping the flow from my shaving mistakes&lt;br /&gt;This product is cheap and cheerful, compressed aluminum sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;Two sticks will last for ages.</li>
    <li> These work, but they disintegrate extremely quickly compared to others. I would not repurchase, but would go for another brand instead.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Good price and quality. Nothing works better for me.</li>
    <li> Try as I might, those nicks from my double edge razor are just a fact of life. These styptic pencils quickly stop the bleeding and get me on with my day. Try them and you too, will like them</li>
    <li> Bought this item because i was first starting out using a straight razor so i knew i was going to get a few cuts. These stpooed the bleeding right away!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works fast....convenient plastic carry case.  You get two!  Tough to find in local drugstores.. A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> These pencils do their job and do it well. The only complaint I have is the design. You are supposed to rinse the pencil before use and the water erodes that pencil pretty quickly. Will be looking for a different design next time – something like lipstick style.</li>
    <li> Nicks and minor cuts are caused all the time to men and women by razors and other cutting utensils. When bleeding does not stop quickly by itself, the situation--though not critical--is quite uncomfortable and often socially inconvenient. Yet there is a nifty little trick that, since the decline of straight razors, has been largely ignored by younger generations. I fell into that trap too, but during a recent house move I discovered in a box unopened for years a little product case entitled Styptic Pencil that I had once bought in New Jersey. The pencil inside was eroded but reminded me what a life-saver it was years ago. I tried to find a fresh product in drugstores but in vain. Searching it on Amazon led me to this product which I ordered immediately. It arrived quickly, I gave one pencil to my wife and I kept the other. Already we both had occasion to use them with great success, much to our relief.</li>
    <li> I chose the satisfactory rating of three stars as the product was for use by one of my sons. I have no information about the product other than I liked the convenience of two unit packaging and the price beats the retail prices of local stores.</li>
    <li> Styptic pencils work great as you can see by many reviews from all the guys out there selling them. So why buy from this guy? One bad review said they came broken. They must have learned from there errors because the way they packaged mine, there was no way it was going to break in shipping (a box with a sheet of cardboard sandwiching it against the side). Another said it crumbed. These pencils should last a lifetime if you take care of them unless maybe you are trying to learn how to straight razor shave with Parkinson&#x27;s. To make it last forever, first you need a fairly hard pencil. When you use them, only wet the tip. I make a small pool of water in my hand and rub the pencil in a very small area with moderate pressure. After the job is done let it dry completely before putting it in some kind of protective case to keep them from breaking. I keep mine in an old polaroid black and white fixer swiper thingy container (I bet only 1% of you remember them!). Either way the point is keep them dry in storage and only wet what you are going to use. For all of you making the transition from the extremely expensive mediocre Mach 3 blades to the exceptional shave you get with an old Gillette double edged razor or the even better shave you get with a straight razor this is an absolute must. Oh and by the way The Feather double edged razor blades are the sharpest on the planet.</li>
    <li> I am about to re-order these. I had them for over a year and they worked wonders on those nicks. They don&#x27;t happen often but when they do you&#x27;ll want the nick relief there.</li>
    <li> Does the job, does the job quick and well and the price is really good.  Try it and you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Clubman Woltra Styptic Pencils is a very good Product &amp; I will Recommended To Everyone I Know, And have them do the Same</li>
    <li> Does what I expect.  Nothing to love about them, but would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Quickly and mostly painlessly stop bleeding on nicks as you learn to shave. It never left any residue on me, it simply closed up the tiny nick and stopped the bleeding almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only stings a tiny bit and then quickly fades, unless you try to stop a cut on your lips. I nicked myself once right on the edge of my lip and using a Styptic pencil was not a good idea.</li>
    <li> I always heard about these thing and finally got them. Well worth it. It stops 95% of cuts instantly. A small sting is all. A must have for quick shave or to look great for a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Don&#x27;t drop them... They shatter like chalk would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RIP first pencil.</li>
    <li> I have tried finding styptic pencils at drugstores and other retail outlets. Most of the clerks have never heard of them. I have not cut myself since my purchase arrived but I am sure that they will stem to flow. I object strongly to your requirement for a minimum number of words. I do not always have time to reply and so I do not reply.</li>
    <li> It works!  Yes, it does leave some white residue, but that&#x27;s easily washed off.  If you nick yourself shaving, this will  stop the bleed.  Stings a little but I see that a sign that it&#x27;s working.  Lasts forever too.  Comes in a 2 pack, nice to have one at home and one in your travel kit.</li>
    <li> I have four young people that are fairly new to this shaving biz that are forever nicking their tender faces and legs. I know for the boys/men/boys that applying small pieces of toilet paper to their little wounds and wait for them to clot up is... let&#x27;s face it...a rite of passage and pretty effective but it can take a long time for the bleeding to stop. And it&#x27;s easy to forget that you have unsightly pieces of bloody tissue paper on your face before you walk out the door. Nothing ruins a first impression like bloody pieces of toilet paper plastered to your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple answer to treating and stopping the bleeding on minor shaving cuts is this little styptic pencil. There&#x27;s a lot of punch in one of these little pencils...the active ingredient is an astringent. Astringents constrict the tissues in your skin and coagulate and dry the blood in your cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this styptic pencil, just wet the tip a bit and press it against your nick for a few seconds. It stings a little, but the pain is worth it, as the bleeding will stop..</li>
    <li> These were thrown in the package by Amazon with several heavy items, shaving mugs and soap.  Well, now I have styptic crumbs instead of styptic pencils.  I guess if I cut myself shaving I can rub styptic crumbs into the bleeding wound. Thanks for a lousy job packing Amazon.</li>
    <li> These Styptic pencils have been around for decades. And, since I&#x27;ve gone back to using a DE razor I knew I&#x27;d probably be needing this these. I bought enough to last me the rest of my life. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately when I received this product both of the pencils were shattered and only a few fragments were salvageable. I was in need and luckily this item was very cheap so I figured it would not be worth sending it back. Overall this has been a terrible experience and I would say I got about 25 cents worth of styptic out of this order. Sure, the stuff works on small razer cuts, but I totally regret this order because all I have gained is some white chunks of crap that I need to keep track of before I order some more of this shit (from a different seller).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used a styptic pencil before. Since I&#x27;m a new convert to double-edge shaving, I figured I&#x27;d better get a styptic pencil \\&quot;just in case.\\&quot; Well just in case happened and the styptic pencil came to the rescue. You dip the end in water then touch it to the nick. There is a minor stinging sensation and the bleeding stops virtually instantly. Pretty amazing and for that I award it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly despite the fact that I ordered it during the holiday season and it does exactly what a styptic pencil is supposed to do. Will buy this product from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64 and my dad used this! The old brands that stick around are always the best, (unless they change!) I used Clubman back when I first began to shave (yes back in the stoned age --- mid 60s for you if you are under 60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran a fowl of a Feather blade (really good DE blades but very sharp!) I got in a hurry oops, bled like a stuck pig but no styptic pencil. Yeah, dumb mistake but I didn&#x27;t bleed to death but I was very embarrassed. So I went to Amazon and found this great stuff never shave DE unless ya got some Clubman!</li>
    <li> Not that impressed. It is worked ok on very small nicks but on bigger ones did not stop bleeding well</li>
    <li> I thought I would need this a lot with switching to a safety razor but I only used it once so far. It worked and now I love safety razors!!!</li>
    <li> While one does not get too many nicks with modern shaving razors and blades, sometimes you have a scratch or pimple or whatever on your skin which get scraped a little close.  One touch with these and you get a little sting and the blood stops.  In the old days of straight razors and single edge safety razor blade you were a bit more likely to get nicked and these things were necessary to have around.</li>
    <li> my dad used these when i was small for shaving nicks now I know why they work great</li>
    <li> Would give it a five, but nothing to carry it in, so I am using the original case for the pens. However, they work great.</li>
    <li> If you are learning to use a straight razor or are prone to nicking when shaving, this $5 purchase will make you very happy. Like a piece of dense dissolvable chalk, you just wet the tip and touch it to the nick. It&#x27;ll sting for a second but the salts will quickly seal up and dry the cut. Leaves a white residue behind so don&#x27;t smear it everywhere, just a few dabs on the cut does the trick.</li>
    <li> Quick fix for a little nicks.</li>
    <li> what can i say other than they work as they should. cant be without them now.</li>
    <li> We were looking for something exactly like this after my husband cut himself shaving on vacation and nothing seemed to stem the flow of blood.  We found these after we came home and they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> works great. easy to use</li>
    <li> Came quickly, and my boyfriend was excited, he hasn&#x27;t tried it yet but it should help with any cuts etc. he has van willabrands (blood disorder) so when he hurts himself this should help him stop bleeding faster.</li>
    <li> Great Product does what you want it to do.</li>
    <li> fortunately haven&#x27;t had to use this yet. bought it for wound treatment for diabetic.  recommended by the VA podiatrist. great</li>
    <li> My grandpa cut his face shaving and said that back in his day they used to have these nick-stop pencils. I went on amazon and found them for him. He loves them! I&#x27;m getting some for myself and my husband now! They&#x27;d be great for a medical kit, too!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Great product.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by the styptic pencils for shaving cuts</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go better than old school styptic pencils when you get a cut. These stop even the worst cuts when shaving; it will sting, but it is better than getting blood everywhere.</li>
    <li> Works and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I bought these pencils because I&#x27;d read that styptic pencils are a magical tool to stop shaving nicks from bleeding.  Well, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just this brand or what, but I found them completely ineffective.  When I rubbed them on my leg, it was like the stick just got blood on it, and the pencil didn&#x27;t really do anything to stop the bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to a different brand of razor, and luckily that did the trick -- no more nicks!  Which is good, because these pencils were a waste.</li>
    <li> Handy to have a styptic nearby just in case. I haven&#x27;t had to use it often but when I have it has saved the day and my shirt. Does what it should with no fuss.</li>
    <li> Straight razor or not, everyone nicks themselves at some point.  I grew up knowing nothing about styptic products and only learned about this in my research about straight razor shaving.  Until I found this styptic product, I&#x27;d always have these tabs of tissue paper stuck to the nicks while waiting for the natural blood clotting to occur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting a Merkur safety razor (as a first step toward straight razor shaving).  As expected in the transition from bank draining cartridges to more economical shaves, I ended up with a nick or two.  This styptic pencil, dabbed in water, then touched to the nick, sealed it up instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have for anyone who shaves.</li>
    <li> This product is typical of styptic pencils and there is no reason not to purchase if you&#x27;re in need of knick relief. Happy shaving!</li>
    <li> Styptic pencils sting a bit, but they work like a tiny, coagulating wand. What&#x27;s in these magic items? I have no idea, but they are an essential part of my first aid kit.</li>
    <li> Great for little nicks.</li>
    <li> Stops the bleeding of razor nicks quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a styptic pencil. It closes nicks and cuts, tightens the pores.</li>
    <li> love these things. they work exactly as advertised.  remember to dry them after use, though, as they&#x27;ll melt if left wet.</li>
    <li> This product was jut as advertised.  Day after receiving it, nicked myself, just a simple wet of the end and stick to the spot and the bleeding stop.  There was a minor sting from the styptic working but it did what it was supposed to.  Should last a very long time also.  This will prove very beneficial over it&#x27;s life.</li>
    <li> Remember that time you nicked yourself shaving cause you were in a hurry, then had to go out in public while battling a bleeding face wound? Yeah.... that doesn&#x27;t happen if you use these. It is like a magic cut eraser!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the occasional use of this product and it saves time when I am rushing which is also the  times I usually nick myself and have the use for the Styptic Pencil. Works well. Last well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had to use it just the once, but it works. Hopefully I&#x27;ll never have to use it again!</li>
    <li> Really needs to have a storage place or case built in. Once you open the package and get the stick wet and set it down when it dries it gets stuck to the counter...&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise works great for closing those annoying nicks while shaving. Stings a bit</li>
    <li> Since I shave practically my whole face and head I do slip occasionally and nothing ever stopped the bleeding like these little wonders. Why I waited so long to try them is my loss but no more.</li>
    <li> Stops bleeding from shaving lacerations right away.  Very pleased with product.  Saw it seal a bullet wound on an episode of Hawaii 50, so it must be a great product.</li>
