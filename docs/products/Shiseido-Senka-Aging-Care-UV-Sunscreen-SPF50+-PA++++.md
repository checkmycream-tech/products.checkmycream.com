      <li>While it does look super oily and shiny when applied, it absorbs quickly to a really nice matte-yet-dewy finish.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is good, it stays on my face for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Overall, good product!</li>
      <li>-Easy</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth and dries quickly</li>
      <li>It is so light.</li>
      <li>Feeling overwhelmed with lack of english description, search reddit there is a great subreddit - asian beauty, a great resource.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes a few minutes, up to 15 in my experience to settle in, once it does it is matte.&lt;br /&gt;Great PA rating making this sunscreen perfect for anti-aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This sunscreen goes on matte and feels velvety smooth.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight, nice finish.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has difficulty keeping a sunscreen habit – it makes my skin feel so wonderful that I actually look forward to putting it</li>
      <li>Two or three fingertip size portions is enough to cover all my face and parts of my neck, it&#x27;s great for getting the tops of my ears and my hairline, and absorbs quickly without a greasy feel.</li>
      <li>I love this product and will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
      <li>I have tried many Asian sunscreens and actually really liked this one to start.</li>
      <li>a little greasy,not very good</li>
      <li>Perfect consistency that&#x27;s not too thick or drippy.</li>
      <li>You may want to buy more than one at a time (assuming you like it as much as I do).</li>
      <li>This is a very cosmetically elegant sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It absorbs super quickly, which makes it easier to use the recommended 1/4 tsp.</li>
      <li>absorb quickly into my skin.</li>
      <li>you are looking (and struggling) to find a suitable and effective sunscreen I would highly recommend looking into Japanese and Korean brands.</li>
      <li>A great sunscreen for Dark skin people.</li>
      <li>On its own, it doesn&#x27;t dry into a matte finish, but into a light dewy glow.</li>
      <li>Because of the smaller size of the packaging, it is easy to carry with you in case you want to apply more when you are out during the day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing enough on its own to not need an additional moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The scent dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Asian skin care in general is worth looking in to- great formulations and affordable.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a pretty nice sunscreen.</li>
      <li>it feels light like a serum, sinks in very quickly( non of that ghastly feeling of dragging the sunscreen blob around your face trying to persuade it to sink in... ghaah), it has NO SMELL!</li>
      <li>While I liked both better than any of my American products, I definitely preferred this one!</li>
      <li>then I do my normal makeup thing (primer, concealer, bronzer and light finishing powder).</li>
      <li>Works great, no more sunburn for me HEHE</li>
      <li>It goes on clear, and applies easily.</li>
      <li>The tube holds a great amount of product that should last me about 2-3 months if used on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>Plus, you really can&#x27;t beat that protection by too much, while still being comfortable.</li>
      <li>Its very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on your face.</li>
      <li>Good protection but a little greasy/oily.</li>
      <li>so it does not dry you out (great for dry skin)</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time today</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t spend tons of time outdoors, so a morning application is all I need) and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I am extremely pleased and definitely recommend it.</li>
      <li>It has no white cast whatsoever, will not feel heavy or oily after absorbing, and is wonderfully moisturizing as well.</li>
      <li>I get from my Shiseido Hada Senka, compared to that sunscreen this is alot more viscous on initial application but</li>
      <li>I love that this sunscreen has no white cast to it.</li>
      <li>but so far the texture of it is quite lightweight and comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>I was using Biore Sarasara UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence, but it was far too drying for my skin.  </li>
      <li>seems to dry quicker and to a more matte finish.</li>
      <li>I find as long as its above my eyebrows and a good inch away on the sides, I experience no burning.</li>
      <li>Not sure if the coverage is as good as other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past, but this one is perfect under makeup and never streaks.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the classic sun screen smell that turns people away from using sunscreen too!</li>
      <li>It also moisturizes really well.</li>
      <li>biggest issue with this sunscreen is that is really burns my eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is awesome sunscreen.  No problem getting the standard amount on your face: soaks in quick and leaves no white residue.  I&#x27;m sold for life.</li>
    <li> absorb quickly into my skin. I have oily skin and I feel nothing on my skin... no greasing feeling. It  does its jobs and feel like it was not even on my skin. Japanese sunscreens rock!!</li>
    <li> Goods have been received, very like, thank you</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer/sunscreen. It is so light. This is the only moisturizer I use before I apply my makeup. I think there is a slight white cast to the skin on flash photography but nothing terrible obvious. I love this product and will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Love it. It goes on smooth, no white cast and not overly fragrant. Def recommend!</li>
    <li> Good texture, didn&#x27;t ball up over my creams and serums. Haven&#x27;t tested all day outdoor conditions to see if it prevented pigmentation protection though.</li>
    <li> Love it....best sunscreen</li>
    <li> I have tried many Asian sunscreens and actually really liked this one to start. This is a larger bottle than most other sunscreens come in. It has a thicker consistency then an essence but isn&#x27;t quiet as thick as a gel. It comes out white and has a low, flowery sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;While the product comes out white, there is absolutely no white cast.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few minutes, up to 15 in my experience to settle in, once it does it is matte.&lt;br /&gt;Great PA rating making this sunscreen perfect for anti-aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with this sunscreen is that is really burns my eyes. I work in an air conditioned office where I sit all day and it still runs into my eyes. I wear contacts so this may effect how long the sunscreen burns my eyes once it migrates in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t necessarily blame this sunscreen for the &#x27;running into eyes&#x27; issue. A lot of chemical (not titanium dioxide or zinc oxide) sunscreens suffer the same down fall. To get around this, I put a physical sunscreen around my eyes and this sunscreen everywhere else. I find as long as its above my eyebrows and a good inch away on the sides, I experience no burning.</li>
    <li> Works great, no more sunburn for me HEHE</li>
    <li> Not sure if the coverage is as good as other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used in the past, but this one is perfect under makeup and never streaks.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great matte sunscreen. I put it on every day under my makeup!</li>
    <li> Very lightweight, nice finish. A bit moist/shiny when applied heavily, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> Very greasy and tacky feeling after application, it doesn&#x27;t dry down to a smooth consistency.</li>
    <li> This is a nice sunscreen. It works perfect and brightens up the skin.</li>
    <li> I used it for the first time today and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not exactly hydrating but it sinks right into the skin in a matter of seconds. I can&#x27;t tell how effective it is in protecting my face against the harsh sunlight here but so far the texture of it is quite lightweight and comfortable to wear. The consistency is neither too thick nor too thin and I only need about 2 pea-sized drops to cover my whole face. The tube holds a great amount of product that should last me about 2-3 months if used on a daily basis. The plastic material of the tube, though, is really soft and rubbery almost like you&#x27;re holding a water balloon in your hand. It feels funny but not really a bother. I think I need to mix it with a moisturizer since it&#x27;s not enough to keep my sensitive/dry skin hydrated throughout the day. Overall, good product!</li>
    <li> Matte finish, no white residue.  I have oily skin, and this did not make me oilier, nor shiny.  It doesn&#x27;t break me out.  Heard about this on SkinCareAddiction.  My new under-makeup sunscreen.  It&#x27;s not waterproof, so it&#x27;s not really meant to stay on if its hot and humid, and you&#x27;re rushing about outside.  I have other outdoor and sport sunscreens I wear.</li>
    <li> A great sunscreen for Dark skin people. Its very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on your face.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is good, it stays on my face for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. When you first put it on, it will feel heavy and oily, but after 20-30 minutes, the shine dries to a very natural, soft finish. It has no white cast whatsoever, will not feel heavy or oily after absorbing, and is wonderfully moisturizing as well. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to wear an additional moisturizer under this. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat that PA++++ protection! Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> No white cast. Not oily. It did not break me out.</li>
    <li> Great product. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast like so many other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Excellent sun protection, no white cast, gel formula so it does not dry you out (great for dry skin), you need to wait ten minutes before applying makeup however.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. It goes on clear, and applies easily. It is a little pricey, which is the only reason why I hesitate to purchase again.</li>
    <li> a little greasy,not very good</li>
    <li> Spreads easily, great protection, no strange odor, and great moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency makes it so you only really need a little bit for your whole face. I don&#x27;t have to smell like I&#x27;m going to the beach (even if I am going to the beach).</li>
    <li> Non-drying, sinks right in, wonderful makeup base. I love that it has urea so it also moisturizes!</li>
    <li> I was using Biore Sarasara UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence, but it was far too drying for my skin.  This has been a great alternative; it is lightly moisturizing and I am confident in its sun protection.  Sometimes I suspect it of peeling, but it may be that my face is just flaking from the exfoliating products I use at night.  I will continue to use this product until further notice.  It is light, has strong sun protection, wears nicely under makeup, and is not too drying.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic sunscreen, it fits my lifestyle perfectly (I don&#x27;t spend tons of time outdoors, so a morning application is all I need) and is exactly what I was looking for. While it does look super oily and shiny when applied, it absorbs quickly to a really nice matte-yet-dewy finish. I usually put it on after my moisturizer has dried, but if it&#x27;s not a super dry day, I can skip the Cerave since the sunscreen moisturizes pretty well on it&#x27;s own~ Also, I&#x27;m really happy that it doesn&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;ve slathered myself with sunscreen hours afterward! The scent dissipates pretty quickly. :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love! It&#x27;s a little more pricey than other options you can find in the U.S., but it&#x27;s just so much nicer than the heavy sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it&#x27;s worth to me. Will definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Too greasy for me, even though I have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Good protection but a little greasy/oily.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is amazing! It feels like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried from a sunscreen range of products. Now I am convinced that east asian beauty and skin care market is WAY ahead of US and Europe.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried sunscreens of many flavors - chemical, micronized zinc, cheap, very expensive, prestige european brands and they all were just meeah, an OK at best.&lt;br /&gt;This is so different - it feels light like a serum, sinks in very quickly( non of that ghastly feeling of dragging the sunscreen blob around your face trying to persuade it to sink in... ghaah), it has NO SMELL! and no white cast at any point. I can actually be honest with myself and say that I do put the recommended 1/4tsp of this sunscreen on my face every day. On my combo skin it does go on looking a bit shiny but it all settles in to a velvety finish in about 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking (and struggling) to find a suitable and effective sunscreen I would highly recommend looking into Japanese and Korean brands. Asian skin care in general is worth looking in to- great formulations and affordable. Feeling overwhelmed with lack of english description, search reddit there is a great subreddit - asian beauty, a great resource.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing sunscreen! It dries completely clear, and makes my skin feel soft! Plus, you really can&#x27;t beat that protection by too much, while still being comfortable.</li>
    <li> If delivers what it promises to be dull skin. We recommend</li>
    <li> I heard of this product on reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction, it also appears on reddit.com/r/asianbeauty. Reasons to buy? the lowest white cast you can get with sunscreen, and also the lowest greasy feel you can get with sunscreen. The smell isn&#x27;t the classic sun screen smell that turns people away from using sunscreen too! Which is a small plus. I personally don&#x27;t care but others might. Unless I miraculously find a better one, I won&#x27;t be using any other sunscreen for my face.</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, one of the most pleasant sunscreens I have ever used, and believe me, there have been a lot!  It feels silky when applied, and my skin continues feeling that way all day.  Makeup can be applied over it without the dreaded pilling caused by so many sunscreens.  It contains effective ingredients which have been used safely for many years in Europe.  Because of the smaller size of the packaging, it is easy to carry with you in case you want to apply more when you are out during the day.  I am extremely pleased and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good smell, soaks in eventually. Takes a long time in the recommended amount on my skin, but worth it.</li>
    <li> Living is a sub-tropical environment and spending as much time outdoors means total protection from the sun is part of getting ready in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;After my skincare regimen I apply a thick layer of this on my face, neck and decolletage. It takes about 15 minutes to absorb then I do my normal makeup thing (primer, concealer, bronzer and light finishing powder). I used Shiseido Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen for years even tho it caused redness (that went away) at first however I have no irritation whatsoever with this very elegant and effective formulation. I carry a tube in my purse and I have one in my car - even my hands do not freckle!</li>
    <li> I ordered this sunscreen in order to get a bump up on the normal level of sun protection I get from my Shiseido Hada Senka, compared to that sunscreen this is alot more viscous on initial application but seems to dry quicker and to a more matte finish. My skin did seem to react more to this in the form of a teeny tiny bit of acne (like 2 tiny clogged pores) but everyone is different. Overall this is a pretty nice sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Just started using it.  It seem to keep my skin moist, but I don&#x27;t know it works if I do more outdoor activities yet in the summer.  I also wish English version of the ingredients were provided  I&#x27;d like to know what I put on my face.  I purchased the product because of it&#x27;s reasonable price, and Shiseido is a well-known brand that&#x27;s been around for decades,</li>
    <li> I love that this sunscreen has no white cast to it. It&#x27;s consistency is very light, yet it is hydrating &amp; moisturizing. The moisturizing effects last through the day, which is really saying something cause I have normal to dry skin. It blends well with make up. Not like other sunscreens that turn gunky / cakes. On its own, it doesn&#x27;t dry into a matte finish, but into a light dewy glow. I use it as the last step in my day regimen. (Cleanse-tone-essence-serum-eye cream-all over moisturizer). You really don&#x27;t need to use a separate moisturizer when using this Shiseido sunscreen. I just do it now because my skin is recovering from neglect &amp; I&#x27;ve started the multiple step Korean beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is awesome. It dries quickly and leaves no white cast. Best yet, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. I am extremely happy with it.</li>
    <li> HG status! It&#x27;s creamy when first applied but dries to a matte in a few minutes. Will definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> I have sensitive combination skin and a pale complexion. In the summer, that usually means heat rashes (even on my face) and burning as easily as a marshmallow. I&#x27;ve found most sunscreens, even Neutrogena, to be too thick for my skin--which usually flakes shortly after application. This stuff however, has got me using sunscreen again on a daily basis. Two or three fingertip size portions is enough to cover all my face and parts of my neck, it&#x27;s great for getting the tops of my ears and my hairline, and absorbs quickly without a greasy feel. The smell is the traditional summery sunscreen smell, but very minimal. I&#x27;m using it almost, but not quite daily before I go out for my lunchtime walks and feel it has made a huge difference in the quality of my skin as compared to previous summers. If you burn easily, and are reluctant to use any products on your skin--this is probably a good fit for you. Full disclosure, I don&#x27;t wear make up, so sunscreen and moisturizer is all I use on a regular basis, I can&#x27;t attest to how it does under or over make-up. ***Update for customers that need the info, I have Seb.Derm. and this works well for me without excess irritation.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen goes on matte and feels velvety smooth. I absolutely love it and wear it every day beneath makeup or barefaced. It&#x27;s a small tube but with daily wear I&#x27;m still going strong. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t plan to use it on my body though, it wouldn&#x27;t go very far. Remember, you should be using a 1/4 teaspoon on your face for appropriate coverage - it&#x27;s more than you think!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen, here&#x27;s why: -It is moisturising yet non greasy (this sunscreen absorbs nicely into your skin. This does not leave a shiny &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on your face) -Consistency wise, this is somewhere in between a lotion and a creme. Perfect consistency that&#x27;s not too thick or drippy. -No scent! -High UV protection factors. SPF 50+, PA ++++ (a Japanese equivalent of PPD 16+) -No white/blue/grey/unwanted cast. This is a very cosmetically elegant sunscreen. -Easy removal with regular facial cleanser (I don&#x27;t sweat a lot, but if you do, it could be a problem.) -This sunscreen is extremely effective! And it&#x27;s affordable. -Cute design :)</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the Hada Lobo UV creamy gel in an ongoing effort to find my favorite sunscreen. While I liked both better than any of my American products, I definitely preferred this one! It absorbs super quickly, which makes it easier to use the recommended 1/4 tsp. It has a nice matte finish and makes my skin feel smooth and satiny, almost like a very fine powder. It&#x27;s moisturizing enough on its own to not need an additional moisturizer. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has difficulty keeping a sunscreen habit – it makes my skin feel so wonderful that I actually look forward to putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution though, it is a pretty small tube compared to most american products. You may want to buy more than one at a time (assuming you like it as much as I do).</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! I was looking for a sunscreen for the harsh Texas sun that works under my make-up and I found this. It goes on very smooth and dries quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait long to put on my make-up. It also moisturizes really well. I sometimes have dry patches on areas of my face while other areas are oily. This sunscreen gives me the moisture I need and sunscreen combined. It worked so well, I stopped using a separate moisturizer. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is amazing Sunscreen. Vastly superor to its american counterparts. This sinks into your skin very fast and leaves no white cast, it is also moisturizing, which helps me since most sunscreens dry out my skin.</li>
