    <li> This was a gift for my dad. I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne on him!</li>

    <li> I really like this cologne as it is masculine without being overpowering and does last a long while</li>
    <li> I have used this Grey Flannel in the past and I continue to be very satisfied. I think it ranks with some of the more expensive colognes...but that&#x27;s just me..*)</li>
    <li> It is a great product and all the males in the family likes it.  I strongly recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> A complete blast from the past. I remember my first bottle, had it when I joined the military. Just on a whim I picked up a bottle of the EDT recently ( some 20+ years later) and hoped it would not end up being some regrettable choice....like English Leather, or BRUT!&lt;br /&gt;Just a little dab was enough to do my part in keeping the airspace a bit nicer on those tightly packed tin cans we call aircraft. It will blend nicely into a formulation of your own body chemistry and as far as I can tell won&#x27;t turn noses away. I had a couple of compliments and inquiries of what it was. Definitely one of the choices I&#x27;ve made that ended up on the up side of the experience meter. Give it a try, or reacquaint!</li>
