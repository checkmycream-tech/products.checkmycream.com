### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Fits the Wahl Echo Cord/Cordless Trimmer perfectly!</li>
      <li>These guides just make it great!</li>
      <li>Best trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>The quality is good, and they were delivered on time as promised at a great value!</li>
      <li>Great replacement for my Peanut&#x27;s comb extensions.  </li>
      <li>Happy to have found the attachments for my Wahl trimmer.  </li>
      <li>i was so happy to find replacements.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for carrying them.</li>
      <li>my father loved this product and when one of the attachments&lt;br /&gt;chipped</li>
      <li>These fit my Wahl Peanut trimmer perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Good buy, good product, no complaints, does the trick.</li>
      <li>so I bought this set which fit perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Fit my Mag trimmer perfect.</li>
      <li>It fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>so it would have been nicer to have a greater variety of blade guard lengths, but they clip in nicely and work great.</li>
      <li>This kit provides better replacement combs for my Peanut than the ones that came with the trimmer.</li>
      <li>Yea they are cheap plastic</li>
      <li>I think it is kind of wasteful for me to have to buy a full set of combs when only one is needed, and it would be nice if they were built of sturdier material or a stronger design.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I needed!  </li>
      <li>fit our clipper very well.</li>
      <li>This kit works perfectly fine with my older Wahl trimmer for my beard.  </li>
      <li>The set I received was black instead of white, but they fit and work perfectly on my almost 20 year old Wahl Peanut trimmer.</li>
      <li>but they have not failed me yet.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the fast delivery and quality.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Quality seems very high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, in a look around online it seems that Wahl is based in Sterling, IL, and does have an older product of the &amp;#34;Sterling 2 plus&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The teeth and particularly the ones on each edge break with almost no effort.</li>
      <li>a little flimsy but ok</li>
      <li>pefect fit for wahl sterling trimmer (black version)</li>
      <li>Actual Wahl brand, worth the extra couple of bucks to me relative to the other non-Wahl available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I currently have a bag full of the bigger combs from all of the multiple sets I have had to buy over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shipping is always fast and other than my dogs finding the trimmers and chewing them up, these combs are durable for the job they were designed for (not as doggy chew toys).</li>

    <li> Fits the Wahl Echo Cord/Cordless Trimmer perfectly!</li>
    <li> a little flimsy but ok</li>
    <li> Buy them together. Best trimmer I have ever owned. These guides just make it great! Yea they are cheap plastic but they have not failed me yet.</li>
    <li> Happy to have found the attachments for my Wahl trimmer.  Thanks for the fast delivery and quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a replacement for guards that I had lost.  These fit my Wahl Peanut trimmer perfectly.  The quality is good, and they were delivered on time as promised at a great value!</li>
    <li> Good buy, good product, no complaints, does the trick. Get them. You won&#x27;t be sorry at all. They work well.</li>
    <li> Just like the originals.</li>
    <li> Fit my Mag trimmer perfect. Fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed!  It fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> I usually only break the 1/8 inch cut comb, because that&#x27;s the one I use almost exclusively for beard trimming. The teeth and particularly the ones on each edge break with almost no effort. I think it is kind of wasteful for me to have to buy a full set of combs when only one is needed, and it would be nice if they were built of sturdier material or a stronger design. I currently have a bag full of the bigger combs from all of the multiple sets I have had to buy over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on Wahl&lt;br /&gt;Do me a favor and offer them individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Gestner</li>

    <li> I am using it for beard trimming so it would have been nicer to have a greater variety of blade guard lengths, but they clip in nicely and work great.</li>
    <li> The set I received was black instead of white, but they fit and work perfectly on my almost 20 year old Wahl Peanut trimmer.</li>

    <li> This kit works perfectly fine with my older Wahl trimmer for my beard.  My only knock against the product was that the package in which it arrived had no &amp;#34;Wahl&amp;#34; branding on it at all.  It just said &amp;#34;Sterling 2 plus&amp;#34; and on the back of the tag had the company name of &amp;#34;Sterling&amp;#34; based in Sterling, IL.  I thought I was being sent a different product from what I ordered... and was concerned about whether it was designed to work with my Wahl trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in a look around online it seems that Wahl is based in Sterling, IL, and does have an older product of the &amp;#34;Sterling 2 plus&amp;#34;.  Presumably the packaging is just a result of changes in branding within their various product lines.  It just made for a confusing consumer experience because there was no sign that this was the &amp;#34;Wahl Comb Kit&amp;#34; that I thought I had ordered.</li>
    <li> Actual Wahl brand, worth the extra couple of bucks to me relative to the other non-Wahl available on Amazon.  My only objection is with Amazon because it took a bit of digging to find this one but all&#x27;s well that ends well.</li>
    <li> This kit provides better replacement combs for my Peanut than the ones that came with the trimmer. The shipping is always fast and other than my dogs finding the trimmers and chewing them up, these combs are durable for the job they were designed for (not as doggy chew toys).</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my Peanut&#x27;s comb extensions.  My #1 had a bunch of teeth broken off so I bought this set which fit perfectly.  Quality seems very high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only odd thing about the set was that mine came in black.  The color was not important to me but if you want the matching white then you may want to order with some caution.</li>
