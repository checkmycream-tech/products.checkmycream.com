    <li> This blue is a very pretty color. It is very opaque and doesn&#x27;t need a lot of coats for full coverage.

    <li> If you need to get this anytime soon, the don&#x27;t order it from here! I ordered this nail polish on the 11th of November and got it on the 23rd. It was only supposed to take 5 days. First they lost it, then they said they shipped it and it took more than a week. The product is good and true to the picture, but the company didn&#x27;t help me at all. And when I asked for them to keep it and give me a refund, they ignored my question. So if you don&#x27;t mind waiting, then get it from here, but if you want good customer service and to get it quickly, buy this from another company.</li>
    <li> Very pretty color, vey matte. It&#x27;s a little on the thick side, but it&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s too hard to work with. Goes perfectly with a dress that I just bought! Great pedicure color!!!</li>

    <li> Love this nail polish, I normally never liked colors like this, but really like it!! I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t cover well, but to my surprised it pretty much covered in one coat! I still put 2 coats on and I added a decal to one of my nails. I put some pictures up to see the color. I also bought 2 other colors in the china glaze, haven&#x27;t gotten them yet.</li>
