      <li>Perfect for when you want a close shave but don&#x27;t want to spend very much time.  </li>
      <li>A good brush - My 1st brush was a $6 boar brush from CVS and to be honest I was able to build a good head of lather with it.</li>
      <li>This is an attractive, well-made razor that delivers a close, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>They are great at telling and showing what to do, and just as importantly, what NOT to do.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s also nice</li>

      <li>After you own one, nothing comes close.</li>

      <li>Very easy to switch blades out.</li>
      <li>This old style safety razor is AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>Great razor, still looking for the right blade.</li>
      <li>An excellent razor at a mid price....</li>
      <li>:) looking for what I wanted.</li>
      <li>but this R89 Grande from Muhle should be on top of your list..</li>
      <li>I was able to use it.  </li>
      <li>The end of the screw still stuck in the handle did not look like steel and more like pot metal.</li>
      <li>the course of that year I had an enjoyable experience.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the shave every time, nice razor for the price.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s better razor out there, like the Edwin Jager or</li>
      <li>I have found some blades better than others in this razor.</li>
      <li>I now have an interchangeable system if I want to experiment with a more aggressive head, though the truth is the R89 is all anyone would need.  </li>
      <li>I agonized quite a bit over different DE razors before settling on this one, and I&#x27;m very happy with my choice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>is that I&#x27;ve been able to get the R41 head, which is more aggressive, so</li>
      <li>I received a Merkur slant razor for my birthday, and the Muhle works better for me.</li>
      <li>I have been using the R89 for about a month now, and it is outstanding - forgiving, very close and great looking.</li>
      <li>DE shaving takes more time and care but it turns something that was once a chore into an epicurean experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>On my first try with a safety razor and had ZERO nicks or cuts!!!  </li>
      <li>I have to use a bit more care than with a cartridge, but I find I enjoy the experience much more than I did before.  </li>
      <li>The head twists off/opens easily for blade replacement...</li>
      <li>This is my first safety razor it has a nice feel to it, the wight and size is a combination.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of the extra weight, the workmanship is impeccable and it is a pleasure using this...</li>
      <li>The perfect amount takes time to learn... too little</li>
      <li>The perfect amount takes time to learn... too little</li>
      <li>That is a huge savings through out your lifetime.</li>
      <li>I do worry a bit that the screw on the head may crack if the razor is dropped but the head cap can be replaced fairly cheaply if this</li>
      <li>It is even easy to clean and replace the razors.  </li>
      <li>Very forgiving and effective razor</li>
      <li>Gives a smooth comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>At the most, it&#x27;s worth 9.99.  </li>
      <li>High quality, nice weight.</li>
      <li>After I was done shaving today, I took it apart to clean it like I always do.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the shave and the way it feels in my hand, absolutely no worries in the shower, cleans easily and quickly and looks great with the brush and stand I bought.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to get much closer shaves than with a cartridge razor using a three-pass shave.  </li>
      <li>This is the case with most safety razors aside from stainless steel.  </li>
      <li>They do a great job giving you a close shave, but that is because the included razor blade is extremely sharp.</li>
      <li>Razor burn will be a little more noticeable for the first week, so get a good aftershave balm (lotion), and use a lot of it to moisturize &amp; sooth your face.  </li>

      <li>I will say that I did get a better shave with the Muhle and the Art of Shaving sampler, than I did using some Old Spice Shave cream....  </li>
      <li>Bought this item in December 2012 after deciding that I wanted to go more \\&quot;old</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a good web site that provides a lot of helpful information on wet shaving ([...])</li>
      <li>Findng the right combination of razor and blade may take awhile depending on your hair type and skin.</li>
      <li>It costs a few bucks more, but I can see why those that use it use nothing else :)</li>
      <li>And being that it is full metal, when rinsing with hot water, it will conduct the heat extremely fast.</li>
      <li>One very minor thing -- it would be good PR to include a blade with a new razor.</li>
      <li>I was terrified the first two times I used this razor.  </li>
      <li>Of course..every person&#x27;s beard is different,and requires different technique :)..</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found compact razors are a lot better than larger ones because of the handling and weight</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>This is such an under rated razor, I absolutely love this thing.</li>
      <li>Good shave for the few times</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and did a lot of research before selecting the Muhle R89 Grande, which is an excellent razor for wet shaving newbies.</li>
      <li>Doing so will get your face ready for the slightly more aggressive blade, and the inevitable burn wrought by your unpracticed hand.  </li>
      <li>) The handle offers a surprisingly good grip when your fingers are wet.  </li>
      <li>The $35 Merkur might actually be a better value, but the Muhle is nice if you can justify the extra few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After a week of shaving I upgraded to a Badger brush (Pure).</li>
      <li>Also, THE CHROME IS STILL LIKE NEW !!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Big, ugly, and not worth it.  At the most, it&#x27;s worth 9.99.  There&#x27;s better razor out there, like the Edwin Jager or Samurai 202.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found compact razors are a lot better than larger ones because of the handling and weight distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.  All razors are the same, exposing the same amount of razor through the head.  Now it comes down to grip, size, weight, and coating of nickel or chrome.  That&#x27;s all you&#x27;re paying for.  The cut is all the same because of the blades.</li>
    <li> I agonized quite a bit over different DE razors before settling on this one, and I&#x27;m very happy with my choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;89&amp;#34;-style head is shared with the Edwin Jagger DE89 and shaves exceptionally well.  The only difference between this and the EJ DE89 is the &amp;#34;grande&amp;#34; handle, which is larger and a bit heavier (though hollow), but very well balanced and proportioned. I&#x27;ve had no problem with the handle being slippery when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s also nice is that I&#x27;ve been able to get the R41 head, which is more aggressive, so I now have an interchangeable system if I want to experiment with a more aggressive head, though the truth is the R89 is all anyone would need.  (I have heard/read that the handle is made of brass, while the head is zinc-based &amp;#34;pot metal.&amp;#34;  This is the case with most safety razors aside from stainless steel.  I do worry a bit that the screw on the head may crack if the razor is dropped but the head cap can be replaced fairly cheaply if this happens.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a good blade I&#x27;m able to get much closer shaves than with a cartridge razor using a three-pass shave.  The money saved on razorblades more than pays for the razor itself, and a good soap like Cella, RazorRock, Proraso, etc. will last much longer than canned shaving cream.  I have to use a bit more care than with a cartridge, but I find I enjoy the experience much more than I did before.  I would equate DE shaving to making your own espresso while cartridge razors are like brewing Folger&#x27;s crystals or Sanka.  DE shaving takes more time and care but it turns something that was once a chore into an epicurean experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful I don&#x27;t have to pay $28 for a handful of plastic cartridges that can only be used a few times and then clog a landfill.  Anyone who wants to can buy 100 Personna blades and a kg brick of Cella, which is both incredibly cheap (several years&#x27; supply of blades + soap will run you about $50), and involves almost no plastic waste at all.  Hopefully we&#x27;ll soon see shaving go through the same renaissance that coffee went through 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would encourage anyone on the fence about DE shaving to give it a try.tic waste at all.

    <li> Great razor, still looking for the right blade.</li>
    <li> I agree with Mr. Buslon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to switch from disposables to the DE razor, but spent 2 weeks checking the available models on Amazon as well as a few other sites (thanks BADGERANDBLADE.com :) looking for what I wanted. I finally visited The Art of Shaving store locally and checked out a few razors ... and this one felt great in the hand. Well balanced, well designed &amp; constructed, and beautifully chromed. It costs a few bucks more, but I can see why those that use it use nothing else :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 9/4/15 - I have been using this razor for 2 years now, and I must say I still love it !! I received a Merkur slant razor for my birthday, and the Muhle works better for me. Also, THE CHROME IS STILL LIKE NEW !! I am amazed that after using it daily for 2 years that it is still in new condition !! Very comfortable to use, excellent balance, and durable.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor.  Thats all I can say about it.</li>
    <li> I use a muhle r89 and a seki feather in addition to this razor.  I think the extra weight definitely helps as I found the r89 a little too light and short handled at times espeically if your&#x27;re shaving more than your face (legs, arm pits, arms etc).  Gives a smooth comfortable shave.  I have used with several different blades:  feather, silver blue, astra, persona.  Highly recommend .</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research and read about how other major brands have defects despite costing over $200 per razor. When I found this online, it looks simple yet substantial. I am so happy with it, I bought another one for my brother. The only caveat is that it is slightly heavy (hence the 4 stars). And being that it is full metal, when rinsing with hot water, it will conduct the heat extremely fast. However, it feels very sturdy, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the head falling off on the long run. One reminder about these safety razors. They do a great job giving you a close shave, but that is because the included razor blade is extremely sharp. That said, drawing at the wrong angle may give you a cut. Otherwise, it is a nice razor to own.</li>
    <li> This is my first safety razor it has a nice feel to it, the wight and size is a combination.</li>
    <li> Good shave for the few times I was able to use it.  It is an incredibly fragile shaver.  Do not let this shaver fall from any height.  Mine fell and immediately broke into pieces.  The threaded post on the head just sheared like it was made of porcelain, not steel.  That&#x27;s $65 plus shipping just flushed down the toilet :(</li>
    <li> Fantastic razor, perfect sized, great feel, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I was comparing Edwin Jagger and Murkur for a while and was back and forth with the science of the Murkur and the art of the Edwin.&lt;br /&gt;Az you can see the German engineering and the machine marks on the Murkur and the chroming detail of the English Edwin.While researching which one to get it was like 6 of one half dozen of the other kind of like wanting the art or science, someone mentioned throwing the Muhle into the mix.&lt;br /&gt; The Muhle is a purphict combo of both. Soon az I looked at the Muhle the decision was clear to get the Muhle.&lt;br /&gt;Without hesitation I ordered the Muhle Grande which I ordered on a Friday afternoon and received Monday morning. Have nothing bad to say about the purchase or the seller. Purphict score.</li>
    <li> My second one to use for travelling. After you own one, nothing comes close.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the shave and the way it feels in my hand, absolutely no worries in the shower, cleans easily and quickly and looks great with the brush and stand I bought.</li>
    <li> This is an attractive, well-made razor that delivers a close, comfortable shave. The extra girth and weight take some getting used to, but to me the weight helps me keep a light, even touch. The $35 Merkur might actually be a better value, but the Muhle is nice if you can justify the extra few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original order was severely damaged in transit due to improper packaging and gross mistreatment by USPS, but the vendor replaced it right away (with much better packaging) at no cost or hassle to me. One very minor thing -- it would be good PR to include a blade with a new razor. Just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have been using D/E razors for about 18 months, so have mastered my technique reasonably well with a Merkur Futur. I have been using the R89 for about a month now, and it is outstanding - forgiving, very close and great looking. I has replaced the Futur as my daily go-to razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and did a lot of research before selecting the Muhle R89 Grande, which is an excellent razor for wet shaving newbies. I recieved my razor about a 2 weeks ago and have used it for my daily shaves. The quality of the razor is excellent. Findng the right combination of razor and blade may take awhile depending on your hair type and skin. I&#x27;m a Black man with sensitive skin and settled on the Blue Personna Israeli Double Edge Razor Blades (I recommend getting a sample pack-the Muhle comes with 1 Derby Extra blade). This combination has given me the best shave of my life, but to get a nice close shave without nicks, burns or irritation I would recommend the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use a pre-shave oil (I didn&#x27;t buy anything fancy - used virgin olive oil)&lt;br /&gt;2. A good brush - My 1st brush was a $6 boar brush from CVS and to be honest I was able to build a good head of lather with it. After a week of shaving I upgraded to a Badger brush (Pure). You can spend a lot of money on Badger brushes and selecting a grade of badger hair can be confusing. I spent $55 (bought from Art of Shaving)&lt;br /&gt;3. A good cream or soap&lt;br /&gt;4. A good after-shave balm to re-hydrate your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a good web site that provides a lot of helpful information on wet shaving ([...])</li>
    <li> Highest quality...did a lot of online research before deciding on the Muhle 89.  Feels good in the hand and very safe.  The head twists off/opens easily for blade replacement...sometimes it comes loose when you&#x27;re shaving but not much of a problem.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Read a lot of reviews, did a lot of research, and watched some on youtube.  Decided on this one because of great reviews.  Happy that I did.  I love the feel of the extra weight, the workmanship is impeccable and it is a pleasure using this...Tonight I use some of the sample set from The Art Of Shaving, the pre-shave oil, the shaving cream and the after shave lotion.  I will say that I did get a better shave with the Muhle and the Art of Shaving sampler, than I did using some Old Spice Shave cream....  The razor did arrive when it was supposed to too.  Now I am waiting for a brush from Edwin Jager, the 3ej257lds which is at a great sale price on here.  Last night picked up a tub of shaving cream, Art of Shaving, at Macy&#x27;s.  Everything is coming together...  An excellent razor at a mid price....&lt;br /&gt;Made in Germany too.... NOT China...</li>
    <li> I purchased this as my first wet shaver. I am very happy with the quality and weight. It is solid. I have found some blades better than others in this razor.</li>
    <li> I have big hands, so the weight and length fit me very well.  Enjoy the shave every time, nice razor for the price.</li>
    <li> a really good razor. the weight helps it sail through your beard. The blade it comes with is lousey and gave me a terrible and painful shave</li>
    <li> I was terrified the first two times I used this razor.  Visions of spiral-sliced ham filled my head, especially after reading the apocalyptic owner&#x27;s manual.  Nonetheless, I found my courage after watching some on-line videos about how to &amp;#34;shave like your grandpa,&amp;#34; and yes, even the owner&#x27;s manual had some good tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result:  BEST SHAVE EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving for nearly 30 years, and I&#x27;ve always had a problem getting a close shave in a narrow strip just under my jawline running from each ear toward my chin.  I&#x27;ve used a multitude of cartridge razors with single through five blades, disposables, and a variety of electrics... nothing worked.  I came to believe getting a good shave along those two strips was simply impossible.  To my surprise, this razor has conquered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about a week to really get the hang of shaving with this razor, but it&#x27;s not too different from wet shaving with a cartridge razor.  Here are some insights &amp; tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The handle offers a surprisingly good grip when your fingers are wet.  Dry fingers make the handle feel a little slippery, but don&#x27;t be fooled.  Your fingers will be wet while shaving, and this thing feels solid in my hand.  Also, the weight / heft is nice.  That&#x27;s why I chose the R89 Grande.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Watch on-line videos... several of them!!!  They are great at telling and showing what to do, and just as importantly, what NOT to do.  Also, read up about different types of blades.  Some are &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; blades, whereas others are ninja sharp for &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; only.  Additionally, READ the owner&#x27;s manual, because it&#x27;s possible to assemble the razor with one of the pieces upside-down, and doing so will throw off the critical blade angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) If you&#x27;ve been using an electric razor or not shaving at all, I recommend you wet shave with a regular cartridge razor for a week prior to using this razor for the first time.  Doing so will get your face ready for the slightly more aggressive blade, and the inevitable burn wrought by your unpracticed hand.  Razor burn is caused by using too much pressure.  The perfect amount takes time to learn... too little and you&#x27;ll have stubble, but don&#x27;t be afraid to experiment with adding a little more pressure if you&#x27;ve already been wet shaving with cartridge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Use a high-quality shaving cream!  Until recently, I had always used grocery store brands, then I was given a free sample of shaving cream in a single-use packet while walking past a high-end barbershop on the Vegas strip.  I thought &amp;#34;Yeah, whatever.&amp;#34;  Nonetheless, I tried it and had one of those &amp;#34;Oh my god!&amp;#34; moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) Don&#x27;t hesitate to lather up more than once, even on your first few passes.  The first few times I used this razor I was so careful &amp; slow that the shaving cream on my face began to dry up.  I&#x27;m faster now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.) Razor burn will be a little more noticeable for the first week, so get a good aftershave balm (lotion), and use a lot of it to moisturize &amp; sooth your face.  Also, avoid any aftershave with alcohol in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.) Change the blade at the end of each week.  The manufacturers say change after 5 shaves, I just do it at the end of the week (typically 7 shaves).ady for the slightly more aggressive blade, and the inevitable burn wrought by your unpracticed hand.

    <li> This old style safety razor is AMAZING!!! The craftsmanship on this this is unreal. I did not know that you could still buy things that are made this well. Coupled with Astra blades, this gives me the best shaves that I have ever had. I will never buy cartridge razors again! These are a little pricey to start out with, but I can shave for 1 year on a box of 100 blades that cost less than $12.00. That is a huge savings through out your lifetime. You will never regret buying one of these!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Giving this razor to my son as a gift.  Beautifully matches the Muehle DE Razor and DE Brush (RHMSRSET) stand and chrome Muehle badger hair brush.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this razor so much, this purchase is my second Muhle R89 Grande so that I could have a back up of this razor. This is such an under rated razor, I absolutely love this thing.</li>
    <li> Perfect for when you want a close shave but don&#x27;t want to spend very much time.  Very forgiving and effective razor</li>
    <li> High quality, nice weight. Very easy to switch blades out. Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This my front line razor. Heavy easy to hold. No complaints. The backup is a two piece Merkel. I prefer the heavier handle. Feather razors.</li>
    <li> Got this from a local Artofshaving store..i have used DE razors close to 15 Yrs..and i must say that this is one of the best DE razors out there..price is  a bit high..but for the quality i would not make much fuss abt it..please understand any razor from lowest to highest would take sometime to get used to..depending on the cream/gel/foam that will be used...i have a thick beard..and with first pass..close shave..and for the second pass...all clear...Of course..every person&#x27;s beard is different,and requires different technique :)..but this R89 Grande from Muhle should be on top of your list..longtime investment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the following was what i used:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1:Muhle R89 grande DE Razor&lt;br /&gt;2:Gillette 7&#x27;o clock blade&lt;br /&gt;3:Art of shaving preshave oil along with their sandalwood shaving cream..</li>
    <li> This razor is of the highest quality and gives a great shave. I just wish Muhle razors were not so expensive. For much less money, you can purchase a quality Edwin Jagger or Merkur razor.</li>
    <li> I received this razor as a gift from my aunt about a year ago when I started wanting to get into safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of that year I had an enjoyable experience. The weight and size of this razor was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CON:&lt;br /&gt; After I was done shaving today, I took it apart to clean it like I always do. As I was screwing the razor back together, the threaded part just broke off into the handle. The end of the screw still stuck in the handle did not look like steel and more like pot metal. Knowing that my aunt bought it from The Art of Shaving, I went on their website to see the description of it.  Apparently this razor is made from Zamak Metal with a chrome plating. Zamak can be considered a pot metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For how much this razor costs, I would have expected it to be made of something stronger, like steel, and last a lot longer than a year.</li>
    <li> Classic style razor, excellent craftsmanship, beautifully balanced, timeless design. Would recommend this razor to anyone. Also recommend feather blades to use in this bad boy – great shave every time.</li>
    <li> Superb build quality. Heavy razor gives nice control over your shaving. Comfortable to use. For my hands, size is not really an issue.</li>
    <li> Bought this item in December 2012 after deciding that I wanted to go more \\&quot;old school\\&quot; in terms of the shaving experience.  Previously, I was using a cartridge razor (Mach 3) stainless steel that my wife bought me from The Art of Shaving as a Christmas gift.  Nothing wrong with the cartridge razor...it has served me well over the last 7 years, as mentioned, I wanted something more Old School.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of my research involved reading reviews/comments online (via Amazon or Youtube) and talking to my barber.  I opted for a safety razor vs. the straight edge razor because I wanted to get that \\&quot;Old School\\&quot; experience but NOT spend too much time in the mornings shaving (i.e., using a straight edge seemed like it would take a little longer because you have to be more careful using it).  I may go for a straight edge blade down the road as something I do during the weekends or holidays when I have more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the Merkurs (Futur, Vision, 34C., etc.), the Edwin Jagger, Parker, etc. and all seemed nice razors.  Eventually, I opted on the Muhle R89 Grande because when I was at the store checking out razors, this one just felt GREAT in my hand.  Although it is a 3 piece system, I don&#x27;t find it time consuming or difficult to change out the razors.  The weight of the R89 allows the razor to do all of the work as it slides down the side of my face.  I&#x27;ve experienced zero ingrown hairs and/or razor burn while using this razor and I&#x27;ve used it at least 10 times since I bought it.  On my first try with a safety razor and had ZERO nicks or cuts!!!  You definitely need a steady hand when using a safety razor vs. using a cartridge system and to take your time using a safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this safety razor.  It is well built and has a nice weight to it.  It is even easy to clean and replace the razors.  I even bought the stand which allows me to hang the razor and my badger brush.</li>
