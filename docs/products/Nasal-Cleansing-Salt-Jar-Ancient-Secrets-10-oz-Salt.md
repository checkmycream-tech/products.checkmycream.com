      <li>I was at my wits end going to the doctor three or four times a year for a sinus infection, taking antibiotcs and steroids that much concerned me.</li>
      <li>I have tried it when the water and, by accident, when the water had cooled too much.  </li>

      <li>I tried several other brands and found this one to be superior.</li>

      <li>The overall effect, though, is not bad.  </li>
      <li>With allergy season around the corner, I needed to find a treatment that was &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Neti pot recently, and consulted with numerous &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34; friends about how to use it safely.</li>
      <li>Got tired of opening and paying for all those little packets - this has been convenient, effective, and economical, 3 of my favorite words.  </li>
      <li>Also for the first time in 10 years my left ear isn&#x27;t stuffed up, and I can hear out of it 100% again.</li>
      <li>though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m completely sold  </li>
      <li>My wife suggested this, it sounded goofy, but I tried it and it works... at least for me.</li>
      <li>And the little scoop is just right, fits well inside the container.</li>

<li> Since I have Sjogen&#x27;s Syndrome,having the salty fluid in my nasal passages isn&#x27;t all that different from very watery mucous, though I am careful about not getting too much down my throat.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this particular brand</li>
<li> Anyhow, the key message is that done carefully, nasal cleaning is nothing to fear.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve long suffered with nasal conjestion and sinus pain</li>
<li> It lasts a long time and does the job.</li>
<li> Within the past year, I developed an allergy to the chemicals in my allergy nasal spray, and can no longer use it.</li>
<li> I have bought various products and this product in the store in a little zip lock baggie.</li>
<li> Just what I expected.  </li>
<li> Unlike some other products, this salt comes in a jar with a lid.</li>
<li> EXTREMELY WELL!</li>
<li> I use it regularly, takes 2 minutes, and no more sinus infections!</li>

<li> Yes,  but i noticed that it doesnt have an expiration  date on it.i had a small travel bag it did have the date</li>
<li> Sometimes a little irritating to my nose and throat if I don&#x27;t stir it in all the way.</li>
<li> This is way less expensive and easier to get product out of.</li>
<li> that my &#x27;cold&#x27; didn&#x27;t just run its usual course, it wasn&#x27;t as difficult or messy as I feared it would be.</li>
<li> I was afraid it would be just like when you accidentally take in a noseful of water while swimming -- isn&#x27;t that sharp discomfort the worst?</li>
<li> the store kinda disappointing</li>
<li> I was about to catch cold couple of times during this winter.</li>
<li> Bought these for my husband who needs the netti pot during bad allergy seasons.</li>
<li> This has been a bad Spring for allergies with all the pollen we get at home and in our garden plot.</li>
<li> It keeps me from getting sick from viruses as well.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried several other brands and found this one to be superior.</li>
    <li> Got tired of opening and paying for all those little packets - this has been convenient, effective, and economical, 3 of my favorite words.  Do not recommend as a starter kit since it has no dispenser.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think there would be much different between this and diluted table salt.  It definitely makes a difference.  I use this with my neti pot and as a mouth cleanser.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Used it once and it works great.  Came really quickly.</li>
    <li> Great price great product!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband who needs the netti pot during bad allergy seasons. He says that they work much better then the other types of salt he has tried. I&#x27;m not sure what it is about this particular brand but it does seem to do the job better then the others. This is the only brand we purchase now.</li>
    <li> Yes,  but i noticed that it doesnt have an expiration  date on it.i had a small travel bag it did have the date</li>
    <li> I have bought various products and this product in the store in a little zip lock baggie. This is way less expensive and easier to get product out of. It lasts a long time and does the job. Would buy again...and again.</li>
    <li> This product is very good and it works well. A good value and at a fair price. You will be happy</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have a jar and use it daily to rinse our sinutis. This has been a bad Spring for allergies with all the pollen we get at home and in our garden plot.</li>
    <li> It was a interesting experience to use the cleansing salt to clear nasal congestion &amp; infection, the natural way. This is&lt;br /&gt;the Best way by far to go. Simple to use. I suggest this to anyone who has sinus issues. Sincerely Truthful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s salt in a jar with a measuring spoon. It works. There isn&#x27;t much more you can say about it.</li>
    <li> Well I tried the Netti pot option and though I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m completely sold  that my &#x27;cold&#x27; didn&#x27;t just run its usual course, it wasn&#x27;t as difficult or messy as I feared it would be. I was afraid it would be just like when you accidentally take in a noseful of water while swimming -- isn&#x27;t that sharp discomfort the worst? It&#x27;s not like that at all though if you follow the instructions. I will definitely be trying this again the next time my nasal passages feel blocked.</li>
    <li> Sometimes a little irritating to my nose and throat if I don&#x27;t stir it in all the way. Not the salt&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> Within the past year, I developed an allergy to the chemicals in my allergy nasal spray, and can no longer use it. With allergy season around the corner, I needed to find a treatment that was &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Neti pot recently, and consulted with numerous &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34; friends about how to use it safely. Got some pure non-iodized salt, some distilled water, and some instructions on sanitizing my pot. Just used it for the first time, and WOW!!!! I can breathe again!!! Also for the first time in 10 years my left ear isn&#x27;t stuffed up, and I can hear out of it 100% again. I didn&#x27;t even have results like that with my prescription nasal spray!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is wonderful! I am hopeful, as I&#x27;m told that it works wonders on allergies and might even help in reversing my MCS symptoms. Woo hoo!!!</li>
    <li> Just exactly what we needed!</li>
    <li> The first time when I used it, gave me abit of stingy feel, but didn&#x27;t feel it afterwards, maybe I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s abit troublesome at times to scoop up salts and they may crystalized too, but overall, it&#x27;s money well-spent.</li>
    <li> The best Salt for my Neti!</li>
    <li> I have used this salt for many years and always get the same satisfaction.  I use it for nasal congestion-allergy related.  It keeps me from getting sick from viruses as well.  It is a part of my wellness routine and  I recommend it to anybody focused on healthy living.</li>
    <li> GOT FOR A GIFT&#x3D;&#x3D;THEY LIKED IT</li>
    <li> I was about to catch cold couple of times during this winter. Both time, this product saved me. Very little quantity is enough for each cleansing and it is really a good have product!</li>
    <li> Good quality salt. And the little scoop is just right, fits well inside the container. Unlike some other products, this salt comes in a jar with a lid.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Use as directed of course, if you use too much, it will burn. I always use the Neti pot in the winter months and it really helps to ward off the sinus infections.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Product exactly what I wanted. Good price. Excellent service from seller. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was at my wits end going to the doctor three or four times a year for a sinus infection, taking antibiotcs and steroids that much concerned me. My wife suggested this, it sounded goofy, but I tried it and it works... at least for me. I use it regularly, takes 2 minutes, and no more sinus infections!</li>
    <li> MILD,  BUT REALLY WORKS EXTREMELY WELL!</li>
    <li> I get allergies and this really helps keep things clean. I got this quickly delivered to me and you just can&#x27;t beat the value.</li>
    <li> Great product and wonderful service from the seller.</li>
    <li> Excellent salt which I use with my Netti Pot.  It works quite well.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.  Works fine. Thanks.</li>
    <li> was thinking i was ordering some special stuff and after reading the label after i received it i realized it is just plain non iodized salt that you can buy for a dollar @ the store kinda disappointing</li>
    <li> Got this salt at the same time I got a neti pot from the same company. I&#x27;ve used a neti pot for years, and this salt is the best. It dissolves very easily, which is important to us net potters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long suffered with nasal conjestion and sinus pain and I was very reluctant to try the neti pot and the cleansing salt as an alternative to pills, but I did and now I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the way the solution cleans out my sinuses.  I have tried it when the water and, by accident, when the water had cooled too much.  Warm is better.  The overall effect, though, is not bad.  The solution does not sting.  Since I have Sjogen&#x27;s Syndrome,having the salty fluid in my nasal passages isn&#x27;t all that different from very watery mucous, though I am careful about not getting too much down my throat.  Anyhow, the key message is that done carefully, nasal cleaning is nothing to fear.  The results are great.  I use the solution before bed, then am able to sleep most of the night, even now with the beginning of pollen season.</li>
