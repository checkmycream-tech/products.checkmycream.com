      <li>Worth the few dollars it was</li>
      <li>I was recently in the market for a new signature cologne to wear on a daily basis and I remembered this cologne from back in the day</li>

    <li> I forgot how good this stuff smells!! Thanks!! Received on time.</li>
    <li> I love Candies cologne for men</li>
    <li> i was greatly disappointed with the size.. i mean its exactly what i was looking for but the size its too small..</li>
    <li> I bought it for a Christmas present for my son whose wife likes it.  I sure don&#x27;t think it is worth the price, and I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> to small of a bottle for the price larger bottles are way to expensive as this was to expensive for the amount supplied not worth the money to buy</li>
    <li> Worth the few dollars it was</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent and I can&#x27;t get enough of him when he wears it.  Shipment was fast with no errors, either.</li>
    <li> ...or at least close enough. Liz Clairborne&#x27;s Candies has been off the market for quite some time now. I am not sure this is exactly the same but it is close enough. Before I bought, I looked at a dropper for children&#x27;s medicine to get a good idea of how much I was getting. It&#x27;s pretty small. I only wanted it for nostalgia and maybe some outings and it is fairly cheap. Overall, I am pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> My son has been looking for the cologne for some time. He use to wear it often when he could find it and was very happy to see that I was able to get it. Very small bottle though.</li>
    <li> This was exactally what i expected</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne. It&#x27;s his favorite, I am so happy i found it for him.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!!! Smells great!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells nice, but you have to be in a certain situation to put it on (maybe church, graduation, or a wedding); it&#x27;s not an everyday cologne because of that but also because it is a discontinued brand so it has to be used sparingly. When I was younger I had a large bottle and I was crazy for the stuff...it did not smell so aggressive back in the day (or as I remembered).  I was recently in the market for a new signature cologne to wear on a daily basis and I remembered this cologne from back in the day so I bought this on amazon. Once I took a wiff my brain actually told me that I&#x27;ve outgrown this smell and I should look elsewhere. This is not an aquatic-type smell so it is not for me anymore. If you are looking for a cologne with non-aggressive smooth aquatic scent to it try Antonio Banderas Blue Seduction for Men or Gap Deep Homme/Men...both will fish you compliments...mainly from the ladies.

    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff. I have been wearing Candies since high school. It&#x27;s expensive and you don&#x27;t get much but you cannot find this stuff anywhere anymore. I considered myself lucky to find it on Amazon. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Great men&#x27;s cologne ,smells  great just wish it was back at the local store. I remember when it only  cost twenty  dollars for a 1.8 fl Oz spray bottle.  Crazy times</li>
    <li> Use to be my go to de-stinktifier, but they quit making it years ago (WHY?) I love the smell of this and so does my wife.</li>
    <li> Product was a little small for the price.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this item. My husband had worn this for several years but we could no longer find it. Great to have it again</li>
    <li> this is nice. its sweet. kinda heavy. less is more. no complaints at all. ordering another bottle as soon as i finish this review. this is a good size cause u don&#x27;t need to put on a lot. its a better fragrance than smell, if that makes sense</li>
    <li> I know the description has the size in it but I just assumed it was a normal size like what you could buy at the drug store. I was sadly dissapointed when I got them... Good thing I bought 2 I suppose.</li>
