### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but this one is perfect for using while standing up,no need to lean against a wall anymore.</li>
      <li>my massager arrived in was impressed with the quality,  sleek packaging and design, and 1 yr warranty</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been an excellent product in a couple situation and just as good by it self.  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied!</li>
      <li>Great buy</li>
      <li>Great product, great shipping.</li>
      <li>But it is also a great toy to use together.</li>
      <li>Great battery life as well.</li>
      <li>This is a great to for her to use alone.</li>
      <li>Quality is great as always from this company.</li>
      <li>This is manufacured nicely and does a great job.</li>
      <li>Good purchase.</li>
      <li>The money I saved in batteries alone made it worth the price, but it was also perfect size, intensity, and has lasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the fact you do not need batteries!</li>
      <li>I will definately try more products from lilly!++++</li>
      <li>This is by far the best discrete cordless massager around.</li>
      <li>this day it still stays charged just as much as originally and the most damage that it has is that after about 6 months, the pretty flowers rubbed off but that makes perfect sense for the amount of use it</li>
      <li>Love the sleek design but does not pack the punch that I need</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just so glad I found Lelo,  </li>
      <li>Still love it.</li>
      <li>… the color is lovely, and it&#x27;s virtually silent (a very good thing) …</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also pretty awesome for couples because it&#x27;s so small and can fit between you and another person easily and make sex amazing for both parties!</li>
      <li>The shape of nea is a perfect fit for the pelvic bone,  and with 8 different vibe settings from gentle to strong and 5 pulsating settings</li>
      <li>As a vibrator, it&#x27;s attractive, very convenient to hold and use, and very effective… when it works.  </li>
      <li>I got a good deal on ebay.com for this product versus buying at the actual website.</li>
      <li>Everything about this package of pleasure is far superior to most adult toys.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small,sleek and very pretty(mine is black) and just perfect for travel!</li>
      <li>Maybe I will try the Siri next, because it supposedly has some more oomph!  </li>
      <li>It is well worth my money, because it comes with a 10 year warranty.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always ready, fully charged, charges quickly and lasts a good long time!  </li>
      <li>I was looking for something powerful enough for someone who needs a lot of stimulation, but not so powerful that I get more desensitized</li>
      <li>Now the replacement is holding its charge better than the first, but not nearly as long as advertised.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for helping keep a smile on my wife.</li>
      <li>diescret  small yet strong where it needs to be , Very high quality and very comfortable  Worth every penny  </li>
      <li>I am convinced Lelo has a far superior product than any other sex toy company out there!  </li>
      <li>The vibrating action can be controlled from soft to strong with five or six diffrent vibrating variations.</li>
      <li>You plug it in and within two hours ita fully charged and ready to sooth pains or itches a lady might have.</li>
      <li>She absolutely loves this vibe.  </li>
      <li>I have had to recharge this thing more than all the other toys combined.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this little toy will suit the needs of some more sensitive ladies, but it&#x27;s simply not for me (and until now I thought I was sensitive!)</li>
      <li>this is her favorite hands down here</li>
      <li>highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the seller.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended this product.</li>
      <li>, most of them dying in a few months.</li>
      <li>I heard about Lelo personal massagers awhile ago, but they didn&#x27;t seem to be worth the hefty retail price until I found that amazon sold them for cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>Its cute, little,&amp; does the job!</li>
      <li>In fact she used it daily and even wore it around the house inside her panties for the first week after receiving.  </li>
      <li>I noticed it when I first purchased it, after I used it only two times (10 minutes each!)  </li>
      <li>BUT I had to send the first one back because the battery would not hold a charge.  </li>
      <li>garuntee Lelo offers,  not to mention lifetime replacement plan that offers you 50% any new lelo product that replaces it when it is out of commission.&lt;br /&gt;After using the Lelo Nea,  </li>
      <li>Anywhoo, as I am on anti-depressants lately I&#x27;ve been having sexual dysfunctions</li>
      <li>I was really surprised.</li>
      <li>boyfriend also loves the Nea because it keeps me satisfied during intercourse and is small enough that it does not hinder positioning or his pleasure.  </li>
      <li>Does take a few hours to recharge to full strength.</li>
      <li>I had hoped it would have been at least half again as large with more movement.</li>
      <li>The Nea is such a cute and sleek little thing, I was surprised at how small it really is.  </li>
      <li>This little toy is worth</li>
      <li>its small size and big vibe are exactly what she wants to use on herself as I am working her over.</li>
      <li>I went to use it on the third day and it was dead after a full battery charge.  </li>
      <li>However, the battery life on the one I received lasted nowhere near as long as the manufacturer says it is supposed to.  </li>

<li> The Nea is so simple: use, wash, dry, recharge and repeat!  </li>
<li> is why its small enough to be discreet,powerful enough to be called a mini hitachi and rechargeable</li>
<li> and I actually NEED less vibrations, it works wonders for me at the moment.</li>
<li> I am sending this one back unfortunately, because I had high hopes based on the other reviews.  </li>
<li> My husband and I, (each our 2nd marriage) discovered these little do-jobbies about 10 years ago and cannot do without having one always with us!  </li>
<li> So I guess based on the other reviews I must have gotten a dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Well if you just need affirmation to drop what seems like a sizable amount for such a small toy here</li>
<li> This past time I charged it fully, used it once (for 5 minutes) and the next day it was dead.  </li>
<li> When I first bought this product almost a year ago I was a bit disappointed because the vibrations were not that heavy.</li>
<li> as well you can&#x27;t go wrong with picking a setting that fits the current sensitivity level.&lt;br</li>
<li> weight in gold!I have another small vibrator</li>
<li> I also was not very impressed with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
<li> Every time after that the battery got worse.  </li>
<li> If you need heavy vibrations do not get this product, you will be disappointed.</li>
<li> It was too small!!!  </li>
<li> I was wrong.</li>
<li> I bought this product because I was sick of buying vibrators at sex shops that died in 6 months or a year</li>
<li> When I opened the box I was a bit disappointed.</li>

    <li> diescret  small yet strong where it needs to be , Very high quality and very comfortable  Worth every penny  Great buy</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  It&#x27;s been an excellent product in a couple situation and just as good by it self.  I highly recommended this product.</li>
    <li> This little toy is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!I have another small vibrator but this one is perfect for using while standing up,no need to lean against a wall anymore.It&#x27;s small,sleek and very pretty(mine is black) and just perfect for travel! It&#x27;s rechargable too! I wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
    <li> Bought this two years ago. Still love it. Still works. Lelo is quality.</li>
    <li> No complaints! Very satisfied! Its cute, little,&amp; does the job! Great battery life as well. I will definately try more products from lilly!++++</li>
    <li> … the color is lovely, and it&#x27;s virtually silent (a very good thing) … BUT I had to send the first one back because the battery would not hold a charge.  Now the replacement is holding its charge better than the first, but not nearly as long as advertised.  As a vibrator, it&#x27;s attractive, very convenient to hold and use, and very effective… when it works.  The persistence of charge issue remains problematic.</li>

    <li> Well if you just need affirmation to drop what seems like a sizable amount for such a small toy here it is.My wife has every size shape and brand of toy out there this is her favorite hands down here is why its small enough to be discreet,powerful enough to be called a mini hitachi and rechargeable so she can use it again and again and well you get the point.Quality is great as always from this company.JUST BUY IT ALREADY!</li>
    <li> Not quite enough power</li>
    <li> My husband and I, (each our 2nd marriage) discovered these little do-jobbies about 10 years ago and cannot do without having one always with us!  Ususally there are several, but always \\&quot;bullet\\&quot; type and corded.  The Nea is so simple: use, wash, dry, recharge and repeat!  It&#x27;s always ready, fully charged, charges quickly and lasts a good long time!  And as a bonus, it comes with a 1 year warranty and 10 year guarantee!  Just register your purchase!</li>
    <li> I got this almost a year ago now. I was looking for something powerful enough for someone who needs a lot of stimulation, but not so powerful that I get more desensitized and it has been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about buying a toy that&#x27;s on the expensive side, but it was worth every penny and more!

    <li> When I first bought this product almost a year ago I was a bit disappointed because the vibrations were not that heavy. I bought this product because I was sick of buying vibrators at sex shops that died in 6 months or a year, most of them dying in a few months. Fed up with these &#x27;novelty vibrators&#x27; I got a good deal on ebay.com for this product versus buying at the actual website. It is well worth my money, because it comes with a 10 year warranty. Love the fact you do not need batteries! I can tell you that! Anywhoo, as I am on anti-depressants lately I&#x27;ve been having sexual dysfunctions and I actually NEED less vibrations, it works wonders for me at the moment. Also I don&#x27;t mind that it isn&#x27;t waterproof, and I havent had any issue with cleaning it. If you need heavy vibrations do not get this product, you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best discrete cordless massager around. You plug it in and within two hours ita fully charged and ready to sooth pains or itches a lady might have. The vibrating action can be controlled from soft to strong with five or six diffrent vibrating variations. Everything about this package of pleasure is far superior to most adult toys. This is manufacured nicely and does a great job. Thanks for helping keep a smile on my wife.</li>
    <li> Good purchase. I highly recommend the seller.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised. When I opened the box I was a bit disappointed. I was expecting something bigger. This is really tiny. I was wrong. My girlfriend had no experience with toys and this was one of a bunch that I bought so she could experiment. she loves it. its small size and big vibe are exactly what she wants to use on herself as I am working her over. I have had to recharge this thing more than all the other toys combined. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I am sending this one back unfortunately, because I had high hopes based on the other reviews.  The Nea is such a cute and sleek little thing, I was surprised at how small it really is.  However, the battery life on the one I received lasted nowhere near as long as the manufacturer says it is supposed to.

Every time after that the battery got worse.  This past time I charged it fully, used it once (for 5 minutes) and the next day it was dead.  So I guess based on the other reviews I must have gotten a dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be ordering another one, and not only because of the battery situation, which could be enough for me.  I also was not very impressed with it&#x27;s performance.  It just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to suit my needs.  Maybe I will try the Siri next, because it supposedly has some more oomph!  And if it doesn&#x27;t do the trick, then what&#x27;s the point?  I&#x27;m sure this little toy will suit the needs of some more sensitive ladies, but it&#x27;s simply not for me (and until now I thought I was sensitive!)</li>
    <li> It was too small!!!  I had hoped it would have been at least half again as large with more movement.</li>
    <li> She absolutely loves this vibe.  In fact she used it daily and even wore it around the house inside her panties for the first week after receiving.  Does take a few hours to recharge to full strength.</li>
    <li> Love the sleek design but does not pack the punch that I need</li>
    <li> This is a great to for her to use alone. But it is also a great toy to use together.</li>
    <li> Great product, great shipping.</li>
