<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I loved these soaps.  They are small, hotel sample size bars.  The various scents are pleasant.  They are not typical feminine scents.  Though they are not especially masculine either.  The scents included are Cassia Clove, Lavender, Ginger Berry, Peppermint, Patchouli, and Lemongrass.  I like using small soaps in bathrooms guests might use.  I also like having various scents on hand.  The plumber doesn&#x27;t want to wash his hands in rose scented soap no matter how much I like it.  These soaps are not used up as quickly as some people have said in their reviews.  Unless you spend a couple hours in the shower soaping yourself all over again and again.  As hand soaps they last a good couple of months.</li>
    <li> I gave these soaps as a bday gift. She loved the smell so much she put one in a mesh little bag...one for her purse and one near her bed. She just loved them!</li>
    <li> This was a great way to test out these soaps.  I loved both the smell and the way the soaps lathered up.  If you want to try before buying these samples are a great way to go!</li>
    <li> Love!!  The price was great and the product was supreme.  The soap bars are small, but was a perfect and inexpensive gift to divide and put in gift baskets for anyone!  I hope I can part with them.</li>
    <li> This is a great sample of 6 great soaps.  A must give or get!!</li>
    <li> nice and relaxing scent</li>
    <li> I really like the aroma these soaps give off.  The one I am using creates ample suds and leaves your hands feeling smooth and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> Great gift!  If you don&#x27;t know what to give, you can&#x27;t lose with this one.  It has alittle bit for everyone.  Downside is you will get that person hooked on Plantlife soap..  I guess a good problem!</li>
    <li> Great little sampler of some awesome organic soaps infused with great essential oils!  They all smell wonderful and will get you hooked on Plantlife products!</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap as a Christmas gift for a friend.  They smelled wonderful while they were here, they even smelled great in the car while delivering them.  She was thrilled  to have received them.  I will be ordering myself some soon!</li>
    <li> Delightful soaps. I love that it leaves your skin lightly scented - these are my new day-wear scents. Especially love Patchouli and GingerBerry.</li>
    <li> This was such a small package of soap it is basically only useful for the bathroom sink.  Definitely not worth the price.  They all smell the same.  I pretty much just paid over ten bucks for one bar of soap.</li>
    <li> Nice soaps.  Too small. And fragrances blended together.</li>
    <li> my skin felt like silk after i used this soap.  gave one to my husband and he loves it also.  no more shower gel for me</li>
    <li> The Herbal Soap Sampler arrived in a timely manner and I am pleased with my purchase.  The soap is high quality and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> These soaps smell wonderful!  It was so fun to open the box to such a wonderful scent.  Love that they are made with essential oils.</li>
    <li> I think that these soaps are well made and do a great job cleaning. I am not a fan of the scents that they chose to use and maybe that is the main reason I was so dissapointed. I only liked the scent lemongrass and only got mayber 6 showers out of it. The other scents were to earty and strong. The main issue for me was that the way they are packaged there is only a tiny peice of cardboard seperating each soap. The soap smells almost blend into one another to a certain extent. That being said I LOVED the lemongrass soap. I am actually planning on buying the 6 pack and using that instead of my body wash on most days. My skin feels smooth, soft and clean as a whistle. I am very irrated by a lot of soaps and this one is just beautiful. It is changing the quality of my skin. I gave the rest of the soaps to my Mom as she enjoyed the scents and didn&#x27;t mind the scent bleeding. She just loves them and probably would have given the package a 5 star. I will be giving the single soap (larger size) a higher review for those very same reason</li>
    <li> Well, I assumed these would be roughly normal-sized bars of soaps, but they were pretty small.  The box you see is about 3&#x27;&#x27;x 4&#x27;&#x27;  so don&#x27;t expect to wash your way into the future. But they smell nice</li>
    <li> Delightful scents! I&#x27;ve boufht this as a gift for later in the year--hope the recipient loves these as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for two of my friends as well as myself. I absolutely love it!! They were a bit smaller than I anticipated but each bar lasts about 2 weeks or so. They smell amazing and work great!! I feel nice and clean after using it! FYI, the soap does dry your skin so you want to make sure to use a moisturizer of some sort afterwards. I&#x27;m planning on buying more once I run out!</li>
    <li> This soap I came across when searching for the Primal Elements soap. I am very glad I did. Its a great sampler and I will be ordering some of the individual scents in the larger form for gifts and personal use. The delivery was fast and efficient. I am very pleased</li>
    <li> Just pure, natural ingredients.  They lather up nicely, smell just like they are supposed to (but not too strong) and my guests love using it when they visit.</li>
    <li> I have bought these before . I really enjoy the different ones. Makes your bathroom smell good too.lol Never hurts to have a advantage on smelling good.</li>
    <li> Got just what I ordered from this company and on time. I would also gladly be happy to do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the broad range of fragrances that came with this product.  It was my first experience with an organic body soap and I was pleasantly pleased with the results.  The packaging was interesting and separated the soaps to prevent any of the smells from mingling, which was a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;Each bar lasted about 2 weeks for me with daily use in the shower.  I noticed improved softness and less itching from dry skin within a few days.  I did not have issues with sensitivity. The smells weren&#x27;t overpowering and I loved the way the peppermint made my skin tingle.&lt;br /&gt;As a woman, my only issue was the Patchouli.  It&#x27;s more of a man&#x27;s scent than a woman&#x27;s.  I ended up passing it along to my husband.  The others were great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since tried a few other brands with different bases and haven&#x27;t been nearly as happy with the results.  I&#x27;ll plan on buying my favorites of these.</li>
    <li> smells too soapy for me.</li>
    <li> Yes they are sample size soaps, the part that says soap sampler should make it obvious. I liked the soaps and have since reordered regular sized bars.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom.  She loves it.  The scents are wonderful.  The only thing I wish, is that each soap was a little bigger.  They are so quick to go through!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Love this soap glad I purchased the sample pack now I can pick my favorite one and I will surely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> These soaps smelled wonderful - each one.  They lasted a good while too despite their tiny size.  They made my skin soft and helped with my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I initially received this set of soaps as a gift.  I love the fragrance of each bar.  The fragrance fills my guest bathroom and the soap is very nice.  I liked them enough that I have repurchased for myself.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful,your skin feels refresh after use any single one ,love it, i buy more as a gift to muy son&#x27;s teachers  and they say they love it .The only thing is that they are really small</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. Awesome aromas. Used them right away. Satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Sorry but not worth the price at all - will not buy again - Xmas present not good try to improve</li>
    <li> The little bitty small soups. Expected normal size bars</li>
    <li> These soaps are great!  I smell better and my skin is not left feeling dry.  Win...Win!&lt;br /&gt;Clove is my fave</li>
    <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure what all these scents smell like, I&#x27;d recommend buy this sample pack.  You can figure out which scent you like best and then next time purchase the larger bar.  If you use these bars for showering, you will probably get about 10 washes out of them (they are not standard size soaps, more like the samll soaps you get at hotels).  I like the patcholi best.  Plantlife seems to put out the strongest smelling essential oils soaps.</li>
    <li> All the soaps smell great and I love that this product is vegan and therefore not tested on animals. They are small but this is a sampler so that is to be expected. Would buy again as well as give as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love these soaps.  They smell yummy and last a long time.  A true treat.</li>
    <li> Great small hotel size bars.</li>
    <li> THESE SOAP SMELLS GREAT AND A FACT IS THAT THEY ARRIVED ON A SEALED BOX AND I CAN STILL SMELL IT LIKE IF I HAVE IT ON MY HAND, IMPRESSIVE.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected,</li>
    <li> My friend loved these and thought it was a great pick me up to her day when they arrived on time and in good condition. I personally didn&#x27;t see or smell them but she said they smelled wonderful and was surprised that these little soaps were available so easily. Thank you, Amazon, for again helping me to share some fun for a person who doesn&#x27;t get out much. She&#x27;s tickled to have them. Made me feel good to have her so happy. Shine on, Amazon.</li>
    <li> i read a review that said last 5 days i think. mine seem to last a few days more so they do disappear fast but very relax scents leaves skin soft</li>
    <li> I Love the Natural smells and the clean feeling the natural soaps leave behind.  Just wish they were a full size to last much longer.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom as a gift. She loved it and we really liked that you could actually identify what the soap claimed to smell like.</li>
    <li> I received it quite quickly, which surprised me. I was expecting the samples to be a bit bigger and individually wrapped so that the different essences would not mingle. They feel nice and soft. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but when I do, I do believe they will be a very nice experience.</li>
    <li> These are very relaxing, I love them! They don&#x27;t dry my skin too.</li>
    <li> The fragrances are wonderful, and they make a luxurious, creamy lather that makes them a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> Really nice soap sampler.  Very nice feel on the skin, and fragrance is awesome - love it.  Would like to  purchase larger soaps of several of the ones I&#x27;ve tried that I like the scents best.  Hopefully can do that soon.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t have much of a sent</li>
    <li> The package was a day late but thats okay, it was worth the wait! the soaps have a strong scent to them but i like that ! they are vegan soaps so you are getting high quality  products. they can even be used on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the picture of the product does look like they would be big, BUT they are samples for a reason. in my opinion its worth the money. i do see myself buying this again.</li>
    <li> The soap was much Smaller then what it thought  was going to be, and the soap smelt very strong. Nothing i will ever buy again. but it shipped on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> I never used them to bathe with the lovely smell is better than any air freshener and lasts so much longer.</li>
    <li> Love the smells of these soaps.</li>
    <li> These are great soaps.. They&#x27;re small and don&#x27;t last very long, but still worth a 5 star rating</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas and she loves it! This company will be my go-to present place from now on!</li>
    <li> My GF loved these soaps!  They smelled great on her and they lasted a long time (they did not melt away fast like some other natural soaps we got).  We purchase these soaps almost exclusively now.  I can say I was very impressed with them too.  We recommend them to any one who wants a great natural soap.</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed in fragrance and size of these soaps.  The fragrances are rather unpleasant.  Would not order again and will probably discard as it is not worth the effort to send it back</li>
    <li> A nice sampler however each smelled as the other so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if your trying to find a specific aroma your looking for</li>
    <li> These were so nice to smell as soon as I opened the package. I assumed they were larger than they were, but the word &amp;#34;sampler&amp;#34; is the operative word. Lol. That was MY mistake, and these are a lovely sampling of great smelling soaps. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This sampler was given as a gift to a family member. She stated it was of excellent quality with good fragrance.  Was also good for her sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she just raves about it. She loved the peppermint soap. They do smell similar when you first open it but with the real bits of herbs in each bar they smell great on their own.</li>
    <li> the soaps smell great!</li>
    <li> Did I miss something? I thought the bars would be slightly larger at least. The soap does come in great smelling samples but I would not have paid this much for the amount of soap available here.</li>
    <li> These soaps smell AMAZING, but I really should have checked the size before I ordered. They are very small for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product. Made into favors for a shower.</li>
    <li> very fragrant. I bought these for my apothecary jar decoration but these are too thin and don&#x27;t look great for decor. But I have no doubt that they are good soaps for bath.</li>
    <li> Great soaps.  I&#x27;m down to my last 2 bars; they last a long time and very gentle for the skin.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> super selection, fun to choose for each use</li>
    <li> Soaps were way smaller than expected, but I should have payed more attention to the word &amp;#34;sampler.&amp;#34;  All the scents are lovely though</li>
    <li> This soap makes you fell clean and fresh.  It makes you smell wonderful with the freshness of essential oils.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The soaps were a bit smaller than I had expected them to be, but it DID state that it was a SAMPLER. As such, the soaps are adequately sized for people to get an idea of which ones would be favorites.  They have a beautiful fragrance, and I&#x27;ll have fun trying them all out.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have tried many different soaps and this is the best. It makes you feel clean and smells great. I ran out of the soap and had to use another brand and I could tell the difference. The other soap irritated my skin and it didn&#x27;t make me feel as clean. I have recommended this product to many friends and family members and they love this soap.All the scents smell great. This soap is also great for sensitive and dry skin. You will not be disappointed..</li>
    <li> Purchased for a person who can only use all natural--she loved them.</li>
    <li> too small  ,the smell is so strange  ,and  nothing else ....the speed is ok  ,i just do not like the smell</li>
    <li> I liked how these smelled. I knew these were smaller than normal sized bars, but I didn&#x27;t expect them to be as small as they were. The price was too high for the size. I wouldn&#x27;t order them again.</li>
    <li> I like the variety of soaps in this sampler. They are very aromatic. I simply wish that they were larger. You will get one good use from each bar if you like to have lots of lather. It does provide, in my opinion, aromatherapy!  Very enjoyable.</li>
    <li> What I liked about these soaps is that they were organic and came in different fragrances. However they smell REALLY STRONG! I had to put them in two zip lock bags and that still didn&#x27;t keep the smell out. I ordered three and they could almost pass you out. The other downside is that there REALLY SMALL. I know that it&#x27;s a sampler but they were very tiny,but maybe that&#x27;s a good think for they are very potent and If you have a sensitive nose I would stand back.</li>
    <li> Love aromatherapy soap samples. Thanks</li>
    <li> I use these soaps at my business and they are a great hit. some people just keep them in their bathroom and it keeps the bathroom smelling fresh</li>
    <li> These soaps are just amazing. They smell super good and they send you a free little bar of a different soap to try. I showered with them and honestly, it felt amazing. The smell.. I can&#x27;t even describe it, it&#x27;s so good. Even in the packet that it comes in smell delicious. Truly the best soap ever! I couldn&#x27;t help but order another little pack for later on. I love that they send you a random free soap. (The double mint smells super good) Will buy again soon!</li>
    <li> Good soap,but does not smells strong. The strongest smell is a clove. I love it and buy it. Others smell almost the same.  So I prefer Zum Bar brend (cost about 1 bucks more for a regular size soap.) Also available at HEB in TX. Zum Bar smells much stronger and better, so I recomend to try it.</li>
    <li> My friend was thrilled when I gave her this soap as a surprise gift…i hope someone sends me a gift like this someday…she said they smelled fantastic!</li>
    <li> Smelled awful threw it away.</li>
    <li> These little bars of soap disintegrate so quickly. You use them a few times, and they break up into mushy globs very quickly, and it all ends up falling down into the drain about two days later. It&#x27;s not worth the bother, let alone the price.</li>
    <li> These soaps smell so good.  I keep them handy as therapy.  I give them to friends and they love them.  These are wonderful soaps.</li>
    <li> I do like the soap..... for the one showering that they will be used in :/.  They sure do look a lot bigger in the pic :)</li>
    <li> Of course, it&#x27;s just a sample, so the product is small.  I was hoping to get about a dozen showers out of each, but probably got around nine.  That said, they are wonderful bars, especially the lemon grass.  I liked the way my body smelled afterwards, not an overpowering odor, but subtle and pleasant.  Then, the texture of my skin was a bit softer too.  Only if the bar didn&#x27;t wear out as fast!</li>
    <li> These were a rip-off. Looks like you are getting several bars of soap...but, the &amp;#34;whole&amp;#34; box will fit in the palm of your hand.  You might get one or two hand washing from each bar....should have been given away as free samples.</li>
    <li> Very  nice fragrances.</li>
    <li> Soap samples were what I expected.  A nice sampling of the different scents.  I have them in my bath cupboard and it smells great when I open the door.</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging and absolutely divine scents!  Nice and mild for sensitive skin, works great, I&#x27;m very impressed.  I will be purchasing more clove soap.</li>
    <li> Great price, great smells, great soaps!  This sampler is a good intro to the brand and to get an idea which soaps and scents that you like.  My favorite was the clove but all of them were sooo good. They don&#x27;t last very long for me, maybe just a week?  Would make a really nice gift or just as a treat if you&#x27;re looking for non toxic soaps!</li>
    <li> Even the bathroom smells great!!</li>
    <li> New to the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; world, I was really impressed with the soap, LOVED the clove and the peppermint was awesome, though I did discover it&#x27;s not a great chilly weather soap!  I do wish this sampler contained the Vanilla Orange and a few more scents, but it was worth the money and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it for someone else.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my grandmother and she said it was great! I tried out the free sample they send with it and I also thought it was stunning. But since they are samples the soaps are a little on the small side</li>
    <li> Loved this!  Price perfect, and quality even better. The fragrances were amazing, perfect for the gift basket I was making. Shipping was great...received them in a day an a half. The recipient loved theses soaps.  Extremely happy....would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love Samplers...the soap has a good strong smell, which is lasting..this is a good gift for men or women.  Smells are very relaxing, just smells up the whole bathroom.  Also, purchased the Spa-Therpay Package..wonderful gifts.</li>
    <li> Awesome sampler I will buy again</li>
    <li> These were nice small soaps purchased for the dresser drawers. I always keep soaps in my drawers.  However, I did not care for the scents of these soaps.  My husband on the other hand loved the scents.</li>
    <li> Bars are way too small and don&#x27;t last long and are too small to easily hold or control in your hand.  They do smell great.</li>
    <li> I love these soaps as they are 100% natural made from pure essential oils. Even though they are small, but each one lasts almost 3 weeks with frequent usage.</li>
    <li> A nice and natural-looking assortment of herbal soaps in soothing colors. I purchased these for my daughter-in-law who is into massage therapy and organic products.  The bars are a bit small - the reason for only 4 stars.  I have not used them myself, as they are a gift.  The package smells quite nice, however, and they will make a nice gift instead of the very \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; smells and artificial colors of soaps from the body-shops.</li>
    <li> Love the different scents; the size of each bar is little small. I do realize it&#x27;s sampler but was hoping it might be a little larger!</li>
    <li> This is a great starter pack if you are unsure of the smells and such! They are not giant bars, but they are a good size for a sample. They are bigger than most hotel soaps. And they are aromatherapy for a reason.. they smell amazing!!</li>
    <li> I like the candle too and the sampler is a good idea too. I just have to try them all.</li>
    <li> The essential oils are so potent that it fills my whole room up with its scent. Just like with any soap, these soaps leave my skin squeaky clean so moisturize after.</li>
    <li> This is item is good. I bought it to go in holiday gift bags, so for that it is perfect. The bars are a bit  small though.</li>
    <li> Very, very strong (but good!) smelling. Just using it to keep the bathroom smelling good. All of the bars have their distinct smells.</li>
    <li> They all smell pretty good. I wish they had been individually wrapped so the smells didn&#x27;t run together. They were to drying to my skin to use in shower or bath so I used as hand soap instead. I would not buy again for the price and size.</li>
    <li> Nice soaps, but very small size.  Also, very strong smell.  when they are all together, it&#x27;s a little overpowering.  They work best individually.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase it&#x27;s nice to try the different samples they offer</li>
    <li> Love the smell of the soaps. Transaction was perfect. Shipping was fast. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Looks and smells great!</li>
    <li> These smell so wonderful!!! Love them.</li>
    <li> Not as aromatic in my bathroom as I&#x27;d hoped, I love filling the space with scents and you should be able to smell the soap after your shower. Nice lather and I loved the clean feeling though.</li>
    <li> bars too small for the price and not very scented. I understand it is a sampler but I was just not impressed with this product</li>
    <li> She loves them and told me to add to my future gift list if I so chose. Good Choice for your better half.</li>
    <li> NIce variety pack and fresh</li>
    <li> The smell, feels good</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells are great. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Love!  These smell fabulous and I received an extra patchoulli soap with my order.  This sampler is great for little gifts to friends and family or group members.  Great stocking stuffer. Nice for house guests when they spend the night, or a nice additive to a gift basket. I must get some more!</li>
    <li> Smell great and good quality. Gave as a gift. They loved them.</li>
    <li> good stuff, shipped fast, great quality will reorder when i run out, can&#x27;t wait to try other varieties and sizes</li>
    <li> These are really nice soap samples,  I really love all of them and I would buy them all again anytime.</li>
    <li> A lovely assortment of beautifully fragranced all natural soaps.  In my opinion, well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was expecting larger bars. The bars do smell good, but you pay a lot of a little. These are like hotel size bars.</li>
    <li> I am not a Petulli fan so did not like that soap. I loved the other kinds and enjoy the small bars for a nice change. I got this just as a sampler to see if I would order a larger bar of any of them. There are a couple I really liked so I feel this sampler did what I wanted it to, I plan on buying some larger bars.</li>
    <li> I rated it 4 stars because I never get too excited about soap.  That said, it was a great easy gift for the price.  I will order more just to have on hand when I need a gift for a coworker, sister or the girl next door.</li>
    <li> Theres nothing wrong with the product, except I don&#x27;t like most of the scents - but that&#x27;s just me, your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> I gave these as Christmas gifts and everyone raved about how nice they smelled. I love the idea that they are made out of 100% essential oils.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for gifts. They arrived in a very decent amount of time. The company does not provide gift wrapping, so I had to wrap it up in colored tissue paper myself and put a decorative tie on it. It is smaller than I had anticipated (maybe three inches tall?), but to be fair, I forgot to check how small they are before ordering. They are gifts for people I hardly know, and I think are more than adequate. The price is reasonable and handmade soaps are a really nice gift. One person on this site complained that there is not much separation between the soaps and the scents \\&quot;blend together\\&quot;. This is true about the separation; I can&#x27;t comment on the scents blending together because I am not going to use them; I&#x27;m giving them away. I think the entire scent is heavenly. When I opened the package I loved it! So I can&#x27;t pick out a favorite scent. The package, although scantily wrapped, is more earth-friendly because of not using plastic, and the simple paper that it comes in is fine for me. If I needed a \\&quot;better\\&quot; gift, it would have cost more. I think the people who receive these will be happy- I sure would! I wish I could use them myself! I am enjoying having them in my suitcase. All in all it serves well as a nice gift and was not expensive and smells great.</li>
    <li> while very nice use and smell very small picture decieving guess shouldve read description better but would be nice as guest soap was going to give as gift but kept instead</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this soap much. It&#x27;s relatively expensive for an idea that&#x27;s been catching wind for a while. The lather didn&#x27;t last long causing me to use the soap quickly. Not interested in buying again.</li>
    <li> Lots of good variety and smell. Its a great way to try the product. Yes, the product will get used quickly. BE SURE to store where it can dry after usage and not sit in moisture.</li>
    <li> They smelled amazing and they were the perfect gift for my boss for Christmas!</li>
    <li> The sampler soaps have great scent...although I must point out that I ordered the regular size sopa of one of the samplers and the scent was not as near as noticeable. It seems to me the samplers are added more fragrance or ingredients than the regular soaps....so bottomline...the sampler is good for handwash soap...the regular size stuff...not so good.</li>
    <li> Simply put, it works great.</li>
    <li> Like the variety and scents.  Great quality.  Great price compared to full sized bars.  Great for guest bath. Get it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the sampler! Perfect size use as hand soaps or traveling. The sampler gave me an idea for which soaps I&#x27;d like to order in the larger size.</li>
