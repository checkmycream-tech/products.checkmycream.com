      <li>I just wish it was as good as the hand balm, which does have a light wintergreen scent</li>
      <li>Wow this stuff is amazing!!</li>
      <li>Just one application and my cuticles are noticeable better.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I use this cuticle balm as needed (but I should probably use it more often than I do).</li>
      <li>it was okay</li>
      <li>I love the feel of the product on my cuticles, and the ease of application from the tin.  </li>
      <li>Badger products are always a favorite.  </li>
      <li>This does an outstanding job on cracked / split finger tips.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it most days</li>
      <li>Love Badger products and</li>
      <li>this is my favorite cuticle balm.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard that these tins rust, so I&#x27;ll be keeping it safe in my purse.</li>
      <li>This is a purse size container with cute logo on it.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this every day this winter and my fingers and cuticles are way better.</li>
      <li>I seriously love this stuff and use it every day.</li>
      <li>Now that I actually have the product I think it smells refreshing and wonderful.  </li>
      <li>My fingers feel moisturized and lovely after using and I have about 5 tins of these scattered around my work and home.</li>
      <li>It also has a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>I love Badger products.  </li>
      <li>This time around I was fortunate to end up loving the product.</li>
      <li>makes my nails look a lot better.</li>
      <li>I love to apply a layer to my cuticles and nails before I go to bed at night.</li>
      <li>Feels very nice on cuticles-- a bit oily, but it moisturized very well.</li>
      <li>and it was doing a pretty good job on my skin but didn&#x27;t faze the hang nails on my cuticles.</li>
      <li>looks cute, easy to use and carry in a pocket or bag.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found the &#x27;Badger Nutmeg &amp; Shea&#x27; works very bit as good as this cuticle cream for split finger tips.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very mild.</li>
      <li>but once the heat of your fingers rub the contents, the substance seems to melt and makes it quite easy to apply to the cuticles.  </li>
      <li>Skin soaks it up very quickly.</li>
      <li>The smell can be strong but not overly strong.  </li>
      <li>of course both of these, and several Badger products are great on cuticles, chapped knuckles, elbows, feet.</li>
      <li>I put this on my cuticles at night and by the morning they are moisturizer and smooth.</li>
      <li>Use it every night and you will see the difference right away!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff so, so much.</li>
      <li>The lemon scent is strong but disappears pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I have actually used this balm on my feet  for my toes and it has made my feet look awesome, so I started to use it on my hands again but only at night so that I don&#x27;t get it on everything.</li>
      <li>I love all Badger balms because they are all natural!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend !!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really oily which is fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually an amazing balm when I manicure my nails every week - it makes the nails and cuticles soft and the moisture really stays in the skin.</li>
      <li>I bite my cuticles as well, so having used this more frequently since I got it</li>
      <li>It may be a bit greasier than I&#x27;d have liked initially, but I think it was because I was comparing it to the hand balm....</li>
      <li>When I saw the cuticle cream I thought it was worth investigating.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and cuticle oils but this is by the far the absolute best.</li>
      <li>My hands and fingers are so much more comfortable not that my cuticles aren&#x27;t overly dry.  </li>
      <li>while that is an amazing balm as well, I think the cuticle care balm needs to have a bit more in there to soften up the cuticles, so since I use it more at night, I&#x27;d say I don&#x27;t mind it being a little greasier than the other balms.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
      <li>Well, it&#x27;s been almost a month since my first impression review of this cuticle balm and I needed to post an updated opinion.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of the product, and it goes on easily without it being messy.</li>
      <li>The scents of their other products are nice ..</li>
      <li>the only thing people might not like that it has &amp;#34;citronella&amp;#34; -like strong scent.</li>
      <li>NOT greasy, unless you use to much.</li>
      <li>but is very greasy.</li>

    <li> granddaughter has no more hang nails</li>
    <li> I love this! I keep it in my desk at work. I use it almost every day and my cuticles are perfect. If I forget to use it I can tell the difference with in a week. Just one application and my cuticles are noticeable better.</li>
    <li> Like all Badger products this is awesome.  It heals cracked and peeling skin around your nails.  Great for ladies weekly manicures and guys who have over worked and under cared for dry hands.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve found to heal my cuticles.  Use it every night and you will see the difference right away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 month and still have 1/3 left. I love this stuff, NO MORE DRY OR CRACKED CUTICLES. i use it on feet and hands. makes my nails look a lot better. very moisturizing, no need to reapply it often. can be just a tiny bit gritty like a shea butter. the only thing people might not like that it has &amp;#34;citronella&amp;#34; -like strong scent. I usually don&#x27;t like strong scents but don&#x27;t mind this one. I like aluminum jar. looks cute, easy to use and carry in a pocket or bag. ill buy more when I ran out</li>
    <li> This product seems to work well but is very greasy. scent is not too bad.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for my poor cuticles and just after a couple uses this has made them so much better! I can&#x27;t wait to see how well it helps my cuticles after a few weeks of using this. It smells good too. I love all Badger products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Feels very nice on cuticles-- a bit oily, but it moisturized very well. I&#x27;ve heard that these tins rust, so I&#x27;ll be keeping it safe in my purse. I also really enjoyed the smell!</li>
    <li> I put this on night before bedtime and I wake up with brand new cuticles. This is the best product for nails that I have ever used. FANTASTIC !!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better or worse than any other cuticle product. I guess mine are bad enough that nothing helps.</li>
    <li> I put this on my cuticles at night and by the morning they are moisturizer and smooth. Also bought one for my sister!</li>
    <li> Good but greasy and had a nice smell</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for Nails &amp; Cuticles.</li>
    <li> This product keeps cuticles soft even in the dead of winter when heat is on and air is dry. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love Badger products.  The Cuticle Care works great as it helps my fingernails look taken care of and it helps curb the the cuticle problem.</li>
    <li> The balm works for my cuticles.  I put it on during the day at anytime, before I go to bed and when I do the dishes, I put some on then gloves.  Works great.  The smell can be strong but not overly strong.  I will purchase again.  Oh and you do get a decent amount for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased on Amazon. A little bit of the salve goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue, so I don&#x27;t mind that I have to reapply it after I wash my hands. The fragrance is lemony and nice.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  My hands and fingers are so much more comfortable not that my cuticles aren&#x27;t overly dry.  I&#x27;ve read reviews that the smell of this product is obnoxious which concerned me but I tried it anyway because I don&#x27;t want to worry about harmful chemicals in the products that I use. Now that I actually have the product I think it smells refreshing and wonderful.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not really sure how much it does but it has an AWESOME smell. My friend also borrowed some and put it on her elbow which was incredibly dry and it helped her a LOT.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I was on a kick on day and purchased a ton of Badger products ... and loved everything I purchased.  Lip Balms, Body Balms ... The scents of their other products are nice .. however, I found this scent not so pleasant.  I love the feel of the product on my cuticles, and the ease of application from the tin.  Product shipped within time frame expected, and well packaged.  Will purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> This does an outstanding job on cracked / split finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;It takes the soreness away the first day, and has started healing the split by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a firm buttery consistency, with a slight lemony smell.&lt;br /&gt;A little oily, but most gets rubbed in and the rest soon soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This &#x27;Badger cuticle cream&#x27; -  contains Shea butter (Butyrospermum parkii) &#x3D; WEIGHTS 3/4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;( Main ingredients, Shea butter - olive oil - castor seed oil - beeswax - geranium flower oil - seabuckthorn fruit extract -&lt;br /&gt;mandarin peel oil - ginger root extract - leamongrass leaf oil - cardamom fruit oil - rosemary verbenone flower oil - listin fruit oil )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Also purchased &#x27;Badger Nutmeg &amp; Shea - contains Shea butter (Vitellaria paradoxa) &#x3D; WEIGHTS 2 oz&lt;br /&gt;( Main ingredients, Shea butter - beeswax - castor oil - olive oil - nutmeg - seabuckthorn berry - rosehip - rosemary )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Wikipedia says \\&quot;Shes butter Vitellaria paradoxa\\&quot; was previously called \\&quot;Shes butter Butyrospermum parkii\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the &#x27;Badger Nutmeg &amp; Shea&#x27; works very bit as good as this cuticle cream for split finger tips. (little better value)&lt;br /&gt;And of course both of these, and several Badger products are great on cuticles, chapped knuckles, elbows, feet.</li>
    <li> Of the three Badger balms I bought, this one is the one I didn&#x27;t care for. To me, it felt very greasy and it didn&#x27;t absorb into my hands/cuticles half as well as the Badger Hard Working Hands balm, which is pretty awesome. The smell of the Cuticle balm isn&#x27;t necessarily bad - it&#x27;s sort of got a citrus/lemon smell, which is nice, but it is definitely a bit on the strong side. I just wish it was as good as the hand balm, which does have a light wintergreen scent but it&#x27;s very mild. Overall, I&#x27;d say this balm just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for for my cuticles.  UPDATE: Well, it&#x27;s been almost a month since my first impression review of this cuticle balm and I needed to post an updated opinion. While the greasy nature of this balm is still there, I do find that it will absorb into my skin if I just wait a little bit. I have actually used this balm on my feet  for my toes and it has made my feet look awesome, so I started to use it on my hands again but only at night so that I don&#x27;t get it on everything. It&#x27;s actually an amazing balm when I manicure my nails every week - it makes the nails and cuticles soft and the moisture really stays in the skin. I bite my cuticles as well, so having used this more frequently since I got it I&#x27;ve noticed that the skin on my nails is a lot smoother and healthier looking. It may be a bit greasier than I&#x27;d have liked initially, but I think it was because I was comparing it to the hand balm....while that is an amazing balm as well, I think the cuticle care balm needs to have a bit more in there to soften up the cuticles, so since I use it more at night, I&#x27;d say I don&#x27;t mind it being a little greasier than the other balms. So, I would definitely up my initial review of 2 stars to 4 stars. Sometimes you just have to wait it out and see how something will work. This time around I was fortunate to end up loving the product.</li>
    <li> I bought some cuticle care for my nail beds and it works perfectly at softening my cuticles. It also did wonders for my nails, I always apply it after I remove my nail polish. It worked so well I bought some for my physical therapist, who has chronically dry and split nails. He was very impressed not only how well but how quickly it worked. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Has helped my cuticles from drying out and cracking.  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> This tin was smaller than I expected, but the product is great for cracked cuticles brought on by the cold!</li>
    <li> This is a purse size container with cute logo on it.  I love the smell of the product, and it goes on easily without it being messy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. I&#x27;ve had absolutely HORRIBLE cuticles for as long as I can remember, and I have a tendency to pick at them, especially when I&#x27;m stressed out. I&#x27;ve tried other products and cuticle oils but this is by the far the absolute best. I love the little shea beads throughout and how it seems to melt into my fingers as I apply it. I would definitely recommend using this product regularly, every once in a while won&#x27;t cut it. I do it at least once a day, usually at night before bed, but if I&#x27;m just sitting around sometimes I&#x27;ll do it then, too. Would 100% recommend and will definitely be buying again myself!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so, so much. I went from picking at my cuticles all the time to putting this on every time I found a hangnail. Within about two months, I stopped ever having hangnails. Amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> Tried over 30 products before this. None worked! This is the only one that helped heal my cuticles and skin around.  Works very good. NOT greasy, unless you use to much. IT has a shinny color / look after applied. Skin soaks it up very quickly. This is a high quality product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my cuticles are always peeling and bleeding. I use this cuticle balm as needed (but I should probably use it more often than I do). It has a pleasant smell too. Be careful that you don&#x27;t need your fingers for much when you have it on at first. It takes a little to sink into the skin and you don&#x27;t want it to rub off. Also, don&#x27;t expect a miracle in just a couple uses. I did notice some improvements, but you need to keep using it and give it time. Overall, I really like this and all other Badger products!</li>
    <li> Love this balm!  Will definitely buy it again!  I love all Badger balms because they are all natural!</li>
    <li> I seriously love this stuff and use it every day. I push it into the cuticle of each nail and use it around my fingers too as a lotion. It takes a little while to soak in and feels greasy so don&#x27;t shake anyones hands within a few minutes of using this product. It smells great too, but not to strong and chemically. My fingers feel moisturized and lovely after using and I have about 5 tins of these scattered around my work and home. It doesn&#x27;t last very long for me as I use A LOT each time, but worth getting more.</li>
    <li> best cuticle care.....easy to use</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been using body butter from The B*dy Sh*p and it was doing a pretty good job on my skin but didn&#x27;t faze the hang nails on my cuticles. I tried this and within 3 days my cuticles are perfect and so soft. I even use it on my elbow skin and it is amazing!  I love it!! It should last along time even in this little tin, but when I run out, I definitely plan to repurchase it again.  Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day this winter and my fingers and cuticles are way better. The lemon scent is strong but disappears pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> wonderful, I so love this. No more dry cuticles. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Cuticles are soft after just a week of use</li>
    <li> My friend told me that after one use she could see a difference.  I have purchased Badger products for myself and have liked them all.</li>
    <li> This balm for cuticle revitalization is an excellent product. I use it most days and it&#x27;s great for growing your nails.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve chewed on my cuticles and nails for years. My nails and cuticles have always been an embarrassment. This product immediately began softening and moisturizing my cuticles, making it much easier for me to keep from picking and chewing on them. Wonder of wonders, the actual new nails are growing in much smoother. I use it 2-3 times during the day, and every night. It is a little greasy, but doesn&#x27;t take long to soak in. I&#x27;ve used other well known cuticle repair products in the past, but nothing has even come close to giving me the results this has. I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after a particularly terrible winter left my cuticles and fingers dry, chapped, and cracked. I had never used anything like this before, just slathered lotion all over my hands. This stuff is amazing and it smells delicious. Right away my cuticles were no longer painful and after a week of use they were soft and supple like never before. I love to apply a layer to my cuticles and nails before I go to bed at night. My nails and cuticles are now healthier than ever. My nails are thicker, stronger, and less prone to chipping or breaking. Also they just look amazing! My cuticles are soft and much easier to work with. Also this little tin seems to last forever. I have been using it pretty regularly for almost a year and I have barely made a dent in it.</li>
    <li> This is okayyyy, I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for it though I&#x27;d pay about $3.50 for this. It&#x27;s really oily which is fine I understand why, but for me at least it didn&#x27;t make my cuticles feel all that mostureized it was okay but it does smell nice. It smells like ginger.</li>
    <li> Yes, the best cuticle product ever.</li>
    <li> Love Badger products and this is my favorite cuticle balm.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is amazing!! Lasts forever, very oily but perfect for helping your cuticles/ nails. I swear by this product &amp; I love it. Will definitely be back for more in the future</li>
    <li> Packaged well and received in a speedy fashion.  The product itself seems a waxed consistency but once the heat of your fingers rub the contents, the substance seems to melt and makes it quite easy to apply to the cuticles.  I did see an improvement but find I need to use it on a regular basis.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my cuticle moisturized throughout the day.  Highly recommend !!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Badger Balm before when I worked with terra cotta pottery, it really helped to re-moisturize my hands. This little tin of magic does wonders on my cuticles.</li>
    <li> Badger products are always a favorite.  I&#x27;ve been using the classic Badger Balm on cuticles (and anywhere else that feels dry) for years.  When I saw the cuticle cream I thought it was worth investigating.  It seems a little thicker than the traditional balm and does an excellent job of softening cuticles and dry or rough skin around nail beds.  It also has a lovely scent.</li>
