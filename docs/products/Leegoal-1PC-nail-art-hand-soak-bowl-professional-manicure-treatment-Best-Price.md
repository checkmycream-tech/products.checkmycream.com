      <li>one for each hand:)</li>
      <li>When you look at the picture, it appears that this has a lid that covers the top and closes to save the liquid inside.  </li>
      <li>so I can do manicures :)</li>
      <li>Better than foils for gel nails.</li>
      <li>Makes it more comfortable and heat makes chemical reactions that remove polish happen faster.</li>
      <li>Love these for soaking off acrylics fill bottom with hot water and top with acetone</li>
      <li>Just what I wanted &amp; spool cheap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like the bowl used in the nail salon and easy to clean up</li>
      <li>but what do you expect for that price &amp; free shipping....</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s free shipping</li>
      <li>Just add hot water to the bottom bowl, the acetone in the top.</li>
      <li>hot water in the bottom and nail remover solution in the top.</li>

      <li>being able to use hot water takes less time when removing acrylic and gel from nails.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend to those looking to soak off gelish quick.</li>
      <li>Little tabls attach the bottom to the top.  </li>
      <li>The wells are spaced nicely for my fingers but the part in the middle where you are supposed to rest your hands is too high leaving your wrist at and odd angle.  </li>
      <li>got it 8 days early and have no clue why I only order one</li>
      <li>Shipping came much faster than expected</li>

<li> It is a basic five-finger nail soaking dish made of plastic, that sits in a base.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s really not good for my carpal tunnel!</li>

    <li> All I can say is  awesome</li>
    <li> Not the brightest invention a little small but gets job done</li>
    <li> Shipping came faster then expected and I used it already does what its suppose to</li>
    <li> got it 8 days early and have no clue why I only order one lol but any ways I like it n im gonna order another one so I can do manicures :)</li>
    <li> I love my manicure hand soak bowl! It&#x27;s pretty, easy to wash and you can use the bottom as a storage!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to soak off my gelish. Functional and practical. Works as described. Would definitely recommend to those looking to soak off gelish quick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just like the bowl used in the nail salon and easy to clean up</li>

    <li> hot water in the bottom and nail remover solution in the top. it&#x27;s a good fit for both hands to relax at the same time. don&#x27;t have to get out my good bowls to soak my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two. one for each hand:)</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted &amp; spool cheap. Of course it took 6 weeks to get here with it&#x27;s free shipping but what do you expect for that price &amp; free shipping....</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> a unique and useful product. An all in one bowl that allows you to use hot water in the basin below to hasten the acetone removal of acrylic or gel nails. being able to use hot water takes less time when removing acrylic and gel from nails.</li>
    <li> I love it it&#x27;s amazing truly recommend</li>
    <li> It is big and cute, love it</li>
    <li> These are used as warming bowls. The previous review thought it was a lids, but you actually fill the bottom bowl with warm water then put acetone in the top bowl. Makes it more comfortable and heat makes chemical reactions that remove polish happen faster. They use them in my salon and they&#x27;re a must have for gel nail removal</li>
    <li> When you look at the picture, it appears that this has a lid that covers the top and closes to save the liquid inside.  Not so.  I chose it because it looked like it had a latching cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why this is in two pieces that latch together.  However, there is no purpose in the bottom piece, except perhaps some stability.  It is a basic five-finger nail soaking dish made of plastic, that sits in a base.  Little tabls attach the bottom to the top.  There is no lid and it doesn&#x27;t close.  It is a bit bulky but will do the job.</li>
    <li> Love these for soaking off acrylics fill bottom with hot water and top with acetone very useful arrived on time package very well</li>
    <li> Took a long time to arrive but came packaged nicely. It&#x27;s simple and comfortable to use. Just add hot water to the bottom bowl, the acetone in the top. My only complaint is how hard it is to pour the acetone out of the bowl. It spills all over the place if you&#x27;re trying to pour it back into the skinny opening of a polish remover bottle. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m going to manage that in the future.</li>
    <li> Better than foils for gel nails.</li>
