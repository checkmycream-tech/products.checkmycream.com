      <li>This product is great for the quick way to smoth lips and to feel happy about no cracks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m SO glad I got the pack of three!</li>
      <li>This has a very pleasant scent and a slightly better taste than the original Carmex.</li>

      <li>and its more of a cherry scent rather than flavor.</li>

      <li>came in a reasonable time period, I still do prefer carmex lip balm cherry in tube form because the whole squeezy thing is a bit messy</li>
      <li>I LOVE regular Carmex, but this stuff was not good.</li>
      <li>I generally use Neutrogena lip balm SPF 15 which is the same as Chap Stick SPF 15 without the 40% petrolatum.</li>

    <li> I generally use Neutrogena lip balm SPF 15 which is the same as Chap Stick SPF 15 without the 40% petrolatum. Neutrogena is clear, none tasting, no perfume, no wax, no PABA which is hard to find otherwise it has the same ingredients of Octinoxate and Oxybenzone. Neutrogena is great when I am mountain biking but not great 1)in real hot weather or 2)surfing in the ocean. For that I use Carmex 15 in the tube since 1)tube is the best to hold in the ingredients when melting 2)nothing offers the protection of the petrolatum in the salty water of the ocean. Carmex is 90% Vaseline+wax but in a small tube with SPF 15.</li>
    <li> They are great for winter and you can use it as a lips scrub</li>
    <li> Carmex is my answer for chapped lips!  I have tried several lip balm and chap stick lines, but nothing comes close for Carmex for me.  It&#x27;s quick acting and can treat my severely chapped and cracked lips instantly.  This has a very pleasant scent and a slightly better taste than the original Carmex. I keep several tubes of this stuff handy.  My entire family uses it!</li>
    <li> THIS IS HOW LIP BALMS SHOULD ACTUALLY WORK!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE regular Carmex, but this stuff was not good. Smelled like cherry cough syrup and was much thinner than regular Carmex. Also tasted very bitter.</li>
    <li> Love it and the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> this product is great at getting rid of chapped lips and making them feel soft and kissable. try this once and you will be a return coustemer.</li>

    <li> This is nice and convenient with little mess as you don&#x27;t have to worry about it melting like the sticks do if left in a hot car.  The product is wonderful and really does a great job of keeping your lips comfortable in hot or cold weather.</li>
    <li> I use this lip balm all the time. It gives a lot of soothing moisture to dry lips. I have both the stick and the tubes. The stick has a tendency to melt. However, I would recommend it to anyone with dry lips.</li>
    <li> wife really likes this product</li>
    <li> Can never go wrong with a basic.</li>
    <li> nothing really to tell.  its the same thing you buy at the drug store or wal mart.  and its more of a cherry scent rather than flavor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an aesthetician and makeup artist and I can tell you this is great product for dehydratated lips, totally recommed it!</li>
    <li> This Carmex lip balm is just the thing for dry lips and it&#x27;s also a sun screen, which is an added plus.  My girlfriend loves the taste of it.  I am constantly applying more.  What else can I say?  If you have dry lips, or a girlfriend, use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I got the pack of three! I keep these everywhere, in my bathroom, my car, my purse, at work. This balm hydrates your lips with the subtle smell of cherry. Perfect! Why are you even reading this?! Buy it now!!</li>
    <li> Good to have in my pocket or work bag. Never catch me with dry lips lol! The cherry is an added bonus to keeping those lips smelling great.</li>
