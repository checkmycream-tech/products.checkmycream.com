    <li> Love this stuff.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I Love this product. I do rinse it out. I use it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine textured hair</li>
    <li> Just got this today. It was a great price and I can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  My hair is thick, coarse and wiry. (sigh).  This helps leave it smooth and soft so when I flat iron I don&#x27;t have to use heavy oil any more. Coupled with my Biolage conditioner my hair is in the best shape ever!</li>
    <li> loved it soooooo much! please, try it, i recommend... it&#x27;s a light cream that makes a revolution on your hair</li>
    <li> Not my style.  Too much scent</li>
    <li> I use the &amp;#34;Smooth Cure&amp;#34; treatment on my towel-dried hair, and then allow it to air dry.  My hair is slightly curly, but has a lot of frizz at the crown, and this product works for days between shampoos, though of course you can use more before styling if desired.  &amp;#34;Smooth Cure&amp;#34; is a medium consistency lotion that dispenses easily from the pump, but doesn&#x27;t drip from your hands before or while you&#x27;re applying it to your hair.  My hair is of medium-to-thick texture, and just above shoulder length, and I find that I need 7-8 pumps of product instead of the 3-5 instructed on the bottle&#x27;s directions.  I&#x27;m particularly happy with &amp;#34;Smooth Cure&amp;#34;, given its reasonable price.[[ASIN:B005K9HXJM Joico Smooth Cure Leave In Rescue Treatment 3.4 oz]]</li>
    <li> I havent had time to really use the product yet but so far I like the way it felt.  will see in a few days as I just put on daughters hair.&lt;br /&gt;Well now I&#x27;ve used the product and I really liked it.  It has a built in thermal protector which I just love and it really made flat ironing easy and the hair glided through the iron.  More importantly, made the hair soft.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is much cheaper on Amazon than at my hair salon. Always look here before I purchased any item especially in hair products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make any difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I love all Joico products but especially this one.  A little bit seems to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly/frizzy hair and it works very well to tame the frizz!  I also swim laps and it helps keep my hair from feeling like straw.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product actually changed my hair. My hair is no longer wiry, unruly or frizzy. I use the Joico Smooth Cure Shampoo and Conditioner and then the Leave-In Treatment. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products but this one ACTUALLY WORKS!!  The texture is now smooth instead of being coarse and unruly due to hair color and blow drying damage. I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works like a charm on curly/frizzy hair. It&#x27;s very lightweight and it WORKS. I searched for YEARS to find a product that wouldn&#x27;t weight my already heavy hair down and Joico (the entire line) does the trick. Even if you don&#x27;t blow dry your hair, it still dries with beautiful shine and smoothness. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> First of all, the packaging was not so great- I&#x27;m surprised the tube didn&#x27;t fall out in shipment!  I was really excited to try this, and I&#x27;m sad to say that it simply does nothing for my hair.  It made my hair rough; I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it like I normally can when I use other hair products.  I tried using it in all manners- but it still doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I have thick, coarse, long and dull hair.  Sadly, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Keeps my wavy hair smooth and frizz-free, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and is very non-greasy on the hands and hair.  Good scent too.</li>
    <li> This product is ok  its more smoothing not so much shine . My son loves using it. I gguess if I washed my hair often  I might use this product more  I  don&#x27;t like to weigh my hair down then I have to wash it I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair too often kinda like it to look kinda beacchy  don&#x27;t like to attract dirt on the hair . its ok product</li>
    <li> I have super curly hair and live in an intensely humid climate so when I bought this \\&quot;Smooth Cure\\&quot; I was hoping it would do something for the frizz created by all that humidity.  It didn&#x27;t do a thing.  Nada. For my hair, it was a waste of money.  Hopefully that is not the case for anybody else.</li>
    <li> The only product I need to use!</li>
    <li> Love love love this! It&#x27;s just the right about of texture but doesn&#x27;t weigh down the curls!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but love Joico.</li>
    <li> Protects from heat damage and makes it easy to straighten your hair with your hot iron.  A little goes a long way! Apply to clean wet hair, let dry and then straighten.</li>
    <li> My ends of my hair are frizzy, i put this product in my hair when damp, and blow dry it and no more frizzy ness. Do recommand.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Thanks for making it easily available and I received it quickly.</li>
    <li> Works best after washing hair and blow drying although I sometimes put it in and let it air dry. Works great with the thermal styling protectant.</li>
