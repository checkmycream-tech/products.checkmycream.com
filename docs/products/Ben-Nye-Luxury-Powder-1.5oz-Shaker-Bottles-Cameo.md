      <li>now my favorite.</li>
      <li>Truthfully it&#x27;s just corn starch.</li>

      <li>and I love both of them.</li>
      <li>phenomenal finishing powder.  </li>
      <li>The make up held all day through sunshine, sweaty, tears and hours of dancing and was shine free!</li>
      <li>The stuff lives up to its hype for sure.  </li>
      <li>I love anything Ben Nye.  </li>
      <li>Love how it makes my undereyes look</li>
      <li>So my favorite highlight to sculpt the face is in a duo from Marc Jacobs.  </li>
      <li>I really love this powder for setting my foundation.  </li>
      <li>I would recomment it for oily skins it sets more nicer.</li>
      <li>, which I thought it would blend better with my tone....</li>
      <li>Did a ok job for my oily skin but for 3 hrs.</li>
      <li>Love how fine this powder is, but it didn&#x27;t brighten as well as I was hoping for</li>
      <li>The powder is velvety soft since it is finely milled and it goes on the skin so beautifully.</li>
      <li>Is fantastic and even better than the MJ one.  </li>
      <li>Good powder, very matte and silky</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very finely milled and a perfect setting powder for under the eye area for my pale skin tone.</li>
      <li>so it is easy to pack on.  </li>
      <li>Other then that I love it!!!</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful setting powder.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into pores and fine lines.</li>
      <li>Absolute love it !</li>
      <li>I have also gotten NUMEROUS complements about how great my makeup looks since purchasing this.</li>
      <li>The cameo powder was like the cheap all over body powder you can buy at any drug store.</li>
      <li>It is so light and sets concealer and foundation like a dream, without making you look cakey.</li>
      <li>Be sure to school yourself in the right color to buy.. then buy it.</li>
      <li>The actual color is nice to highlight  for medium tones but the coverage was marginal and because my skin is so dry it wasn&#x27;t a perfect find.</li>
      <li>It takes something pretty light to actually highlight my skin and this is it because it has a beautiful pinky tone like my undertone.  </li>
      <li>I love to use a translucent powder to set first and then brighten with this.  </li>
      <li>Not at all what I expected I wanted better coverage because I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
      <li>very smooth look that really camouflages imperfections well.  </li>
      <li>I heard so much about this product, but it is just OK.</li>
      <li>It is still full.</li>
      <li>These powders are an absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>Finally I found a good setting powder.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares, but it&#x27;s really good for what I&#x27;m using it for!</li>
      <li>,, not the banana yellow one that seems to be popular.</li>
      <li>Stepped up my flawless skin game</li>
      <li>I tried to use it for contouring, didn&#x27;t see any difference, color just blends right away.</li>
      <li>Will last for months if not 6 or more.</li>
      <li>The cameo has a nice hint of pink that helps reflect the darkness under my eyes.</li>
      <li>It does provide a pretty matte finish that lasts all day with zero creasing.  </li>
      <li>If you are somewhat fair,  slight pink and definite blue undertones,  then the cameo shade will work perfectly.  </li>
      <li>, this is a very very light and loose powder, at first I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had put it on</li>
      <li>so I mix a little bit of my bare minerals powder foundation with this powder and it works great.</li>
      <li>I am of southeast asian decent and use the cameo more often since I have more of a pink undertone</li>
      <li>I appreciate the price and the fast shipping from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Very blendable and does not give a &amp;#34;covered&amp;#34; appearance.</li>
      <li>Definitely gives a smooth finish, but I was under the impression that it would highlight my face</li>
      <li>not what I really accept a get</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough to use as a highlight.</li>
      <li>Came quickly, like the small size because I wasn&#x27;t sure if the color was for me.</li>
      <li>My bottle is still full and it takes months to get through the smaller container</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have a retailer then go for this one, but if you could find a costume shop that carries the brand I would highly suggest making the trip and saving money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried to use it for contouring, didn&#x27;t see any difference, color just blends right away.</li>
    <li> Wish it had a little cup where the holes are that the powder comes out of.  Not sure if that makes sense or not, but kinda like the bare minerals containers.</li>
    <li> Great. I love this powder.</li>
    <li> I heard so much about this product, but it is just OK.</li>
    <li> Good but does not last long hours as stated and reviewed by many. Did a ok job for my oily skin but for 3 hrs.</li>
    <li> I really love this powder for setting my foundation.  I get the shade cameo and it&#x27;s beautiful.  It really helps give my skin a flawless finish.  I do sometimes have to reapply later in the day,  but it never looks flaky.  I&#x27;ve used it over lancome, MAC, CK, Lorac and Revlon colorstay foundations with great results on each.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know which shade to order so I mix a little bit of my bare minerals powder foundation with this powder and it works great. I like the coverage without the heavy makeup look. I believe these products, are used by theatrical makeup artist.</li>
    <li> The stuff lives up to its hype for sure.  Makes my makeup and face look as close to flawless as is possible.  Has a very light feel,  very smooth look that really camouflages imperfections well.  Also after using it for a month,  Zero breakouts.  If you are somewhat fair,  slight pink and definite blue undertones,  then the cameo shade will work perfectly.  And although the container is small,  the powder is very fine and there is A LOT in the container.  I would not open all the holes,  perhaps only half of them so that too much doesn&#x27;t spill out.  I have also gotten NUMEROUS complements about how great my makeup looks since purchasing this.</li>
    <li> being fair skinned it&#x27;s hard to find a powder that is both light enough and fine enough to set under eye concealer without being too dark for my skin tone but This powder is perfect. It&#x27;s very fine so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey. It&#x27;s light enough to use as a highlight. It doesn&#x27;t settle into pores and fine lines. It&#x27;s perfection.</li>
    <li> Good powder. Definitely gives a smooth finish, but I was under the impression that it would highlight my face but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This powder is brightening as well as mattefying.</li>
    <li> Good powder, very matte and silky</li>
    <li> AMAZING product for highlighting on fair skin. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this to wipe on my dog&#x27;s but to stop the itching. It works well and my dog does not mind the flavor. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The actual color is nice to highlight  for medium tones but the coverage was marginal and because my skin is so dry it wasn&#x27;t a perfect find.</li>
    <li> I own the luxury powders in Cameo and Banana and I love both of them. The powder is velvety soft since it is finely milled and it goes on the skin so beautifully. I am of southeast asian decent and use the cameo more often since I have more of a pink undertone but I have friends that have a yellow undertone and used Cameo and it comes out translucent. The only thing I dislike is the packaging. It is extremely messy to pour out the product and they should change it. This is where this product lost a star.</li>
    <li> I use this over my foundation and it helps it set very nicely. I haven&#x27;t used any similar powders from other brands so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares, but it&#x27;s really good for what I&#x27;m using it for!</li>
    <li> 3 stars because I love this stuff, but not $13.95 + shipping for a 1.5oz ?!  That is insane. There is a small costume shop where I live that sells it for $7. Look for retailers in your area that carry it for a lot less money.  This stuff will last you a VERY long time. I have had the banana powder in the 3oz bottle for 2 years now.  It is still full. I pour it into an empty jar from Makeup Forever (HD translucent powder from Sephora ) to make it more convenient to use. My bottle is still full and it takes months to get through the smaller container I empty it into.  I paid $15 for the larger 3oz at the costume shop.  If you don&#x27;t have a retailer then go for this one, but if you could find a costume shop that carries the brand I would highly suggest making the trip and saving money.</li>
    <li> This powder looks great on. I am super pale and ordered cameo. It covers nicely, but is not super heavy. It does not take the place of foundation, but works great over foundation.</li>
    <li> Amazing i cant say enoygh great things about this powder will deff be purchasing again and again for my kit</li>
    <li> I ordered what I saw in the picture but I received something else! not what I really accept a get</li>
    <li> I may have gotten the wrong color, I ordered the beige powder.,, not the banana yellow one that seems to be popular. I just don&#x27;t get the hype ,</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Such a beautiful setting powder. Do not hesitate to order! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Omg. .. Love this face powder! It is very true this will not crease either! Will purchase again this is no joke is a must have</li>
    <li> This is the perfect setting powder for under eyes and T-zone if needed. It is so light and sets concealer and foundation like a dream, without making you look cakey. You also can&#x27;t beat the price. I ordered this because of a suggestion from a makeup artist friend. A makeup artist trick,  is to add qutie a bit under your eyes and let the body&#x27;s heat work its magic on the powder while you finish the rest of your face makeup, then wipe away with a big fluffy brush. You will never have creasing again!</li>
    <li> Hate the Cameon powder</li>
    <li> I love the cameo shade! I use it for under my eyes to set my concealer. I first tried the banana shade but it was too yellow for under my eyes. The cameo has a nice hint of pink that helps reflect the darkness under my eyes. The powder is flawless and leaves my skin looking airbrushed.</li>
    <li> Great powder. Very blendable and does not give a &amp;#34;covered&amp;#34; appearance. After a month I have not experienced any allergic reaction or breakout and does not bother my very sensitive eyes. Will last for months if not 6 or more. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> The cameo powder was like the cheap all over body powder you can buy at any drug store. You know the one with the giant poof? Truthfully it&#x27;s just corn starch. I&#x27;ll save money next time and just buy that instead of ordering this one.</li>
    <li> Finally I found a good setting powder. Be sure to school yourself in the right color to buy.. then buy it. This powder works great at setting foundation but not making my face look chalky.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t give a good enough description of what your getting. Also the picture is misleading. Other then that I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected I wanted better coverage because I&#x27;m fair skinned, this is a very very light and loose powder, at first I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had put it on but it made me even lighter?, which I thought it would blend better with my tone....i would say this is for very very light skin. NOT REALly SATISFIED CONsidering The price. Other reviews were misleading...</li>
    <li> Every women should have this product ! Absolute love it !</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Used it for setting my makeup for my friend&#x27;s wedding.  The make up held all day through sunshine, sweaty, tears and hours of dancing and was shine free!</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my undereyes look</li>
    <li> So my favorite highlight to sculpt the face is in a duo from Marc Jacobs.  $50 for that and I don&#x27;t use the contour everyday bc I don&#x27;t loooove it on my fair skin.  I would hate to have to keep buying that duo.  $50!  Now THIS powder... Is fantastic and even better than the MJ one.  I appreciate the price and the fast shipping from Amazon.  It takes something pretty light to actually highlight my skin and this is it because it has a beautiful pinky tone like my undertone.  I love to use a translucent powder to set first and then brighten with this.  I also really like cooking with the loose powder-- pack on product and let it sit while I do my eyes (which catches fallout) and then sweep it away later.  It just makes everything so fresh and perfect looking.  I really like that it is loose so it is easy to pack on.  It does provide a pretty matte finish that lasts all day with zero creasing.  By the end of the day my under eye does feel the slightest bit dry, but that&#x27;s normal for me.  This is something I will always have in my collection!  Thank you Ben Nye!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really nice! Very smooth with mat finish. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
    <li> Definitely not as good as I wxpecte d it to be a little disappointed</li>
    <li> These powders are an absolute favorite. I&#x27;d say it works best on those with normal skin but not the greatest on combination.</li>
    <li> Works GREAT!!! I purchased after watching people use it on YouTube and I loooooove it</li>
    <li> Love it! Stepped up my flawless skin game</li>
    <li> Excellent product . It brightens up the under eye area without leaving cakeness. I would recomment it for oily skins it sets more nicer.</li>
    <li> phenomenal finishing powder.  now my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love anything Ben Nye.  Excellent</li>
    <li> Love how fine this powder is, but it didn&#x27;t brighten as well as I was hoping for</li>
    <li> 1.5 grams is VERY small. Although you don&#x27;t need much at all, I was surprised when I saw the bottle.  VERY FINELY MILLED.  That makes it just glide and melt onto the skin.  Nice powder.</li>
    <li> Came quickly, like the small size because I wasn&#x27;t sure if the color was for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It&#x27;s very finely milled and a perfect setting powder for under the eye area for my pale skin tone. So happy with my purchase.</li>
