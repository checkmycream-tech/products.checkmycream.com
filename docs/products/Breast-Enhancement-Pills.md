      <li>AND  SHE WASNT HAPPY ABOUT IT</li>
      <li>Very Nicely Already.    </li>
      <li>it is charming.</li>
      <li>I took this product along with another that was suggested to go good with it, after just 9days</li>
      <li>Good luck to all.</li>
      <li>I good way to gain girth is to increase your protein intake</li>
      <li>this dose not work that good</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying I love this product!</li>
      <li>I could use more to speed up results (NOT THE PILLS!),</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of scared to take the pills now.</li>
      <li>You need to stick to it and follow the recommendations from their own site to achieve results.  </li>
      <li>NOW HER BREAST WAS NICE SIZE  </li>
      <li>Unlike others this is an honest review.</li>
      <li>I heard so many good responses on the pills (testimonials on natureday.com)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and makes breasts young again.</li>
      <li>I own this product for more than 5 months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of pissed because NatureDay website is elaborate with reviews and pictures which seem authentic but also makes me wonder,</li>
      <li>My breasts have filled out more and feel firmer, and plumper!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m gonna continue to use this product and post some more changes.</li>
      <li>so it becomes even greater.</li>
      <li>As you can guess the proprietary blend in Natureday pill for pill is a better value.  </li>
      <li>I am so Glad I gave this a Try</li>
      <li>all the way now i don&#x27;t even have to ajust them to make them feel comfortable!</li>
      <li>Have almost used it all and will probably get more soon.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ll update my review when/if any progress is made! :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using this product until i&#x27;m satisfied with my results</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>This way, although it takes longer, it&#x27;s safe, gradual and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe.</li>
      <li>I will be geting more when I start to run out.</li>
      <li>i have been take these pill s for all most three months</li>
      <li>I can feel the orgasm by touching the nipple.</li>
      <li>i read the views they are pretty good</li>
      <li>Also, the bottom portion of my breasts has filled out more so my nipples are moving up and are much more perky.</li>
      <li>SO SHE WANTED ME TO LOOK ON LINE AND FINE</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m happy , and my breasts are almost a C cup, if u want bigger breast, u have to follow the program, and stick to it , ur not gonna be a DD over night .</li>
      <li>But u will notice a difference and that&#x27;s the truth , any one who doesn&#x27;t buy this product , is missing out on the great results !!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the results and I would recommend anyone and everyone that wants bigger breasts.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s so much fun!</li>
      <li>I will most certainly update if I get any changes.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m now fitting a 42C cup bra and have quite large nipples (bonus)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m now a full 42B bra size and still growing</li>
      <li>As a male using this product I can say it is indeed a good product - in just one month</li>
      <li>I still considered myself not having the full breasts that I would like to match my body type.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend has no idea that I am on this treatment and has been wondering why my breasts are so full now.</li>
      <li>Await for a quick response.</li>
      <li>only gave it 4 stars because i&#x27;m not 100% sure whether it is the pueraria mirifica doing the magic or natureincs pills or cream or</li>
      <li>I bought these about a year before I got pregnant.</li>
      <li>I found this product easy to take and it seems to work very well.  </li>
      <li>It was worth it in my opinion, but my bf didn&#x27;t like it at the time</li>
      <li>: I emailed Natureday and they told me it&#x27;s rare</li>
      <li>THAT RIGHT</li>
      <li>As of right now there has been NONE</li>
      <li>This product caused me to start having hot flashes when I stopped taking it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because of the rate of growth I have, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have a D cup (I&#x27;m a C), by the time I finish the second bottle of pills or sooner (1 month and a week from now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have decided that these herbal supplements do not work very well, if at all!</li>
      <li>AT FIRST</li>
      <li>my chest has really gained a lot of tissue and growth - it may not be that obvious on the outside, but i definitely feel a lot more substance underneath the skin - amazing product, and provided one is eating healthy, it really does work...</li>
      <li>AT FIRST  NOWW FULLER AND  ROUNDER</li>
      <li>i am very displeased with this.</li>
      <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>pilss run not to fast  </li>
      <li>It didnot work for me ;( I guess as much an my hair was dropping a lot</li>
      <li>I had to end up getting real breast implants.  </li>
      <li>i really would like to try this product</li>
      <li>Thanks again Jay Booth</li>
      <li>This actually really works.</li>
      <li>+ testimonials, pictures of real people?....</li>
      <li>and I have grown soooooo much .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safer, cheaper and real.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much because you have saved here from wanting to get breast surgery.</li>
      <li>at all too much money buy something els</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been usining Fulfillment for 2 weeks now with the liquid and now im takeing the pills for week 3 it really dose work</li>
      <li>My breasts have significantly grown in size and my body feels different in a way</li>
      <li>the other stuff is better</li>
      <li>Natural plant estrogen isn&#x27;t strong enough to effect change.</li>
      <li>Tired with the self-esteem issues and not being able to find a properly fitting bra I started looking around online for ways to naturally grow my breasts.</li>
      <li>( I find that beef jerky and yogurt has a high amount of it), also take flax oil and a multivitamin.</li>
      <li>, now I&#x27;m about a 36A/B, a nearly C cup!!</li>
      <li>They arrived today (A DAY EARLY) which really made my day.</li>
      <li>I have always been real self conscious about my breast size</li>
      <li>I will update this review in a few more weeks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I own this product for more than 5 months. It really works. My breasts are size 0 to 2 z. I can feel the orgasm by touching the nipple. it is charming. velos so it becomes even greater. currently has an 95 under the breast, but above the 108 cm. This product i ues than liquid  to end. . pilss run not to fast  but it are use before bed. i am happy</li>
    <li> My Fiancee has gone from an A cup to a bursting B in only 4weeks from using your cream, drops, and pills we purchased last month from amazon. Thanks so much because you have saved here from wanting to get breast surgery.( the only thing is its going to cost me fortune for the new bra&#x27;s!!!, ( Luckily I got her a few ahh bras to keep her going until she reaches a C cup then I will get her new Bra&#x27;s)    Thanks again Jay Booth</li>
    <li> Got this along with the liquid and over 3 weeks have gained 1/2 in across bust.  You need to stick to it and follow the recommendations from their own site to achieve results.  Have almost used it all and will probably get more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this product. I can see little changes but not much. I&#x27;ll keep using this product until i&#x27;m satisfied with my results</li>
    <li> i have been take these pill s for all most three months an the nature day products work for men i am now a 36 b cup</li>
    <li> I was afraid to use it. and through away</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money product does not work. Natural plant estrogen isn&#x27;t strong enough to effect change. Unlike others this is an honest review.</li>
    <li> After almost a month I am starting to feel the effects.. My breasts have significantly grown in size and my body feels different in a way I cannot yet describe</li>
    <li> I have always been real self conscious about my breast size and I was looking for something to please let my breast grow and after searching on the Internet , I found nature day , I&#x27;m a 29 yr old female I have 2 kids , and my son is 2 months old, my breast were so flat, and just soggy , and droppy, but after takeing this product for a week , I noticed a difference , I have been on it for 2 months and I have got to say ,it&#x27;s wonderful , amazing , whatever word u wanna call it , I&#x27;m happy , and my breasts are almost a C cup, if u want bigger breast, u have to follow the program, and stick to it , ur not gonna be a DD over night . But u will notice a difference and that&#x27;s the truth , any one who doesn&#x27;t buy this product , is missing out on the great results !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this product works in such a short period of time. I am 5 7, my bra size is 38D. I still considered myself not having the full breasts that I would like to match my body type. It&#x27;s been close to a month now and I am seeing fuller cleavage and firmer breasts. My boyfriend has no idea that I am on this treatment and has been wondering why my breasts are so full now. I find that if I take the pills late in the evening and message the cream with the drops religiously every day 2x a day( morning and at night), I have seen a BIG change. Good luck to all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, and all I have to say is \\&quot;WOW!!\\&quot; I am 5&#x27;8, 145 pounds, and slim. When I started using this product, I was a 34B, now I&#x27;m about a 36A/B, a nearly C cup!! My nipples are sensitive sometimes, so I know it&#x27;s working! My boyfriend even noticed the difference!! He couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off of them!! I&#x27;m gonna continue to use this product and post some more changes. I good way to gain girth is to increase your protein intake ( I find that beef jerky and yogurt has a high amount of it), also take flax oil and a multivitamin. Just saying, before I used this product, I felt like I was clutching small pears, now I feel like I&#x27;m clutching large oranges!!!</li>
    <li> Oh My Goodness,     I&#x27;ve been Takin this for Almost 3 weeks now, and I have Noticed I&#x27;m fillin out Very Nicely Already.    I went out to the Club Braless for the first time Ever this Past weekend and didn&#x27;t feel self conscious.    The Side Effect of Increased Libido is a bit of a Plus as well ;p.    I am so Glad I gave this a Try I will continue takin this, and will try to Keep a Report of my Progress.    I&#x27;m a Very Happy Fairy Gurl</li>
    <li> I heard so many good responses on the pills (testimonials on natureday.com) so I went ahead and bought them. I took them for probably three or four days and I started my period about a week and a half early!! /: I emailed Natureday and they told me it&#x27;s rare but they have had some women say that. So I quit taking the pills, liquid and using the cream after that which was a little over a month and a half ago. And started drinking caffeine again. But I am planning on starting back up with no caffeine tomorrow!! And start using the liquid and cream. I&#x27;m kind of scared to take the pills now. I might start taking them a week before my period to test it out.... (: Hope the pills work out for anyone else!!</li>
    <li> I bought the entire NatureDay system directly from their website as Amazon does not sell the system together which includes the pills, cream and liquid. I have used all 3 religiously about 85% of the time all together and always I use at least one of the products daily, which according to natureday is more than enough for sufficient results. I am a perky 34A and although I am 100% happy with my body I figured what the heck a full B wouldn&#x27;t be half bad. I got ZERO results from this system. ZILCH, NADA, NOTHING!! I&#x27;m kind of pissed because NatureDay website is elaborate with reviews and pictures which seem authentic but also makes me wonder, hmmmmm.     Anyway, I will continue my 2 bottles and cream I have left as I paid over $200 for it. I will most certainly update if I get any changes. As of right now there has been NONE so I do not recommend these products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been takeing it for a little over a month and I can see some increas in size. I will be geting more when I start to run out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know there was a cream that went with it.....I haven&#x27;t seen any change</li>
    <li> It didnot work for me ;( I guess as much an my hair was dropping a lot so I got some bad effect</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I love this product! I was once a 38DD but only because I was over weight, once I lost it all I came down to a 32C. They weren&#x27;t too bad but my breasts were left saggy and deflated. Tired with the self-esteem issues and not being able to find a properly fitting bra I started looking around online for ways to naturally grow my breasts. I would never get fake boobs I don&#x27;t have the money and I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe. That and they would just be two lies on my chest. Finally I found Natureday, I orderd as soon as I could. After just a week I had gained half an inch, after about 3 weeks I was in a 32D. I take 3 pills a day, one dropper of liquid and I use the cream at night. My breasts are fuller and bigger, you could say I have quite a bounce in my step now. In another week or so I should be up to a 32DD. I am very happy with the results and I would recommend anyone and everyone that wants bigger breasts. If you can do it naturally you should. It&#x27;s safer, cheaper and real. Thank you Natureday.&amp;lt; 3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Natureday soap and now the pills. I&#x27;ve been very slow to grow purposefully to not draw attention. I&#x27;ve gone from flat chest 42\\&quot; to 43.5\\&quot; around the breasts and they are gaining sensitivity.  I&#x27;m a man and have wanted what I have since my teens. Natureday&#x27;s products work and they work the way you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little sad the pills didn&#x27;t work as the reviews were saying.&lt;br /&gt;I quit drinking caffeine and every other unhealthy thing in my diet to help the pills work better and nothing happened.. it&#x27;s now been 3 weeks and I have not felt or seen any change. I&#x27;m going to give this product 1 more try by buying the cream if not I&#x27;m going to have to put it two :-( faces down..</li>
    <li> It works, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily makes breasts larger than your DNA but it restores its volume and the size which you had in your 20s or before pregnancy. It&#x27;s wonderful and makes breasts young again.</li>
    <li> I bought these about a year before I got pregnant. I used them with some cream and soap as well as drops. I went from an AA (or a small A) to a B cup. But... apparently it made me lactate. Freaked me out and I stopped taking them and stopped lactating. It was worth it in my opinion, but my bf didn&#x27;t like it at the time so I stopped taking them. lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for 6 months and am having great results!&lt;br /&gt;Note that it works differently for each person. It took about 4 month to see a size difference. If you drink caffeine it will slow the process. If you want to continue drinking caffeine take the liquid in the morning an hour before drinking caffeine and before bed! I use the liquid, pills and cream. all twice a day and I have gone from barely filling an \\&quot;a\\&quot; cup to fully filling a \\&quot;b\\&quot; cup. So remember it reacts differently to each person so give it time!&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I have been using these pills for some months now and I&#x27;m now a full 42B bra size and still growing&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;as of the start of february i have been taking 12 pueraria mirifica transgender estrogen pills and i&#x27;m now fitting a 42C cup bra and have quite large nipples (bonus) also my bum have gone bigger and hips slightly wider...so happy now and will continue taking these pills also the pueraria breast enhancement cream...excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;i will up date in a couple months.</li>
    <li> As a male using this product I can say it is indeed a good product - in just one month my chest has really gained a lot of tissue and growth - it may not be that obvious on the outside, but i definitely feel a lot more substance underneath the skin - amazing product, and provided one is eating healthy, it really does work...</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife and it has been a week. She has noticed tingling and soreness, but also a small amount of firming after just one week. I will update this review in a few more weeks. She is also using the cream by thi company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of second week, and there is a visual difference. They are firmer and perkier, this stuff is working great!!</li>
    <li> not happy with this purchase... didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  still flat as ever.  oh well, I guess there are worse problems to have.</li>
    <li> complete waste of money. Bough it along with their drops and cream, followed the instructions for 2+ months... Ask the doctors, ladies- there is unfortunately no magic... what&#x27;s given by nature can&#x27;t be changed unless you do the surgery... :( Look at their website too - where are all those 2000+ testimonials, pictures of real people?....</li>
    <li> i read the views they are pretty good i really would like to try this product but i dnt have the money but i wilk try and get them</li>
    <li> I have been trying to decide for a couple weeks if I should get these because I&#x27;ve tried other products that didn&#x27;t work. But after reading hundreds of reviews I made the plunge and got these and the liquid drops to take together. They arrived today (A DAY EARLY) which really made my day. I will get my current measurements and start taking them both tomorrow... I&#x27;ll update my review when/if any progress is made! :-)</li>
    <li> Since first week of May until today 15/6/2012 no effective no size changes and I also double up with liquid according the instuctin given. No differences at all.</li>
    <li> Followed instructions COMPLETELY. Changed my diet(ate healthy, no caffeine, no alcohol, protein shakes, flax oil, vitamins, etc.)bought drops, soap, and lotion too. Used it for two months before I could no longer use it. I had to stop because I got severe acne, severe cramps, and 2 periods per month from these!!!</li>
    <li> I have recently finished taking the Natureday fulfillment pills and have increased my breast size by approximately 1/2 inch.  The label recommends 3 pills per day taken one time per day.  To take the herbs found in this product would involve taking blessed thistle 2pills x three time per day, and 3 wild yam pills twice a day, two Dong Quai pills twice a day, one saw palmetto three times a day...I think you get the idea.  As you can guess the proprietary blend in Natureday pill for pill is a better value.  It is so much easier to take three pills once a day rather than all those costly herbs several times a day.  The pill work internally to promote the growth of breast tissue.  I found this product easy to take and it seems to work very well.  I recommend Natureday fulfillment pills. The only negative is the pills a bit large so drink water when taking them and they will slide down no problem</li>
    <li> I took this product along with another that was suggested to go good with it, after just 9days I had tenderness in my breast but no larger results.&lt;br /&gt;I kept taking both products as instructed but still I have no larger results.</li>
    <li> This product caused me to start having hot flashes when I stopped taking it.</li>
    <li> This is the same review i have left for pueraria mirifica and nature incs breast cream as i have been combing them all but I am a skeptic when it comes to these types of things but considering i&#x27;ve been flat as a board my entire life due to an underactive thyroid and i mean flat, this is no exaggeration and after 2-3 weeks(since valentines day) of using pueraria mirifica and natureinc&#x27;s breast enhancement pills and cream im actually starting to have some form of shape in that area and some obvious growth and fullness i guess you could call it. i will continue to use these products for a few months,&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because i&#x27;m not 100% sure whether it is the pueraria mirifica doing the magic or natureincs pills or cream or the combination of all three but fingers crossed i keep growing!&lt;br /&gt;The only downside i see with these pills is that i seem to always smell herby,(like the pills) and it isn&#x27;t the cream because the cream and pills smell completley different, but just thought i should add if it feels like your starting to smell like the pills, invest in a strong deoderant and perfume lol</li>
    <li> They taist like crap but they do work. They made my breast fuller for about 4 months, not sure but i think they are starting to go back to there original size.</li>
    <li> they do not work not even a little I do not understand why we do this to ourselves... don&#x27;t waste your money on any of this crap.</li>
    <li> but I would not order it again the other stuff is better&lt;br /&gt;and does the job you asked for&lt;br /&gt;so no I wouldn&#x27;t order it again</li>
    <li> These pills did not work at all.  I had to end up getting real breast implants.  I would not recommend any breast pills as they are a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It will be a month next week I&#x27;ve been taking the pills, liquid and cream. My breasts have filled out more and feel firmer, and plumper! I&#x27;m so happy, it&#x27;s so much fun! If you want instant results, then pay thousands of dollars for surgery and hope they come out okay. This way, although it takes longer, it&#x27;s safe, gradual and natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the rate of growth I have, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll have a D cup (I&#x27;m a C), by the time I finish the second bottle of pills or sooner (1 month and a week from now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend checking out NatureDay.com and reading up on how to use the products, what&#x27;s in them, why it&#x27;s so inexpensive compared to other products on the market, what to expect, how long the products will last, etc. Although everything comes with instructions, I still changed how I was using the stuff once I read online I could use more to speed up results (NOT THE PILLS!), but of course, you will run out a lot faster so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: Every BODY is DIFFERENT! So although I could feel the tissue reacting under my skin within the first few day, it may take someone else longer/ shorter, esp if they are not using the liquid and cream with this.</li>
    <li> The product never reached the destination so far. Payment verified. Very dissappointed.Please explain and update about the present situation. Await for a quick response.</li>
    <li> I waited 30 days before writing a review for this product so I would have progress to share. This actually really works. I read all the reviews good and bad I also went on nature day&#x27;s site and read the reviews and viewed the pictures, to make a long story short, I did my research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I paired these pills with the breast enhancement cream. Its a gradual growth, it doesnt happen immediately and you have to be dedicated to applying the cream(1-3 times a day) and taking 3 pills everyday. My breasts were not full, and were starting to sag after i lost weight and i wanted something to help regain perkiness and fullness in my breasts. This product works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has only been a month and my breasts are much fuller and more firm. Also, the bottom portion of my breasts has filled out more so my nipples are moving up and are much more perky. I just ordered another bottle and some of the liquid extract to enhance the progress and to hopefully speed it up. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> WELL I ORDER IT FOR MMY MOM SHE  IS 70 YEARS OLD SHE  WAS GETTING  A LITTLE SAGGIE IN HER BREAST AND  SHE WASNT HAPPY ABOUT IT SO SHE WANTED ME TO LOOK ON LINE AND FINE SOME BREAST PILLS  BREAST INHASMENT PILLS I MEAN SHE  HAS TRY THEM FOR THREE MONTH  SHE  CALL ME AND TOLD ME  SHE HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS HERE BREAST IS FULLER SHE USE THE CREAM SOAP AND THE PILL THE PILLS AND CREAMS ARE BY NATUREDAY I HOPE IM SPELLING THAT RIGHT SHES HAPPY  SHE SAID HER BREAST WAS TENDER AT FIRST LIKE A TEENAGER GROWING BREAST IT LAST MAYBE A WEEK ARE TWO  BUT SHE STUCK WITH IT  AND THE SOARNESS STOP SHE  HAD FULLER  BOUNCEY BREAST  NOW HER BREAST WAS NICE SIZE  ANY WAY  IT WAS  JUST ALITTLT SAGGIE AT FIRST  NOWW FULLER AND  ROUNDER</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking nature day liquid and pills and I have grown soooooo much . I&#x27;ve been taking them since feb. 3 and I&#x27;ve grown 2 inches . It is a process but I would rather do it the natural way than go under the knife .I only gave this product 4 stars because the pills kind of make me a little nauseous but other than that I would recommend this product for anyone looking for bigger breast.</li>
    <li> Forget it. It doesn&#x27;t work. At least I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have decided that these herbal supplements do not work very well, if at all!</li>

I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
