      <li>This product is fine but think the powder holds better.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this really ended up being more of a VERY strong hair spray.</li>
      <li>have fine hair and this product gives me the body I need.</li>
      <li>Works well with my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It is Nothing more than super hold hairspray.</li>
      <li>Works great for teasing, especially thinner baby hair like mine.</li>
      <li>Great product for big hair.</li>
      <li>would still recommend it, though, because it&#x27;s better for your hair than teasing, and much faster!</li>
      <li>I love most of the Big Sexy Hair product line, and this product didn&#x27;t disappoint either.</li>
      <li>Tried to clean (fix) and it did not work.</li>
      <li>I love the volume that backcombing creates but my hair is fine and long and will look good at first</li>
      <li>As expected, a great product.</li>
      <li>Gives good texture for a big tease!</li>
      <li>and you are good for several hours.</li>
      <li>And every time after i spray some in, i am left with the most stunning hair ever...</li>
      <li>If you tease your hair as much as I do and need a strong hold this is the product for you.</li>
      <li>I think that this works really well for holding fine hair after teasing.</li>
      <li>So handy when styling my short hair.</li>
      <li>This product is great for special occasion poofs, but definitely not recommended for daily use.</li>
      <li>this is my first bigsexyhair product i ever got,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a hair product snob and there is simply nothing better than this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this with many different styles.</li>
      <li>well love that you recived four smaller travel bottles.</li>
      <li>It is like freeze spray, which is okay, but it leaves a white film on hair.</li>
      <li>I go ahead and spray my hair with hairspray first and then tease and then spray this stuff on there.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what I need it to do.  </li>
      <li>And at a better price here than in my local stores.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this product I did not have this problem.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest at least rinsing your hair before sleeping with this product in; a quick wash to really remove the product is better.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair cut very short.</li>
      <li>If you want that big hair look or if you are like me and need the extra body at the roots for fine hair this works fantastic.  </li>
      <li>May not be suitable for dark hair.</li>
      <li>This really does work like a tease</li>
      <li>and it went straight to the trash.</li>
      <li>It really works to hold a style, and it gives your hair a &amp;#34;teased&amp;#34; style, if you spray a lot in one spot.</li>
      <li>this product is VERY sticky.</li>
      <li>Really holds my hair and gets it to stand up.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not the type of girl to shampoo your hair twice, you must after this product.bits very sticky.</li>
      <li>This product really is amazing and does exactly what it claims to do, even with a very small spritz of product.</li>
      <li>sometimes i spray on a little more after i&#x27;m done teasing.</li>
      <li>that lasts for all of about 5 minutes before it deflates and does nothing more than leave me with stiff hair sprayed hair.</li>
      <li>This can get sticky if sprayed too much in one spot, but overall, if I want a style to hold the whole day, this is the spray I reach for.</li>
      <li>Other than that I really like it!!!</li>
      <li>I love this spray, I prefer it over the powder that I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>So disappointed that the perfect look it gives me is gone in a matter of minutes.</li>
      <li>I have thin hair and this gives amazing body and height.</li>
      <li>It does comb out the next day if using at the roots but very stiff, better to just wash it out as it might break the hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves white residue and may look messy if you don&#x27;t figure out how to smooth it out after spaying.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Holds great.  Can get a bit gummy if overused.  Also, the spray dispenser get gummed up.  If you want your hair to stay put, try this very firm hold spray.</li>
    <li> Works great on my fine hair!</li>
    <li> The product is good but the spay doesn&#x27;t work. I can&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> Love It! Works like a charm. Gives a great lift to your hair..</li>
    <li> I bought this to create a excellent look for my Zombie inmate hair at Halloween!  It was so much fun and a big mess!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It does exactly what I need it to do.  My problem is that the spray nozzle clogs very easily.  Even if I clean it under hot water after every use, it is still impossible to get the product to come out of the can.  I purchased two and used half one can and when I couldnt get the spray to work, I went to the other can.  I cant get that one to work at all.  It is very frustrating to have your hair exactly as you want it and the spray can wont work.  They have to work on that problem.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff! So handy when styling my short hair. Just have to spray on my semi dry hair and style. No blowdrying, just style and go!</li>
    <li> BIG FAN OF THIS HAIRSPRAY!!!!</li>
    <li> i recently went from very long hair to very short and i was looking for good products i could use to style my hair. this what a tease works sooo amazing. i don&#x27;t even have to tease it with the comb just spray it in and it last a long time to.</li>
    <li> This product is not meant to be used as a hairspray! The proper way to use it is to spray a section of hair and then separate that section, the spray creates tiny hook type formations that give the teased look.  DONT BACKCOMB OVER THE SPRAY!</li>
    <li> I think that this works really well for holding fine hair after teasing. I love the volume that backcombing creates but my hair is fine and long and will look good at first but then the backcomb like falls out and leaves a ratty mess. So after playing around with this stuff a few times I have got it to hold pretty well. I go ahead and spray my hair with hairspray first and then tease and then spray this stuff on there. It has serious hold!!!! The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is so sticky and hard to comb through, but I guess if you are wanting hold that&#x27;s a good thing. You just have to be careful not to spray to much. Other than that I really like it!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  Really holds my hair and gets it to stand up.  No other product comes close to the amount of hold and strength.  I will be using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I read about this spray somewhere on line.  It does what it says, but be sure you don&#x27;t want to comb it out any time soon after you use it.</li>
    <li> Great product for big hair.</li>
    <li> As expected, a great product.</li>
    <li> Product leaves hair hard and sticky. Cannot brush it out without ripping the hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave any  volume just a hot mess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this with many different styles. And every time after i spray some in, i am left with the most stunning hair ever... Gorgeous volume and lovely bounce. Almost seems unreal how beautiful it makes my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that lasts for all of about 5 minutes before it deflates and does nothing more than leave me with stiff hair sprayed hair. I thought maybe adding some Spray and Play by the same brand would help keep the volume and bounce but it doesn&#x27;t. Even if i dont touch my hair at all, the effect of this stuff will not last. Not sure what I am missing. So disappointed that the perfect look it gives me is gone in a matter of minutes.</li>
    <li> this is my first bigsexyhair product i ever got, yes, it did gave me some volume and it holds the tease. But after a while it made some of my hair stick together and it went really stiff.....</li>
    <li> So disappointed!! I saw that other reviewers said it smelled terrible. I really thought it couldn&#x27;t be that bad. I sprayed it once and it went straight to the trash. It is not a smell you want anywhere on you!</li>
    <li> perfect, cost is good, seller prompt and packing appropriate.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this really ended up being more of a VERY strong hair spray. I use it, but not for teasing my hair...it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Gives good texture for a big tease! Lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Feels like I sprayed a thin layer of lacquer on my hair.  It left the strands feeling hard &amp; glued.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this completely alleviates the need to back tease, but it does cut it down.  My hair is fairly long and teasing just doesn&#x27;t do it--my hair is too heavy.  But this product, plus minimal teasing is just what I needed!</li>
    <li> product kept leaking and top came off</li>
    <li> My hair does so well with this product and it has become increasingly harder to find.  I purchased it here and bought in multiples!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife and her hair stylist love it</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gives you great volume without the damage teasing gives you. There is nothing better than this product.</li>
    <li> This product really is amazing and does exactly what it claims to do, even with a very small spritz of product. It is VERY long lasting, which is good and bad - good for maintaining your hairstyle, but difficult to comb/brush through the following morning, particularly with bedtime tangles in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest at least rinsing your hair before sleeping with this product in; a quick wash to really remove the product is better. Otherwise, expect a lot of tugging, pulling and maybe even some tears of pain trying to break through it come morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend it, though, because it&#x27;s better for your hair than teasing, and much faster!</li>
    <li> The nozzle clogs up every time it is used so when you go to spray it, you get globs of white stuff in your hair that looks like snow. The first time I used this product I did not have this problem.</li>
    <li> If you have trouble getting your hair to hold poof even after extensive teasing, this product is for you. I have very thick hair, and even with lots of layers, poof does not last for more than 10-15 min. I slightly tease my hair, spray a little bit of the &#x27;backcomb in a bottle&#x27; at the base of the hair where i just teased, then keep teasing. sometimes i spray on a little more after i&#x27;m done teasing. don&#x27;t spray before you tease at all, otherwise it&#x27;ll be too stiff for you to tease. this product is VERY sticky. it is a pain to get out of your hair; took me 3 shampoos/conditions to get it out. And it doesn&#x27;t smell that great. but it works! save a little bit of unteased hair to lay over the poof, otherwise it will look like a big mess. it is too strong/sticky to comb over and make it look neat after its all said and done. your hair will not be flexible after application of this product, it will be sticky and stiff. It makes your hair feel pretty nasty too. This product is great for special occasion poofs, but definitely not recommended for daily use. It would probably ruin your hair if u put it through that every day.</li>
    <li> Works great for teasing, especially thinner baby hair like mine. It IS hard to brush completely out or wash the next day. If you&#x27;re not the type of girl to shampoo your hair twice, you must after this product.bits very sticky.</li>
    <li> It is like freeze spray, which is okay, but it leaves a white film on hair.</li>
    <li> Works well with my fine hair.  Just need a little squirt and you are good for several hours.</li>
    <li> I love this spray, I prefer it over the powder that I have used in the past. It keeps hold very well and it works great. I need to find this in a bigger bottle since I use it every day. If you tease your hair as much as I do and need a strong hold this is the product for you. My hair is very thick also and this is one of the only things that keeps hold all day.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well! Love and will buy again!</li>
    <li> After a few uses the sprayer got clogged.  Tried to clean (fix) and it did not work.</li>
    <li> love this stuff... no damage and great hold.</li>
    <li> This product is fine but think the powder holds better. I can&#x27;t believe how well it keeps one hair style in place.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! If used correctly it gives the look of teasing your hair. I have fine hair cut very short. When I use this it gives me lift and the appearance of volume.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! If you want that big hair look or if you are like me and need the extra body at the roots for fine hair this works fantastic.  It does comb out the next day if using at the roots but very stiff, better to just wash it out as it might break the hair. I do not use everyday just when I do not want my hair to go flat.</li>
    <li> Surely helps my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I love this! Carry it with me always!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I have really flat, think hair and I use it on my roots and it gives it great body! This is not a hairspray, so don&#x27;t use it like that, its too thick!</li>
    <li> I use it almost every day. It leaves white residue and may look messy if you don&#x27;t figure out how to smooth it out after spaying. May not be suitable for dark hair.</li>
    <li> This hairspray works great! It really works to hold a style, and it gives your hair a &amp;#34;teased&amp;#34; style, if you spray a lot in one spot. This can get sticky if sprayed too much in one spot, but overall, if I want a style to hold the whole day, this is the spray I reach for. Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have thin short hair and this product gives me the fullness that I what without damaging my hair as actual teasing does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair product snob and there is simply nothing better than this product. I have thin hair and this gives amazing body and height. I wanted a pin up style for my wedding and brought it with me to the stylist and even she was amazed and said she needed to get it in the salon.</li>
    <li> This makes my thin flat scant hair look like much more!  I bend down so my hair falls &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; and spray a little; when I lift my head back up, I have a lot of body.  After a few uses you&#x27;ll have to pick off the product that gums up the spray hole or it&#x27;ll just sputter instead of spray.</li>
    <li> After reading great reviews, I purchased this. I am not impressed. It is Nothing more than super hold hairspray. Left my hair VERY hard and crunchy.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it is a bit too pricey for me.  Will purchase a couple bottles at a time if I find a bargain on ebay.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this hair spray to anyone who&#x27;s wanting a effect of teased hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many product to get this effect and this is the ONLY one that works and will last all day or night.</li>
    <li> gives volume and body! awesome product!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Works well love that you recived four smaller travel bottles. I use this all the time when doing my hair</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s hairspray like product and it doesn&#x27;t really smell great to begin with but it&#x27;s like they didn&#x27;t even try. It smells like chemicals used at a mechanic shop so... that&#x27;s kind of a bummer. I love BSH line though and it does work so I usually just spritz a little dry shampoo over it to mask the smell.</li>
    <li> I love most of the Big Sexy Hair product line, and this product didn&#x27;t disappoint either. One of the best teasing sprays I&#x27;ve found. And at a better price here than in my local stores. It enhances teasing without being too stiff and sticky. Hair can still be easily brushed down and tamed if teased wildly, as I tend to start out with. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel heavy from the extra product, and my scalp isn&#x27;t itchy. My only complaint/recommendation is that you scrape off the dried product from the nozzle before each use. It will keep it from spraying out in weird directions or bubbling out because the nozzle is crusted over.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m crazy obsessed over this product! It&#x27;s amazing how well it works! No need to back comb your hair at all...just spray where you would tease and it does it for you! So much less damage to your hair. I will never let myself run out of this!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! My hair is so fine and has no body! Even ratting it doesn&#x27;t work so this help give me the volume. And the price is amazing!!! Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product but not everyone will...&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and this product gives me the body I need.</li>
    <li> You gotta have this stuff.  It gives me the texture and hold I need for critical places in my style.  I use it all the time</li>
    <li> This really does work like a tease</li>
