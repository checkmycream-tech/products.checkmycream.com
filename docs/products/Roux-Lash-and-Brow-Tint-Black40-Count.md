      <li>Color is good, though.</li>
      <li>while once you dye the brows it can look good, it is too cumbersome.  </li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>, I LOVED how my eyelashes looked.  </li>
      <li>You have to do it a couple of times to get a good result.</li>
      <li>I had no problems with this product and was very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the appearance</li>
      <li>Easy to use at home, but not as beautiful affect as it was made at the salon.</li>
      <li>But anything&#x27;s better than blond!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to not have to pencil in my eyebrows every day like I had been doing most of my life!</li>
      <li>The tint works real well and looks great!!  </li>
      <li>So you make your own q-tip and apply the two solutions with that.</li>

      <li>Very happy with the new package.  </li>
      <li>With a magnifying mirror it is very easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I used disposable mascara applicators and a magnifying mirror, and it was very easy.</li>
      <li>I was going to a spa to have this done, now it&#x27;s easy at home!</li>
      <li>If you have normalto full fair lashes and use a lash curler you will see a difference.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use (I don&#x27;t use the enclosed paper pads or wood picks because smearing petroleum jelly is more effective).  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay</li>
      <li>I love getting my brows and lashes tinted, but no salons close to home.  </li>
      <li>I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay</li>

      <li>Apply petroleum jelly to the top lids (where tips of lashes touch brow bone)&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
      <li>This product has given me more confidence in my appearance without makeup.  </li>

      <li>It dyed my skin better than it did my eyebrow hairs.  </li>
      <li>I thought it would tint more than it does.</li>
      <li>I apply it like I would mascara in a way twisting the q-tip around to get the top and the bottom of each lash.  </li>
      <li>DO MANY BROWS.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;only used it onces but will try it again to see if I have better luck</li>
      <li>I tried the dental brushes they were ok</li>
      <li>The best thing in the end was the picks that came with the kit and a tiny bit of a cotton ball thread on it.</li>
      <li>But most of the time you won&#x27;t need to bother with mascara; that&#x27;s just if you happen to want</li>
      <li>:)    TM.</li>
      <li>the box says that&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t try to be thrifty and not use too many</li>
      <li>Product did not tint my lashes, but surely stained my skin....  </li>
      <li>and I saw even better results.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for probably about 30 years or even more.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>It feels better going on</li>
      <li>Which for me was okay, because I got more than my money out of it.</li>
      <li>More of the product stayed on my fingers rather than her lashes, the fumes were burning her eyes and on the box, it says if you get the color on the skin, use the stain remover immediately, so I did.</li>
      <li>Hopefully can reuse many times after opening.</li>
      <li>THEIR WERE MANY PACKETS.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I find that for my purposes this give me more control.</li>
      <li>You should go to a GOOD salon and get your lashes tinted there first to see if this is something you would like to keep on doing going forward.  </li>
      <li>This product is fairly easy to use and it lasts about a month or more.  </li>
      <li>You have to buy your own or do what they suggest and MAKE your own with the provided wooden sticks and your own provided cotton</li>
      <li>so easy to use.</li>
      <li>2 easy steps...</li>
      <li>and it came to her very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and at your convenience.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I suggest using a clean mascara wand to apply it, works a lot better than what they tell you to use.</li>
      <li>easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>All the ingredients come in blister-pack plastic trays with foil over, and the foil does not come off easily.  </li>
      <li>This product is easy to use, even for a beginner.  </li>
      <li>After 3 weeks, my tint is still going strong.  </li>
      <li>It works fine, but stings like hell if you get it in your eye.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-Might be fine for some people, or if you have a friend who can help you apply the product</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping would recommend to anyone!!</li>
      <li>I should have cut the paper to fit rightt under my lashes.</li>
      <li>A light hand , as you can do it over.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for about 2 years now and think it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This gives great color to my otherwise strawberry blond lashes, enough that even my fiance notices when I&#x27;ve used it!  </li>
      <li>tint worked great, but only after I went and got disposable mascara wands.</li>
      <li>But it did a fantastic job on my eyelashes--</li>
      <li>But a lot cheaper, and that&#x27;s important.</li>
      <li>the end result is not as good as when i get my eye lashes tinted professionally.</li>
      <li>Instructions are very easy, no harsh chemical smells at all, very quick, and the results are actually better than the salon, I think.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>I think that most women, having so much experience applying cosmetics, are pretty adept at fiddling with things around their eyes</li>
      <li>and I was so nervous that I would look like Groucho Marx that the first time I did it very lightly.</li>
      <li>It is quick and easy.</li>
      <li>It is important for you to know that application is cumbersome and some of you will not be successful or patient enough to figure it out and the product is a dye thus it will stain that is its job.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tried this product via the instructions included three times.  Product did not tint my lashes, but surely stained my skin....  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times, it always ends up staining my skin no matter how careful I am about applying the dye. The remover is somewhat helpful in removing the coloring from skin but it is extremely harsh.   It does do a decent job coloring your eyebrows but it leaves the skin underneath quite dark.</li>
    <li> I found this hard to use.  It dyed my skin better than it did my eyebrow hairs.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I still have a few gray eyebrow hairs I can&#x27;t get to color, but this is still a very good product and I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past few months and have gotten a lot better at application.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the appearance -- it&#x27;s so odd to have eyebrows after years of the invisible blonde hairs!    I must express some concern, however, about the ingredients.  I was so excited to make eyebrows that I didn&#x27;t really read the entire package insert.  Today I saw that one of the tinting solutions contains sodium laurel sulfate.  This is NOT good.  Sodium laurel sulfate (SLS) is a common ingredient in many beauty products, soaps, and even a few foods.  The evidence is mounting that it should be avoided.  Among other things, SLS denatures proteins AND inhibits hair follicles.  In other words, it breaks down your hairs, can damage sensitive or fragile skin, and it may stop new hairs from appearing.  It is essential that you keep this product off your skin!    I&#x27;ll have to do some searching to find out what the average turnover times for eyebrow and lashes are.  If the lifespan of an eyebrow hair or an eyelash is several months, longterm use may damage what little hair and lashed I have.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll also contact Roux and express my concerns.  Companies are beginning to respond to comsumer concerns about SLS, so it is worth a try.  I would hate to have to give up my new eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I have done eyelash tinting both at home and at a salon.  After my last experience with the salon I think I will stick to at home only.  While the salon tint does last a little longer, it really does sting my eyes to the point I worry about if I will do damage it I keep having it done.  Roux tint does not sting my eyes at all even if any solution gets in my eye by accident.  It feels better going on and I have no red eyes after I am done like at the salon.  This formula last approximately 4 weeks on my lashes.  I have very long lashes that go light at the ends.  Mascara bothers my eyes so I prefer to go without whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lash tint is relatively easy to use if you have steady hands. Even with steady hands *use latex/plastic gloves while applying any of the solution*  I do not even bother with the Vaseline on the under eye and lid.  That part is a real pain in the neck to do and the pads never stick.  I have a very steady hand and I use regular q-tips.  I twist the q-tips to make sure they are very tight and then apply the first liquid.  I let that dry as suggested.  Next is the part that was a trial and error but it really works... dip one end of the q-tip into the No 2 solution and the other end into the stain eraser.  I apply it like I would mascara in a way twisting the q-tip around to get the top and the bottom of each lash.  If I get any of the No 2 solution on my skin I immediately can flip the q-tip over and get rid of the stain.  Works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the bottles for about 6 months and the No 1 solution is starting to turn color so I will buy a new one before I do this again.  So I wouldn&#x27;t get 40 real uses out of it due to that alone, but at about $30 for a set, it&#x27;s what I pay for one tint at the salon.  I will take $5/month over $30 any day.  If I wanted I could do it every 2 weeks to keep it really fresh, but I can usually stretch it to 4.</li>
    <li> I have strawberry blonde hair with blonde eyebrows.  Went to the salon a few times to dye my eyebrows but had to go back frequently to maintain the color.  The Roux tint last a long, long time even when using on a regular basis (every couple of weeks).  Much cheaper than the salon.  BEWARE!!!  The first couple of times using the tint is a little dramatic...follow the instructions carefully.  Once you get the hang of it the results are not so shocking and both brows can be done in five minutes.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit in black. I got this to use on my eyelashes which are medium brown, but a little bit after half way up to the tips they are blonde, same thing on my bottom lashes. I did not find the kit messy whatsoever. I followed the directions for use and I did it twice to make the lashes darker. There was a difference in my lashes but I wasn&#x27;t really super pleased until I woke up the next day and the black lashes made my eyes stand out and have a look of lightly applied mascara. I definitely will continue using this product. I have very sensitive skin and got some of the product on my lower eyelid and even though I took it off when I realized, it burned my skin and left it irritated for two days. I should have cut the paper to fit rightt under my lashes. if you get vaseline/lotion on the lashes they wont take the color. I had no problem with stains. If anyone has tips on mixing the product or how soon to put on the tint and how long to leave it on to make the lashes take the color better I would appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I paid a lot of money for this at Sallys.  I am a former cosmetologist and I know my way around hair color.  This product is absolutely WORTHLESS.  I followed the directions precisely (I am an IT professional now and I can follow directions).  There was absolutely ZERO color on my lashes when done.  There was black splotches on the eyelash guards but no difference whatsoever in the lashes.  I did one eye only as a test and there was no difference.  I repeated it a SECOND time (double checking directions) and again NOTHING.  I am disappointed. I can&#x27;t return it, I feel like Roux just robbed me $36 bucks.</li>
    <li> I chose the black color wishing that it would darken my eyebrow color which is already light black. I was wrong.  I saw no change at all. Zero. Big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Totally works. However, I leave it on for about 30 minutes and apply it with a mascara wand. For me, it fades in about a week and needs to reapplied every two weeks.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my brows because it would be too dark, (I stick to auburn hair color applied with a small paint brush for my brows), but for my lashes this product is fantastic!  You definitely have to get used to using it.  It will burn and dye the skin around your eyes if you aren&#x27;t careful!  Once I got used to applying, though, I no longer needed to worry about the vaseline.  This gives great color to my otherwise strawberry blond lashes, enough that even my fiance notices when I&#x27;ve used it!  The professional I used to go to always burned my eyes.  I appreciate having control over the procedure now (no more burning!), and being able to do it on my own schedule, and for a fraction of the cost.  If you have a steady hand and trust yourself to be careful, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The first tint I ever used for my brows was Godefroy. After about 3 applications I think I became allergic because I kept getting red behind the brows on the skin and the dye stopped \\&quot;taking.\\&quot; I&#x27;d try several times and when I wiped it off my eyebrows were as blond as ever. Today I stopped by Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and picked up the Roux brown. What a difference! It \\&quot;took\\&quot; *VERY* quickly on the first try. I used q-tips instead of trying to wrap loose cotton around the supplied toothpicks. The Roux (40-application box) consists of two liquids plus a stain remover. I put the first liquid on (which is clear), waited for it to dry, then when I applied the second liquid (the actual tint), the color of my brows started changing AS I applied it. I had to wipe off the first brow before even starting the second brow, it was tinting that fast. My skin underneath the brow did get a little tinted too, but it looks almost like I brushed some brow powder in. I know that part will wash away after a couple days and I might have to touch them up with brow powder. Or apply the tint again. But anything&#x27;s better than blond! Roux appears to be popular in salons too from what I&#x27;ve read, so I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t develop an allergy to this too, where it stops working.     Anyway, just wanted to follow up and let others know that the Godefroy eventually stopped working and that I found a great replacement. Roux probably isn&#x27;t the best choice for first-timers, but it&#x27;s easier than mixing powders/liquids together like the Godefroy, and I hear the one-time Roux applications are a pain because the blister packs are difficult to open, so I went straight for the 40-application supply. Considering how little is needed, I imagine I&#x27;ll probably get more than 40 applications. :)    TM.</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend.  She asked for it by name.  She swears by it. I didn&#x27;t have to mail anything and it came to her very quickly.  The black is evidently preferable to the brown. Just great.</li>
    <li> Summary of Roux Lash Tint: much better than mascara or paying too much at a salon, works well enough, but if there is a better alternative I will go with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $60 at a boutique salon to have my lashes tinted, and while I didn&#x27;t much care for the experience (even though I kept my eyes closed, apparently they fluttered as they stayed closed, and some of the dye ran into my eyes and made me tear up excessively, so some of the dye ran down a bit with the tears - cleaned up ok, but the dye stung my eyes a bit), I LOVED how my eyelashes looked.  Like mascara, but natural (ok, maybe the wrong word, but they looked natural!) even the little blonde tips.  I recently found out that you can buy lash tints online (and while FDA has a warning against home lash tinting with certain ingredients, neither Roux nor 1000 Hours have those ingredients, from my research), so I&#x27;m doing an experiment, side by side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have found - I think Roux is the kind of lash tint the salon used.  It cost me about $5 (including shipping) on eBay for a single application (I recommend trying it that way).  Nice little mark-up for the salon, even accounting for labor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The draw-backs of the Roux lash tint experiment:&lt;br /&gt;1)  All the ingredients come in blister-pack plastic trays with foil over, and the foil does not come off easily.  I had to pierce some of the chemicals with a safety pin to open it, and even then had trouble dipping the wands into the chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;2) The second dye (I guess the first dye preps the hair, the second turns it coal black) turned my fingertips black. The instructions said to use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) anywhere you don&#x27;t want turning black, and I faithfully ringed my eyes below and to the eyebrow, but never thought of putting it on my fingertips!  :)  Now I look like some kind of medieval scholar.  Oh well, it&#x27;ll fade.&lt;br /&gt;3) Because I was doing a self-tint, I had to do one eye at a time.  I found that the first dye stung my eyes (again) but I just kept a folded-up piece of toilet paper below my eyelashes.  The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second.  That tells me there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;4) My lower lashes aren&#x27;t really dyed at all.  I went back over them at the end, but they just didn&#x27;t dye.  I think maybe there was petroleum jelly on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... that is my review of Roux.  I will be glad to provide an update about 1000Hour lash tint once it comes in from eBay (btw, that one is about $1 per application, but you have to buy a whole box).  I have heard from other feedback that with 1000Hour you don&#x27;t need to keep your eyes shut the whole time, it doesn&#x27;t sting the same, and the application wand is much easier (like a mascara wand).  But I will have to see for myself.ded-up piece of toilet paper below my eyelashes.  The eye I did first is not nearly as black or luscious as the one I did second.

    <li> I THOUGH I WAS PURCHASING INDIVIDUAL PACKETS.  THIS PRODUCT IS FOR HAIR SALOONS.THAT DO MANY BROWS.  THE LABEL MISS LEAD ME TO THING THEIR WERE MANY PACKETS.</li>
    <li> I bought this at another store for a higher price (had a gift card). I tried the dental brushes they were ok also tried Q-tips they held way to much liquid so it burned my eyes. The best thing in the end was the picks that came with the kit and a tiny bit of a cotton ball thread on it. This was a disappointment colored my lashes but made me realize how skimpy my lashes are. So the dye works well with what you have . I will use it again just don&#x27;t be shocked at your lashes . Its not the dye its your skimpy lashes it colors what is there. When you curl your lashes you see it more.</li>
    <li> I have medium blonde hair with highlights and lowlights and have been getting my eyebrows tinted at a salon for about 3 or 4 months now to give them some depth. What a difference a little extra color makes! Unfortunately I had to get them done every 3 weeks to keep the color. I decided to try this product as it was way cheaper than the salon of course. Instructions are very easy, no harsh chemical smells at all, very quick, and the results are actually better than the salon, I think. You have control over how light or dark you want them by the length of time you leave it on. 2 steps, done in 5 minutes! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this item because I have dark hair and my eyebrows are very light.  I was considering getting my eyebrows tattooed but I was afraid of the jump.  I decided to buy this item it is great.  It does make my eyebrows look nice and dark.  The only thing I reconmend is that instead of using the little sticks provided in the box use a q-tip instead it will work better on presition of the color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit drippy which means you need to be really careful not to get it on your skin or in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is easy to use and works perfectly. I use the brown on my brows and the black on my lashes. The product information states clearly that this is for professional use, and it is the same product the salon I go to, uses. Beiging thrifty, though, and I saved the cost of the kit with just one home dye job! Perfect!!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews of the Roux Lash and Brow tint on other Amazon pages, I was worried it was going to be more trouble than it was worth. But I found the entire process remarkably easy and it worked well. I only needed it to tint my lashes (they are light on the ends) and didn&#x27;t have any vaseline so I used a cotton swap to apply 1, let it dry for a minute, then used a cotton swap again to apply 2. I closed one eye and applied 2 with the eye paper included to rub the swap against (so it wouldn&#x27;t get on my skin) and then swabbed the bottom lashes. The stain remover doesn&#x27;t really work, so if you have vaseline I would recommend it around the lash area (again, apply with a Q-Tip). The color looks great, I would try black next time for a darker lash but overall A+.</li>
    <li> I would be very careful when using this product. I purchased a single pack and read all the instructions. Did the preparation, vaseline and eye protection pads and no.1 solution etc. I gently peeled off the foil to the no.2 solution (dye) and WHOOSH, suddenly about 6 of my fingers were covered in black dye. I rushed to the sink with the packet of stain remover, which proved to be absolutely useless!. I tried nail polish remover- nothing. I then tried the hard stuff - Goof off, Goo Be Gone, industrial hand cleaner, and finally mineral spirits. Nothing worked. Even Sally beauty supply couldnt remove the stain.    So as I write, I have 6 black stained fingers and unfortunately wasnt even able to use the remaining solution on my lashes because all that was left was a clear watery solution! It must have seperated or been defective. Anyway, the instructions need to mention that you need to wear gloves or put the vaseline on your fingers also because its practically impossible to remove this dye from skin - thank goodness, it wasnt my face! I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Working on TV a man doesn&#x27;t want to look like we are wearing makeup. With the hot light on you this gives a natural look without all the fuss. I was going to a spa to have this done, now it&#x27;s easy at home!</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this product and was very satisfied. I will admit I have had practice using it when i was in cosmetology school though. As long as you don&#x27;t get it on your skin it should work well.</li>
    <li> I decided to ignore the other reviewers.  Bad idea.  This product is expensive garbage.  It&#x27;s messy and complicated and more importantly, it really doesn&#x27;t work. Using identical process, I wound up with one eye dyed and one eye much less dyed, I looked like Petey the dog.  The only good news is that it all wore off within a few days. SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for probably about 30 years or even more. It is great! I am a natural red head, with very blond eyelashes and brows, which I have never liked.  This product is my saving grace! It is quick and easy. You do have to be careful not to get it in your eyes, but it washes out easily, if you do, and without any side effects.  I agree with one other review, I wish I could buy the stain remover separately, as that seems to be used up way before the actual dye is used.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I received this and all of the bottles were liquid.  (I had used another brand which is a gel and which sticks to the hairs much better.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and, if you don&#x27;t cover everything around the brow with petroleum jelly, the surrounding skin will stain.  there is a stain remover, but it often doesn&#x27;t get all of the stain off of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just did it this afternoon and one brow came out looking good, and the other brow has stains around it, even after using the stain remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they also give you wood sticks to use and tell you to put cotton at the end of them.  haven&#x27;t they heard of q-tips?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this again.  while once you dye the brows it can look good, it is too cumbersome.  its like they haven&#x27;t changed this product since 1950 or something.  they could make it a gel, which would make it much easier to use.  I&#x27;m going to try the Godefrey eyebrow tint, as from reading the reviews, it seems easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:  18 or so hours have passed since I dyed the brows, and my skin is still stained, even after using the stain remover again.  WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I have very sparse eyelashes that are light in color. I have been going to a salon to have them tinted, but could only manage an appointment every couple of months…at that interval, the color had faded and grown out too much. This is the brand that my salon uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this kit, I can do the tinting on myself every couple of weeks. I do NOT recommend that others try my method, but here is what works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Apply petroleum jelly to the top lids (where tips of lashes touch brow bone)&lt;br /&gt;• Apply tint on one eye at a time&lt;br /&gt;• Use Q-tips as applicators&lt;br /&gt;• Dip Q-tip in solution #1 and apply to lashes (I keep my eye open during this process, but I am SUPER careful). Let dry&lt;br /&gt;• Dip Q-tip in solution #2 and apply to lashes (I keep my eye open during this process, but I am SUPER careful). Let dry&lt;br /&gt;• Wash and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that I can use this method because my lashes are very, very thin. I imagine that someone with thick lashes would need to keep the eye that they are working on closed because they would be applying more solution to the lashes.</li>
    <li> Easy to use at home, but not as beautiful affect as it was made at the salon. But a lot cheaper, and that&#x27;s important. I usually reapply every 2-3 weeks and I use it on my lashes, too (only do that if you have sure hands). I apply it with a Q tip, and wipe a little with the Stain remover solution if it looks too dark after being done.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for years through my Beauty Supply store Planet Beauty.  The dye is very dark (black) which is a little scary on the eyebrows but fades to the perfect color within a couple days, it&#x27;s awesome on the eyelashes.  Your product was about half the darkness.  It gets that way as it ages, the potency is reduced.  I&#x27;m wondering if what I received was close to expiring.  It was shipped in a timely manner and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Works perfect. I would tell everyone to get this if you are n esthetician or just want your eye lashes darker.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, but only makes a very subtle difference on blonde lashes. Seems to build up a little over time, so I&#x27;ve even using it once a week to try to get a more noticeable tint.</li>
    <li> It works if you don&#x27;t have time to go to the salon. the end result is not as good as when i get my eye lashes tinted professionally.</li>
    <li> I did not buy it here, but at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and it was like $30+ there.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I didn&#x27;t think it worked at all and was very disappointed i threw that much money away on the teeny tiny bottles  of product you only get too . I gave the rest to the hubby to touch up his beard, but it didn&#x27;t work for him either.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time and money&lt;br /&gt;You are better off if you are just doing your EYEBROWS ONLY to use regular hair dye for $1 from the dollarstore as long as you are careful and use a tiny amount on a finger tip at a time when applying it so you don&#x27;t get it into your eyes by accident. And also you have enough to last a year at least from one package.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and at your convenience.</li>
    <li> The tint works real well and looks great!!  It is easily applied and takes to the brows really well.  I will definitely be using this seller again.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a lash tint- this will not come with a cream color like in the salon. This is a clear liquid solution of silver chemical deposit- and it is very eye irritating. First you apply solution #1, which smells like ammonia and then you apply Solution #2 which smells like bleach and as soon as you get it near your eye- your eyes start to water and blink.  I do not think this is meant for the lower lid but rather to be used with your lids closed- either way, the smell is noxious and overpowering.  Even though both liquids are clear, if you accidentally touch your skin- which you will- a black blob of product appears, which is the silver reacting against your skin.  The directions very clearly say that this is a silver depositing product.  I would not recommend this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even if you are a Prime Member, you will have to pay to return this item to the seller as I learned when I went to return this.</li>
    <li> I got my brows done in a shop, always to dark and funny looking for a white hair old lady.  now I just do a light coloring and it looks now real.</li>
    <li> This product works well, but if you are over 50 or so and have some grey hair, it does not \\&quot;take\\&quot; as well on your lashes and brows and fades within a few days. You have to reapply at least once a week. If you are younger, it lasts for weeks before it fades.</li>
    <li> I am 51 and ordered this product as I have been getting grey hairs in my eyebrows.  I had never tinted my eyebrows before but would highly recommend this product.  It was easy and fast to use.  I used a qtip for the application instead of the sticks that were provided in the kit.  Fyi, I assumed that the #2 bottle would be a black color but it was clear like the #1 bottle.  I guess it is the chemical reaction of the 2 that colors your eyebrows black as soon as it is applied.  I went to Sally&#x27;s and this is the only permanent eyebrow tint that they sold and it was $10 more so I bought it through Amazon.  I have only used it once so far but am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The papers under your eyes are difficult to work with.  I tried doing it myself one eye at a time.  It works fine, but stings like hell if you get it in your eye.  Recommend working with a partner and doing each others.  Color is good, though.</li>
    <li> I thought it would tint more than it does. I apply it with a  lash brush and I&#x27;ve applied it with the applicators either way it didn&#x27;t make it any thicker.  would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have very light eyebrows and light brown hair with blonde highlights... I bought the brown color and I was so nervous that I would look like Groucho Marx that the first time I did it very lightly. 2 easy steps... Step one is a clear liquid you paint on your eyebrows (just the hair) and let dry. Step 2 is the actual dye.. Starts off clear then turns brown within seconds. I read reviews so I knew my eyebrows would turn dark quickly. used  cotton swabs instead of the included toothpicks and it was much more efficient. The result was a very light, natural brown color on my eyebrows!! I was thrilled to not have to pencil in my eyebrows every day like I had been doing most of my life! I ended up doing a second application to get a little darker result. very quick and easy as long as you are careful! :)</li>
    <li> I really like to product. It is easy to use. Black lashes last for a while. Hopefully can reuse many times after opening.</li>
    <li> Sucks save your money product can&#x27;t be returned waste of money !!!!</li>
    <li> I used this on my eyebrows.You have to do it a couple of times to get a good result. A light hand , as you can do it over. I used too much of part 2, in the beginning. It does stain the skin in area, but the product included with the kit ,removes stains. It is going to save me a lot of money, as it costs about $25 each time my brows were done in the salon.It seemed hard to get appointments, when I needed them.I haven&#x27;t tried the lashes yet. I am happy with brow results.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work for me&lt;br /&gt;only used it onces but will try it again to see if I have better luck</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 years now and think it&#x27;s fantastic.  With a magnifying mirror it is very easy to apply.  Does a great job permanently tinting your brows and lashes and it lasts about a month to 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> This dye is easy to use although messy if you are not extremely careful, but does yield great result and color. For what you would pay at the salon or a lot less you can dye your eyelashes and brows 30+ times. I say 30+ even though the package says 40 because I think after it gets so old it doesn&#x27;t work as well. Which for me was okay, because I got more than my money out of it. I think it get old before you can finish it, because your lashes will last 4-6 weeks. Mine last upwards of 6 weeks and you can see the tips are still black when they grow out, so I just dye them again and they look amazing every time. I would watch you tube videos for helpful tips, because again this can be messy and can burn. In fact the first time I used this I made a mess by getting the step one in my eye and not realizing it till I put step two on and it burned so bad I swore I wouldn&#x27;t use it again, but as I perfected my technique I don&#x27;t make that mistake.</li>
    <li> The only reason I chose 1 star was because I didn&#x27;t have the option to give it 0. I am a licenses cosmetologist. I am well aware of what I am doing with these products and have used others similar. I used this product yesterday for the first time on a client and IT WAS HORRIBLE. More of the product stayed on my fingers rather than her lashes, the fumes were burning her eyes and on the box, it says if you get the color on the skin, use the stain remover immediately, so I did. I did the process twice because she didn&#x27;t like the result of the first one (she wanted them darker) and the box says that&#x27;s okay. She called me 5 hours later and sent me a picture of her eye. RED, SWOLLEN, AND THE COLOR CAME OFF HER LASHED WHEN SHE WASHED HER FACE. Are you kidding me?! The stain remover burnt her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you do, do NOT use this</li>
    <li> My hair is the color of a tree trunk. For real, look out the window--it&#x27;s that ash-y grey color without being grey. I&#x27;m only 27. I guess it could be called ash blonde? Dirty dishwater blonde?My eyelashes and eyebrows are the same, kinda brown with blond tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tint worked great, but only after I went and got disposable mascara wands. The package comes with wooden sticks, and the instructions say to &amp;#34;tightly wrap a small piece of cotton around the end&amp;#34;. So you make your own q-tip and apply the two solutions with that. Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Imagine applying mascara with a q-tip and you know what I mean. First attempt was an epic failure, second attempt with mascara wands worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the tint does tint. However, you need to stop into your local department store (or Whole Foods makeup section like I did) and kindly ask the team member if you can take home a few of their disposable mascara wands.</li>
    <li> easy to apply.  Did not smell, nor burn. I have had stains before so  I guess I expected it would look darker so I would not need mascara but I could barely tell I did anything. I can see if you have pale lashes this would be good.  Comes with everything you need so I would not buy extra until you decide you like it.</li>
    <li> It is okay, however, it does not last very long.  It lasted about ten days for me, which was a little disappointing, but it is still better than going to a salon and having it done.</li>
    <li> -Very difficult to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Does NOT come with applicators. You have to buy your own or do what they suggest and MAKE your own with the provided wooden sticks and your own provided cotton (they pretty much just instruct you to make your own q-tip)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Results were not very vivid and I did not want to suffer through another round like the instructions suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Might be fine for some people, or if you have a friend who can help you apply the product</li>
    <li> I used to have my lashes tinted at a local salon, but this is so much cheaper!  The first time I used Roux Lash &amp; Brow Tint, I attempted the process by myself.  Definitely have a friend help you (it will burn if it gets in your eyes!) and definitely use petroleum jelly on the skin around your eyes because this product will definitely stain your eye lids.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. Since I am a blond it give me natural looking color on my brows.</li>
    <li> I have strawberry-blonde hair, eyebrows, and lashes.  I thought I would write a review for those with my hair coloring.  I bought this specifically for my lashes in the BROWN. Without mascara and liner on, I look like I dont have any lashes at all...they are sooo blonde!  This product works very well! The first time I used it, I did get some in my eyes and it didnt even bother me! This product has given me more confidence in my appearance without makeup.  WORDS OF ADVICE: Follow the directions! 1) Use vaseline around your eyes but becareful not to get any on your lashes because the lashes with not color if the vaseline is on them. If you get some on your eyelids, the stain will stick around for 4-5 days.  I know from experience, unfortunately. 2) Instead of the applicator sticks they give you, I used GUM Soft-picks located in the dental isle to apply the solutions.  (I&#x27;m a dental hygienist. I had these laying in my bathroom drawer and they worked awesome!) 3) Other than that, do one eye at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a second application about a week later, not because the color was fading but because I wanted to see if I could get closer to my roots and I saw even better results. I do not recommend this to use on strawberry-blonde, or blonde, eyebrows....even with the BROWN, it would turn out way too dark and not look natural.</li>
    <li> I have blond lashes and have used this for years.  The last batch I had didn&#x27;t work very well until I noticed it had expired 7 years ago.  Very happy with the new package.  Occasionally my outer lashes don&#x27;t dye as dark, so I just re-dye them the next day.  I used to pay $30 at salons but this is much easier - I find I can get closer to the roots and have even purposefully dyed in eyeliner when going on vacation so I don&#x27;t have to wear eye makeup at all.  Also, I haven&#x27;t actually tried this on my eyebrows, but I think it would be too dark for me. If you start, start with eyelashes and decide if you want that color on your eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I am a strawberry blonde with lashes which are pretty long, but since the tips of my lashes are so light, they appear to be shorter than they are.  This product is ideal for that type of issue.  It doesn&#x27;t make you look like you are wearing mascara, intensely made-up, but it does darken all of your lashes, giving you an enhanced but very natural looking result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of how easy this product really is to use, the person who showed me how to use it did so on a coffee break, in the women&#x27;s lounge at our office, in crummy lighting, leaning over a multi-sink counter where we couldn&#x27;t even get that close to the mirror.  All we did was take a cotton swab and dip it in the first solution, dabbed that onto our lashes, then repeated with the second solution.  No need for petroleum jelly, pads, or anything else.  Note however that I am an artist with a stable hand, and I am not a jumpy person.  If you lack a steady hand, and/or are jumpy, you should take the necessary precautions when using this product. We on a later occasion tried to show another co-worker how to use this product, but she was a fumbler, and ended up getting a small skin stain (went away; but still, no one wants that even briefly).  I would suggest that you undertake application when you won&#x27;t be disturbed or face a potential emergency such as pulling your child away from some dangerous thing the little darling decided to do when your back was turned.  :)  Even if you need to do the extra prep steps, this is still a ridiculously easy product to use, truthfully.  I think that most women, having so much experience applying cosmetics, are pretty adept at fiddling with things around their eyes safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the dye lasted quite a while.  I think people&#x27;s eyelashes fall out and new ones grow in on a fairly short cycle, so whatever that cycle is for you will indicate how often you&#x27;d probably need to re-dye.  But especially if you can do the quick-and-easy method, it takesliterally only seconds to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used both the brown and the black.  I thought the brown was pretty and it definitely gave me more definition than not using it, but generally speaking I think you get more bang for your buck going with the black.  The black isn&#x27;t going to look strange or harsh even on a fair-skinned redhead, because it is such a normal, natural looking effect (not a built-up mascara look).  Note of course that for an evening out or other event, you can use mascara over this; I never found that using makeup remover to take off mascara affected the lash dye.  But most of the time you won&#x27;t need to bother with mascara; that&#x27;s just if you happen to want a more dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need so very little of the products each time that you will probably choose to replace it long before you really use it all up.  Out of paranoia re anything I use near my eyes, I tend to replace all such products pretty quickly.  This one I usually keep for about a year, since I never put a used cotton swab back into the containers.</li>
    <li> I have really blonde hair and have always hated how it looks without makeup on, after using this on my eyes and eyebrows its soooo much better. I suggest using a clean mascara wand to apply it, works a lot better than what they tell you to use. It also is not TOO black it took me two applications to get the color I wanted. But that is much better than it being too dark and having to try and go backwards. Very fast shipping would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORSE EYELASH/BROW TINT I HAVE EVER USED!  I AM A LICENSED ESTHETICIAN AND PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST, AND LET ME TELL YOU, YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE THIS.  NOT ONLY IS IT THE ODDEST APPLICATION PROCESS, IT BURNS LIKE FIRE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO TO KEEP IT OUT OF YOUR EYES!!!  AND GUESS WHAT?  THE COLOR REMOVER, IT&#x27;S BLEACH!  I DON&#x27;T MEAN THE TYPICAL BUFFERED COSMETIC STAIN REMOVERS, I MEAN ACTUAL BLEACH LIKE CLOROX!  READ THE INGREDIENTS, IT&#x27;S THE SAME CHEMICAL!  HOW IN THE WORLD DID THEY MARKET THIS PRODUCT TO USE ACTUAL BLEACH NEAR THE EYES??????  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I DID NOT PURCHASE FROM AMAZON, AS I WAS IN A HURRY AND BOUGHT THIS FROM A LOCAL SALLY&#x27;S BEAUTY SUPPLY.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> You should go to a GOOD salon and get your lashes tinted there first to see if this is something you would like to keep on doing going forward.  Also to understand that if you have fair skimpy lashes it will just give you dark skimpy lashes.  I have normal fair lashes and the only moment I am able to see a true difference is when I dye them and then use an eyelash curler to play them up. The dye also makes my lashes a tiny bit thicker but if you are expecting miracles get latisse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay here is the deal.  I do not follow the \\&quot;how to apply instructions\\&quot; but only because I have been doing this a long time.  And don&#x27;t even get me started on the stain guards that I am supposed to place under my eye, I don&#x27;t use them. I dip a toothpick in the solution and use it as a (lash) want to apply the liquids.  I find that for my purposes this give me more control. Additionally, the toothpicks I use have a square base and that&#x27;s the side I use.  Sometimes, I allow the tint to get on the base of my upper lashes and tint the skin and it ends up looking like liner and I usually do this at night and don&#x27;t wash it off until the morning shower and even then lightly with a bit of water.  In the event the dye drips on my face I wipe it off immediately with a Qtip and as such have never used the given remover.  If you wipe it off your skin right away, you will not need to.  Know that if you get the liquid in your eyes in will sting like hell AND sooner or later it will happen and you will mess up the job.  That&#x27;s life.  If you get liquid on your nails, clothes, white wooden surface, etc, it will stain.  I use the product once a week and that has saved me $25+ that I used to spend a month doing this at the salon.  I must stress this again, I have been doing this for a long time and feel comfortable doing it my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product but as previously[[ASIN:B000BPMB2Y Roux Lash &amp; Brow Tint Black 1.5 oz.]] stated be realistic about your expectations.  If you have normalto full fair lashes and use a lash curler you will see a difference.  It is important for you to know that application is cumbersome and some of you will not be successful or patient enough to figure it out and the product is a dye thus it will stain that is its job.  In reading some of the not so good reviews I suspect they had unrealistic expectations and were not successfully able to work with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first try I would recommend latex gloves to protect your fingers.  Even I have the occasional mishap.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for fifteen years, and I am still happy with it.  I dye my eyebrows about once a week to keep the desired color.  I used to dye my eyelashes as well, but it got in my eyes too often, and it stung horribly, so I have my lashes professionally done instead.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the product.  It worked, but didn&#x27;t stay on for very long, and it was messy too!</li>
    <li> My eyebrows are full but have a lot of gray color.  This product is fairly easy to use and it lasts about a month or more.  I use Qtips rather than the sticks they give you and I put a dap of vaseline on the paper shields they give you and fix them on my eyelid to protect the eye while I am working on the brow.  So I end up using 4 Qtips and 4 paper shields since I put the number 1 on each brow first to let it dry, and then the number 2 on each brow.  I think the stain remover works well if it gets on the skin.  Two things I have noticed is that the number 1 solution gets brown over time even though I never \\&quot;double dip\\&quot; the Qtip.  And the other thing is that if it gets on the counter it is very hard to get off.</li>
    <li> This works quickly- suggest you use very little of the second step as it darkens immediately. I thought I&#x27;d look like Groucho- bit color ok by next morning. Dont do this the first time if you have something important to do in case it comes off too dark!</li>
    <li> The results don&#x27;t last very long have to use about once a week, in order for brows to stay dark.</li>
    <li> Too hard for me to use.  I have to defer to the professionals.</li>
    <li> It burns wayyyy worse then any other tint Ive ever used and if you want really black lashes, you need to do this about 4 times in a row. Also...if you get ANY on your skin....be prepared to have it stay there for a while because the remover doesnt work.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice so far and I am really, really happy with it. I&#x27;ve had professional eyebrow &amp; eyelash dye done at a salon, and this is the stuff they used, so the product has already paid for itself in one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here are some tips and pitfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have dark brown hair and I am about 25% grey, which includes my brows and eyelashes. The black dye is too dark for my brows, as it would be for most people. But it did a fantastic job on my eyelashes-- it looks like I&#x27;m wearing mascara, which is what I wanted. I am going to buy the brown for my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is very easy to use, but those little application sticks they give you are really useless. I used disposable mascara applicators and a magnifying mirror, and it was very easy. I used a separate set of applicators for each eye and did each eye slowly, but even so, I got a little bit on my lower eye, which left a little spot. So don&#x27;t try to be thrifty and not use too many applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If it gets on your skin, have a wet q-tip ready to go to remove the dye. It might leave a spot on your skin, but that will go away in 24 hours or so, at least it did in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Another tip-- I have a weird streak of grey hair on my hairline that grows out so fast and drives me crazy. I used this dye to cover up that little patch on my hairline, it worked so fast! Instant, permanent, touch-up. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a touch up for my regular hair dye, of course, but to color 10-15 hairs right in the front it&#x27;s great! Now I don&#x27;t have to pluck them or try to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; them with one of those dye pens that wash out after one shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, this is a great product with great results, but just go slow, do one eye at a time, and use the black for eyelashes and the brown for your eyebrows (if you have brown hair). Good luck.</li>
    <li> Totally Satisfied!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Might not last a month, but a good three weeks.  Easy to use (I don&#x27;t use the enclosed paper pads or wood picks because smearing petroleum jelly is more effective).  No other lash tint that I&#x27;m aware of comes with a remover if color gets outside wanted area.  VERY GOOD.</li>
    <li> I love getting my brows and lashes tinted, but no salons close to home.  So, I thought I would try to do it myself.  This product is easy to use, even for a beginner.  Yes, I wasn&#x27;t perfect my first time, but the color remover worked perfectly.  After 3 weeks, my tint is still going strong.  For the color I wanted, I only needed one application.  If you want a deeper jet black color, just use two applications. Looking forward to my touch up application without the expense and hassle of going to a salon!</li>
    <li> This really doesn&#x27;t work for lashes and you cannot return it.</li>
    <li> I use this product to dye my eyebrows and it lasts for 2-3 weeks.  Saves me time every morning not having to draw my eyebrows on.  so easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product did NOTHING.  I followed the directions carefully and tried it three different times with absolutely NO results.  I will never waste my money on this again.</li>
