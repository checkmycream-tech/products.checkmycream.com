      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>Without seeing a podiatrist, this is as good as it gets if it is simply a meager problem</li>
      <li>and I am able to maintain results with decreased number of uses per week too.</li>
      <li>It took a little longer than expected to finish the job, but it did work well and was easy to use.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past two years and the results are fantastic. I would recommend it anyone with fungal infection. It takes a while to see the results, but it&#x27;s worth it. I would like to thank Sonja for recommending Footlogix to me.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Easy to use.  It took a little longer than expected to finish the job, but it did work well and was easy to use.  I am going to recommend it to the one who does my pedicures.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective foot care brand I have tried. Recommend both this and the dry skin anti fungal formula foam. The bottles last forever and I am able to maintain results with decreased number of uses per week too. Only downside is the contain parabens, but luckily in very small percentage.</li>
    <li> Excellent service from the provider. I purchased this item for my mother as it was recommended from a friend.  She has really liked this product and it seems to be helping her foot issues.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is a proven entity!  apply two times per day and chances are that you will watch your issue resolve without a prescription or oral remedy</li>
    <li> I use this every day. Works great!!</li>
    <li> Here is an item which requires little effort to fix your feet with and feel better today tommorrow and the next day.</li>
    <li> Have used this item twice a day for about a month and it does work. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to really work. I&#x27;ve had problems&lt;br /&gt;for a long time and this spray is helping to rid my toes&lt;br /&gt;of the problem. Will order another soon so as to not be&lt;br /&gt;without it in the future.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Product only has three or four uses Jan the can.</li>
    <li> I use this to remove fungus from my big toenails.  It works, but you must apply it daily until the fungus damaged nail grows out and is cut off.  In other words, a few months.  Nevertheless, the fungus will then be gone.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Foot Doctor! Had a fungus on one foot - rub it on 2x a day and it works! Hard to find locally so I sent for it.</li>
    <li> I chose the 5 star rating for this product because it got rid of my toenail fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to any one who has a fungus under their toenail</li>
    <li> A professional at an exclusive spa in Seattle, suggested this product to me. That was over 1 year ago and my toe funcus has disappeared. Dr. Oz how said you much get below the nail - with the power in the spray - that is just what this product does.</li>
    <li> Without seeing a podiatrist, this is as good as it gets if it is simply a meager problem</li>
    <li> great product. Great value and this works wonders! Saw this product on QVC and the price offered through Amazon couldn&#x27;t be beat especially in the bundle that was offered. I would definitely order from this seller again. Shipping was as promised.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this stuff didn&#x27;t do anything for my funky feet.  I have since bought Kerasol and am already noticing improvement.</li>
    <li> This product was recomended to me at a high end spa.  They said stick with it &amp; you&#x27;ll see clear nails in about 6 months.  They were right! It is quick &amp; easy to use. I didn&#x27;t even use it as often as recommended &amp; it still cleared my nails with perserverence.  I love it and will never stop using this product! Better than any other OTC product.  I know, I&#x27;ve tried them all. Footlogix really works!!!</li>
    <li> i was introduced to footlogix at the spa i was working at never had a problem before but recently ive been seeing some lifting i automatically had to have this ! footlogix products works wonders !</li>
    <li> This was very effective on one nail that had only had the fungus for a few months, but completely ineffective on another nail where the fungus was over a year old. Used through two spray containers. Have not reordered.</li>
    <li> i must have a bad case of fungal attack as this product, which came recommended, did not seem to do anything. I am working on my 3rd bottle of daily application. Might have made a slight dent, but really not too noticeable in the reduction of toenail fungus</li>
    <li> Very good service and good product.</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase.  My wife does a lot of Yoga and walking stocking foot or barefoot is a quick way to pick up a fungus.  She swears by this stuff and it has no odor.</li>
    <li> Use in AM and PM after washing feet - be consistent.  Then spray then results start</li>
    <li> Seems to work.  It&#x27;s expensive and has to be used frequently to help remove the fungus and KEEP IT AWAY.  So far, I&#x27;m happy.  It was recommended by my Spa.  The Doctor wanted to prescribe pills for 6 months.  Seemed like over-kill.  Happy I bought the product - so far so good.</li>
    <li> Have been using this about a week or 10 and have seen radical improvement in an infection I have had  for decades but could not metabolize the drug for.  I tried the usual care, the expensive application in the bottle painted on, then Vicks vaporub.  But frequent clipping, cleaning, twice daily application of this and lots of exposure to air of this is giving me some dramatic changes.  Highest recommendation if your liver can&#x27;t take the pills.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product got so many positive reviews for toe nail fungus, it is completely ineffective for this, even says it on the bottle. I tried it anyway and it did not do anything for my nails, I know it takes time, but this is not the right product for toe nail fungus, only for things like athlete&#x27;s foot.</li>
