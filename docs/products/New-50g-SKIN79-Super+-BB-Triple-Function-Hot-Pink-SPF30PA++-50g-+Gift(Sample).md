      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over a year now and love that they have changed the bottle to a tube.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as part of my beauty regime and it works wonderfully without breaking out my super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>the coverage is pretty dang good for bb cream.</li>
      <li>Same awesome product but with higher sunblock protection and more product!  </li>
      <li>Only one shade which happens to be perfect for my light ivory skin.</li>
      <li>the color is very true to what is described.</li>
      <li>My skin is a bit pink toned, so this works perfectly for  me.</li>
      <li>Great coverage but looks natural.</li>
      <li>but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>I have fair, cool-toned skin, so this compliments it really well.</li>
      <li>Super happy and shipping was extremely fast.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know if they have different shades, but I personally like bright skin tone and this one works perfect for me</li>
      <li>But this covers nicely and makes skin pretty.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to blend, it&#x27;s pretty creamy, lighter than my skin color</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan.</li>
      <li>I was happy to see that they changed the bottle to the squeeze tube with a pump but the product is not the same.</li>
      <li>but I still enjoy it.  </li>
      <li>but this always goes on smoothly and looks like nothing.</li>
      <li>but it changed to fit my skin tone after a minute or so.</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved the old version.</li>
      <li>it is super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I agree with kmar that the new formula has a more matte finish!</li>
      <li>love this product, I am Caucasian and have been using this for about a year, blends nicely and protects from daily sun damage</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of Asian bb creams and this is by far the best!  </li>
      <li>but this new formula is better in its smooth powdery finish and it stays in place more time, the old formula stays perfect on my face for no more than 4 hours, this one stays elegant for 6 hours</li>
      <li>It matches my skin really well and goes on very smoothly.</li>
      <li>hard to figure out perfect amount .</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t dry out your skin, and it has a very light, nice texture.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
      <li>I dont need full coverage and prefer light/barely there coverage.  </li>
      <li>I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA WHEN TO ORDER MORE THAN OTHER WAYS</li>
      <li>Super full coverage.</li>
      <li>All around I love the new formula and packaging!</li>
      <li>I find it best to mix two different shades - especially if you tan during the year.</li>
      <li>AS IT GOES ON,IT HAS A GRAY TINT BUT WILL QUICKLY BLEND TO YOUR SKIN COLOR.</li>
      <li>An important thing to keep in mind is that this product is matte, and although matte it is not drying and pretty lightweight w/ a medium coverage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are willing to accept a return but don&#x27;t bother, it will cost over 12.00 to return ship!</li>
      <li>such an amazing product.</li>
      <li>Oh well, I can see that the finish could look nice if you have light pink tone skin.</li>
      <li>but unfortunately I&#x27;m not crazy about the product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using a makeup sponge (beautyblender style) with this product, it makes a huge difference in your ability to layer and just gives a more natural look.</li>
      <li>I really like Korean and Japanese products because my asian type of skin, this one has good coverage and is very smooth to be applied</li>
      <li>Delivered earlier than expected and am happy to see this bbcream was the real deal. :-)</li>
      <li>have a natural light beige skin tone.</li>
      <li>This packaging is so much nicer!</li>
      <li>so i had to try them first</li>
      <li>I like the other benefits of the product and having tried other BB creams this always has proven to be my best choice.  </li>
      <li>It gives you the illusion of clear, smooth skin.</li>
      <li>somehow it absorbs/blends into your skin within 15minutes and gives light, natural looking</li>
      <li>At first, when you put this on it looks sort of gray.</li>
      <li>I like the tube design better since its easier to tell when you&#x27;re running low and its easier to store in a drawer or when traveling.</li>
      <li>Personally this bb cream works better for me because you need less product for more coverage  while Missha bb cream has a thinner consistency (something between liquid and cream foundation) with light to medium coverage and takes longer to build coverage.</li>
      <li>Also really enjoying the new tube compared to the old bottle that I had to pull apart and unscrew to get the remnants after the pump stopped working.</li>
      <li>especially for super light skinned people.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin with yellow undertones and this was just a bit lighter than my natural skin tone, which is not bad just different</li>
      <li>I finally got a chance to try out the product, and I love the new revision!</li>
      <li>It made the dry patches more noticeable, but that&#x27;s my fault for not moisturizing correctly.</li>
      <li>Used the original Pink BB in the original canister format.</li>
      <li>I saw the old 2013 formulation on some ex-roommates with medium warm skin tones and it looked ashy and grey on them all day</li>
      <li>The shipping package was fine, but my product was destroyed: Box was ripped, tube seam split open, and the pump was shattered.</li>
      <li>That alone is very unsatisfactory.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product helps provide a base of nice, even tone for the rest of my makeup.</li>
    <li> The renewed formula has a more matte finish and better oil control. They also removed harmful ingredients from the old formula like the parabens and added eco ingredients, like pink blooming complex and Acerola that helps brighten your skin. They also increased the sun protection from SPF 25 to 30. I like the tube design better since its easier to tell when you&#x27;re running low and its easier to store in a drawer or when traveling. The USSellerAsiianSkinCare seller will also give you a sheet mask as an extra gift!</li>
    <li> Delivered earlier than expected and am happy to see this bbcream was the real deal. :-)</li>
    <li> I finally got a chance to try out the product, and I love the new revision! It won&#x27;t dry out your skin, and it has a very light, nice texture.&lt;br /&gt;However, don&#x27;t expect much coverage.</li>
    <li> I was actually disappointed with the new formulation. I absolutely loved the old version. It was a perfect seamless match for my skin. It was my holy grail face product for over two years. With the new formula, it dries to a powdery finish and the tone is lighter. Since my skin is on the dry side, the powder finish looks terrible.I was happy to see that they changed the bottle to the squeeze tube with a pump but the product is not the same. I can see it working well for oily/combo skinned ladies though.</li>
    <li> The shipping package was fine, but my product was destroyed: Box was ripped, tube seam split open, and the pump was shattered. Plus I believe there was supposed to be a sample, but I did not have one [Not that I went digging too deep into the package!]</li>
    <li> I am so in love wit this BB cream. I am a huge fan. I have fair, cool-toned skin, so this compliments it really well. Since BB cream oxidizes, don&#x27;t be alarmed if the color looks grey when you first apply it. It only lasts a minute. I have been receiving even more compliments on my skin lately. Super happy and shipping was extremely fast. Will be purchasing again as soon as I&#x27;&#x27;m running low.</li>
    <li> I feel like this bb cream isn&#x27;t as grey toned as most other bb creams, but it still is ya feel? It&#x27;s very long lasting and as a filipino w/ a medium-fair  skin tone, it worked quite well for me, it oxidized pretty well.  An important thing to keep in mind is that this product is matte, and although matte it is not drying and pretty lightweight w/ a medium coverage. I bought this product expecting it to be dewy like the full sized dispenser bc of my dry skin type but I still enjoy it.  However i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for acne prone skin bc it may accentuate the peeling and dry areas.</li>
    <li> I love it put it dosent give me the natural look :(</li>
    <li> my skin looks shine and bright. I am 43 asian female</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED A BB CREAM YOU ARE MISSING OUT. THIS IS MY VERY FAVORITE PRODUCT!! ALWAYS BUY FROM SKIN 79,IT NEVER DISAPPOINTS. IT HAS SUN SCREEN AND I LOVE THE WAY IT MAKES MY SKIN GLOW. DON&#x27;T BE PUT OFF BY THE COLOR. AS IT GOES ON,IT HAS A GRAY TINT BUT WILL QUICKLY BLEND TO YOUR SKIN COLOR. THIS 50 GRAM TUBE IS THE BEST VALUE. I THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A BETTER IDEA WHEN TO ORDER MORE THAN OTHER WAYS IT IS OFFERED.THIS IS MY FAV OF ALL THE DIFFERENT BB CREAMS.WILL BUY THIS FOR MT TEENAGE GRANDDAUGHTER, SHE LOVES TO USE MINE.IT WILL BE LIGHT ENOUGH IN COVERAGE FOR HER.I ADD A SMALL AMOUNT OF MY NORMAL FOUNDATION FOR MORE HOLDING POWER THROUGHOUT THE DAY.</li>
    <li> love this product, I am Caucasian and have been using this for about a year, blends nicely and protects from daily sun damage</li>
    <li> What can I say? I don&#x27;t understand why this line only has one shade for each type of bb cream. Other top brands such as Missha, Etude House, and Innisfree all have 2 to 4 tones for each type of bb cream in their brand. I have oily skin so I am limited to the skin79 pink version or the green version. Both are too pink, grey and light for my light-medium yellow Asian skin. I saw the old 2013 formulation on some ex-roommates with medium warm skin tones and it looked ashy and grey on them all day so I didn&#x27;t want to try it. But when the new formulation came out, I thought I would give it a shot, but it&#x27;s still the same. It&#x27;s too grey even after oxidation. It&#x27;s really strange that they don&#x27;t make a yellow-tone bb cream for oily skin Asians considering that this is a Korean company. Oh well, I can see that the finish could look nice if you have light pink tone skin.</li>
    <li> I will only buy this foundation from now on. This is about the 5th time I&#x27;ve bought it. I am obsessed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a natural light beige skin tone. At first, when you put this on it looks sort of gray. After i apply this i usually will do my hair or brush my teeth etc. just to let time pass. Once I&#x27;m done (after about 10-15 minutes) the foundation is my exact skin tone and it looks flawless. Then i apply my bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it because i don&#x27;t have to apply primer</li>
    <li> I really like Korean and Japanese products because my asian type of skin, this one has good coverage and is very smooth to be applied, I don&#x27;t know if they have different shades, but I personally like bright skin tone and this one works perfect for me, it&#x27;s even better than some big US brands, but those brands might just suits more for white people who have different skin texture.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out like most makeup but the color seems darker than what I got in the cylinder container.  I&#x27;m going to look for a new BB creams.</li>
    <li> I think the BB cream has a very good coverage, but also a little bit too thick for my face.  I  have some acne after using it.  In my case, I may use it as a foundation or mix it with other BB cream.</li>
    <li> Perfect match for my pale pale Irish American Caucasian sensitive skin. So difficult to find a product that does not look too orange or grey. this lightens a bit after it dries. My only concern with the new packaging is that it squirts too much. I pump on the back of my hand and apply with a kabuki brush.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and love that they have changed the bottle to a tube.  It was always so hard to figure out how much I had left and when to reorder.  This packaging is so much nicer!</li>
    <li> I love this bb cream ! I&#x27;ve tried all the American brands of bb creams and it did not match my skin complexion. The lightest color was still too dark for me and also broke me out. I love this bb cream because it&#x27;s more for people with lighter skin and it covers very well. It did not break me out and it also made my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I felt a difference in my skin just after a few uses. This product feels heavy when you put it on, but after it drys, it has a much lighter feel without feeling sticky on your skin. The color is greyish and adjusts to your skin. This will make your skin look a little lighter. I have a natural beige skin tone (with yellow undertones) and this cream definitely made my skin look about half a shade lighter than usual. I still think the color matches well though and it doesnt look you didnt match your foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several dark spots and scars from acne and this cream covers it all. It gives you the illusion of clear, smooth skin. The thing I like is that this product does not clog my pores and cause acne (a problem with regular liquid foundation). If anything, I felt this cream helped the appearance of my skin and improved texture over time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Same awesome product but with higher sunblock protection and more product!  Win/win.  I like the new packaging as well as it takes up less space.</li>
    <li> I have been using the old formula of this hot pink BB and I was very happy with it , some people complain of its ash colour but I found this colour suits my face perfectly so I had no problem with this point but the new formula is more grey and a little bit darker ... I prefer the old colour but this new formula is better in its smooth powdery finish and it stays in place more time, the old formula stays perfect on my face for no more than 4 hours, this one stays elegant for 6 hours&lt;br /&gt;I love both of them,</li>
    <li> I loved this product before they changed the formula, not sure why they didn&#x27;t just start producing it as a separate line of BB instead of trying to fix something that wasn&#x27;t broken. It&#x27;s so much more drying than it used to be and the powder finish just ends up looking very cakey and heavy. I&#x27;m also starting to figure out that I&#x27;ve been developing a LOT more closed comedones and breakouts since I&#x27;ve started using this product. This is very frustrating as the old formula really was fantastic.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bb cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it, I was disappointed. It goes on VERY heavy. Super full coverage. I dont need full coverage and prefer light/barely there coverage.  I decided to leave it on for the day anyways (running late with no time to wash my face)....somehow it absorbs/blends into your skin within 15minutes and gives light, natural looking coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I apply this, brush my hair/get dressed, and by the time I&#x27;m ready for the rest of my makeup it looks as natural as can be!</li>
    <li> Love this product. would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> i have VERY pale skin &amp; i&#x27;ve always had difficulty trying to find any makeup that matched my complexion. (by very pale, i mean i&#x27;ve had people assume i was albino before). after much frustration, &amp; watching plenty of youtube videos, i found out about how awesome korean bb creams are. especially for super light skinned people. skin79 had some of the best reviews so i had to try them first &amp; i still havent switched. the color is very true to what is described. it is super easy to apply. i usually do 1 - 2 applications, depending on my skin that day. the coverage is pretty dang good for bb cream. i have oily skin throughout the day, &amp; as long as i put a powder over this you&#x27;d never know. some days my face looks kind of oily (if i dont use a powder), but that should be expected if you&#x27;re already typically oily. ive been using the same tube for almost 4 months &amp; i still have yet to run out. &amp; i wear this every day! such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> The best bb cream there is! I have light, pink toned skin and this works perfectly for me. It matches my skin really well and goes on very smoothly. Some bb creams dry me out or end up looking uneven but this always goes on smoothly and looks like nothing. It feels like I&#x27;m wearing no makeup basically but has light/medium coverage - better than most tinted moisturizers. I have tried a lot of Asian bb creams and this is by far the best!  NOTE: Be careful buying on here! Some of the stores might not sell the real thing. I actually just bought some from SokoGlam, which is a store I trust. Some of the stores though Amazon might be trustworthy, but definitely do your research. I have received products before from Amazon that were not real!</li>
    <li> Great seller but unfortunately I&#x27;m not crazy about the product. Looks cakey on my skin but I love the fact that it has spf!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bb cream for 6 months. It is very easy to blend, it&#x27;s pretty creamy, lighter than my skin color so I mix it with a tinted moisturizer that is a few shades darker than my skin to make a custom shade. I find it best to mix two different shades - especially if you tan during the year. I have combination skin type (oily T-zone and dry around the cheeks) and this product works for me. Previously I used Missha bb cream for years and decided that I wanted to try a new product. Personally this bb cream works better for me because you need less product for more coverage  while Missha bb cream has a thinner consistency (something between liquid and cream foundation) with light to medium coverage and takes longer to build coverage. Also I do set it with a powder because I tend to sweat.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and keep purchasing it over any other BB cream.  It is light but darkens and blends in within a short time.  It stays on well even through workouts and still looks respectable.  Not heavy and covers discoloration well.  Having older skin I like the other benefits of the product and having tried other BB creams this always has proven to be my best choice.  I am 64 so I hope this helps older users.</li>
    <li> Good product just for bb cream- great for daytime, leaves me feeling moisturized. Only problem is- nighttime flash photography wearing bb cream looks bad. So I ended up switching to something else for foundation.</li>
    <li> Love it. My skin looks brighter, this is my second day applying it and I already had compliments. My skin is a bit pink toned, so this works perfectly for  me.</li>
    <li> Used the original Pink BB in the original canister format. It came out perfectly. This format allows the product to separate and you get uneven  thinner/heavier cream. Therefore application is uneven.That alone is very unsatisfactory. The smooth perfectly mixed texture is compromised by uneven dispersal.&lt;br /&gt;They are willing to accept a return but don&#x27;t bother, it will cost over 12.00 to return ship!</li>
    <li> Looks grey at first, then changes to match skin tone. Sometimes I still feel a little grey so I put bronzer on after. But this covers nicely and makes skin pretty.</li>
    <li> Little surprised at first because it seemed darker then the old version (the one that came in the pump container) but it changed to fit my skin tone after a minute or so. I&#x27;ve only used it once or twice but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I used the original product before this one, so I was a little skeptical about a new, improved formula.  I got it sooner than later on the estimated arrival, still took a little over a month but is worth the wait.  I only need one pumps worth to cover my whole face, evening out any redness and hiding the imperfections without feeling oily or heavy.  I&#x27;m very pale and can&#x27;t find any other foundation or bb cream that doesn&#x27;t turn my complexion into a shade that won&#x27;t match my neck and just looks off.  This is perfect.  Don&#x27;t need to do a lot of blending, the container is easily used, love it!</li>
    <li> I agree with kmar that the new formula has a more matte finish! I definitely think this product lasts a lot longer than the previous formula, which is also a nice plus. I saw some slightly negative reviews about problems with the powder finish, but I think it depends on your skin type. I have combination/oily skin and the product works great for me! I think the hot pink bb cream is geared/marketed toward oily skin types anyways, so it should work well for the majority of people who purchase it. All around I love the new formula and packaging!</li>
    <li> I like old version better.&lt;br /&gt;This one make my face tooo fake like using foundation .&lt;br /&gt;Also one pumping was way to much. hard to figure out perfect amount .</li>
    <li> This is the only fountation I&#x27;ve used since I found it (about a year). It is great... Only one shade which happens to be perfect for my light ivory skin. Great coverage but looks natural. This seller had it at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have combination skin with dry patches here and there. This BB cream went on looking very grey, then fully oxidized after about 10 minutes. It made the dry patches more noticeable, but that&#x27;s my fault for not moisturizing correctly. I have fair skin with yellow undertones and this was just a bit lighter than my natural skin tone, which is not bad just different (I still have to get used to it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to blot my skin after 5 hours, however, I didn&#x27;t use a face primer. It gave decent coverage, but is definitely for those who have clearer skin. I would recommend you try it at least once to really judge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I included pictures of the box and tube here, in case someone wanted to see what they looked like. I&#x27;ve never used SKIN79 products before, but it looks to be authentic. I purchased from seller Package_go_fast and got 2 free samples!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as part of my beauty regime and it works wonderfully without breaking out my super sensitive skin. It also controls oil production so I don&#x27;t get shiny. I use it with Aveeno daily regenerating and under make-up to even out my tone since I have acne and scarring. Also really enjoying the new tube compared to the old bottle that I had to pull apart and unscrew to get the remnants after the pump stopped working.</li>
    <li> This is a great light/medium coverage balm, I really like the dewy texture it gives your skin and the color does seem to be spot on. It goes on fairly grey which initially freaked me out, but ends up matching your skin tone fairly well after a few moments. I highly recommend using a makeup sponge (beautyblender style) with this product, it makes a huge difference in your ability to layer and just gives a more natural look.</li>
