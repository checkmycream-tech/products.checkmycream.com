      <li>This product is super affordable and I honestly have never found anything that is better for my skin.  </li>
      <li>At this point it has only been 4 days since I started using this, and it is incredible what it is doing/has already done.</li>
      <li>one of the best green clay powders out there :)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It opens up the pores so if u have those plasters who are used to clean the pores on the nose, its even better.</li>
      <li>clay is very suitable for people who have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>(I went 30 mins one day and it wasn&#x27;t fun scraping this stuff off of my face!)</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and use balm cleansers to clean and oil as a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>The clay mixture appears to help shrink and clean out the pores.  </li>
      <li>Very nice product, easily mixes with water or other liquids.  </li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>What an AMAZING facial!</li>
      <li>love that it is natural and you can mix and match to anyone&#x27;s skin type.</li>
      <li>Also, as a quick mask in case you&#x27;re interested.</li>
      <li>smooth, soft, and clean pores.</li>
      <li>So, while this mask still works incredibly well in regards to removing the dreaded blackheads, it seemed to have caused a serious breakout inacne.</li>
      <li>And, its great for the price cause usually a one-time apply mask at the store costs around 2$, and</li>
      <li>So I continue to use it for the next couple days, and the next day I decide to mix in some Turmeric because I read that this was supposed to be great for your skin.</li>
      <li>me overly excited about using a new product.   </li>
      <li>I was expecting miracles after the first use.</li>
      <li>Worked very well and efficient in price!  </li>
      <li>would definitely buy some more once i run out of this.</li>
      <li>fast ship!</li>
      <li>Noticed a difference in my skin texture after the first use.</li>
      <li>This mask makes my skin feel better and look just as good as my expensive masque.</li>
      <li>It works great as a facial, but also to heal other issues with poultices.&lt;br /&gt;The seller has fast shipping, the product comes as shown and is sealed and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I discontinued using all new facial products and my face seems to have cleared up, for the most part.</li>
      <li>Also, my skin was very dry before applying it, and after it felt so much better.</li>
      <li>Its cheap enough and does what its supposed to.</li>
      <li>really works on diper rush</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but already my face feels amazing!</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re not talking 5 or 6, we&#x27;re talking way too many to count; on my nose, on the bridge of my nose, and down onto my eye socket area.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
      <li>It is really useful rather than buying a mask that is already prepared and mixed.</li>
      <li>This green clay is my favorite of all the clays I have tried.</li>
      <li>The next day I notice less redness in my sensitive skin, much smaller pores, and great affects on my acne.  </li>
      <li>I have had it almost 2 months and still have more than half the jar left!</li>
      <li>Label clearly explains product purpose and works well.</li>
      <li>It had even pulled some of them COMPLETELY OUT.</li>
      <li>you want natural product, try this one.</li>
      <li>Leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>and I search for an all natural way to get rid of them.</li>
      <li>I bought this to treat my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>With the clay you dont have to be scared that your skin may have some reaction to the chemicals because its a natural product.  </li>
      <li>I come across many items, but two stuck out; French green clay, and Witch Hazel.</li>
      <li>Extremely affordable, and surprisingly didnt weigh down my skin like my expensive top of the line skin care products.</li>
      <li>I like the green clay because it helps clean up my face from all the dirt, and it helps me with my pimples, when they show up our of nowhere.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this mask once but so far...</li>
      <li>and it takes my skin from dull and broken out to fresh, even toned and smooth!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered this product on the advise of a friend and I&#x27;m glad I did. I use the green clay as a face mask, and I can tell the difference in my skin in just three applications.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Label clearly explains product purpose and works well. I use a small amount with water or lemon juice for face masks. I have had it almost 2 months and still have more than half the jar left!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and it does wonders of removing excess oil.  I also use it in my shampoo bar recipes.  The clay in my shampoo bars gives it extra cleaning power by adsorbing excess oil and dirt.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, easily mixes with water or other liquids.  Noticed a difference in my skin texture after the first use.</li>
    <li> I mixed this product with a little bit of olive oil and manuka honey to make a face mask. My skin felt great after taking it off....smooth, soft, and clean pores. Also, my skin was very dry before applying it, and after it felt so much better. FYI...I wouldn&#x27;t advise mixing this product with egg though...it doesn&#x27;t blend well at all.</li>
    <li> I like the green clay because it helps clean up my face from all the dirt, and it helps me with my pimples, when they show up our of nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;It opens up the pores so if u have those plasters who are used to clean the pores on the nose, its even better. I usually combine them -  first the clay mask and after that the plaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay is very suitable for people who have sensitive skin. My skin is mixed, dry and on some areas it is little oily &#x3D; like the nose. With the clay you dont have to be scared that your skin may have some reaction to the chemicals because its a natural product.  And, its great for the price cause usually a one-time apply mask at the store costs around 2$, and im always careful when i get those cause im scared i may have some sort of reaction on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you want natural product, try this one. You can only gain from the benefits of the green clay mask, and this packaging will last a bit longer because it doesnt take much to make the mask.&lt;br /&gt;I usually put it on before i have a shower cause honestly its easier for me to wash it that way :-)</li>
    <li> I have had black heads since I was 15, around 11-12 years, and I am completely sick of them. We&#x27;re not talking 5 or 6, we&#x27;re talking way too many to count; on my nose, on the bridge of my nose, and down onto my eye socket area. I used Biore strips for years with pathetic success (Though I have to admit that it is rather satisfying when they do work. LoL.)  So, I decided very recently that I am sick of having this little bastards and I search for an all natural way to get rid of them. I come across many items, but two stuck out; French green clay, and Witch Hazel. I buy the Witch Hazel and then the next day I receive my Green Clay. I was expecting miracles after the first use. And while I thought I might have noticed a bit of a difference, I figured it was just placebo/me overly excited about using a new product.   So I continue to use it for the next couple days, and the next day I decide to mix in some Turmeric because I read that this was supposed to be great for your skin. I let the mask sit on a little longer than I was supposed to, at about 35 minutes, but when I washed it off, I was amazed to see that the mask had actually pulled a lot of the blackheads to the surface. It had even pulled some of them COMPLETELY OUT. I got rid of a bunch with extreme ease, and then used the Witch Hazel followed by a green tea moisturizer. Then the next day I use it, same thing. Repeat one more time.   At this point it has only been 4 days since I started using this, and it is incredible what it is doing/has already done. Its amazing what taking care of your skin can do for you! HIGHLY recommended. Also, as a quick mask in case you&#x27;re interested. One measure of Green Clay, Witch Hazel to replace the water (Or half and half) and a little Turmeric, mix together, and you have a wicked combination for a mask. Works miracles.  1.12.2012 UPDATE: So, while this mask still works incredibly well in regards to removing the dreaded blackheads, it seemed to have caused a serious breakout inacne. Now, this could be environmental as I do have a serious mold problem currently where I live, but it started a couple weeks after using the mask. I discontinued using all new facial products and my face seems to have cleared up, for the most part. I still plan on using this along with a little white willow to aid in inflammation and bacteria about once a week to once every couple weeks to avoid breakouts. Still, I would recommend this product to anyone, it is still incredible.</li>
    <li> one of the best green clay powders out there :)</li>
    <li> really works on diper rush</li>
    <li> I bought this to treat my sensitive skin. It is really useful rather than buying a mask that is already prepared and mixed. Can make multiple masks for different problems with things at home</li>
    <li> make the hole get smaller on my face &amp; white, but can&#x27;t put the powder all over the face. Only put on the problem part.</li>
    <li> This green clay is my favorite of all the clays I have tried. It works great as a facial, but also to heal other issues with poultices.&lt;br /&gt;The seller has fast shipping, the product comes as shown and is sealed and fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product weekly for years.  It is a wonderful addition to any skin regiment.  This Green Clay Mask works well on all skin types.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for a little over a month and WOOOOOOOOW! What an AMAZING facial! You can literally feel it sucking out the nasty-ness in your pores... I do it once a week (mud-mask-monday) and it takes my skin from dull and broken out to fresh, even toned and smooth! My breakouts literally dwindle after I use this stuff, and I SWEAR works over night for my pimples! You HAVE to try this stuff, and it costs waaay less then a green clay mask you would pay for at a spa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FUN TIP - If my skin is dry, I use a couple of drops of olive oil. If my skin is SUPER broken out, I use a couple drops of green tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND DONT LEAVE IT ON LONGER THEN 20 MINS!!! (I went 30 mins one day and it wasn&#x27;t fun scraping this stuff off of my face!)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it for face masks or to make detox body wraps. It arrived when it said it would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this mask once but so far...I love it ! I have oily skin and followed their advice of adding lime to it and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy some more once i run out of this.Its cheap enough and does what its supposed to.</li>
    <li> Great clay--works wonderfully in homemade mask and facial cleanser! fast ship!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with skin care so i am usually a Brand Buyer, but budgets getting tight so i heard raving reviews on this product and had to try it. love that it is natural and you can mix and match to anyone&#x27;s skin type. Extremely affordable, and surprisingly didnt weigh down my skin like my expensive top of the line skin care products. This mask makes my skin feel better and look just as good as my expensive masque. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I mix a little Argan oil along with a bit of water when I use this.  I have been simplifying my skincare routine over the last several months and use about once a week.  I have combination skin and use balm cleansers to clean and oil as a moisturizer.  The clay mixture appears to help shrink and clean out the pores.  Love it.</li>
    <li> be careful to NOT let it get too hard! otherwise when you move your face, it hurts!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Leaves your hair soft and manageable. Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but already my face feels amazing! It&#x27;s high quality clay at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Worked very well and efficient in price!  Won&#x27;t need to order anymore for a while but considering using it as a mask now also.</li>
    <li> This product is super affordable and I honestly have never found anything that is better for my skin.  One jar has lasted me at least 2.5 years.  I try to use it as a mask once a week.  The next day I notice less redness in my sensitive skin, much smaller pores, and great affects on my acne.  The acne shrinks, gets less painful, and less red.</li>
