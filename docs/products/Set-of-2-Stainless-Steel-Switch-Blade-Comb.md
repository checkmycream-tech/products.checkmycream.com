      <li>Cute way to get the grandsons to comb their hair!</li>
      <li>, I bought these to make into a ridiculously cheap prop switchblade, and for that it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
      <li>It is a bit cheap but great as a novelty toy (why I got it)</li>
      <li>But has held up nicely in my pocket and wards off</li>
      <li>These look nice.</li>
      <li>its all metal just liked I had hoped but the comb part is plastic</li>
      <li>Not thick comb and a bit flimsy, but for the price they are great!</li>
      <li>The lock to keep the comb closed is not the greatest quality, but for the price--it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>

      <li>:) Cute gift idea.</li>
      <li>My nephews will love them</li>
      <li>Glad we checked Amazon before we made the purchase.</li>
      <li>The heaviness of it also makes it feel more metal-authentic.</li>
      <li>I loved it greats work looks like plastic, but it&#x27;s pretty durable</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure someone with more talent and patience could do something really fantastic with it.</li>
      <li>They are very cheaply priced, and indeed cheaply made.</li>
      <li>These were very fun while they lasted, but the metal was very cheap</li>
      <li>very cool, I remember those</li>

      <li>Very nifty combs, my boyfriend loved them.</li>
      <li>Plastic, and break easily, wasn&#x27;t amused</li>

      <li>they work fine</li>
      <li>Purchased for my son, he likes them and seem to work fine on his hair</li>
      <li>Conclusion: be glad this is a set of two because one will give out REALLY quickly.</li>
      <li>regardless, I&#x27;m not mad about it, I think most people buy these as costume/novelty items</li>
      <li>Worth the price :)</li>

      <li>These combs are super kool.</li>
      <li>I tore out the comb part, used the box it came in to cut out a switchblade shape, covered it in foil, and super glued it in the comb&#x27;s place.</li>
      <li>Cheap and a funny gift.</li>
      <li>these are definitely pretty cheap, but I can&#x27;t fault them for it, since I don&#x27;t think anyone is pretending otherwise.</li>
      <li>I like these because there fun to play with and also its cool because then you can comb your hair in style.</li>
      <li>The comb itself is made of plastic, but as long as this product is treated with care, I believe it to be fairly sturdy.</li>

      <li>But other than that, it is a good comb</li>
      <li>part of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Since these were purchased to be used as props, and to prevent problems if one should break right before a show, I ordered two more.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Moreover, it&#x27;s actually a pretty handy comb that actually works.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect these to last even a week each, cheap but worth the price, breaks really easily</li>
      <li>but surprisingly did not break as fast as expected</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For only $2 each really not bad, if u have a big beard forget using this what so ever.</li>
    <li> Cute way to get the grandsons to comb their hair!</li>
    <li> Amazing fun and good to threaten people with</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use as props for the play, Twelve Angry Men.  These look great, and have a good spring action to the &amp;#34;switch&amp;#34; part of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Since these were purchased to be used as props, and to prevent problems if one should break right before a show, I ordered two more.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for my boyfriends beard!! Our little Chihuahua Louie loves getting combed with it too!! :)</li>
    <li> Very nifty combs, my boyfriend loved them. They are fairly hefty but I would not suggest them for every day use.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected it to be. Arrived on time too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my college son he loved them.</li>
    <li> It is a bit cheap but great as a novelty toy (why I got it) so worth the money</li>
    <li> showed up after 3 months. so flimsy I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these as anything but a prop.</li>
    <li> You get 2!  Both come in their own packaging, so you can give separately!  My son mentioned something about getting one of these combs and I found it!!!  The lock to keep the comb closed is not the greatest quality, but for the price--it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> Everyone of my friends think the comb is super cool.</li>
    <li> Plastic, and break easily, wasn&#x27;t amused</li>
    <li> It feels like plastic.</li>
    <li> These devices are fine, they are spring loaded and they do exactly what you expect.  The comb pops out like a switchblade knife.  The first one stopped working within a few days.  I bought a two pack so we moved to the second one and it was the same story.  It was fun while it lasted and it is very inexpensive but don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
    <li> These were very fun while they lasted, but the metal was very cheap so they broke in about less than a week.  At least they weren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
    <li> This is just what my grandson wanted for his birthday and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> These are so fun! Not thick comb and a bit flimsy, but for the price they are great! Husband loved them!</li>
    <li> Got this for my son.  He has really enjoyed having it.</li>
    <li> Purchased two of these. My husband loves to comb his beard with it. great price too.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my son, he likes them and seem to work fine on his hair</li>
    <li> The product is a little flimsy but that&#x27;s OK. It does its job. The switchblade mechanism actually works really well, surprisingly. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Oh and shipping was SUPER quick. I came in 3 days!!</li>
    <li> My son wanted these combs and was very happy with them. He had found some other combs like these on another site, but they were mostly plastic and cost more. Glad we checked Amazon before we made the purchase.</li>
    <li> It is a really nice comb but the only problem is that the locking mechanism is complete crap!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If u turn the comb upside down the lock will just run down. But other than that, it is a good comb</li>
    <li> Its a good product to buy if you are into old novelty things. I don&#x27;t use it so much, I just like to admire it and make my friends freak out and making them think I have a real switch blade.</li>
    <li> Its kinda shaky and cheap but nothing unexpected for the price. It gets achieves its purpose just fine though.</li>
    <li> This is a set of two \\&quot;switchblade\\&quot; combs. All in all, a pretty fun buy! I love toys and especially novelty items like this.The star loss was due to the \\&quot;lock\\&quot; mechanism. It works but immediately the lock does not hold up unless you hold the comb flat, which is pretty pointless (the LOCK is completely loose and doesn&#x27;t stay in place if you hold the comb straight vertical).    Conclusion: be glad this is a set of two because one will give out REALLY quickly. The quality is terrible and it feels like it&#x27;s about to break, but it really is a fun toy. The heaviness of it also makes it feel more metal-authentic. I&#x27;m not disappointed with it or anything because I expected this to be toy quality and nothing more.    Tip: Don&#x27;t use this out in public near any authority figures, please, kids. You&#x27;re just asking to be shot down by the police or dealt with in some other way.</li>
    <li> These combs are super kool. I like to take them to Sea World, and comb the seals hair with them. 10/10, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT STAINLESS STEEL.&lt;br /&gt;they can all dangly, plastic, and not worth the money AT ALL.</li>
    <li> I received it broken and the bag was too small which the combs came in. The boxes they came in were torn. The combs itself were already scratched. Never again.</li>
    <li> Funny little toy that works just like a switchblade.  Kids love them.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Thanks</li>
    <li> These things are awesome and cheap and you get two!!! It&#x27;s so funny to watch how people react when I start to take this out of my pocket and start to pull it out on them. It&#x27;s a good joke at work but be careful where you do it or else you might get shot. My advice is to not do it on strangers. Moreover, it&#x27;s actually a pretty handy comb that actually works.</li>
    <li> Item was shipped in a timely fashion and arrived in tact. No extra surprises. Given as gift, and the person enjoys the gift everytime I see him.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a toy of course but it works well when you need it too!</li>
    <li> Pretty cheap quality but still fun</li>
    <li> very cool, I remember those</li>
    <li> A little more cheaply constructed than I was expecting, but loads of fun and though the teeth are a bit fine and shallow, they&#x27;re not plagued by sharp plastic leftover from the molding process. Great gift idea, or cheap, fun pocket comb option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t take it to school, for obvious reasons.</li>
    <li> Great item at a low price.</li>
    <li> It was cheap and it looks cool but it doesn&#x27;t function well as a comb with such teeth.</li>
    <li> Cheap and a funny gift. Still hasn&#x27;t broken but I try not to overuse it. Great gift for a greaser.</li>
    <li> Super fun for little boys with cool tough new haircuts...</li>
    <li> One of them broke very easily.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect these to last even a week each, cheap but worth the price, breaks really easily</li>
    <li> Very awasom buy. its all metal just liked I had hoped but the comb part is plastic but that&#x27;s fine with me and Amazon handled is and shipped it to me fast I got it fast</li>
    <li> Great product. Very fun and funny. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; Is that it is lighter than I thought it would be (weight wise).</li>
    <li> You can only use them a couple of times before they stop opening and closing...But they look super awesome and they arrive fast and with some fake cash. The senders make it cute and nice. Worth the price :)</li>
    <li> Flimsy peaces of s*** but surprisingly did not break as fast as expected</li>
    <li> Good novelty item, but if you keep playing with the button it will eventually get stuck open. Also, The prongs in the comb are too close together in my opinion they could have made them further apart. But you get what you pay for, and this is a good buy!</li>
    <li> these are definitely pretty cheap, but I can&#x27;t fault them for it, since I don&#x27;t think anyone is pretending otherwise. (that&#x27;s kinda why I bought them.) as a comb, it&#x27;s pretty awful. I tried just to see (I have very long thin hair), but the comb is so short it&#x27;s basically useless. regardless, I&#x27;m not mad about it, I think most people buy these as costume/novelty items so I think the appearance is more relevant than how well it functions as a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;personally, I bought these to make into a ridiculously cheap prop switchblade, and for that it&#x27;s worked great. I tore out the comb part, used the box it came in to cut out a switchblade shape, covered it in foil, and super glued it in the comb&#x27;s place. it opens and closes exactly as it should, and it actually looks a lot more realistic than I thought it would. I&#x27;m sure someone with more talent and patience could do something really fantastic with it. as for the spare one I now have, I think my 12 year old cousin would get a kick out of it, so I&#x27;m gonna give it to her.</li>
    <li> These combs feel nice and heavy in the box. After you take them out, the box basically tells you what you need to know. Not sure if its stainless steel or just aluminum but, great product!</li>
    <li> These look nice. My nephews will love them</li>
    <li> They are very cheaply priced, and indeed cheaply made. The locking mechanism doesn&#x27;t stay in place it&#x27;s flimsy, the paint scratched very easily and the comb is starting to bend after very little amount of uses. It actually surprisingly isn&#x27;t that bad at coming your hair though, and trust me you won&#x27;t fool anyone into thinking it&#x27;s real lol</li>
    <li> Nifty novelty comb looks like a real switchblade</li>
    <li> Product was exactly how pictured,  and exactly how I remember it when it was when I was a kid, shipping was on decent time will do business with them again</li>
    <li> Cool think to just open and close. I have no problems with it so far.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected</li>
    <li> 5/5 stars from me. I like these because there fun to play with and also its cool because then you can comb your hair in style. If you by this item from &amp;#34;Set of 2 Stainless Steel Switchblade Comb&amp;#34; then you get 2 of them for 1 quantity just to let you know. Its worth the price.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for they work fine kinda of cheap made</li>
    <li> Easy to Carry &amp; fine blades great</li>
    <li> They are cheap party favors</li>
    <li> I loved it greats work looks like plastic, but it&#x27;s pretty durable and there two which is great 2 for the price of one</li>
    <li> According to my boyfriend &amp;#34;a little tin-ish and plasticy. Construction speaks to the novelty part of the description. But has held up nicely in my pocket and wards off evil doers&amp;#34; I say &amp;#34;his mustache has never looked neater&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> its was not stainless steel and snapped when i opened it DO NOT BUY THIS S***TY ITEM</li>
    <li> The product you get for such a low price Is well worth it. These combs are more durable than you&#x27;d expect for the cost, although the locking mechanism doesn&#x27;t work very well. When slid up towards the release button, it locks the button from pressing. However, the locking mechanism tends to slide freely, so it is not very reliable. The comb itself is made of plastic, but as long as this product is treated with care, I believe it to be fairly sturdy. When ordering this product, I asked for it to be shipped asap in order to get it in time for a Halloween costume and was very pleased that the package was shipped out as soon as it could be. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  These are being used as props, not actual combs.  The teeth are rather short to do any real combing, but these are fun for show.</li>
    <li> My son had to have these combs!  They very much look like a switch blade, but really it&#x27;s a comb!  Fun, novel item.</li>
    <li> Its exactly what is is. But its very cheap feeling. The idea of it is nice but not worth buying.</li>
    <li> Worth the price. :) Cute gift idea.</li>
    <li> Super cool lil knick knacks!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping.  Awesome combs.</li>
    <li> I bought these combs for a 50s themed party to compliment my greaser costume. I should have bought more than two, as several people wanted one to use for their costumes and for pictures.</li>
    <li> The release was slow and stuck sometimes. Looked cool. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Works great but little cheaply made, but for the price I guess it&#x27;s worth it. Button gets pushed by accident if u carry in pocket so have to be careful not to tear up the comb if it gets pushed open. My son fixed the button to where it didn&#x27;t pop open in pocket and still uses it</li>
    <li> Great size.  Fits in pocket or purse.  Comb is protected when folded.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son, but quality is cheap.</li>
    <li> Its cheaply made.. But the lady&#x27;s can&#x27;t resist you when they see how cool you are after you flick this bad boy out.</li>
    <li> These are great, I carry theme everywhere and I love the shock value when I pull them out.</li>
    <li> Purchased the switch blade combs for someone and they were exactly what they wanted.  They were very happy with the product and the quick delivery.</li>
