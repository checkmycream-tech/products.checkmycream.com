<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this cream makes it so soft and smooth. Love it.</li>
    <li> I discovered this cream at a special dermatology spa in my area when I was going through chemotherapy treatments and experiencing skin issues as my skin normally tends towards dryness. This is the gentlest, most hydrating and safe cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for six years, always at night, and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop.</li>
    <li> An excellent moisturizer! Leaves skin supple, feeling and looking great!</li>
    <li> Good ,fast service.  Good seller would buy again</li>
    <li> The best moisture cream I have ever used and believe me I have tried them all. I have used this product for over fifteen years, never a breakout never dry.</li>
    <li> Vivite has become part of my daughter&#x27;s daily regime, and she has gorgeous skin! She had a facial on vacation in HI about two years ago and experienced this fabulous cream, she&#x27;s not stopped using it since! Although our dermatologist carries this, he can &#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price! ♥</li>
    <li> Vivite, The best product on the market.. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 years now, and it has truly improved to a very large and noticeable degree the look and feel of my skin. It&#x27;s not a product that you can buy at a department store like Macy&#x27;s for example, and I have been purchasing it through my doctors office at such an insane cost, but I continued to buy it despite the cost because it truly did what it said it was supposed to do~&gt; unlike many other pricy products out there. As you can imagine I was overjoyed to find vivite here (by chance I might add while researching about the type of peptides in the products) and at less than half the price of the doctors office cost. I highly recommend this product for its treatment and moisturizing benifits.. Nothing compares 😊</li>
    <li> I love this product , it helps with dry skin</li>
    <li> Vivite is a great product.  Love the way it feels on my face.  And it&#x27;s amazing how such a little bit goes such a long way.  Amazon&#x27;s cost is much less than my Dr&#x27;s office charges.</li>
    <li> great service, great product, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I just got my vivite cream. I&#x27;ve used it before, but this feels different: it feels more like cetaphil or CeraVe. It also has some small black particles in the bottle. I&#x27;ve read about someone else&#x27; review but thought it couldn&#x27;t be true. Now I know she was right: the product is fake.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at great price and speedy delivery!!</li>
    <li> Effective and well priced.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful! I have used for years and have never had any issues using on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> the best cream I have ever used.  Can be used with your sunscreen, I mix the two together, or by itself.  I have extremely dry skin and this sinks right in.  Love it.  Use it in the daytime and at night.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It&#x27;s not greasy and gets the job done.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 years.  My face is SO soft!!</li>
    <li> After months of suffering with a dry, peeling, red face from using a retin-A product I was put on a maintenance program using Vivite Replenish Hydrating cream. Used at night, the cream is fantastic. Smooths on easily and leaves my face so soft. No more dry peeling skin (I&#x27;m still on retin-A too). Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist first recommended this product and I originally paid a lot more for it before I found it on Amazon.com. This item is not greasy at all, not gooey, it goes on smoothly and hydrates my skin without any shine or gooey feeling. I love using this product right before an evening out with friends. I use it every evening after a shower and it works great.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s the best thing for people with sensitive, combination skin.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT...HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I Love this Replenish Hydrating Cream. I have my face chemically peeled every 6 months to just keep my skin fresh. But the week following the peel my skin is very red, irritated &amp; dry. Not to mention it starts to peel. Well for this reason alone I  needed a hydrating cream (considering the one the doctors office gives you is not enough to do any thing with). I also battle the occasional dry skin. This does the trick for both things. This cream is NOT greasy or sticky. It goes on so smooth yet is thick enough to moisturize. And you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot. I would recommend this to anyone, considering it is safe for sensitive skin. If I can use it the day following a chemical peel, I think that says a lot about this cream.</li>
    <li> It has been well over a week since ordering the product and the product according to Amazon, still has not shipped.  Actually Amazon wrote to me and said that they can&#x27;t get the seller to respond.  I have ordered from them before and did not have this problem, however as noted in one of the other reviews, I did notice a difference in the smell of the product compared to ones I&#x27;ve ordered from a different seller.  I also should have been more aware before ordering from this seller Abzoo.  Never again!  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This product as well as the night cream and eye cream you can tell was repackaged.  They were all in the origininal package and boxes.  I have used all of the products before and know the creams.  They were different and even had a different smell.  The night cream actually had hair and black specks of some sort in the cream!!!!  Please stay away from this seller and pay a little more from one of the other sellers.  I chose this one because it was the cheapest!!!!  My fault, you get what you pay for!!!</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by my dermatologist.  Great stuff that&#x27;s not greasy and a great moisturizer for the face.  My face doesn&#x27;t break out from it.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer and it was at a decent price. If you are familiar with this brand then you will know it is on the higher end.  Shipping took alittle longer than expected.</li>
    <li> I paid $50 for a bottle at the spa.  Buying it online was way less expensive for the same product.  I found no difference.  Is the product earth-shattering wonderful?  I dunno, but it is good, but I put other stuff on top of it because my skin is very dry, ie Eucerin Q10 and jar with alpha hydroxyl -- super hydrating.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and realized too late that all Vivite products have been TESTED ON ANIMALS in their laboratories. Shame on cosmetic companies that still practice this.</li>
    <li> Okay, now I&#x27;m really disappointed.  This product is a fake.  The first two times I bought this cream it had a lovely creamy consistency and a pleasant perfumey odor.  Then I ordered it a third time it was waxy and cheap looking and smelling.  Being a believer in human goodness, I ordered it again, thinking it might have been an unusual event.  The new one just arrived and it two has a cheap texture and smell.  If you could get the real product I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  For the counterfeit, which this is, stay away.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with Vivite Replenish Hydrating Cream.  Not greasy, long lasting moisture.  Would recommend.   Price on Amazon was far less than elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have used Vivite and this cream feels and smells different. It obviously doesn&#x27;t provide results either. It was packaged like new. I purchased this because it was the cheapest.</li>
    <li> I have used this mosturizer for years, since it was recommended by my dermatologist. It is thin, non greasy, and easy to put on.  After about a week, I find that it decreases my blochiness, redness, and my face just looks better. I will continue to use it all winter.</li>
    <li> I am almost 50 and have always had very dry skin. This is the best cream I have ever used. It is not greasy. Does not burn my eyes or cause any redness. Over the years, I have spent a lot of money and time trying out all the different brands. This one by far is the BEST I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The box and jar looked the same, but the cream is not the same as what I had used before (and I had the old jar, so I know I ordered the same product).  I don&#x27;t know if the reduction in thickness is the fault of the vendor or whether Allergan changed the formula.  It&#x27;s still a very good cream.</li>
    <li> Vivite Replenish Hydrating Cream works good on my skin.  My chin was dry and red and after a week or so of using Vivite, the redness and dryness cleared away.  I&#x27;m so thankful.</li>
    <li> moisturizes and smoothes skin with small amounts of product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  FAST SHIPPING!!  Wonderful fulfillment.  You have a customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a good companion to the Vivite Night Creme.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much that I&#x27;m willing to pay for shipping just to get it!  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I have this whole line and it does not make me break out, but still moisturizes. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my derm.  I originally purchased it from their office for twice what I pay on line.  It goes on light and there is no scent.  It has been my go to cream for 3 years now!</li>
    <li> Best moisture, no clogged pores. My Derm recommends!&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin and this does not clog and feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way so you get your money&#x27;s worth. Works especially well during the winter months but it isn&#x27;t too heavy so you can definitely use it year-round.</li>
    <li> this stuff is fantastic, will not break out sensitive skin, and hydrates very well. I continue to buy when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have used MD Forté products for years. I was so disappointed that the line got discontinued and replaced with Vivite. This moisturizer did moisturize my skin and it also broke me out. There is no comparison to MD Forté Facial Cream. Not even close!  Every Vivite product I have used has caused my skin more problems than good. I can&#x27;t believe Allergan would drop MD Forté, which has a cult following, for this junk. Highly disappointing</li>
    <li> Just recently tried the product and seems great.  Not too greasy and rubs in quickly.  This product replaces a discontinued product used in the past and seems to work as well or better.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful!!  Try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I use on my face and neck areas and have seen improvements in just a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I have aging skin with acne.  This is the ONLY moisturizer I have found to tame my dry skin from all the meds I use to treat my acne.  It does not clog my pores, and it sells on Amazon for $20 less than at my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist and it&#x27;s great for skin with rosacea because it lacks so many of the ingredients that irritate delicate skin.</li>
    <li> If I could give no stars, I would.  The box was obviously opened, contained no product insert, and took no effort to open the jar (hence, not new!).  Suspect it was filled with something other than Vivite Replenish Hydrating Cream because it smelled different, and it wasn&#x27;t even full.  Do not order from this seller!  Fraudulent!  Product is being returned.  No way I&#x27;m sticking mystery cream on my face.</li>
    <li> Vivite Replenish Hydrating Cream is GREAT for sensitive skin which I have.  It helps eliminate wrinkles, especially on my cheeks and on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can continue to get it.</li>
    <li> Great for my super dry, sensitive skin - not seeing any visible improvement of skin, but will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product line. When I ordered in the past I was quite happy with the results. This particular time I noticed a different consistency and also a different smell. Hmmmmm, I never bothered using it as I knew it would not be performing like my past order. Read between the lines</li>
    <li> This light and gentle facial creme is great for my sensitive skin year round. My dermatologist recommended this product for me several years ago. I am happy to find this on Amazon at a better price!</li>
    <li> love love love these products.  I now use the complete system and I&#x27;m actually saving money compared to the cost of my acne medications.</li>
    <li> i love this cream, especially for dry skin, i would purchase again used along with the night cream, it was a reasonable price</li>
    <li> I use this with Revision intellashade broad spectrum 45 because of past skin cancer, i use it for better coverage during the day.  And it last longer.  U only have to use a pea size amount on back of hand and mix then apply all over face.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I have used it for years.  I will buy it again and again.  Great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Vivite&#x27; for several years and love it. For years every moisturizing  or hydrating cream I tried made my complexion too oily. Vivite&#x27; was used during my facials and finally I found  one I could use with no problems! I am over 69 years old and I get compliments on my complexion very often and people want to know what I use that keeps my face so nice and smooth. I happily tell them about Vivite&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Very rich and it hydrates my face just perfect.  Never leaves a residue.</li>
    <li> I love vivite product and this one is excellent.  You cannot go wrong and it is a great price here</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Vivete to me a few years ago.  I love it and am sorry its no longer being made.</li>
    <li> Best daily moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> this is what my derm recommends and I love it!  Not cheap but at 50+ years old, I&#x27;ll gladly pay.</li>
    <li> After hitting my mid 30&#x27;s I had tried every single expensive lotion, potion, cream de&#x27; la&#x27; creme and FINALLY found one that I LOVE. Was recommended to me by my Plastic Surgeon as I have very sensitive dry/sometimes oily skin. I was not expecting to find anything great about Vivite replenish hydrating cream, but after my first week using it I was hooked!!! Not only was I using this on my face, around my eyes, but I decided to use it on my hands (LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!) unexpected results &#x3D;) This is a cream, and I was worried that it would be to heavy, too greasy, however I was so surprised to find it was absolutely the perfect match for me, it did not clog my pores, it was not heavy, not greasy just perfecto! I&#x27;d not suggest this for younger women in their late teens, early 20&#x27;s as I think it may be a bit much (when I was that age my face was quite oily and I know it would have been too much) my daughter is 17 and she could not use this particular cream twice a day, but CAN use it for those occasional times when her face becomes to dry and slightly flaky from using her Acne topical medication. Recently after having purchased my 3rd bottle of this cream from my DR&#x27;s office I had run out and they ALSO ran out, I was in a panic as I cannot use anything else but this. DR&#x27;s office said they would not have the Vivite for another week, so I went ahead and very carefully checked out AMAZON&#x27;s selection. I did purchase from Amazon as it was being sent direct from AMAZON (PRIME) rather than through another vendor which made me feel a bit more reassured that I&#x27;d actually be receiving the real deal. It cost $27 which was significantly less expensive than my DR&#x27;s office. I received my package in less than 48hrs, inspected it, checked the lot # and the container and even compared the little I had left in my nearly empty bottle. The cream seemed exactly the same, the actual packaging was only slightly different, but I inspected every square inch...I&#x27;m not sure why the packaging was slightly different, but it does seem the cream is identical and the real deal! Great PURCHASE saving a bit as compared to buying at the Dr&#x27;s. I know some people have complained about the smell of this cream, I happen to like it as it really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, and it lasts all day on my skin leaving my face nice and moisturized &#x3D;) Like I said I&#x27;d never have purchased this in my late teens, or my 20&#x27;s...It&#x27;s only been since mid 30&#x27;s that my face has become dry.</li>
    <li> Although this is the first time i am using this product, it does a good job of hydrating my skin.  However it can be a little sticky at times. Not sure why but its keeping my face from drying out.  I got the order quickly and will order more products from this person in the future.</li>
    <li> Contains licorice and green tea, both of which are helpful for my rosacea/sensitive skin.  Very moisturizing, it really quenches the skin.  It&#x27;s rich, so if you have oily skin it may clog your pores.  Sometimes it&#x27;s too rich for me to use during the hot summer months.</li>
    <li> LOVE these products, recommended by a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office...no more problems with dry skin. Adds firmness to complexion. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for over 5 years.  It is a wonderful way to keep skin refreshed.  I always welcome the on-line savings.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for sensitive skin. Plus it is just way cheaper to buy at Amazon then the Dr.&#x27;s office. Overall, pleased and price and ease of getting the product I need.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  I&#x27;m 63 yrs old.  For so many years I tried to find a product that worked without my skin breaking out.  This product was recommended by a owner of a spa several years ago as my skin was very dry.  It tried it on my sensitive skin and it felt wonderful and did not irritate my skin.  At my age, believe me, I have tried so many products and this one I will stick with for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I like all products from vivite</li>
    <li> The goes on creamy and protects my skin all day without being oily.  No too shinny skin with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and I will continue to until I find something better.  I use a sunscreen with tint over.</li>
    <li> If you have really dry skin this product is a must. I use it on my face, neck, chest for several years now.  It keeps my neck from looking like chicken skin.</li>
    <li> I was sold this as part of a package of products to use after a facial procedure.  This was the only one of the Vivite products that actually worked.  It is a fantaastic moisturizer and works as well as products that cost much more.</li>
    <li> Have just gotten cream. First day I tried it. Am excited for results. Blended well and moisturizes well! Will have to see. Time will tell... dilv ed rly came in a few days!</li>
    <li> It is the greatest cream .I have beenusing it for 2 years now but the only issue is that the price has gotten so high now that i can only buy one vivite product each month</li>
    <li> Very light on the skin.  Skin seems to be very hydrated.  My hair dresser asked what I used on my face because my skin seemed so young for my age.  It was shortly after I started using Vivite.</li>
    <li> As a senior citizen of 60 plus, this is the perfect product to keep your skin hydrated as well as clearing up those pesky little discolorations of the face. I would highly recommend this product for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this cream.  The cream itself is wonderful.  I have been using it for two years and almost exclusively buying through Amazon with no problem.  BUT, I am just writing this review so that buyers do not purchase this product from &amp;#34;Express Health&amp;#34;.  When I received the package today - I could see immediately that it repackaged in some strange plastic.  Then I opened the jar of cream and could see that SOMEONE ELSE&#x27;S FINGERS HAD BEEN IN THERE!  IT WAS PARTIALLY USED!  So incredibly gross and un-hygenic!  I give much credit to Amazon though because they refunded my money immediately and were going to contact that seller.  I am now online trying to find a different seller - who has reliable reviews selling this cream - to once again buy it.  The stuff that was sent today is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> I really like this hydrating cream.  Ive tried others and slammed them on here, but this one was recommended by my dermatologist, and I know why.  Non-oily feel and hydrating effect, I would absolutely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> I started using this cream about 2 years ago when my Dermatologist recommended it to me. I have very dry and sensitive skin, and i had tried over the counter products such a Aveeno, Ambi, and Cedaphil. the products either burned my face or didnt hydrate my face  properly. When i started using this product i noticed a difference in my face. My face felt smoother and this product is non irritating. I use their whole line of products and so far no complaints.. i would definately recommend this cream and thier hydrating facial cleanser for anyone with dry skin...IT WORKS..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to call Allergan and beg them to bring back MD Forte replenish cream!! Vivite has supposedly replaced the old md forte, but it is just not the same. The md forte was hands down the best moisturizer I have ever used-- it literally saved my skin! This &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; version looks and feels the same initially, but just isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> I have been a consistent user for the past three years.  My face is smooth, no lines or wringles, and no sagging!</li>
    <li> You want to buy this.  It goes on evenly and stays.  I had dry patches and now I don&#x27;t .  I am on my second order.&lt;br /&gt;I is really good for old dry skin.  I am over 60 and am happy to have found this which was recommended by a dermotalogist office.  This is considerable lower in price than I found at the doctors office.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for almost 2 years and I don&#x27;t see any results</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get that item yet or not even money back. Give me my money back or send me that item.</li>
    <li> A fantastic moisturizer as recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream and the firming cream from the same seller. The firming cream came in the box that I&#x27;m used to seeing vivite products in. The hydrating cream however, came in a white and dark purple box. I don&#x27;t know if vivite has new packaging since I bought a facial cleanser from another seller and the cleanser smells and feels the same as the ones I&#x27;ve used before, but this one also came in the while&amp;dark purple box. The hydrating cream seems repackaged to me: its more liquid than the one I&#x27;m used to and kinda had a dip in the middle. The smell seems to be the same but I am doubtful, this cream seemed to feel more like CeraVe or something. Vivite is great product line and expensive at dermatologist&#x27;s office or spas but be careful when ordering online...I&#x27;ve ordered the same thing a year ago and it was fine but since then seems like some people have been selling repackaged items, putting them in new boxes.</li>
    <li> bought on dr. recommendation.  it is a great hydrator and is reasonable priced and easy to use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Cured my dry skin and took me a long time to find something that worked. First time I ordered it on-line and from Payless Beauty. Quality not at all the same as my previous purchases. Will return.</li>
    <li> Great product ... I have used this for years .. Makes your face buttery soft !!!</li>
    <li> Great lightweight product for daily use.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a damaged box with red particles inside the lid and immersed in cream.  Otherwise, it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance, and it feels so light and refreshing on my face. I can feel my skin hydrating whenever I apply it, and a little goes a long way. What I don&#x27;t love is the $60 price tag at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, so I am very happy to be able to buy it for much less online. I read all the reviews about fake product being sold, and was definitely wary about ordering. I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now (once from Beauty-Stop and once from Brand Names for Less) and each time it is been the real stuff, so hopefully the fake stuff was just from one seller in the past and the current sellers are honest.</li>
    <li> Vivite was recommended by my dermatologist. It&#x27;s an excellent hydrating cream to use in addition to your nightly moisturizer--especially in the winter when the air is dry. It is soothing and non-greasy. Also, it is far less expensive to order through Amazon than buying at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Best product ever!!!!</li>
    <li> I live in Colorado where it is very dry, and this product does the trick.  Just need to put on sunscreen too!</li>
    <li> This works great if you have sensitive or dry skin.  It&#x27;s especially nice in the winter or after facial procedures.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great face lotion. I use it in combo with Obagi products and Retin A for when my skin gets dry. Has a great texture, not oily or anything.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my second jar of vivite and was disappointed again. It was billed as being a new formulation of MD Forte I skin cream but was not as satisfactory. It is thinner and less effective. I hope that they bring back the original formula.</li>
    <li> Great product for those that have very dry skin. It hydrates better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
    <li> This cream is great. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and it leaves my face really soft, smooth and hydrated. I have very oily skin and I like this because it does not cause excess oil.</li>
    <li> Product as described b</li>
    <li> I used to love this stuff. Great price, worked on a break out and lasted forever. But then I ordered it again, as my other one finally ran out, and to my disappointment, the formulation seemed different. Worse yet, it made my skin break out.  Really miss the old stuff!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, especially for post procedures such as a fraxel peel.. I use this at night only, as it is extremely moisturizing (and I have oily skin to begin with ) I love the vivite line and have tried the scrub, night cream, eye cream, and chemical peel. Only product I did not like was the day SPF cream.</li>
    <li> If I had to give up every single beauty product but one, this would be my keeper.  It truly penetrates and hydrates rather than just floating on top of the skin. Its a game changer!</li>
    <li> My favorite face cream no scent</li>
    <li> Love this product but it has recently been discontinued by Allergan. Be aware if purchasing after December 2014 the product may have been on the shelf a long time; no expiration date was visible on the product I received.</li>
    <li> I will be fair to the product and gave it four stars for its purpose of hydration. After my night facial scrub, in my morning my skin is very soft and hydrated. Like a baby bottom soft. After a week of use I started to notice blemishes developing on my face but wrote it off as food, weather or hormone related. Hitting into the second week I noticed a pattern of acne developing when I use this products. I stopped using it and switched to cevive. After three days my acne and blemishes were gone! Mind you I was using on a dab on my entire face. A tiny bit goes a long way with Vivite since it spreads on the face easily. There is no strong odor, to be honest, barely any odor comes from this product which is nice in my case. To wrap up, I gave four stars since it did what it said to do but everyone skin is different and mine just clogged up with this one &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Fast and efficient. Product new and in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> good quality, will order again!</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, this will really make your face feel hydrated.  It is a heavy cream but absorbs well.  I put it on after my sunscreen.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This Vivie product is awesome for people with oily skin but need a good moisturizer at times  especially at night.</li>
    <li> Moisturizers well but still light. My face has not broken out, that has always been the downfall for any moisturizer I ise. Not this one!! Yay!!</li>
    <li> Excellent skin moisturizer which is actually a cross between a gel and a cream. It is NOT oily and is a wonderful, non-irritating moisturizer to use in conjunction with home micro-dermabrasion, retinoids, or dry sensitive skin (I fit all of those categories). No perfumes. It has never made my face break out. I&#x27;ve used this product for ten years. If you were a former user of the MD Forte product, this is the same thing with a name change.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and loved it but this jar, of whatever it is, makes my face break out in big red cysts. NOT at all OK!!&lt;br /&gt;I have read quite a few reviews about phony products being sold and this seems to be another one. Who can tell what garbage is inside this cream that should make my skin sick. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> great product have been using for years.</li>
    <li> I love VIVITE Replenish Hydrating Cream.  I originally purchased it for about $55 at a spa.  I wanted to continue using it but did not want to pay so much for it.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful with the products that I use.  It has terrific results.</li>
    <li> My facial skin is sensitive but it loves this cream. Ordered it several times in the last and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Have done the La Prairie.Le Mer etc costs-a-fortune route, but this was dermatologist recommended (by two doctors I see) and I start and end every day with it.  Really hydrates and is very gentle.  I have great skin and I&#x27;m counting on this to keep it that way as long as possible.  And at a tiny fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Hydrates and moisturizes without leaving a greasy film or causing skin eruptions.  I love it!</li>
    <li> this stuff has different consistancey, bad odor, oily, plus its all over the lid. Doesn&#x27;t look new.  Iam very disappointed.  Requesting a full refund.</li>
    <li> I use this often works well on my acne</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing without being heavy - My skin used to be on the dry side but now its great since using Vivite - the whole line is fantasic</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it worked for my needs. I am happy with the price and it is a lot cheaper than the salon that recommended it.</li>
    <li> My Derm recommended this about a year ago for $50 a bottle.  Found on Amazon for less and am still in love with it.  Now that we are moving into Spring, I use this at night and wake with smooth skin.  Love the way my skin looks and feels with Vivite; I&#x27;m one my 5th bottle - use on hands and chest too.</li>
    <li> i am required to use this for my skin by my dermotologist and she jacks up her prices, but this price is excellent! ive had this for about three months and its still going strong! this is the perfect amount and keeps my face uber moisturized!</li>
    <li> Great the product meet mu expectations at a great saving value.  Thanks Amazon !</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this nighttime cream and it has worked very well for me.  I highly recommend this product for people with dry and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist sold me my first jar; I liked it so well i came back for more -- through Amazon which offers a much better price.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer been using it for two years never makes my skin oily love it</li>
    <li> This was a good quality moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I needed something a bit more intense for&lt;br /&gt;my skin as it is very dry</li>
    <li> very moisturizing without being too heavy . great price for a great product . same type of product at origins or Dominique would be at least $40</li>
    <li> I was paying $55 at my dermatologist office but just could not use another cream on my face.  Therefore, i was so happy to find it so much cheaper because no other facial products compare to vivite.</li>
    <li> It is thick and goes on lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;Not my usual experience with vivite products.&lt;br /&gt;Would not reorder this product.&lt;br /&gt;Am wondering if maybe this one was out of date.</li>
    <li> Very heavy, thick covering for lots of moisturizing. You can&#x27;t put make up over this or anything. It&#x27;s for night use, going to bed like time. But it works. My doctor just told me I have nice skin and I haven&#x27;t seen her in years before this. I have had very bad Rosacea now and in time&#x27;s past, and this is great for calming the redness and irritation of Rosacea. Vivite is the new name for the same product MD Forte.</li>
    <li> I previously used MD Forte, but the makers of MD Forte replaced that line with the Vivite line of products.  I cannot tell much, if any, of a difference.  However, if there is any, the Vivite seems to be an even better moisturizer.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Great product-is perfect in every way.  It really replenishes moisture and makes my shin so soft.  Won&#x27;t be without it!  Non-greasy!</li>
