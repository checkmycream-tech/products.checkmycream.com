### Positive Reviews

      <li>best price.  </li>
      <li>The best product for thinning hair!</li>
      <li>very good shampoo</li>
      <li>...but my hair does feel great when i continue to use this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
      <li>it is very nice, and keep the hair shinne.</li>
      <li>good quality,</li>
      <li>It seems too good to be true, but then, the pamphlet that came with it did say that cost isn&#x27;t a factor in their ingredient selection.  </li>
      <li>instead I feel my hair are more thinner now.</li>
      <li>one more thing.</li>
      <li>I believe if I was still using it I would lose even more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will purchase this shampoo one more time and make a decision whether to use it if my hair does not show some results of hair growth.</li>
      <li>this seemed like a good price for a good product, and was definitely cheaper than more prohibitive prices I&#x27;d seen elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I can not give an accurate review at this time</li>
      <li>At this price, I think it&#x27;s important to note what I&#x27;m saying:&lt;br /&gt;existing hair growth &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Also they have upgraded the bottle so they don&#x27;t leak as much, which is nice not to have orange goo</li>
      <li>this is a good shampoo, it is cream and soft, and the aroma</li>
      <li>No noticeable help to my hair with regard to some mild hair loss.</li>
      <li>but I got it really quick after ordering.</li>
      <li>Have noticed that my hair has stopped falling out as quickly as it once did.  </li>
      <li>I am hopeful that more new hair will show up soon.</li>
      <li>The shampoo I was using prior to this was good, &amp;#34;Davines,&amp;#34; but after using this, I&#x27;m positive that my search is over and that this one will, in time, restore my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked this shampoo at first, because it made my hair look fuller and feel softer to touch, but after using it only 3 times, I lost SO MUCH HAIR that I had to give up on it.</li>
      <li>had lots of hopes on it but wont use it any more after current bottle finishes.</li>
      <li>Others have noticed more overall fullness</li>
      <li>/&gt;It really did some pretty damage.</li>
      <li>How much hair have you got to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really helps thicken the hair</li>
      <li>I really like the quality of my hair, but bought the product because I&#x27;ve been experiencing loss of hair.</li>
      <li>faster,&lt;br /&gt;existing hair &#x3D; coated for temporary thicker *appearance* and is very shiny&lt;br /&gt;hair shedding &#x3D; the same&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I heard (after buying) that we should only buy directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s web site to make sure we&#x27;re getting the real thing and not a knock-off.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price in the long run, but it could be worth a try for someone who has never used it.</li>
      <li>so far have been easy enough to commit to.</li>
      <li>Not a lot of lather, kinda hard to rinse out, but leaves a nice shine and very manageable mane.</li>
      <li>Does seem like a decent shampoo though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent shampoo.</li>
      <li>You have to use it continuously, but highly recommend for thickness and fullness</li>
      <li>This product was highly recommended...</li>
      <li>As a young-ish female with hair loss, this is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have success when I followed it with a regular sulfate-free conditioner, but when I use it by itself, it leaves my hair shiney and appearing thicker.  </li>
      <li>I used both in other products and everything were fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review once I&#x27;ve used the product for several months, but as of right now, this one is a winner.  </li>
      <li>Lathers really well and comes in a big bottle.  </li>
      <li>I did some research and the doctors are saying that the hair loss caused by this type of product is generally temporary, but it will take months to regrow your hair</li>
      <li>I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and topical treatment for about a month and so far I have seen some positives.</li>
      <li>The product label has a warning about possible excessive shedding in the first two weeks of using it, but the question is how much hair are you prepared to lose before you get that peach fuzz to replace it with?</li>
      <li>Revita has whole bunch of other stuff company who makes it don&#x27;t want to disclose.</li>
      <li>I have so much new growth and my hair returned to the normal fall out rate of a few strands when brushing my hair.</li>
      <li>The shampoo isn&#x27;t as harsh as other fragrance free shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Sound dumb, but I wash my head with product, leave in for 2 minutes, wash it out and use it again and leave in for about 5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Shampoo was too watery as if it has been diluted with water, and has much less lather than normal!</li>

<li> After using this only once, my hair was lighter, shinier, fuller, and I wasn&#x27;t shedding as I usually do.  </li>
<li> Pump does leak slightly.</li>
<li> can also say, my hair grows quickly now and used to be painfully slow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Have been using the product for a few months and don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;stimulates&amp;#34;</li>
<li> As soon as i go back to something mainstream, my hair begins to feel thin and limp...</li>
<li> Though this won&#x27;t keep you from going bald, it will slow the process down.  </li>
<li> Not sure if it works</li>
<li> Not sure what the results will be but am hopeful.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a 35 y.o. female who has been experiencing hair loss for 2 years, and I&#x27;ve tried every expensive product out there.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s weird because both revita and Nizoral (US version) have both 1% keto</li>
<li> time ago if someone asked me if shampoos like revita can make things worst, I would say no way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No noticeable help to my hair with regard to some mild hair loss. Does seem like a decent shampoo though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cons: Shampoo is part orange with some white in it. Pump does leak slightly.</li>
    <li> Works.  Really helps thicken the hair</li>
    <li> very good shampoo i suggest to bug it to every one that have problems with hair loss , is vey helpful</li>
    <li> I started using revita shampoo after there was Nizoral shortage. I  was  shedding tons of hair while using Revita shampoo for around 6 months with no sign of any hair coming back. I thought it was working, shedding  means treatment is working, but I realized that its taking waaay too long. I think I waited too long. I was giving revita chance to see if it eventually regrow some hair I lost while using it.&lt;br /&gt;It really did some pretty damage. I believe if I was still using it I would lose even more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So I stopped it and got Nizoral and start using Nizoral shampoo (1% keto) again as I used it before revita. After a month and a half I noticed my hair growing back. I think I will regrow everything now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long time ago if someone asked me if shampoos like revita can make things worst, I would say no way. But now after this experience I believe it can deffinetely make make things worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weird because both revita and Nizoral (US version) have both 1% keto but revita has other stuff like caffeine and copper peptides. I used both in other products and everything were fine. Revita has whole bunch of other stuff company who makes it don&#x27;t want to disclose. They don&#x27;t disclose the percentage of ketakonazole.</li>
    <li> Lathers really well and comes in a big bottle.  Not sure what the results will be but am hopeful.  f</li>
    <li> Skeptical at first, but it works at retention with continued use. healthier scalp after 2 weeks in my experience. Not a lot of lather, kinda hard to rinse out, but leaves a nice shine and very manageable mane. Discontinued use due to travel.</li>
    <li> ...but my hair does feel great when i continue to use this shampoo.  As soon as i go back to something mainstream, my hair begins to feel thin and limp...so guess i have to keep using DS!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s giving me the quality hair I used to have but I like the product. I heard (after buying) that we should only buy directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s web site to make sure we&#x27;re getting the real thing and not a knock-off. That concerned me b/c this seemed like a good price for a good product, and was definitely cheaper than more prohibitive prices I&#x27;d seen elsewhere. I&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo, conditioner and topical treatment for about a month and so far I have seen some positives. Others have noticed more overall fullness but I have not seen what I would call regrowth... yet. I can not give an accurate review at this time but I can say the products don&#x27;t have an obscure odor and so far have been easy enough to commit to.</li>
    <li> Using this shampoo along with the Spectrum DNC-N serum for hair regrowth.  Seems to be working well.  The shampoo isn&#x27;t as harsh as other fragrance free shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works but I got it really quick after ordering. Have been using the product for a few months and don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;stimulates&amp;#34; hair growth but it does appear to help in keeping it from falling out.</li>
    <li> this is a good shampoo, it is cream and soft, and the aroma it is very nice, and keep the hair shinne.</li>
    <li> best price.  good quality,</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel thicker and also gets rid of dandruff</li>
    <li> Product seems to be unauthentic. Shampoo was too watery as if it has been diluted with water, and has much less lather than normal!</li>
    <li> The best product for thinning hair! Several months after I had taken numerous medications for Pneumonia my hair began falling out in clumps. I could actually see my scalp. I spoke with hair stylists and others that had hair loss issues. This product was highly recommended...IT WORKS!!! I have so much new growth and my hair returned to the normal fall out rate of a few strands when brushing my hair. The price was one-forth of what I paid at the salon.</li>
    <li> You have to use it continuously, but highly recommend for thickness and fullness</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent shampoo. Haven&#x27;t noticed any hair loss help, but makes my hair grow faster. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the price in the long run, but it could be worth a try for someone who has never used it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo on the hopes that it would help with my shedding. It has not been noticeable yet but I hope to see long term results.</li>
    <li> After using this only once, my hair was lighter, shinier, fuller, and I wasn&#x27;t shedding as I usually do.  I&#x27;m amazed that one use could have that effect.  It seems too good to be true, but then, the pamphlet that came with it did say that cost isn&#x27;t a factor in their ingredient selection.  I&#x27;m a 35 y.o. female who has been experiencing hair loss for 2 years, and I&#x27;ve tried every expensive product out there.  The shampoo I was using prior to this was good, &amp;#34;Davines,&amp;#34; but after using this, I&#x27;m positive that my search is over and that this one will, in time, restore my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review once I&#x27;ve used the product for several months, but as of right now, this one is a winner.  As a young-ish female with hair loss, this is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I liked this shampoo at first, because it made my hair look fuller and feel softer to touch, but after using it only 3 times, I lost SO MUCH HAIR that I had to give up on it. The product label has a warning about possible excessive shedding in the first two weeks of using it, but the question is how much hair are you prepared to lose before you get that peach fuzz to replace it with? I did some research and the doctors are saying that the hair loss caused by this type of product is generally temporary, but it will take months to regrow your hair and I found some people on forums complaining about this rate of shedding going on for two months instead of two weeks. How much hair have you got to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one more thing. If used as directed (twice each time, 5 days a week), it can dry out your scalp and contribute to hair loss. I&#x27;m going back to oil treatments.</li>
    <li> I really like the quality of my hair, but bought the product because I&#x27;ve been experiencing loss of hair. I will purchase this shampoo one more time and make a decision whether to use it if my hair does not show some results of hair growth.</li>
    <li> Only been about 4 weeks but I do &#x27;feel&#x27; a difference in my hair.  I am hopeful that more new hair will show up soon.</li>
    <li> I use the Revita LT - which is what is shown in the photo.  I use it to make existing hair seem thicker and to grow it quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, I&#x27;ve tried it all, here is what I can say.  It sort of coats my hair, which I believe, may make it appear thicker.  I didn&#x27;t have success when I followed it with a regular sulfate-free conditioner, but when I use it by itself, it leaves my hair shiney and appearing thicker.  However, that&#x27;s just a coating.&lt;br /&gt;I can also say, my hair grows quickly now and used to be painfully slow.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think my hair actually grows thicker, however.  At this price, I think it&#x27;s important to note what I&#x27;m saying:&lt;br /&gt;existing hair growth &#x3D; faster,&lt;br /&gt;existing hair &#x3D; coated for temporary thicker *appearance* and is very shiny&lt;br /&gt;hair shedding &#x3D; the same&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful!</li>
    <li> I use this product basically every time I take a shower.  Have been using this well over 2 years now.  Have noticed that my hair has stopped falling out as quickly as it once did.  I use this product with Rogaine as well.  Though this won&#x27;t keep you from going bald, it will slow the process down.  The key is to use this every day as directed!  Sound dumb, but I wash my head with product, leave in for 2 minutes, wash it out and use it again and leave in for about 5 minutes.  You should feel it tingle and work into scalp.  I reallky think the key is to keep it on you head so it can work.  Also they have upgraded the bottle so they don&#x27;t leak as much, which is nice not to have orange goo all in my shower. Cheers</li>
    <li> I have been using this Super expensive shampoo from past 5 months every day and exactly the way its mentioned but it has not helped a bit instead I feel my hair are more thinner now. had lots of hopes on it but wont use it any more after current bottle finishes.</li>
