      <li>YES I have had a problem with this, so I replaced it with one from a computer It fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>Works very good just need to get another power supply</li>
      <li>great beginner kit</li>
      <li>Everything was going great till the front spring broke during a tattoo that now can not be finished till some springs can be ordered and shipped.</li>
      <li>and it was working great.</li>
      <li>this kit is great for starters,but it comes with VCD!not a DVD  </li>
      <li>It was a good deal for your money came with everything you need to start tattooing.</li>
      <li>He is really good and has always wanted one.</li>
      <li>i got this machine for one of my friends he said it was really good</li>
      <li>Everything else was good.</li>
      <li>BUT once you adjust your contact screw to set this machine as a liner, you will be good..</li>
      <li>A good practice starter kit.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>definately a good way to start getting all your supplies together,</li>
      <li>seriously, I HONESTLY thought something else was going to happen..  </li>
      <li>but i love the gun</li>
      <li>and I just wasn&#x27;t satisfied if you would to get this</li>
      <li>i wasnt sure what tattoo kit to buy</li>
      <li>but im glad i bought this one mine</li>
      <li>Maybe if there was a manual it would be better.</li>
      <li>for the first day i had it it worked really good.</li>
      <li>He was absolutely thrilled, and it has worked very well!</li>
      <li>i need a free cord......</li>
      <li>oh and the metle tips dont fit the needles and not all the disposable tips</li>
      <li>Perfect shape, good packaging low price worth the money   buy the Dual Digital Power brick tho   </li>
      <li>The ink icluded showed up bright and high pigmented, however the ink wore easily out of the skin even with right tattoo care.</li>
      <li>but i would say its good for beginners but only for beginners.</li>
      <li>I brought two kits and for the price its not bad but for some reason the power cords keep failing idk y but</li>
      <li>I recieved this product in 3 days which was more than expected since most packages take forever to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>It could bring a little more of A+D  just in case, and the transfer oil does not work right, needs to be more efficient...</li>
      <li>MACHINE (not gun) is pretty good actually, A little slower</li>
      <li>Supplies,  Needles are great, not hooks or dull one, and they are sterialized.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t completely play through the computer, Knowledge of how the assemble a tat gun is very useful but for those of you who don&#x27;t have the knowledge you can find the information on you tube.</li>
      <li>but if you are going to purchase this i would strongly recomend a different brand of ink</li>
      <li>There is only one flaw, the VCD doesn&#x27;t play DVD players including my region free player.  </li>
      <li>(which really defeats the purpose of tattoo, you can&#x27;t use the tattoo machine without the electricity.)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>the dvd wasn&#x27;t much help either ... .</li>
      <li>All the items in the picture were there, decent amount of supplies for the price.</li>
      <li>Definately worth the price especially while it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
      <li>was not missing anything and got here with in 12 hours</li>
      <li>This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 25 year old son.  </li>
      <li>The tattooing dvd did not work- complete</li>
      <li>The only thing you might wanna buy with the kit is real practice skin</li>
      <li>therefore the white became my skin color and the black became a light</li>
      <li>This guy with a lazy eye is tattooing some oriental chick in a seting fit for porn.</li>

    <li> All the items in the picture were there, decent amount of supplies for the price. A good practice starter kit.&lt;br /&gt;But the foot pedal does not work, leaving everything useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whats the point of buying a kit if it doesnt work? Go out and buy yourself something expensive, so you wont end up buying TWO of whatever is broken with cheapass kits....</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in 3 days which was more than expected since most packages take forever to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;The downfall of it was (as listed):&lt;br /&gt;1.Not all of the items in the posted pictures were included in the tattoo machine kit/ the extension cord for the power supply and tattoo machine was included, but missing in the package. (which really defeats the purpose of tattoo, you can&#x27;t use the tattoo machine without the electricity.)&lt;br /&gt;2. The ink icluded showed up bright and high pigmented, however the ink wore easily out of the skin even with right tattoo care. therefore the white became my skin color and the black became a light gray.&lt;br /&gt;3. The tattooing dvd did not work- complete fail, thank God I already have some sort of tattoo knowledge.</li>
    <li> The equipment is just everything expected. There is only one flaw, the VCD doesn&#x27;t play DVD players including my region free player.  It also doesn&#x27;t completely play through the computer, Knowledge of how the assemble a tat gun is very useful but for those of you who don&#x27;t have the knowledge you can find the information on you tube. Other than the bad VCD everything is great including the skins for practicing on. Definately worth the price especially while it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> awesome kit, came in 3 days! aalready done numerous tattoo&#x27;s using the machine, and havent had a single problem. definately a good way to start getting all your supplies together,</li>
    <li> It was a good deal for your money came with everything you need to start tattooing. The only thing you might wanna buy with the kit is real practice skin this stuff feels like a mouse pad an the ink smears when you try to wipe it off and also some green soap other than that this kit has just about everything you need to get to work.</li>
    <li> I brought two kits and for the price its not bad but for some reason the power cords keep failing idk y but its annoying because i brought another kit because i thought the kit was broke and its only a cord....i need a free cord......</li>
    <li> The dvd instructions dont help at all. Maybe if there was a manual it would be better. Something could be missing from the kit but it all seems to be there</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit for my son for his birthday. He is really good and has always wanted one. Everything was going great till the front spring broke during a tattoo that now can not be finished till some springs can be ordered and shipped. After one 4in x 4in tat and one outline the spring broke (no extras came with it). That is the only thing that was bothersome. Everything else was good.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 25 year old son.  He was absolutely thrilled, and it has worked very well!</li>
    <li> Some of the paint bottles sere open so it was messy</li>
    <li> this kit is great for starters,but it comes with VCD!not a DVD  and I couldnt get it 2 play on nothing,but other than that for  $50 bucks I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> i wasnt sure what tattoo kit to buy but im glad i bought this one mine was not missing anything and got here with in 12 hours</li>
    <li> Perfect shape, good packaging low price worth the money   buy the Dual Digital Power brick tho   i rate 5 stars!!  great beginner kit</li>
    <li> Works very good just need to get another power supply</li>
    <li> for the first day i had it it worked really good. the second day it wont turn on now. i dont know why.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my husband i had a allergic reaction so i thought to the ink it was horrid puss bumps sore staph oozing and bleeding and all the ink came out from the infection and i still have issues and outbrakes from it etc was insane went to emergency room and they said it was the ink i was allergic to so i took it to a actual tattoo shop and asked them imediatly he told me to throw the ink away it is imported and not steralized correctly has metal fragments in it and can give you hepatitus from it extremely dangerous the gun is ok for starters but if you are going to purchase this i would strongly recomend a different brand of ink also dont leave it pluged in even if powered off it will fry the power cord and box does not have a shut off to stop the electric flow and the cores will be done for it works for a starter like i said and to learn on just be careful of the ink i would hate for someone to go through what i did and still am its the worst pain ever like it was ripping my leg off and eating it or something i cant stress enough IMPORTED INK!!!!!!!!! bad idea</li>
    <li> had it for awhile peddle broke and the cd is not english and it has Japanese subtitles with o way to change them the pratice sheets r s*** and the power supply cord is glitch no the inkss r crap but i love the gun oh and the metle tips dont fit the needles and not all the disposable tips do ether  i have had it for a year might be hy things have broke but i do like it as an over all starter</li>
    <li> my tattoo gun kinda broke on me after a month :/ but i would say its good for beginners but only for beginners.</li>
    <li> Alrighty then,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MACHINE (not gun) is pretty good actually, A little slower then the norm BUT once you adjust your contact screw to set this machine as a liner, you will be good.. Power cord YES I have had a problem with this, so I replaced it with one from a computer It fits perfectly. Ink  USE THIS INK ONLY ON FRUIT&lt; PRACTICE SKIN&lt; PIG SKIN&lt; and any other media. DO NOT USE ON YOURSLEF OR OTHERS!!!!  I dont trust it....  not made in the US and the standards are different over seas.. Supplies,  Needles are great, not hooks or dull one, and they are sterialized. Metal tips.. ONLY USE ON PRACTICE Media.. Also IF YOU DONOT HAVE AN AUTOCLAVE DONT USE THESE ON ANYONE!!!  IF you do have an autoclave like I do,, These tips will last about 6 to 7 times in the autoclave. There not med grade metal.. other then that YES the DVD/VCD what ever the hell that is is really not good.. This guy with a lazy eye is tattooing some oriental chick in a seting fit for porn. seriously, I HONESTLY thought something else was going to happen..  just the way he looks at her and the close up of HER expressions.. Go out and get the art of tattooing THIS will help you..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~D~&#x27;</li>
    <li> It could bring a little more of A+D  just in case, and the transfer oil does not work right, needs to be more efficient...</li>
    <li> i got this machine for one of my friends he said it was really good and it was working great.</li>
    <li> I got it and 5 days later the motor dies and I just wasn&#x27;t satisfied if you would to get this you might want to get a nother mirror as back up</li>
    <li> power supply broke after a few times using it...would not recommend it the dvd wasn&#x27;t much help either ... .</li>
