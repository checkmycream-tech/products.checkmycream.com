      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to control my hair!</li>
      <li>&amp; I have gone through many products that didn&#x27;t do what they said they would do !</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve looked EVERYWHERE for my favorite!  </li>
      <li>So glad to have found it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>This shampoo gives me masses of curls without any kind of styling at all.  </li>
      <li>I have permed/wavy hair and like the kind of shampoo/conditioner that has more lather to it.  </li>
      <li>Love Suave Captivating Curls Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I have to say that I am shockingly pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so lovely, it curls your hair so well</li>
      <li>I decided to throw my curls up to the gods and just buy the cheapest damn bottle of shampoo and conditioner I could find labelled for curly hair, which ended up being Sunsilk captivating curls.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t get the same excellent results.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores after I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
      <li>I used Pantene for curls for many years.</li>
      <li>so glad to be able to find a case of it online.</li>
      <li>So glad i could find it here.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>which, by the way, are FANTASTIC... just can&#x27;t afford them and didn&#x27;t work as well on my hair as I would have liked.  </li>
      <li>MAKE MORE AND SELL IT</li>
      <li>Suave Captivating Curls... shampoo, conditioner, and mousse.  </li>
      <li>And now I am in love all over again.  </li>
      <li>Use with captivating curls conditioner.</li>
      <li>Works great on my naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and looking great.  </li>
      <li>I have fine and curly/wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already noticed a tremendous change in my hair, it&#x27;s softer, hydrated and my curls are looking a lot healthier!</li>
      <li>This Sauve shampoo did curl my hair when it was longer, but now that i&#x27;ve gotten a haircut, the shampoo is no longer producing any significant curl pattern.  </li>
      <li>Wow, I love it!  </li>
      <li>Heck, ouidad isn&#x27;t exactly chemical free, and Deva curl, even though it may be SLS free, it didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.  </li>
      <li>i believe it is no longer in full production, so i went searching and found this shampoo here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>And while some of them did a few things I was happy with, they never did everything they promised they would do.  </li>
      <li>the only kind of shampoo and conditioner  I ever use then the srtores stopped selling it.</li>
      <li>This conditioner gives just the right amount of detangling and frizz prevention without leaving the grease effect.  </li>
      <li>I have long, curly, fine textured hair and have always had problems finding shampoo and conditioner that keeps my hair tangle free without leaving it looking like a greasy version of Cousin It by days end.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d still rate it positive at 4 stars...</li>
      <li>I have used MANY other brands such as CurlySexyHair, Aquage, etc----they cost way more</li>
      <li>hard to find but great for my natural curly hair.</li>
      <li>Plus I feel the price is really cheap, considering you get 75.6 oz of shampoo (6 x 12.6) for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was really frizzy and seemed like it did things on it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
      <li>Thank You so much</li>
      <li>I think I spent about $6 total for everything and my curls haven&#x27;t looked this good since Sunsilk.  </li>
      <li>Used along with the conditioner, I have noticed a marked improvement in the health of my hair, and in the appearance of it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easier to manage, I have fewer fly-aways, and it stays soft, too.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a surprisingly fantastic product, one that I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It cleans my hair without drying it out and definitely makes my waves much more apparent.</li>
      <li>They are really really soft, they have more volume than before (not miracle volume, but they are a little more bouncy) and the curls actually curl!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad amazon carries it and am totally willing to buy in bulk since it is so hard to find elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Until a few months ago, I was a devout user of Sunsilk&#x27;s Captivating Curls system, until they stopped selling their products in the U.S.</li>
      <li>I have tried many expensive shampoos and conditioners for curly hair and this is by far my favorite</li>
      <li>It works like the old Pantene formula!</li>
      <li>The curls fall at the slightest pull, they are very sensitive, and I have tried almost everything on the market to make my curls stay, be defined, and make them soft.  </li>
      <li>* long story short, I have spent OODLES and OODLES of money on any kind of curling shampoo...</li>
      <li>I have my soft ringlets back and the mousse really helps keep them in shape, and</li>
      <li>- I use the shampoo-conditioner-styling gel combo and it looks natural and has no stiffness or heaviness to it.  </li>
      <li>have natural, soft ringlet curls, and after three months this shampoo has made my hair softer, shinier, and silkier than it ever was before.</li>
      <li>, I have never been a fan of of SLS and all that jazz, but if it keeps my mane pretty and curly, and for a couple bucks every two months or so, I&#x27;ll excuse the chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Wash n Curl was my curling shamppo of choice (gives my hair a curly fixed pattern).  </li>
      <li>First off, I am Greek and have VERY VERY fine and thin curly hair.  </li>
      <li>on a pretty tight budget, so when I saw the price for this, I opted for feasibility over functionality, but I was highly surprised with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nothing else left my hair perfectly soft and curly.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair soft &amp; can only find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>the shampoo 2-3 times a week to let my natural oils help moisturize, and I use the Suave Conditioner daily.</li>
      <li>I have tried different department store and online shampoos and I have yet to find a shampoo that makes my hair feel so soft and defines my curls.</li>
      <li>When the local store stopped carrying this,  I tried several other products without success.</li>
      <li>Some days it&#x27;s really curly, other days its just wavy.</li>
      <li>I went from long hair to a cap of curls and this is just the shampoo to give you a soft cap of curls.</li>

<li> Sauve captivating curls has sodium chloride in it, this is a basic (as in base vs acid) chemical that causes hair to curl or in higher concentrations to relax or straighten, such as in a perm.  </li>
<li> Wash n Curl was the only shampoo i was aware that had a base solution, but this shampoo does as well and is even better at curling than the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It leaves my curls soft and not weighed down.  </li>
<li> I have long hair with a two year old perm and a little scrunching following a wash with this shampoo</li>
<li> A little goes a long way with this stuff</li>
<li> I will admit, a little dab does go a long way.  </li>
<li> Product overpriced due to lack of supply from the manufacturer.</li>
<li> Tried the other Suave products, no longer is there shampoo specifically for curly hair...</li>
<li> Extreme frustration...</li>
<li> Then they changed their formula, and once again, it weighted my hair down.</li>
<li> I have tried several expensive hair products, but I always come back to this!  </li>
<li> The bottles were a mess and had to be washed.</li>
<li> but I was tight on cash</li>
<li> I hate crunchy curls even more than limp curls!  </li>
<li> everyone, but my excitement was a little too premature.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over three months</li>
<li> The frustrating point is Suave has chosen to drop this shampoo and conditioner and only continue making the styling products for the line.</li>
<li> my hair was cut scalp short because I got tired of the dead cat</li>

    <li> My hair is curly, but temperamental. Some days it&#x27;s really curly, other days its just wavy. This Captivating curls shampoo and conditioner is my secret weapon! Perfect curls every time!</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for my daughters&#x27; curly hair.  It worked great and didn&#x27;t cost a lot, and then it was discontinued.  I found it here, and was ecstatic until I saw the price.  Double what I paid at WalMart/Target.  But I knew it worked, so I paid the price.  When it was delivered, 3 of the 6 bottles had leaked.  The bottles were a mess and had to be washed.</li>
    <li> Wow, I love it!  I actually ordered several different well-rated curly hair or anti-frizz shampoos and conditioners, this one is the winner.  The nicest, least frizz curls - I use the shampoo-conditioner-styling gel combo and it looks natural and has no stiffness or heaviness to it.  I hope this product sticks around!!!</li>
    <li> Ok.... so I feel like one of the Doobie Brothers considering that I have felt like I have been on a mission from god to find the right friggen shampoo and conditioner for my stupid unmanageable curls...  First off, I am Greek and have VERY VERY fine and thin curly hair.  The curls fall at the slightest pull, they are very sensitive, and I have tried almost everything on the market to make my curls stay, be defined, and make them soft.  I hate crunchy curls even more than limp curls!  *sigh* long story short, I have spent OODLES and OODLES of money on any kind of curling shampoo...treatment..... conditioner... miracle cream..... whatever..... you name it, I have probably been there.  And while some of them did a few things I was happy with, they never did everything they promised they would do.  So one day, moping around in the walmart haircare aisles.... I decided to throw my curls up to the gods and just buy the cheapest damn bottle of shampoo and conditioner I could find labelled for curly hair, which ended up being Sunsilk captivating curls.  ( I know I know... I&#x27;ll get to the point soon, I promise)  Needless to say, the curly hair gods shone down on me that day because it turns out that for what I wanted out of a shampoo, conditioner, and hair gel, sunsilk gave me ALL of that, PLUS a bag of chips!  And I didn&#x27;t go broke buying them!!!  I thought my curls had been permanently saved as well as my wallet....  *sigh* Yet another roadblock when I notice I can no longer buy sunsilk at walmart anymore... and then I see sunsilk will no longer be distributing anything to the United States anymore?!?!?!?!  AGGGCGHCHHH!H!HHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Extreme frustration... So I went back to my really expensive shampoos.....  *cough cough* deva curl and ouidad *cough cough*  which, by the way, are FANTASTIC... just can&#x27;t afford them and didn&#x27;t work as well on my hair as I would have liked.  So wrapping up my point, I was out of shampoo, yet again, and looking at my bank account, Iwas stressing considering I would have needed to put my hair care products on a credit card.... doesn&#x27;t make me feel too good.  And grabbing at the air, yet again, I was stumbling through the hair care aisles at walmart, and found this.  Suave Captivating Curls... shampoo, conditioner, and mousse.  And now I am in love all over again.  I think I spent about $6 total for everything and my curls haven&#x27;t looked this good since Sunsilk.  They are really really soft, they have more volume than before (not miracle volume, but they are a little more bouncy) and the curls actually curl! I have my soft ringlets back and the mousse really helps keep them in shape, and considering I toss my hair alot and frazzle it up all the time, that&#x27;s saying something.  And I have to admit, I have never been a fan of of SLS and all that jazz, but if it keeps my mane pretty and curly, and for a couple bucks every two months or so, I&#x27;ll excuse the chemicals.  Heck, ouidad isn&#x27;t exactly chemical free, and Deva curl, even though it may be SLS free, it didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all.  I feel like Deva Curl is for hair that needs to be relaxed and softened.  My hair needed to be curled and amped up.  So there ya go. I hope this helps.  And if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, atleast you won&#x27;t be crying about the lost money!</li>
    <li> YEA!  I&#x27;ve looked EVERYWHERE for my favorite!  I now have enough for about 6 months!  Thank you Amazon - I couldn&#x27;t have done it without you!</li>
    <li> I used Pantene for curls for many years. Then they changed their formula, and once again, it weighted my hair down. This Suave product is the answer to the problem! It works like the old Pantene formula!</li>
    <li> I have tried several expensive hair products, but I always come back to this!  It cleans my hair without drying it out and definitely makes my waves much more apparent. It smells great and works great. The best part about it is the price!  This shampoo is very hard to find in stores. I&#x27;m so glad amazon carries it and am totally willing to buy in bulk since it is so hard to find elsewhere.  Arrived promptly and well packaged.</li>
    <li> THE BEST SHAMPOO FOR CURLY HAIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tried the other Suave products, no longer is there shampoo specifically for curly hair...BOO!!!!  So, when I found this online...I immediately bought a box, then another!!!  I&#x27;m using it sparingly because I want it to last.  I will admit, a little dab does go a long way.  MAKE MORE AND SELL IT IT STORES WOULD YOU!!!!!!!????? Jeez.</li>
    <li> I have tried many expensive shampoos and conditioners for curly hair and this is by far my favorite and I had to buy online because I can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I have long hair with a two year old perm and a little scrunching following a wash with this shampoo gives me just the reight amount of curls without friz.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick and curly hair. Before I started using this shampoo and conditioner I wasn&#x27;t able to control my hair! It was really frizzy and seemed like it did things on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the shampoo 2-3 times a week to let my natural oils help moisturize, and I use the Suave Conditioner daily. I&#x27;ve already noticed a tremendous change in my hair, it&#x27;s softer, hydrated and my curls are looking a lot healthier! I even started to get more compliments on my hair! Plus I feel the price is really cheap, considering you get 75.6 oz of shampoo (6 x 12.6) for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the conditioner as well!</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair, then this is the shampoo for you.  It leaves your hair soft &amp; can only find it on Amazon.  I love it !!</li>
    <li> I have looked and looked in local stores for some time for this product.  I have fine and curly/wavy hair.  This shampoo gives me masses of curls without any kind of styling at all.  Leaves my hair soft and looking great.  Use with captivating curls conditioner.</li>
    <li> When the local store stopped carrying this,  I tried several other products without success. Nothing else left my hair perfectly soft and curly. So glad to have found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo, I felt like it made my hair thicker.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I order it online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over three months and I have to say that I am shockingly pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Until a few months ago, I was a devout user of Sunsilk&#x27;s Captivating Curls system, until they stopped selling their products in the U.S. I tried Pantene at first, but was disappointed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on a pretty tight budget, so when I saw the price for this, I opted for feasibility over functionality, but I was highly surprised with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I have natural, soft ringlet curls, and after three months this shampoo has made my hair softer, shinier, and silkier than it ever was before.

    <li> It&#x27;s a good product to help maintain my curly hair.</li>
    <li> this is an acutal curling shampoo vs just an anti frizz or moisturizing shampoo; although it does well at anti frizz also.  Wash n Curl was my curling shamppo of choice (gives my hair a curly fixed pattern).  i believe it is no longer in full production, so i went searching and found this shampoo here on Amazon.  Sauve captivating curls has sodium chloride in it, this is a basic (as in base vs acid) chemical that causes hair to curl or in higher concentrations to relax or straighten, such as in a perm.  Wash n Curl was the only shampoo i was aware that had a base solution, but this shampoo does as well and is even better at curling than the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars...&lt;br /&gt;edit 4-4-2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sorry everyone, but my excitement was a little too premature.  its not sodium chloride (ie salt) that is the basic solution the curls hair; its sodium hydroxide.  this shampoo does not have any, unlike Wash n Curl which does (or did assuming its still in production).  This Sauve shampoo did curl my hair when it was longer, but now that i&#x27;ve gotten a haircut, the shampoo is no longer producing any significant curl pattern.  I&#x27;d still rate it positive at 4 stars...</li>
    <li> this product is crap. I have used some of the most expensive products but I was tight on cash so I decided to get the suave curly hair shampoo and condit. after a couple times using it I noticed painful bumps in my scalp, I had my husband check it and he said they were ingrown hairs. The shampoo striped my hair of any moisture and the condt clogged  my pores and prevented the hairs from growing or getting any air. I will  not recomend this product.</li>
    <li> hard to find but great for my natural curly hair. it controls the curls and makes my hair look it&#x27;s best</li>
    <li> this is one of my fav shampoos and its such a bargain.  6 bottles for less than the price of the salon stuff and seriously works just as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it a million stars if I could. I&#x27;ve never been happier with my hair. It&#x27;s so lovely, it curls your hair so well, Just SCRUNCH SCRUNCH SCRUNCH! A little goes a long way with this stuff</li>
    <li> I have long, curly, fine textured hair and have always had problems finding shampoo and conditioner that keeps my hair tangle free without leaving it looking like a greasy version of Cousin It by days end.  This conditioner gives just the right amount of detangling and frizz prevention without leaving the grease effect.  The frustrating point is Suave has chosen to drop this shampoo and conditioner and only continue making the styling products for the line.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and I can not get it at my local stores.  i found it here online.  I have permed/wavy hair and like the kind of shampoo/conditioner that has more lather to it.  It helps get the tangles out of my curls.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> It makes my wavy hair lay in curls, love it!! Please bring it back to stores!! Shipment was perfect, no problems!!</li>
    <li> the only kind of shampoo and conditioner  I ever use then the srtores stopped selling it. So glad i could find it here.Thank You so much</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this shampoo everywhere.  I have tried different department store and online shampoos and I have yet to find a shampoo that makes my hair feel so soft and defines my curls.</li>
    <li> I went from long hair to a cap of curls and this is just the shampoo to give you a soft cap of curls.</li>
    <li> Of course I wanted my wavy hair to leap into a mass of bouncy curls but no such luck. Still it&#x27;s a nice shampoo at a good price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about two years now, and it is the best for curly hair!  It leaves my curls soft and not weighed down.  I have used MANY other brands such as CurlySexyHair, Aquage, etc----they cost way more but I don&#x27;t get the same excellent results.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore so glad to be able to find a case of it online. Works great on my naturally curly hair</li>
    <li> Love Suave Captivating Curls Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. This product made my hair curl like never before in 60 years &amp; I have gone through many products that didn&#x27;t do what they said they would do ! I let my hair grow out because of this product...my hair was cut scalp short because I got tired of the dead cat look on my head. Now oodles of curls &amp; compliments !I&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for selling this product !!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores after I&#x27;ve been using it for years and now here it is.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> Product overpriced due to lack of supply from the manufacturer. In any case my wife was grateful that I found it.</li>
