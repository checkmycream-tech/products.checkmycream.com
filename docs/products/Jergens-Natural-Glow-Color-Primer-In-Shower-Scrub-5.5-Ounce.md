<ol>
      <li>Best exfoliator ever!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want an abrasive scrub and Jergens is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>BEST STUFF EVER!</li>
      <li>Get yourself a good scrub and a separate exfoliant if you want best results.</li>
      <li>This scrub works great for me.</li>
      <li>But she’s happy</li>
      <li>great, to me&lt;br</li>

      <li>Love the Jergens product!!</li>
      <li>The smell is not over-powering, and is fairly pleasant.</li>
      <li>It is a bit runny like a body wash, but has a good amount of scrubbing bits in it.</li>
      <li>Works well and fair price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does a good job to exfoliate and allow for even results with tanning gels, lotions or mousses.</li>
      <li>This can be good before self-tanning, or just for a bit of exfoliation for your skin.</li>
      <li>I applied the primer rigorously in the shower to try and get a good exfoliation to prevent ill-effects from applying the tan</li>

      <li>This is a nice body wash/scrub combo.</li>
      <li>Nice scrub.  </li>
      <li>really liked how this smells.</li>
      <li>Also the bottle is kind of pricey for the amount that she received.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and it has a bit of a foaming quality.  </li>
      <li>For me, that is a more effective scrub.</li>
      <li>And, to be totally honest, I don&#x27;t intend on getting a tan anytime soon, but I still love using this soap in the shower.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I originally wrote a review stating that this was a nice scrub and that I liked it.</li>
      <li>It also leaves your skin very smooth.  </li>
      <li>This exfoliant foams up nicely when you use it so it is easy to spread it over your skin.  </li>
      <li>The scrub has a very light, refreshing scent</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine to use on its own as well as an in-shower primer.</li>
      <li>It is my fave scrub, after trying so many over the years.</li>
      <li>everyone will love the smell, like I do</li>
      <li>I like this although I don&#x27;t know if if does any better job than my scrubbing cloth.</li>
      <li>This Jergens Primer Scrub is like magic when it comes to that.</li>
      <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel after using it.</li>
      <li>more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used the Jergens primer for two weeks and the results were OK.  </li>
      <li>It is my fave scrub, after trying so many over the years.</li>
      <li>OK, bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like more exfoliation.</li>
      <li>that I needed a harsher primer to get more exfoliation.  </li>
      <li>/exfoliates in it that really do a nice job of scrubbing your skin clean.</li>
      <li>It is merely a very nice skin rub and is a decent value at the price.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant fragrance and you do feel the scrubbing feature, but as for helping bring out your tan, it doesn&#x27;t really deliver that aspect of the product.</li>
      <li>She enjoyed how it smelled and felt that it did a fine job.</li>
      <li>It seems early to think about sunless tanning but with this year&#x27;s winter weather, feeling tanned actually is welcome in my book.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin that needs some exfoliation and/or preparation for self tanning.</li>
      <li>Works great with the natural glow lotion.</li>
      <li>Left my skin silky smooth, and primed it for the best patch/streak free at home tan</li>
      <li>though this is a nice product, I prefer the [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]]</li>
      <li>Cool!</li>
      <li>The scent is more like a clean smell, and it doesn&#x27;t linger or stay on your skin.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate my skin quite as well as some shower scrubs I&#x27;ve used, but it does a good enough job and smells nice.</li>
      <li>The results will be just fine.</li>
      <li>Great idea, but left a bit of a sticky feel that needed more scrubbing to feel completely clean.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed that it was mild in scent and in exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Great product, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>light scent</li>
      <li>it is a very good product, and apparently if you self-tan, it preps the skin really well for that.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell, has lots of little abrasive cleaners in it, and does make the skin feel nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>My skin feels refreshed, clean and smooth after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
      <li>If you can use any commercial product on your skin, this works fine and has a pleasant, nondescript fragrance.</li>
      <li>It is good for exfoliation in general and before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It gets me clean, doesn&#x27;t dry me out, and is awesome at invigorating and gently exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The primer rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>me clean without over drying</li>
      <li>Also my legs felt really super smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
      <li>Scrub is right!</li>
      <li>] When I first saw this, I really thought that it was a kind of pre-dye, for a sunless tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>&quot; enough to do a good job removing excess</li>
      <li>if you you are looking for the most gentle scrub, though.</li>
      <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t like the color, although the product itself is fairly good.</li>
      <li>I would call this a mild scrub that is mildly abrasive.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it from time to time as it does a good job of removing dry, scaly, skin.</li>
      <li>Worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a priming shower scrub.</li>
      <li>There are also ingredients such as Salicyclic acid and fruit extracts which have their own exfoliation</li>
      <li>Worth a try</li>
      <li>and I have no intention of using it more frequently.  </li>
      <li>Jergens Natural Glow shower scrub  is a nice, mild exfoliator that they recommend using prior to self-tanner in order to provide the tanning agents with a smooth, clean, primed start.</li>
      <li>My favorite part of the Jergens Natural Glow Color Primer is the glistening bronze color, thank you theobroma, as it appears in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>DID work to make the glow lotion go on more smoothly, but I didn&#x27;t like the extra scrubbing I needed.</li>
      <li>Jergens Natural Glow Color Primer worked great in the shower and provided a nice, subtly fragrant exfoliation</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells like a typical in-shower product; pleasantly scented.&lt;br</li>
      <li>if you have sensitive skin or simply prefer a milder exfoliant, the Jergens is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say not to use this on your face but given how mild it is, that&#x27;s where I will be using it but will stick to the stronger St. Ives elsewhere.</li>
      <li>the towelette that normally streaks gave me smooth, even color on my legs.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this was a good exfoliating scrub with a bit of extra skin cleanser thrown in - leaves your skin feeling fresh and soft</li>
      <li>and after she went and she was happy with the scent and application except that she said it was kind of gritty and had to be washed by hand down the showered drain to get completely rid of.</li>
      <li>The scent is very mild and dissapears completely.</li>
      <li>This is the best exfoliater I have found in general let along give the perfect base for any color applied!</li>
      <li>It pretty much helps you take a little of the top layer of your skin off so that self-tanner can soak in more evenly.</li>
      <li>I really like that aspect of this!  </li>
      <li>and I ended up abandoning my tanning efforts as I was told by my resident expert (my fianc&amp;eacute;)</li>
      <li>Not an orange color like some, but be sure and use it as evenly as possible.</li>
      <li>exfoliating difference was evident to me in comparing the two side by side.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>To me, it smells exactly like a tanning salon, and I like that smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I chose this body scrub for my mother who said that it works very well in the shower. She enjoyed how it smelled and felt that it did a fine job.</li>
    <li> If you already have an exfoliating scrub you like, I&#x27;d suggest that would be fine to use before using a topical tanning product.  Otherwise, this was a good exfoliating scrub with a bit of extra skin cleanser thrown in - leaves your skin feeling fresh and soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find the scent to be a little strong, but not unpleasant.  Sorta baby powder smelling.</li>
    <li> I got a chance to use this yesterday.  You use this in the shower or bath, lather it on and scrub it in letting the scrubbing sandy particles to their work before rinsing it all off.  I used it just on my legs because that is where I was going to be applying self tanner (Suave Visible Glow).  I noted that there were a lot of particles in the bottom of the tub that I had to rinse down after the water drained.  Had I not done that immediately I think it would have been quite a mess to clean after they dried on (Pro-tip: make sure that you rinse the tub or shower down after you are done.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the self tanner as per those instructions and 24 hours later... a beautiful streak free tan.  Also my legs felt really super smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to tell how much of the benefit though is from this product and how much is from my shaving my legs and rubbing in the self tanner in a through manner.  But I have used this self tanner before and gotten streaks... but was that my carelessness?  So it&#x27;s hard to know.  Still now that I have this product in my arsenal I will definitely use it.  Every little bit helps I think.  Why would you not use it?</li>
    <li> As a scrub, this does a decent job.  Not a self-tanner, it&#x27;s used BEFORE you use any form of self-tanner.  You want to exfoliate your skin before you apply self-tanner.  Consider it, oh, &amp;#34;Step 1,&amp;#34; of self-tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very moderate exfoliant and doesn&#x27;t scrub as much as you may like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My self-tanner went on well afterward so it did its job.  Will I buy it again?  Eh, probably not.  I like more exfoliation.</li>
    <li> This is a decent exfoliating shower scrub at a decent price point. It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate my skin quite as well as some shower scrubs I&#x27;ve used, but it does a good enough job and smells nice. Worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a priming shower scrub.</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF EVER! This is the best exfoliater I have found in general let along give the perfect base for any color applied!</li>
    <li> I originally wrote a review stating that this was a nice scrub and that I liked it. Now I’m updating my review. This stuff is magic! I used it a few times at first thinking, yeah, I like the scent, the consistency, etc. I thought when I run out that I would just use another body scrub. I’ve tried several different scrubs since and nothing has worked like the Jergens. I came back to the product page to repurchase this and thought, I just have to update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t know what’s in this but no other scrub I’ve ever used has been able to strip the old tanner off so I could retan like this one does. I’ve been self-tanning for awhile and there just always comes the time when you need to get all the old color off and start over for a fresh, even tan. This Jergens Primer Scrub is like magic when it comes to that. I get a washcloth or other type cloth, not a loofah or sponge. You want something that is really going to apply that scrub right to your skin with some scrubbing action. The old tan literally just melts away. I’m left with fresh skin for preparation for a self tanner session. If you self-tan, you need this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish the bottle was bigger but that’s the only negative I have.</li>
    <li> This is like a salt scrub, except not as oily and it lathers.  It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue in my shower.  The scent is more like a clean smell, and it doesn&#x27;t linger or stay on your skin.  The primer rinses clean.  You can also use this for your hands, after you have applied self tanner, and it will take off any color.  I really like that aspect of this!  It also leaves your skin very smooth.  By removing the dead skin, you expose the layer that will absorb lotions and self tanners more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does exactly what it says it does.  It is a winner!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a shower body wash with a little more to it, this does the job. It has a pleasant fragrance and you do feel the scrubbing feature, but as for helping bring out your tan, it doesn&#x27;t really deliver that aspect of the product. The price may caution other to buy because you can find more inexpensive body washes and get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> Works well and fair price.</li>
    <li> I like this although I don&#x27;t know if if does any better job than my scrubbing cloth.</li>
    <li> really helps color and no streaking</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t use a self-tanner, I do like to exfoliate my skin from time to time - especially my elbows, knees, and feet.  I tried this product and really liked it.  The bottle somewhat misleading as it seems to infer that the product some for of self-tanning properties - it does not.  It is merely a very nice skin rub and is a decent value at the price.  I will continue to use it from time to time as it does a good job of removing dry, scaly, skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for the price. I keep it in the shower and use it about once a week. Works great with the natural glow lotion. Not an orange color like some, but be sure and use it as evenly as possible.</li>
    <li> Nice scrub.  Small bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the Jergens product!! However you do not need to buy this. You can exfoliate by shaving or just by using soap and a loofa and scrubbing your body.</li>
    <li> This scrub works great for me. I use it mainly on my elbows, arms, legs and knees. When applied with some water it foams up just the right amount to gently scrub my skin. I didn&#x27;t want an abrasive scrub and Jergens is perfect for me. I cannot believe the difference on my elbows and knees. They&#x27;re so much softer. My skin feels refreshed, clean and smooth after I&#x27;ve used it. The scent is mild and pleasant.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice body wash/scrub combo. It is a bit runny like a body wash, but has a good amount of scrubbing bits in it. The scent is rather hard to describe - somewhat sweet, but it does not last long at all. It goes away as you use it in the shower, actually, so I would say that it is not highly scented at all and it will not linger on your skin after you get out of the shower. Looking at the bottle and product, I expected a brown sugar scent or a tanning oil/coconut/tropical type scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell like any of those though. I don&#x27;t see this as a drawback, just mentioning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a small bottle (5.5oz), but if you don&#x27;t use it everyday, you will get longer use of it. I&#x27;m not sure that its the best value since it is a smaller bottle, but it depends what you are used to paying and how much you end up liking the product overall. I have paid much, much more for the same amount of other brands, so it is all personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it does suds up a little. With a lot of scrubs, there is no soapy or sudsy effect so I feel like it isn&#x27;t really cleaning my skin while it scrubs - that&#x27;s not the case with this one though. It is a nice combination of shower gel and scrub. I do think it leaves my skin a little a dry after using it though, so I make sure to apply my lotion asap when I get out of the shower. I knocked a star off the rating because of the drying effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job to exfoliate and allow for even results with tanning gels, lotions or mousses. Of course you can get the same results with any scrub, though. I don&#x27;t see any specific reason why this is advertised specifically for use with tanning products, other than being a marketing gimmick. You could use it, like any other scrub, even if you do not use tanning products. It is good for exfoliation in general and before shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really see any reason to use this scrub instead of my usual scrub, whether using tanning products or not. I don&#x27;t see any specific benefits with it or any results that couldn&#x27;t be obtained with other scrubs.

    <li> I would call this a mild scrub that is mildly abrasive. Great for sensitive skin that needs some exfoliation and/or preparation for self tanning. The smell is not over-powering, and is fairly pleasant. The apricot seed powder do a good job without scraping you up or irritating my skin. It&#x27;s fine to use on its own as well as an in-shower primer. It&#x27;s thick enough to not have to worry about running through your fingers easily. The problem is that you don&#x27;t get a lot for your money and I think you can probably find a better value in other products.</li>
    <li> This exfoliant foams up nicely when you use it so it is easy to spread it over your skin.  The scrubbing bits are fairly gentle so you shouldn&#x27;t worry that you will irritate your skin.  In fact I almost wondered if it was \\&quot;scrubby\\&quot; enough to do a good job removing excess skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is a nice product, I prefer the [[ASIN:B000UVY8IE St. Ives, Fresh Skin Apricot Scrub, 6oz]] because it is less expensive.</li>
    <li> Picked this up in a Walmart for just under $10. I appreciate a not so harsh scrub as you don&#x27;t actually need a coarse scrub to get a good exfoliation  (just exfoliate more often!) The smell is great,  and tho this is a colored scrub with bronze sparkle .. the color sparkles rinse away. What you are left with is smooth polished glowy skin... Cool! I&#x27;m real inexperienced to the whole self tanner thing.  So my first attempt with Banana Boat Color Radiance left me with some darker areas that was just my novice approach. Anyway, I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars for its price and the fact it&#x27;s not in a pump!!</li>
    <li> Best exfoliator ever! Left my skin silky smooth, and primed it for the best patch/streak free at home tan I&#x27;ve ever had! Definitely will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> This is sort of a speciality product that you might want to use prior to using a product such as Jergens Natural Glow Instant Sun Sunless Tanning Mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is an in-shower scrub which &amp;#34;resurfaces &amp; primes skin to prepare for streak-free, flawless color.&amp;#34;  It features an amino fruit extract complex and can be used prior to using a sunless tanner, glow moisturizer or spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product contains tiny beads or grit (apricot seed) which exfoliate.  There are also ingredients such as Salicyclic acid and fruit extracts which have their own exfoliation properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a typical in-shower product; pleasantly scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to soften and smoothe my skin and does exfoliate when agitated into a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use sunless tanning products but I do like this product for its ability to resurface skin without irritation.</li>
    <li> The  Jergens Natural Glow Color Primer is an in-shower scrub for use before you apply a sunless tanner. I plan to use this scrub for the scrubbing, moisturizing properties rather than before applying a sun tanner. The scrub has a very light, refreshing scent and I love the way it makes my skin feel after using it. I like that it is thick and doesn&#x27;t drip when I apply it to my skin. I recommend this scrub for the moisturizing effect.</li>
    <li> I agree with several other reviewers that the color of this product is misleading. It is simply a body scrub, and has no tanning properties whatsoever. Of course, I knew that when I got it, so it wasn&#x27;t a surprise to me. Personally, I don&#x27;t like the color, although the product itself is fairly good. It has a pleasant smell, has lots of little abrasive cleaners in it, and does make the skin feel nice and smooth. It is a bit thick (I know some people really like that) but it means you need to do a longer rinse to get it all off. All in all it is a very good product, and apparently if you self-tan, it preps the skin really well for that. But I don&#x27;t self tan so as a pure body scrub, I only give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> It seems early to think about sunless tanning but with this year&#x27;s winter weather, feeling tanned actually is welcome in my book. While the color and name of the product implies it is a sunless tanner, it&#x27;s actually a pre-application scrub to prepare and &amp;#34;resurface&amp;#34; the skin for a smooth, even result after applying a sunless tanner next. This product doesn&#x27;t offer any color at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is typical of many scrubs and comes from apricot seed powder and acrylates copolymers. If you can use any commercial product on your skin, this works fine and has a pleasant, nondescript fragrance. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s particularly formulated to work with Jergens Natural Glow tanless products, so you don&#x27;t have to buy this product to make the other Jergens Natural Glow tanners work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with sensitive skin, there are some other ingredients that may irritate such as: sodium chloride, benzyl alcohol, lemon juice, grapefruit juice and salicylic acid, among others. If you require an all-natural or a product designed for sensitive skin, this isn&#x27;t it. Because of the ingredients, the directions warn not to use on broken skin ( IMO, DEF. NOT AFTER SHAVING!) and avoid contact with your eyes.</li>
    <li> Great idea, but left a bit of a sticky feel that needed more scrubbing to feel completely clean.  DID work to make the glow lotion go on more smoothly, but I didn&#x27;t like the extra scrubbing I needed.</li>
    <li> This can be good before self-tanning, or just for a bit of exfoliation for your skin. It pretty much helps you take a little of the top layer of your skin off so that self-tanner can soak in more evenly. It gets the job done for that purpose well. Considering the time and effort it takes to smooth self-tanners on very evenly and to wait for them to finish working, and then clean yourself up so your hands don&#x27;t end up being orange, I think it&#x27;s worth a little extra money to use something that&#x27;ll maximize the effect and let it stick longer.</li>
    <li> Not only does this pre-tan-towel gel exfoliate, it leaves skin feeling silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;And it actually does it on the cheap, because a little goes a long way. It is low lather, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t working. The results will be just fine. Small circular movements work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very light scent, that doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin for hours and hours...a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;Even the towelette that normally streaks gave me smooth, even color on my legs.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use in the shower to remove any rough or dead skin before applying sunless tanning lotion.  It helps to ensure a nice even coverage of tanning color, without any dark spots on rough areas of the skin.  The scent is nice and it has a bit of a foaming quality.  It rinses off well and doesn&#x27;t make the shower pan icky.  Over all, I really like this and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> My wife is going to try this new tanning spot across the street from us so she has used this product a few times before and after she went and she was happy with the scent and application except that she said it was kind of gritty and had to be washed by hand down the showered drain to get completely rid of. Also the bottle is kind of pricey for the amount that she received. But she’s happy so that makes me happy. She said that she would use it again!</li>
    <li> Jergens Natural Glow shower scrub  is a nice, mild exfoliator that they recommend using prior to self-tanner in order to provide the tanning agents with a smooth, clean, primed start. It is tinted brown, but does not leave any sort of color on your skin, as it contains no tanning agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and sudsy when used with a shower puff, but there is little sudsing if you want to apply by hand. The scent is very mild and dissapears completely. A bonus for me is that it does NOT smell like the beach. Not everyone wants a coconut, vanilla, or sunscreen scent with a shower product. I enjoyed that it was mild in scent and in exfoliation. It could be used daily in summer or winter to combat dry skin without being too aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an intense scrub, you would need to stick to a sugar scrub type of wash, but this does a nice job without being too irritating to the skin and leaves my skin clean and soft. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size of the bottle, and I have used other brands (like St. Ives) that are similar, a bit more intense, and have done the same job. Worth a try if you you are looking for the most gentle scrub, though.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and use a combination of self-tanning lotions and the actual sun (I like to try to keep most of my tan year round and use moisturizers with some self-tanning capabilities in them).  Jergens Natural Glow Color Primer worked great in the shower and provided a nice, subtly fragrant exfoliation experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great lather and gentle exfoliation that did the trick with taking off that extra layer of dried skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than expected, more gentle than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:499ed4484bdf8e8e216e40ffcd2b1fd4]] When I first saw this, I really thought that it was a kind of pre-dye, for a sunless tanning lotion. It&#x27;s not. Well, you are supposed to use it before a spray-on tan, but it&#x27;s actually supposed to exfoliate before coloring, not do anything to color you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my credit, the scrub is a viscous, shimmery shiny deep brown, and it really looks like it might have darkened my skin by just using it. But, as soon as you mix it with water, all of the shiny stuff besides the dark exfoliating beads turn to suds and it no longer looks like it&#x27;ll coat you a layer darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked how this smells. To me, it smells exactly like a tanning salon, and I like that smell. It&#x27;s a kind of strange mishmash of various smells, lotions, and scents, and somehow they collected it all in this bottle. And, to be totally honest, I don&#x27;t intend on getting a tan anytime soon, but I still love using this soap in the shower. It gets me clean, doesn&#x27;t dry me out, and is awesome at invigorating and gently exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Smells great, to me&lt;br /&gt;+Awesome job at exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;+Great shower scrub&lt;br /&gt;+Gets me clean without over drying&lt;br /&gt;+Excellent preparation for tanning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Not everyone will love the smell, like I do</li>
    <li> My wife tried this product and was not especially impressed. Here are her comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing about this scrub is that it takes a while to lather and the lather isn&#x27;t particularly voluminous. Plenty of other scrubs do a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing is that this is supposed to be used as an exfoliant prior to adding tanning creams or products of that nature. That&#x27;s all well and good, but an exfoliant glove or other specific product does just as well or better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do I want a product that is a so-so scrub, and a so-so exfoliant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll give this three stars as a middle of the road kind of product that does a couple of different things but neither of them especially well. Get yourself a good scrub and a separate exfoliant if you want best results.</li>
    <li> The Jergens Natural Glow Primer In-Shower Scrub is a mild exfoliant intended to be used prior to any self tanning application.&lt;br /&gt;It has a rich consistency and slight fragrance - nothing that lingers or is overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;There are two things to note with this product - as others have mentioned, despite its deep, bronze color and \\&quot;natural glow\\&quot; name, it is NOT a self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;The other is that this is a very mild exfoliant. I normally use the St. Ives apricot scrub prior to applying a bronzer. For me, that is a more effective scrub. Walnut shell powder is the second ingredient listed in the St. Ives while apricot seed powder is listed fourth in the Jergens.&lt;br /&gt;That exfoliating difference was evident to me in comparing the two side by side.&lt;br /&gt;But if you have sensitive skin or simply prefer a milder exfoliant, the Jergens is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say not to use this on your face but given how mild it is, that&#x27;s where I will be using it but will stick to the stronger St. Ives elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My favorite part of the Jergens Natural Glow Color Primer is the glistening bronze color, thank you theobroma, as it appears in the bottle.  The cocoa adds color and an ever so slight hint of scent.  With finely ground apricot kernels and fruit acids, the scrub gently exfoliates the skin, removing dead cells in the shower while at the same time, a light fragrance enhances the senses.  It definitely smooths and prepares the skin for the day.  It is recommended to use the product once a week and I have no intention of using it more frequently.  When dispensed and applied, the color of the product clearly fades to a milky appearance.  This is the most non-abrasive scrub I&#x27;ve used because the granules are miniscule, but the smooth texture leaves less residue on the human body and the tub floor.</li>
    <li> Scrub is right! This cleanser has small abrasives/exfoliates in it that really do a nice job of scrubbing your skin clean. There may be a hint of fragrance in it, but it is barely noticeable if its in there. You don&#x27;t have to necessarily be using this stuff for pre-tanning or coloring treatment. as a simple skin cleanser it works just fine.</li>
    <li> Being in North Dakota for several years accumulating what I call the \\&quot;Norwegian pale\\&quot; shade of skin color I often thought about applying a tan.  I used the Jergens primer for two weeks and the results were OK.  I applied the primer rigorously in the shower to try and get a good exfoliation to prevent ill-effects from applying the tan and I found myself working harder than I should.  In short, the primer didn&#x27;t work well at scrubbing and I ended up abandoning my tanning efforts as I was told by my resident expert (my fianc&amp;eacute;) that I needed a harsher primer to get more exfoliation.  OK, bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, I did feel fairly clean after hard scrubbing but I doubt that&#x27;s the point.</li>
