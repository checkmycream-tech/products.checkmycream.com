      <li>This scent doesn&#x27;t smell like the original scent...</li>

    <li> This is pretty in the beginning with some flowers: gardenia, jasmine, rose &amp; barely-there tuberose.  But they all disappear in to the ether in less than 30 minutes.  Then you have patchouli &amp; that is about it.  This smells really dated to me; a mature woman in the 1990&#x27;s would have worn this but now it&#x27;s pass&amp;eacute;.  I really do not care for this fragrance.  This may be a victim of reformulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very weak fragrance &amp; the patchouli barely lasts a couple hours on my skin.</li>
