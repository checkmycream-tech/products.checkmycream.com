      <li>Happy Camper for this guy.</li>
      <li>Great fall all seasons..</li>
      <li>Still a good scent, but</li>
      <li>He laughed and told me no worries as he used to get tons of compliments from the gals.</li>
      <li>This fragrance smells really good..</li>
      <li>I recommend it to all women who are wanting something really nice for their man.</li>
      <li>and I must say the gay dudes do know about what smells good.</li>
      <li>Should be more popular</li>
      <li>there are many females</li>
      <li>The ladies seem to love it as well.</li>
      <li>Recieve many compliments.</li>
      <li>Absolutely authentic product.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Hanae Mori for men.</li>
      <li>Just right!!</li>
      <li>Although, its very sweet; has a strong lemon in it..</li>
      <li>Its a very clean light scent that you can wear any time.</li>
      <li>Ive been wearing Hanae Mori since 2000 on the recommendation forom a gay buddy.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, not to strong, not to light, just right for me.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is warm and sexy, yet soft and sensual.</li>
      <li>This is a great cologne that last all day.</li>
      <li>HM by Hanae Mori for men is such a wonderful classic fragrance for any man on any occasion.</li>
      <li>I found to be a very pleasant and mild scent which at the same time is masculine.</li>
      <li>It has a good smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than eight hours, I think if they increase the time on the aroma it will be good to use on the every day basic, also they should take their time to go back to the basics and put more work in to it.</li>
      <li>The good thing about this scent is that it lasts a very long time, meaning it is good for the entire work day.</li>
      <li>Real product for a real discount!!!</li>
      <li>And as one reviewer mentioned, the bottle doesn&#x27;t seem official -- the etching of the name came right at the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>14 years later Im still getting nice looks and smiles as well as compliments on my fine taste in colognes from the female persuasion.</li>
      <li>and If you are the type who likes the scents I mentioned, Hanae Mori will certainly appeal to your taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Im straight as an arrow</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this toilette water spray &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; however it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long at least as far as I can smell.  </li>
      <li>A fantastic smelling scent that will get a lot of positive comments from women (in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;Not too sharp or overpowering,  </li>
      <li>Fragrance is mild enough.</li>
      <li>I detest strong scents and also not very fond of feminine type of scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The dry-down fragrance is much different than when first sprayed (when first sprayed it seems a bit strong and sharp) - so, as any fragrance afficionado knows, do not be alarmed -</li>
      <li>No negative comments from the recipient</li>
      <li>The HM box and bottle is also amazing and very classy - black box, frosted glass, platinum lasered lettering and a cap that is reminiscent of the end of a samaurai sword.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first when I bought some back in 2000 as I used to joke w/</li>
      <li>As long as you buy from Amazon itself and not from marketplace you should rest assured you will get the right product.</li>
      <li>The Cologne is very fresh and last long.</li>
      <li>I am very particular about the scent I wear, I am a sales professional and I also have to work outdoors on a regular basis, I have clients from all walks of life.</li>
      <li>I am old school</li>
      <li>I bought the Billy Jealousy eau de parfum a few weeks later, and it smells WAY better.  </li>
      <li>The smell is very strong, not pleasant, and it hangs around all day.  </li>
      <li>I chose this EDT Spray for my boyfriend as a Christmas present because he really loves the classic Obsession for Men, and I wanted to give him something in the same fragrance family (Woodsy-Oriental) that was a bit lighter/softer to add to his collection.</li>
      <li>This fragrance and its packaging looks and smells far more expensive than the Amazon price tag.</li>
      <li>Which could be good or bad.  </li>

<li> But doesn&#x27;t last as long as this one does.</li>
<li> you should spray the fragrance in the air and walk through it for a lighter scent (spraying an additional bit on pulse points - inner elbows, wrists, and chest for a heavier scent) and allow to dry down for a few minutes for fragrance perfection!</li>
<li> Other people can smell it when I spray it in my hair though.  </li>
<li> Usually the smell does not last in other Hanae Mori that I brought from other seller.</li>
<li> Soft pleasing fragrance for casual days</li>
<li> I have in the past and even now been using scents like, Fahrenheit, Kouros, Paco Robane, Givenchy and Aramis.</li>
<li> If you prefer understated, complex colognes then this is for you.</li>
<li> The longevity is at least 8 hours..</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
<li> Trust me you will see the difference compared to the overpriced crap that comes from the snooty designers on the market now.</li>

    <li> Soft pleasing fragrance for casual days</li>
    <li> Purchased for my boyfriend and he loves it...great deal!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this for years along with the body wash and hair shampoo.  Fragrance is mild enough.</li>
    <li> Absolutely authentic product. Real product for a real discount!!! Can&#x27;t go wrong with that.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Hanae Mori for men.This cologne smells so great on my boyfriend. I recommend it to all women who are wanting something really nice for their man.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne that last all day. Its a very clean light scent that you can wear any time. Well i work there are many females and they all seem to like it. I&#x27;m very happy with this cologne i will be buy it again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  No negative comments from the recipient and he got what he requested.  Happy Camper for this guy.</li>
    <li> HM by Hanae Mori for men is such a wonderful classic fragrance for any man on any occasion. I chose this EDT Spray for my boyfriend as a Christmas present because he really loves the classic Obsession for Men, and I wanted to give him something in the same fragrance family (Woodsy-Oriental) that was a bit lighter/softer to add to his collection. The fragrance is warm and sexy, yet soft and sensual.

The HM box and bottle is also amazing and very classy - black box, frosted glass, platinum lasered lettering and a cap that is reminiscent of the end of a samaurai sword. This fragrance and its packaging looks and smells far more expensive than the Amazon price tag. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Woodsy-Oriental fragrance for themselves or as a gift for the man in their life!</li>
    <li> A great seller. The Cologne is very fresh and last long. Usually the smell does not last in other Hanae Mori that I brought from other seller. But this one is excellent</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this toilette water spray &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; however it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long at least as far as I can smell.  Other people can smell it when I spray it in my hair though.  Received lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Anyone who get closer will ask what is this fragrance. Should be more popular and so I spread the news.</li>
    <li> It has a good smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t last more than eight hours, I think if they increase the time on the aroma it will be good to use on the every day basic, also they should take their time to go back to the basics and put more work in to it.</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong, not pleasant, and it hangs around all day.  Which could be good or bad.  I bought the Billy Jealousy eau de parfum a few weeks later, and it smells WAY better.  But doesn&#x27;t last as long as this one does.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about the scent I wear, I am a sales professional and I also have to work outdoors on a regular basis, I have clients from all walks of life. I detest strong scents and also not very fond of feminine type of scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hanae Mori I found to be a very pleasant and mild scent which at the same time is masculine. The good thing about this scent is that it lasts a very long time, meaning it is good for the entire work day. It does not call attention to itself and women will not be swarming like bees to its smell. I have in the past and even now been using scents like, Fahrenheit, Kouros, Paco Robane, Givenchy and Aramis. I am old school and If you are the type who likes the scents I mentioned, Hanae Mori will certainly appeal to your taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second bottle that I have bought from Amazon. I have no issues with it whatsoever. As long as you buy from Amazon itself and not from marketplace you should rest assured you will get the right product.</li>
    <li> Have alwaysloved the smell....like cotton candy</li>
    <li> A fantastic smelling scent that will get a lot of positive comments from women (in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;Not too sharp or overpowering,  Just right!!</li>
    <li> Great scent!  Recieve many compliments.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that this might be a counterfeit item and i&#x27;m starting to think the same.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the store bought item, I feel.  And as one reviewer mentioned, the bottle doesn&#x27;t seem official -- the etching of the name came right at the bottom of the bottle.  Still a good scent, but I question it&#x27;s authenticity.</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells really good.. Got a lot of compliments.. Although, its very sweet; has a strong lemon in it.. Smells like a lemon pastry.. The longevity is at least 8 hours.. Great fall all seasons.. If you like sweet/citrus fragrances, I would recommend this one..</li>
    <li> If you prefer understated, complex colognes then this is for you. The ladies seem to love it as well. I wholeheartedly endorse this cologne.</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing Hanae Mori since 2000 on the recommendation forom a gay buddy. Im straight as an arrow and I must say the gay dudes do know about what smells good. I was hesitant at first when I bought some back in 2000 as I used to joke w/him that I was hoping the females would like the scent and NOT the dudes. He laughed and told me no worries as he used to get tons of compliments from the gals. I decided what the hell and 14 years later Im still getting nice looks and smiles as well as compliments on my fine taste in colognes from the female persuasion. Trust me you will see the difference compared to the overpriced crap that comes from the snooty designers on the market now.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this scent and so do I</li>
    <li> Love the smell, not to strong, not to light, just right for me.</li>
