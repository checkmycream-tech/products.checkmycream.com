    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Shampoo was watery not thick as it usually is. Was very disappointed</li>
    <li> THE best shampoo ever!</li>
    <li> This product seems to be a bit thinner than it use to be. The manufacturer, Mastey may have changed the formula. The distributor provided fast accurate shipping. Will use them again</li>
    <li> Watered down and couldn&#x27;t get a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found any shampoo that works as well as this one. I don&#x27;t have thin hair--in fact it&#x27;s pretty thick and gets oily. But this shampoo works well, even though it is best for revitalizing thin dry hair. It cleans well, so I don&#x27;t feel the need to use some kind of astringent shampoo to remove any build-up. It&#x27;s gentle, and never leaves my skin feeling dried out. It has my favorite shampoo scent of all time--pina colada. Note: if you want the ultimate in silky smoothness, you can always benefit from following-up with the right conditioner. But as a daily routine, this shampoo is perfect, leaving very little residue behind, while leaving your hair feeling clean, healthy, and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for years and really love it.  However, the packaging is a problem.  The plunger does not work properly, especially when the shampoo is 2/3 gone.  I have to remove it and just try and shake some into my hand.  They really need to provide another cover or adjust the plunger.  I don&#x27;t know if I will continue to use this product if they don&#x27;t correct the problem.  It is just too much work to get the shampoo out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this mild shampoo!</li>
    <li> This is still my very favorite shampoo, even though it is old and not &amp;#34;trending&amp;#34;. I love how clean my hair is after using this shampoo and the accompanying Mastey Frehair Conditioner. Fantastic product; wish it was still &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses this product on a consistent basis. She is happy to be able to get this in the large size bottles and at such a great price compared to local purchases in smaller bottles.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Have used for years and years.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from my hairdresser and I will never use anything else. I can&#x27;t believe how awesome my hair looks from using this brand.  It&#x27;s never  looked this good. And belive me.  I&#x27;m not one to say something like that easily.  It&#x27;s sulfite free which means it doesn&#x27;t lather up the way most shampoos do.  But it also means it doesn&#x27;t strip your natural oils which is important to me living in dry Colorado. I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s worth the extra cost.  I never thought there was THAT  much difference with higher priced shampoos and conditioners but I&#x27;m a believer,  please never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome.  Takes all the frizz out of my hair and makes it really soft.  The pumps that come with the product do not work though.  I used another wider pump that I had on hand.  I do highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Hard to find have used this shampoo for many years .  I wash my hair once a day it is never frizzy and smells like coconut.</li>
    <li> Mastey Traite Cream Shampoo is GREAT.  This product has no harmful ingredients.  Have used it for years and it is impossible to find locally.</li>
    <li> Mastey Traite Cream Shampoo is great for color treated &amp; damaged hair.  It has a fresh clean scent and makes hair very healthy looking.</li>
    <li> This is a no-sulfate shampoo. It cleans wonderfully. There is not a lot of bubbles, but I&#x27;m OK with that. A little goes a long way-it is really really thick. This can be used as a body wash, also, in a pinch. I color my hair and it is very gentle. I won&#x27;t use anything else. I buy it bulk (2 32ox bottles) and it is delivered quickly. It is tough to squeeze it out of the top, so I unscrew the lid and use it.</li>
    <li> Mastry makes several uses.  I use Traite which i love.  I have used it for about 20 years now.  I have very white hair and scalp shows though.  This is the only shampoo i have ever found that treats my scalp with love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 10 years. Would not use anything else. It works and is recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
    <li> I have used  this product for over 30 years and it is perfect for fine hair.  It cleans thoroughly but leaves no residue and is very gentle.  I can no longer find it in Canada and am very pleased with both the availability and price through Amazon.</li>
