      <li>And it smells amazing!!!!</li>
      <li>Smell good!</li>
      <li>I read that the Palmer&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work that great for existing marks</li>
      <li>This product is great.  </li>
      <li>It is really great for reducing stretch marks and preventingthe way they look.</li>
      <li>It smells great and moisturizes well</li>
      <li>This worked great for me.</li>
      <li>Great results.</li>
      <li>way its probably good for your skin.</li>
      <li>I cannot say whether or not this is a good product because I can wear it, but beware expectant moms sniff before purchasing.</li>
      <li>And I like the texture of it, so so good, not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>Might be good as prevention cream...</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>This cream smells so good, and feels so nice on my skin, that I use it where I don&#x27;t have stretch marks.</li>
      <li>Love it !</li>
      <li>I am using it again and love it!</li>
      <li>I honestly believe that this stuff helps a bit.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and is affordable.  </li>
      <li>Please do your own research for the safety of yourself and your kids.</li>
      <li>but this one has worked best so far.</li>
      <li>We all agree that is an excellent product for preventing stretch marks and having a really soft skin.</li>
      <li>It came through the mail in good timing and the product was well worth it!</li>
      <li>This product smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy, and helps relieve the itch right away, it has also helped keep my stretch marks very light in color -</li>
      <li>my pregnant wife says it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it works for severe stretchmarks, and mine are very light, but they will help conceal the light kind.  </li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t that great, and the consistency of the cream is not so liquid: people seem to like it like that, but unless you are an expert applying cream to large portions of your body, it means that you need to use more of it.</li>
      <li>SURE YOU USE A LOT.  </li>
      <li>i love this cream</li>
      <li>I like this cream better than lotion</li>
      <li>Well, I love it.  </li>
      <li>but I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>Palmer&#x27;s olive and shea butter are so much better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll change the review :-)</li>
      <li>I think that if you use it every day, and drink lots of water, you can avoid getting most stretch marks.</li>
      <li>If your skin isn&#x27;t moisturized, you r skin will rip more.</li>
      <li>this stuff is 90% better than mederma and way cheaper.</li>
      <li>SURE YOU DRINK A LOT OF WATER.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the product and the order was received right within the scheduled time.    </li>
      <li>it didnt completely fade them but the product made my skin softer and my scars noticibly faded great product been using this product ever since</li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t like sweet scents, just don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
      <li>I was so happy with this product that have recommended to all of my future mom friends.</li>
      <li>It claims to be parable free on all their products.</li>
      <li>, I feel like it offers good coverage.</li>
      <li>I like using this as a regular lotion because it&#x27;s super moisturizing and the smell is great.</li>
      <li>So i have gained a significant amount for my size.</li>
      <li>Just within 2 days of using this product, I saw a significant difference on my body.</li>
      <li>I was told by a post mortem nurse though, that this kind of anti-stretch mark ointment has a better effect on Asian women than Caucasian ones.</li>
      <li>I also have full confidence that it will help to fade them after I give birth.</li>
      <li>I am sure the baby appreciated the massage as well.</li>
      <li>I will use this after my next baby for sure. :)</li>
      <li>I was pregnant until I gave birth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just 15 weeks pregnant</li>
      <li>Bought this for a pregnant friend and she said it worked well.</li>
      <li>i was pregnant.</li>
      <li>When I got pregnant I gained 70 pounds (I know...)  </li>
      <li>I started using this product when I was pregnant with my daughter.</li>
      <li>WHEN I WAS PREGNANT</li>
      <li>before i got pregnant and now weigh 119 lbs.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since I was 7 months pregnant</li>
      <li>I used this along with parmers tommy butter and lotion when I was pregnant.</li>
      <li>I am 5 months pregnant and just became educated on ingredients in the products I have been applying to my hair and skin.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>I had originally purchased this cream during my first pregnancy to avoid stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I started using this last night, and the difference in my stretch marks over night are amazing.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>I am 8.5 months right now</li>
      <li>right after i shower.</li>
      <li>This product has worked wonderfully for me not sure if i just got lucky and have super elastic skin or if it actually worked</li>
      <li>I am not currently pregnant but still use this cream because I love smelling like chocolate :)</li>
      <li>I am pregnant for the first time and very concerned about getting stretch marks.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased to not have one single stretchmark on my belly thanks to this cream.</li>
      <li>It was a good way to pamper myself and to spend a little time with my tummy.</li>
      <li>This makes no sense to me that a product marketed for pregnant women would have such a strong aroma instead of being odorless.</li>
      <li>i hope it still works for my last months of pregnancy since those months are the ones where the belly stretches more</li>
      <li>This is my first pregnancy</li>
      <li>I used this cream during my first pregnancy and got no stretch marks.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been using the cream consistently</li>
      <li>Palmer&#x27;s cream is inexpensive, thick and creamy, and it smells great (assuming you like the coconutty smell of cocoa butter, which I do).</li>
      <li>I use Palmers skin therapy oil first</li>
      <li>Please note that the marks do not go away completely, however their appearance is significantly reduced.</li>
      <li>as desc and it works, it really works</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>it has helped this appearance of stretch marks but not as much and as fast as i would.</li>
      <li>My wife really likes this brand of cosmetic products.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say for stretch marks though because I haven&#x27;t experimented.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use much to cover my whole belly, so the tube lasted for quite a while.  </li>
      <li>thanks amazon      carlton</li>
      <li>Skin seems to absorbe it really well, though.</li>
      <li>This really worked for me.</li>
      <li>But now that I am getting ready for a vacation in May, I thought I should be using it because I lost some weight</li>
      <li>I believe it really does work.  </li>
      <li>However I was really amazed with this product.</li>
      <li>I was pregnant with my first child &amp; used this product religiously with no results.  </li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s due to the cream or to my genetic I cannot say, but what is for sure is that my skin feels hydrated and elastic and I&#x27;m not having belly itching either.   </li>
      <li>It doesnt work well for stretch marks that are old and highly doubt if they will work for new ones as well, save your money!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> as desc and it works, it really works</li>
    <li> this stuff is 90% better than mederma and way cheaper. thx Palmer people.</li>
    <li> I used this cream during my first pregnancy and got no stretch marks.  I am using it again and love it!</li>
    <li> I have been on this cream for 2 months and do not see any result. Might be good as prevention cream...</li>
    <li> The worst smell ever, I can&#x27;t pass that. Plus it&#x27;s not greasy but leaves weird feeling, like my skin doesn&#x27;t breath. Palmer&#x27;s olive and shea butter are so much better.</li>
    <li> I used this religiously my entire pregnancy and got NO stretch marks on my belly. I got a few on my breasts, but I think that was more from breastfeeding, and I doubt that anything would have helped. I didn&#x27;t use this on my breasts after I gave birth because I didn&#x27;t want my baby to ingest the lotion. So I don&#x27;t know if it would have worked there.     Stretch marks are also caused by dehydration, so I was really careful to drink tons of water, at least 10 glasses per day. I used this cream every day, and after every shower. Towards the end, my belly was itching like crazy and this was the only thing that would soothe it, since I was afraid to use anything like a cortisone cream. In my 8th and 9th month, I carried a tub in my purse and put it on all day long.    This really worked for me. I think that if you use it every day, and drink lots of water, you can avoid getting most stretch marks. That&#x27;s not to say you won&#x27;t get a few, but you can probably avoid those really dark purple ones that leave deep scars. I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I have been using it for around two weeks, but my white stretchmarks are much less noticeable.  I don&#x27;t know how well it works for severe stretchmarks, and mine are very light, but they will help conceal the light kind.  It smells nice and is affordable.  Again, I dont have the red and purple marks, but for those with paler stretchmarks, this is a dream cream.  It works even better on my breasts, which got very pale stretch marks after my pregnancy.  Highly recommended for before birth and after.  Ladies, I would start using various stretchmark and bust firming creams at puberty.  An ounce of prevention...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was 7 months pregnant and it&#x27;s been about 6 months and I have seen results but it&#x27;s very little. This product works but has taken atleast 4 months to show any results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when I was in H.S. because I had stretch marks, light white ones, on the back of my knees. However, years later I noticed I had stretch marks, light pink ones, on my sides.  I still had the same bottle so I decided to use it.  Well, I love it.  I never really used it before.  But now that I am getting ready for a vacation in May, I thought I should be using it because I lost some weight and now I have the marks.  I believe it really does work.  My marks are much, much lighter and some are barely visible at all.  I use it twice a day, everyday, and for about a week now. Great results.</li>
    <li> Used every single day, twice a day throughout my pregnancy and it didn&#x27;t work.  I used the cream to prevent stretch marks since I didn&#x27;t have any previous to getting pregnant.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am 5 months pregnant and just became educated on ingredients in the products I have been applying to my hair and skin. So often we don&#x27;t think past the food we are ingesting when we worry about chemicals. This product contains at least 4 ingredients (PEG-8, Yellow 5, Propylparaben, methylparaben) that are known carcinogens, can effect your liver and kidneys and endocrine systems. Remember, if it can effect your body it can effect you baby. [...] I have been using a product called Belli Elasticity Belly Oil that has all natural ingredients. I got it on [...] and it may be spendy but I love the way it makes my skin feel. I will continue to use the Belli products even after my baby is born!</li>
    <li> I am pregnant for the first time and very concerned about getting stretch marks. I&#x27;ve used many different Palmers products in the past so choosing the stretch formula was a no brainer. Day one of use and I&#x27;m fighting nausea all day due to the smell of this stuff. While not an unpleasant smell, it is VERY strong and did not ease all day. This product smells even stronger to me then the regular cocoa butter products and my husband agreed, it wasn&#x27;t my pregnant sensitive nose. This makes no sense to me that a product marketed for pregnant women would have such a strong aroma instead of being odorless. I cannot say whether or not this is a good product because I can wear it, but beware expectant moms sniff before purchasing.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this brand of cosmetic products. It is really great for reducing stretch marks and preventingthe way they look. The smell isn&#x27;t that great, and the consistency of the cream is not so liquid: people seem to like it like that, but unless you are an expert applying cream to large portions of your body, it means that you need to use more of it. Skin seems to absorbe it really well, though.</li>
    <li> I was so happy with this product that have recommended to all of my future mom friends. We all agree that is an excellent product for preventing stretch marks and having a really soft skin.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended by my OBGYN and after having used it for a few weeks after birth, I noticed that it did subdue stretch marks quite a bit. It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of them, but it makes them far less visible I guess. Tried a few other products top but this one has worked best so far. It also helps reduce itching in the area.</li>
    <li> I was pregnant with my first child &amp; used this product religiously with no results.  I am now treating extensive stretch marks that this product failed to help prevent.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff twice daily since the moment I found out I was pregnant until I gave birth. My stomach got COMPLETELY covered in stretch marks...worse than I&#x27;ve ever seen. And for some reason I kept using it!! There are plenty of women that gain 70lbs when they&#x27;re pregnant and don&#x27;t get a single stretch mark because of their genes, not a lotion. The girls this \\&quot;worked\\&quot; for wouldn&#x27;t have gotten stretch marks whether they used the cream or not I can guarantee that. Otherwise it would have done SOMETHING for me. Total letdown</li>
    <li> Excellent handling and shipping!  I was amazed of the quality of the package I received!    Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because I was looking for a stretchmark cream that wasn&#x27;t too expensive and had decent reviews. I used this product religiously and slathered it on my belly twice a day for 8 months... the smell of the cream is awful but I ignored it thinking it would prevent stretchmarks. Well, I was disappointed when in my 7th month of pregnancy I got a TON of STRETCHMARKS. My doctor told me that stretchmarks are ultimately determined by your genetics and there is no product out there that can completely PREVENT stretchmarks b/c it depends on the elasticity of your skin. I also read in a book that the skin breaks from underneath vs. creams that only treat topical skin.</li>
    <li> I started using this the moment i found out i was pregnant. I used it 2x at least a day and it did nothing for me at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money thinking this will prevent stretch marks!</li>
    <li> WHEN I WAS PREGNANT I  DIDNT GET ANY STRETCH MARKS ON MY BELLY!! I USED THIS PRODUCT TWICE A DAY EVERYDAY &amp; IT DEFINATELY DID WORK FOR ME!!  MAKE SURE YOU USE A LOT.  STAY HYDRATED AS WELL MAKE SURE YOU DRINK A LOT OF WATER.</li>
    <li> What everyone says is correct, stretch marks are based off of genetics. If you have ANY from puberty, you will likely get some in pregnancy. I am 24 years old and this is my third pregnancy. I am 8.5 months right now and I like this cream. I have the silver stretch marks on my hips from puberty that got worse when I was pregnant with my 2nd. A little bit of red at the top of them, and some got wider. At night I turn on the shower and steam up my bathroom. I sit there for 10 min or so so my pores are opened up. I use Palmers skin therapy oil first and then this stuff. In the morning after I shower I just use the lotion. My skin always feels creamy soft and I have only gotten 2 small stretch marks this pregnancy. If your skin isn&#x27;t moisturized, you r skin will rip more. I honestly believe that this stuff helps a bit.</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonderfully for me not sure if i just got lucky and have super elastic skin or if it actually worked but i used this product twice a day for my entire pregnancy and thus far being exactly 2 weeks from my due date have not recieved a single stretch mark NOT ONE. Hopefully i stay this way i&#x27;m in the home stretch!..I was 92 lbs. before i got pregnant and now weigh 119 lbs. So i have gained a significant amount for my size. Highly refer this product...the only thing i hate is the smell and the fact that ive gone through about six bottles and the pump has not worked on 5 of them.</li>
    <li> This is my first pregnancy and I&#x27;ve been using this cream almost every night since I started to show . I&#x27;m now 27 weeks and so far NO STRETCH MARKS!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m in my 37 week of the pregnancy and so far no single stretch mark. If that&#x27;s due to the cream or to my genetic I cannot say, but what is for sure is that my skin feels hydrated and elastic and I&#x27;m not having belly itching either.   I used it twice a day, morning and night.     ps: if any marks appear before the birth of my baby I&#x27;ll change the review :-)</li>
    <li> I lost about 30 pounds recently and had ugly stretch marks all over. Just within 2 days of using this product, I saw a significant difference on my body. I am a black woman with medium skin tone, and my skin rarely responds to all these products. However I was really amazed with this product. The marks faded away in just 2 days, I have now finished the whole bottle and will no doubt buy a 2nd one. Please note that the marks do not go away completely, however their appearance is significantly reduced.</li>
    <li> the last order was for a palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter lotion that i saw advertised on TV. My Fiancee just had a baby and she wanted to get rid of few marks.  I am very satisfied with the product and the order was received right within the scheduled time.    thanks amazon      carlton</li>
    <li> I have used this cream throughout my entire first pregnancy. I used it as directed, every day and I didn&#x27;t get a single stretchmark. I was very skinny before my pregnancy and my tummy was very flat so it stretched quite a bit during pregnancy. I was very pleased to not have one single stretchmark on my belly thanks to this cream. I am currently pregnant with my second child and using it again.   I would (and did) definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> my pregnant wife says it&#x27;s good. smells like cocoa because it&#x27; cocoa butter i guess. it&#x27;s not stick so it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I used this along with parmers tommy butter and lotion when I was pregnant. I like this cream better than lotion, I feel like it offers good coverage. I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks thanks to this product.This worked great for me.</li>
    <li> bought this product for a month now and use it to fade away my facial scars after a week I atarted noticing them fading away thats when some of my friends noticed it too so i believe this product has helped me fade scars ive had for years anyhow it didnt completely fade them but the product made my skin softer and my scars noticibly faded great product been using this product ever since</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I was pregnant with my daughter. I used it daily on my belly, breasts, and underarms but still got tons of stretch marks. I continued using it for a year after my pregnancy and never saw any results. My stretch marks are still here with no lessening. The smells is yummy, and it makes your skin very soft, but I wish it actually made the stretch marks go away.</li>
    <li> I recently had a baby and used a different product during my pregnancy only ended up with two stretch marks on my belly. I received this as trial when i bought two nursing bras and decided to try it. I have only been using it for a few days and i see a MAJOR difference in the lightness my stretchmarks. It also makes them smaller in appearance and has helped to make them not look so wrinkly. I will use this after my next baby for sure. :)</li>
    <li> I just started to use th this, so far I like the feel of this lotion. I have heard a lot about this product and decided to try it.</li>
    <li> I am currently 9 months pregnant and I have tried EVERYTHING from Mama Mio Tummy Rub and Bio Oil, to Gold Bond Medicated, and Coco Butter  - and ladies, listen to me - if your skin is prone to stretch marks, and your mama had them, you&#x27;re going to get them. NO MATTER WHAT. This was extremely disheartening for me, because I was lathering up several times a day, every single day, but once my 8th month rolled around, I got HUGE and the stretch marks started to appear. Now what I will tell you, is that had I not done everything I did to prevent them, they would certainly be much worse than they are right now... and of all the products I used, it was this product and Bio Oil that worked the best for me. This product smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy, and helps relieve the itch right away, it has also helped keep my stretch marks very light in color - so I know they are not deep and not as severe as they could be. I also have full confidence that it will help to fade them after I give birth. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I got pregnant I gained 70 pounds (I know...)  Long story short, I put this on my belly religiously everyday as soon as I started to show (around 10-12 weeks).  I used it the entire pregnancy and I never got one single stretch mark on my stomach (and it was huge).  I know it was the cream because I got stretch marks everywhere else that I didn&#x27;t use the cream (breasts, thighs, hips, buttocks, etc.).  Stupidly, I only thought of the belly as an area to worry about. (I guess if you don&#x27;t gain 70 pounds it&#x27;s no big deal!)   Anyway, my skin on my stomach is completely flawless but everywhere else is a nightmare!  Do yourself a favor and put this on everyday.  Also, learn from my mistake and put it on all the areas that will grow!      My daughter is 8 months old and I&#x27;m looking for a way to get rid of the marks on my thighs, etc.  I read that the Palmer&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work that great for existing marks but I am going to try it and see what happens.  I know it is the only thing that saved my stomach!</li>
    <li> I started using this last night, and the difference in my stretch marks over night are amazing. I got stretch marks from rapid weight gain, but now theyre going away just like my weight. Ill be back to normal in no time!</li>
    <li> I dont know. It was kind of expensive and I used it for about 2 weeks straight, no real results and made my back break out pretty bad</li>
    <li> I used this product faithfully and saw no results.  It doesnt work well for stretch marks that are old and highly doubt if they will work for new ones as well, save your money!!!</li>
    <li> i use this product with the firming one. it has helped this appearance of stretch marks but not as much and as fast as i would. maybe because i should have used this before i started getting them. you just have to be on it with applying the cream twice a day for results.</li>
    <li> This lotion claims to reduce the appearance of stretch marks and this is not true. It smells great and moisturizes well but it DOES NOT reduce stretch marks. I recently had my first child and have been using this product since my third trimester when stretch marks began to form and have not seen any change in the stretch marks while using this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, but the lotion is thick and helps with the stretch marks I already have. I&#x27;m on my second child and have been using this lotion and bio oil right after i shower. I don&#x27;t get to apply it 2x a day like you&#x27;re suppose to, to save money &amp; product but it works either way! It came through the mail in good timing and the product was well worth it!</li>
    <li> There are endless belly creams out there that target pregnant women and tell them that the cream will prevent or reduce stretch marks. I am sorry to tell you that stretch marks are caused by how old you are, how elastic your skin is, how big your baby is, and maybe some genetic factors. If you are prone to stretch marks, and if you are carrying a big load, you are probably going to get stretch marks no matter how many expensive creams you slather on your bump. So I wasn&#x27;t prepared to shell out big bucks for stretch mark cream, because I am skeptical that stretch marks can really be prevented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I still wanted to use some type of cream. Palmer&#x27;s cream is inexpensive, thick and creamy, and it smells great (assuming you like the coconutty smell of cocoa butter, which I do). I rubbed it on my baby bump almost every day during the third trimester. I didn&#x27;t need to use much to cover my whole belly, so the tube lasted for quite a while.  In some cases, I mixed in a few drops of vitamin E oil which is also good for the skin. It was a good way to pamper myself and to spend a little time with my tummy. I am sure the baby appreciated the massage as well. For the record, I had minimal stretch marks compared to those I have seen on other women, but I had a small baby and an early delivery, so that probably helped. Like I said above, I think that stretch marks are unavoidable in some cases! They are the proud marks of motherhood!</li>
    <li> Using a circular motion gently apply Palmer&#x27;s Massage Cream for Stretch Marks to Tummy, Hips, Thighs, Bust and other areas prone to stretch marks.</li>
    <li> i love this cream i hope it still works for my last months of pregnancy since those months are the ones where the belly stretches more</li>
    <li> I tried 4 different products and THIS is the ONLY one that actually healed my skin AND gave me relief form itchy belly! A MUST have if in your 3rd trimester!</li>
    <li> Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;No stretch marks after twins.&lt;br /&gt;Could be genetics or this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Either way its probably good for your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just 15 weeks pregnant and I bought this product about week ago. And it smells amazing!!!! Girls if you don&#x27;t like sweet scents, just don&#x27;t buy it! But don&#x27;t tell to everybody that it smells horrible! And I like the texture of it, so so good, not greasy at all. So I hope this product will work for me.</li>
    <li> My review is simple: My wife has given birth to two kids and used this cream on each pregnancy. She got NO stretch marks. It works on her. Period.  I was told by a post mortem nurse though, that this kind of anti-stretch mark ointment has a better effect on Asian women than Caucasian ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week now...applying it at least 3 times a day and I&#x27;m already seeing a difference. my red stretch marks are already looking lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pleased so far!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the cream consistently so I haven&#x27;t seen any results, but I am still hopeful. It does leave a sort of greasy residue but it doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Smell good!</li>
    <li> I like using this as a regular lotion because it&#x27;s super moisturizing and the smell is great. I can&#x27;t really say for stretch marks though because I haven&#x27;t experimented.</li>
    <li> This cream smells so good, and feels so nice on my skin, that I use it where I don&#x27;t have stretch marks. I had originally purchased this cream during my first pregnancy to avoid stretch marks. I&#x27;m not saying the cream worked (it may just be my genetics) but I haven&#x27;t gotten a single stretch mark in any of my three pregnancies. I am not currently pregnant but still use this cream because I love smelling like chocolate :)</li>
    <li> It works - no stretch marks on my belly after two pregnancies. I never used a different product, because this one worked for me. All that one needs to do is just following the instructions and be persistent.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a pregnant friend and she said it worked well.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t ever use Palmers again. It claims to be parable free on all their products. This is false advertisement. They hide their paraben in the ingredient form called PEG. Please do your own research for the safety of yourself and your kids.</li>
    <li> This cream smells awful!  It&#x27;s the worst cloying sweet smell ever. I have no idea if it even works. I can&#x27;t stand to have this product in my house.  Ugh.</li>
</ol>
