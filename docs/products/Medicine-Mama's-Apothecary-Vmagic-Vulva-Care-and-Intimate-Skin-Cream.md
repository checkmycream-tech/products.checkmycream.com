<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not often write reviews, but this product is every bit as good as it claims to be.  I am post-menopausal and was having a severe problem with dryness and pain.  I&#x27;m happy to say that this cream has worked wonders.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, works for a number of things and parts of the body.</li>
    <li> I am so sensitive and have had tons of trouble with lady issues. This stuff is the best ever!  I use it every day to sooth and will stick with it.</li>
    <li> Best personal care product ever. I have been without any irritations or discomfort since introducing Vmagic into my daily skin care regimen. I use it EVERYWHERE as it immediately moisturizes and vanishes whatever is going on.  Seriously, from shave rash, to redness or burning, I am amazed at the quick results of how it calms and heals. And the fact that there is nothing allergenic in it makes it even better. I am totally in support of using only mild-formulated all natural products in areas that are prone to irritations... like feminine skin zones. The ingredients in every other product I have used is \\&quot;almost\\&quot; all natural. Vmagic is the real deal. I totally recommend this product to women of all ages.</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money!! It is magic in a container!! Will definitely buy more in future!!</li>
    <li> This cream really soothes and moisturizers well. I recommend it for people who wax. It helps prevent chaffing.</li>
    <li> So thankful for this product. It is soothing! I did a pH test on it as I have been avoiding alkaline soaps because of how they can dry out the skin and damage the  natural layer of fatty acids that is called the acid mantle barrier. It isn&#x27;t alkaline. I also looked up each of the ingredients and was encouraged by what I read. I got halfway through the jar and ordered two more so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Very good intimate skin cream that soothes rashes and irritated skin in delicate areas. No smell and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m very happy with it and don&#x27;t have to use it often but when I do, it works wonderfully and my skin is usually back to normal within a day or two of using.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and soothing. Seems to to be excellent for not only intimate areas, but also for other dry skin problems. I love that is made of natural ingredients. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products and this is by far the best product I have found.  It really does heal the dry tissue and relieves the pain and even itching in the process.  I suffer with dryness, itching and recurrent infections because the skin is so thin and vulnerable.  I hope one day to resume a normal sex life and am in my late 50&#x27;s.  I have tried luvena prebiotic inserts which are wonderful in combination with the v-Magic, and I have used the V-magic internally as well, and it doesn&#x27;t cause me any issues.  I also use vitamin E suppositories which help way better than the candida treatment suppositories which tend to dry out the tissue.  If you only use one product, except for estrogen cream, v-magic is the best!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never stop buying this product! It&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin and after shaving. I always put some on before bef for the best results.</li>
    <li> This stuff gives incredible and unprecedented relief for dry skin.  So great to have a natural product that can be used whenever with the only consequence being relief!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to come across this product because it is a natural alternative to lubricant products out there. I had no  idea it existed. I feel way better about using V Magic because it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of junk in it and it really works!!!! I&#x27;ve told a few close friends about it and now they use it and love it. I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my gyn doctor.  Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> Works.  Ends the horrible discomfort I&#x27;ve been experiencing, no mess, and can be used on other areas, although I&#x27;ll save it for the &#x27;important&#x27; parts.</li>
    <li> My husband just loves that I got Vmagic.  I am saying yes again...</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, prone to irritation! I am willing to pay a little more for a higher quality product which is the risk I took with this product and it paid off! I definitely find this product to be superior to other products that serve the same purpose.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Great!!!!!  It really helps w/dryness.  I must have if your going through menopause!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended! This product is soothing, organic and just wonderful. I have been using on many different parts on my body, but if you moisture, lube, or relieve burning, or itching on your lady parts this product is fantastic!  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to many ingredients but this stuff is wonderful!  Especially feels great after shaving or when the skin needs a little extra softness. Buy! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I have searched for a cream with natural ingredients that is gentle for sensitive areas. That provides  relief from the irritation of dryness. Since I have had my hysterectomy, I have had some tremendous dryness. This product works like a charm and instantly to bring comfort especially as I work lon hours on my job. It has made a world  of difference. So grateful for this product. It is surely  a main stay for me.</li>
    <li> cheap vaseline does same</li>
    <li> It good. It works. would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome! started working right away......</li>
    <li> After reading all of the wonderful reviews I figured I would go ahead and try the product but after the first application it caused irritation and redness.  I had to use another ointment to relieve the pain that this one cause me.  I will not be using this product again.</li>
    <li> Best cream EVER for post-menopausal vulva dryness and irritation!  I have tried many, many creams for relief of post-menopausal vulva dryness, irritation, itching and discomfort, but none have worked until I started using V Magic.  With the first application, I got complete relief from these symptoms.  This cream is so effective that one application a day is enough to prevent dryness, irritation, itching and stinging.  V Magic has only all natural organic ingredients, with no irritating preservatives or perfumes.  My skin is super sensitive, and this is the only product that I have used that calms all my symptoms, without any irritants in the product.  I had given up hope of finding any product that would work for me, but I just prayed that there was something out there that would work.  So I searched Amazon and found MedicineMama&#x27;s Apothecary VMagic Vulva Care.  I will be ordering a half dozen jars to be sure that I never have to go without this product. A big plus is that it&#x27;s made in the USA!  Hope this review helps other sufferers.  Before finding VMagic cream, we had a whole house water filter installed and a shower wand with a filter, in an attempt to remove all chlorine from our water.  Chlorine is a known skin irritant.  While this helped, it didn&#x27;t alleviate my symptoms.  My symptoms were so bad that it even hurt to sit.  But, thanks to VMagic, my skin is totally pain free.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I purchased this for its stated purpose but soon used it for so much more.  It works great for the V and surrounding areas.  I also use it daily on my lips under balm and around my eyes over moisturizer.  I have used it inside my nose when it was chapped from a cold.  I used it on eczema on my ears.  My sensitive skin loves it.</li>
    <li> I found this a very nice product for sensitive, delicate skin. This is especially soothing to just waxed/shaved skin.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to this area due to some medication.  it left me with marks like a razor burn.  The first time I put this on it really soothed.  Hopefully I will be rid of this problem before I use up the bottle.</li>
    <li> Very nice product for females for healing n moisterizing as well as helps with itching. I highly recommend. Jus us as needed</li>
    <li> This stuff is not only great for the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; but any dry skin patches.</li>
    <li> Great price, quality, and service.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this cream after experiencing some irritation that seemed to be hormone related and not anything super concerning, like a yeast infection. It is exactly what it says, it&#x27;s a moisturizer for the almighty V. Perimenopausal women may find that things in the vulvar area are not as as moist and pliable as they once were. This dryness can result in irritation and may also be more noticeable during intimate moments. It&#x27;s, thankfully, not a frequent issue for me yet but I have noticed some changes that are not making me happy so I decided to try this out. It works well for razor burn and irritation, too. It is very gentle, non-stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not exactly say it&#x27;s scent free, it has a scent... not really a pleasant one, either. I am sure there are no added fragrance, just the natural eua de Vmagic. It&#x27;s an acquired scent, I suppose.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST. HELPS WITH THE FEMALE PROBLEMS OF ITCHING AND IRRITATION I&#x27;VE HAD SINCE HYSTERECTOMY. STARTED WORKING FOR ME AFTER A FEW APPLICATIONS. I ORDERED IT FOR THE CHEMICAL FREE PART BUT NOW THAT IT REALLY DOES WHAT IT SAYS I&#x27;M GLAD I FOUND THIS. FOR ME IT WORKS BETTER THAN THE PRESCIPTION MEDICINE AND OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINES I&#x27;VE TRIED. I WILL ORDER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Very good cream-really works well!  I&#x27;ve tried man and this is the first that really works!</li>
    <li> Great product, reasonably priced, and efficient shipping.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have very sensitive skin in this area which is dry due to menopause, and this works really well with no sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> This highly emollient and healing cream is just what I was looking for.  It contains no hormones or harsh chemicals that other creams including the prescription ones contain and it works just as well or better for me.  I have found this product to be a very satisfactory solution to what used to be a very annoying problem.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and soothing product.  I have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t &#x27;t react to this at all.  Bit expensive - there might be other things that do the job more cheaply.</li>
    <li> I was searching for an alternative to the exhorbitantly-priced hormone cream that comes with health warnings that my doctor prescribed for external dryness and itching.  I tried another natural product a few years ago without success.  Drugstore products all have undesirable ingredients, so I took a chance on V Magic, and I’m very pleased with the results.  I’ve used about 1/8 teaspoon nightly for one week and I’ve had no itching or discomfort from the first application.  This is not only a great product, but I can purchase three 2 oz jars of V Magic for the amount of the co-pay for one 1 oz tube of the prescription cream.  I’m happy not to be lining the pockets of the pharmaceutical company as well.  Plus, I have no concerns about the ingredients as I did with the prescription cream.</li>
    <li> Works well with the sore skin and soothing too.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product did help with irritation the first few times I used it.  But I did acquire some sort of allergy or sensitivity to the product.  Doesn&#x27;t make sense considering the ingredients, but I&#x27;m sure of it after several times. I was glad I had a strong steroid creme on hand to help with the rash.  I&#x27;m happy to continue to use as a body lotion to finish it up but won&#x27;t be re-ordering.  I appears to be a quality product for those who can use it.</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with vaginismus and doctors prescribed all kinds of ointments and medication to calm and relax the pelvic muscles that are spazzing.  I was using Neogyn and I absolutely loved it but it was extremely expensive for my college student budget.  When researching for different alternatives, this was the one that came as the most reccommended by Ob-gyno doctors and vaginal disorder patients.  V-Magic has organic ingredients, comes in a decent amount, and for half the price of Neogyn.  So I thought it didn&#x27;t hurt to try and when I used it, it was like giving a hug to someone who had the worst day.  The smell wasn&#x27;t empowering and had a sweet honey scent with a waxy feel.  I apply at least 2-4 times a day depending on the pain or irritation level.  I have no allergy reactions and I can go about my day without irritation.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> One of the many downsize of aging, body dryness. My OB-GYN recommended this cream and it really works. The itchiness and dryness are gone. It is pricey but to get rid of the discomfort well worth the price. It makes growing old a bit easier.</li>
    <li> I truly hope that this product does help others because this is an important issue.  Really wanted this product to work for my wife but she had a reaction to it.  She is highly sensitive to everything though.</li>
    <li> i have found this product works wonders for an often time neglected highly sensitive  area, Thanks Medicine Mama for your V care</li>
    <li> Use it for everything. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Used this as an alternative, to hormone cream, for dryness. Works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I put it on my hands at night. I used to have horribly dry and cracked looking hands. This has made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff saved me a trip to the doctor, which is exactly why I tried it. I was having a pain that felt like a sand burr when I touched the sensitive area.  I had tried otc cortisone cream and it didn&#x27;t help. I am post menopausal and thought it was from dryness. Anyway, it worked for me, whatever the problem was, it is gone!</li>
    <li> Just got this Vmagic just three day ago used it, hope it would help with my itching, stinging,  and burning of the vulva area at night and sometimes in the day which I have a problem for three years (3)Thought I would try this cream since I had tried anything from expensive creams, over the counter remedities to prescriptions (ointment ,powder) from my general primary doctor. And must seek out another dermotogist. Thinking about asking for a refund. Lousy product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for couple of years now and absolutely LOVE it! I truly and highly recommend it!!!! The texture is perfect and it&#x27;s multipurpose and very soothing. But actually my favorite thing about it is that it feels and smells very natural (pretty much odorless) unlike other intimate natural creams that have flowery and even food-like smells (cacao butter, coconut, vanilla, lavender.. just can&#x27;t take it..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 starts but- I used to by it at the local Co-op and it came in a glass container. The one I got from Amazon, though shown in the glass container, came in a plastic one. I personally prefer the glass though some people might not mind the unexpected change. I kept the one I got online but next time I will check the local store for the original packaging.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a gynecologist. This is very soothing and does its job well for particularly irritated area. Would highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> After many months of dryness, itching, and burning in the vulva area,  I discovered this wonderful product!  I tried everything, some maybe not being the best thing to use in that area, but I was in need of relief.  My doctor said use Vaseline, which I did, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do the trick.  I actually went to Amazon to purchase the cream advertised on tv, neogyn, or some name like that, and after reading the reviews, knew I couldn&#x27;t spend that much money on a product with such poor reviews.  I stumbled across VMagic by accident and after reading the reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  Not to mention that it, at the time, it didn&#x27;t cost that much.  After using it for about 4 days, I realized that it was actually working!  What a blessing!  I am a loyal fan of this product and am ordering another jar today.  In spite of what some reviews said, I didn&#x27;t detect a bad smell.  It will last for a couple of months if you don&#x27;t overdo it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my body.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible. Will use as a hand lotion maybe. It is greasy so I am sure it works.</li>
    <li> This product has vastly improved my issues with dryness and discomfort and it&#x27;s not messy like other products I have tried.  It does not stain your undergarments and it&#x27;s easy to apply.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. I bought two more containers. I&#x27;m not leaving home without it.</li>
    <li> very soothing to the skin down there</li>
    <li> Excellent product -was recommended by a woman I know - great for irritation of the vulva area.</li>
    <li> I like using natural products so this one is great.  I put it on dry skin and it never burns or irritates.</li>
    <li> I am quite young for an interest in this product it seems, however i&#x27;ve had (perhaps TMI, but...) dry patches in certain areas that were not very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for this reason, and it was ok - did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to love the product when I somehow contracted symptoms of blepharitis around my eyes. Imagine that wind-whipped sensation of being outdoors in freezing blustery weather. It is like a never ending freezing windstorm on and around your eyelids. (In all actuality, it is probably exactly like what the vmagic is meant to treat...)  The skin became so irritated, it burned and would remain practically like leather despite my attempts of applying vitamin e, retinol cream, primrose oil.&lt;br /&gt;My best moisturizers didnt stand a chance against the horrible condition. They sat atop my eyelid and would not absorb. THEN, just about at the end of my wits I remembered I had this in my drawer. I applied it after double checking the ingredients (which are all organic and minimal) and immediately my skin showed the slightest yielding from gross dry tautness, and was slowly absorbed. Now I&#x27;m not saying it completely healed the condition, but it sure helps more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doing wonderful things for me. I really like this.</li>
    <li> Love this product, really works.</li>
    <li> great ointment however it has a strong odor of some kind but ok</li>
    <li> the cream is the best I have used</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it just didn&#x27;t work. At first there was a little less itching but after a couple times it just didn&#x27;t stop the itching.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend just received this today and she absolutely loves it....GREAT PRODUCT!!!!1</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it at night after washing my face.  My skin is dry.  This product has eased that immensely.  I am happy I found this.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I had a horrible yeast infection that left me very uncomfortable, even after it cleared.  One day of Vmagic, and I was feeling SO much better.  Well worth the price.  I am using it every day, and I will definitely continue use.</li>
    <li> This product has a variety of uses, all of which are very effective. I don&#x27;t understand the poor review(s). The product is high quality and all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It erases razor burn and razor bumps within a few hours, and the soothing effect was immediate. Can be applied after waxing for soothing effect as well! Also helps with ingrown hairs that have become inflamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for use after intimacy, as friction can leave sensitive skin irritated. Soothes and has antibacterial properties, great if you can&#x27;t shower immediately after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for use during intimacy, natural and organic lubricant. Much better than sticky, fake fruity smelling lubricant that&#x27;s full of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend, ladies. So give it a try!</li>
    <li> Finally found something that relieves my issues without any bad ingredients.</li>
    <li> Great for that down south dryness!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. From irritation to razor burn, this is a cure-all for me. I recently had a cold soar on my lip, so i put V Magic on it consistently for one whole day. You would not believe how quickly it healed! I recommend this to all my ladies!</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected</li>
    <li> Love it!  Helps with dryness, irritation and sensitivity.  Also great for dry feet as well</li>
    <li> Very good product. It stands up to what they advertise.</li>
    <li> Oh my gf swears by this. and BONUS sometimes she asks me to apply it!</li>
    <li> Really like the ingredients in it and wish I could use it....However, it caused a big bad rash on my son. Now have to throw it away.</li>
    <li> I developed an external vaginal yeast infection from this product somehow.  I got it specifically to calm irritation after wiping.</li>
    <li> This stuff truly is magic for women over 60 like me!  V Magic is all natural and a great lubricant.</li>
    <li> I was embarrassed to buy this because I&#x27;m only 30 and most of the reviews are written by women in their sixties. But I love the product.  I had been having some issues with irritation in that area for almost a week.  I ordered this and within 24 hours after use I saw improvements and by 48 hours everything was back to normal. It contains all natural ingredients so the smell is not &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; but the product is effective. The smell is only noticeable when first applied.  I have added this to my daily body care routine. Totally worth the $25!</li>
    <li> Very soothing product.</li>
    <li> What relief!  Any time.  I have 3 jars on hand.  Don&#x27;t want to be without at my age.</li>
    <li> A little embarrassing for me to write a review on such an intimate product but I&#x27;m so pleased with it that I wanted to pass it on. Works very well to prevent and treat symptoms of irritation during and after sex.  I found since pre-menopause has begun that things have changed and this product really has made all the difference in keeping intimacy going.  That it is made up of all natural ingredients and is so gentle on the skin is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product is great will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Does the job, great for,post menopause women !</li>
    <li> Women in their 50s and 60s know that sex can be painful.  VMagic is the perfect natural lubricant to solve this problem, and it also soothes any irritation afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I feel safe using it as all ingredients are natural.  Now I use it on my lips, hands, and feet.  My husband has put VMagic on his cracked heels and on a recovering cut.  My arms were scratched and itchy after yard work; again, VMagic helped them feel better immediately.  This is a wonderful, multi-use product, a natural substitute for vaseline and many other products with chemicals and artificial scents.  The ingredients must enhance the skin&#x27;s natural healing properties in some way. I recommend this product 100%; it is totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is my second jar of this. I love it. It is really soothing after shaving. It prevents chaffing. More soothing and healing than coconut or olive oil alone. LOVE, LOVE this. I think it may help tone also...</li>
    <li> amazing,anyone with a dry problem should try it, i have tried a million products this one works, my husband is elated</li>
    <li> Works very well...it was a true godsend.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews before making this purchase and I must say I will never be without this product.  I am a 60 year old woman who has definitely suffered from feminine dryness but no more!!</li>
    <li> I have noticed as I have aged that the skin &#x27;down there&#x27; is more delicate and prone to inflammation. This has helped. I only use this once per day-usually after a shower. I have found it to be soothing and have only used it externally so I cannot comment on its efficacy as a lubricant during sex. I would probably use one that is latex friendly if you are still using a diaphragm or condoms. I have not noticed any smell that I can comment on. It has  a light odor (to my nose). I recommend if you are going the natural products route. I also use their Bee Magic line for my feet. It is the only thing that helps the dry feet I have now.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  No burning and no mess.  Works perfect.  A friend suggested it and I am so happy with this product.  It&#x27;s embarassing to need but this is the only way to go if you need it!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few years now, it is by far the best lubricant we have ever used.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my gynecologist and works very well at calming irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Ladies... we have all tried products in the past, But this one actually works.  V Magic treats and soothes issues with discomfort, dryness, and pain.  I ordered thinking, well I will try another one.  When this product arrived at my home, I used immediately and within 20 minutes felt soothing relief like never before.... It was like real magic.  All natural, and you need just a little dab.  Will definitely reorder when needed and look forward to trying some of Medicine Mama&#x27;s other products.  Looks like a really good company.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Healed my problem in 2 days. I had tried unsuccessfully ,with other treatments, and got no improved result. .</li>
    <li> This works wonderful.  I know what it&#x27;s made for, and bought it for that, HOWEVER, I also used it on my shins which has had dry, patchy, scaley spots that the dermatologist could do nothing about.  This very soft, jelly like salve healed my shins!! It took a couple weeks of daily application, but they look better than they have in years.  2 thumbs up for VMagic!  I used it a bit on my sun damaged forearms and it made them softer and younger looking.</li>
    <li> This salve is very soothing.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. Definatly worth the money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this ointment to relieve some irritation down there. Was expecting some form of relief, however, slight, within 24 hours.  It was basically USELESS.  Won&#x27;t be ordering in the future</li>
    <li> No better than xtra virgin coconut oil</li>
    <li> I used this for a long time before writing a review. I will say it is a good personal lubricant, natural, if you are used to other lubricants, it does not have the silicone &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; feel, it is more greasy. I actually found by accident that is is a fab eye cream! I also use this on scraps and cuts. But hands down the best eye cream (night time) I use. I have crepey eye skin and this is the only thing that helps it. I put it on before bed, and when I wake up, my eyes look great! I apply to upper lids and under eye also. Right now this is my HG night time eye cream.</li>
    <li> This wonderful product makes tissues feel young and supple. I got it to deal with an issue, but love to use it every day. It seems to infuse the area with love. The ingredients are pure and natural. The only complaint is my husband says it interferes with my personal fragrance.</li>
    <li> This product is truly outstanding!  I am over 65 and was constantly noticing that my v-area felt irritated, especially as the day wore on.  I tried several different products including Emerita and Aloe Life, both being gels that were a bit too liquidy, so I think most of their moisturizing properties ended up on my panties.  But this V-magic has a thick consistency that stays put.  I never feel like I have anything messy; it just does its job all day long and then I reapply at bedtime.  Doctors have no idea about any of these natural products --thank heavens for Amazon where we can discover them and help ourselves!!</li>
    <li> V Magic is something I just love.  Not only do I use it after shaving for the bumps and redness, but I also use it on my face.  For blemishes and eye makeup remover.  My skin is extremely senstive and V Magic is one of the only things that soothes my eczema.  Highly highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This was what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Soothes irritated sensitive skin fast, also works as a Pre-treatment and lubricant.</li>
    <li> This seems to work really well.</li>
    <li> Love this product, very wholesome for all the listed uses and great for healing.  It&#x27;s a natural product without harmful or harsh chemicals so perfect for every use!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know how i feel about this product. It is so so i use it when i shave or wax. it does help with the soothing..But i don&#x27;t see itbeing used as a lubricant? The Product is not magic though.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected,sticky</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
