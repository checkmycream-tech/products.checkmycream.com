      <li>pump is enough to cover my whole face and neck, and it has a nice, light scent.</li>
      <li>Skin looks and feels so soft, fills lines in, LOVE</li>
      <li>I had been using another serum before this one, but this is by far better suited for me.</li>
      <li>Gives skin a fresh firmer look.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference the first time I wore it, then ordered a full size, which was delivered on a Sunday - just in time because I was out of the sample.  </li>
      <li>After just the 1st use i feel like it absorbed right away &amp; smoothed out the lines.</li>
      <li>It is day eight right now</li>
      <li>i noticed a diffrence right away.</li>
      <li>My makeup is easier to apply and my makeup just blends right in.  </li>
      <li>and it makes my skin so smooth and soft!</li>
      <li>For my first use, I decided to use it in the morning, before applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes a noticeable difference in the first week.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It literally soaks into my skin and leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The texture is not really thick, but just right to moisturize without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>I can really notice some of my dark scars have faded and how bright and clear it makes my skin.</li>
      <li>My skin feels smoother and looks so much brighter, my husband even noticed.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a week now, and I am really liking the results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old and have recently decided to start taking better care of my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only just recently discovered Lumene and it&#x27;s had a huge impact on my skin!</li>
      <li>I wear it with a little blush on top as it makes my skin look like I have a foundation hiding any flaws.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing it twice a day, everyday for about 1month &amp; absolutely love the results.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to see that I can apply in the evening and in the morning!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I have a few fine lines under my eyes &amp; on my forehead.</li>
      <li>I apply it twice a day, directly after washing and before moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft and has helped in sun damage spots and over all tone correction.  </li>
      <li>I bought this at my local Ulta after some extensive research on naturally derived skincare.</li>
      <li>but the main thing is I really do not like the scent, which reminds me of deodorant spray).</li>
      <li>Sounds like other people like it so if you aren&#x27;t particular about scents this could work for you.</li>
      <li>only complaint is how difficult it is to get the full range of Lumene products here in the states - I&#x27;d love to try their makeup.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My skin loves this stuff. Lumene Bright Now Vitamin C absorbs easily and leaves my skin for smooth and soft. It like a matte finish. I wear it under my moisturizer and makeup. Even if I&#x27;m not wearing makeup, I just apply this with moisturizer. It smells amazing and a little goes a long way. I couldn&#x27;t find this in any store and I was glad to find it here at Amazon. I will continue to buy this amazing serum.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum I hv ever used....it makes the skin so soft,supple...it works better than a primer..it to evens out skin..best if used with a bb cream...</li>
    <li> Wonderful and inexpensive serum! Extremely silky feeling and  the scent is great</li>
    <li> I gave this serum a second chance after my first use, but it&#x27;s not good product. It creates a white film in your skin, and if you rub a little bit seems like dead skin. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> This one is a miracle.  I applied it over my moisturizer which is also Lumene.  I only applied a small &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34;.  It totally smoothed over my drooping under eye area, it smoothed my forehead lines and the rest of my face.  It gave me a glow even under my makeup.  It lasted all day.  Truly love this product.</li>
    <li> I love the weight and qualities of this serum. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product and I had to have it!!!  I love what this product does for my skin.  I have oily skin and apply this at night along with moisturizer for my eyes.  It&#x27;s a fabulous product.  I&#x27;ve only just recently discovered Lumene and it&#x27;s had a huge impact on my skin!</li>
    <li> i love this! i noticed a diffrence right away. it gave my face a glow, its silky and not at all greacy like other products. i will be buying more</li>
    <li> Can use all the help we can get. I wear it under foundation and find it to be light weight and nourishing to my face and neck.</li>
    <li> Best product! .... especially if used with hyaluronic acid. Gives skin a fresh firmer look. Love it! Works better than much pricier products.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  Skin looks and feels so soft, fills lines in, LOVE IT LOVE IT</li>
    <li> The cream feels so good on my face, and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I am 27 and have some fine lines coming in, this serum plumps up my lines and creates a smooth surface all over. It leaves my skin soft and has helped in sun damage spots and over all tone correction.  The scent is a light orange-citrus. I wear it with a little blush on top as it makes my skin look like I have a foundation hiding any flaws.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I received a sample &amp; was hooked.  It goes on smoothly &amp; smells great.  I noticed a difference the first time I wore it, then ordered a full size, which was delivered on a Sunday - just in time because I was out of the sample.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and can notice the brightness in my complexion.</li>
    <li> I Love it. It brightens up the skin !</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  I use this in summer alone and/or under makeup. It absorbs and does not leave skin oily at all and does not clog pores.  In cold and dry  weather, I use its sister--Lumene Nectar--which is a thicker product. A bonus for me---cruelty free!</li>
    <li> Love this cream !!! It works!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local Ulta after some extensive research on naturally derived skincare. My aim was to begin a preventative skin care regimen. I have been using this product for a week now, and I am really liking the results. In the space of two days I saw a difference in skin tone - my face is brighter and not as dull. In four days I noticed that my blemish scars were faded and my skin tone was evening. It is day eight right now and I went to work sans makeup, after the three day Fourth of July weekend. One coworker asked the name of my esthetician and if I had been to the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pump is enough to cover my whole face and neck, and it has a nice, light scent. It leaves my skin silky and is wearable under makeup. I apply it twice a day, directly after washing and before moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is how difficult it is to get the full range of Lumene products here in the states - I&#x27;d love to try their makeup.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle, i love it! i&#x27;m happy i found the right one with lower price! :-)</li>
    <li> I like this product but I can only use it on days when I&#x27;m staying home because I can&#x27;t incorporate it into my layering routine which includes 1-2 Vitamin C serums and SPF moisturizer and then makeup. Otherwise my makeup with &#x27;pill&#x27; and &#x27;bunch up&#x27; making me look like my face is peeling off. Just FYI if you layer several products.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I do not break out at all and it makes my skin so smooth and soft! I use it at night before my moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is a great item.  Works wonderfully as a pore minimizer under foundation.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just turned 65 have been using Lumene for about 3 yrs. To me this is the best i have found.. I don&#x27;t wear alot of makeup it is great alone with a little concealer and blush.  If I want to wear makeup I just mix a  little in my hand with this bb cream and it is perfect.  Try it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> Love! This serum actually works. It makes a noticeable difference in the first week. My skin feels smoother and looks so much brighter, my husband even noticed. I would recommend this to anyone. It gives a healthier, more youthful appearance and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I loveeee this moisturizer, this goes on so good and it&#x27;s non greasy. One of the best moisturizers out there!</li>
    <li> so perfect. skin looks perfect with this product</li>
    <li> This has a strong perfume smell that makes it inappropriate to use on the face (makes my eyes water a bit but the main thing is I really do not like the scent, which reminds me of deodorant spray). So, I&#x27;m using it for dry skin on my hands and feet and elbows and it&#x27;s a bit expensive for that.  Sounds like other people like it so if you aren&#x27;t particular about scents this could work for you.</li>
    <li> Great bb cream covers my hyper pigmentation.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I cannot find it in any stores. Thanks!</li>
    <li> When I was asked to review Bright Now Vitamin C BB Serum by Lumene, I quickly accepted.  At the time I tried the product, I had never tried a BB cream.  But I love the Lumene brand.  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.  As soon as I received the product, I quickly read the directions on how to apply. I was surprised to see that I can apply in the evening and in the morning! For my first use, I decided to use it in the morning, before applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bright Now Vitamin C BB Serum is colorless, so it does not add color to my face; it just leaves my skin looking smooth and even toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked after the first use! The serum is so silky and smooth on my skin. It literally soaks into my skin and leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth. My makeup is easier to apply and my makeup just blends right in.  Lumene is a fabulous brand and always has amazing products!  I received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I&#x27;m 20 years old and have recently decided to start taking better care of my skin. I have some mild scaring from hormonal acne and have combination normal/oily skin. I can really notice some of my dark scars have faded and how bright and clear it makes my skin. It&#x27;s less oily and it helps minimizes my pores, my skin feels softer not sticky or heavy. I use it after I wash my face with some kojic acid soap(which helps with dark scars), followed by toner, then the serum, then a moisturizer and finally some sunscreen. I had been using another serum before this one, but this is by far better suited for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream(serum) I have ever used.  It was excellent @$15 now its $25 but still the same excellent.  I use it with the BB tinted cream as my makeup.  People have told me I look in my 50&#x27;s.  My husband told me the other night that my face glowed and I looked about 22. :0)  I can&#x27;t give it up now can I?  :0)</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product, &amp; I love it! I have already recommended it to my friends. I have a few fine lines under my eyes &amp; on my forehead. After just the 1st use i feel like it absorbed right away &amp; smoothed out the lines. Its gives my face a slight glow. I have been wearing it twice a day, everyday for about 1month &amp; absolutely love the results. I just use 1 pump to my face &amp; neck, after I wash every morning &amp; night. The texture is not really thick, but just right to moisturize without feeling greasy. It also sits well under make up....i will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> 真的不错，下次还会考虑购买在，谢谢了！&lt;br /&gt;Really good, the next will consider buying in, thank you!</li>
