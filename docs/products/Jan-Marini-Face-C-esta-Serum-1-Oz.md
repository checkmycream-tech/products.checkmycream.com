<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Jan Marini products! I&#x27;ve been using the glycolic acid for years and it makes such a difference on lines and wrinkles and overall skin tone. I just tried C-esta and it&#x27;s so amazing the way it felt on my face, so smooth and it really feels like it soaks inside the skin. I highly recommend Jan Marini products, your skin will look better!</li>
    <li> love love love product. I think it is to expensive. Young ladies would purchace this product and I would suggest to most ladies to buy. Problem ... in this economy this is too expensive</li>
    <li> Beware...product came gritty had to return for refund. I believe it was defective or not as specified.</li>
    <li> Have have bought this product before through an esthetician and was skeptical about the difference in price buying through a second source on line.  Only difference I find is that the the expiration date on the serum is significantly shorter than the one purchased through my esthetician(6 months v. a year).</li>
    <li> I love the Jan Marini facial c-serum &amp; have used the product for many years. It goes on smooth &amp; gets rid of the dry skin feeling immediately. This product helps to keep my skin younger looking. I teach outside &amp; this product helps to protect my skin from the harmful effects of sun exposure. I get lots of compliments on how nice my skin is &amp; what my secret is &amp; always mention this product.    However, I don&#x27;t think that I can recommend this vendor (Amazon is good) but the actual vendor I ordered from has not been that good to deal with. The 1st container or dispenser did not work correctly &amp; they asked me to mail it back &amp; insure it with my own money. To me if they sent a defective product then they should back it up &amp; send me a return label to exchange it with. I am still waiting to here from them per my reply about not wanting to use my own time &amp; money to return or exchange their defective product..</li>
    <li> A thinner serum than I&#x27;m used to using but applies well.  Once again a little goes a long way.  Absorbs well.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> Product was not in it&#x27;s box which would indicate that it came from the manufacturer and there had been no tampering . The cap had been taped to the container and was very difficult to remove.  I&#x27;m left with an unremovable, sticky residue on the container.  In addition to a too-good-to-be-true price, the manner in which the product arrived doesn&#x27;t engender confidence that it isn&#x27;t somehow an inferior product.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great skincare product that contains the benefits of a vitamin c additive, this will do it.</li>
    <li> Jan Marini C Esta Serum is an excellent product and really smoothes the skin.  However, the new packaging is a disaster.   The dropper system used to work a treat.  You could draw it up into the syringe and place a few strategic drops on your face. Spread it on - job done.  Now, they&#x27;ve put it in a pump dispenser.  Big mistake - this is a liquid, not a cream, and, of course, when you press the pump it squirts and splats all over your hand - or, worse still, escapes between your fingers - or, as happened to me yesterday, it goes off at an angle and squirts all over the mirror!  If you press it again, you get too much - so, all in all, there&#x27;s a lot of wastage, which, at this price, doesn&#x27;t make me very happy. Bring back the dropper bottle - if it ain&#x27;t broke, why fix it??  I&#x27;m still trying to work out a way of dispensing it from the pump into my old dropper bottle.</li>
    <li> I use to be the distributor in a Middle Eastern Country. As far as I am concerned Jan Marini is one of the best products sold in America today.</li>
    <li> I got hooked on this fabulous product by my facialist.  I love it but it is very expensive-@ $100 retail.  I bought the same product online for much less.  I was not sure if it would be the exact product but so far it seems authentic.  Love it!  This was also my first Amazon purchase.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this item from my skin care doctor. I was surprised to find it available on Amazon at less than half the price that my doctor charges.  This product works well on older skin to give it a smooth appearance and it even makes my face feel softer.</li>
    <li> When I took the product out and tried to use it the pump did not work. The tube is not connected to the pump in order for it to work. I didn&#x27;t bother to return it because it seemed it would be a hassle. I wish it had been properly inspected before sending it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Elaine</li>
    <li> I am not happy!  This product is very expensive for 1 ounce no matter where you purchase it.  The item I purchased through Amazon is in a canister in which the pump is not working!  I have to unscrew the canister to use the product.  Perhaps this is why it is being sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It makes my skin feel and look great. It moisturizer perfectly and smells amazing. Although, this latest one I ordered is less orange than the one I had before but not sure if it matters. I love all Jan Marini products and am surprised not more people (even aestheticians) have not heard of her.</li>
    <li> C-esta or as I call it \\&quot;Liquid Gold\\&quot; is fabulous. I use it every morning and every night. It has improved my skin dramatically. It has even helped to diminish acne scarring. I did not give it 5 stars because I have an issue with the new packaging; the plastic is excessive and the pump mechanism is way too sensitive. If I am not careful when expressing it the product will splatter everywhere- it&#x27;s annoying! The original dropper style bottle was ideal. A larger size would be so nice, the 1 oz bottle only lasts 2 months or so. Although it is an expensive habit it is so worth it for any face regime. I am a huge Jan Marini fan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I just wanted to add an update and speak to the new packaging issues. I too hated the new pump version vs. the old dropper. However, Jan Marini got tons of complaints about the new pump and it squirting everywhere- wasting this expensive product on vanity mirrors! So they re-launched the new pump style (as of Dec. 2010) and it is so much better!! While I agree that the dropper is still the best, the newest version of pump style is a vast improvement. It isn&#x27;t as sensitive and I have had no problems with it squirting out too quickly or forcefully as I did with the first version. I do still feel that it dispenses too much of the product with each pump though. We can only hope they bring back the dropper, but until then this will do.***</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with the Jan Manni Face C-esta Serum. The product was priced much lower than I pay at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Amazing value!!  I was paying nearly twice as much elsewhere for Jan Marini C-Esta, which really worked to firm up my over 50-yr face.  I can put off plastic surgery for awhile.  Through Amazon, it was delivered in a flash.  I was very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Product is usually silky, applies beautifully and keeps the wrinkles away. This sellers product is grainy and this uncomfortable to apply. Get this stuff? Yes do it! But not from these folks.</li>
    <li> This one is definitely a perfect serum for my face. Absolutely love the effect on my face. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The product was as described and arrived quickly.  The product was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I love it!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. I have ordered this before and used it before and I really like the product.  This time it was watery and did not come out of the dispenser easily.  I am wondering if it was old since it&#x27;s not the consistency I am used to.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I think this product was old and grainy.  I love when i purchase at the dermatologists office but this had to have been old or very much a defect.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is very good.  It keeps my skin moist but never too oily.&lt;br /&gt;I think it helps prevent breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with c_serum or retinol during the day and with bio_clear at night&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer if it were a larger size or a bit more reasonable</li>
    <li> I have read that serums with vitamin c are an essential part of a skincare regimen. I love this product. It&#x27;s lightweight and absorbs readily. I use it on face and neck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 8 weeks I like it a lot makes my skin feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the C-esta Serum for a couple of years now.  It has completely changed by skin for the better.  Within weeks of first starting the serum I started receiving frequent complements on my skin,  I can&#x27;t imagine not using it every day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I always purchased it from my doctor, but recently realized that I can purchase it for less than half of what he charges through Amazon.  It is a lovely creamy liquid that tingles a slight bit when using.</li>
    <li> I am a 43yr old Medical Cosmetic Laser Esthetician, I have been using this product for years and would never go with out it. I have to have perfect skin in my business and I have to be wrinkle free. The Jan Marini products work really well. C-esta Serum along with a little laser and you can slow the appearance of aging to the skin, awesome product!</li>
    <li> pump never works right. Product is great, but expensive, so the fact that the pump doesn&#x27;t do its job is a problem.</li>
    <li> Not terribly sure what any of these products really do for you. I use it because it was recommended by someone who gave me a facial the one and only time I have ever had one. She had taught a class at my community center about skin care.Who knows what the back-up research really says? It feels a bit better when I use it, so I use it. Mostly in the hope that it is helping. Is my skin aging more slowly? There is no way to really tell.Even if I only used it on half my face it would be unscientific...more sun on the left when I drive and I drive alot! So who knows? Just using it out of wishful thinking! Trying to be as honest as I can here.Wish I could tell you more.</li>
    <li> I have used Jan Marini C-esta serum for years. It is a thick serum that pumps out into your hand&lt;br /&gt;This particular C-esta, from this store (Beauty It Is), was not sealed, was not in its box, had no ingredients specified and was definitely watered down. I have never had a Marini serum that squirts out watery into your hand. Product is not authentic and seems to have been watered down. It was a lot less costly than the C-esta serum that comes boxed and sealed. So, I guess you get what you pay for. But I will NEVER order anything that is sold through this store again. Store name is &amp;#34;Beauty It Is&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love Jan Marini C-esta Serum!!  I have been using her products for several years, and it has done wonders for my skin.  I get compliments all the time on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! Will order it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Jan Marini is the best</li>
    <li> I do not believe this product was new because it started pumping right away. And manufacturer did not authorized this product&#x27;s resale, if it is authentic. I cannot tell you more because Amazon won&#x27;t post it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product daily for many years. Although the vitamin c concentration is lower than many products available from dermatologists (13.5% I&#x27;ve been told), the combination of ingredients makes my skin feel silky, helps keep my skin tone uniform and basically feels better than any other high-end vitamin C product I&#x27;ve tried.  I only wish the cost were lower.  I&#x27;ve noticed significant price creep, and was informed this week that the price will go up again March 1, 2014.  I plan to stock-up before then.</li>
    <li> squirt bottle didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> When you get a new dispenser that is totally inadequate you begin to wonder about the product itself.  I would hang that packaging instantly!!!</li>
    <li> I like the feel &amp; the smell on my face!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and it is an awesome softening agent.  Makes your skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Love anything Jan Marini but especially this!</li>
    <li> I truly love this product and have used it for a few years. The only issue I have is the pump container it comes in. I have two full bottles and can hardly get the product out. It used to be packaged in a different container which seemed to work better. This has to be a known problem. I love the product but feel I&#x27;m wasting money if I can it out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel and it&#x27;s wonderful aroma.  My skin instantly feels softer and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is a great daytime serum with SPF. The scent is wonderful for the morning. I can tell it has made a difference for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and liked the results.  Generally, when I read reviews from other people complaining about the dispenser I figure they must be picky.  They were correct in this case.  The dispenser is HORRIBLE.  I like the product but won&#x27;t buy again until they change the bottle.</li>
    <li> Have used for years and love it.  Jan Marini is not inexpensive, but the quality is amazing.  If you have slightly moistened fingertips and a slightly moist face it only take one pump to cover your face and throat.  My facialist uses this and has seen great results on my skin and others.</li>
    <li> Nothing is perfect but I believe the serum has slowed down the aging process considerably.  I recommend using it along with other Jan Marini products.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and I really like it! All of Jan Marina&#x27;s products help me to look better and feel better! I think my skin looks good for my age! I have never had great skin, but these products have really helped  me!!</li>
    <li> I just love Jan Marini products!  This is another one of my favorites. My skin feels so great with the vitamin C in it.  Helps lighten &amp; tighten! Light weight, not heavy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!  And for sure the best price you can find!!  All these Jan Marini products are wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I like the way my face feels after I apply it. I will probably will be ordering some in the near future cause I&#x27;m out of it.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use mostly organic products but this is one of my exceptions! It is a great vitamin c serum that helps to fight free radicals which damage and age the skin. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> i love the product; just doesn&#x27;t seem like the bottle was full; didn&#x27;t think it was used.  will not purchase here again.</li>
    <li> This was my first time to try the C-esta serum. That said, unlike other reviewers, who really seemed to like it, I would have to say it is nothing to write home about. I wondered about the age of the other reviewers. It might seem fantastic to someone in their 20&#x27;s, but I am closer to 60. It is important to me to have a product that actually delivers the skincare it promises.  I have used C serums before.  They almost immediately provide a brightening effect, and over time can help with skin discoloration issues.  I gave this product two stars, which it earned for smelling nice, and for the easy pump bottle. As far as beauty benefits, it has none. You also must consider the color of the lotion. It is an ugly yellow orange, which affects makeup color, when applied over the serum, especially for porcelain skins, like mine.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, the pump for this bottle is horrible!!! I really like jan marini so wanted to give it a try. I was so frustrated with the bottle I was about to return it when I found the solution. You have to hold the bottle up side down and it seems to squirt better. Now that I know how to get it out I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> I have used many bottles of this stuff. When i received my item it was not boxed, has a very perfume smell and does not seem genuine. Will not order from this vender again!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used this for years - I am 56 years old and I do not have any wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Stinky product, but does give a certain oily glow to your face if you are wanting that.  I personally don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  I had paid $92 for the same thing somewhere else, was thrilled with the price.</li>
    <li> vitamin c is essential for healthy looking skin.  My plastic surgeon put me on to this product 10 years ago and I still am using it.  Leaves skin&lt;br /&gt;much clearer.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> This serum is a great product I have used it for years, however packaging is horrible. The serum does not dispense through the pump, it just expels air instead. The only way to access the serum is to take the top completely off and that exposes it to too much air after repeated use and loses it&#x27;s effectiveness. It also becomes discolored and dry.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, but the packaging has got to go. It comes in a pump that is good for a thick cream, but a disaster for a liquid, which is what this serum is. The pump has broken and failed to work on 2 separate bottles. I have to unscrew the top and basically pour a bit into my hand. This causes the remaining liquid to become unsterile. Also, the outside of the container gets all goopy and I have to wipe it down with a tissue. I am looking for another brand of serum because of this. It is a shame because the product is very good.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve tried several other expensive beauty lines and this works the best!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I would recommend this product to any one who would ask me.</li>
    <li> The plunger broke after 3 uses.</li>
    <li> I am surprised that why such a good product has a major mechanical issue with the pump that does not work.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but the liquid is difficult to apply, they should make it a cream base. I like Jan Marini products, and will most likely continue to use this product, just wish they would change the formulation for easier application.</li>
    <li> This batch seemed a little thinner than the first that I bought from the salon.  Hoping it is the same quality product.</li>
    <li> There was no tube on the inside to get the serum out.  I had to put it into another container.</li>
    <li> Love this product, however I&#x27;m half way through the bottle and the pump no longer works. I am very disappointed in the failure of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best moisturizer on the market. Your face will thank you for using it. I&#x27;ve bought Jan Marini products for years from my aesthetician who loves them and charges a lot more than Amazon does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why am I only giving it a 3? I&#x27;ve been sent two bottles, at two different times, both with broken pumps. That means I&#x27;ve had to unscrew the top and pour the liquid on my hands which makes this a very expensive moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product from my aesthetician until I found out I could buy it directly for a third of the expense. I always get compliments on my skin, and this is one of the reasons why.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this product, my already genetically-blessed skin looks even more gorgeous.  Great price!  Salons charge $90+ !</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  It has an incredible scent and leaves your face nourished as though you just had a facial.</li>
    <li> Really diminishes the look of fines lines, especially around the eyes.  My skin just drinks it up.  No break outs either and I have really sensitive skin.  ( I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s)</li>
    <li> i have to unscrew cap</li>
    <li> very expensive.  smells nice.  feels good going on my face and i think it is helping my tone. not sure it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected for a Jan Marini product. Will not buy again other than from a reputable Marini retailer. This product must&#x27;ve been expired.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for your moisturizer. The serum is light and I use it in the winter. I use the cream for the summer. The pump fails sometimes but overall it is just fine.</li>
    <li> Not convinced it is real or maybe old.</li>
    <li> Rec. by my dermatologist. Meeting my needs. Love to fragrance &amp; was @ a better price than I could find locally here in Tucson.</li>
    <li> I love the serum if I could get it out. After two weeks the part that you push down to get the serum out doesn&#x27;t work so each time I want to use it I have to unscrew the top and try to shake it out of container.</li>
