      <li>yes, let me mention Amazon has the best prices by far!!!!</li>
      <li>I started out just using the Miracle Leave-In Treatment (also amazing)</li>
      <li>My mom suggested I try this product because she liked the results she had with it.  </li>
      <li>- I can use that all on its own and it gives a really nice finish, and even my second-day hair is well-behaved.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly, colored, and highlighted hair, and it works flawless with my texture and curls.</li>
      <li>but I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this new</li>
      <li>The shampoo, conditioner and smoothing balm have a very strong smell that gives me a headache.</li>
      <li>This line is by far the best of them all.</li>
      <li>MY HAIR IS VERY FINE AND DAMAGED IT WORKS</li>
      <li>I love, love, love these products!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the</li>
      <li>I WOULD PURCHASE IT AGAIN FOR SURE ..</li>
      <li>Love</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
      <li>, nothing works any better than these products</li>
      <li>and my hair really looks good when I use the product.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST shampoo and conditioner set by far my daughter had really course hair abd every time I was her hair</li>
      <li>It is easy to use  </li>
      <li>Honestly, can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
      <li>Finally, tip it off with the smoothing balm, my hair has never felt so great.</li>
      <li>think the issue may be that this isn&#x27;t a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have used &amp;#34;IT&#x27;S a 10&amp;#34; products for a few years and they&#x27;re great!  </li>
      <li>detangles like no other adds shine and it smells so good after a week</li>
      <li>The first day was great, hair looks good, smells good, but no different really than my favorites that I use:  Frederic Fakkai or Bed Head Urban Antidotes.  </li>
      <li>The smell is amazing, and my hair felt so soft after.</li>
      <li>and they have enjoyed the product as much as I have.</li>
      <li>I have tried SO many hair products over the years and this line has absolutely blown me away.  </li>
      <li>Quick shipment.</li>
      <li>However, it is well worth it if you have frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it...</li>
      <li>It was shiny and healthy looking and is oh so soft.  </li>
      <li>This product has met my approval for silky and fresh smelling hair.</li>
      <li>Loved all the other</li>
      <li>I noticed the difference right away with the shampoo.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are suitable for my hair texture and leaves my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the sulfate free</li>
      <li>However when my hair is dry my curls are nice and uniform and my hair is very shiny.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair super soft.  </li>
      <li>Even when I only use the shampoo and conditioner and use my other styling products, I notice a huge difference - my hair is smooth and shiny and it STAYS smooth despite any &amp;#34;climatological unfriendliness&amp;#34; and living in South Texas</li>
      <li>Wife really enjoys this product</li>
      <li>I also really like the balm that comes in this set</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s A 10 over WEN not only because of the results I get with it, but because the length of time it takes to use a full bottle and the price is much easier to handle these days!</li>
      <li>I have long hair and use more Conditioner than shampoo, so I ran out of conditioner first and still have shampoo left and just using that alone</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products from the grocery store shelf to high end salon purchases.  </li>
      <li>but i just guess i had high expectations.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I wish the smoothing balm gave my hair a little more texture/weight</li>
      <li>Normally I can leave my hair as is for another day or two, as I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day.  </li>
      <li>My hair was very soft and silky without the need for conditioner..</li>
      <li>I love their other products like the keratin deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>and my hair is still so soft and dries faster than normal.</li>
      <li>I love it, I have always been a fan of its a ten, my complain is unlike other conditioners</li>
      <li>I have very curly (kinky) hair for a white female, plus I live in a high humidity region of the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All the products smell lovely, it&#x27;s a subtle scent.</li>
      <li>He said this his wife uses it and loves it, but for me, since it adds a lot more moisture to my hair, with Texas now heating up and the sweat from my neck, it is probably causing my hair in the back to curl and wave in an odd way and look unruly the next morning.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft or silky as other products.</li>
<li> /&gt;  Improve elasticity and strengthen hair (didn&#x27;t use it long enough to comment on this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> she cry when it&#x27;s time to comb it out and blow dry it....</li>
<li> Deep Conditioner cuts down drying time strengthens hair and adds vibrancy (I didn&#x27;t notice faster</li>
<li> My hair is very dry after using these.  </li>
<li> I have used it on my hair, my sisters and other family members hair</li>
<li> 5 ounce Smoothing Balm cuts down drying time assists in style hold</li>
<li> I used Pantene for a long time and my hair was dull.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive in the store and Amazon offers package deals.</li>
<li> It looked shapeless, dull, wavy and frizzy and even a bit oily in some spots.  </li>
<li> (my hair was dull, tangly, and frizzy after using it)&lt;br /</li>
<li> This was an expensive experiment, and what I learned is, I won&#x27;t try any more shampoos, especially expensive ones like this, until I try a sample.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I saw my hair stylist on 4.26.14 and asked why my hair did not seem to like this product.  </li>
<li> &gt;  Protect your hair from the environment while adding shine and cutting down on Frizz (I had serious frizz with this)&lt;br</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair, but at least for me, it delivers!</li>
<li> A little disappointing.</li>
<li> I have thin, wavy/curly hair.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t want to talk bad about WEN at all, but I choose to stick with</li>
<li> well, bad.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed I am.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As always, the Its a 10 line is a big fat 10!  I hightly recommend this product to anyone looking to add a boost to their homecare hair care routine.</li>
    <li> I use this sparingly, because it is pricey. However, it is well worth it if you have frizzy hair. It makes my hair look and feel like silk, and I&#x27;m someone who dyes her hair constantly. All the products smell lovely, it&#x27;s a subtle scent. All in all, it feels like I&#x27;ve left the salon every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I have color-treated wavy-ish hair that responds to any degree of humidity by turning into a football helmet.  I have tried SO many hair products over the years and this line has absolutely blown me away.  I started out just using the Miracle Leave-In Treatment (also amazing) and so took the plunge and tried this line as well.  Even when I only use the shampoo and conditioner and use my other styling products, I notice a huge difference - my hair is smooth and shiny and it STAYS smooth despite any &amp;#34;climatological unfriendliness&amp;#34; and living in South Texas you know there&#x27;s a lot of that.  I also really like the balm that comes in this set - I can use that all on its own and it gives a really nice finish, and even my second-day hair is well-behaved.  Honestly, can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  It&#x27;s pricy so I don&#x27;t use it every time I wash my hair, but at least for me, it delivers!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product!  The ingredients are suitable for my hair texture and leaves my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
    <li> I used Pantene for a long time and my hair was dull.  My mom suggested I try this product because she liked the results she had with it.  After a week of using It&#x27;s a 10, I started receiving compliments on my hair.  It was shiny and healthy looking and is oh so soft.  Silk Express has a pleasant smell and the smoothing balm controls my frizz after blow drying.</li>
    <li> Great seller! Quick shipment. Love It&#x27;s a 10 products! I have tried all their lines. This line is by far the best of them all.</li>
    <li> The following is what the seller claims and my notes are in parentheses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  10 ounce Shampoo enhances silkiness and shine. (my hair was dull, tangly, and frizzy after using it)&lt;br /&gt;  Protects color and restores vibrancy (I only used this 3 times and it seemed to strip color)&lt;br /&gt;  5 ounce Deep Conditioner cuts down drying time strengthens hair and adds vibrancy (I didn&#x27;t notice faster drying)&lt;br /&gt;  5 ounce Smoothing Balm cuts down drying time assists in style hold (the \\&quot;smoothing balm\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t smooth)&lt;br /&gt;  Protect your hair from the environment while adding shine and cutting down on Frizz (I had serious frizz with this)&lt;br /&gt;  Improve elasticity and strengthen hair (didn&#x27;t use it long enough to comment on this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the issue may be that this isn&#x27;t a sulfate free shampoo. One seller claimed it was and I purchased this trio based on that information. I highly recommend the sulfate free it&#x27;s a 10 shampoos, and the leave in spray conditioner with keratin.</li>
    <li> I ended up sending it to my foster daughter, for her to use. She hasn&#x27;t reported any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I loooove this product. It makes my hair feel wonderful and the smoothing balm helps hold my hairstyle, give my hair a beautiful shine, and makes my hair smell wonderful! I WILL buy this product again!</li>
    <li> MY HAIR IS VERY FINE AND DAMAGED IT WORKS JUST AS DESCRIBED I WOULD PURCHASE IT AGAIN FOR SURE ..</li>
    <li> I just ordered it and soon as this set came I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I noticed the difference right away with the shampoo. The smell is amazing, and my hair felt so soft after. Then, the conditioner is like heaven. My hair felt like silk in my hands. Finally, tip it off with the smoothing balm, my hair has never felt so great. It does everything it said it would on the back, and I would recommend it for all hair types.</li>
    <li> as described but all items had tape wrapped around to keep them sealed and when removed the sticky stuff stayed on the bottles making them all sticky</li>
    <li> Wife really enjoys this product</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these products!</li>
    <li> I have thin, wavy/curly hair.  My stylist recommended this brand so I gave it a try.  Very happy with it.  Makes my hair super soft.  I wish the smoothing balm gave my hair a little more texture/weight but otherwise I do like the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product has met my approval for silky and fresh smelling hair. I have used it on my hair, my sisters and other family members hair and they have enjoyed the product as much as I have. Keep up the good work. I don&#x27;t like the price, its can be a lil cheaper, until I find something else cheaper that work as good for my hair I  will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The name says it all... The lady who does my hair used the smoothing balm only and the smell alone it awesome... It&#x27;s a bit expensive in the store and Amazon offers package deals. It&#x27;s worth it... I love the shampoo and Conditioner. I have long hair and use more Conditioner than shampoo, so I ran out of conditioner first and still have shampoo left and just using that alone and my hair is still so soft and dries faster than normal.</li>
    <li> The shampoo, conditioner and smoothing balm have a very strong smell that gives me a headache. I bought online so I didn&#x27;t know this. My hair is very dry after using these.  I love their other products like the keratin deep conditioner.  A little disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love the It&#x27;s a 10 line but I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this new product.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft or silky as other products.</li>
    <li> I have used &amp;#34;IT&#x27;S a 10&amp;#34; products for a few years and they&#x27;re great!  I have very curly (kinky) hair for a white female, plus I live in a high humidity region of the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used all kinds of products from the grocery store shelf to high end salon purchases.  I&#x27;ve even forwarded my picture to a salon in Arizona to try to get some help with the curl, nothing works any better than these products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, let me mention Amazon has the best prices by far!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so ecstatic to finally try out this line it works good and all but i personally didnt feel a difference in softness, or silkyness they you all good products but i just guess i had high expectations.</li>
    <li> Loved all the other It&#x27;s A 10 products but this &amp;#34;Express&amp;#34; line must be for oily hair---not as soothing as the others.</li>
    <li> I read all of the rave reviews and thought I should immediately try the shampoo, conditioner and smoothing balm..  The first day was great, hair looks good, smells good, but no different really than my favorites that I use:  Frederic Fakkai or Bed Head Urban Antidotes.  Normally I can leave my hair as is for another day or two, as I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day.  But the next day after using these products my hair looked, well, bad.  It looked like I needed to wash my hair, actually.  It looked shapeless, dull, wavy and frizzy and even a bit oily in some spots.  I can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed I am.  This was an expensive experiment, and what I learned is, I won&#x27;t try any more shampoos, especially expensive ones like this, until I try a sample.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I saw my hair stylist on 4.26.14 and asked why my hair did not seem to like this product.  He said this his wife uses it and loves it, but for me, since it adds a lot more moisture to my hair, with Texas now heating up and the sweat from my neck, it is probably causing my hair in the back to curl and wave in an odd way and look unruly the next morning.  So for now, I will go back to the products that work for me.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5.21.14 Although the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t work for me, the smoothing balm is really great.  My hair looks sleek and shiny when I use it.  So this was not a total loss.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s name!  My hair was very soft and silky without the need for conditioner.. I have very curly, colored, and highlighted hair, and it works flawless with my texture and curls. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Does not work on my hair the way I thought it would.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST shampoo and conditioner set by far my daughter had really course hair abd every time I was her hair she cry when it&#x27;s time to comb it out and blow dry it....we had no tears with this set it detangles like no other adds shine and it smells so good after a week my hair still smells great I would definitely and I will definitely keep purchasing this product I do wish this brand came in bigger sizes though</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is easy to use  and my hair really looks good when I use the product.</li>
    <li> I love it, I have always been a fan of its a ten, my complain is unlike other conditioners were you feel the softness when you rinse it away with this one you can&#x27;t. However when my hair is dry my curls are nice and uniform and my hair is very shiny.</li>
    <li> I am a BIG fan of It&#x27;s A 10 products. I don&#x27;t want to talk bad about WEN at all, but I choose to stick with It&#x27;s A 10 over WEN not only because of the results I get with it, but because the length of time it takes to use a full bottle and the price is much easier to handle these days!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have used.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
