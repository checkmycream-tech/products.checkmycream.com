      <li>Washes out easily and, most importantly, boasts an amazing ingredient list!</li>
      <li>Love this gel works great and it all natural !!!!</li>
      <li>:) I love the scent and I also like that I don&#x27;t have to wash it off every day.</li>
      <li>Prefer something more like a pomade or wax.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even get better as the day went on.  </li>
      <li>Smells ok.</li>
      <li>Love this product and the fact that it&#x27;s made specifically for babies and children.</li>
      <li>and I love there products and smell</li>
      <li>He was born with a lot of hair most of which is curly.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it is not harmful to children.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It smells like baby powder, which is ok, I guess, except in the summer when you&#x27;re going outdoors -</li>
      <li>Love the smell and it works well.  </li>
      <li>It has a great, natural hold.</li>
      <li>At first, I was hesitant about putting gel on my 13 month old baby&#x27;s hair but after contacting the company with some questions (excellent customer service and prompt responses!!)</li>
      <li>Easy to wash out.  </li>
      <li>It easily brushes out and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
      <li>I want to give this 5 stars but the scent is so strong that after just one use I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use the product again.</li>
      <li>This is better, it stays in my son&#x27;s hair most of the day, but when you go to get the gel out of the tube, you don&#x27;t need to squeeze it, it automatically comes out at an alarming rate, so they need to figure out a better way to package the gel where i am not wasting most of it washing my hands because the gel just pours out of the tube, otherwise product is good.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
      <li>The smell was so strong I had to return it.</li>
      <li>Strong smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is too strong for us.</li>
      <li>the tape they used was so strong that when I went to pull it off it broke the lid to the cap</li>
      <li>And the BEST part is, I know it&#x27;s safe for my little man!</li>
      <li>, so make sure you&#x27;re holding the hole end UP and squeeze VERY GENTLY to make sure you don&#x27;t end up with a handful of hair goo.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine like that too.  </li>
      <li>So being that it works well plus is made safe for the kid, I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>, I was comfortable trying it on my baby.</li>
      <li>There just isn&#x27;t anything else like this available for kids.</li>
      <li>all natural + good smelling + quality product //</li>
      <li>And as a bonus it smells amazing and is great for kids that are sensitive to chemicals due to its amazing ingredients.</li>
      <li>This gel smells great and provides a moderate hold without looking or feeling like hair is full of product.  </li>
      <li>This gel is perfect for my little ones curly hair!</li>
      <li>so I feel it is worth the price!</li>
      <li>Just on special occasions.  </li>
      <li>FAST delivery :)</li>
      <li>Until I tried Hot Tot, I now know what its like to have his hair manageable, soft, smells good, and keeps the style for hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad... helps in some styling.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend Hot Tot Styling Gel for stylish hair styles for littles!</li>
      <li>I am soooo lucky that I found these products.</li>
      <li>My one year old has a good set of hair (not too much), but this gel wouldn&#x27;t hold his Mohawk...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to accidentally put on too much and end up with crunchy hair - but when that happens I just comb through it to loosen up the crunch</li>
      <li>tot&#x27;s &amp; super easy to clean up -- NOT MESSY!</li>
      <li>Hot Tot Styling Gel is not greasy/grimey!</li>
      <li>I love that these products are natural!</li>
      <li>Always a fan of Hot Tots products!</li>
      <li>This is a little strong for my daughter&#x27;s fine wavy hair and more fragrant than I expected, but it works great for pulling her hair up in a bun for ballet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I found a product that is not only safe for my baby, it actually works very well!</li>
      <li>Anyone who is into naturally products doesn&#x27;t want a perfume in their products!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong. Baby has crazy, poofy hair, so this gel tames it quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I love how its smells and how it doesn&#x27;t leave my daughters hair all flaky and stiff either.</li>
    <li> I like it for my almost 2 year old, but there is a slight smell (not a bad one, but a strong one), and it doesn&#x27;t hold his spikes up much.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and holds great. Love it</li>
    <li> Holds all day.  Smells great. I definitely  would recommend it to any parent with an infant with crazy hair !</li>
    <li> I bought this product I think it&#x27;s great! I enjoy using the product and it really helps when I style my hair.</li>
    <li> Works great on my sons curly hair</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it works well.  Have 3 year old and 2 year old grandsons.  My daughter does such a cute job of styling their hair with this gel.  It last long but with winter hats, it is hard to keep the style.  After taking off those knit hats or hoods  just wet your fingers with water a very little and restyle.  Back to a cute look again.  I like the idea that the products used to make this gel is made for little tots. That is what sold me. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This gel smells great and provides a moderate hold without looking or feeling like hair is full of product.  The price seemed a bit high at time of purchase but the product lasts a really long time.  For me it was a good value</li>
    <li> This is a little strong for my daughter&#x27;s fine wavy hair and more fragrant than I expected, but it works great for pulling her hair up in a bun for ballet.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this gel! I like to keep my 2 year old&#x27;s hair a little longer (think \\&quot;surfer shag\\&quot;) and love that this gel is enough to be able to style it on days where I just want it out of his face. It tames his flyaways beautifully and smooths his hair without being crunchy and sticky. He is thick hair and it does wonders at keeping it styled and yet still soft all day long! Washes out easily and, most importantly, boasts an amazing ingredient list! We LOVE this gel!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really easy to accidentally put on too much and end up with crunchy hair - but when that happens I just comb through it to loosen up the crunch and it still holds its shape.  It does come out REALLY fast if you squeeze and you&#x27;re holding it with the hole end down, so make sure you&#x27;re holding the hole end UP and squeeze VERY GENTLY to make sure you don&#x27;t end up with a handful of hair goo.  It smells like baby powder, which is ok, I guess, except in the summer when you&#x27;re going outdoors - it seems to attract bees.  But I guess there are worse things it could smell like.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and it&#x27;s not strong at all...it does its job. Holds all day. Took of one star coz I had a hard time removing in fact. I had to wash my sons hair a couple of times but still didn&#x27;t come off all the way.</li>
    <li> It holds really well. not a big fans of the strong smell.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a stiff hair product.  My son has stick straight hair and it does help it to stay in a &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; just brushed to the side when it&#x27;s in his hair.  It easily brushes out and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  I&#x27;ve reapplied it after a nap and it&#x27;s fine like that too.  If you want it to spike your child&#x27;s hair you might want to use their other products.  Great product line.</li>
    <li> Like all the other products this is a must have. There just isn&#x27;t anything else like this available for kids.</li>
    <li> The scent is rather strong when you first apply it, but I don&#x27;t seem to notice it as much as the day passes.  Overall, the product works well on both my girls, so it is worth it to me to even if the smell bothered me.</li>
    <li> I loved the way it worked, and how it felt in my little ones hair, but I personally could not stand the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is not harmful to children. It doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals. It also smells great and works great.</li>
    <li> The gel was really sticky and did not take my babies crazy hair very well.  It also did not stay soft like some of the reviews said.</li>
    <li> This gel is perfect for my little ones curly hair! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Nice gel without being too gooey.</li>
    <li> We have been using this for several months to help tame my toddlers hair.  She doesn&#x27;t keep clips, bows, or pony tails in but she lets me use a little bit of this gel to fix her hair.  The fragrance is pleasant without being overpowering.  The gel lasts for most of the day but usually after a nap or a lot of rough play it needs to be reapplied.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This styling gel is working great for my son.  Keeps his crazy hair in place without making it overly stiff or gummy.  Just right.  Easy to wash out.  The price was a bit higher than what I was expecting to pay, but apparently kid products are harder to come by than their adult counterparts.  And I understand that it has to be safer and all that.  So being that it works well plus is made safe for the kid, I&#x27;m happy to pay a little more.  Plus it doesn&#x27;t get used every single day.  Just on special occasions.  So it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and safe for toddlers hair.very flexible. Love to support by is company after seeing it on shark tank!</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second bottle of the styling gel.  My son loves to get his hair done and he looks super cute with a little spike!  The best aspect of the product is its scent.  I had a little issue ordering the product from their website, but contacted the owner who was fabulous and helped me get it all straightened out.  Great product, great customer service, and overall great company!</li>
    <li> Worked well for my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Very sticky, terrible hold, overwhelming smell. Threw it away. Couldn&#x27;t believe I spent $18 on this product. Yuck!</li>
    <li> This is great for my tots. I use it on both my daughter (2.5 years old) and son (8 months old). It has a great, natural hold. It doesn&#x27;t flake or feel gunky or heavy.</li>
    <li> Very good gel. Works as promised. Its seems to be gentle and does not have any real odor. The hold itself is not as strong as the traditional gels, (we get about 3 or 4 hrs out of this one), but I like that it is less chemical-ly than the traditional drug store gels to keep my toddler&#x27;s hair unaltered.</li>
    <li> Love this gel works great and it all natural !!!! Was having a hard time on using hair salon products on my infant hair , did not want to put harsh chemicals on my son hair and was googling natural products for baby and found hot tots and I love there products and smell</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this for my son. Didn&#x27;t do anything to keep his hair in place.  It has a heavy and not-so-pleasant scent. Can&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only hair gel that my son will let me use in his hair! He likes that it&#x27;s not sticky, so it doesn&#x27;t pull his hair, and I like that it&#x27;s safer than most other gels you can find at the store, and it holds his hair in place long enough for photos, or preschool. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t get white and flakey either. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> all natural + good smelling + quality product // Hot Tot Styling Gel is not greasy/grimey! This styling product is gentle for babies + tot&#x27;s &amp; super easy to clean up -- NOT MESSY! Highly recommend Hot Tot Styling Gel for stylish hair styles for littles!</li>
    <li> Sent it back.  I could not get past the REALLY REALLY REALLY strong smell.  It was horrible. It didn&#x27;t even get better as the day went on.  I actually felt guilty for subjecting my son to this in his hair.  I really wanted to love this product, but ultimately ended up using my husbands gel for my sons hair.  It worked fairly well for gel, but like I said- the smell was so bad that it could have been the best gel ever (which it wasn&#x27;t), and I still would have sent it back.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold and has a very strong smell! Never using again. The smell gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a product line that my two boys will be using! My boys are both into modeling and need to always look their best whether it is for a photo shoot or an audition. These product ensure that it happens and they do look their best with these wonderful products in their hair! i am in love with the great customer service and the adorable packaging for the product!</li>
    <li> I want to give this 5 stars but the scent is so strong that after just one use I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use the product again. This is disappointing because it was not a cheap product and it works very well.</li>
    <li> Strong smell. Left toddlers scalp very dry and didn&#x27;t really have much hold at all. Disappointed</li>
    <li> The gel works well and I really like the smell of it in my son&#x27;s wavy hair. I love that these products are natural!</li>
    <li> Stinks and doesn&#x27;t work too well. I have a 1 year old with a lot of hair. I had to use way too much of this to keep it in place. Used so much it weighed his hair down flat. And this stuff stinks and takes too long to dry. He reaches up to see what I&#x27;m doing when I do his hair and so he kept getting this junk on his hands, which is hard to wash off. Has a weird residue to it when it&#x27;s on your skin and you wet it. I just use Magic Move the one in the red jar on his hair now. Works much better for a kid with a lot of hair and a cool hairstyle that does not include matting his hair flat to his head.</li>
    <li> Because of my stubborn insistence on letting my 2 year old&#x27;s hair grow long (my hair is falling out, so I&#x27;m living vicariously), it was always in his eyes.  As a last ditch effort, I bought this gel.  It worked fine, was not greasy, didn&#x27;t bother him, but it didn&#x27;t hold for too long.  Needed to reapply it regularly.  After two weeks of using this, I conceded my stupidity and just cut his hair.  We have plenty left, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it again if we need to.</li>
    <li> The smell was so strong I had to return it. Gave me a headache within 5 minutes and I am not usually so sensitive to products. For them to advertise as natural and safe for kids they need to ditch the fragrance. Anyone who is into naturally products doesn&#x27;t want a perfume in their products!!!!!</li>
    <li> Holds my baby&#x27;s hair do all day.  He gets compliments all the time and everyone always asks what I use in his hair.  Especially when I have his hair in a faux hawk.  Love this product and the fact that it&#x27;s made specifically for babies and children.</li>
    <li> Always a fan of Hot Tots products! Smells so good! FAST delivery :)</li>
    <li> I bought this gel for my kids after seeing it on Shark Tank and I love it!  I use it on my kids everyday but now I use it for myself as well.  It works awesome and smells so good!!!!</li>
    <li> Hair had a little static when using this product. However, the curl serum worked miracles.</li>
    <li> This is better, it stays in my son&#x27;s hair most of the day, but when you go to get the gel out of the tube, you don&#x27;t need to squeeze it, it automatically comes out at an alarming rate, so they need to figure out a better way to package the gel where i am not wasting most of it washing my hands because the gel just pours out of the tube, otherwise product is good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad... helps in some styling. My one year old has a good set of hair (not too much), but this gel wouldn&#x27;t hold his Mohawk... I just wanted something without the harmful chemicals, so this isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> This gel doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my sons hair.  He has very coarse/hard-to-manage hair.  This product was probably designed for very fine baby hair.  The gel is also a little watery for my preference.  Prefer something more like a pomade or wax. Smells ok. Disappointed overall.</li>
    <li> Gel is very easy to use and smells amazing! The hold is good but not crunchy which I like. Also very easy to wash out. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for my daughter for about a year now.  She is 2 years old with naturally curly hair as she is mixed with Black and Puerto Rican.  I wanted a product that will help hold her curls without being stiff.  I use a little bit of this gel on her hair everyday along with a leave in conditioner.  I also use the curl serum also by Hot Tot.  The gel helps hold the curls so they don&#x27;t get frizzy.  It also doesn&#x27;t flake or turn white on her hair.  She gets so many compliments on her hair and this product works great for her hair type.  The products in this line are on the pricey side, but 1 bottle of this gel lasts for 3-4 months so I feel it is worth the price!</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s hair hasn&#x27;t been this manageable EVER. He was born with a lot of hair most of which is curly. I am soooo lucky that I found these products. Its kinda like having an adult hair care line from the quality standpoint... for kids. I used to use HIPPEAS and didn&#x27;t really have a problem - or so I thought. Until I tried Hot Tot, I now know what its like to have his hair manageable, soft, smells good, and keeps the style for hours. This is a MUST BUY! Hashtag Gentry Hudson on Instagram to see all of his fantastic hair do&#x27;s thanks to Hot Tot!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this styling gel, I use it daily on my two yr olds hair. It gives the prefect hold but doesn&#x27;t leave it hard and crunchy like most gels do not does it flake. And as a bonus it smells amazing and is great for kids that are sensitive to chemicals due to its amazing ingredients. I also use the styling  structure cream along with the gel which is also a great product.</li>
    <li> The hair gel great for kids!! Doesn&#x27;t leave hair crunchy and smells good!! Holds curls in place and stays all day!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! At first, I was hesitant about putting gel on my 13 month old baby&#x27;s hair but after contacting the company with some questions (excellent customer service and prompt responses!!), I was comfortable trying it on my baby. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I cannot express how much I love it! It holds so well! It is not messy or sticky and whatever is left on my hands, I actually use it on my own hair! :) I love the scent and I also like that I don&#x27;t have to wash it off every day. The next day, I just add water and style it again and it will stay put the whole day. I&#x27;m so happy that I found a product that is not only safe for my baby, it actually works very well! I am having so much fun styling my baby&#x27;s hair every day- it&#x27;s awesome! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Smells kind of funky but does the job 🌟</li>
    <li> This styling gel is great we really like it for our 15 month old.  She has curly hair and it tames it down.  It also smells nice is not sticky or stiff and overall it a really nice product.&lt;br /&gt;My only trouble was the company that sent it to us taped the cap shut I assume to ensure that it did not come uncapped during shipping and leak out however the tape they used was so strong that when I went to pull it off it broke the lid to the cap and now we have to deal with it every time we use it.  The product itself it wonderful.  I would ask the seller to not use packing tape on the lid next time it is sent out but rather something to hold it in place such as bubble wrap.</li>
    <li> it holds my 10 months old son&#x27;s hair very well. Only complaint is the strong smell.</li>
    <li> This is our FAVORITE go-to product for my son&#x27;s hair!! We love trendy styles with his hair and this product gets his hair just where we want it! Whether it be pompadour, Mohawk or slicked back...this does it! Doesn&#x27;t make his hair sticky or stiff and washes out easily! Everyone comments how good his hair smells (the scent is AMAZING). And the BEST part is, I know it&#x27;s safe for my little man! ❤️</li>
    <li> The smell is too strong for us. It isn&#x27;t terrible if you don&#x27;t mind perfumes, but I don&#x27;t like them, and I don&#x27;t want my 1 year old daughter to breathe that all day. I was also unsatisfied with the hold. Her soft hair needs something stronger.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great.</li>
    <li> I found this product to leave my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair very stiff and dry. I ordered Hot Tot Styling Gel after reading all the positive reviews...however, it was not quite the type of product we were looking for.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is somewhat fine with a mixture of loose curls and waves. We needed something that would tame fly-aways but still leave her hair soft and bouncy. This, unfortunately, even only using a small pea-sized amount did not do the trick. Each time we tried it, after it dried, her hair would be stiff and hard to comb later. I gave it 3 stars though, since some buyers may actually be looking for a &amp;#34;strong-holding gel&amp;#34;</li>
