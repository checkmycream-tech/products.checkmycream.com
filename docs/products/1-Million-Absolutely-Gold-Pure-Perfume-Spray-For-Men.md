<li> Looks like the seller is selling fake, refilled bottles.</li>
<li> Fake: After a couple of uses, it is appearing that its just a water spray.</li>

<li> I am shocked the container is all gold</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exquisite cologne.  Genuine male fragrance which lasts from shower to shower</li>
    <li> the best costumer service ever&lt;br /&gt;love this 1 million Parfum</li>
    <li> I bought this parfume at Macys in 2012 i loved it. I decided to buy it through Amazon I am shocked the container is all gold I still have the parfume i bought to macys the scent compared to what was delivered to me is different i must i rated this product less than one star but there is no option for it. I dont know how to make my voice heard</li>
    <li> Its ok but not as great as some make it out to be. Above average</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure to buy this after reading some reviews that said that it wasn&#x27;t original, or that they had received the regular EDT presentation, so this was the very first thing I checked. All good, the bottle says parfum.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance but doesn&#x27;t last all day long</li>
    <li> I love it and it met my expectations. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Gooooood stuff ! Last a long time. Price good.</li>
    <li> Smells like million $</li>
    <li> Perfect eau de parfum. It&#x27;s stronger scent than the eau de toilette. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Before One million I used Paco &amp;#34;Pour Home.&amp;#34;  I liked it.  This one, for me, was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> good fragrance, but the packaging too big</li>
    <li> only one star for this product , it is not Pure Parfum.</li>
    <li> The comment by Ryan Alexander saying this fragrance in alcohol-free......  Uh, what??  No, ya goof, it most certainly is not alcohol-free.</li>
    <li> excellent. I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> Dont Missed perfect more than 24 hours smelling great</li>
    <li> excellent and fast and affordable</li>
    <li> I am very picky about the smell of men&#x27;s cologne...but I definitely like wearing this one.</li>
    <li> This parfum made 10 women melt! They loved the scent and complimented that it wasnt too strong but just right. It has a very pleasant spice to it and I would compare it to CK euphoria. I feel it&#x27;s in a league of its own and so far hasn&#x27;t made anyone sneeze! Just sayin...</li>
    <li> i use it since two days and i think i did a good choice it&#x27;s really pure</li>
    <li> Ordered this online since I don&#x27;t live near a store that carries it.  The only thing I had to go on smell wise was a little insert in a magazine.  This is soooooo potent, but smells really good... in an hour or two</li>
    <li> I usually had to spray twice with other parfumes. With Paco Rabanne one time spay is enough. Long lasting parfum. It is a great scent.</li>
    <li> This Parfum smells great! Got it for my husband and he loves it, the packaging and the bottle is very attractive.  It is Parfume and not eau do toilette so a little bit goes a long way. The smell is a little strong at first and smells almost like mosquito spray but after about half an hour it develops very pleasant vanilla and leather notes that definitely turn heads of both sexes.  It&#x27;s definitely a scent that I will be purchasing for my husband on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I was sent a product changed, I pay for a one million parfum absollutely Pure gold and I get eau the toilette</li>
    <li> Very potent and last long.</li>
    <li> My hubby &amp; Son love this, I need more.</li>
    <li> lovely, great product, and it&#x27;s alcohol free the scent remains on your clothes long even after it&#x27;s washed I love it</li>
    <li> I get regular compliments when wearing this fragrance and it smells different than its brother the intense and the original 1 million so id do think its not as popular and that&#x27;s what I like.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is much better than the eau de toilette version of it. I have both and the parfum lasts longer and smells better. I;m not good at describing scents so you&#x27;ll have to take my word for it. If you&#x27;re looking for that perfect manly scent, look no further.</li>
    <li> Unique scent ..... I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Always a head turner.</li>
    <li> The girls love it.&lt;br /&gt;Big Dog</li>
    <li> Grown man.  Love this smell.  Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> If you like long lasting scents this is it. If you like a scent that you put on and people can smell your trail this is it. I love it amazing.</li>
    <li> One Million is my favorite fragrance since 2010 and I am very satisfied and I strongly recommend it. For the guys they never use it before you will get regular compliments when you wearing this fragrance :)</li>
    <li> ........Very nice fragrance that has drawn lots of attention from both sexes (Guys &amp; girls). I also love the commanding feel it gives as u watch people turn their heads around in approval as u pass by. Good Value for money and its long-lasting as well.</li>
    <li> Excelent, long lasting, projects very well, and always gets complimemts!! Overall happy with this perfume and will definitely buy frim this seller.</li>
    <li> The most wonderful  Parfums I ever had. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> A beguiling scent by Paco Rabanne who has outdone himself once again. Bought as a gift, this wonderful parfum received many compliments both by the wearer and others.</li>
    <li> I got the big bottle because of some of the positive reviews here. It&#x27;s smells ok, nothing great or different. It actually reminds me of another cologne thats lost and forgotten in my medicine cabinet. I have it in my glove box, put it on during the ride to work. 1 SQUIRT CAN MAKE 10 PEOPLE SNEEZE.... It&#x27;s not the type of colongne to make anyone ask about it. People take a step back actually when wearing it. The packaging is really nice though. This one might actually get lost too...</li>
    <li> Awesome,thank you Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I just got this cologne today an I love it, this has a nice cent to it, I can&#x27;t wait to put this on!  Try it.</li>

    <li> Got this in a blind buy and at first thought it smelled like one million the original, but it&#x27;s not. Little bit more citrus, florals, &amp; leather at its base.  Very nice and last very long. beast mode longevity and sillage is like 10 feet for within 4-6 sprays.</li>
    <li> Very potent. Only use one spray.</li>
