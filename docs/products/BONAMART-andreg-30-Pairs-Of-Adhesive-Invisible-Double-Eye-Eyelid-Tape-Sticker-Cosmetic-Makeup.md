      <li>It does it&#x27;s job and works great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>Works good, took about 3-4 weeks to get here.</li>
      <li>Gave it a 5 star because it holds on VERY good for $1.13 free shipment.</li>
      <li>these work amazing for my issues.</li>
      <li>It was good to use and it was good product  for cheap price.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;&#x27;t love it more!</li>
      <li>this product is very good at quality, almost hold on a day, and very invisible.</li>
      <li>These have been by far the best ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>it would stay on for a good 2 hours (IF LUCKY) and then come off.</li>
      <li>and I just love them~!No</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again though :D</li>
      <li>; The adorable packaging is covered with japanese/chinese writing on the front</li>
      <li>still could be better &#x3D;</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE this!!I am going to buy more soon~</li>
      <li>But regardless,I LOVE</li>
      <li>Cheap price</li>
      <li>It did not stick well, even on clean skin.</li>
      <li>I applied it on clean skin too.</li>
      <li>These stayed on the whole day and applying makeup on top was</li>
      <li>the tape itself is really good, and as soon as you get the hang of putting the tape on, it actually works quite well.</li>
      <li>Ships fast, good adhesion to the eyelid, looks very natural.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have super oily skin-</li>
      <li>but I am not having any success.  </li>
      <li>and we probably went through 15 pairs before we got one in the right spot,</li>
      <li>they are very helpful though!</li>
      <li>I am thinking about to getting more later.</li>
      <li>This worked and without finishing the whole thing, my eye had stayed the way I wanted it to for forever until I went into a hot climate area and the sweat</li>
      <li>but It got really easy after doing the second eye.</li>
      <li>but they didnt really stick onto my eyelid.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, it stays on for about like three to four hours and it starts to fall off your eyes around the edges, causing your eyes to get really itchy.</li>
      <li>The size was smaller than i expected which was kind of a shame.</li>
      <li>I live these.</li>
      <li>But still, 5 star for my first pair of double eyelid tape.</li>
      <li>Applying it at first was pretty hard</li>
      <li>i give it 4 stars because they dont last as long which kind of sucks</li>
      <li>I have tried many times to make this product work but it is very hard to keep it sticking on your eyes.</li>
      <li>this creates natural double eyelid.</li>

    <li> Sadly doesn&#x27;t work for me. I have 3 eyelid folds,however i bought this product hoping that this would fix my uneven eyelids. Gave it to a friend who had mono-lids and it worked great for her.</li>
    <li> i brought this product three times. They do work but does not stay for very long. (Depends on your skin type I guess) they are very helpful though! 😎</li>
    <li> This worked and without finishing the whole thing, my eye had stayed the way I wanted it to for forever until I went into a hot climate area and the sweat kinda just made my eye go back to normal :(</li>
    <li> It did not come with that little fork just as the description said. but the pack written in chinese that it suppose to contain that little fork. I just wondering why it does not come together though....  By the way, it does not last that long on my eyelid</li>
    <li> I have tried many times to make this product work but it is very hard to keep it sticking on your eyes. Look for another product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this purchase. When I received this product, it did not have the forked applicator with it. It did not stick well, even on clean skin.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work for ptosis of the eye.  They are too difficult to apply. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> These do not stick to your eyelids at all. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Cheap price and you get what you paid for. The glue doesn&#x27;t stick well and it is very obvious that you&#x27;re wearing the tape.</li>
    <li> Fadt shipping, great price. It Works reallygood ! Yiu shoyld put this before make up that way it&#x27;ll stay longer. I&#x27;ll buy them again in the future.</li>
    <li> Gave it a 5 star because it holds on VERY good for $1.13 free shipment. Too bad it was too small for my eyes. But still, 5 star for my first pair of double eyelid tape.</li>
    <li> I just got these today and decided to try 2 strips on my eyelids..and I just love them~!No it doesn&#x27;t come with the fork,but I didn&#x27;t expect it to~ &amp;#62;u&amp;#60; The adorable packaging is covered with japanese/chinese writing on the front and back~ I could understand part of it,but I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d need to know anything on there x3 Applying it at first was pretty hard considering I&#x27;ve never used it before,but It got really easy after doing the second eye.These stayed on the whole day and applying makeup on top was easy~!Well I&#x27;m guessing it depends on what type of makeup~ But regardless,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!I am going to buy more soon~</li>
    <li> I had a friend help me put them on and we probably went through 15 pairs before we got one in the right spot, but then they wouldn&#x27;t stay on. The applicator didn&#x27;t come with the strips, and that have made a difference.</li>
    <li> since i bought it i think it has the stick cause it shows in the picture but when i received it， its already open and i read it say inside with the stick and tell us how to use it with stick. so anyway i just feel like it lie to me and feel little bit sad about it</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick. it would stay on for a good 2 hours (IF LUCKY) and then come off. I applied it on clean skin too. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t order from this company , does not work</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy. Doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
    <li> It was good to use and it was good product  for cheap price. I am thinking about to getting more later.</li>
    <li> the tape itself is really good, and as soon as you get the hang of putting the tape on, it actually works quite well. HOWEVER, it stays on for about like three to four hours and it starts to fall off your eyes around the edges, causing your eyes to get really itchy. I don&#x27;t have super oily skin- I&#x27;ve never had oil problems with my skin.</li>
    <li> I wish there were negative stars to give. This product is cheaper than the price and I can not get anything out of this product: (1) they do not provide the fork applicator as the package claims, (2) no matter how well I cleaned my lids, the tape simply did not stick, (3) it is very difficult to remove a linear from this product.  I hope you do not buy the same frustration as I did.</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job and works great. Only complaint is the size. The size was smaller than i expected which was kind of a shame.</li>
    <li> This product is worse than I think, it has only 3 pieces which I think not only three of them. I feel like the seller told out some pieces. Also the box said include the stick but I didn&#x27;t see which means the seller took away.</li>
    <li> Great quality! I never wrote reviews, but have to give a five star rating on this one. Ships fast, good adhesion to the eyelid, looks very natural. Can&#x27;&#x27;t love it more!</li>
    <li> This is probably a product that works for some people and not for others. No matter how well I cleaned my lids this project simply wouldn&#x27;t stick.</li>
    <li> this product is very good at quality, almost hold on a day, and very invisible. this creates natural double eyelid.</li>
    <li> by fair the best eyelid tape i have purchased. i am a monolid and sort of have excess fat so one sided tape does not work for me. these work amazing for my issues. i give it 4 stars because they dont last as long which kind of sucks i think i wore them for about 3 hrs before they begin to somewhat show! I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again though :D</li>
    <li> maybe its because i have tough eyelids but they didnt really stick onto my eyelid. 1 in 5 times it worked. i had to cut the top part of because the shape was just so weird</li>
    <li> Works good, took about 3-4 weeks to get here. I wish it came with that applicator that was in the picture. It kept getting stuck to my fingers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but I cannot use it well.</li>
    <li> I live these. These have been by far the best ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> still could be better &#x3D; hard to get it to work....</li>
    <li> Need an instructional flyer, I have never used this product before but I am not having any success.  But I would like to have a demo, or pamphlet included to demonstrate.</li>
    <li> As crazy as this product seems it does the job.It is uncomfortable but despite that it really does work.</li>
