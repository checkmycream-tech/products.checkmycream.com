### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;There are plenty of options out there for cellulite cream, but I&#x27;m very happy with this one and will stick with it!</li>
      <li>But it has a wonderful smell, unlike some I have used..</li>
      <li>but I think this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for this problem.</li>
      <li>My best friend heard about this cream and gave me a bottle about 3 weeks ago and even though I have not been perfect about using twice a day I am already seeing some improvement, so I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
      <li>It works GREAT!</li>
      <li>but again, it does smell awesome.</li>
      <li>and I just had to write a review because I see my girl so happy after I bought it for her!</li>

      <li>In my opinion it&#x27;s nothing more than a good moisturizer...</li>
      <li>The smell is not too strong and the cream feels good when you put it on.</li>
      <li>so I do not have a fair and/or significant report on that usage yet, but it seems to be getting better!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a really healthy kind of girl and work out a lot.  </li>

      <li>My experience with most creams is that they over-promise results</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hopin to be able to tell a difference..</li>
      <li>On to looking for better one</li>
      <li>Glad I found it on amazon, because it is cheaper here</li>
      <li>While it is an extremely pleasant smelling lotion, it has done absolutely nothing for the areas I apply it</li>
      <li>More than I expected -- and the results have been wonderful!  </li>
      <li>Works really well, surprisingly.</li>
      <li>This cream was very moisturizing and smelled good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m seeing good results and I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was smooth and rubbed in easily.  </li>
      <li>It was so easy to apply and the results were fantastic.</li>
      <li>Great results in a short time.</li>
      <li>I dont know which of the two is making my cellulite slowly smooth out</li>
      <li>The shipping was good, it arrived early and well packaged...</li>
      <li>other people said here the cream smells really nice and feels nice on my skin, but most important is that it works.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m experiencing significant visible improvement of the texture and appearance of my skin.</li>

      <li>Smooth and silky, thank you so much for putting this product on Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unlike other cellulite creams I&#x27;ve tried, this one smells good.</li>
      <li>This cellulite cream is unbelievable great, it works really well!</li>
      <li>Used Finulite prior and it seemed to work better.  </li>
      <li>This product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cream consistently for a month now</li>
      <li>After a few weeks I can really tell a good difference.  </li>
      <li>The directions were pretty straight forward - just rub it in to where I wanted.</li>
      <li>I been doing dry brush and jergens firming and tighting lotion for a week now and seeing better results and its cheaper.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and it makes my skin super soft and firmer.</li>
      <li>Do you have large, like maybe 16 oz?</li>
      <li>I have to confess I was a little too, but seeing such great reviews I decided I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>Can any cellulite cream really do anything?  </li>
      <li>but it really seems to be smoothing out my skin.</li>
      <li>and I find this one to be very</li>
      <li>The pump doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work used the whole bottle no improvement.</li>
      <li>It shapes legs and makes them look much slimmer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d probably buy another bottle because it&#x27;s reasonably priced, and who knows...??</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really say it does much for cellulite as I have not been dutiful in applying.</li>
      <li>Was hoping it would take care of arm flab,but nothing so far !!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> did not live up to it&#x27;s claim.  to pricey for what it tried to promise, but did not deliver.  smelled good though.</li>
    <li> Nothing happened!!! I massaged with this wonder cream for days and night but no results! Another thing people ITS A SMALL BOTTLE, like if it was a sample for a week!</li>
    <li> Does not work greasy.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t work, only thing that is going to work to rid your legs of cellulite is exercise or surgery.  Don&#x27;t buy this and waste your money</li>
    <li> I have 3 kids and my body shows it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other cellulite creams I&#x27;ve tried, this one smells good. Others I&#x27;ve used in the past smell so bad I stopped using them. I&#x27;m a big fan of grapefruit scent, so you score another point there with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a month, but I&#x27;m already seeing results! Will be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smelling. I seem to see a bit of improvement, but if asked if I would buy it again, the answer would be &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t think there is any miracle cure for aging skin. I&#x27;m inclined to believe we can only get big changes when we change our eating habits and exercise.</li>
    <li> I have used several different cellulite creams over the years, this is the only one that has worked.  I have been using it less than a week and already see results. It works GREAT!</li>
    <li> Well, it has a pleasant aroma and it absorbs well.  Does it work?  I don&#x27;t see a diffference after one bottle applied as directed.  Maybe after a longer time?  The big question is do any of the cellutite creams really work?  Can any cellulite cream really do anything?  I&#x27;ve used several different ones and it makes me feel I&#x27;m doing something beneficial to use them, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen a real difference from any particular one of them.  But I think I see a bit of improvement after using various products over the past year.  Would I buy this one again - I&#x27;d probably buy another bottle because it&#x27;s reasonably priced, and who knows...??</li>
    <li> Never worked for me anyway, may have for others.</li>
    <li> This cream was very moisturizing and smelled good however I massaged it in twice a day until the bottle was empty and didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this after hearing that I was looking for something to help me get rid of the cellulite on my legs. The smell is not too strong and the cream feels good when you put it on. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue when you get dressed. It&#x27;s only been a short time but I think this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for this problem.</li>
    <li> this wasn&#x27;t for me so i don&#x27;t probably no anything about it. so ya i think it was good for whom i bought it for...</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, leaves skin silky and works nicely on skin bumps. Can&#x27;t really say it does much for cellulite as I have not been dutiful in applying.</li>
    <li> I recently lost 40lbs so had not only stubborn cellulite but stretch marks on the back of my legs. I&#x27;ve been using the cream consistently for a month now and it&#x27;s shown great results for both.  Much better than I expected!</li>
    <li> I have been using it twice a day and I don&#x27;t see any difference !  Very disappointed in it . Was hoping it would take care of arm flab,but nothing so far !!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the product and it is absolutely fantastic! More than I expected -- and the results have been wonderful!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have tried 3 different cellulite creams and they all work&lt;br /&gt;about the same. However, once you stop using them, the&lt;br /&gt;dimples come back.  Well who can afford to do that. This&lt;br /&gt;lotion was 3 times the price as all the rest, and not worth&lt;br /&gt;it. I found the Avon brand to be a better price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product.  Used Finulite prior and it seemed to work better.  I hoped to get away from using a different product for night and morning since I travel a lot and am always looking to consolidate.  This product was not it.</li>
    <li> Works really well, surprisingly. Smells delicious and really seems to reduce the appearance of cellulite on my thighs and stomach. BUT... VERY SMALL BOTTLES for the price.</li>
    <li> Does anti-cellulite cream even exist?</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream on the encouraging recommendation of a friend – and I concur!  My experience with most creams is that they over-promise results and I find this one to be very good!&lt;br /&gt;It is has a pleasant citrus-y smell, a creamy feeling and absorbs nicely into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to rub some cream into the backs of my hands, which have crepe-y look that seems to come along with the aging process. I have been amazed by how quickly the texture of my skin improved and tightened up. My hands feel very very smooth. I am continuing to use it with steadily improving results.  The brown “age” spots on my hands have lightened as well.&lt;br /&gt;My use of Firm First on cellulite was interrupted by traveling so I do not have a fair and/or significant report on that usage yet, but it seems to be getting better!</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvement in skin using tis product !</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the recommendation of another friend. Now I see why they recommended it. The ingredients are great, it is NOT greasy and it is working even in just a few days. I have applied it 2 times a day now for the past week..and I am already seeing results..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it..It smells nice too</li>
    <li> My hubby was skeptical when I bought this. He said stuff like this does not work.  I have to confess I was a little too, but seeing such great reviews I decided I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, he is now a believer.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other people said here the cream smells really nice and feels nice on my skin, but most important is that it works.  I&#x27;m seeing good results and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am telling all my friends about it.</li>
    <li> This product worked beyond my expectations.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how good this produce worked.  It was so easy to apply and the results were fantastic.</li>
    <li> I truly love my babies, but boy, is it hard to lose weight and get my nice and tight skin back after pregnancy.  Especially after the second one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a really healthy kind of girl and work out a lot.  I&#x27;ve been losing the pounds, but those cellulite bumps on my  thighs were driving me crazy because they just would not go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed Bianca Ferose uses a lot of organic ingredients so I decided to try it.  After a few weeks I can really tell a good difference.  Glad I found it on amazon, because it is cheaper here too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of options out there for cellulite cream, but I&#x27;m very happy with this one and will stick with it!</li>
    <li> You would think because you purchased and expensive cream it will work. WRONG!!! I didn&#x27;t see any results whatsoever. I&#x27;ve been using it as directed for a month now and Nothing! A total waste of my money! I advice no one to purchase this product. Save your money and diet and exercise instead.</li>
    <li> This is the best Cellulite Cream ever which I strongly recommend to all my clients in my own salon!</li>
    <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work very well but I did notice a slight improvement in cellulite. I won&#x27;t but it again though. I think there are better products out there.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as advertised.  one of the things I dislike the most about shopping online is receiving an item that does not match the description.  this one did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m experiencing significant visible improvement of the texture and appearance of my skin. Very nice consistency and coverage. Pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a week and I am definitely not satisfied. I do not have dimples and ripples like orange peel skin. I was looking more for a shaping cream that reduce water retention. Well this is definitely not it. I don&#x27;t see any result. In my opinion it&#x27;s nothing more than a good moisturizer... little expensive and not worth it. I wish I could find here in the US the cream that I used to buy in Italy, that one was amazing.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover the cellulite as expected. A waste of a $30 purchase. I was using it for tightening effects and used it every day for a month and saw no change. but again, it does smell awesome. So there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. I have been using it for about ten days. I noticed a difference after only 2-3 days. Skin on my thighs is smoother already.</li>
    <li> First time trying this product and have been pleasantly surprised.  Its thick but doesnt leave much residue.  Has a very pleasant light scent which smells yummy and when you look at the ingredients it makes sense.  Everything listed is organic.  Been using it for a couple weeks and to my surprise I have noticed improvement.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This seller delivered this product promptly and in perfect condition. Also the product seems to be incredible not only does it smell wonderful but it really seems to be smoothing out my skin. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and it makes my skin super soft and firmer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see the difference, and the lotion doesn&#x27;t make my leg feel silky. On to looking for better one</li>
    <li> Remember the headlines in which several Companies were getting fines for paying people to write false reviews? I think they missed this one! The shipping was good, it arrived early and well packaged...props to that (only reason why I gave it 2 stars). First off, It started reversing what my prior product was doing for me! I was mad that I saw absolutly zero improvement but instead watched myself get worse! More so, the pump broke. Day 2 and it just simply would not pump nomore...I tried every which way to get that pump to work and never managed to do it. It is really irritating that I had to unscrew the cap and wipe the product on my hands then redip. REALLY???I trusted the customer reviews and that is why I switched from NuElle Triple Action Anti Cellulite Concentrate. NuElle worked and it worked well, I thought maybe something a little more powerful would boost it, I WAS WRONG! I still had some NuElle left and I switched back and now I am again seeing results. NEVER AGAIN</li>
    <li> This cellulite cream is unbelievable great, it works really well! My cellulite was gone just after one week of usage. It shapes legs and makes them look much slimmer. It&#x27;s already my second bottle!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!!  Great results in a short time. I wish they made a bigger bottle...will have to order 2 next time!</li>
    <li> i bought this a couple months ago i used everyday until the bottle ran out. saw no difference. stick to leg workouts.</li>
    <li> chucksmom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many out there....But this worked for me. I hope it does for you...a little goes a long lomg way</li>
    <li> First of all I got this product super fast and my girl loves the smell and I have to admit it dose smell good. she puts a dab of it on her legs and it&#x27;s awesome because there is plenty of product to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silky smooth, great smell. she is working out now and her legs are looking great over the past few weeks. We both recommend this product to you and I just had to write a review because I see my girl so happy after I bought it for her! Try it you&#x27;ll see what I mean as soon as you try it on. Smooth and silky, thank you so much for putting this product on Amazon. we will buy some more soon :-)</li>
    <li> My best friend heard about this cream and gave me a bottle about 3 weeks ago and even though I have not been perfect about using twice a day I am already seeing some improvement, so I&#x27;m hooked.  Just got my second bottle so I thought I would come here and share my results!  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and she was delighted. It was the first cellulite cream she&#x27;s used that actually worked and without any allergic reaction. It contains lots of organic ingredients too. A wonderful mild scent. She is already half way through the first bottle and has asked me to reorder... I only wish they offered a selection of bottle sizes; hint, hint... Do you have large, like maybe 16 oz?</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as directed (morning and evening) for about three weeks. While it is an extremely pleasant smelling lotion, it has done absolutely nothing for the areas I apply it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that it works for people who are attempting to tighten loose skin from previous weight loss. I&#x27;ve never been overweight, have always been fit, and the cellulite I have is due to a genetic disposition to bad blood circulation. However, the reason for this product&#x27;s failure is speculation on my part - I have no proof of this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I have now started using a handheld massager and only after a day or two, I&#x27;ve definitely seen improvements using that. Again, though - that seems to be related to blood circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this lotion as directed simply because I spent money on it - but as of right now, it seems to have been a waste of money. Its one redeeming quality is the pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> So far ive been using this product for 3 weeks ive seen results nothing drastic but in my opinion I would defintley need another bottle to get rid of it completely (my cellulite is Bad) I also use this product along with the massage mitt I dont know which of the two is making my cellulite slowly smooth out but regardlessI will defintley purchase this product again only 4 stars because bottle is small :/</li>
    <li> I used only a few time so far, so can&#x27;t tell a difference yet.. But it has a wonderful smell, unlike some I have used.. I was impressed with them getting it to me so fast &amp; the intro price they offered it at.. I&#x27;m hopin to be able to tell a difference..It feels good when put on no greasy residue..</li>
    <li> Look there is no fast treatment for cellulite. And this is not one of them. I am small believe me but hoped it would help. Did not. Let&#x27;s all just save our money. But I was drawn in again. LOL</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything different in the appearance of the cellulite on the back of my thigh and I truly don&#x27;t have a lot to begin with.  I was just hoping this would make what little I have kinda disappear.  No such luck.  It was smooth and rubbed in easily.  Not greasy like some others I have tried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Seems like another cream.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. It was packaged quite nicely and easy to open. The directions were pretty straight forward - just rub it in to where I wanted. Obviously, since I just got this, I can’t report any miracles yet... It does have a pleasant feel to it when I rub it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t exactly double as a moisturizer, but it does have a slight moistening effect on the skin. Maybe it’s my mind playing tricks on me, but my skin does feel slightly tighter since I started using it. I’ll see if I can remember to come back and update my results in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this thing does the trick, I’ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work used the whole bottle no improvement. I have very little and it still the same. I been doing dry brush and jergens firming and tighting lotion for a week now and seeing better results and its cheaper.</li>
