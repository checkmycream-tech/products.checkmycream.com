      <li>Great smell and</li>
      <li>Great Product .</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
      <li>Good smell.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with fair skin, except maybe if you&#x27;ve already got a baseline tan.</li>
      <li>Very happy ;)</li>
      <li>gives you a nice tan and i feel protected</li>
      <li>However, I do love the smell</li>
      <li>I love this tanning spray.</li>
      <li>Always pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t know for sure if it causes breakouts</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, and no greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>Its not overly greasy and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, to look on the bright side of things, after my burns healed, I developed many freckles which now camouflage the lightness of my skin.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful and leaves the skin with a very bronzy natural looking tan.</li>
      <li>Variety of spf levels available for protection under all levels of sun.  </li>
      <li>And, since it&#x27;s permanent, I suppose I got my money&#x27;s worth. :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sort of like coating yourself in Crisco cooking oil and then expecting a light sunscreen to circumvent the cooking process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I liked the old SPF 6 better.  </li>
      <li>That said, it goes on like the original and doesn&#x27;t feel oily even though it is an oil.  </li>
      <li>As a spray, the distribution of oil is great, but when poured into your hand, it&#x27;s too easy to put it on too thick.</li>
      <li>I put fresh on every hour</li>
      <li>and I end up with a pretty tan color.</li>
      <li>Practically albino, really, and this consistently gets pointed out to me every summer.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful and amazingly biting flies hate it!</li>
      <li>i found that the product, while it is an oil, did not feel like it was very greasy.</li>
      <li>This is much thicker and the fragrance has changed.  </li>
      <li>so much.</li>
      <li>fast shipping</li>
      <li>I received fast.</li>
      <li>and I love the fact that it goes on and absorbs very quickly, not like regular tanning lotion, I love the oil.</li>
      <li>It has the same sunscreen smell and any other brand, which isn&#x27;t good.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Get a natural tan in a day!!</li>
      <li>I really expected this to make my skin really dark (i&#x27;m pretty fair skinned), but I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times and haven&#x27;t noticed much change.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get it near your hair.</li>

    <li> Have been buying this for years.  Always pleased with the results.  Gives you a great color and an all over even tan.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning spray. It smells wonderful and amazingly biting flies hate it! It helps me tan without the burning. Its not overly greasy and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be back again.....fast shipping</li>
    <li> Like the picture !!! very good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now and it&#x27;s night and day how tan I got. I put fresh on every hour and I didn&#x27;t burn after four hours at the beach. Very happy ;)</li>
    <li> I am extremely fair-skinned. Practically albino, really, and this consistently gets pointed out to me every summer. Well, a couple of years ago, I had had enough, so I purchased this, thinking I would not only not look like a cooked lobster after ten minutes of sun time, but that I would actually look like I had some melanin content in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so much. I didn&#x27;t realize how burned I was until I left the outdoors. I ended up getting a second-degree sunburn on my legs, and they were blistered badly and took a few weeks to heal. I applied the product as directed, too. But, I suppose to an extent, the spf cancels out the suntan-attracting oil content. It&#x27;s sort of like coating yourself in Crisco cooking oil and then expecting a light sunscreen to circumvent the cooking process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to look on the bright side of things, after my burns healed, I developed many freckles which now camouflage the lightness of my skin. And, since it&#x27;s permanent, I suppose I got my money&#x27;s worth. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, just be careful. If I get it in my head to try this again (not likely), I&#x27;ll just use an spf 100 with it. I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with fair skin, except maybe if you&#x27;ve already got a baseline tan. If not...well, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with embracing the pale!</li>
    <li> Excellent oil to get on the beach. I received fast. Perfect condition. As it appears in the photo. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m A fair/pale skin toned person who usually burns then peels whenever I try to get a little color but this stuff prevents all of that. I Put a little on and sun for about an hour and a half at a time and I end up with a pretty tan color. No sunburn! I Was scared to put any on my face because I dont want to break out and I don&#x27;t know for sure if it causes breakouts but I use the excess on my hands to rub across my forehead, nose and eye area and I still got a lil tan without breakouts plus gave me some protection from sun damage. I Recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great smell and my husband loves it.  Not too greasy and provides sun protection.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! Get a natural tan in a day!! Use it often and apply liberally. The smell is wonderful and leaves the skin with a very bronzy natural looking tan. Highly recommended. No orange fake tan here.</li>
    <li> I really expected this to make my skin really dark (i&#x27;m pretty fair skinned), but I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times and haven&#x27;t noticed much change. However, I do love the smell and I love the fact that it goes on and absorbs very quickly, not like regular tanning lotion, I love the oil.</li>
    <li> This summer, I used this oil, and it prevented me from burning but allowed me to get some color while at the beach. Unfortunately, the pump clogged on the first day and stopped working, so I had to take the cap off to pour the thick oil out to use it. As a spray, the distribution of oil is great, but when poured into your hand, it&#x27;s too easy to put it on too thick.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, and no greasy feeling.  Variety of spf levels available for protection under all levels of sun.  Great for the beach!</li>
    <li> my friend and i bought this product last summer and decided to go to the beach. i found that the product, while it is an oil, did not feel like it was very greasy. has a great smell to it and i will continue to use it for years to come@</li>
    <li> Great Product . I typically use a 30+ SPF and end up with &amp;#34;no color&amp;#34;  but also no sun concerns.&lt;br /&gt;This product allows me to get some color and still feel that I have some protection.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and at a great price!</li>
    <li> I liked the old SPF 6 better.  This is much thicker and the fragrance has changed.  The wife says it smells like coconut but it smells like ant spray to me.  That said, it goes on like the original and doesn&#x27;t feel oily even though it is an oil.  The fragrance is a disappointment but it is not very strong and I can live with it.</li>
    <li> Tans and protects. Good smell. Doesn&#x27;t leave an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; feeling. Would buy again. Spray mechanism would jam once in a while but no biggie.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t want to use this unless you are naked and can shower immediately after tanning...for the rest of us that wear clothes you won&#x27;t like it.  Don&#x27;t get it near your hair.</li>
    <li> everything was fine , thank you!!!</li>
    <li> gives you a nice tan and i feel protected</li>
    <li> Not the Hawaiian Tropic scent it should be. It has the same sunscreen smell and any other brand, which isn&#x27;t good.</li>
    <li> Awesome, not like the greasy oil !!</li>
