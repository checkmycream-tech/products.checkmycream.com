      <li>oh, and this is just amazing</li>
      <li>This is actually really effective.</li>
      <li>So, nail polish may be just as effective.</li>
      <li>Nice product</li>
      <li>This time around I&#x27;d stopped biting on my own, but I still had the urge to put my nails in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>think I like THUM better, although the reviews weren&#x27;t as good on that one.  </li>
      <li>but they look nice now</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think this would work.  </li>

      <li>Nice shine</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 19days clean!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to just pick off</li>
      <li>Mavala has a much more unbearable taste, but dries of kind of sticky.  </li>

      <li>Nothing has ever worked to even stunt my nail biting, which is more of an ADD thing than anything else...</li>
      <li>My nails started looking better within two days.</li>
      <li>I had to get creative in order to floss, eat wings, and avoided anything that was &amp;#34;finger licking&amp;#34</li>
      <li>He just cannot fall asleep without sucking his thumb, but that&#x27;s another problem:)</li>
      <li>Would be better if taste didn&#x27;t get on everything you touch, just fingers.</li>
      <li>Malava works much better...</li>
      <li>But I would contact the Manufacturer to make sure.</li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Hope to be free soon!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work, since I have tried many of these.&lt;br /&gt;However, it did work.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>but they did look better</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who has been biting her nails. Though she tried to remember not to bite her nails, she doesn&#x27;t even realize when she is doing it. This product has definitely made her aware of her habit. The taste is a deterrent (she makes a face just thinking about the taste) and now her nails are growing back! We reapply every 2-3 days. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> this was for my grandson.  It does seemed to be working great.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for my son. :(</li>
    <li> I have two children who are nail biters. I put this on them everyday for a week and we broke the habit! I don&#x27;t think I would have had to reapply that frequently either. It seemed to last and wasn&#x27;t noticible on their nails.  Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s good news and bad news with this.....&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, it tastes terrible.  I instruct my son to pay attention to the taste in his mouth and then scold his fingers for sneaking in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is that it goes on thick like regular nail polish, takes over a minute to dry and since it&#x27;s thick my kid spends a lot of time picking at it with his other fingernails.  THEN.. oh, and this is just amazing, he&#x27;s been biting so much that he actually got used to the taste.  I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be so surprised about any of this.  He&#x27;s following in my footsteps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I like THUM better, although the reviews weren&#x27;t as good on that one.  It dries fast and goes on thin.  It worked like a charm when I got my son to stop sucking his thumb.  That project was completed in less than two weeks.</li>
    <li> We just applied this for the first time today, so I can not yet report the results.  However, the purpose of this review is to make clear that this leaves a glossy (shiny) finish, like normal nail polish.</li>
    <li> Did not help at all. Basically served as a clear coat.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Barielle No Bite for my niece. After applying it, she did not bite her nails as long as the product was on her nails. Tasted awful so a success</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 19days clean!! Lol this stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> IT TASTES SO BAD I NEVER BIT MY NAILS AGAIN!</li>
    <li> So gross but really works</li>
    <li> Not too shiny.  It works well.  I would recommend to a friend, if I knew someone who bites their nails.</li>
    <li> My son who is 4 won&#x27;t bite his nails when I put this on! Works really good - would recommend !</li>
    <li> Even with repeated application before her nap and bedtime, our 33 months old daughter continues to suck her thumb to go to sleep. Disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Worked just as described. Not too bitter but enough of a taste to make you think twice about putting your fingers in your mouth.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t deter my 5 year old from biting at all. I was frustrated that this didn&#x27;t work. My hubby tried it and said it tasted very bitter, but if your child is determined they can get past the taste pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Great product. It tastes pretty horrid so it&#x27;s doing its job pretty well. Someone asked if it ever gives any issues to contact lens wearers? Well for me, I&#x27;m really careful about applying the polish only on my nail and not my cuticles, also I&#x27;ve avoided touching my nails since I have rubbed my nails on my lips subconsciously and the taste gets stuck to my lips so I&#x27;m guessing you should definitely avoid touching your lenses with your nails. But, if you&#x27;re careful and only apply/remove lenses with your fingertips you should be totally fine.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 days and so far I have not bitten my nails once. I have been a nail biter for as long as I remember so I am really hoping this is a cure to my bad habit. I am trying to not to get too excited since it has only been 2 days so far.   The taste reminds me of nail polish remover. It isn&#x27;t too terrible but it is enough to remind you not to bite your nails. The only problem is that anytime you touch your lips you will get the taste, so it does ruin finger foods a little bit. It also seems to wear off quickly so it needs to be reapplied every other day or so.</li>
    <li> The best. I&#x27;ve been using for 4 days and it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t taste anything, so didn&#x27;t deter me from biting my nails at all. Malava works much better... That is extremely unpleasant and will stop me every time!</li>
    <li> Works great just make sure you keep up on it even if they aren&#x27;t sucking there thumb bitting nails for at least a month</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No nasty chemicals like formalin! My 7 year old grandson used it for a week and his nail biting habit ended! He was the one to apply the polish to his nails. It had only a slight shine, nothing noticeable, and no smell to draw attention.  He&#x27;s so happy about not biting his nails anymore!</li>
    <li> chips easily, also cloudy on nails, I would not recommend or re-order</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this and the Mavala product. I find they both work well, I&#x27;m just too determined to bite. Between the two, I found the Mavala tasted the worst, but it also washed off way too easily, so that I had to apply multiple times a day. The Boriele, on the other hand, will stay for days after 1 application, however it doesn&#x27;t taste nearly as bad and is therefore less of a deterrant.</li>
    <li> 20 year habit gone. I now know what it feels like to have nails. For the first few days I was hesistant to even try biting my nails just for fear of the taste alone. then during a business meeting I bymistake started to, before any damage was done I had that terrible taste. its been 3 weeks now and I havent touched my nails. I&#x27;m a guy and I might have to go get a manicure.</li>
    <li> I got this for my step daughter b/c she is all ways eating her nails and I worry that kids at school will make fun of her mostly b/c my husbands friends r all ways teasing him about his fingers and the lack of nail he has on them so thy say his fingers look like something I can&#x27;t say here and I know their just playing but I do worry for my daughter so I got her this product so that she would stop eating her nails and so far so good her nails look great I can paint them b/c thy r long enough and well we r both very happy with Barielle no bite nail palish.</li>
    <li> In 1 month, this product has reversed an embarrassing 25-year habit. It dries to a matte finish, so it&#x27;s not noticeable to other people, and tastes awful, so it really keeps me from biting. As long as I re-apply every other day or so (especially during cold season when I wash my hands a million times a day), it works great. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am 27 years old and have been biting my nails since I was probably 5. I decided enough was enough because my nails would be bitten down looking terrible and gross, and occasionally would make my fingers bleed. As of the last year my nail buying got more and more active, frustrating my girlfriend so badly, I decided to pick this up on a whim via amazon.com and I am so happy I did.   At first I thought, I can&#x27;t imagine it working, I cannot imagine now chewing my nails. Well it&#x27;s been one week and I haven&#x27;t so much as put my fingers in my mouth since the first few hours of use. The taste and lingers with a very bad and rotten flavor sets your subconsience up with a memory it doesn&#x27;t want repeated.   I never imagined a day I&#x27;d stop, but now I am exactly one week into it today and zero biting, and I actually have nails! It&#x27;s so weird for me!  I absolutely recommend this product to anyone who bites their nails. You won&#x27;t regret it, if it worked for me I can only imagine it would work for anyone! The best part is, I have never felt anxious in any way while not biting my nails. It&#x27;s like my subconsience knows \\&quot;this isn&#x27;t an option anymore\\&quot;.   Get it, you&#x27;ll love it! Also it promotes nail growth, a huge benefit when you are chewed down to the nail cuticle!</li>
    <li> It was very nice. Thank you</li>
    <li> Product works well if you remember to reapply every couple days.  My daughter says it does make food taste bad as well.  It is helping her to stop biting her nails, so I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> great product if you use it.  bought it for my son and it works great, as long as I can get him to put it on.  Would only be better if they made it in a flat sheen.  He, for obvious reasons, doesn&#x27;t like that it is so shiny.  He feels like others can see it and will think he is wearing nail polish.  But it does work great!</li>
    <li> Really awesome nail polish to help stop nail biting, it goes on smooth, doesnt clump up, seems to help my nails grow faster, and tastes extremely nasty. I would recommend however the only downfall is you after to re-apply every few days because it wears off rather quickly and easily..</li>
    <li> I used to bite my nails as long as I can remember. Tried other products and a friend suggested this. This was magic, the  product is pretty potent and now its 2 years my nails have never looked like this before! I have suggested many of my friends and all of them have had positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value for money - 10&lt;br /&gt;Bitterness - 10 :) (So bitter that through boring meeting&#x27;s I try to get some on my tongue to keep awake)&lt;br /&gt;Warning - If you are going to enjoy a plate of nice tasty chicken wings be aware that you have this on your nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must buy if you are looking to quit biting nails!</li>
    <li> For my 7-year-old nail biting and thumb sucking daughter, this wasn&#x27;t bad tasting enough to deter her.  She said it did taste awful but her comment was &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t help it anyway!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May work for some, but didn&#x27;t for us.  :(</li>
    <li> Very good product and as a guy who bites his nails alot this works. I only put on like a small little dash since that is enough for me to taste it and stop biting. I also only put a little bit because ive noticed that you start to taste it on everything like food and even in the shower if i put alot on. This is still a pretty good product though.</li>
    <li> Very very pleased with the purchased. Every time I use it my nails are very bitter, sometimes I forget my nails have this product applied and I put my fingers on my mouth and it tastes awful. It lasts a couple of days then you have to use it again. I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Have had a nail biting problm all my life.  It was embarrasing and decided it had to stop.  This product does have a very nasty taste, which is what you want.  It appears like a thick clear nail polish.  The .5 fluid ounce bottle has enough for plenty of treatments.  I am doing quite well with this product. It has pretty much done as it promised.</li>
    <li> Stuff seems to work for the most part, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Okay stuff. It did work on my 5 yr old naughty girl!!!!!  This is expensive though.&lt;br /&gt;May need to reduce the price</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help me stop biting nails. Unfortunately, I did not find it as bad tasting as some of the other reviewers. It does stay on your nails for several days though, even through regular hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;I am also finding that I pick at my nails just as much (if not more then) then actually biting them. So this did not work out as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> would recommend to any nail biter  the bitter taste reminds you not to bite your nails it is an awakening</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for my 18 month old.  It must not be bitter enough to encourage him to stop sucking his finger.</li>
    <li> This product actually works.  I was really worried about my son biting/eating his nails.  I didn&#x27;t even want to look at his fingers because it looks so painful.  The mixed reviews were making me undecided but I thought with the price being reasonable; might as well give it a try.  The shipping was pretty fast.  I applied it on my son&#x27;s nails soon as I got it.  The smell was a bit strong but I didn&#x27;t mind.  After few days, he&#x27;s not biting his nails anymore and they started to grow.  According to him, it has a nasty taste. Happy mom.</li>
    <li> Im a horrible nail biter. To the point of them bleeding. This product is ok, at best. It doesnt honestly taste that bad and it is not strong enough. I was still biting at my nails without realizing it until I get a faint taste of bitter. Needs to be stronger.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. It tastes like s***..!</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter and in less than a week, she stopped biting her nails and they have grown back beautifully! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this along with Onyx Professional &amp;#34;Stop the Bite&amp;#34;. (written by Marc, not Marlow)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brush on well, dry very quickly, and add a slight shine to the nails.  I use them on my 8 year old daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barielle:&lt;br /&gt;  doesn&#x27;t peel/wear off easily;&lt;br /&gt;  is not as bitter as Onyx;&lt;br /&gt;  bitterness lasts for around 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;Onyx:&lt;br /&gt;  peels/wears off very easily;&lt;br /&gt;  is a lot more bitter than Barielle;&lt;br /&gt;  bitterness stays &amp;#34;nasty&amp;#34; at least until it physically wears off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brush on the Barielle, let it dry, then brush on the Onyx.  That way the first &#x27;finger-in-mouth&#x27; afterwards meets the very strong Onyx as a reminder, and while the Onyx tends to wear off after a couple days, the Barielle stays for at least a week.  Between the two, her nail chewing is pretty much stopped, except for an occasional slip.</li>
    <li> It did not serve its purpose. My daughter seem not to mind the taste and still continued thumb sucking and nail biting.</li>
    <li> works as advertised; didn&#x27;t notice the bad taste when flossing or eating finger food but definitely noticed it when I bit a nail.&lt;br /&gt;Nails are also growing faster! great product</li>
    <li> my  daughter  uses this  her nails are  so  short  she  uses this  and  it  smeels  bad  thank  god  she  found  this  online  and it  great  she  uses it  3 or  4 times  daily</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think this would work.  I have been biting my nails for probably close to 18 years and have tried so much to quit this terrible habit!  It only took one use of this to stop biting my nails.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it worked so fast.  The taste lingers in your mouth all day and basically ruins your taste for anything all day.  Its been almost 2 months since I have stopped biting my nails and I think the habit is finally gone for good, I&#x27;ve never been so pleased with a product!</li>
    <li> a lot wasted at the bottom, brush short</li>
    <li> It was good but it tastes awful when sipping any other kind of food! The taste stays on the nails !</li>
    <li> I have bitten my nails since I was 3 or 4 and am not approaching 40. Nothing has ever worked to even stunt my nail biting, which is more of an ADD thing than anything else...nothing to do, hey, let&#x27;s bite the nails...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, As long as I remember to keep this on the nails, it works great.  The main negative of it is that the polish leaves a very shiny residue when applied, and as a guy, that is more than a bit awkward when one works in a professional setting. I supposed that it is not as awkward as having torn up nails, so I live with it and am working on finally having fingernails again.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the nail biters its very bitter I was not able to eat with my hands because of this plus I had to stop feeding my nephew. So its not good for mothers who have to feed their child. I dont need it now my nails grew really fast because of this .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 3 &amp; 1/2 year old son.....still biting his fingernails....in the middle of cold and flu season....with the holidays approaching fast!! Aaaagggh!</li>
    <li> It it doesn&#x27;t work.my son steal bites his nail.</li>
    <li> use it as directed, every other day and it will work, great solution to this 23 yr old problem. thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this, hoping to solve 26 years of nail biting. WIth the nice packaging and good reviews I was looking forward to not eating my fingers anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a week of use, I was truly disappointed. This product has almost no taste and comes off easily with just repeated hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other better products sold here on Amazon that I had luck with later on.</li>
    <li> It taste terrible it worked for me.</li>
    <li> Worst tasting thing ever...Therefore it works great. I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for over 20 years and the thought of this taste put a stop to my nail biting habit.</li>
    <li> wish I had had this years ago.  thanks.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell much difference. Expected it to be more bitter.</li>
    <li> I was biting my nails for 17-18 years. Tried stopping a few times but never could until I tried Barielle No Bite!! I put it in and literally went 99.9% cold turkey. I quickly rewarded myself with buying a nice men&#x27;s nail grooming kit and that helps with staying away from biting. Must try!!! It works!!</li>
    <li> The taste is really disturbing, I have to be careful when eating finger foods otherwise I get punished for nothing. I&#x27;ve used for almost a month now, it&#x27;s definitely satisfied its no-bite garuntee but I haven&#x27;t seen any abnormal growth increase with my nails so....yeah. Overall I enjoy this product as long as a apply it as directed I am no long a biter. I&#x27;ve been a biter for over 10yrs. So it&#x27;s a blessing.</li>
    <li> So the no bite portion works.  Bitter taste without being overbearing.  Application is easy and it stays on for quite a while.  The only problem I have with the product is that is makes your nails &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34;.  Not ideal for a man in a professional environment, but then again neither was the nail biting.  I&#x27;ve since been applying with a toothpick under the nail and that&#x27;s been working very well.  I can&#x27;t comment on the pro-growth portion, but they are growing so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I stopped butting my nails. I&#x27;ve tried to quit before with Mavala, which is similar. Mavala has a much more unbearable taste, but dries of kind of sticky.  This dries of hard like clear nail polish, but I could fight through the pain if I really wanted to bite.  I recommend using Mavala initially, then switching to this later if you slip up and start biting again.</li>
    <li> Taste gets on finger foods that you eat. My daughter still goes back to biting her  nails, though once the bad taste wears out.</li>
    <li> Got it for my granddaughter who won&#x27;t stop sucking her fingers.  She would at first wash it off then just sucked it off.  The taste didn&#x27;t bother her like I thought it would.  I only used it twice since it never bothered her.</li>
    <li> I hate it. It does not work. It peels off your nail polish.</li>
    <li> Did not stop my 4 year old. She wouldn&#x27;t Bute it foe the first 12 hours it was on but after that the potency wore off just enough she would bite. I put this on every single night and she still kept biting. I put it on mine and at first it was awful but after a few hand washes it wasn&#x27;t bad. Unless you can do it twice a day or your habit isn&#x27;t too bad I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very helpful. I really wanted it to work</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, my three year old chewed it right off!</li>
    <li> Tastes awful. Not a lot required. Gives me a headache (whether from the mental habit withdrawal or the actual stuff I don&#x27;t know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A+, totally works as advertised. My nails started looking better within two days.</li>
    <li> I stopped biting my nails after using this product for a week. The taste that was left on my lips from biting my nails was very foul, so that reminded me to stop touching my nails. Nice product</li>
    <li> we used it on our kids to stop them from biting nails and sucking thumb. it worked great and tastes sour.</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes absolutely awful, and will definitely help keep your fingers out of your mouth! I have been a nail biter since I was a kid, and this is the first product I have had that I absolutely cannot stand the taste of, it stays on your lips and tongue forever, and you pretty much have to brush your teeth to get it out. My only complaint is that it goes on really shiny, so painting cuticles and around your nails looks a bit odd, and it make rough edges really noticeable. Also, guys probably don&#x27;t want their fingernails to be that shiny, although other brands have this problem too. However, this stuff WORKS! The taste will drive you crazy, there is no way for me to stand to bite even one nail. Finger foods may be difficult for a few weeks, but it is worth the end result.</li>
    <li> It works!!!&lt;br /&gt;My 2 year old boy has finally stopped bitting his nail.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Barielle</li>
    <li> Worked for my 10 year old.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s completely disgusting, and therefore absolutely effective. I&#x27;ve never had fingernails before...I feel like a new woman! I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the product and would recommend it to anyone who has never been able to grow fingernails before, despite keeping them painted, get manicures, etc.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails for the past 27 years- I say 27 cause I can&#x27;t ever remember not biting them. I want to quit the habit. I read quite a few articles on the habit and decided I need to do something, don&#x27;t want my nails to look gross for the rest of my life. I bought the product, shipped rather quickly. Applied the first night and took my first bite- yuck! Its been almost a week now and I haven&#x27;t bit my nails. Every time I bring a finger close to my mouth, I smell the polish and its an instant reminder to not do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as growth goes- not sure if its the actual product working, or just my lack of chewing off my nails. I&#x27;ll be able to tell next week. Some reviewers said the product doesn&#x27;t work and isn&#x27;t bitter- I think it will work differently for different people. I have a goal to achieve and this is a tool to aide me in that process. I apply every other day as the directions state. Only downside is that as a guy, it leaves a little bit of a sheen to the nails and also the smell of nail polish. I can deal with it, just a heads up for any guys trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only question is how to help the cuticles to go \\&quot;back to normal\\&quot; and not all bit up looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope all the other habitual nail biters can quit! Hope to be free soon!</li>
    <li> This is the 1st time EVER I have had my own nails! I am going tomorrow for my 2nd manicure! This product I AMAZING! I am 43yrs old &amp; never have had my own nails this length. As soon as they would start to show a line of white, I would hurry up &amp; get tips put on them &amp; have fake nails. I just can&#x27;t get over how awesome they are!! I am hooked! I used to use Sally Hansen No Nail Biter &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it &amp; stumbled on to this! So happy I did!!</li>
    <li> the bitter taste lasts even after you wash your hands. I have stopped biting my nails. Nice shine&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> It is really disappointing. It didn&#x27;t work with my two years old child. She sucked her thumb right after I applied it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tasted the stuff, but it must be terrible because my child has almost completely stopped biting her nails. You must put more on every couple of days. This was my mistake. I didn&#x27;t refresh and she chewed one off, but if used regularly it is very effective. I like that it is formaldehyde-free; this helps me feel safer using it. My child has chewed her nails for 5 years and since using this product has grown long enough nails that we have to clean them! Never thought I&#x27;d be happy about that. Ha! Would definitely recommend to others!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t know that to will looks very glossy :(</li>
    <li> My spoon is autistic and suffers from adhd, a side effect of his medicine and condition causes him to gnaw on his fingers consistently.  Once I applied the Barielle No Bite, the effects were immediate. I apply a coat every other day and have yet to see him chew his fingers again.</li>
    <li> The taste is not bad at all. Definitely non-preventative as far as nail biting. Does stay on for a couple days though.</li>
    <li> I have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember, really wanted to quit. Put this polish on, but did not really help.</li>
    <li> thank you!!! Finally a no bite solution that actually grows my nails too!!! thank yoU!!!</li>
    <li> Description says it is  invisible but it is very shiny and you can easily recognize the polish on nails. Also, description says intensely bitter while I found it very mild. Will go back to the one from CVS which is really invisible and very bitter.</li>
    <li> No Bite Pro Growth is a great product - however, nail biting has been going on for 20+ years so I may have to try another way - maybe hypnosis.</li>
    <li> After several attempts to stop my life long biting (I&#x27;m 52), I have found the right stuff! It has a taste that induces nausia. It stays on for two days at a time, and IT WORKS! It works so well that even when I don&#x27;t have it on, just the act of putting my fingers to my mouth induces naseia by association. If you are a cronic biter, THIS IS THE STUFF!</li>
    <li> Works great for my teen age kids!</li>
    <li> I suppose it depends on why you bought it. If you are trying to remind yourself not to nibble? ok. If you&#x27;re trying to stop a kid from sucking their thumb? It&#x27;s not enough. This isn&#x27;t technically marketed for that, so I gave it 3 stars. but, we&#x27;re APO and couldn&#x27;t get the other stuff mailed over, so we tried this. She thinks it&#x27;s gross, but she is able to ignore it.</li>
    <li> Working great!  I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for 35 years but haven&#x27;t in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many stop-biting products and this is probably the worst one yet.  I thought being more expensive it would work better but it barely had any taste.  I had to really chew on my nails to taste anything, most cases being too late to save the nail.  It didn&#x27;t work for me, and my son never complained of a bad taste after I put it on his nails.</li>
    <li> Okay I never wright review&#x27;s, but I will make an exception so everyone will feel like me! I have been biting my nails since i was 2 so for 16 years. Its a gross habit. Two weeks on this habit broken. It tastes AWFULL, your brain makes a quick connection not to bight.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that the taste of this product was terrible. I had tried \\&quot;Bite It\\&quot; and \\&quot;Thum\\&quot; in the past for my 8-year-old daughter. The taste of those products didn&#x27;t really encourage her to stop biting, and the only way I was able to help her control it in the past was making her wear gloves all the time. The problem with gloves is that I can&#x27;t make her wear them while she&#x27;s at school, and she has to take them off to eat or go to the bathroom, and then she forgets to put them back on. Her nail biting has gotten worse lately, so I decided to try another kind of nasty polish, hopefully bad-tasting enough to help her want to quit - or at least help encourage her to remember all the bribes I have offered her for stopping! I have a whole reward system for each time she lets me trim her nails, and I haven&#x27;t been able to trim them in months! Anyway, I asked her about this stuff after her first day wearing it, and she said it tastes pretty much the same as \\&quot;Bite It,\\&quot; (which we got at CVS pharmacy), and it&#x27;s not too bad. She just goes ahead and bites through the taste, even though I have been trying to apply it every day instead of every other day. So, as much as I wanted this product to work, it didn&#x27;t help us at all. I will have to try something else, and reinforce the glove rule in the meantime.</li>
    <li> I used this on my daughter and it works great within a week she was done biting her nails and now her nails are really long and beautiful.  She got so use to it she put it on herself to make sure her nails stay long :)</li>
    <li> Makes your nails look a little shiny, but it gets the job done if you are trying to stop biting your nails. Just remember to keep applying, because if you are like me then if you go 3 days without reapplying then you will go back to your bad habits.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it advertises and has been working great.  I am a very frequent nail biter and this has definitely helped me to reduce the amount that I bite.  The only issue I have with it, and why I did not give it 5 stars, is that the foul taste takes a couple of seconds to kick in.  This is just an issue because I will quickly bite at my nail doing some damage and then notice that I have started.  That bit of a delay is enough that I am still doing some damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the polish would be noticeable, especially since I am a guy, but I have yet to have a single person comment on it for the whole time I have been using it.</li>
    <li> Very good product for a chronic nail biter like me! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and its so weird actually having nails. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is how much it clings to other things, and by other things I mean pretty much everything you touch. It gets all over my lips from just touching them (I&#x27;m not biting I swear), I can hardly eat because it gets all over my food, and pretty much all day and all night all I&#x27;m tasting is this product. And it stays on for days at a time. You apply it once and you&#x27;ll still be tasting it three or four days later, no matter how much you shower or wash your hands. It&#x27;s pretty frustrating how easily it spreads around, but overall, I think it&#x27;s worth it to stop biting my nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for as long as I can remember.  When I had an office job, I wore acrylic nails because I was so self conscience about my nails.  I thought that would break the habit, but as soon as the acrylics came off, I started back.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks now and I have not bitten my nails once, which I consider amazing.  They look decent on their own for the first time in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how a small child might not be discouraged by the bitter taste, but for an adult like me who was doing it unconsciously.  The bitter taste is just the jolt you need to realize what you are doing and get your hands away from your mouth.  It does has a shiny appearance like clear polish, but I actually like it as they have a more manicured appearance.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years-when I get stressed out I bite by fingers and pick my cuticles. This acts like a clear polish and has a bitter taste-but not spicy like others I have tried. That said, the big drawback that I found with this is that it&#x27;s a REALLY BAD IDEA to eat finger foods with this on. Doritos, popcorn, anything that involves putting your fingers near your mouth. Even flossing your teeth is a nasty taste. It&#x27;s hard because until you have this on you don&#x27;t realize how often you put your fingers near your face. So I guess my warning is this helped me (an adult) to stop biting, or to realize I was biting, but it can make things unpleasant because it flakes off. You need to apply this every few days and it&#x27;s fine to use it with nail polish.</li>
    <li> I have been biting my nails since I have had teeth.  When I was younger, it was really bad, and my nail bed is stunted because of it.  For the past 7 years or so, I have been a bit on and off with the biting.  Pretty much boredom and stress bring on bouts of it, but currently I have not been biting.  I received this product and put it on this morning.  I absentmindedly put my finger to my lip and it tasted weird.  If I were in a biting stage right now, I do not think the taste of this product would deter me from biting.  However, the taste does bring my attention to my actions and reminds me not to put my fingers near my mouth, simply because it is unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not yet sure if the nail growth claims are true, but I do plan on using this daily.  Hopefully it helps with the growth and strength of my nails!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week, and so far it has done what I bought it to do. I am 33 and have bit my nails for as long as I can remember. I have tried to stop before, but found that I would start biting my nails when I was stressed or anxious without even realizing I was doing it. This product has a really bad, lingering taste, so it first makes me not want to bite my nails, then if I do I quickly notice I am doing it due to the horrible taste. The only thing is, I found that I need to apply it everyday because it chips pretty easily (at least on my nails). Also, it seems like my nails are a little more stronger than when I have tried to grow them out in the past- they used to grow but be pretty flimsy. I am hoping to just use this until I can get over the habit of biting my nails, so far it has helped me get on the path to doing that.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  Does not have much taste at all but peels off easily.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my soon to be 3 year old who was constantly biting her finger and toe nails. This has stopped her. Her nails look so nice and are actually growing out. The only downside is trying to remember to reapply every other day.</li>
    <li> When I received it, I saw that it wasn&#x27;t clear color, but yellow so I was worried. But once you put the stuff on your nails, it clears up and you can&#x27;t see anything.  Good product.</li>
    <li> My nails were the ugliest things in the world! I&#x27;ve been bitting them since I was a kid (Over 25 years) and they looked like I threw them in a grinder. After using this for 2 weeks I was cured from bitting. Now my nails look great! I&#x27;m not embarrassed to show them off.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work, since I have tried many of these.&lt;br /&gt;However, it did work. It tastes disgusting, and even if i hought of cheating after a couple days of not putting it on, it was still there!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the rare cases in which disgusting is actually good ;)</li>
    <li> Works well... very helpful in dealing with this nagging on-again, off-again habit.</li>
    <li> Product is Great!  Seller is Wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product really works!!. My nails are longer and healthier than they have ever been...:) I am so happy now!! thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. The bottle I got was actually Amber colored but still pretty clear. I not my nails all the time and gnawed my cuticles until I had peeling skin and hangnails...super gross. Manicures worked forms few days then I would gnaw off the paint, which actually made my teeth sore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tastes just gross enough...bad enough that if I licked my fingers to taste food i would realize I had it on and have to rinse out my mouth. This stuff goes on like half oil half polish so it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t smear but stays on there through hand washing like a varnish. Looks fine over polish. Don&#x27;t know whether it made my nails grow faster or that jus happened because I stopped putting them in my mouth but they look nice now and so do my cuticles! I apply every other day and this bottle will last at least another month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biting nails is so bad. People judge you by your hands, infections happen in fingers and in your mouth, it screws up your teeth, and it&#x27;s just EMBARASSING. I&#x27;m so happy with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. The taste is quite bitter, causing me to immediately stop when I try to bite my nails.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and leaves no smell.&lt;br /&gt;Applying it once every two days is enough, even with a shower inbetween, and there&#x27;s enough in that small bottle to last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to see if I fall back into my old patterns once I stop using it, but so far this has been very successful! Would definitely recommend this to anyone having a hard time breaking their habit by themselves.</li>
    <li> Maybe my son was more ready this time, but he has stopped biting his nails and sucking his thumb as far as I can see after just a few uses.  We have tried similar products in the past, but he always restarted.  They also seemed to help his nails grow better--they were split from constantly being in his mouth, but now look great!</li>
    <li> The taste was a little bitter but my son got used to the taste just a few days after i started applying it. Also, he was able to peel it of.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I just went from biting my nails to picking at them. (shh, don&#x27;t tell the other reviewers that&#x27;s an option)</li>
    <li> We bought it for our 3-year old and it did not work. She continues to bite her nails.</li>
    <li> no more nail biting, it worked!</li>
    <li> As a guy, it looks like I am wearing nail polish. Sometimes it hardens and leaves the nail looking weird if not put on correctly. The taste is bitter but not as bad as others I have tried, which is a small con. Nails do seem to grow a little better when using. No miracle though.</li>
    <li> Sometimes the bitter taste works and sometimes not, but the bottom line is that I&#x27;ve never gone this long without biting my nails. Weeks later, I still have to apply it periodically as a reminder but I consider myself cured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that my nail beds did heal and increase to normal size, which all healthcare workers said would not happen after so many years of damage.</li>
    <li> I was a nail biter for 30 years and that progressed to chewing/picking on my cuticles. It was such an embarrassing habit and it also made my nails and cuticle beds look horrific, not to mention the redness and pain that would come with it. This product has cured my nasty habit and I now have healthy nails and my cuticles are no longer non existent. I initially put it on my nails and all over my cuticles surrounding my entire nail bed. In the morning, I forgot I had it on and as soon as I put my finger up to my lips...bam!!! That taste is terrible and makes a grown woman grimace and gag like a 5 year old taking medicine. From then on I kept away from chewing and when I forgot, all it took was a quick touch to the lips to remind me to never do it again. However..the taste stayed for at least 3 weeks and I only applied it once! This may have been because I put it directly on my skin..but it did the job. I had to get creative in order to floss, eat wings, and avoided anything that was &amp;#34;finger licking&amp;#34; good. Very happy with this product! I only wish I had discovered it sooner!</li>
    <li> ive tried other no bite nail polishes and i like this one because i can eat foods with this one. I know it sounds gross but other no bite nail polish get on your food like french fries or carrots. So you cant eat with your hands at all. This one doesn&#x27;t do it as much, just don&#x27;t like your fingers. However, it peels off really easy, which is why i gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
    <li> Love this .... Thank you</li>
    <li> Good product. I&#x27;m using in conjunction with Hoof &amp;#34; Stop the Bite&amp;#34; .&lt;br /&gt;The taste stops me from wanting to put my fingers in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;No smell, just a nasty taste!</li>
    <li> The product does work and received within time indicated</li>
    <li> This is actually really effective. I&#x27;ve had a lot of products fail, before. This one really stays through handwashes, and everything.</li>
    <li> finally after years and years of biting my nails and skin off my fingers.... i have stopped. has a bitter taste to it that instantly makes me take my had out of my mouth! best part now my nails have grown! and they havent broken off! first time ever ive had my own nails i love it!&lt;br /&gt;also you cant tell its on! it dries clear! not shiny or dull you just cant see it! :) will deff recommend</li>
    <li> This product actually worked much better than I had originally anticipated. I&#x27;ve been dealing with onychophagia for well over a decade and it got to the point where my nail beds were bleeding and I was developing paronychia. I finally decided to buy this because I knew i had to try something. I have now had such good nail health that they&#x27;ve actually grown long enough to need clipping, and I have not clipped my nails in as long as I can remember. The urge to bite is more or less completely gone, but I still apply new coats every other day to be sure. I even had a knuckle that I would bite as well and applying the polish to that knuckle solved that problem as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a problem biting nails like I did, this may be the solution for you!</li>
    <li> Wow... works great.  I didn&#x27;t realize how many times I put my hands in my mouth until I put the No Bite on my nails.  With flu season approaching it will do the trick.  No hands in mouth.</li>
    <li> Worked far better than I thought it would. I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for most of my life. This stuff tastes awful so it&#x27;s a very good deterrent. Only problem is if you eat a lot of finger foods you&#x27;re going to end up with your fingers in your mouth or on your lips. It&#x27;s very easy to just pick off so you may have to keep reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this worked great for me, it didn&#x27;t work for a friend of ours who picked it off within an hour of putting it on because he couldn&#x27;t handle the taste while eating food. I told him to suck it up and use a fork, but he wouldn&#x27;t have it. If you think you&#x27;d be in the same boat as him this will just be a waste of money. If you&#x27;re willing to stick to it (or have a someone hold you down and reapply it) then it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This is basically just clear nail polish</li>
    <li> As a nail biter for the past 35 years I can honestly say this product worked terrific.  After three weeks of daily applications my nails look &#x27;normal&#x27; for the first time in my adult life.  This stuff tastes absolutely disgusting which you will notice when you bite after the first application. You will bite, trust me.. Tastes that bad. Really awful... After the first few days it&#x27;s almost like a light goes off in your head as you&#x27;re raising your fingers to your mouth saying \\&quot;don&#x27;t bite your nails stupid or you&#x27;re gonna taste that gross taste...\\&quot; After four or five nasty reminders your brain finally gets it.  Things you may need to get use to:  not pointing with your knuckles, horrific cuticles, and people who don&#x27;t care when you tell them you stopped biting your nails (because it is apparently normal.)  Again, it really worked for me....</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help my toddler stop chewing on her fingers and toes.  We applied a coat of this to her nails every other day, as recommended on the packaging and it did nothing.  My daughter was still biting just as much as before.  I asked her if her fingers tasted yucky and she said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not so bad&amp;#34;  I actually think that she started to acquire a taste for this stuff so we stopped using it.  I&#x27;m bummed.  After spending so much money on this, I would have thought that it would have really worked and been really bitter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a bad habit of biting my nails and I decided to do something about it and I bought this.  WOW.  You will not bite them while you are wearing this....you may unintentionally put your fingers in your mouth but you will regret it immediately!!  You even get punished if you happen to lick your fingers during your meal.  I stopped using after two weeks because I have will powered myself to not bite my nails....or else it goes back on!!  I have actually had to cut my nails with a nail clipper three times because they were actually too long!!  Never been able to say that before!</li>
    <li> Lasts. Helped when nothing else did. Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, I&#x27;ve been a nail biter since childhood and at one point I tried something like this product and it helped but when that ended, the biting started again. I recently got this a few weeks ago and have been good about manicure upkeep, applying at least once a week and it&#x27;s been doing the trick, curbing the biting and strengthening my nails! I highly reccomend but the only annoying problem is it starts to peel off after a few days</li>
    <li> Works great, does was it is supposed to. Be warned - eating, flossing, ect also becomes more challenging. Dont plan on having any finger food - you will taste the polish with each bite.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product.  My dog keep licking his front paws. Vet called it OCD.  After a year of frustration and antibiotics I used Barielle  3 times a day. It cured him 100%.</li>
    <li> It worked for me. I don&#x27;t know how to describe the taste. Chemically. Like earwax. Yeah, yeah, I know. You have no idea what earwax tastes like. You, a person who bites his/her nails has never itched your ear, rubbed it when it was sore, tried to get water out of it, or get it to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; with elevation change. And even though you bite your nails so bad that you need nasty flavored polish, you have never done any of those things and then bit your nail, thus tasting earwax. Anywho. It works. It does have a slightly yellow hue. The only problem is remembering to reapply. That, and the loss of enjoyment with finger foods.</li>
    <li> After twenty years of nail biting Ive finally found the way to break this bad habit! The polish lasts a couple of daysand the taste lingers so you musy deal with it long after the &amp;#34;satisfaction&amp;#34; of nibbling is gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for 25 years. Two weeks after using this product I&#x27;m cured. The taste is horrible and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Reviewed wrong item bought the nail biting polish for my grandson and from day one he has not put his fingers in his mouth....he is 19 and its a great find for the nail biters.  Sorry for the error, my previous commentary is in regard to the Barielle nail cream that has done wonders for me personally.. It was recomended by a friend who had her nail extensions removed and has been using the cream for almost a year with amazing results.  Again sorry for the confusion.</li>
    <li> Its a great starter product but my son is a serious nail biter and chew right through it.</li>
    <li> It definitely works. My daughter doesn&#x27;t like the taste &amp; she won&#x27;t bite her nails after its applied. BUT ....its hard to remember to apply it every 2 days. If I don&#x27;t reapply it every other day, she&#x27;ll start biting her nails instantly. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell to the Polish.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month,and I&#x27;ve pretty much kicked my 19 year old habit of biting my nails. When applied, this product looks very natural, and lasts for a good amount of time. The only thing I&#x27;d warn you about is that the taste will transfer onto whatever it touches (understandably so.) Also, be careful eating finger foods.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for my thee year old!</li>
    <li> I got this product 3 days ago and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. For a lot of the bad reviews, I read how its taste was not strong enough to keep people from biting their nails. The point is, the bad taste is supposed to remind you not to bite your nails... if you can&#x27;t stop even after tasting it then you have a bigger self control issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
    <li> Works Great! It tastes horrible but looks good painted on (not yellow like some other brands I have used). It also appears to last once painted and dries quickly. I use it over polish and it keeps the polish on much longer.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it does.  It tastes incredibly bitter, which is what you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My very sensitive six year old daughter lost her first tooth and we knew it was time to stop.  A wonderful letter from the Tooth Fairy congratulated her and gently asked her to take care of her new teeth by removing her thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our daughter did not want to have the polish on her thumb, who would if it tastes so bad.  The letter really helped us to encourage her to try.  It works!!</li>
    <li> Tastes like gasoline. Gets the job done. I will have nightmares about this stuff. Helped me stop biting my nails for the first time in 15 years.</li>
    <li> I am a horrible nail biter  (24/ F). I put this on my nails for a week or so on top of my polish and it got to the point where I had just gotten used to the bitter taste and stopped caring. Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> My mom would make me wear lace gloves to bed when I was very little (little enough not to just take off the gloves when she left the room). I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and still have the habit of biting my nails and skin near my nails. I can occassionally grow my nails out and like them but one day they all get bitten down till they hurt. I decided to try this product in an effort to have nice nails I can be proud of. I thought it might be a nuisance getting into food during preparation or my 5 year old would accidentally get a taste somehow. A week later, noone in my household even knows I&#x27;m using it. It smells just as bad as nail polish when applying but then just looks like a slightly shiny clear coat. Once it \\&quot;scraped off\\&quot; (another habit), after about 2 days, I noticed I started risking some biting and promptly reapplied the no-bite. It&#x27;s a great reminder. When I do get a taste of it, it&#x27;s bad but it&#x27;s not horrible or lingering. It&#x27;s bad enough to let you know it&#x27;s there and you just put your fingers near your mouth. So, it&#x27;s early in the process, but I felt compelled to write. I think it&#x27;s a good product that works for what it is supposed to do. I don&#x27;t feel that it is torture or cruel to use on children either, as long as it is not used as a punishment, and as long as they are old enough to understand they have a bad habit and this will help them overcome it by having a unpleasant taste that they will not like if they put their fingers near their mouth. I would buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> Even thought this does have a bit of a bitter taste, my son still chewed his nails. This just didn&#x27;t work for us. Sorry.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really deter my daughter from biting based on the taste, more from the shiny nail polish side.  So, nail polish may be just as effective.</li>
    <li> Works well, tastes awful.  Would be better if taste didn&#x27;t get on everything you touch, just fingers.</li>
    <li> works great but a bit spendy</li>
    <li> There are photos in my mothers album of me biting my nails as a baby so I&#x27;ve been biting my nails my entire life but after a week of using this product I quit and didn&#x27;t even need to use it anymore which was lucky because I left it down and my toddler opened it up and spilled it all over my bed.</li>
    <li> This really works.  My son cannot suck his thumb for 2-3 days after applying, and it has not gotten in the way of taste even when he eats with his hands. He just cannot fall asleep without sucking his thumb, but that&#x27;s another problem:)</li>
    <li> The bitter taste lasts for days.  I recommend it for people that have a problem with biting their nails.</li>
    <li> This also is a great nontoxic way to help get your child to quit sucking their thumb.  I heard some awful tips on how to get our daughter to give up her thumb, anywhere from hot sauce to duct taping gloves over her hands.  Anyway, when a friend mentioned how she stopped biting her nails, I looked this up and sure enough, in a few days of using this, our daughter broke the habit of sucking her thumb.  :)  We also used the book Thumb Love to help her not be upset over giving her thumb up too.  Over a year later, she is still done with the thumb.</li>
    <li> An amazing product its only been a week and i haven&#x27;t even even attempted to  bite my nails. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is that i can&#x27;t eat finger foods like barbecue while i  have it on or i will taste it that very unpleasant taste... i have been reapplying it every other day because i notice it peeling not sure is that&#x27;s something regular polish does but it definitely works and i will be getting this for my little sister as well</li>
    <li> Used it on both my 3.5 year old for nail biting and on my 2 year old for thumb sucking. Didn&#x27;t phase the baby and older one said \\&quot;that nail polish tastes icky as she continued to gnaw away :/...lol</li>
    <li> So we&#x27;ve tried this and another kind and it was no different.  My son is 7 and bites his nails and skin around all the time. He doesn&#x27;t like the taste, but after a day of washing hands and showering the taste isn&#x27;t there barely at least not enough to get him to stop.  We keep using it just hoping it will keep him remembering to stop.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t wash off easily. It reminds me that I need to keep my fingers OUT OF MY MOUTH. Nail biter since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;Great for little kids that bite their nails.&lt;br /&gt; Be careful of nut allergies I think there might be some association with nut products.But I would contact the Manufacturer to make sure.</li>
    <li> Hoof Stop The Bite  Try it. It&#x27;s stronger than this product and cheaper! Nail biter for 17 years. I&#x27;ve tried both products and kicked my habit with Hoof</li>
    <li> I have been a horrendous nail biter since I first had nails to bite- nothing ever worked for me. I tried this on a whim and am in shock at how well it works. The taste is strong and lingers in your mouth so it really reminds you not to bite. I&#x27;ve tried others that just tasted bad but really didn&#x27;t stop me- this stuff is so disgusting if my hands go anywhere near my mouth I&#x27;m completely grossed out and stop. It works! After three weeks my nails look great and I don&#x27;t even have the urge to bite them anymore. If it can help this compulsive nail biter it can help anyone. I just wish I had found it earlier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails for at least the past 15 years, and I decided I wanted to quit.  I&#x27;d tried before and sometimes was able to stop for a few months.  This time around I&#x27;d stopped biting on my own, but I still had the urge to put my nails in my mouth.  This stuff is pretty nasty, so it helps remind me to keep my fingers away.  Big problem for finger foods, though.  I keep a bottle around so if I find myself with a strong urge to chew I can put it on my nails &amp; keep from developing the habit again.  I definitely noticed that this stuff dried my nails out, though.  It&#x27;s a trade off.&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t say this will work for everyone, but it&#x27;s helped me out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my 5 year old, but worked on this 41 year old. I have had finger nails for 5 months now. I started getting back in the habit so used this again. Broke it again. I used it for 2 weeks and broke my habit for about 3 months at a time. You will never guess how many times you put even just a finger in your mouth, you will know it is using this stuff. Makes eating a challenge sometimes.</li>
    <li> My lifelong  habit of biting my nails has finally been conquered with this product. It looks just like clear polish and tastes awful.  I even bite my nails in my sleep if I drink coffee .  I keep trying to give up  coffee totally but sometimes slip back. Some mornings I wake up with this awful taste in my mouth and realize I have been attempting to chew  my nails in my sleep. BUT the nails don&#x27;t show it. With this product along with Nailtique Formular 2 ,  I  finally have nice strong nails for the first time in 50 years.</li>
    <li> Works better than I would have thought.  I can&#x27;t remember a time when I didnt bite or pick my nails.  It was a subconscious thing that would make me feel unconfortable when other people saw my nails.  After I got this no bite pro growth, I stopped immidiately. I think it worked for 2 reasons. One, the coat on the nail made my nails look nice.  Strange for a guy to say I feel like but they did look better and I didn&#x27;t want to chip off the polished look.  Also because I didn&#x27;t like the taste.  My one complaint is that the taste part didnt last me a full day, so if that&#x27;s the one thing that prevents you from biting, it will have to be reapplied.  I lapsed during the world cup as some of the games made me super nervous, but after I resumed and my nails are fully grown after only about a week and a half.  This works wonders.  I ordered it for my brother so I&#x27;m curious to see how it goes for him, who is just as bas as I was...</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; may not be the most accurate statement.  Something more like, &amp;#34;It is VERY effective.&amp;#34; would be better.  It was far more bitter than I expected (I had low expectations).  If you want to not bite your nails, go for this.</li>
    <li> My 2 years old daughter keeps sucking her finger I tried this product but it didn&#x27;t do any thing. It might work for You cause every person is different.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I dont bite my nails anymore</li>
</ol>
