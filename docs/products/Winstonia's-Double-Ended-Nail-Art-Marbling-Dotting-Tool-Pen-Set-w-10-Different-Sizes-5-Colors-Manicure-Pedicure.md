    <li> Sent to my grand-daughter. She loves them!!</li>
    <li> I received very quick, item just as shown.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with dotting tools, each one is a different&lt;br /&gt;size and they work great. Would order from again....</li>
    <li> Works better than expected. Able to make the cutest designs for myself and friends. Would recommend these for anyone that wants to amp up their nail art. Plus the carrying case makes it easy to keep them organized and in one place.</li>
    <li> I received the item very quickly and I&#x27;ve had so much fun using it. I&#x27;ve painted everything from polka dots to flowers on my finger and toe nails. I&#x27;ve even done some marbelizing. Great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent item, perfect for nail art.</li>
    <li> very professional looking...good quality.  They come in a nice case, and are well made.  I would buy more in the future for gifts.</li>
    <li> I love using these whenever I want to make some cool design. Highly recommend it to everyone. The price is amazing!</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. I didn&#x27;t expect for my dotting set to get to me as quick as it did. This is a very well made set. The pictures are an understatement...haha. The set is gorgeous in person and there&#x27;s 10 different sizes. It&#x27;s my first time using a dotting set and I&#x27;ve been pleased with it so far. :)</li>
    <li> I been wanting to buy this iteam for a long time, but I saw bad reviews complaining about all the sides were the same size. I want to clarify that im not taking about this seller. So then I saw this seller had great reviews so I decided to order this dotting tools and Im in love with this they have diffrent sizes the posabilities are endless, and the pauch were they come in is really nice, that way you dont loose them. Im so happy I order this. And I had no problems at all with the order or the seller I will difinatetly buy from this seller again. Thank you so much im a very happy costumer.</li>
    <li> These tools exceeded my expectations. They allow me to do so much more on my nails, I love them! The case/wrap they come in is very nice and these were delivered very quickly!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!! It just arrived way ahead of schedule and EACH END IS A DIFFERENT SIZE!! I didn&#x27;t get any of the same so I am very happy!</li>
    <li> Easy to make nails look great with these tools.  Glad I was able to find them, couldn&#x27;t find them locally.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a dotting tool and most of the reviews on other tools stated theirs came with same size ends even though the description  and photo stated otherwise. When I came to this one, it had the most positive reviews and I am glad I ordered it because it is exactly as described! I love using it to make fun designs and the ends are different sizes like the description states. It also came quickly and I love the cute pouch to hold them in. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I love these and you cant beat the price but one of them broke while i was using it for the first time.</li>
    <li> Like them but one end was broken when I opened it</li>
    <li> My 4 year old uses these for her nails &amp; loves being able to make pretty designs</li>
    <li> Even better in person. Great quality for very little money. Like the case they all go in. Sturdy little dotting tools. Easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I love this dotting tool set!&lt;br /&gt;The tools and the storage case look like they are quality made.&lt;br /&gt;The dots come in 10 sizes and the handles are quite pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas. She uses it all of the time.  Love all of the different sizes, she&#x27;s able to do a lot of different designs and is having a ;ot of fun with it.</li>
    <li> They are cheaply made</li>
    <li> Works great and love all the different sizes its able to create multiple designs but took while to ship though</li>
    <li> perfect for my nails ! i love this to bad i dont use it that much .. but its really a great deal and it came really fast !</li>
    <li> This is a great set of tools. All tips are different sizes, the case is perfect for storage. Ordered one for my daughter, and another for her coach. Great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> A little bit of background for y&#x27;all:&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE doing my nails and am doing them differently once a week, previously having Nail Ritz tools, I was disappointed to find they clog VERY easily (a warning for people who do fine prints).  Deciding to search on this lovely website, I saw a similar set to this one, only to read the reviews and see there was actually not the ten different points.  After that I was very cautious and eventually saw these beauties, reading reviews and approving -especially the lower cost than other sellers.  I just now got them today and am VERY VERY happy to see that these do in fact have ten different sizes and tips, the case and extremely fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Now I know who to check for nail stuff first!</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are perfect and the price is right! There are 10 different sized dots. The tools aren&#x27;t cheaply made. they are sturdy and came with a cute bag. The shipping was super fast and my order was well packed. I plan to purchase more sets as stocking stuffers for Christmas this year.</li>
    <li> Received super fast and exactly as described. These work great for me and they have a cute little storage case! Recommend for sure!</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! It was in expensive and great quality! The colors are pretty too!! Very pleased! Buy this product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It was cheaper to buy this and pay for shipping then buying them at Sally&#x27;s or another comparable place.  They are awesome and work great.</li>
    <li> The dotters themselves aren&#x27;t really that diverse. The less polish you used the smaller the dot. Save your money and push a sewing pin through a wood pencil with an eraser and you&#x27;ve got the same thing. You don&#x27;t need to even press hard or the polish will be missing from the center. Looks like a secret Santa gift this year because ain&#x27;t nobody got time to send it back.</li>
    <li> They arrived right on time and and looked just as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I have already used them a number of times and love having them in my nail kit.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for a satisfactory product!</li>
    <li> ive used them a few times.. They really do come in different sizes unlike the others on the internet. They work great, and the colors help you recognize each one. I use the purple for polka dot patterns bc its the perfect size. Will neveer regret buying these. ANd the case really helps keep them together wherever youre doing your nails. DONT DEBATE.. GET THEM! :)</li>
    <li> I have using these for about 3 months now and have enjoyed learning how to use them.  I have been very careful with them as 2 ends look cracked where the pieces go together.</li>
    <li> Love this set! The different sizes are great, lots of decorating options.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how it came in its own case. They were sized according to the dot size. Easy to put away and very cute colors. very happy</li>
    <li> Great product.  Arrived in a short amount of time, as promised.</li>
    <li> I received this product a day earlier than the expected arrival date and am extremely pleased with it. There are indeed ten different head sizes as advertised, and the tools themselves are a weight and shape that are easy to handle. I did have one loose head on the blue tool; however, this is easily remedied with some glue and a little patience. The case is a nice bonus as well. This product is a must-have for aspiring nail artists as well as professionals and well worth the $2 I spent!</li>
    <li> This was a great deal very good product for the price. For any one who is looking to do nail art it is a must have.</li>
    <li> I love these. They were cheap and work well.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and in perfect condition. 10 different sized dotters ranging from big to tiny. Love the case to keep them neat and organized. These cost a few dollars more than others found on amazon but the quality is top notch. I have used them several times and they work great. i will be buying again from Winstonia. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also: I bought a set of 5 brushes from Winstonia at the same price (but no case), and the brush set works great as well.</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend for Christmas and she absolutely loved them! These are fun to have when you love painting your nails with cool designs!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent I love it ,work great and it comes nicely wrapped in own case,I recommend it ,thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> Received as planned. Good product.</li>
    <li> 👍👍👍👍👍everything is perfect about this product</li>
    <li> I love these tools. I use them every time I work with my polymer clay. They&#x27;re great for so many things and help out a lot. They&#x27;re decent quality and the colors are so cute. The pouch is great and keeps my tools organized and out of the way, when I&#x27;m not using them.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and looks exactly like the picture overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this order</li>
    <li> Great dotting tools that work excellently for creating nail art. Comes with a convenient little case to keep everything organized.</li>
    <li> Ordered for a friend.  They are priced right and work to her satisfaction</li>
    <li> Amazing! Perfect tools for a perfect price!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, arrived well before time. Very pleased with the customer service, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails and so I got these dotting pens. I have to say I&#x27;m really happy with them! These really are 10 different sizes, which was my major concern because I saw other sellers item looking just like these but overlapping sizes. I&#x27;m glad I got those and do recommend this to anyone who wants to do nails themselves.</li>
    <li> I was wondering if they would indeed be 10 different sizes, as there are other sets that claim to be but aren&#x27;t. These are! They do what they should, and they&#x27;re very pretty as well. I like that they come in all different colors.</li>
    <li> This review is long overdue, but I just had to review it since I love this product so much! Getting this here on Amazon was certainly cheaper than buying it from a beauty store or craft store. I felt like I really got a bargain for a quality item. The dotting tools are aesthetically pleasing especially seeing it in person with the neat spirals twirling in the handle. There are 10 different sizes of dotters spread among 5 dotter handles and it&#x27;s just perfect for anything and everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this for nail art since I wanted to save money by doing my own nails. They work perfectly with nail polish. Just be sure to wipe it off quickly every time so clean up won&#x27;t be hard. I then started to using the dotting tools with my polymer clay charms. For those of you who do polymer clay charms, you know these things are life savers. I use it whenever I have to paint eyes or noses for charms that have faces are I use the dotters for indentations for detail. I have been using this for three years and it still looks like brand new from the day I purchased it. You can go from small dots to big dots and they make perfect dots every single time. I&#x27;ve even used it on craft things to make designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can&#x27;t go wrong with these tools. You don&#x27;t have to use it exclusively for nails, you can use it for other things as well which is awesome for me. I got more bang for my buck and I&#x27;m truly impressed by the quality I got for what little I paid for. I will definitely purchase more so I can have dotters specifically for a certain activity since I&#x27;m anal about these things lol.</li>
    <li> After spending weeks looking for a dotting tool set which actually has 10 different tip sizes I finally found this one. All the ones I had seen only have 5 or 6 different sizes (even when the description and photos state otherwise) and are missing the needle point entirely. This set is exactly what I needed and does, indeed, have 10 different tip sizes exactly as shown in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;The tools themselves are good quality, the case is also nice and useful for keeping things organized. In addition to their intended use for nail art, these are perfect for sculpting polymer clay miniatures as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also very happy with the fast shipping and great customer service. I will definitely buy from Winstonia again.</li>
    <li> it was exactly what my daughter wanted and it worked out great for her.  everything came like it said no problems.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and these are honestly the best things I have bought for my nails! They are so cute and easy to use! Awesome price too.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful and work well.  I have not used them all but the ones I have used feel great in the hand and are perfect for designing nails.  The included case keeps them safe and all in one place.  A must have for any nail art collection.</li>

The tools look sturdy and I used all of them for a dotting test with no problems.  I can&#x27;t wait to use these for my manicure, so far the options seem endless!</li>
    <li> One of the dotting tools was broken. The metal head came out of the plastic. I used super glue to fix it &amp; it works just fine now.

    <li> I was so pleased to actually receive ten different sizes on this dotting tool sold by Winstonia!!! I had purchased another set before this and only got four different sizes in all, and it wasn&#x27;t worth sending them back but searched until I found this one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!I wanted them in that pretty pink/purple color but these are pretty as well and I&#x27;d rather have working tools. They were, also, wrapped in bubble wrap and arrived 2 days after I ordered! You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> These guys are the real deal! Super quick delivery on an AMAZING product. Package arrived safe and sound, all 5 (with 10 diff sizes) tools in PERFECT condition! Looks EXACTLY like the picture, carrying case included! I cannot wait to start experimenting and enjoying these tools. Also provided coupon for 5% off ANY 1 item with special code, 10% off ANY 2 items with special code. Thank you so much Winstonia! I will DEFINITELY be ordering more in the future! B-) :-D</li>
    <li> this package came super fast, sooner than the estimated time, and the are a lot better quality than i had expected,i was expecting cheesy plastic that would just barely do, they are awesome and deffinately worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product this is my second purchase from winstonia and all my orders came in as I expected. there are no damages and has very good quality. now I can do designs on my nails and guests.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying my double-ended dotting tools! I received the product 3 days after ordering, good packaging--none of the tools were broken during shipping. I enjoy the different size tips and the cheery colors make nail art that much more fun! I would definitely recommend getting these tools, your nails will thank you!</li>
    <li> Product does what you would expect... They can be a little hard to work with sometimes but in general they&#x27;re a good product :)</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this purchase, delivery was on time will recommend to anyone interested in them.</li>
    <li> i love this product and it even arrived earlier than scheduled :) I will definitely buy more products from this store. These tools are easy to use too.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these.  It took a LONG time to get them...months. Once she received them, she loved them. Good product.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the picture , different sizes , nice wrap bag ,good price, I&#x27;m soon happy with it and can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I needed.  I love that there really are 10 different sizes.  The tools are well made and arived quickly.</li>
    <li> These dotting tools are great, they are well made and durable. They have 10 different dotting sizes from super tiny to extremely large. They come with a very convenient and professional looking black carrying case. And even though they aren&#x27;t available on prime I still had them in just a couple days from ordering.</li>
    <li> Great set to use for nail art.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought my dotting tool and within a month bought my best friend one too as we&#x27;re polishaholics.  She&#x27;s a cosmetologist and I&#x27;m the beauty school drop out.  The first time I used it my yellow dotting tool came apart from one end.  My friends is still in tact...a little disappointed, but still a fan of the product.  Have not used any others since due to fear of breaking, but I am sure that they are fine.</li>
    <li> Love the quality and arrived before the date given.</li>
    <li> I bought these quite a while ago. Had super fast shipping and got exactly what the description said. There were 5 dotting tools each with 2 ends. Had 10 DIFFERENT sized tips. These are great. Super cheap and work very well. SO much better than my home made dotting tools. (I&#x27;m sure many of you have seen the things showing how make them yourself)</li>
    <li> I love the sizes and the style. They make perfect dots on my mani&#x27;s, you just have to be sure to cleanse the tips of them well because it nail polish sticks onto it it&#x27;ll mess up the shape. Other than that they&#x27;re good tools!</li>
    <li> I am no nail artist, but I purchased these for doing nail decorating at home in order to save money on salon manicures.  They are sturdy and come in a variety of sizes.  The price was great, and is what initially attracted me to the product.  They are easy to use (though you may want to purchase a book or watch videos on how to use them if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with nail decorating).  Mine arrived before the delivery date, which is always a plus.  The carrying case keeps them neatly in one place and is small enough to fit in most purses.  Note;  When you use them, it&#x27;s a good idea to clean them with nail polish remover after using each color of nail polish.  I do this, and it&#x27;s perfectly safe; plus it keeps the tools in good condition.  I really enjoy this product and recommend it for any budding manicurist aged 8 and up.  It&#x27;s a really fun product at a really good price.</li>
    <li> These are great for the price</li>
