### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My tattoo looks great!</li>
      <li>To sum it up, if a lady has to knock one off and your Wrecking Balm system is within reach, it&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable alternative to your rabbit stashed in your closet.</li>
      <li>but, we are happy we found it, now!!  </li>
      <li>and he is happy about how well it works!  </li>
      <li>He has hear wonderful things about this product so we will wait and see for the results</li>
      <li>If you do the laser, use the article to find out which Q-switched lasers are best for the colors in your tattoo, and then Google search for providers in your state that have those lasers.</li>
      <li>We did not want to do laser so this seemed like a wonderful alternative.  </li>
      <li>Lol... I might finish off the rest of the cream</li>
      <li>You need to have a great deal of patience with this system, and use a medium pressure, fully expecting to not see any changes at all for months.</li>
      <li>It had a lot of great information in it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This will NOT get rid of your tattoos but it will lighten them greatly.</li>
      <li>the treatment made it bright and shiny....</li>
      <li>and I still have a tattoo, as bright as it ever was.  </li>
      <li>didnt work as good as i thought</li>
      <li>And so I would spend a good 15 minutes every night grinding away at that damn tattoo.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no way that it is going to do any good.</li>
      <li>Good Luck.</li>
      <li>they appear to be good at that....</li>
      <li>that ink is PERMANENT and to make sure you think before you ink!</li>
      <li>I can now no longer give any kind of recommendation to buy this product.</li>
      <li>How effective is the product when used as directed?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with my own at-home removal kit: a knife to scrape the tattoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my results that I have gotten so far.</li>
      <li>I researched the website, looked at very convincing before and after photos and was so excited about fading my husband&#x27;s tattoo.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m returning this if I can because I&#x27;m not in the slightest satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically a roller that numbs the area to make the laser more bearable.</li>
      <li>I bought a pumice stone that is doing a better job at removing the tatt.</li>
      <li>I know as I was able to talk my son into trying this</li>
      <li>okay.   </li>
      <li>This is ok in my book.</li>
      <li>Sure, I tried to talk her out of it</li>
      <li>Every evening I would apply the cream for her, telling her that the tattoo was looking better and better.</li>
      <li>When in fact it was fading more and more.</li>
      <li>I am expecting to go through most of the refills I purchased.</li>
      <li>It really works better than laser removal!!</li>
      <li>Maintenance of the abrasion head is easy.</li>
      <li>In the end, all we got was a roughed up patch of skin that healed very quickly and looked just as it did the day we started the process.  </li>
      <li>My tat was brand new (loved it until I had it colored in)</li>
      <li>I seem to handle it just fine.</li>
      <li>Seems to work just fine.</li>
      <li>It was a huge mistake that I regret.  </li>
      <li>and the instrument is also cheap..</li>
      <li>She confirmed what the article stated about surgery causing a scar.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells nice, cleans up well, and the lotion really helps the healing process.</li>
      <li>This kit consists of a mircodermabrasion like device that feels like you are using a light sand paper on your skin with a scrub like cleanser.</li>
      <li>Feel free to check out my portfolio on instagram frank_ifa  or google search</li>
      <li>I did a search for \\&quot;Q-switched Alexandrite\\&quot; (best for the color green) and \\&quot;Oregon\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I went from a pitch black tattoo to a gorgeous purple rose without anything showing through.</li>
      <li>I am pretty sure that is why another reviewer got darkened skin.</li>
      <li>, I dont think that could ever happen - but just looking to lighten it significantly so that I can have it covered up.</li>
      <li>Just please for the love of God, remove the unit that holds the abrasive pad first.  </li>
      <li>and I am seeing significant fading.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for my son, his Tattoos are fading right off!</li>
      <li>belief is that if you have a very superficial tattoo, Wrecking Balm might be able to help you.</li>
      <li>After a full course my tattoo was not faded.  </li>
      <li>What a great Christmas that was, you would get a better result than this if you just rubbed sandpaper on your tattoos, its pretty much the same thing.  </li>
      <li>I am not looking for full removal</li>
      <li>If it is very superficial, I would imagine you might see really quick results, and if it is deeper, you might have to work on this for a year or maybe more.</li>
      <li>My tattoo is a very light grey (having been done quickly by the \\&quot;artist\\&quot;) and is on thin skin which, if you believe the sales pitch, are ideal conditions for successful tattoo removal.     </li>
      <li>Since then I have gone through two more, and imagine I will have to contact them again for more abrasion heads before I am done using what is left of the abrasion liquid.</li>
      <li>Someone could easily sue their asses off for millions, and they could easily avoid that by simply sending these cheap, made in china, abrasion heads.</li>
      <li>For those who don&#x27;t want to read a long article, the basic summary of the article is that the Q-switched lasers are the best right now for tattoo removal.</li>
      <li>They also have two different kind of Q-switched lasers.</li>
      <li>That makes this system worth the pain</li>
      <li>It would be worth it, if there is no scarring.</li>
      <li>So instead of getting her something useful like a kindle or something, I got her this.  </li>
      <li>The cream smells really fresh though.</li>
      <li>recently contacted Wrecking Balm for some more abrasion head replacements and was informed I could no longer get any free replacements.</li>
      <li>Which brings me to my first point, which is not to buy this if you think you won&#x27;t be very consistent using it.</li>
      <li>After 6 months of use on my shoulder tattoo I had it light enough where I could easily get it covered.</li>
      <li>I think I tried to fill the well 50% and then just let the thing expand higher.</li>
      <li>If your tattoo is bigger, plan on buying more refills to handle that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A session with a dermatologist or a surgeon to remove a tattoo - actually remove it, will be around $200 or more depending on the size of the ink and skill of the surgeon.        </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve used it for longer than the minute and more often than everyother day as suggested I tried to go as suggested but no results and still no results after months of daily use.</li>
      <li>If you do want to try something other than this system to cause abrasion, make sure it won&#x27;t infect you, and that you can clean it out thoroughly after each use.</li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
      <li>To their credit they responded quickly to my email and sent me 4 new abrasion heads to make up for the two that had self destructed.</li>
      <li>started using the wrecking balm system more consistently (although not perfectly) and started to notice some more significant fading after about 4 months.</li>
      <li>I have not had the wrecking balm long enough to judge it fairly.</li>
      <li>So if you want to try this to really fade a tattoo....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to see how much the tattoo has faded by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is glued on there, and I think the way it is designed, or the type of glue they are using causes it to come off if too much pressure is used.</li>
      <li>My wife didn&#x27;t really want to get the tattoo removed.</li>
      <li>So she couldn&#x27;t really see the tattoo herself.</li>
      <li>my skin is now thicker around the tattoo thanks to wrecking balm and my tattoo hasn&#x27;t faded much.</li>
      <li>It really works and even quicker than all those trips costly trips for laser removal specialist.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your time and money!!!</li>
      <li>But I think it&#x27;s likely, if you don&#x27;t want scarring, you&#x27;d have to pay a significant amount for laser removal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Eventually I got more serious about it and purchased a couple refill kits (since my original bottle of abrasive liquid was 2/3 used up at that point), planning on really giving this a go.</li>
      <li>I made an appointment to talk to someone since I was told that they were currently having a free consultation deal (normally $90).</li>
      <li>But if it had gone down into that deeper layer, she didn&#x27;t think it would ever be able to fade the color.</li>
      <li>The price of this is Extremely to High</li>
      <li>Tried using it on a small old tattoo, looked like it was effective at first, but after repeated use (as directed) it healed and was not much different then when I first started.</li>
      <li>She said that it takes most people 6-10 treatments to see significant fading and that there are sometimes tiny spots that never will want to fade (color is too deep for the laser to reach it) and that there also might be tiny spots of scarring (she said she had never seen large amounts of scarring, just tiny spots)</li>
      <li>It was a little more agitating in the beginning, but I just skipped a few days and started up again, and my skin seemed to handle it better at that point.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor - if you really want that tattoo removed, save your money and go to a professional who knows what they&#x27;re doing.  </li>
      <li>I started using the abrasion head more firmly on my skin, and the abrasive part came off the plastic.</li>
      <li>got here the next day and it smelled like a tattoo shop upon opening the box which is always fun and relaxing...for me</li>
      <li>If I hadn&#x27;t read the article, I would not have known that there is a Q-switched laser that does much better for green.</li>
      <li>There may be some small spots that didn&#x27;t go deep and those may eventually fade over the course of many months of effort, but it won&#x27;t be worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My tattoo looks great! I have not had the wrecking balm long enough to judge it fairly. I&#x27;m very doubtful. It&#x27;s going to take months to fade, and even then, the examples on the box which are visible may have make up on them. I can use the make up to cover my tattoo without the wrecking balm.</li>
    <li> Seeing some fading after using for 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t even start to remove my Tattoo.  I was so hoping it would &amp; I would of kept buying it if had worked any. ,So DISAPPOINTED!!  :-(</li>
    <li> Everything was on point as was mention to me about the shipping and the item, thank you.</li>
    <li> I have a crappy tattoo on my spine that was done at someone&#x27;s house.  It was a huge mistake that I regret.  I have been noticing an improvement since I started and it is nearly faded away.  As long as you follow the directions and use pressure as the directions say- it works!  I&#x27;m very happy with my results that I have gotten so far.</li>
    <li> i bought this on ebay 149.95 dollars i sand it very hard extra time but nothing change my tattoo still dark</li>
    <li> I have a name tattooed on my breast (yes, like an idiot I did it) and it is a name. No colors, just plain ink. I have made my breast bloody over and over trying to scrap it off with the sandpaper included in this kit. I have screamed from pain and the burn afterwards of applying the gel that comes in this kit. I have tried and tried after spending my hard earned money on this hoax. My tattoo is there, all 6 letters of it and none of it is faded. I have taken photos of the tattoo at different stages. I have photos of my breast bloody and also with the scabs. I just took a photo yesterday and the tattoo is there plain as day, you can read it all and nothing has changed. I need to find a doctor to do a laser removal. Save your money. Seriously this does not work and I&#x27;m shocked amazon sells this product. It&#x27;s a total and complete scam. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> This is basically a dermal abrasion product.  If you were to buy sandpaper, pumice stone, some sort of scrub, a vibrator, and hand/skin lotion it would roughly be the same thing.         After a full course my tattoo was not faded.  A session with a dermatologist or a surgeon to remove a tattoo - actually remove it, will be around $200 or more depending on the size of the ink and skill of the surgeon.        This product did not work for me and I will not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe this scam that Wrecking Balm is selling.  I researched the website, looked at very convincing before and after photos and was so excited about fading my husband&#x27;s tattoo.  We did not want to do laser so this seemed like a wonderful alternative.  What a waste of $269.90 on 72 applications purchased in March 2010!  We followed the directions explicitly.  In the end, all we got was a roughed up patch of skin that healed very quickly and looked just as it did the day we started the process.  We are so disgusted and disappointed.  I will tell everyone I know (including other internet sites that ask people to rate the products) about this horrible waste of money and deceiving advertising that Wrecking Balm is marketing. Do not waste your time and money!!!</li>
    <li> Only got 2 stars for the delivery and the smell....got here the next day and it smelled like a tattoo shop upon opening the box which is always fun and relaxing...for me at least....anyway...on to the product....it&#x27;s a novelty product. It&#x27;s all pinned out for appeal but it&#x27;s lotion with dollar store creme and a fancy sticker for appeal...they appear to be good at that....and the instrument is also cheap.. I really did see the same one at the dollar store. So all in all... You&#x27;re paying for the name brand and that&#x27;s it... There&#x27;s no way that it is going to do any good. I had a few small pieces that I think I could probably scratch off or at times I think will wash off in the sink...the treatment made it bright and shiny....Like it just walked out the tattoo parlor.... So if you want to try this to really fade a tattoo.... Don&#x27;t cuz it won&#x27;t. But that&#x27;s another thing we need to remember folks....that ink is PERMANENT and to make sure you think before you ink!</li>
    <li> I was a little aprehensive when I ordered it; but the pictures and previous reviews gave me some hope. My tattoo was done in 2003 so it&#x27;s not old ink at all and maybe that&#x27;s why it won&#x27;t fade but I&#x27;ve used it for longer than the minute and more often than everyother day as suggested I tried to go as suggested but no results and still no results after months of daily use.</li>
    <li> The price of this is Extremely to High I got a kit at Wal-mart (local)for $60 not the $200 on here. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet guess it just depends on your tat and your skin</li>
    <li> No the product does not meet its expectations. Simple waste of money.</li>
    <li> I got a tattoo a while back by an amateur artist and badly wanted to take back the mistake i made in trusting him to ink my body. My fiance bought this removal kit at Walmart for $50. It was painful to begin with and it BARELY faded my tattoo. I was hoping this kit would have faded my tattoo enough for me to get a cover up job, but so far all it has done is cause the skin around my tattoo to darken and scar. my skin is now thicker around the tattoo thanks to wrecking balm and my tattoo hasn&#x27;t faded much. I&#x27;ve had better luck with my own at-home removal kit: a knife to scrape the tattoo. I&#x27;m returning this if I can because I&#x27;m not in the slightest satisfied with the results. Do yourself a favor and just try laser removal.</li>
    <li> I purchased my system at Wal-mart for probably $50 (can&#x27;t remember the exact price, it was so long ago). I got no results for a long time (a year?) but blame that on myself. You are supposed to use this system 3x a week for 45 seconds each time. I used mine once or twice a month just due to forgetting to use it. Which brings me to my first point, which is not to buy this if you think you won&#x27;t be very consistent using it. You will waste money because you will get zero results that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I got more serious about it and purchased a couple refill kits (since my original bottle of abrasive liquid was 2/3 used up at that point), planning on really giving this a go. I started using the abrasion head more firmly on my skin, and the abrasive part came off the plastic. It is glued on there, and I think the way it is designed, or the type of glue they are using causes it to come off if too much pressure is used. I looked up the wrecking balm company online and emailed them. To their credit they responded quickly to my email and sent me 4 new abrasion heads to make up for the two that had self destructed. Since then I have gone through two more, and imagine I will have to contact them again for more abrasion heads before I am done using what is left of the abrasion liquid. Which brings me to point #2, which is that you should not purchase this product if that would annoy you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the wrecking balm system more consistently (although not perfectly) and started to notice some more significant fading after about 4 months. You should note that in the beginning I saw no results at all. It takes time to wear down the surface of skin covering the tattoo, and I would not press super hard. I am pretty sure that is why another reviewer got darkened skin. You need to have a great deal of patience with this system, and use a medium pressure, fully expecting to not see any changes at all for months. My tattoo is about two inches tall and 1 inch wide. I am expecting to go through most of the refills I purchased. If your tattoo is bigger, plan on buying more refills to handle that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now the bottom half of the tattoo seems to be fading faster. I am not sure if that is because that is where I put more pressure while sanding on it. Probably. The black lines are going faster than the colors, interestingly enough. Certainly I still have a long way to go, but I am now optimistic since I am seeing some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would imagine that your results will depend on how deep your tattoo is in your skin. If it is very superficial, I would imagine you might see really quick results, and if it is deeper, you might have to work on this for a year or maybe more. Another reviewer noted that you could get it removed by a doctor for a few hundred bucks. I haven&#x27;t heard of this, but will need to check into that. It would be worth it, if there is no scarring. But I think it&#x27;s likely, if you don&#x27;t want scarring, you&#x27;d have to pay a significant amount for laser removal. That makes this system worth the pain it is (from a money saving stand point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the system, and if I ever manage to get the tattoo to completely disappear, I will update this review. I gave the system 2 stars because it is working. The removal of 3 stars is for the poorly designed abrasion head. I did not deduct any stars for the length of time it takes because I fully expected that. Tattoos are designed to be permanent, not easy to remove. Any system that can remove a tattoo without causing ugly scarring deserves some credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note - I did not have a problem with the pain factor of the abrasion head. Imagine using sandpaper and scrubbing at your skin for 45 seconds. It&#x27;s probably not as bad as that would be. It was a little more agitating in the beginning, but I just skipped a few days and started up again, and my skin seemed to handle it better at that point. Now I don&#x27;t have any agitated skin at all. I seem to handle it just fine. I would not do as another reviewer suggested and use anything to sand it down (such as regular sandpaper). Those products are not designed to be sanitary for the skin, they are designed for construction purposes. I would worry about infection in that case. If you do want to try something other than this system to cause abrasion, make sure it won&#x27;t infect you, and that you can clean it out thoroughly after each use. I don&#x27;t use the lotion that comes with the system, and have noticed no problems with healing. I basically use the system before I get in the shower, and then scrub the oil off my skin with basic soap. Seems to work just fine. Maintenance of the abrasion head is easy. Just put some liquid soap on it and wash the oily residue off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit on 8/4/12:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently contacted Wrecking Balm for some more abrasion head replacements and was informed I could no longer get any free replacements. I am now required to buy my replacements. (I&#x27;m not sure how much those cost since I deleted the email in anger - sorry for the inability to give you any info on that). Apparently 4 replacement heads is the max they will give to people. Since they have a defective product and are unwilling to make a change to their product so that it does not fall apart in the middle of use (and are apparently unwilling to give folks replacements to make up for their defective product) I have lowered my rating of this product from two stars to one. If I could give them zero stars I would. Their comment in their email was that if I used less of the liquid, the abrasion head would last longer. I have gone through months of using less liquid because I was trying to be cheap and stretch the product for as long as possible, and still the abrasion heads fall apart. That comment is ridiculous, and simply a company trying to get out of being responsible. They should be ashamed of themselves. Honestly, I think this decision is really stupid.Someone could easily sue their asses off for millions, and they could easily avoid that by simply sending these cheap, made in china, abrasion heads. But I am not the CEO of this company. If I was, I would have had the problem fixed, and new improved abrasion heads sent to every one who needed them. I can now no longer give any kind of recommendation to buy this product. AVOID!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit on 3-12-13***&lt;br /&gt;Recently I found a government document on laser tattoo removal. It had a lot of great information in it. I would provide the link here, but Amazon tends to delete links in reviews, so you&#x27;ll have to Google it if you want to read it. Copy and paste the keywords \\&quot;PMCID: PMC2884836\\&quot; and you will find the article. It is called \\&quot;Lasers in Plastic Surgery\\&quot; by Eric F. Bernstein, MD.  For those who don&#x27;t want to read a long article, the basic summary of the article is that the Q-switched lasers are the best right now for tattoo removal. I did a search for \\&quot;Q-switched Alexandrite\\&quot; (best for the color green) and \\&quot;Oregon\\&quot; since that is where I live and found two results. The first business only had one of the Q-switched lasers and stated on their site that it was difficult to remove the color green. If I hadn&#x27;t read the article, I would not have known that there is a Q-switched laser that does much better for green. So I contacted the other which wound up being Oregon Health Sciences University. They provide tattoo removal at that university. They also have two different kind of Q-switched lasers. I made an appointment to talk to someone since I was told that they were currently having a free consultation deal (normally $90). I found the consultation to be informative. She confirmed what the article stated about surgery causing a scar. She expanded on it by saying that if you have a tattoo that is the size of a quarter they will have to cut a scar that is 3x the length of that quarter in order to tie the pieces of skin together. Additionally, if you have a tattoo that is at a bend somewhere, the stretching will cause that scar to expand in width. I told her I had been using the Wrecking Balm and had seen some erosion of the coloring but that it was taking forever. She said that that type of system could fade the colors only if the tattoo had not gone deep into a deeper level of the epidermis. But if it had gone down into that deeper layer, she didn&#x27;t think it would ever be able to fade the color. I considered the locations where I was seeing fading. It was the black outline of the tattoo, and in a couple of different spots for the color. It is possible that the tattoo artist didn&#x27;t go as deep while sketching out the outline, and could have gone light on a few spots of color as well. If that was the case, then I could have been trying to use that system for a very long time and not seen much more improvement other than at those specific locations. I was very grateful that my tattoo was small because the treatment was very expensive. Small tattoos cost $250 per session, medium cost $400, and large tattoos cost $750+. She said that it takes most people 6-10 treatments to see significant fading and that there are sometimes tiny spots that never will want to fade (color is too deep for the laser to reach it) and that there also might be tiny spots of scarring (she said she had never seen large amounts of scarring, just tiny spots), there was also a slight potential for discoloration, and that there also was a chance that the tattoo would just not fade to the degree that it would satisfy the customer. This basically means that if you decided laser was the way to go (and if OHSU is charging a standard amount compared to the rest of the country) that you should budget about ($1500-$2500 for a small tattoo removal). I also asked if the amount of fading I had done already would help reduce the number of sessions I would have to pay for and she said no. That the color was deep in there and that the laser would affect it the same as if Ihad not been sanding at it forever. I decided to try a treatment and it did not take very long. Perhaps 10 minutes? It did hurt. It has been a long time since I got my tattoo, but based on a shaky memory, I think it hurt more than it did to get my tattoo. She started off by hitting the laser on my skin once to see how it took, and also to let me see if I could handle the pain. I thought it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but then when she got going it was like sharp snaps one after the other. I had to grit my teeth to handle it and then after a minute I asked for the ice treatment she had mentioned. It&#x27;s basically a roller that numbs the area to make the laser more bearable. At first the ice seemed so intense it was almost not worth it. But then my skin must have started numbing up enough and it helped a little. It still hurt. Fortunately, there was only a minor irritation I had to deal with after the treatment for the rest of the day. I&#x27;ll have to keep the tattoo covered in petroleum and a gauze pad for a few days and then in 4-6 weeks I can think if I want to get another treatment. I&#x27;ll have to see how much the tattoo has faded by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My belief is that if you have a very superficial tattoo, Wrecking Balm might be able to help you. I would not spend money on the refills, though. If one of your abrasion heads falls apart, pull the foam backing off, use a tissue with some rubbing alcohol on it to remove the residual adhesive on both the plastic base and the back of the sand paper part, and then use a very tough glue (I think I used gorilla glue) to glue the pad back on. The thing with gorilla glue is it expands when it dries. I think I tried to fill the well 50% and then just let the thing expand higher. I should have kept an eye on it because it expanded with one side higher than the other, but it still worked. I didn&#x27;t have a problem washing it with soap and water for a month before I decided to go the laser route. You might want to buy an oil (that is hygienic for your skin) to go with it if you don&#x27;t get a refill kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, on the other hand, you got yours professionally tattooed, I think it&#x27;s likely that a majority of the tattoo is probably deep enough that this system will do very little for you. There may be some small spots that didn&#x27;t go deep and those may eventually fade over the course of many months of effort, but it won&#x27;t be worth it. Your other options are surgical (scarring) or paying a ton of money to get laser. If you do the laser, use the article to find out which Q-switched lasers are best for the colors in your tattoo, and then Google search for providers in your state that have those lasers. If they don&#x27;t have the lasers you need, I personally don&#x27;t see the point in giving them all of that money for leaving one or two colors behind.</li>
    <li> Put simply, this product did not work. The before and after photos I took are identical, despite following the directions. My tattoo is a very light grey (having been done quickly by the \\&quot;artist\\&quot;) and is on thin skin which, if you believe the sales pitch, are ideal conditions for successful tattoo removal.     I scrubbed long enough and hard enough to fully detach two of the abraisive pads from their heads, and had to glue them back on. I used the product for the recommended 45 seconds, and then tried up to two minutes, both with the same effect... Nothing.    I have warned others away from this, and will continue to do so. The bottom line: DO NOT TRUST PRODUCTS WITHOUT OPEN REVIEW SYSTEMS ON THIER WEBSITES!</li>
    <li> Just thought I would write in because Ive heard alot of negative things about wrecking balm on the internet.  However, I have to say that I have been using it for approx 4 weeks now and I am seeing results.  My tat was brand new (loved it until I had it colored in) and I am seeing significant fading.  I think it all depends on the type of skin you have and how well it responds to the method you use.  I am not looking for full removal, I dont think that could ever happen - but just looking to lighten it significantly so that I can have it covered up.</li>
    <li> Doesn t work at all !!!! Keep your money</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money</li>
    <li> I have an abdominal tattoo I want to get rid of. I started using wrecking balm. I followed the instructions to an extent. In order to see results of my tattoo fading I had to pull my skin tight while I was using the suffusing gel and machine. It feels like sand paper grinding against your skin I used the machine for 1 minute per area of my tattoo. It burns a little but I rinsed with cold/cool water,patted dry and I apply the hydravescent cream daily. I can see my tattoo fading slowly but surely.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who wanted to remove a tattoo from just above her buttocks. I believe they call it a tramp stamp. The tattoo said \\&quot;Ronnie\\&quot;, which is the name of one of her ex boyfriends. So you can understand how I decided to spend the money on getting that damn tattoo removed.   My wife didn&#x27;t really want to get the tattoo removed. Although she denied it, I think she was still into this \\&quot;Ronnie\\&quot; character. She would always visit him in jail, as well as send him letters and pictures.   So I found this product at a local Wegmans. I didn&#x27;t tell my wife what it was, instead explaining to her that it was tattoo enhancement cream. I told her it would sting a little, but that was just the stuff doing its job.   Now, you have to understand that my wife is a big girl. Let&#x27;s just say that she constantly wears jogging pants and refers to them as them as her pants. So she couldn&#x27;t really see the tattoo herself. Even when she tried to use a mirror, it was hard to make out. So I thought everything would turn out okay.   Well, the cream worked. Every evening I would apply the cream for her, telling her that the tattoo was looking better and better. When in fact it was fading more and more. I told her that the micro dermabrasion thingy was actually a tattoo polisher. And so I would spend a good 15 minutes every night grinding away at that damn tattoo. And it was almost gone entirely.  Then Ronnie got out of jail. It turns out my suspicions were correct. My wife still had a thing for him. I came home from work one evening to find Ronnie and my wife hanging out on the couch. And boy did they look pissed. And Ronnie was a pretty tough looking guy.   Apparently, and I&#x27;m not trying to insinuate anything here, somehow Ronnie had noticed the now bare space just above my wife&#x27;s buttocks and had asked her about it. And now he was pissed off because he had bought her the tattoo to begin with. And she was pissed off as well because I had tricked her into having her tattoo removed.Long story short, I had the option of getting my ass kicked, or of buying a new tattoo. So we went to the tattoo place, shelled out the cash for a new tattoo, and winced the entire time as Ronnie and my wife watched me get the words \\&quot;Ronnie&#x27;s Bitch\\&quot; tattooed on my chest.   Since then my wife has kicked me out. And Ronnie is now living in my house. And me, I&#x27;m on my second tube of wrecking balm tattoo fade system. I can&#x27;t tell you enough how much I like this product.</li>
    <li> For what you pay, it works well. Iv been using it for a week and it is fading my tattoo on the side of my finger (already was faded a lot). I use it for 2-3min every other day instead of 1min. Hopefully it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using this product only because I&#x27;ve been so busy with the Holiday season, but judging from the three applications, my tattoo has faded quite a bit. It does sting a bit, but that&#x27;s to be expected. It&#x27;s not that bad, though.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, cleans up well, and the lotion really helps the healing process.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this for over 6 months, 3 times a week- no change what so ever. Three boxes later, I have the same tattoo as before. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> This product did not do anything to a small tattoo.  I would not recommend purchasing at all.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son, his Tattoos are fading right off!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim from walmart.  It does not work and I do not recommend anybody waste their money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like advertised.</li>
    <li> This product DOES NOT WORK!  Do not waste your money.  I used it for months and had zero results. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> I too followed all the hype. Have a tatt that didn&#x27;t sit well with me and after reading all the ad&#x27;s I put out the money for this product. well after using all of it, and taking pictures to see if there was a difference I was PO&#x27;d. Do not believe all that is said about this product. I bought a pumice stone that is doing a better job at removing the tatt. I can already see some fading in half the time of using wrecking balm.  Good Luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as directed for a month now and no change at all. Painful and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The name of this product says it all, its a wreck.  It&#x27;s total crap, and I mean, I knew it was going to be crap but my girlfriend wanted it.  Sure, I tried to talk her out of it but she insisted that this is what she wanted for Christmas.  So instead of getting her something useful like a kindle or something, I got her this.  What a great Christmas that was, you would get a better result than this if you just rubbed sandpaper on your tattoos, its pretty much the same thing.  Most of the reviews here are already talking about how crappy this product is, LISTEN TO THEM, and as for the 5 star review I wouldnt be surprised if they worked for this company, its a complete waste of money, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the wrecking balm kit for about two years now on some really poorly done tattoos of mine. This kit consists of a mircodermabrasion like device that feels like you are using a light sand paper on your skin with a scrub like cleanser. I used it 3 times a week for 60seconds at a time on each tattoo. After each treatment you use the second bottle that is like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will NOT get rid of your tattoos but it will lighten them greatly. After 6 months of use on my shoulder tattoo I had it light enough where I could easily get it covered. I went from a pitch black tattoo to a gorgeous purple rose without anything showing through. My artist asked how I got my old tattoo to lighten up and I told him about the wrecking balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest this anyone who is just looking to lighten up a tattoo to get it covered or even to save money if you plan to get it removed since this takes pigment out.</li>
    <li> How effective is the product when used as directed? I&#x27;m not seeing results yet; may be too soon.</li>
    <li> I have had clients waste their hard earned on money on this bogus crap. If your in the Los Angeles area, I would love to cover up your past mistakes. Feel free to check out my portfolio on instagram frank_ifa  or google search us InkFiendArt tattoos Thank you</li>
    <li> didnt work as good as i thought</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. The only thing that semi works is the concealer. Don&#x27;t get a tattoo u will regret!</li>
    <li> Maybe it does not work well with my skin color. I do not see any difference.</li>
    <li> Used for 5 weeks stung a little, but never faded. The cream smells really fresh though. Lol... I might finish off the rest of the cream but i dought any results will come, considering 5 weeks of treatment lead to nothing. Well nothing but irritation from it scabbing.</li>
    <li> First of all I have had this for only 2 weeks. I understand that it takes 3 months to fade out. This is ok in my book. Now here is the stinker. The sand paper pad fell off today. I will have to glue it back on. Most inconvenient. I still will use this product for 3 months. If it doesn&#x27;t show any results within this time, I will not use it again. In doubt,Terry C.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this is a total scam.  I used at least 3 rounds of this stuff and I still have a tattoo, as bright as it ever was.  Do yourself a favor - if you really want that tattoo removed, save your money and go to a professional who knows what they&#x27;re doing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this crap.</li>
    <li> I have bought this for my son. he has not tried it yet but will do soon. He has hear wonderful things about this product so we will wait and see for the results</li>
    <li> Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on laser surgery for removal of tattoos, not to mention, all the trips to the specialist for a 2 seconds under the laser, try this Wrecking Balm Tatoo Removal and Fade kit!  It really works and even quicker than all those trips costly trips for laser removal specialist.  I know as I was able to talk my son into trying this and he is happy about how well it works!  Believe me, we are grateful for this product and all the money it saves us and the time spent on laser removal.  Wish I had known about this earlier but, we are happy we found it, now!!  It really works better than laser removal!!</li>
    <li> Poor product. Does not work. Tried using it on a small old tattoo, looked like it was effective at first, but after repeated use (as directed) it healed and was not much different then when I first started.</li>
    <li> I am on my 4th use of Wrecking Balm, And I already see my tattoo fading. I reccomend if you have a bigger tattoo work in sections the size of your palm.</li>
    <li> As a ratio removal product, this gets an F. However as a &amp;#34;personal massage&amp;#34; system I rate it a high B low A. Just please for the love of God, remove the unit that holds the abrasive pad first.  To sum it up, if a lady has to knock one off and your Wrecking Balm system is within reach, it&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable alternative to your rabbit stashed in your closet.</li>
