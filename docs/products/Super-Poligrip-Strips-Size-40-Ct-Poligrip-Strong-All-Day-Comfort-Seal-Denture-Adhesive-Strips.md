### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best stuff ever,wished my Walmart carried it again</li>
      <li>Works great, been using it for years!  </li>
      <li>their price was great and delivery was very quick!!!!</li>
      <li>great product; swiftly delivered.</li>
      <li>good price for a good product</li>
      <li>Although these were not for me, my brother says that they are the best item available to keep your dentures in place.  </li>
      <li>I love the product, it keeps food out and works well</li>
      <li>there&#x27;s nothing &amp;#34;oozing&amp;#34; out like there would be with denture adhesive creams, so I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d do just as well, or better, buying Fixadent or Secure Denture Bonding cream (much better for the money).</li>
      <li>The product itself is excellent, the only one of this genre to adequately secure my mother&#x27;s dentures - her having a high roof/palate.</li>
      <li>Yes, my Super PoliGrip strips did meet my expectations.</li>
      <li>They came on time, and now I can smile again.</li>
      <li>Although a pity I had to spend more to have it posted from the US than its cost price, I was grateful to be able to access it.</li>
      <li>This seller sent the item right away</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t stick well and it feels funny in your mouth.</li>
      <li>but no one wants them!  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed these.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very please with the service.</li>
      <li>Better than expected.</li>
      <li>At first it seemed alright not messy</li>
      <li>These strips hold ok, but in my opinion they are not worth the money.</li>
      <li>I cut the strips and that a little better.</li>
      <li>While it is a bit tricky with the strips sticking to my fingers they kept my upper denture much flatter against the roof of my mouth than the denture cream.</li>
      <li>I will certainly be buying them again and hope the UK-based stores will have them in stock back from prior relegation.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s kind of icky, but it&#x27;s simple to remove with a toothbrush, maybe finish it up with some Listerine just to make sure there isn&#x27;t anything left behind that you missed.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>It is a really cool product it last me 3 days paste or powder only last me a day and a half I would definitely recommend</li>

<li> but then after a few minutes in your mouth it feels like spit!</li>
<li> and they were no good at all, for me anyway.  </li>
<li> Seals stuck to my gums and was Difficult to remove.</li>

    <li> I had tried Sea Bond wafers which had no grip at all on my gums, so I gave Poligrip Strips a try. I placed the three strips according to package directions, put my dentures in and bit down as directed. I removed the strips that night and used the strips again this morning. While it is a bit tricky with the strips sticking to my fingers they kept my upper denture much flatter against the roof of my mouth than the denture cream. I am sold on these and will buy a larger quantity next time!</li>

    <li> For months we&#x27;d been stalking this elusive product in a variety of stores and from the Britain-based branch themselves. The product itself is excellent, the only one of this genre to adequately secure my mother&#x27;s dentures - her having a high roof/palate. Although a pity I had to spend more to have it posted from the US than its cost price, I was grateful to be able to access it. I will certainly be buying them again and hope the UK-based stores will have them in stock back from prior relegation.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work like the description said. Seals didn&#x27;t hold long enough. Seals stuck to my gums and was Difficult to remove.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t use dentures, but someone suggested these for applying fake buck teeth (more specifically, ones made from fake nails). They usually stay on pretty well, and if they do get loose, I just have to &amp;#34;re-lick&amp;#34; and put some pressure on the fake teeth. When taking them off, they do leave a sticky gunk (which would be the poligrip strip, obviously) and it&#x27;s kind of icky, but it&#x27;s simple to remove with a toothbrush, maybe finish it up with some Listerine just to make sure there isn&#x27;t anything left behind that you missed.&lt;br /&gt;But there&#x27;s nothing &amp;#34;oozing&amp;#34; out like there would be with denture adhesive creams, so I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
    <li> stil have that gum felling when your dentures out. I cut the strips and that a little better.</li>
    <li> good price for a good product</li>
    <li> great product; swiftly delivered.</li>
    <li> Dad doesn&#x27;t like these at all.  Tossed them in the trash.</li>
    <li> Yes, my Super PoliGrip strips did meet my expectations. They came on time, and now I can smile again. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I needed these.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to try these and they were no good at all, for me anyway.  They didn&#x27;t hold my lower denture in at all.  I will never use them again.  Shoot, I&#x27;m trying to give the rest of them away but no one wants them!  Not the seller&#x27;s fault.  This seller sent the item right away and I&#x27;m very please with the service.</li>
    <li> Works great, been using it for years!  their price was great and delivery was very quick!!!!</li>

    <li> At first it seemed alright not messy but then after a few minutes in your mouth it feels like spit! They don&#x27;t stick well and it feels funny in your mouth.I had to go back to my Denture Adhesive Cream.Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Same as drug store without the embarassment of buying. I love the product, it keeps food out and works well</li>
