<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m excited to learn all the benefits of this oil.  Love the scent!</li>
    <li> I really like this lavender essential oil.  I&#x27;m no expert on this, and I&#x27;ve only had lavender E O one other time a few years ago, but i find it to be a wonderful calming scent.. also, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Very nice oil...will order again!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it! I now walk into her house and it smells like Lavender Land!</li>
    <li> Helping with a skin rash! Mixing it with coconut oil and applying it to rash.</li>
    <li> Put some in my bath and it was a little much, but I like adding a few drops to olive oil and putting it on my neck. Helps relaxing a lot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to be used with shea butter in making my own lotion.  A few drops is all I need to get a mild, unobtrusive fragrance.  I have considered using it around the house, but so far I&#x27;ve kept it for personal use.  A little goes a long way, so this little bottle is expected to last a while.</li>
    <li> Fast Transaction, item received as described.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it in the diffuser of the same company and the smell may be very mild if to add 3 drops or a bit stronger if add 5 drops. It smells so good and natural! If you don&#x27;t have a diffuser, it&#x27;s very good to drop a bit on the pillow for a better sleep and well-being.</li>
    <li> nice for concoction and general aromatherapy in kids&#x27; rooms</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Really good and condensed scent. I&#x27;ll be buying it in the future whenever I get low.</li>
    <li> It did not smell like any lavender I remember.  I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Love that I can get a big bottle.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and lovely product.  I use a few drops in my closet (applied to the wood), and it deters moths.  Plus I love the smell of lavender.</li>
    <li> This has an odd smell unlike most lavender I&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
    <li> The sent doesn&#x27;t linger. I have been using it in a humidifier but the scent is gone quickly. After reading the other reviews I was hopeful</li>
    <li> I was having problems with my acne and the redness it caused. My friend recommended I try essential oils since they&#x27;re natural and don&#x27;t irritate like my chemical products. This lavender has made more of a difference on my face than any prescription so far. It&#x27;s great, I&#x27;m really relieved with it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for scent that is pleasant, but not sickly sweet, this is a nice choice.</li>
    <li> Smells just like lavender.  I will be using it in my hair butter and my oil and water spritz  for my hair.</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic; it is the perfect potency and smells amazing! It arrived quickly, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the customer service of My Green Origin. I definitely will be buying more from them in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased with the Lavender Essential Oil, and with the many suggestions for use that have been forward to me after the sale.  Thank you for a quality product and quality service.</li>
    <li> Helpful in calming my twins before naps &amp; bedtime. I&#x27;ve bought several bottles already.</li>
    <li> I am finally able to sleep at nights!  I have had other TRUE (or supposedly) lavender essential oils, but NONE have ever worked like this one!  The smell is also SO HEAVENLY!  I will not purchase lavender essential oil from anyone but this seller from now on!</li>
    <li> This was a gift I sent to my daughter so I wasn&#x27;t there when it was opened, but I could smell the heavenly scent of lavender when I put my nose to the cap of the bottle before wrapping it.  The scent was wonderful.  Next time I will be getting some for myself!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item to give to a family member as she suffers from migraines.  Good friend of mine swears that lavender oil helps with migraines.  Well might be working....not sure if the go away by itself or from the lavender oil.  What&#x27;s best about this company is that they email you with different uses for the lavender oil.  Awesome that they do this.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time in great condition and product met expectations, would recommend to friends. Love it in bath water and foot soak.</li>
    <li> I use lavender oil to relax and rest at night. Every night I rub a few drops on my pulse points and on my neck just before bedtime. This is my first time using this brand and find it superior to the rest. After reading the comments of other, I plan to make use of it in other ways.</li>
    <li> This is my first lavender oil,  cannot compare to another brand but I&#x27;m happy with the purchase!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> The product is great, as are the email tips they send with tips and ideas for use.  Would like to have the uses and benefits printed on the bottle in larger print maybe on an insert.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product....This oil is what all oils should be like...I opened the bottle and felt like I was walking through a fresh field of lavenders. Satisfaction is an understatement. I will definetly be purchasing again....</li>
    <li> I had a burn from boiling water and used this lightly around the edges to help heal and also help with the scar.  Very pleased with the results.  Smells wonderful!  I am wondering if anyone could tell me what % I should use to diffuse in the air for allergies?  We are suffering a bit with them in the Midwest right now and I saw that lavender is supposed to help?</li>
    <li> This is my first time using essential oils--the packaging was very good.  The aroma was good.  I really appreciate the emails and the tips on how to use the lavender oil, it was very helpful.</li>
    <li> I have a few other essential oils but have not used lavender before. The day it arrived, I happened to go for a run wearing a top that chafed under my arms. Remembering that lavender oil was good for burns and skin irritation, I rubbed a drop on the chafed areas before getting in the shower, hoping to avoid the pain when water hits it. It worked. I&#x27;m looking forward to using it in lotions and oil.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly, it is as described and it smells very good. It&#x27;d be nice to see some more information regarding the lavenders source, who is the producer, information on it&#x27;s chemical make up etc as I&#x27;m interested in essential oils for health reasons not just a pretty smell.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased young living oil from my friend to see what all the hype was about, it was nice but I can&#x27;t afford to spend $30 plus on lavender oil.  I was happy to receive this bottle because it was bigger than expected because I use lavender for everything around my house.  I put in my oil diffuser, in the kids baths, on my mattresses before I put on clean sheet and on cuts or scrapes. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Use it with oil infused calendula and a variety of oils (E, Almond, and a splash of grapeseed) with organic shea butter, organic beeswax, and a little emulsifier, and we have an amazingly therapeutic lotion the whole family reaches for!</li>
    <li> This is the best on the market for Lavender Oil.  My only problem is the dark lavender color label with very small black printing is very hard to read.  Otherwise, I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this scent as well as I&#x27;ve liked others.  I won&#x27;t get again but this is a personal preference issue</li>
    <li> I love Lavender essential oil and am using few different brands.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this brand oils first time and this is one of very hight quality lavender essential oil and I am glad that I got it.</li>
    <li> One of the best oils I have used!!! amazing quality, long lasting. Just by the presentation of the product I new that I was getting an amazing product. The smell is incredible!!!! I am very happy with my purchase! thank you Lavander Population!!!!</li>
    <li> I am using it in a lighted diffuser, which heats up the oil, which seems to lessen the effect of this oil.  After doing much research, found out it should be used in a mist diffuser with no heat.  I have ordered a mist diffuser and will use it in that and see if the scent lasts longer.  This oil is one of the better rated oils and I will order it again if the scent is better with the mist diffuser.  Using it with a light heated diffuser requires using more drops daily and the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long at all.  In summary, I think this is a good oil and will do better in the right diffuser.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product! Pure and undiluted, it&#x27;s exactly as described by seller.</li>
    <li> The more I use it the more I love it and the more I find even more uses for this wonderful oil.</li>
    <li> The quality of the oil is great!! The smell is wonderful and provides stress relief instantly ! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT - great price and smells WONDERFUL!!!  The company even e-mailed me with some very helpful ways to use this product that I hadn&#x27;t even thought of!  Thank you! I will re-order!</li>
    <li> This is great lavender, very relaxing! I use it in a blend of mandarin, lavender and sweet marjoram essential oils dilluted with fractionated coconut as a sleepy time scent.</li>
    <li> I love your brand of Lavender oil!  The potency  is what I especially like!  I will use your products in the future!  Chaio!</li>
    <li> This was delivered on time.  It is a essential at my home.  I use lavender essential oil for most of my own creams and soaps.  This lavender oil has a wonderful full body scent.  I love that you are sent ways to use this essential oil for pain relief, cramps, acne in an email.  This has made buying on line easier and gives information at the same time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used young living and other brands of oils in the past and was hoping this was comparable . Again I was disappointed in the quality and doesn&#x27;t compare to young living brand.  Bummed because I wanted to save money.</li>
    <li> Simply LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this Lavender Oil!  Thanks so much!  Dixie</li>
    <li> I read other peoples reviews and purchased this product to use on my face and skin.  It is wonderful and I would recommend!</li>
    <li> My wife uses Essential Oils to avoid the chemicals in cleaning supplies. She uses a lot! The 1 once bottle of lavender is definitely a plus for us. My wife tested this oil and she was happy with the quality. I personally enjoy the calming scent around the house.</li>
    <li> This oil smells great.  I like to heat a little in a diffuser just before I go to bed to make my room smell nice and help me relax.  It only takes a couple minutes for the aroma to fill the room and only a few drops to provide the fragrance.  It smells natural, too, not artificial like some oils.  I&#x27;m sure I will find other uses for it as well.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of lavender.  I am using it in a diffuser in our car and it puts out a mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> The purest and best quality oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great quality essential oil.</li>
    <li> This is the best price for 100% essential oil and their customer service is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Fantastic oil! Only a few drops in my water and the entire room smells amazing! Also, as aesthetician I use the drops in water for my towels and my clients love the scent. Very little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve ordered this product many times and I will continue to!</li>
    <li> Excellent scent! Use in a diffuser for sleep, in your bath water or in an average sized room for light aromatherapy. Not overwhelming at all.</li>
    <li> It is everything I expected.  It is truly an essential oil.  The scent is so lavender and so enticing.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I chose it because it is a very pure 100% therapeutic essential oil.  I found it to have a very nice fragrance.  I use it in bath salts as well as many other DIY body products.  I recently used it undiluted for ant bites and it gave immediate relief.  I also used it to help heal a small cut and I was surprised at how quickly it healed.  The company provided an email with tips for use of the product, which I found helpful.  I will purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> It smells heavenly! Just the right scent that is sooooo relaxing. Shipping was quick and the bottle was packed securely. You won&#x27;t be sorry you chose this lavendar essential oil!</li>
    <li> This lavender essential oil has the purest scent of lavender. I have used it in my baths when I want to relax. The scent is so wonderful and healing and relaxes me. There are so many other healing uses for this lavender oil. This is the lavender oil that I will continue to use and I recommend it to anyone who can&#x27;t decide which one to buy. Buy Lavender Population by My Green Origin.</li>
    <li> So far I am only using these on my wool dryer balls, I add a few drops every 4-5 loads of laundry. I do really enjoy it.;</li>
    <li> I love this oil and I am using it in my home everyday  Very pleasant and calming effect</li>
    <li> I love this lavender oil!!!  I use a few drops of this product with a few other ingredients in my bath water.  This is such an inexpensive way to relax after a long day.  The aroma of the lavender calms my anxiety and helps me get a restful night sleep.</li>
    <li> Received the product on time and property wrapped.  I put 5 drops of oil in my bathtub and feels good after bath.  I also used a few drops and massage the oil on my temple and helps me feel relaxed.  I still have to use it though when drying my clothes.  I will recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> They were fantastic!  Everything was as advertised and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this wonderful product!! I use tiny bits it this time of year mixed with almond oil to ease my dry eyes.  I also put drops of it in my dog&#x27;s bath to help ward off his summer fleas.&lt;br /&gt;Service was prompt as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>

    <li> Best Lavender I ever bought! The smell is a little sweet at times, a little herb smell, and very nice. I have different lavenders from different companies and this is the best. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Really nice essential oil that works like magic to make a bath into a relaxing spa treatment! Love this scent!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil.  I use it in a diffuser in my bedroom every evening and even keep a bottle in my purse in case I need a quick &amp;#34;relaxer&amp;#34;.  Just a tiny drop on my wrist calms me right down.</li>
    <li> Love it.  The fragrance is soothing to my sole.  I put a drop on the edge of my pillow case at night and it calms me to sleep.  A drop in the air vent of my car also makes the car smell sooooo good and lasts for days at a time.</li>
    <li> I have trouble sleeping at night and rubbing a couple of drops on my temples relax me and the scent calms me down.  It is undiluted so the scent is strong, a drop goes a long way.  Would definitely purchase from My Green Origin again.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with the seller, the transaction, and the quality of the product. It does have many uses, but so far I have only used in the making of my own pre shave lotion. Good product, excellent seller.</li>
    <li> Mmm… Pure Lavender! I love it!</li>
    <li> love the smell and relaxing effect received from this product.  I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of lavender oil while visiting France last year.  After I finished it, I started looking for a similar product and this product was it!  The smell is great and the oil is concentrated as I only need a little bit of the product.  I will definitely buy more of this oil.  The presentation was good and delivery on time.</li>
    <li> We are sold on Lavandula Angustifolia and are very pleased with your product.  We will order more when we&#x27;re through with this one!</li>
    <li> We love your product and love lavender essential oils. Thank you for your tips as to how to use your product. The label is also lovely. Jaime...</li>
    <li> very high quality lavender oil.  really aromatic!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a Lavender Oil which is 100% pure, there are many out there mixed with other oils, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this one, it isn&#x27;t cheap but that&#x27;s because it is undiluted.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product.  I even received an email from MyGreenOrigin suggesting uses for lavender oil I never knew existed.</li>
    <li> Good service and the oil seems wonderful.</li>
    <li> my wife is a fan of all essential oils. I personally prefer lavender because of the pleasant of the smell. i bought this for my wife since i saw it advertised and she is happy with it. she says the quality of the oil is very good and we are both enjoying the wonderful and relaxing smell. it was a good purchase , a lot cheaper that other quality oils i have bought before.</li>
    <li> Lavender oil is something I always used for sleeping/relaxation purposes. In Peru it is used a lot especially in the mountains due to its helpful effects.&lt;br /&gt;I have been shopping around for one that really FEELS like a natural remedy. Finally I found a product that feels like the natural oil and is really effective. School and work can be very stressful so I put some in my purse, shower, and bed. Like a breeze of freshness and alleviating factors combined. Will need to buy more!</li>
    <li> I use this brand for diffusing, since I tend to run my diffuser everyday and this is a bigger bottle than the standard 5ml sizes that are sold elsewhere.  I believe their bottle is 30 ml in size.  The reason I gave it five stars is because I like the informational followup messages sent be J&amp;M/MyGreen Origin on how to use Lavender.  I keep forgetting about the many uses, so their emails are nice reminders.</li>
    <li> Excellent, smells lovely.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time &amp; as expected. Love this lavender essential oil! It&#x27;s not weak like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This particular variety of lavender smells super-deluxe, &amp; it&#x27;s not mixed with cheaper oils. I love it in the bath- it&#x27;s great for skin, for calming (unless a LOT is used- then it&#x27;s stimulating). Think I&#x27;ll use it on some natural drier sheets too, to freshen laundry &amp; linens... It&#x27;s therapeutic AND smells good!&lt;br /&gt;I typically get the best oils from Nature&#x27;s Gift (not found on Amazon). When I&#x27;ve tried a comparable brand on Amazon, it can be disappointing. But this oil&#x27;s an exception- seems to be really good quality.</li>
    <li> I am an essential oils convert and this lavender oil has been amazing!! I use it for everything from laundry, diffusing, rubbing on temples to sleep better, and even for rashes and cuts/scrapes! It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality lavender oil... The scent is AMMAAZZING!!! I received my first bottle as a gift... What an awesome gift!!! I&#x27;ve purchased two more bottles since. I forgot what true lavender is supposed to smell like, until I tried this brand. I&#x27;ve tried cheaper brands, but they smell terrible compared to this one. I LOVE this oil and would highly recommend it to anyone!!! The true lavender scent is unbelievably calming and relaxing!</li>
    <li> Very good oil at a very reasonable price</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is extremely pleasant.  It&#x27;s highly fragrant, in a subtle and deep way; I&#x27;m not an expert on describing aromas, but an adjective that seems right to me is &amp;#34;round.&amp;#34;  Not at all overpowering, as essential oils can sometimes be.  I&#x27;m in love with this product, and will order it again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this with my humidifier, and I like to add it to relaxing baths.</li>
    <li> I have used other more expensive oils for many years and always knew that lavender was on of the must haves.&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out of my other brand I decided to try this one and am thrilled with it!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is superior and the cost is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Lavender oil should be everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma, good costomer service. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> wonderful fragrance, well packaged and I have already used it in many ways</li>
    <li> The lavendar oil is wonderful! It smells like real lavendars and takes just a few drops in my Muji to infuse my entire bedroom with gorgeous, restful lavender.  I will purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is also great! Quick service and good packaging.</li>
    <li> Got my Lavender oil and love it Thanks so much for fast service!</li>
    <li> Love the scent for yoga scent bags, as well as home use. My family really loved the scent very relaxing. Thank you</li>
    <li> The quality of this My Green Origin product seems very comparable to a much better known brand that I&#x27;ve been using. As far as I can tell, the only difference with this oil is that there&#x27;s a lot more of it for a lot less money. Well packaged with super fast delivery too. I put a few drops on my pillow for a relaxing night of sleep. I&#x27;ll be trying some of their other products in the near future.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan. The smell is a little artificial for my taste.</li>
    <li> I have been putting this on the soles of my feet at bedtime and sleeping incredibly well.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Very professional and great protective packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been happy with all of my Amazon purchases thus far, until I purchased this to replace the Unilution Lavender Oil that came with my EcoGecko air revitalizer.  Please avoid this oil at all costs, as it wreaks of solvent and smells nothing like lavender.  I almost couldn&#x27;t tolerate to be in the room with the stench.  I cannot speak to the validity of these comments with regards to their (the seller offering this oil) other scents, but the Unilution oil provided with the air revitalizer I&#x27;d originally purchased is exponentially better than this product.  I would not recommend this to anyone, and for the price it is an absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great lavender scent. I have used it neat (undiluted) on my temples with peppermint oil for a migraine and it cleared the symptoms within 5 minutes. Great product!</li>
    <li> Your product is fabulous; thank you.</li>
    <li> Thank you for quality product!</li>
    <li> Very nice lavender oil. First time using this company and am pleased with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Very good quality lavender oil.  I&#x27;ve already ordered my second bottle!</li>
    <li> Sure relaxes me at night so I get a goodnights sleep.</li>
    <li> smells great! thanks!</li>
    <li> This lavender oil does what I bought it to do. I have a lingering leg issue caused by a break and subsequent infection. Application of this oil reduced pain almost immediately and also served to bring down the swelling some. I have used several brands of oil and not all are especially effective. I&#x27;m happy to say, this one is.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Very intense, smells wonderful. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing company. I love the lavender essential oil I ordered from them.  They also accompany the oil with a pamphlet regarding all the things you can use the oil for as well as fyi follow up emails.  Very happy with this product &amp; will deffinetly order this product as well as other essential oils from them.</li>
    <li> Excellent, high quality product.  I especially appreciated the tips provided by My Green Origin. I originally purchased to use to repel pesky flies in the house (with the pleasant aroma of lavender) -  but have found several other uses, including dabbing the oil on a cotton ball to toss into the dryer.</li>
    <li> This oil is not 100% pure lavender oil. If it says &#x27;do not ingest&#x27; on the label then it is not pure. Not satisfied.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like the lavender plants in my garden and was not the lasting scent I was hoping for. For aromatherapy uses, it is a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, exhilarating essential oil.  I put drops into my bath water.  I mix it with leave-in condition.  I totally love it.</li>
    <li> This essential is as advertised.</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful!  Love the quality and the many uses for the product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil that the whole family uses...in the bath, on bug bites, etc. fast shipment, a great company to buy from.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of lavender....</li>
    <li> Good quality Lavender oil. Hard to find oil this good domestically. Had to import from Canada &amp; Europe prior to this purchase to get this quality (at a MUCH higher price).</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending an additional bottle of Lavender Population. I also appreciated the shared uses. I believe it will repel Mosquitos if you rub some of the lavender oil on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;Sandy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and I&#x27;m so glad I found My Green Origin.  The quality of their oil is amazing and exactly what I was expecting.  I transferred the oil into an amber dropper bottle for easier use.  Love this oil!</li>
    <li> Fragrant! And very good customer service</li>
    <li> Very effective! Unlike cheaper lavenders this lavender is the right type for calming down. There are other lavenders out there but they are a different kind and can actually be a stimulant! Stick with this one it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Great service and fantastic tips!</li>
    <li> My Green Origin Lavender population oil is my favorite Lavender oil, the healthful properties are far superior to many others I have tried. The aroma is lovely, soothing and floral with a calming effect.  The shipping was very fast!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend My Green Origin.</li>
    <li> Wondrous product!&lt;br /&gt;Great price and perfect for beginners investigating the benefits of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, teach the recipient/s of essential oils the importance of dilution and sensitivity testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased and sent to &#x27;needy&#x27; folks for blending with Organic Tea Tree Oil for use in an acne treatment blend.&lt;br /&gt;However, learned that the household&#x27;s  HOT YOGA person LOVES this Lavender and adds a few drops to water as a spritz for her yoga mat cover-nearly daily!  She often alternates with an organic peppermint essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Compares very well to the commercial size Lavender Population I purchase for skin care lotions as  to fragrance appeal, and effectiveness for dampening itchiness of insect bites..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again for gifts...as it is a perfect travel sized &amp;#34;ESSENTIAL.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Good quality essential oil that I received as gift. I use lavender  oil in all of my home made house hold and beauty products and this larger bottle has gone a long way</li>
    <li> This product was amazing. The sent was truly lavender. This is something I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the lavender essential oil, it smells wonderful, warm and cozy!</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE IT</li>
    <li> 100% pure lavender essential oil with delightfully scent</li>
    <li> I have been using your lavender essential oil since it came and I love it. Rich scent and very soothing. I&#x27;d use this again. Pleased beyond my expectations since this was my first try. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I like this product, I will reorder</li>
    <li> Excellent price, arrived quickly with no breakage (that&#x27;s happened to me with other vendors).  The sales/support folks are great - they are very interested in answering any questions you have. I even received an email describing holistic, healthy uses for lavender oil of which I was unaware.</li>
    <li> Smells great and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Better than other essential oils  I have tried for aromatherapy! excellent quality!  Good price!&lt;br /&gt; I will buy again</li>
    <li> Am I missing something?  I just received the lavendar in the mail and the smell was not very pleasant.  I expected it to smell like the lavendar plant that I had growing in my yard but it was nothing like that. I&#x27;m new to essential oils so maybe I&#x27;m wrong in assuming it should.  Any comments would be helpful.</li>
    <li> Love my oils! Great product &amp; very therapudic! Love how the company truly cares about my satisfaction! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful oil...true essential oil...not a knock off.  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Not as nice as young living</li>
    <li> lovely fragrance used  in diffuser</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t what product some of the other reviewer received, but this stuff smells awful. I bought it because of the reviews and have to say it is the worst smelling lavender oil I have ever used. Very strong chemical smell. It is so strong I can&#x27;t really even smell the lavender. I won&#x27;t continue to use this.</li>
    <li> the oil is the right consistency and smell but the reducer is too lax - the drops come out too fast for me to count&lt;br /&gt;worked well as mosquito repellant alongside peppermint and thyme (as well as a remedy for mosquito bites by itself - neat)</li>
    <li> This is top quality, high grade lavender oil. It&#x27;s very potent and you only need to use a very small amount</li>
    <li> Good product, I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of this product.</li>
    <li> I question the purity of this oil.  I love using Young Living oils, but thought I&#x27;d give this a try for the great price.  I haven&#x27;t used this, but did open it to compare the scent to my YL lavender, and there is quite a difference.  This oil seems to have an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; smell, and although it claims to be 100% pure essential oil and the listing states it is therapeutic grade, the label states &amp;#34;Only For External Use.&amp;#34;  YL&#x27;s lavender oil can be used as a dietary supplement, or for topical and aromatic use.  Wish I could&#x27;ve given this a better review, but 2 stars will be all I can give it, due to the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love my peppermint oil.  Fast shipping and great packaging!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, we had an infestation of clothes moths. I had to throw away an article of clothing because it looked scatter-shot, it was so riddled with holes. My research indicated that they do not like lavender. I decided to make a linen spray of undiluted lavender oil and vodka to spritz on all of our clothes. Can&#x27;t say for sure that it worked but my husband likes the smell! I saw a few moths afterward, in the window and the kitchen, but none in the closet. I think, at least I hope, it did the trick. Apparently, cedar works too.  I am considering also applying cedar oil to cotton balls and leaving them in little cups throughout the closet or some other application. Some people like the smell of cedar on their clothes but I think I will stick with the lavender for my clothes and cedar for the closet.</li>
    <li> this is the best, economical lavender oil I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The additional information on the uses of the oil was very helpful. The package arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great service.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Use it every night. I like it for skin blemishes and such.</li>
    <li> Already arrived, smells great! Can&#x27;t wait to use it...</li>
    <li> Nice oil. Use it in aromatherapy. Good customer service, too. Only complaint is that Dropper should have smaller diameter, as drops come out fairly fast. This is my first purchase of lavender, so have no way to compare it to other oils.</li>
    <li> I use lavender oil on cloth and put it in my dryer to scent the items in the dryer.  I also use it in the fabric softener dispenser for the same purpose.  We noticed that our precious kitty (nearly 24 years old) was attracted to lavender diffusers, started putting drops on the edge of the blankets he liked to sleep on.  Since he seems to really like it, and at his age we want him to be as comfortable and happy as he can be.  Found this oil on Amazon, have bought two orders of six bottles from My Green Origin.  Have been very happy with it.  The fragrance is good / strong, so a few drops go a long way.  My Green Origin does not over-use packaging (very important to me) however, each bottle is carefully wrapped in bubble wrap and each order has been delivered on time and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I only use lavender oil or any essential oil on my kitty&#x27;s bedding, never directly on him and certainly not internally.  This oil works for my purposes.  Essential oils are pure and can be used medicinally and internally but I do not have the training.  If you wish to use essential oils directly on skin or in cooking or internally, be very careful to get advise from a trained aroma therapist or at the very least educate yourself with one or more of the many Aromatherapy books available or call My Green Origin for their advise.  My veterinarian has cautioned me (unnecessarily) not to put oils directly on cat, especially, but any of my creatures if I don&#x27;t know what I am doing.  There can be interaction with other medications / herbs, or cats and dogs will lick oils off their feet (an area often recommended for applying essential oils).  Essential oils can be serious medicine and very effective and should be treated as such.</li>
    <li> Great scent for a great price!</li>
    <li> It is a lovely oil and was delivered lickety split!  Am anxious to use it in several different ways, specifically in my dryer to make my linens smell wonderful.  It&#x27;s also nice to use a very small dab if a blemish outbreak occurs or when sleep seems to elude me all I do is put the tiniest bit right under my nose.  It does help relax one into sleep.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s workable essential oil, and it makes for nice scented heat pads.  Also, I appreciated that it was carefully packaged and delivered safely.</li>
    <li> This was as good as any other brand I have tried!</li>
    <li> great stuff :) it feels more natural then others i&#x27;ve tried. i use it for everything, especially excema.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  The fragrance is divine.  So many uses for Lavender oil, but I especially love putting it in my bath water.  Completely relaxing.  I will be ordering more from this company.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and its many uses! I have started using few drops in the bath with bath salts...so relaxing and wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Big bottle for the price, and very potent! Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality lavender oil. It is keeping its integrity very well with time--by that, I mean, it&#x27;s not turning bad--I have had that experience with other lavender oils.</li>
    <li> This oil is good quality. I love the aroma!!!  It is sweet and very lasting. I use Lavender for everything, I just love the calming scent of Lavender. This oil exceeded my expectations, I already made my linen spray and used it in a foot bath. The size of the bottle is very convenient too. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product. You can tell the difference in first use.&lt;br /&gt; I will definitely purchase this product again. Thank you again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this Lavender.... I use it in the bath and for making lavender water to soak areas where my pets have small injuries.  It completely healed up a bad scrape on my cats foot.  I also use a drop on each temple to alleviate headaches or stress and I love placing a few drops on my pillow at night .... very soothing to fall asleep with the scent of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;This company is very helpful and the product is as described.  Thank you My Green Origin!</li>
    <li> I love this!  It was delivered quickly and well packaged.  I diluted a few drops with water and sprayed on my pillow, towels and couch pillows. Next is to put in the bath with epsom salts and baking soda.</li>
    <li> Received !this very quickly. Packaged well. Smells fabulous! Can&#x27;t wait to use this! Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mother.  She seems to be very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love lavender oil and all its uses.  Your version is very pure!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and as described</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the scent and quality. I usually use Young Living products, and was not sure what to expect with this. I was pleasantly surprised. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Lavender essential oil.  I use it nightly in my diffuser and get a wonderful nights sleep.  Will definately buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent quality oil. It smells fantastic and pure, very fresh. Lavender is one of those oils that is good for everything from calming a skin rash or sunburn to helping soothe the nerves. Although this is a bit more expensive than some I have bought, you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I had try many oils before and so far this one it&#x27;s the best. My 2 Sons love it as well</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the fast delivery and the quality of this product.  The smell is subtle, the way I like it.  I use it mainly for laundry.  I place a few drops on the dryer balls (100% wool dryer balls) during the last 10 minutes of the drying cycle.  It gives sheets and towels a lovely smell.  I plan to purchase more for gifts and my own use in the near future.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I add it to my kids humidifier  and it helps them relax and breathe better especially when they are congested.</li>
    <li> wonderful stuff!  Works good for headaches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive oils but find this is a quality product for the right price. I will buy this one again.</li>
    <li> happy with product and happy with price!!! smell is fresh and I use it on my babys skin to give her massages... mixed with almond oil...</li>
    <li> Great product. It smells so good. And the company follows through with tips on what to do with the oil... I found that very helpful.</li>
    <li> This is particularly pure and good lavender oil.  I have purchased many and find this one of the very best.  I use it daily for different reasons.  There are so many good thing that can be done with lavender oil.  Put on an insect bite, clean a cut, it has so many uses.</li>
    <li> The product is very good. Awesome customer service. Will be buying more. The lavender scent is the best I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because is it pure lavender oil and because compared to other products it was priced just right.  I use this for my dog to calm her when I need to trim her nails or when she seems nervous - works really well.  I use I myself as well in a foot bath.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> This is the best lavender I have ever bought. Fresh and fragrant, high quality. Fast shipping too!!!!! I highly recommend this for your herbal therapy and medicine making.</li>
    <li> Love it! Use it every night on my pollow! Helps me to relax into a good might&#x27;s sleep. Good Night:)</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected. Works beautifully to add fragrance to detergent. Also plan using to scent other projects. Great smell. Thanks My Green Origin.</li>
    <li> Very potent essential oil. Great shipping.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations, love it. thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very acceptable fragrance. There are some fragrances that bother me causing me to cough however this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I am very picky when choosing a lavender oil, the scent differs in the different brands because of how it is processed and where is from and what type the lavender is and there are some brand&#x27;s scent that I can&#x27;t stand.  This particular brand of Lavender, Population Essential Oil from My Green Origin Amazon Marketplace smells wonderful.  I have put it on a paper towel and left it under the seat in my car, put a drop on my pillow, and also used it for healing purposes. I will definitely buy this brand in the future and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Lovely product. Will reorder</li>
    <li> I love using essential oils. Based on the reviews of this product, and the product description, I had higher expectations. The smell is awful. Hard to explain, maybe similar to alcohol smell or artificial smell. Granted, they say made from organic lavender, but perhaps they use a chemical in the process of extraction???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was a bad batch, or old. I&#x27;d like to believe that this bottle was an exception to an otherwise great product. I have not tried other products from Green Origin, but based on this, I cannot recommend the company nor this lavender oil. I was hoping for a more affordable company to try, but am disappointed. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I absolutely swear by 100% therapeutic grade lavender oil.  It has literally been a lifesaver for me.  I suffer from migraines, and a drop rubbed on each temple gives relief.  Also, it is an antispasmodic, and when I feel my spastic colon starting to act up, I rub some lavender oil on my abdomen, and I don&#x27;t go into a full spasmodic attack, but sometimes it can take as long as 20-30 min. for it to completely take effect.  As with the other symptoms caused by spastic colon, such as the gas, it takes care of that too.  And, I can also personally vouch for the fact that it helps with the itch and discomfort associated with eczema.  As far as I know, this is the only essential oil that can be rubbed directly on the skin, provided  you have no allergy to it.  I never go anywhere without a small bottle in my purse.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it on mosquito bites, either--takes care of the itch quickly.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  I started using the wool dryer balls in lieu of dryer sheets and I bought this to sprinkle on to the balls to give my laundry a nice fragrance.  It works beautifully.  I will never, ever go back to fabric softeners (liquid or dryer sheets).  This oil and the wool balls makes my laundry the softest and most pleasant smelling it&#x27;s ever been.  The oil does not an overpowering scent on the clothes.  It&#x27;s a soft, fragrant smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this to add to a whipped coconut oil body cream I make. It has floral notes rather than the herbal, woody notes of inferior Lavender</li>
    <li> After multiply bottles of different brands and not 100% pure (that is the key) this is a winner. I am pleased with this product! My son has sleep issues due to medication and this works like a charm. My husband uses it also. Will be purchasing more. So many other brands are diluted with other oils. Very important to read the label. Also how it is extracted and processed is important so you get the full oil and the benefits. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I love it! Saved my skin last night. Literally! After spilling a hot cup of tea in my lap, I slathered on some lavender oil and then some coconut oil on top of it, and within 5 minutes, the sting was gone. Today, it&#x27;s like i never burned myself.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I am currently studying for the bar exam and use this every night and it relaxes me. It is better than any of the other lavender oils I have used!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST ESSENTIAL OIL I HAVE EVER USED. The smell is strong, but it is very powerful and you can tell that this is REAL, pure essential oil. Use it with rubbing alcohol for linen spray, mix it with cream to heal burns and chapped lips, put it in a humidifier to make your room smell fresh - the list goes on and on. BUY THIS! You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> This lavender essential oil is high quality and has so many uses.  I put some into a roll-on bottle to apply it directly onto my mosquito bites and acne to heal them quickly.  A few drops onto a cotton pad and tucked into my pillowcase really helps me to relax and sleep well at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed reading the emails sent by this company on the different uses of this oil, and appreciate the good customer service.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have migraines/occipital nerve neuralgia in my head..wiffs of your Lavender oil, peppermint and Frankincense really help me through some tough times that I have had lately......funny,  I get so sick when I smell perfumes, etc..but never get sick on pure essential oils...TRY THEM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol P.</li>
    <li> A bit medicinal smelling at first but after a few minutes,  the aroma is just heavenly! I love this oil and will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this in everything which reminds me I need to reorder. I sprinkle this around the bedroom for a nice relaxing scent. I dilute this with water from time to time to just give a light scent in the air.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling lavender! Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just recieve this product and i am higly disappointed. This product isn&#x27;t 100% natural. I should paid attention to the comments i read about the quality. Now i tested and i saw it is been mix with with others product. I never will recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly!  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far. The seller sent some ideas for use that I&#x27;m anxious to try. It&#x27;s the perfect scent of lavender.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it really helps you sleep. Use it in your bedroom or any other places you need a good fragrance.</li>
    <li> Delightful and fresh!</li>
    <li> Bought this on based on very positive reviews. What a disappointment!  Lavender scent is very weak,overwhelmed by some kind of different scent  Besides lasts only for short while. One I bought before was much better.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, excellent customer service, and best of all....  a slow healing surgical site has improved significantly in the past week, like an &amp;#34;oh my GOODness&amp;#34; sort of improvement. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great EO.  Will order again as needed.</li>
    <li> I have only had this lavender EO for a few weeks and have already fallen in love with it! I have added a few drops to my bath water for a relaxing, aromatic soak. I have also put a few drops in a quart of water and rinsed my hair with it. And, I have made a &amp;#34;sleepy time&amp;#34; balm by adding the lavender to shea butter and magnesium oil, whipping it and pouring it into tins. It is a lovely, true lavender scent that is very high quality. A little goes a long way. This bottle will easily last six months or more. I would purchase it again as someone who really appreciates the qualities of a good essential oil.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bottle for my daughter.  She loves the smell and said that it definitely helps to calm and relax her.  She is sleeping much better.  She rubs some on her feet before bedtime.  In the morning, she puts a few drops in the palm of her hand and inhales. She carries the bottle with her and uses it during the day if she feels her anxiety level rising.  Yes, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great smell and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend! Great quality Lavender oil. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Fragrance is very soothing, and used on pillows which resulted in more restful sleep</li>
