      <li>but I can&#x27;t wear it since it&#x27;s too light.</li>
      <li>Really light that it does not blend in with my hair at all.</li>
      <li>I bought for a quick ponytail</li>
      <li>Good price and still not worth the money.</li>
      <li>But It is a good hair piece, the clip is tight hasn&#x27;t broke or anything.</li>
      <li>So nice and you can wear it two different ways I like more fluff.</li>

<li> Not the length I expected</li>
<li> the clip is just to heavy and big</li>
<li> LIGHT BROWN. :(</li>
<li> It sheds a little and you can tell it was just thrown together on the clip.</li>
<li> NOT WORTH IT !  </li>
<li> Heavy!  </li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> Wrong color and took forever to get here</li>
<li> I just go the wrong color</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

    <li> Really light that it does not blend in with my hair at all. Disappointed. I bought for a quick ponytail but I can&#x27;t wear it since it&#x27;s too light. No where near the color in the picture. It sheds a little and you can tell it was just thrown together on the clip. It looks like a clip on. Good price and still not worth the money. Going back to hair stores for pony tail pieces.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great hair piece I just go the wrong color</li>
    <li> Heavy!  You&#x27;d better have pretty thick hair to clamp it to.  Nice looking, pretty color (I ordered light brown), but it is much more red than my natural hair and makes mine look very dull.</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH IT !  A SHORT DOLL HAIR&lt;br /&gt;NOT AS SHOWN AT ALL , COLOR TOO RED&lt;br /&gt;NOT LIGHT BROWN. :(</li>
    <li> Product as decribed ~ very happy &amp; plan on ordering another one very soon. Got light brown &amp; ordering a dark brown next :-)</li>
