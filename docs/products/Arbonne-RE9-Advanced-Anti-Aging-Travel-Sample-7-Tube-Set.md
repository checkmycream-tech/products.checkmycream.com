<li> Arbonne is a terrific product, but this is a sample that a consultant gets for $14 for a pack of 10, this is not good business.  </li>
<li> 9 bucks wasted</li>
<li> Seller you should be ashamed :/</li>
<li> I was disappointed in how small the trial tubes were.</li>

    <li> Very tiny samples....what company would charge for these.  I was shocked and I bought 3 to give to my sisters to try...they could not believe I paid for those...who knows if they are a good product...not enough to try for any time enough to see.</li>
    <li> yall are getting ripped off!  I give these away for FREE to clients who want to try.  Seller you should be ashamed :/</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE Arbonne!!!</li>
    <li> So misleading!  Granted I did not carefully examine to determine the fluid ounces of each product before ordering, but sheesh - these things are microscopically small!  I thought these would be great for traveling, but you can&#x27;t get more than one - MAYBE two uses out of these.  I have used the RE9 products before and they are great, but this travel set is useless in my book.</li>
