    <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR A LONG TIME! :D&lt;br /&gt;This works very good but can sting very badly. Use only on spots and not over large areas. It works well but like I said it can hurt until it dries so be careful when applying. Otherwise it does clear up a pimple wich them just flakes off. It does what it says! I like that!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think this product really works for me. It&#x27;s not too drying, which is good. It just doesn&#x27;t seem to clear up my existing acne.</li>
    <li> Size is VERY small but then so practical to travel with. Very efficient and doesn&#x27;t over dry the skin.</li>
    <li> I HAD 3 RED PIMPLES ON MY NECK AND CHEST AND 1 IS ALREADY CLEARED UP SO IM STILL WORKING ON THE OTHERS. I RECEIVED MINE ON THE 14TH WAY BEYOND DELIVERY SO YES IT WORKS BUT ITS REALLY PRICEY FOR THE SIZE WHICH WAS DISAPPOINTING BUT THAT&#x27;S JUST &amp;#34;CLINIQUE&amp;#34; FOR YA, PRICEY BUT WORKS FOR THE LONG HAUL.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after becoming increasingly frustrated with my skin, yet I wasn&#x27;t ready to make an appointment with a dermatologist. I hesitated because it is a bit pricey (especially for its size-I was almost shocked by how tiny it was when it arrived!) However, you really do not need to use a lot (a little goes quite far) and it works AMAZINGLY well! Within 1 month of applying the gel one time a day (at night) my skin was totally clear. I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Clinique has always been my go to product for my oily skin. This is a light clear gel that helps with break-outs and can be worn in the day time.Highly recommend all Clinique products for the young person to the more mature skin, have tried others but always go back to Clinique.</li>
    <li> Started using this with the total clinique acne solutions package. Already noticing a great difference.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help my acne. My face got redder and irritating</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This works really well</li>
    <li> Works perfectly at stopping breakouts.</li>
    <li> very good! It really works fro my skin. I love this set.</li>
    <li> Costs way too much for such a tiny amount of topical oinment, and a little bit does not go a long way, trust me. This product did absolutely nothing for my acne. May as well have put rubbing alcohol on my face. I am so upset that I bought this.</li>
    <li> This is the fastest working blemish gel I have been able to find (without a prescription). I also put in on my larger pore areas and they shrink overnight. With continued use you can experience flaking, but that means you are probably using too much, dial it back a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is hard to find, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been discontinued...</li>
