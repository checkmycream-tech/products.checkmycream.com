    <li> helps to keep nails from breaking,last long,and always looks nice.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed at all. I was told this would serve as a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; polish without actually getting gel nails - but it was terrible. It was easily smudged, and didn&#x27;t make nails last any longer than a normal manicure - 2-3 days max.  Disappointment.</li>
    <li> Makes tips look whiter and the rest of the nail look pinker, it&#x27;s super shiny, and keeps nails strong. It turns a darker pink color when your hands are cold. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.</li>
    <li> This product helped keep the nails from splitting and made nails stronger.  It prevents nails from splitting more.  My nails have grown longer than they ever have before.</li>
    <li> My niece got me this for Christmas..my nails have grown and are stronger, healthier looking..i could never get my nails to grow because they always chipped or broke off.,Not any more since i apply pink armour..awesome product..</li>
    <li> She says her nails grow faster and stronger, they don&#x27;t break as easily as before. The gel serves both as a base and top finish.&lt;br /&gt;She absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> The best product out there. I have never had nails til now !</li>
    <li> The product is working for me and I am very hands on with everything so if I can get some extra time on a manicure it is great&lt;br /&gt;especially when we are going out to dinner with friends during the week or just out with friends.</li>
    <li> This gel is great!! I have weak nails that peel and brake. I use this once every week and they are growing long and strong. Love it is all I can say. It also got here fast I think it was three days. I will order again from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love using Pink Armor, I didn&#x27;t think that it would work, but it does and I have nought two bottles so far...LOVE, LOVE, LOVE</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> Love this it really works!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that promised to help nails grow, but this one actually does it. I thought it was pricey, but for the results, it is worth the money. My nails are growing out so quickly, I actually have to trim them.  The polish makes my nails look very smooth and natural.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Only polish that makes my nails grow.</li>
    <li> The color is nice and it dries quickly, but it peels right off.</li>
    <li> I love it. My nails are so much better and they grow now instead of chipping and breaking.</li>
