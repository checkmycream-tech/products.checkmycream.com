    <li> Love this shower gel, really mild scent, and my husband likes it too!  Wish they would put it in a bottle with a pump, then I would like it even more!</li>

    <li> This product smells wonderful and is very gentle for my dry skin.I have used the Spring Green formula for many years.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells really good, my skin is softer and lathers well.  I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using body wash for the better part of 20 years now, and some work great, some not so much.  I tried Vitabath about 2 years ago and haven&#x27;t wandered off since.  The scents tend to be pleasant and don&#x27;t overpower my skin when I get out of the shower.  It lathers well and rinses clean.  I don&#x27;t feel any type of residue, and I&#x27;ve actually cut down on how much lotion I have to use (even in the winter).  The grapefruit vanilla scent is my favorite so far.  The vanilla isn&#x27;t overpowering (I like vanilla, mind you, but sometimes vanilla body washes are so overpowering that you can&#x27;t smell anything else).  The grapefruit combo makes it smell light, sweet, and as my s/o says &amp;#34;like a delicious confection.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair and somewhat sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with Vitabath.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Vitabath product and this one is no different.  I love the fact it does not have parabens or other added ingrediants to irritate my skin.  The scent is wonderful, understated yet nice.</li>
    <li> Love Vitabath Shower Gel, Grapefruit Vanilla!! One of my all time favorite!  Always look forward to using it! Leaves you smelling great with smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> I bought several different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Vitabath for a gift. I can&#x27;t rate as a user, just a giver and that seemed fine. But I recall not being overwhelmed by the fragrances I chose (which were maybe 5 total). I still give 4 stars, as it&#x27;s hard to find good bubble bath these days.</li>
    <li> Smells more vanilla than grapefruit.  Still has the quality one expects from Vitabath. It  cleanses without drying and moisturizes without feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Very nice body wash. A great scent without parabens or sulfates.</li>
    <li> I love Vita Bath products and this did not fail to please. I was wondering how grapefruit and vanilla would work and I love it. Vita Bath does a wonderful job of not being overbearing and still has the quality of making my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> My favorite shower gel. A very nice scent, nice thick lather, does not dry my skin.</li>
    <li> Smells way too perfume-y, much more so than the other scents I&#x27;ve bought by this brand (Green Tea and Beach Blossom). I suppose the bright pink packaging should have been a giveaway.</li>
    <li> I really like this shower gel, the only thing that would make it better if it was a creamy shower gel. My skin is super dry.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is nice, hubby likes it too.</li>
    <li> This body wash has a great lather and the smell is to die for! It pairs nicely with the body spray!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I was searching for a paraben-free body wash.  I was happy to find that the scent is mild; much less &amp;#34;grapefruity&amp;#34; than I had expected, which I like. I will most likely order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> This bath gel is so yummy without any of the bad stuff like sulfates &amp; parabens in it! The fragrances are perfect without being overwhelming or underwhelming or setting off my fragrance allergies! Thanks for making a product without floral overkill. I LOVE this!</li>
    <li> I like having a rejuvenating and mellowing scent available depending on the type of day I woke up to. This is a great scent for waking up. Vitabath is the only body wash that I use anymore. My skin is left soft with no residue from sulfates found in other body washes. Lather is awesome as well.</li>
