      <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>

      <li>I love Its smell, texture, color, and presentation.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>No smell and glides on smoothly.</li>

      <li>I ordered 2 more bottles before I actually found out.</li>

    <li> Well, when I first got the package I took a shower and used it right away. Then after about a week or two I noticed that my hair was actually staring to get longer. Because everyone was like your hair looks longer!! I love this product!! I think I will use this everyday!!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair I could have bought it at Sally&#x27;s and saved some money but it&#x27;s ok it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product for over 40 years..!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my niece who swore by this product, so I decided that I will try it and to my surprise it makes my hair feel so soft and it brings a lot of body to my hair. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to go natural, especially for little girls.  Wish it was in all the beauty supplies stores I had to go online to find it.</li>
    <li> I love it. I love Its smell, texture, color, and presentation. This hair cream it&#x27;s very pleasant.  I&#x27;ll continue buying it.</li>
    <li> I love palmers, but I think it is cheaper in the hair store than the internet and you get a bigger jar</li>
    <li> Zero stars as the product is fake. The package arrived broken, the prints on the jar are fake and are different than the original packaging. the consistency is like glue and smells like glue. Went to straight to the bin as shipping it back from outside the states is not worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I have ever known and I had been searching frantically for it and finally saw it on Amazon. Thanks guys, I have it now. Great for all hair types</li>
    <li> Love The Smell, My Hair Is Growing &amp; It Keeps My Hair Shiny And New. Will Be Buying Forever And Ever</li>
    <li> my hair actually grew faster it used to grow an inch every month or so now it grows about 3 every week it really does work.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for two weeks no results. My baby hair hasn&#x27;t crowed yet</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet....</li>
    <li> Since I was younger my mother used this in my hair about 5yrs old... I am 26 now. Its one of the best hair oil for hair because not only isn&#x27;t it greasy but it absorbs and keeps in moister. I would definitely recommend for people who have natural hair it really makes it soft and for people who have relaxed hair it really does promote growth especially if your hair is relaxed and you corn row it. One of the best growth oil. In my areas (Bronx NY)it used to be sort of cheap but now its like 12.00 a jar. Worth it esp for hair growth and strength.</li>
    <li> Good product and it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and I don&#x27;t know what she thought about it I didn&#x27;t hear any complaints it must be good.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, feels good, smells great, I use on my hair and beard, keeping both healthy, thick and smelling and looking good!</li>
    <li> This product works great for my daughters hair it holds their ponytails in place, gives hair shine and doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy.</li>
    <li> This makes your hair very dry and brittle. I ordered 2 more bottles before I actually found out.</li>
    <li> I thought that mineral oil as first ingredient sounded not that great, but this product had very good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. Used a bit after washing and drying my hair, as the instructions recommend for everyday use - it made my hair look very oily, so I had to wash it again. Well, I thought it would work better as a rinse out treatment, so I tried it a couple of days later (rinse out application is recommended on weekly basis)... The stuff didn&#x27;t rinse out with water and I used just a little bit of the product! I shampooed hair four times to get it off. My hair still felt coated. Not \\&quot;bouncy, full of life, moisturized coated\\&quot;, but \\&quot;I&#x27;ve just spread a stick of butter over my hair coated\\&quot;. I literally had to stay inside all weekend. Washing it again, twice with clarifying shampoo the other day didn&#x27;t help, the stuff came off a little, but I still had to wear a head scarf to work - that is how oily my hair looked. The only positive thing I noticed is that the treatment conditions my nail cuticles - at least I can use it for something. I have tried a lot of hair conditioning products, this is the biggest disappointment so far, it actually caused trouble in my case. My hair is chin long, natural, had highlights done one year ago, no hair color, so the product couldn&#x27;t be affected by chemicals or etc.. Also the water is very soft in my area. This treatment might work for someone with long hair, applying just to dry ends very little and very carefully.</li>
    <li> I currently have natural twists and this works perfectly to moisturize my scalp and to keep my baby hairs and new growth down. Def recommend this for upkeep on braids or twists.</li>
