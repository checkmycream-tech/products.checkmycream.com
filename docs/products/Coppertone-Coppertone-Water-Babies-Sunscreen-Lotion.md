      <li>My favorite sunscreen for the kiddos.</li>
      <li>but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.</li>
      <li>The more zinc, the more protection</li>
      <li>It was the only one in that category rated Excellent for both UVA and UVB protection.</li>

      <li>If chemicals are not disturbing, then roofing tar offers the best sun protection on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good but very oily.</li>
      <li>there are few brands out there with good ingredients and great protection.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Safety measures: While a dissipated efficiency does not mean consumers are not receiving any protection at all, Consumer Report recommends that sunscreen is reapplied every two hours when sweating and swimming to ensure the best result, but would not recommend Coppertone&#x27;s Sensitive Skin, No-Ad Sport, or Up &amp; Up&#x27;s Kids formula.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light</li>
      <li>And no one believes my age (over 60)  because my skin is smooth</li>
      <li>(The primary category did not include sprays or &amp;#34;ultrahigh SPF,&amp;#34; both of which included products rating higher.)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I particularly like &amp;#34;Water Babies&amp;#34; because it goes on smoothly and had a nice smell.  </li>
      <li>Purchased after consistently seeing it year after year in the top sunscreens as ranked by CR.</li>
      <li>my skin looks a good 10 years younger.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Coppertone Water Babies Pure and Simple for a year with great results.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen is rated first in its July 2014 issue by Consumer Reports, out of 11 considered in the primary category.</li>
      <li>A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane and alcohol.</li>

      <li>you will not get protection as good as Water Babies 50SPF in PURE &amp; SIMPLE mix.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Additionally, the product contains oxybenzone, which is a synthetic estrogen that is absorbed through the skin.</li>
      <li>The thing I love most about this sunscreen is that it is not too thick or too runny; it rubs in quickly and easily</li>
      <li>For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution.</li>
      <li>For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You should also be aware that the Coppertone folks recommend against buying the product on Amazon, because of the prospect of receiving a product too close to its expiration date.</li>
      <li>BABIES PURE &amp; SIMPLE:&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and it really protects you from UV.</li>
      <li>I try it on and it works very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and it really protects you from UV.</li>
      <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
      <li>Thanks a million for your gifts,I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
      <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
      <li>stars and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Amazon is very cooperative in situations like these, and immediately refunded my payment.</li>
      <li>My 11 month old didn&#x27;t get an allergic reaction or sunburn while in Aruba, so that&#x27;s worth five stars to me.</li>
      <li>I try it on and it works very well.</li>
      <li>When I first apply it, it looks white for a couple of minutes but quickly fades before it is time to put my make up on.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t investigated the reason for the difference, but I want to warn parents that this version is not as gentle as the other, it also smells much more perfumed, almost like a bug spray.  </li>
      <li>My son is very sensitive to some sunscreens and this one is both effective enough to prevent burns but gentle enough on his skin.</li>
      <li>For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc.</li>

      <li>We bought it since it was highly recommended by almost every Sun Screen articles we read on Internet this summer.</li>
      <li>Smells like baby lotion as expected and smooth feeling.</li>
      <li>It has really paid off because as a 70 year old</li>
      <li>Well, let me tell you, I noticed right away when I applied it to her face at the local splash pad.  </li>
      <li>How am i going to use 4 BOTTLES of NEW lotion in that time?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sprays are the most damaging type of any type of sunscreen due to their mix and where it may land, especially on the face and eyes.</li>
      <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Coppertone does not even disclose the ingredients on their Website and there is a reason; Read the ingredients, there is a major difference, a high amount of ZO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>were both very upset, obviously this isn&#x27;t something that should happen to a toddler using a BABY sunscreen!  </li>
      <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for young children.</li>
      <li>Ingredients: Water, Sorbitol, Aluminum Starch, OctenylSuccinate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Isostearate, Benzyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E)</li>
      <li>The next thing I knew, her right eye was bloodshot and her lid was starting to swell from the irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
      <li>If you go for the same brand by the Coppertone in Sensitive Skin 50SPF, or Water Babies</li>
      <li>A complicated shopping decision made easy!</li>
      <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>

<li> I am curious about water resistant function but seems solid.</li>
<li> which is like 1 and a half month later...</li>
<li> Such a waste.</li>
<li> now i spent almost $40 and its all going to waste.&lt;br</li>
<li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
<li> My production code began with 3A, which the Coppertone folks told me means 2013 January—in other words over 1½ years before I received it.</li>
<li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
<li> The thing is good, however the packing wrap is terrible.</li>
<li> Put all over and used in overcast weather, baby got slightly sunburned both days even with reapplying after about 30 minutes.  </li>
<li> (It also had an expiration code reflecting an expiration in less than a year, but I&#x27;m told that newer products will not display an expiration code.)</li>
<li> it can prevent the harm from sunshine but can&#x27;t stop the skin turn to black</li>
<li> /&gt;Lately,  I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it in stores.</li>
<li> Really odd, but very frustrating to throw away an entire bottle.  </li>
<li> It was no more greasy or uncomfortable than any other suncreen I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
<li> This person should have at least told me or something</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My 11 month old didn&#x27;t get an allergic reaction or sunburn while in Aruba, so that&#x27;s worth five stars to me.</li>
    <li> Consumer Reports #1 affordably priced family-friendly sunscreen, and that is why we use it. A complicated shopping decision made easy! Nice scent, goes on easily--we all use it. (Note: Cheaper at Target at times.)</li>
    <li> The container won&#x27;t stand either on its base or on its lid.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine why there is a fragrance in a product designated especially for babies, or for anyone else.  Fragrance attracted a wasp to sting me.  Fragrance attracts mosquitos.  Mosquito bites are unpleasant and can cause West Nile Fever.</li>
    <li> I bought this because waterbaby is famous in China and my sister love it. I try it on and it works very well. It&#x27;s not sticky and it really protects you from UV. Recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product! Purchased after consistently seeing it year after year in the top sunscreens as ranked by CR.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great</li>
    <li> I have taken order for 8 oz. but you sent me 10.64 oz.Thanks a million for your gifts,I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>

When I want to purchase a table saw I refer to Consumer Report not health concerns since Consumer Report does their tests on Chemical Sunscreens not Physical Sunscreens which are the worst ingredients in any sunscreen on the mix. Putting anything on human skin is the same as consuming it directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sprays are the most damaging type of any type of sunscreen due to their mix and where it may land, especially on the face and eyes. I use many brands and I will not use any sunscreen in any form recommended by Consumer Report since those are all chemical sunscreens when infact there are few brands out there with good ingredients and great protection. Target, Hawaiian Tropic, Copper tone, Nutrogina, etc. may offer protection but offer many unwanted chemicals as well. Bottom line, what ingredients are you looking for and how well it protects you for what you pay per ounce. If chemicals are not disturbing, then roofing tar offers the best sun protection on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddeningfor 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO. Sunscreens are worse than processed foods (which I never consume) since there is no nutritional guide for sunscreens. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun. For that reason, choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high zinc oxide is the best solution. A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful of ingredients, certified organic at least 95% and FREE OF; fragrances, biologically harmful chemicals like Avobenzone, Oxybenzone, or UV Chemical absorbers, paraben, phthalates, PABA and 1,4 dioxane and alcohol. What goes on the skin is the same as being consumed through the skin. Chemicals, alcohol and fragrances are no protection for the skin.for 15 times longer - 150 minutes.

What goes on the skin is the same as being consumed through the skin. Chemicals, alcohol and fragrances are no protection for the skin.</li>
    <li> This gave my young son a terrible rash that is taking days to go away.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the product contains oxybenzone, which is a synthetic estrogen that is absorbed through the skin. I would recommend this product for young children.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dermatologist almost 30 years ago to use sunscreen on my face 365 days a year and I have followed his advice faithfully.  It has really paid off because as a 70 year old my skin looks a good 10 years younger.  In the summer time I use it on my arms and legs.  I particularly like &amp;#34;Water Babies&amp;#34; because it goes on smoothly and had a nice smell.  When I first apply it, it looks white for a couple of minutes but quickly fades before it is time to put my make up on.  I recommend this product for all ages.</li>
    <li> This was really greasy and smelled horrible. I returned this.</li>
    <li> The thing is good, however the packing wrap is terrible. Something wrong with the top and they used tape to fix it, which made me feel bad.</li>
    <li> We bought it since it was highly recommended by almost every Sun Screen articles we read on Internet this summer.</li>
    <li> It protected my skin nicely, even on sweaty runs, meaning it is more waterproof than most. It was no more greasy or uncomfortable than any other suncreen I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Way too many estrogen mimicking ingredients</li>
    <li> it can prevent the harm from sunshine but can&#x27;t stop the skin turn to black</li>
    <li> top 5 for consumer reports</li>
    <li> I have been using Coppertone Water Babies Pure and Simple for a year with great results.  I inadvertently picked up a two pack of this, the regular Water Babies Sunscreen, not realizing the difference.  Well, let me tell you, I noticed right away when I applied it to her face at the local splash pad.  We applied it everywhere, liberally like we always do.  Unfortunately some got in her eyes when she rubbed them.  The next thing I knew, her right eye was bloodshot and her lid was starting to swell from the irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were both very upset, obviously this isn&#x27;t something that should happen to a toddler using a BABY sunscreen!  Why does Coppertone even make a version that is not Tear Free?!  I haven&#x27;t investigated the reason for the difference, but I want to warn parents that this version is not as gentle as the other, it also smells much more perfumed, almost like a bug spray.  I can still smell it on my shoulders four hours after application.</li>
    <li> it stains clothes copper!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen for the kiddos. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Stays on well.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is rated first in its July 2014 issue by Consumer Reports, out of 11 considered in the primary category. It was the only one in that category rated Excellent for both UVA and UVB protection. (The primary category did not include sprays or &amp;#34;ultrahigh SPF,&amp;#34; both of which included products rating higher.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before deciding, you might want to consider the recommendations of the Environmental Working Group at ewg.org. EWG does *not* recommend this Coppertone product, because of reservations about what EWG considers questionable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should also be aware that the Coppertone folks recommend against buying the product on Amazon, because of the prospect of receiving a product too close to its expiration date. Sunscreens expire in two to three years. This product has a production code that&#x27;s virtually impossible to see unless you know where to look, and look very carefully. It&#x27;s embossed on the back of the blue cap. My production code began with 3A, which the Coppertone folks told me means 2013 January—in other words over 1½ years before I received it. (It also had an expiration code reflecting an expiration in less than a year, but I&#x27;m told that newer products will not display an expiration code.) Amazon is very cooperative in situations like these, and immediately refunded my payment.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Was on Consumer Reports list as 2nd highest for sun protection! I use it for myself! Received product really fast &amp; customer service was great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but very oily. Also it is not convenient to put on than those sprays.</li>
    <li> best rated sunscreen by c r</li>
    <li> Good things. I bought this because waterbaby is famous in China and my sister love it. I try it on and it works very well. It&#x27;s not sticky and it really protects you from UV. Recommend this.</li>
    <li> The thing I love most about this sunscreen is that it is not too thick or too runny; it rubs in quickly and easily and my kids don&#x27;t freak out about putting it on their faces because it doesn&#x27;t take 10 minutes to rub it in!  The fragrance is light and I really love the smell. I saw some reviewers complaining about bugs being attracted to it, but that has not been an issue for us at all. My son is very sensitive to some sunscreens and this one is both effective enough to prevent burns but gentle enough on his skin. I love it-5 stars and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Got tricked...Ordered it on June 10 for 4 bottles and it arrived today. The problem was all 4 bottles&#x27; expiration dates were August- which is like 1 and a half month later... How am i going to use 4 BOTTLES of NEW lotion in that time? Such a waste. This person should have at least told me or something cause now i spent almost $40 and its all going to waste.&lt;br /&gt;  TRIED to contact the seller through e-mails but this person just wont reply... so frustrated....</li>
    <li> If you are consumer report user, you will know this is the one of best sunscreen lotion. Smells like baby lotion as expected and smooth feeling. I am curious about water resistant function but seems solid.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for probably 30 years!&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended it because it works well but does&lt;br /&gt;not cause zits.  And no one believes my age (over 60)  because my skin is smooth&lt;br /&gt;and spotless.&lt;br /&gt;Lately,  I&#x27;ve had trouble finding it in stores. I hope they&lt;br /&gt;are not going to discontinue it! It is perfect for a fair-skinned person.&lt;br /&gt;It works well under make-up, too.  I just bought four bottles for fear they&lt;br /&gt;might discontinue it. Hope not!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic skin, after use is very moist, the effect is very good, suitable for summer use. Very good, recommended the use of</li>
    <li> not good and expensive than that in the supermarket</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It is one of the few sunscreens I am not allergic too (I&#x27;m weird and am allergic to just about every lotion out there)</li>
    <li> Put all over and used in overcast weather, baby got slightly sunburned both days even with reapplying after about 30 minutes.  Also think it might have attracted bugs, as she had multiple bug bites and I had none using a different sunscreen.  I have used the spray version and did not have this issue.  Really odd, but very frustrating to throw away an entire bottle.  Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Great for me and the kids.  I use it on my face.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance, good coverage</li>
