      <li>Easy on, easy off!  </li>
      <li>This was a good price and the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>The CND Shellac product is easy to apply and maintain.</li>
      <li>The best thing is that during the nail prep, you don&#x27;t have to buff your natural nails, which to me tends to weaken the nails no matter how gentle you are.</li>
      <li>You have to use a UV light to cure this.</li>
      <li>away from the light source, or it will harden immediately.</li>
      <li>It works great and I am saving $$ by doing them myself after about a $100 investment which would equal 3 trips to the salon.</li>
      <li>I got the UV light and some colors, and it they paid for themselves in just 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
      <li>Super easy.</li>
      <li>Brushes on super easily.</li>
      <li>Best process for creating beautiful nails, and giving otherwise weak and fragile nails strong protection that I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
      <li>makes nail polish last as thought their acriclic nails, good price also, will continue to use it and recommend to friends</li>
      <li>So I removed the polish per the instructions (very easy to soak off, not messy) and applied a new color on my own.</li>
      <li>Have ordered this product several times now and have been very satisfied with</li>
      <li>i recently purchased all the supplies to do shellac at home, and am loving it.  </li>
      <li>i did a special-design french tip over romantique tonight, and am pleased with the results (my first stamped tips!).  </li>
      <li>I decided that I could do my nails at home and this product certainly helps!  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.++++AAAAA</li>
      <li>The polish was exactly what I wanted and what is used in the salon.  </li>
      <li>B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is required first step product.</li>
      <li>Fast!</li>
      <li>When used with the UV light source, the results are professional.  </li>
      <li>I have several CND colors and love to do nail art.  </li>
      <li>the best for base and top.  </li>
      <li>I have never had the shellac professionally done, I compared how much it would cost to purchase all the products and it was worth the investment.</li>
      <li>I can do a whole manicure for myself in 10-15 minutes.</li>
      <li>and she loves it so much</li>
      <li>It makes my own nails stronger and I can usually go 8-14 days between changes.</li>
      <li>It is a great prodct and truly does last at least 14 days.</li>
      <li>being done over the top of the shellac, regular polish tends to last longer as well, and you can konad too!  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS NORMAL.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thinner and the brush is a normal sized brush.  </li>
      <li>Arrived on time in new condition.</li>
      <li>As long as you do thin coats, cure properly and use the alcohol your nails will be gorgeous for two full weeks.</li>
      <li>It lasts long enough for me to enjoy it.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve also found that you can use a regular polish over the top if you&#x27;d like to switch things up before the shellac begins to break down.  </li>
      <li>The shellac process is so fast to do at home, especially for those busy moms.</li>
      <li>With all the others that I have tried, you always have to buff the natural nails as part of the prep.</li>
      <li>Then cure it under a UV lamp and you&#x27;re ready to apply your next coat.</li>
      <li>This is lasting much longer.</li>
      <li>So far I can get about 7-10 days out of the shellac nails before they start chipping</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 3 months now and love the results.  </li>
      <li>but so far I like the CND brand</li>
      <li>Just be sure not to apply it too thick.</li>
      <li>The only reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is more convenient to buy the small one, for storage purposes.</li>
      <li>(I save a little time by putting both hands under the UV light at the same time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the CND brand for base and top coats.  </li>
      <li>As far as quality goes, I would have to say that both have been equal for me.</li>
      <li>The key to using this is applying a thin coat, and make sure the cuticle has been pushed back/removed.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use the lamp, the polish will NOT dry.</li>
      <li>but well worth the extra trouble.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Four Reasons to buy this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Save $ over the salons. I got the UV light and some colors, and it they paid for themselves in just 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001RMP7M6 Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Super easy. I have found it easier to use that traditional polishes. Brushes on super easily. Might because there is no time for me to smudge anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Fast! I can do a whole manicure for myself in 10-15 minutes. (I save a little time by putting both hands under the UV light at the same time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. LONGER LASTING than traditional polishes. Mine typically last 2 weeks and then i start to get a little peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. PROTECTS YOUR NAILS. I started to actually get talons. I had to cut them down. My nails have never reached longer lengths.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does exactly what it should. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and the seller. I&#x27;m saving a ton of money doing my shellac manicures from home!</li>
    <li> Good! Rec‘d so quickly, I very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I decided that I could do my nails at home and this product certainly helps!  It works just like in the salon.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my at home shellac nails. It works great and I am saving $$ by doing them myself after about a $100 investment which would equal 3 trips to the salon. The base coat will feel sticky after you bake it for the 10 seconds in a nail dryer. THIS IS NORMAL. It has to be sticky to allow the color polish to adhere. So far I can get about 7-10 days out of the shellac nails before they start chipping and I start picking it off.</li>
    <li> Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
    <li> I bought this so I could do Shellac nails at home and I love it!  I&#x27;m currently at 2 1/2 weeks of wear on the polish I put on!!!  This isn&#x27;t hard to do at home if you have the supplies. Would definitely get it again</li>
    <li> The key to using this is applying a thin coat, and make sure the cuticle has been pushed back/removed. You have to use a UV light to cure this. After the base, apply a few coats of the Shellac color (curing after each coat), and then use the top coat. Cure, then wipe with alcohol. As long as you do thin coats, cure properly and use the alcohol your nails will be gorgeous for two full weeks.</li>
    <li> This is much easier to put on than Harmony&#x27;s base coat.  It&#x27;s thinner and the brush is a normal sized brush.  I have not noticed that it wears any better than Harmony.  As far as quality goes, I would have to say that both have been equal for me.</li>
    <li> I love shellac! I always buy these big bottles because they last longer.  This was a good price and the shipping was fast. Happy camper here!</li>
    <li> This is the only polish I can wear. It lasts long enough for me to enjoy it. It is not like regular polish, on one day gone the next.</li>
    <li> When used with the UV light source, the results are professional.  Just be careful that you keep the brush... away from the light source, or it will harden immediately.</li>
    <li> I have never had the shellac professionally done, I compared how much it would cost to purchase all the products and it was worth the investment. Product works well, make sure to cover the end of the nail, I didn&#x27;t and the polish lifted and peeled off like a blanket.  I am trying it again tonight. The end result is glossy with a wet look finish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 3 months now and love the results.  Your manicure and polish really do last up to 14 days.   The shellac process is so fast to do at home, especially for those busy moms.</li>
    <li> i recently purchased all the supplies to do shellac at home, and am loving it.  i maybe need a little practice being neater, but that&#x27;s all me.  i&#x27;ve also found that you can use a regular polish over the top if you&#x27;d like to switch things up before the shellac begins to break down.  being done over the top of the shellac, regular polish tends to last longer as well, and you can konad too!  i did a special-design french tip over romantique tonight, and am pleased with the results (my first stamped tips!).  bonus - you can &#x27;erase&#x27; with non-acetone polish if you screw up really bad!</li>
    <li> The only reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is more convenient to buy the small one, for storage purposes.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful and truly lasts 2 weeks.  Be sure you follow the directions for application and lamp.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.Product as expected</li>
    <li> CND is a great quality brand and has great products. This base coat is very easy to apply. Then cure it under a UV lamp and you&#x27;re ready to apply your next coat. It lasts a good amount too. Just be sure not to apply it too thick.</li>
    <li> I love CND Shellac Nail polish. This is a bigger bottle so I expect to get a lot of manicures out of this bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this with the top coat, I have no complaints, I just wish I could stop picking at it so it will last...I did my mom&#x27;s and she loves it so much, just don&#x27;t forget to wipe off the nail with alcohol after you cure it, if it weren&#x27;t for another review, I would have returned these.</li>
    <li> The CND Shellac product is easy to apply and maintain. The colors are attractive, it stays very glossy and looks wonderful. The problem is that for me, it doesn&#x27;t last two weeks as they say it will. I had one manicure done in a salon and within 3 days, two nails chipped, one nail cracked and one nail peeled. So I removed the polish per the instructions (very easy to soak off, not messy) and applied a new color on my own. This is lasting much longer. I&#x27;ve had this second manicure on for a week without a chip. It doesn&#x27;t make my nails any stronger though. Two of my nails split up the nail and they do advertise that this will be reduced but I don&#x27;t feel that the nail woes I had in the past have been aided by using this polish. I&#x27;m going to try OPI&#x27;s version (Axxium) instead.</li>
    <li> I love the CND brand for base and top coats.  I am experimenting a little with other gel brands for color but so far I like the CND brand the best for base and top.  It seems they are easier to remove and protect my gel/shellac manicures well.  Usually lasts between 10 to 14 days.</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver! I love shellac and this works great! I even use it with China glaze&#x27;s Gelaze which has a built in base coat for extra staying power and I have client getting 3-4 weeks staying power!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time in new condition. Great price on a product of the highest quality. I love CND!</li>
    <li> Have ordered this product several times now and have been very satisfied with it&#x27;s quality and performance.  My manicures at home are just as good as the salon manicures I have had!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re into CND Nail coating, this is an integral part of the process, and available here at a good price.  Best process for creating beautiful nails, and giving otherwise weak and fragile nails strong protection that I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gellish on my nails for several months and decided to try CND shellac. I love how much more durable this product is. It makes my own nails stronger and I can usually go 8-14 days between changes. Remember this is a soak-off product... but well worth the extra trouble.</li>
    <li> Glad I can use this product at home and not have to spend time at the salon.  It is more affordable that way.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as it is supposed to work.  Specified as a requirement for the CND Shellac system of polish.  Requires a UV lamp to cure the polish.  If you don&#x27;t use the lamp, the polish will NOT dry.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff I do nails and it works wonders with the top coat and i will continue to use this product ...</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.++++AAAAA</li>
    <li> The polish was exactly what I wanted and what is used in the salon.  The cost was great too, I definitely enjoy doing shellac at home.</li>
    <li> makes nail polish last as thought their acriclic nails, good price also, will continue to use it and recommend to friends</li>
    <li> I love the way shellac lasts, but it&#x27;s so expensive at the salons. I thought I&#x27;d give the at home shellac a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I wouldn&#x27;t skimp on a no name brand. CND is what my salon used, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> The best thing is that during the nail prep, you don&#x27;t have to buff your natural nails, which to me tends to weaken the nails no matter how gentle you are. With all the others that I have tried, you always have to buff the natural nails as part of the prep. It is not runny like some others. It&#x27;s a thick consistency, but it self levels.</li>
    <li> Use this shellac weekly on my nails, love it. works great as I am allergic to acrylic and no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails at home and love CND Shellac. It is a great prodct and truly does last at least 14 days. My nails always look amazing and I get a ton of compliments. I also love the colors and the option to layer and create new colors is awesome.</li>
    <li> I was able to order this online and now am saving myself the cost and time of going to the salon! Works great and lasts for 2 full weeks and longer!!</li>
    <li> The CND line has been the perfect answer for me in getting perfect nails that people complement me on all the time.</li>
    <li> CND is the brand that I like the best.  The under coat works well and again I like the larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is a replacement product. It is required first step product. my wife and daughters love the shellac products.</li>
    <li> I love CND shellac.  Buy it.  Easy on, easy off!  Highly recommended.  I have several CND colors and love to do nail art.  You will too.</li>
