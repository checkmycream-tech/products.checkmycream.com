    <li> These hair extensions are very good quality. They blend very well and the clips are the same color as the hair. The hair itself is very soft and not dry at all. They are easy to clip in and you can wear your hair any way with them in. I think they look the best with your hair down, but you can even pull your hair all the way up or half way up and you cannot see the clips at all. Overall great quality hair extensions for a great price!  I would definitely recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love. ... great quality</li>
    <li> It was not a real human hair! It was fake , plastic and dont recommended at all! It was fraud!</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this not only my neck gets red and itchy, but also hair from the extensions keeps falling down. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not a good texture hair too shiny looks synthetic.  Don&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
    <li> Pretty decent for the price I will purchase  this items again, it&#x27;s blend really well with my hair texture and color.</li>
    <li> Very good price and it completely blended with my hair. Everyone says it looks real and I can straighten or curl it and it will not burn like other products.</li>
    <li> This hair is soft and looks very natural . I will be purchasing again !! It isnt too thin or too thick</li>
    <li> This is a joke and should be taken out of circulation. This is junk but, I am stuck with it because the packaging got tossed. Clips are cheap and do not hold firm in your hair. Suppose to be human hair but feels like synthetic. I do not recommend, shop you local beauty supply and save yourself some frustration.</li>
    <li> I personally did not like it. The texture, even though it was stated as Yaki, felt nothing like it nor did it look like it. Each piece of extension, had little hair to add to. It only looked as though I had hair when I put multiple pieces of them together. The ends looked extremely damaged and they probably even were. The texture was also, literally, 80% rough and 20% soft. It also had a very chemical and synthetic smell to it when it came out of the package. It looks like nothing like it does in the picture. It&#x27;s not that thick at all. It&#x27;s thin and brittle and it also took a while for the clips to close. It also has EXTREME amounts of shedding! As I was putting it on, multiple strands of hair kept falling and fell even afterwards. It also felt as though the clips were tugging on the hair the first time I put it on but it stopped afterwards. Overall, I would not recommend purchasing this item/product as it did not live up to it&#x27;s expectations and came nowhere close to the texture described/stated in the overview.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered fast. Hair is not the same as shown. This hair is like doll hair believe me do not get you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair! The texture is her perfect match, would have given 5 stars but the hair is lighter then stated. Looks like you have some faint highlights when in the sun.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these hair extensions! They look and feel just like real human hair, and I love that I can curl and style these just like real hair! Beautiful!</li>
    <li> Not as much volume as I thought it would give my hair.</li>
    <li> not bad but not goodeither</li>
    <li> I like this hair, the shipping was fast. I have natural black hair but when I straighten my hair it blends right in. The texture is good and the clip ins are strong. The 14 inch length is also really good for people who don&#x27;t want long long hair. The texture is good as well. I don&#x27;t have any dislikes so far, but I gave it a 4 because lots of people said it sheds a lot, I see a but of shedding but It not really bothering me because the hair on the clips seem to be on tight. I did a tutorial on this exact hair, its -----&gt; [...]</li>
    <li> Great hair.  Amazing texture came on time. Slightly sheds.  Beautiful natural looking hair for African Americans.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair…I pressed it hone straight.&lt;br /&gt;The match was so  good…that I couldn&#x27;t tell where my hair ended and the clip in began.&lt;br /&gt;A really great product.</li>
    <li> Tried the curling iron on it.. didnt hold at all in humidity even if I sprayed it. Loved the sleekiness though.</li>
    <li> for a yaki texture it is too silky and the 1B is way to brown. It was a good amount of hair but didn&#x27;t meet my requirements...</li>
    <li> it  turned  out  great. I  loved  it I would  also recommend  it  to  others.  it blended, well  with  my  own  hair</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the quality and absolutely hate this hair.  This hair looks to be old, brittle, and dry.  Very poor quality hair...the description says it all, &#x27;Cheap&#x27;.  I will never wear this hair, instead I gave it to my daughter to play around with. Do not waste your money on this one.</li>
