      <li>PLUS it costs more!</li>

      <li>Feel free to message me if you have any questions!!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this for my hair!</li>
      <li>More manageable hair and price is amazing!</li>
      <li>Also, if you use this and the first time you don&#x27;t have perfect results DON&#x27;T get discouraged please!</li>
      <li>but when I did my hair looked amazing.</li>
      <li>But it added amazing body and softness to my hair, plus made it so silky that detangling after washing was a</li>
      <li>and THEN my hair felt amazing, like I</li>
      <li>have to say I am thrilled with the results.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really loving the results.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a good smelling conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also liked the consistency of the product.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried it with my own products and</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing it again, for both me and my sister who saw the results of my hair and asked who did your hair, it looks so nice.</li>
      <li>It would be nice to find an affordable, effective, and formaldehyde-free keratin treatment I can do at home to save</li>
      <li>The process was fairly time consuming and would probably work better if you had a friend help you.</li>
      <li>and my hair did get a bit wavy but nice wavy.  </li>
      <li>Had to use my own shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I do need to redo my color after a treatment, because it does warm and lighten a bit</li>
      <li>My hair is perfectly managable, can be blow-dried with just using my fingers, or, if I use a brush to blow it out, it will be straight and sleek and will stay that way</li>
      <li>Since I did use up the clarifying shampoo that came with the treatment, I had to use my own and used a high-quality keratin shampoo with seemingly no difference.</li>
      <li>It honestly felt like a mangled dogs hair.  </li>
      <li>This is THE best keratin treatment and in my opinion far superior than salon treatments.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s well worth it!!!</li>
      <li>Happy that I was able to wash my hair out right after :)</li>
      <li>I have used the 30 day Keratin treatment AND the 30 day BOLD with good results.</li>
      <li>Easy application, nice results.</li>
      <li>it looks like it smoothed kinks more over time.</li>
      <li>; I decided to try this because I have these baby hairs that stick up on the top of my head, and wanted to get rid of them.</li>
      <li>Smells better than the salon version, too</li>
      <li>After 2 weeks, however, my hair became drier and more unruly.  </li>
      <li>I also have tried the Sally&#x27;s ion 30 day (OK) and Keratin Research.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t las60 days, more like 30</li>
      <li>longer hair needs more than one packet for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>probbrar more</li>
      <li>I used a metal vented brush which I feel got my kinky roots straighter and more relaxed.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I may get a better result.</li>
      <li>my hair and my daughters hair is just as healthy and silky as ever.</li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t my favorite bc</li>
      <li>It was if the product had magically disappeared, never to return.  </li>
      <li>I am in love.</li>
      <li>I ended up with knots ( more like dreadlocks)</li>
      <li>I love every Liquid Keratin product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>that I had to cut out of my hair most came after each wash</li>
      <li>it will turn out better.</li>
      <li>I have used many keratin treatments of varying strengths at home and at the salon.  </li>
      <li>Will update this review as time will tell whether this &amp;#34;60 Day&amp;#34;treatment works any better or longer, but the most I&#x27;d give is 4 stars because of the packaging discrepancy.  </li>
      <li>More of a controllable beach wave I have going on.  </li>
      <li>Great price and fast shipper</li>
      <li>The more you do the Keratin treatments,</li>
      <li>I will continue to use WEN in order to make sure it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and love the added benefit of how healthy this keratin protein has made my hair.</li>
      <li>Better than any salon treatment I&#x27;ve EVER had.</li>
      <li>process took 4 hours start to finish, which would be okay if it lasted a while.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and maybe I&#x27;ll see more result.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have ( hispanic) bushy, dry, brittle, hair that left alone would be shaped like a pyramid Dora style :) I used a child&#x27;s black hair relaxer a week prior to using this liquid Keratin. I was a bit apprehensive as my hair was still recovering from the relaxer pretty dry and brittle.  I followed the directions til it got to the part where you are supposed to flat iron the Keratin in your hair. Well I got interrupted by the air conditioner guy and by the time bedtime came I totally forgot and woke up the next day with really hard crusty Keratin hair lol...I went ahead and flat ironed it was pretty tangled ugh!! I let it cool then I rinsed it, conditioned with Keratin conditioner. I ending up having to run an errand and it dried by itself. When I finally got home flat ironed it. After not following the directions exactly I wasn&#x27;t too sure how it was going to come out. It is stick straight. So I will give it a few weeks and come back to update. Oh and if you have a lot of hair or its really long you might need a second bottle. My hair is thick about 2 inches past my shoulder and I had just enough</li>
    <li> I love this product.... My sister pays $250 at a local salon, now I do her hair also. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the salon product, but for the price it&#x27;s a no brainier. We take a day and everyone gets their hair done.&lt;br /&gt;👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I have used this product once. My hair is much softer and I can dry/style it in 15 min.</li>
    <li> This stuff softened my curls quite a bit and took away all the frizzies.  Somewhat labor intensive - took about 3 hours, but I like the results.  It seemed to be fairly gentle, didn&#x27;t burn but it did tingle - made me want to scratch.  I should note that it did lighten my hair color, but I like it - went from a medium golden brown to light golden brown.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions as instructed, including shampooing and conditioning as little as possible and only using sulfate free products. It worked wonderfully for the first few weeks, then slowly began to fade away after that. I would say I had really noticeable results for about a month, definitely not 60 days, which is why I gave it a 3.</li>
    <li> i like it, ill keep using it.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan. Smelled kind of weird when I got my hair wet. And maybe worked for one or two washes before I was back to frizz. Not worth the money in my opinion. Plus, it takes FOREVER to do the first time. Almost  hours with hair past my shoulders.</li>
    <li> I spent three hours doing my hair and it didn&#x27;t straighten! It did feel softer though. While I believe that I followed directions properly, I am wondering if I didn&#x27;t use a hot enough setting on my iron or go over the section enough times.</li>
    <li> Followed the directions and N-O-T-H-I-N-G. On top of the fact that this didn&#x27;t work, it left a foul smell on my hair. And the smell has lasted through 2 shampoos so far. Time to go to the salon to have it professionally done... Sigh.... (If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; at the end of my review!)</li>
    <li> I was all ready to use this product when I opened and read instructions to find out the shampoo and leave-in conditioner were not included.  The instructions are misleading; I wish I knew that everything needed was not included and I would have bought them!</li>
    <li> After the second wash my hair felt the same it was before, I don&#x27;t feel it reduced my frizz. :/</li>
    <li> To be completely honest, this product didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as i thought it would. It took about 6 hours to do ( I have long hair and air-dried most of it) and ended up lasting until my next wash, so in total, about 3 days. It was very straight for those 3 days and i actually ended up leaving the keratin in my hair after straightening it rather than rinsing it out. After washing my hair, it immediately went back to being type 2c frizzy hair, and to be completely honest, it seemed even frizzier than before, the product wasn&#x27;t thick enough and my hair got a little burned on the ends. The only good thing about this product was that it lightened my hair color, but it did nothing else in the long run.</li>
    <li> Love it! Miami summer humidity is here and I really needed to take my mane. My new budget doesn&#x27;t like the idea of blowing $200 every 8-10 weeks on salon treatments. I really truly have difficult ethnic hair but this has made things sooo much more bearable. Drying time is significantly faster and when I flat iron my hair it gets super straight, smooth and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny. It works amazing as long as you put it on in very small sections. If you have ever had your hair professionally straightened then you should know how to do it.</li>
    <li> I have thick, frizzy, wavy hair and this was great at getting rid of the frizz and taming the wave for about 4 weeks.  I loved the fact that I could wash my hair immediately and didn&#x27;t have to live with greasy hair for 3 days, like I used to have to do with the salon treatment.  So between that and the price, I&#x27;m okay that it only lasted a month.  I would give it 5 stars except I do not like the rotten earthy smell.  Its okay when my hair is dry but the smell is not good when its wet.  (edited on Nov 13 - I had originally omitted the word &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; - I do NOT like the smell.)</li>
    <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but already have a complaint.  The pre-treat shampoo came as a packet inside a small ziploc-type bag.  The packet was opened and the shampoo spilled into the bag...it actually &amp;#34;ate&amp;#34; away the lettering on the packet so I&#x27;m assuming its the pre-treatment (unclear on whether you re-use that after the whole thing) but can&#x27;t really tell.  Not sure yet if I can salvage enough to use on my long, thick hair....it arrived w/in the promised window but I&#x27;d hoped to be able to do the treatment yesterday and now may be delayed until early June (not their fault, only referenced since I may not know if it is workable)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this for my hair!</li>
    <li> Quite terrible if you ask me. I have coarse hair that is really frizzy. Was so excited to try this as it is quite affordable. Bitterly disappointed after the first wash. Hair takes FOREVER to dry and the frizz didn&#x27;t quite go.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time and keeps working through my routine washes.</li>
    <li> Difficult to squeeze the contents out took a long time followed instructions to the T left my hair as it should for TWO WEEKS I have been using a different product for two years thought I would try this for a change gone back to my original product&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
    <li> OK, so I am a Mixed Chick with really tight curly hair with a few wiry grays. It&#x27;s not strong, very frizzy and breaks easily. I used to use perms until my hair was so damaged, I grew it out natural. But combing out my hair after washing it was a nightmare! And my curls would shrink up from mid-back to above my shoulders - Not a great look. Fast forward to my first Keratin treatment by this brand, the 30-Day treatment. It worked Good the first time and slightly loosened my curls. But it added amazing body and softness to my hair, plus made it so silky that detangling after washing was a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done the 30-Day treatment another 2 times and each time my curls get looser, more touchable and really luscious! But, the process is lengthy and I have to work up the energy to do it. So, this time I purchased the **60-Day** treatment hoping it will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 60-Day treatment works just as well but the process is different. Also, the feel of the Keratin is different. Whereas the 30-Day treatment can be left in your hair for days and feels silky and fabulous; the 60-Day treatment feels thick like a cream and makes the hair sticky. After flat-ironing my hair, it looked like Klingon hair and I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through it. But the process calls for washing out the Keratin after flat-ironing it and THEN my hair felt amazing, like I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 30-DAY AND 60-DAY TREATMENTS:&lt;br /&gt;30-Day process is&lt;br /&gt;1- Pre-wash to strip the oils and products out of your hair&lt;br /&gt;2- Apply Keratin and comb through. Keratin is a silky liquid you spray. It did NOT irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;3- Blow Dry (works just as well if you air-dry naturally)&lt;br /&gt;4- Flat iron at 410 to 450 for best results&lt;br /&gt;At this point your hair looks and feels great. You wear it straight for 2-3 days. If it frizzes up, re-flat iron it. This is bonding the keratin to your hair. Then...&lt;br /&gt;5- Wash out keratin and condition hair. Style and wear as you like.&lt;br /&gt;The process (steps 1-4) takes about 2 hours. I find the 30-Day treatment lasts about 6-8 weeks. After the second treatment, I loved the way my hair looked and felt and was SOLD on Keratin treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;60-Day process is&lt;br /&gt;1- Pre-wash to strip the oils and products out of your hair&lt;br /&gt;2- Blow-dry to damp-dry. (I forgot this step and it turned out fine anyway.)&lt;br /&gt;3- Apply Keratin and comb through. Keratin is a sticky cream you pump, rub in your hands and spread on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;** This Keratin feels stronger and stung my face a little, but with no lasting harm.&lt;br /&gt;4- Blow Dry (works just as well if you air-dry naturally)&lt;br /&gt;5- Flat iron at 410 to 450 for best results&lt;br /&gt;At this point your hair is straight but is poufy and feels sticky. But, you are going to wash it out after like 15 minutes anyway so it really doesn&#x27;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;6- Wash out keratin and condition hair. Style and wear as you like. I ended up re-flat-ironing my hair after it air-dried.&lt;br /&gt;The process took me a whole afternoon, but I did other things while my hair bonding and air-drying. I don&#x27;t know how long this treatment will last because I just did it. But, my curls are loose, silky, long and I can run my fingers through them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THINGS TO REMEMBER&lt;br /&gt;- The more you do the Keratin treatments, the silkier and looser your curls will become.&lt;br /&gt;- You can over-flat iron your hair at too high a temp and loose your curls! I did this in some spots, so be careful not to use the flat-iron to \\&quot;bump\\&quot; your hair under at the ends or twist the flat-iron as you move down the hair. Lesson learned for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTH KERATIN TREATMENTS WILL WORK WITH OTHER SHAMPOOS AND CONDITIONERS. NO NEED TO BUY THE KIT!!&lt;br /&gt;Both Keratin treatments work with other pre-shampoos, after-shampoos and conditioners. I have tried it with the whole kit and I&#x27;ve tried it with my own products and both techniques work equally well. Here are the guidelines: The pre-shampoo is to strip all product build-up and oils from your hair. It can be a conventional, cheap shampoo like what you get at a hotel or a \\&quot;White-person\\&quot; shampoo. After the Keratin treatment, you DO NOT USE THIS TYPE OF SHAMPOO EVER AGAIN! You must use a shampoo that does not contain sulfates, i.e. sodium lauryl sulfate. This the the chemical that makes the shampoo suds up a lot. I use WEN conditioning cleanser and leave-in styling cream and it works equally well as the products in the Keratin Kit. If you use a shampoo with sulfates, it will strip the Keratin protein from your hair and undo the Keratin treatment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I redo my Keratin treatment whenever there is too much unruly new hair growth or when it starts to look frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this detailed review helps you decide which treatment to try. If the 60-Day treatment lasts A LOT longer, I&#x27;ll do it again even though the process takes longer and I don&#x27;t like the feel of the Keratin product. If it lasts about the same time as the 30-Day treatment, I prefer that product because it takes less time and I prefer the silky feel of the 30-Day Keratin product.rip all product build-up and oils from your hair.

    <li> Works, follow directions exactly...swimmer and really dry hair and made my hair look healthier not so frizzy but need to use karitin shampoo to keep lasting longer... With more use hair would probably improve even more!!!  Super thick hair with natural wave!</li>
    <li> I am mixed and my husband is white and my eldest daughter got the craziest hair from I don&#x27;t know what.  It is a big frizzy thick poof-ball unlike any other I have seen.  I was looking through pictures and I realized all her childhood photos had this crazy-haired white girl in it.  I have never wanted to give her a complex about it so I hesitated to do anything drastic, but those pictures. . .not good.  So I searched for something that would help her but without the harsh chemicals and smell, let alone formaldehyde and aldehyde. While we were having some bonding time with me washing her hair I realized I may have put off the treatment a little too long.  She told me she was really glad we were doing this because the other kids at school ask her if she brushes her hair at all. It was all I could hope that this treatment would at least give us a little control, knock down the poof a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tucked in a happy girl tonight.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but man is it better.  I was so worried I was going to have to make her wait until she was old enough to decide what chemicals she wanted in her hair, but this safe treatment has taken that worry away.  The bottle says that it improves with each treatment, and because I don&#x27;t subject her to blow dryers and flat irons, we may do it every 45 days the first few times without damaging anythings.  Her hair is shiny and has movement. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This has made no difference in my hair. I have fine, slightly wavy hair that frizzes out if not blow dried straight or flat ironed. The first hint of humidity and my hair puffs out. The only time it looked good was when we were done applying it and flat ironing my hair, it was great for the next 2 days until I washed it, now it&#x27;s back to it&#x27;s same fly away self. I&#x27;m using sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and have tried a keratin masque a few times to help it out, but no luck.  Even worse, my hair smells like wet dog when it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s quite unpleasant.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> great while it lasted. the stench when it&#x27;s wet goes away when it&#x27;s dry. get used to a gunky feeling, but sacrificing for smooth hair . doesn&#x27;t las60 days, more like 30</li>
    <li> While this did work very well for about three weeks, it is FAR from a 60 day treatment. In the fourth week, like magic, my hair went back to its frizzy, unruly natural state. I didn&#x27;t change anything about my hair care routine, and I always use sulfate and silicone free products. Other reviewers have noted that the &amp;#34;60 Day&amp;#34; label is taped over the original &amp;#34;30 Day&amp;#34; packaging, and although the manufacturer insists this was to cut down on production costs and save the bottles they already had, my experience makes me think it was just shady marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I will use the rest of the product, since it did work well for my hair in the super humid spring my area is having. I wouldn&#x27;t say it left my hair straight, so much as it made it much more manageable. I didn&#x27;t need to flat iron my hair at all for the three weeks it worked, and it relaxed my waves into something I felt I could leave the house with. It&#x27;s just not a 60 Day product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For reference: I am Caucasian with thick and frizzy wavy hair. My hair is not damaged from chemical treatments, though it might be from some heat styling. I bought this product to correct natural texture.)</li>
    <li> I never write reviews on products because I feel like I am repeating what everyone else has already said. However, I am SO impressed with this product and I want to help other women that struggle with curly, frizzy hair like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing salon keratin treatments on my hair for eight years now. To me is has been a GOD sent because I have very tight curls and I live in Miami, FL so humidity here is out of control. I have been on a tight budget lately and couldn&#x27;t afford to pay $200++ for the treatment. With summer coming I decided to try doing it myself at home. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but THIS PRODOCT has blown my mind my hair is super straight, sleek, and shiny!! If you have never done a keratin treatment before I warn you that the process is long and tedious so set 2 -3 hours aside. Obviously the longer( mine is mid-back), curlier , and thicker your hair the process  will take longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you have to wash your hair with the shampoo they provide.  DON&#x27;T put conditioner as it will affect the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Second, you have to let you hair dry about 80 % - 90%&lt;br /&gt;Third, put the keratin on you hair starting from the scalp to your ends&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, Blow Dry until it is 100% dry&lt;br /&gt;Firth, is the most difficult part because you have to piece by piece flat iron little portions of your hair until its fully straight. This is the MOST important part because it will seal the keratin into your hair. The instructions say to use a flat iron 410 - 450. Personally, I say go for 450 the hotter the better especially if your hair is really curly.&lt;br /&gt;Sixth, Wait 20 mins then rewash your hair this time use conditioner afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whew! I know a lot of work but totally worth it because your hair will look and feel amazing. I let mine air dry and it pretty much dried straight. Of course I still had to flat iron it after but a lot of the curls has gone down. Some things to keep in mind are that after you have the keratin treatment done youMUST use SULFATE - FREE shampoo/conditioner if you don&#x27;t the keratin will leave really fast. You don&#x27;t to buy the &amp;#34; Liquid Keratin&amp;#34; kit or products there are plenty of other cheaper sulfate- free products sold at Walgreens or Walmart. Personally I use L&#x27;oreal they are about $6 each bottle. They also sell a lot of leave - in conditioners and heat protection sprays for your hair. I use &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; but it can be a little pricey if your on a tight budget as long as you use one you will be fine! Also, if you use this and the first time you don&#x27;t have perfect results DON&#x27;T get discouraged please! Just wait a few weeks and do it again the second time around (once you already have some keratin in your hair) it will turn out better. The bottle should last you for at least one more time. Oh, and the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that my hair was super gunky and sticky while flat ironing but that is just how the product is and once your wash it off it won&#x27;t matter. It does smell at little bit when your are using the flat iron but its not that bad compared to other keratins as long as you leave the bathroom door open you will be fine. My scalp did burning a little bit but honestly not a big deal I think dying your hair is worst. Oh and speaking of dyed hair if your going to dye your hair DO IT BEFORE the keratin because if you do it after it will reopen your hair&#x27;s pores and the keratin with leave ( all that work for NOTHING)! Thing like going to the pool can also take the keratin away because the pool chemicals. Umm.. I can&#x27;t really think of anything else!  All I have to say is that this product works AMAZING and for the price it is unbeatable! PLEASE give it a try! I wish everyone who struggles with the doom or curly, frizzy, unruly hair the best of luck!! Liquid Keratin is truly the perfect solution! Feel free to message me if you have any questions!!</li>
    <li> Good result I just don&#x27;t like how it feels when you&#x27;re trying to dry it and flat iron it. Sticky and wax feeling</li>
    <li> The product was easy to use and had enough for two applications. The price was good. Look forward to next application.</li>
    <li> Ok I was REALLY hesitant to try this. Watched a lot of Youtube videos before hand. I have had my hair fall out once from a hair straightening when i was 17.  So needless to say I was scared. I just finished the complete process and my hair is still a little damp. So far my results are pretty great. When washing the product out my hair instantly felt lighter. I chose this product because you dont have to leave it in your hair for 2 days like the other brands. You do the process wait a little bit and wash out. It doesn&#x27;t really have to much of a smell either. My only tiny worry now is maybe it took too much of the curl and body out of my hair. I guess I will have to wait and see. It did not change the color of my hair either. My hair is dyed a light blonde.  The process was fairly time consuming and would probably work better if you had a friend help you. Especially the back of the head. Also you have to wash the hair brushes you use afterwards. The small packet of pre-shampoo that came with it broke open in the package. If you have really long hair, i dont think one packet would be enough. I have medium length hair and I barely got to washes out of it.  After the process i used my own sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and give the same result as a salon application for a fraction of the cost.  Leaves hair soft, conditioned, frizz free and manageable</li>
    <li> This stuff literally saved my hair. I have medium/long thick hair that is naturally somewhere between straight and wavy on its own. I got a perm about a month ago that was supposed to be a body wave, but I ended up looking like Shirley Temple. On top of that, it fried the ends of my hair. A YouTube guru I followed reviewed this stuff and my best friend had gotten me a gift card for my birthday, so what did I have to lose? My hair is soft and silky and all trace of the perm is absolutely gone. I am in love.</li>
    <li> always bought 30 days but 60 days probbrar more I like my hair is rebellious and dry with this product is easy to dry and leaves it shiny after the first wash, if you apply it with a good iron flat well the hair is fixed, current plates do not use</li>
    <li> I lov it easy to use and my hate is very soft  and great</li>
    <li> Wow Wow Wow! I usually spend 200 bucks at a salon for my keratin treatment and I like the results of liquid keratin better! Granted, it&#x27;s allot of work that you have to do yourself, and yes it dyes create smoke when you start the dough iron part-time.... But after opening some windows and bringing in a fan, it cleared in a few minutes.  The only downside is I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the pre shampoo that came with the treatment.. It doesn&#x27;t foam or spread well. I ended up using another clarifying shampoo and it seem seemed to work fine as well.</li>
    <li> I have that typical Southern Italian hair (course, curly, frizzy) and have been looking for a hair straightener that 1) is formaldehyde free (frizz-free hair is definitely not worth the health risks associated with putting formaldehyde on your head!), 2) non-permanent, 3) will allow me to keep some natural curl and 4) doesn&#x27;t smell completely awful. I finally found what Im looking for! A bonus: it didn&#x27;t destroy my hair at all (it&#x27;s very shiny and I didn&#x27;t notice any breakage, split ends, ect.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product I still have some natural curl, but now it&#x27;s a nice curl.  If I want my hair straight I just blow dry it with a flat brush, and it stays straight until I wash it. It has also cut down my styling time dramatically; it used to take me 45-60 minutes and a blow dryer and flat iron to get my hair straight, and now 10-15 minutes with a blow dryer only does the trick (I just run the iron through those top layer to get it styled). The bottle was enough for 2 uses (I have long hair).  It is not entirely chemical free, of course, but that there&#x27;s no formaldehyde is a HUGE plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the treatment about 2 months ago and I don&#x27;t foresee needing to touch it up again for a while.  My hair had a slight smell when wet for about a week after, but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering and went away.  The only con is that is it a little labor intensive (it took me about 2-3 hours, all said and done), but I was able to do it without enlisting my sister&#x27;s help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m super happy with the product and I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was trying to save money at the salon and bought this.  First off, my hair is not kinky, curly, or wavy, it is just frizzy with a lot of body but I like keratin to give me that &amp;#34;sleek&amp;#34; look.  The process took a while and once this stuff &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; on your hair, it is nearly impossible to &amp;#34;section&amp;#34; when you need to run the flat iron through it.  It honestly felt like a mangled dogs hair.  Once I washed it out, it was nice but not great.  I still needed to run the flat iron through it daily and I never got the exact results that I would from a keratin treatment in the salon.  And let me say, I have a salon flat iron and was very detailed in taking only 1/2 inch pieces of hair and going over it 4 times each, this was not from lack of direction.  The formula smells bad and you hope that once you wash it out that it will subside...nope, my fiance complained about the smell to me.  Lastly, I purchased this with the shampoo and condition so it would be long lasting.  It was not, I back to my frizzy hair after a week and I only washed my hair twice in between.  Huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> This stuff works just as good as the salon. No more $200 to calm my frizz. My only complaint is that it does take over an hour. But the end result is worth it.</li>
    <li> straightens the hair with 70% success, makes your hair easy to style, adds more shine to the hair, doesn&#x27;t change the hair color. little expensive for one use in comparison to keratin treatments. for best results use the bottle for one treatment if you have long hair!</li>
    <li> I have mixed race hair white /black. The process of this treatment was horrendous! It took me 5 hours. My hair is extremely curly and very long (almost touching my butt). After straightening it I went to bed without washing my hair. I washed it the following morning. It most definitely does what it says on the bottle. My hair isn&#x27;t straight but it&#x27;s a lot more manageable and softer. I&#x27;ll try this again next month to achieve an even softer look and feel</li>
    <li> works great on my daughters hair</li>
    <li> This product made my hard coarse, fizzy, and curly hair into shiny, soft, and manageable. I still have the curlers but it is very easy to flat iron. I was really hesitating of the long- time consummating process. But the fact that my hair is fine and medium length encouraged me.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair with regular shampoo then dried it up to more than %90 then applied the treatment. I have to say my hair was pretty drying when I reached some upper layers. But the strengthener itself was gentle on the hair ( I had experiences with products that would MELT our hair and make it PLASTIC LIKE) not this one! This coated the hair gently and had no smell to mention. I used only 1/3 third of the product and still have a lot to use for up to 4 times maybe. After about 15 minutes I was suppose to blow dry my hair then iron flat it but I skipped the blow drying and ironed my hair ( again did not want to pull my hair too much with the product on it). I noticed how shiny and easy to flat my hair was.  I washed my hair only with water then with my regular deep conditioner from Bed Head. The result was noticeable that my hair was so manageable and easy to flat ironed.This product provided me with shiny and soft hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is completely unruly. It&#x27;s a frizzy, gray haired (yet color processed) mess. This made my hair so smooth, shiny, soft and frizz free. It didn&#x27;t work as a straightener, which is ok, because it leaves the \\&quot;body\\&quot; in. It made drying and styling so much easier and quicker. There&#x27;s no \\&quot;down-time\\&quot; with this treatment either. Forget those expensive salon treatments and give this one a try... you&#x27;ll be VERY happy. It comes with a cleansing shampoo and the directions \\&quot;recommend\\&quot; using their brand of aftercare shampoo and conditioner.  However, I use the Keratin Complex shampoo and conditioner, which you can find at almost any drug store, and it works out just fine.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice now. My results for my Thick, Frizzy, Curly, Fly Away hair: Better than any salon treatment I&#x27;ve EVER had. Not kidding...Like..&amp;#34;..is this really my hair???&amp;#34; Love all the Liquid Keratin line of products...I will continue to use them forever. I recommend them highly.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair that gets very frizzy in humid temps...and I live in FL.  This product leaves my hair wavy--not straight--but prevents the frizz.  If I dry my hair straight, it stays straight.  I have used this Keratin several times with great results and other than it lasting 2 vs 3 months like a salon treatment, I see little difference other than price.  I have also found that doing this at night, sleeping in it and washing out the next day resulted in it lasting a little longer.  I didn&#x27;t find it difficult to do, and now that I have my neighbor hooked on it, we make a &amp;#34;girls night in&amp;#34; and do each other&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own Keartin treatments at home for a few years now. The last product that I used was extremely strong...the fumes were awful &amp; it left my hair too straight and lifeless. Plus it took me between 3-4 hours with all of the steps. Today, I did the Liquid Keratin 60. There were no fumes &amp; I finished in under two hours. My hair still has a bit of bounce to it. My blow dry time definitely was less &amp; hair is smoother. I also liked the consistency of the product.  The creamy type solution was easy to work with. Hoping the treatment lasts for at least 60 days. If so, this will be my new go to product!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are great but not so sure about the 60 day straightener ? My hair was not the best at all however Ive only recently started using the keratin products so maybe next time I may get a better result.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I thought this was going to be a bad product but decided to at least give it a try based on the reviews and the prices.  I had been using a much more expensive brand (that also took longer to do) for the last two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color-treated, extremely curly, thin hair which equals extremely frizzy.  With exception of keratin treatments, nothing would keep the frizziness away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am thrilled with the results.  The only issue I ran into was a bit of nervousness after the treatment.  My hair was not as shiny after that first wash. But after the second wash, I have the EXACT SAME results as the expensive treatment.  I just saved a ton of $$$ and am  going to keep using this product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product does take a while but you do get to wash it out the same day.  I did also find my hair stuck together a little more when I was trying to pull it apart for the straightening.  But it wasn&#x27;t tough or a turnoff at all, I just was more careful of separating and it worked out very well.  I love being able to wash out the same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I recently went to a water park and then over to the dry park and my hair did get a bit wavy but nice wavy.  My bangs stayed pretty straight so it looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this product for my keratin needs.</li>
    <li> It did what it promises, and I&#x27;m very happy with the products</li>
    <li> My hair:  frizzy, curly, wavy and always have to style it before I leave the house otherwise it&#x27;s a hot mess.  I have used many keratin treatments of varying strengths at home and at the salon.  My favorite ones are the ones that leave my hair straight after the first wash.  This one isn&#x27;t my favorite bc it didnt leave my hair straight, but it was shiny, smooth and less frizzy.  More of a controllable beach wave I have going on.  So it is good, not great.  The price, good, no formaldehyde or other aldehydes, good.  But didn&#x27;t straighten for me.  I will probably try it again in a month and see if it has additive effect.  If not, I&#x27;ll let this one go and try another one or go back to one that I have liked in the past.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel great the first day but wears off after 2 washes and also leaves white dandruff looking things in your hair</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product was a huge waste of my time. I followed instructions, spent a large portion of my afternoon washing, blow drying, applying the product, drying, flat ironing, waiting, washing, blow drying all to end up with a sticky, heavy, dull and weird smelling hair. I was&#x27;t expecting perfectly straight hair at all, but was hoping it maybe would&#x27;ve relaxed the tight wave I have but it did not. I think the intention of the product is to weigh the hair down maybe to help pull the wave? Either way, not the look, OR FEEL I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;I  just had hoped this would have been &amp;#34;THE&amp;#34; product I have been searching for.</li>
    <li> Not yet sure about this 60 day product...I have used the 30 day Keratin treatment AND the 30 day BOLD with good results. My curly frizzy hair is softer and smoother after using both  the 30 Day and 30 Day BOLD. So I ordered the 60 Day product and applied it just today. There is a difference in the application process, and the texture of the 60 day product is more like a cream, making my hair sticky. While applying the product the spray  bottle became difficult SO, I cut the plastic outer wrapper off the bottle and GUESS WHAT??? The bottle had 30 DAY BOLD KERATIN TREATMENT written on it!!! WTH??? Both the texture of the product and the application process are different than what I&#x27;ve used before, and I liked that there is no &amp;#34;down time&amp;#34;, i,e, no waiting for two days before you can wash your hair. But I felt that this was, well, fraudulent to market the 30 Day BOLD as the 60 Day treatment. PLUS it costs more! Sure, it&#x27;s less costly than a $200 salon treatment and maybe it works just as well, but to package the 30 Day  BOLD with a 60 Day label just seems dishonest. Surely the company should know that SOMEONE was going to cut off the plastic wrapper on the bottle and see a different label, right?? So I&#x27;m giving it three stars for now because I feel deceived and because I&#x27;m not sure this &amp;#34;60 Day&amp;#34; treatment is going to work any better. Will update this review as time will tell whether this &amp;#34;60 Day&amp;#34;treatment works any better or longer, but the most I&#x27;d give is 4 stars because of the packaging discrepancy.  Anyone else notice this?&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> at first leaves hair a little sticky ... a little hard, but when you wash &amp; dry it gets soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;my hair was very dry, so it was easy to notice the change.i love this product</li>
    <li> Purchased this product.  I was skeptical about this product, perhaps because I&#x27;m used to straighting product having that awful smell.  I received this product on a Friday, read the instruction and did the strand test.  On Sunday morning I could wait to get this process started, as the instruction stated that you would need about 2 hours for the process.  It was easy to apply.  I would say the only part that was a little difficult (for lack of a better word) was applying heat to damp hair, you blow dry your hair with the product still in your hair, let sit for 15 and flat iron your hair.  Difficult in that because you have to get as close to the root of your hair and the steam from the flat iron as you put it on your damp hair is a little uncomfortable, but It doesn&#x27;t burn.  Once you are done the next thing is to shampoo it out of your hair.  Since I have hair wirey somewhat kinky hair I blow dried and then flat ironed again.  This product left my hair silky and straight.  I absolutely love it.  I will be purchasing it again, for both me and my sister who saw the results of my hair and asked who did your hair, it looks so nice.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I do not use as suggested by the manufacturer; I mix it with my hydrating creme and any oil I have - almond, castor or argan oil - apply on my hair wet, and leave it overnight. My hair is much, much smoother and I can see that it has straightened my hair too. I do not use daily but when I did my hair looked amazing.</li>
    <li> Although this was a long and tedious process, I really didn&#x27;t mind because I anticipated great results.  After the treatment, my hair looked beautiful for 2 weeks.  After 2 weeks, however, my hair became drier and more unruly.  It was if the product had magically disappeared, never to return.  For me, the Liquid Keratin 60 Day Straighter should be changed to the Liquid Keratin 14 Day Straighter.  Too much work for too little results.  I definitely would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, just made my hair dry and with a lot of split ends.&lt;br /&gt;So i would not recommend it at all!&lt;br /&gt;And if you take off the plastic cover the actual bottle says 30 days!</li>
    <li> Excellent product - a little involved in the process, allow at least 2 hours but results are worth it.</li>
    <li> My hair - coarse-ish, curly/wavy/straight all in one. Humidity wins every time, no matter what I put on my hair. Either I let my hair air-dry with curling gel in it or I flat iron it - hair does not take curling by a wand very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the products instructions to the letter and even added a little extra solution to my hair since it is so difficult. I did not purchase the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; shampoo or conditioner for after - didn&#x27;t see the need. My hair definitely felt super smooth after I was done and for a few days after - after that it felt the same as before. I saw a small difference in my hair, as in when I air-dried it wasn&#x27;t as frizzy but was still frizzy. Again, this wore off after a few days and now it is just back to normal. My hair is difficult so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting a miracle but I think if I use it again it will get better and better - at least I hope so. So if you have to money to give it a shot, go for it but if your hair is difficult like mine don&#x27;t expect drastic results in the first use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Bought it for my girlfriend andshe loves it.</li>
    <li> Have used this several times I love it!!!! It works really well. Just be realistic with your expectations. If you have to wash your hair every day or every other day it will not last for the 60 days as stated but for the money it&#x27;s well worth it!!! the more you use it the better the results I have been using the Liquid keratin products for at least 5 years religiously and my hair and my daughters hair is just as healthy and silky as ever. If this is your first time using this product follow the directions completely. depending on your hair type and thickness your first application may not yield the results you are looking for (but your hair will be much easier to straighten) by the second application I would say in about 6 to 8 weeks (depending on your hair type!!!) you will notice a real difference in the length of time in the straightening process!!! The key is how well you blow dry your hair just jeep in mind the hair you have is the hair you have!!! this product will make the straightening process shorter and easier!!!! it will not eliminate your curls!!!! after you become more familiar with the product and the results, if you like you can start using your own shampoos and conditioners as long as they are free of any sulfates.</li>
    <li> Totally wish I found this product earlier, especially in the humid spring/summer season in Georgia.  My hair is natural, no dyes, no perms, I am of more than 2 races and my hair is fairly unpredictable except in the fact that it frizzes the second I wake up. The liquid keratin has worked amazing for me once I purchased a hotter flat iron. The first application I did I used my old flat iron that heats up to 410 degrees and it did not take well to my hair and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in texture. I then ordered a new flat iron that heats up to 450 and has a temp control where I can see what temp it is at exactly, I re-did the application and with my flat iron at around 430 the product took to my hair. I followed the instructions minus that since this was my second application I did not have the shampoo that was provided with the product. I used my regular shampoo which is the Organix Brazilian keratin sulfate free shampoo and followed the instructions. This time I noticed that my hairs natural curls were looser and my hair was super soft. Drying my hair I could notice that it was straighter than usual when just blow drying. I use my flat iron for my bangs mostly and touch ups at my crown of my head but other than that I really don&#x27;t spend much time straightening my hair like I used to. My hair is still super soft and very shiny I have gotten numerous compliments. since July when I started using this product I have actually been able to wear my hair down and not have to worry about the humidity so I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ! And just what i expected from the product !</li>
    <li> It does the job, is largely fail proof, and lasts a long time. Smells better than the salon version, too</li>
    <li> This is my third or fourth bottle of this stuff and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s affordable (great price, several treatments in one bottle).&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my hair much more manageable, straighter when flat ironed, but doesn&#x27;t remove the curl.&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps my hair in great condition, despite using the flat iron at high heat everyday. (seriously, even my stylist commented on it and asked what I was using)&lt;br /&gt;- Love that I can wash it out same day after being applied.&lt;br /&gt;- I have thick (3b) shoulder length hair and each bottle last me about three treatments, applying it liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely seems to last longer and be more effective after subsequent uses. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but a small price to pay. I have dark ash brown hair and I do need to redo my color after a treatment, because it does warm and lighten a bit and I really need my cool tones. It&#x27;s not extreme, but it is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, very puffy and frizzy biracial hair. Ordered the 60 day treatment for my hair. First, when it arrived it looked like the product had been used. The bottle did not feel completely full. Second, the label on the bottle was loose. When I peeled it the rest of the way off, I found a completely different product label underneath for the 30 day bold. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the company&#x27;s way of recycling or if they are being shady and relabeling the product. I I did a return request but was only given an address label and would have to pay for return shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally said screw it and decided to try the product. I&#x27;m very careful with my hair so I followed the directions provided in the box exactly so I wouldn&#x27;t destroy my hair. Other than a slight decrease in curl, I saw no real results and the results I did see were gone after two weeks and 4 washes.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a second time almost a month later because I have read some reviews claiming it worked better for them the second time but had even less luck this time. If anything it only managed to dry out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this and if you are considering purchasing this, I would suggest buying directly from the liquid keratin site.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair and I used to spend 200 dollars every four months at a salon to get it chemically straightened until 3 years ago they had outdated product and fried my hair and they tried to fix it by chemically straightening it again but made it worse I ended up with knots ( more like dreadlocks) that I had to cut out of my hair most came after each wash and I could not get a comb or brush through them so I cut them all out did not brush my hair in 3 years because I could not get a brush through it due to being ruined until I stumbled over this lovely product i have only used it once but my hair is healthier and I can brush it wet or dry and the curl does not get fuzzy without product and it does not take me the normal 3 hours to straighten it with my flat iron cut it down to an hour. I am expecting my next bottle to be here any day now and can not wait to see how it works after another use.</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely nothing. I followed directions carefully and nothing. However, there is one thing it does, it leaves an awful smell in your hair.</li>
    <li> Truthfully, my hair is pretty straight to begin with. It&#x27;s wavy enough that I have to straighten it, but I never would have called it &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;unmanageable.&amp;#34; I decided to try this because I have these baby hairs that stick up on the top of my head, and wanted to get rid of them. This product definitely helped. My hair is straight as it&#x27;s ever been, although I still have to flat iron every morning. It cuts my time in half though! I would recommend this to friends with my issue, but I wouldn&#x27;t know how it works on completely curly hair.</li>
    <li> It gets your hair as straight as a perm without the commitment,but you can always go back natural  if you like</li>
    <li> Easy application, nice results. Worth it. I have wavy hair and I want it straight and smooth, it took away the waves.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff on my hair about three times now and I&#x27;m really loving the results. I finally have hair that feels and looks great...the hair I always wanted, except I &#x27;m ready for longer hair. But this and God seems to be remedying this concern too. My hair has grown quite a bit since I started. Friends/family keep telling me I must be using weed grow or something on my hair. I started in Dec 2014. The first pic is the before. The 2nd pic was taken in January after the first time I used this product on my hair. My hair was about ear length and curlier then and the 3rd pic is how my hair currently looks. I know you can&#x27;t tell from the 3rd pic, but my hair is now at a length where it is touching my neck.</li>
    <li> This worked wonders to my hair. Made my hair frizzy-free and smooth. Its NOT a relaxer. Its suppose to get rid of the frizzys enough that you can straighten your hair with little to no trouble.  My hair is soft, smooth and just amazing. Will purchase again!  Easy to follow instructions.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I love every Liquid Keratin product I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve never loved my hair as much as I do since I started using their products!  This 60 day straightener takes a lot longer and requires several more steps than the 30 day, but it does exactly what it says it does and my hair has never been healthier!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to apply and gives the same results as a very expensive keratin treatment at the salon. Also the fumes are not as harsh as the Brazilian treatment so it is generally safer to do at home. It has made my life much easier!</li>
    <li> My hair is mixed race curly. this is my first time using this product. I&#x27;ve used formaldehyde keratin treatments for almost two years and this is the first time I notice a real difference in my hair with any other treatment. it is straight, silky, smooth, hydrated. I highlight my hair and this product didn&#x27;t change my hair color at all. great quality, great price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m troubled how this product received 4 stars. I have medium curly course hair with some frizz during the summer months.  I followed the instructions exactly; however this product did nothing but &amp;#34;warmed&amp;#34; my hair and left an &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell in after a few shampoos.  I wish I could return but I used more than half the product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great price and fast shipper</li>
    <li> Great as always. It&#x27;s better than the old ones that were used as a spray.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed by this product. I have extremely thick, curly, wavy/kinky &amp; frizzy Caucasian hair. I&#x27;ve had several Brazilian Blowouts in the past few years, and while I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work as well as those, I thought it would at least help a LITTLE bit. It would be nice to find an affordable, effective, and formaldehyde-free keratin treatment I can do at home to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the pre-treatment shampoo packet came sealed in a ziploc bag but still leaked out everywhere. Then, I followed the directions *to a tee* and it did NOTHING to benefit my hair. It looks exactly the same, if not frizzier, than before the treatment. Also, it should be mentioned that the &amp;#34;organic scent&amp;#34; produced by wetting your hair smells so sour that it&#x27;s nauseating - like vomit or vinegar and rotten onions. Alas, the search for a good at-home keratin treatment continues. :(</li>
    <li> I am so happy to be able to DYI keratin!!! Salon treatments are very expensive so this is marvelous. Just takes time but not any more time than going to the salon. Make sure to check out YouTube for some video demos to get a better feel for the entire process.  Here is one: https://youtu.be/s_SV30e9ags</li>
    <li> Like this one, you can wash immediately and if applied correctly produces the same results as the professional keratin treatment. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Did not work on my hair very hard to apply ....disappointed</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy to use. Mildly relaxes hair so that it&#x27;s more controllable and minimizes frizz. No harsh odors.</li>
    <li> Lasted for about 2 shampoos then my hair was back to normal. The first day it was great and second ok but beyond that not worth it.</li>
    <li> Leaves my course, wavy hair smooth for about 2 months. all I have to do is blow dry. No flat iron.</li>
    <li> I have just treated my medium/long EXTREMELY frizzy, unruly, curly-kinky, fine hair for the 3rd time with this product . . . WHERE HAS THIS STUFF BEEN ALL MY LIFE? I had great success the first time, but still had a lot of the uglies come back outside in the muggy Florida summer, but a quick couple of passes with my flatiron cured that, with much longer-lasting results than with any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. I used nowhere near a whole bottle and figured I had enough to do it again in 60 days. I was pleasantly surprised with how long the treatment lasted and repeated it about 60 days later. The results were better than the first time and I couldn&#x27;t wait to see what happened after a third treatment. I still had not used up the first bottle. Since I did use up the clarifying shampoo that came with the treatment, I had to use my own and used a high-quality keratin shampoo with seemingly no difference. I finally had to apply the treatment again after about 8 weeks because my hair had grown out so much that I started to develop sort of a halo under my otherwise straight and ultra shiny hair. I once again used the first bottle, but this time I disregarded the many warnings that I had read about not over saturating your hair and used the solution much more liberally. This time, the resilts have truly blown me away. My hair is perfectly managable, can be blow-dried with just using my fingers, or, if I use a brush to blow it out, it will be straight and sleek and will stay that way untill I wash it again. I don&#x27;t have to use a flatiron anymore, at all, ever. (except for aplying a treatment.) it is August in Florida, the worst heat/humidity time of the year, and I can go outside without my appearance going through a total transformation. I love this stuff and love the added benefit of how healthy this keratin protein has made my hair. Shower to out-the-door: 30-40 mins.</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed and it only lasted 2-3 days. I am a daily hair washer. I do not think that is the reason that this product did not last, however, because I use only sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I cut the plastic label off of the bottle and the bottle itself said that it was a 30 day treatment for dark hair only!! I have strawberry blonde hair so I was very concerned about using it. I was already hallway into the process though, so I did it anyway. I feel mislead by the seller that they would market this as a 60 day product when it is not. It did not darken my hair or have any adverse effects in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;The process took 4 hours start to finish, which would be okay if it lasted a while. But 4 hours and however much money I spent for 2-3 days of smooth hair? No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I wanted to mention is that I bought the sulfate free shampoo while I was waiting for this to come in the mail. I was so excited about it (I&#x27;m a nerd) that I used the shampoo the night before (without using any keratin). My hair was SO soft and smooth and non-frizzy. I couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference the shampoo alone made!! After I did the treatment, it got even softer, and then it was back to the way it was before with the shampoo alone. My point is, if you&#x27;re reading this and you&#x27;re on the fence about the keratin treatment, whether or not you do the keratin treatment, get yourself some sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, disappointed in this product, I would not buy again or recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing to my tight curls. A few days after, my hair looked exactly the same as it did before this treatment.</li>
    <li> The product seemed OK, didn&#x27;t do a great job at &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34;, but it relaxed my friz a bit and is more manageable - though a lot of effort for such small reward. I&#x27;ll try again and maybe I&#x27;ll see more result. Air drying my hair is more manageable and you don&#x27;t loose volume with this product which is good.</li>
    <li> Make sure you have enough time, about 3 hrs, to apply the product per the instructions. Although it required me to complete two cyles of washing, blow drying &amp; ironing my hair, it was worth it!  My hair looked and felt great once I was done. In fact the second time I blow dried my hair after applying the product, it took about half the time it normally does. Will DEFINITELY use this again!!!</li>
    <li> This product does work well - it leaves your hair soft and frizz-free.  It fades a little with each use, though (as can be expected), and only lasts for about a month and then the frizz is back.  Or that&#x27;s how it was for me, anyway.  Still a great product, but I need to re-apply more often than I expected.</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick curly hair that becomes a frizz-ball during the summer. This product was able to de-frizz my hair while still maintaining my spiral curls, which I was extremely happy with since I did not want to relax my hair. Also, it helped cut down the time it takes to straighten my hair (normally blow dry then flat iron). My hair is at its best if I use a finishing shine spray (CHI Shine Infusion is awesome!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)Took FOREVER to apply!! Wanted to give up half way&lt;br /&gt;2)Hair felt DISGUSTING when you apply and blow dry hair...flat ironing took some time too (7-9 strokes). Happy that I was able to wash my hair out right after :)&lt;br /&gt;3)For some reason, the pre-shampoo packet was leaking when I opened the box. Luckily it was in a ziplock bag so it didn&#x27;t make anything else sticky. Had to use my own shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;4)Makes your hair smell weird when washing. Not like a horrible chemical smell, but just odd. Make sure you have a good smelling conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it was definitely worth it and would recommend it. It&#x27;s been almost 60 days and my hair still feels smooth. I would&#x27;ve given 4 stars if the pre-shampoo packet was intact.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the result!</li>
    <li> My daughter has very thick, coarse hair to the point that it looked dry and damaged. I used this product on her and it looked great! I have to wait and see how long it lasts though. But for what it&#x27;s worth, it&#x27;s a great product overall.</li>
    <li> I bought this and BABYFACE pure protein on the same day, around 5 months ago. Have used each a few times (but not together..do one treatment of one each month). This is NOT 60 days, it kept my hair straight for maybe 3 days but after a week or showering back to wavy. I am white with fine hair, mild waves. I would NOT recommend this. I would highly recommend the BABYFACE product more than this. It is not a keratin treatment (collagen) but it DOES WORK WONDERS, just read the other peoples reviews of it. In the meantime, if anybody else knows of a good keratin treatment comment, I am still looking for one. THIS IS NOT A GOOD KERATIN PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: This is THE best keratin treatment and in my opinion far superior than salon treatments. So I finally did this for the second time a year later (after two professional treatments in between) and this definitely seems to last longer. I can tell after washing the treatment out how much loosened my kinky curly hair was. I also have not relaxed my hair in about a year and a half and was worried it wouldn&#x27;t come out as straight as I had almost 4 inches of natural hair. still worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this after coloring my hair with Sally&#x27;s Argan oil one and only hair color. It did make it slightly warmer and a hint lighter. Afterwards I used art naturals Argan oil shampoo (available on Amazon) and conditioned with Sally&#x27;s Ion Color seal conditioner pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great on my thick kinky curly resistant hair! If it works for me it will work for you! No strong smell, burning eyes or tons of steam from ironing! For $21 it&#x27;s worth a shot. I got desperate looking for something with no aldehydes what so ever since I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant (thier website does state safe for nursing women). I really needed something to make my hair more easier to blowdry. I relaxed my hair for many many years, recently the past few years I have done several professional treatments with 4hair power solution (for ethnic hair) with amazing results (I still relax every 6 months or so with my last being December and I tried texlax method by mixing with sweet almond oil) My stylist bought a bottle for me, I&#x27;ve had it professionally done and have done it myself. I also have tried the Sally&#x27;s ion 30 day (OK) and Keratin Research. The texture of my professional one gets all over the place, it&#x27;s time consuming to apply with a brush. This stuff is so easy to apply since it&#x27;s a creamy consistency so you can do it with your gloved hands! They actually are both applied the same way where you rinse it out the same day (hint to me it works as well as my professional and it&#x27;s convienent since you don&#x27;t have to do the 3 day no wash/no pony tail non sense)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing keratin treatments is time consuming, it takes patience. Here are the steps I applied on my thick shoulder/chin length hair which made it easier for me and will help others achieve the results I got;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Night before I pre washed with the packet and let air dry (to reduce heat damage) will reccomend definitely need to purchase this seperate especially since the bottle is about 2 treatments for my shoulder/chin length hair. longer hair needs more than one packet for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Applied as directed in about 8 sections, focusing on my hairline first. I was meeting some family for lunch so I ended up putting my hair in 9 twisted up sections with bobby pins. The 1st 20 min I used a conditioner cap. It stayed in my hair for about 3 hours. By this time I can already tell how it loosened my curl/kinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Blowdried as directed. It was easier since it was already sectioned out. I used a metal vented brush which I feel got my kinky roots straighter and more relaxed. Plus the heat from metal of the brush help to really seal the product. I did not use the concentrated nozzle as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Ironed as directed. For my course/resistant/curly kinks I used a babyliss flat iron at 435 degrees and 7 passes. I tried to focus on my roots and midshaft with less passes on my ends to prevent breakage. My ends are pretty straight anyways from relaxing/keratin over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. As directed waited 15 minutes or so before washing out. I rinsed well with lukewarm and washed with WEN six thirteen cleansing conditioner. This is really nourishing, plus I don&#x27;t want to take the chance of washing out all of the hardwork I just did. I left WEN 613 in for 10-15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. To give my hair a break I let it air dry and the next day barely wet it in the shower. Blow drying was a easier and faster.... much easier to do section by section which I prefer to do since this method gets it nice and straight. I used the ion keratin cream (Sally&#x27;s) and organix/OGX anti breakage keratin oil on my wet hair before blow drying. Flat iron only needed one pass, it was also easier and quicker to do. At the ends I used Aveda glossing straightner to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone gave me compliments on my hair today!!!! Hopefully this will last, even if it&#x27;s only a month it&#x27;s worth and compared to other reviews and pictures it looks like it smoothed kinks more over time. I will continue to use WEN in order to make sure it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barely broken ends and overall a more sleek look. More manageable hair and price is amazing! I&#x27;m happy with my purchase so far!ce this method gets it nice and straight.

    <li> I am half black/half puerto rican and have pretty crazy curly hair. My curls are inconsistent and kinda a frizzy mess most of the time so I wear my hair straight 99.7% of the time. I first heard about Keratin a few years ago and spent ~$200 to have the treatment done and it was great, until I went home and washed my hair a few days later and it was like nothing happened. After that experience I vowed to not pay a salon for the lengthy process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research online and found Liquid Keratin - the price tag wasn&#x27;t too expensive and it seemed easy enough. I have bleached blonde hair that is pretty healthy - some breakage around the ends but overall in good standing. I read the instructions with the pre-shampooing, followed by drying my hair and starting to apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working the product through my hair was like the other reviews, it was pretty sticky and had a funny smell but I took my time and was patient in doing a good job. After the product was applied, I waited approx. 20-30 mins and then washed my hair twice and conditioned really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instantly from the moment I started drying my hair I could feel the difference. My hair felt lighter, sleeker, nicer, and it was still wet and nothing styled. I then dried my hair just with a blow dryer tossing around my hair and moved on to flat ironing and styling. Once I was done flat-ironing my hair I was almost in tears by how AWESOME my hair felt!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in FL and it rains A LOT and is HUMID, reallllly humid. Walked outside the next day expecting to have a puff ball for hair since I had clean hair in the humidity and the exact opposite! Perfect hair all day, I would HIGHLY recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a straightener - it smoothes and helps with frizz and it&#x27;s everything I had hoped for ^_^</li>
    <li> Love this product! Similar to the reviews the process was long. I have very thick dark hair with light highlights. When placing the product in my hair I noticed no odor at all! After you blow dry 100% With the product in your hair; your hair feels thick from the product. I started the long task of flat ironing and my hair felt crunchy and kind of stiff. However, when I washed it out my hair felt like silk!! Blow drying took a fraction of the time and my hair was so soft! I then flat ironed it and curled it and the results are flowing hair that is so soft to touch. My highlights did not change color at all!&lt;br /&gt;I am a black woman that went natural after years of relaxers and with this gem I get better results than any chemical relaxer!</li>
    <li> Took away the frizz but did not really keep hair straight. Gives hair a nice texture but a lot of work for a little result.</li>
