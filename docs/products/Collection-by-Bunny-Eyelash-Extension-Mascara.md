<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well what a product! My eyelashes became 10000% bigger the second I opened the top! They literally stop traffic for which I now have a court order. But I look great, the only downside being that my lashes are so big now they weigh a ton so I need corrective back surgery to stop me tipping forward.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to put on fake lashes...so this product is perfect for me!  This product  was super easy to apply, did not irritate my eyes and my lashes looked full and long!  My husband even noticed....he said &amp;#34;your eye make-up looks great!  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I recently got this to try to find some new mascara that my daughter would like. She finally got to test it out the past few days and really likes it a lot. The color is a really pretty dark black and looks really good on her.&lt;br /&gt;The Eyelash Extension Mascara  is really easy to apply and it only took one time to get it to stay on all day until she washed her face. There was no skin irritation for her and it washes off very easily!!&lt;br /&gt;It made her eye lashes look very long and beautiful!!! Perfect for wearing every day or just to special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to see that that they take very good care of there products too. The mascara came in a very pretty case and holds it very well!!!&lt;br /&gt;She loves it and that is what really mattered to me:) I like making my daughter happy:)&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done. My review was based on my experience and my daughters. No one told me what to say. We really like it a lot!!</li>
    <li> Works well - better than Younique, but the smell is a little off-putting.  I appreciate the value of the product very much.</li>
    <li> I really love the case that this eyelash extension mascara comes in.I have only tried one other eyelash extension mascara before this brand and I am definitely liking this one so much better.It comes in a neat packaging and is very easy to apply.I like that it really does work and adds extension to my eyelashes without having to wear any falsies.My eyelashes are curly and pretty thick but I like to have length and this really helps give me that look that I am looking for.This is also buildable which I like and is very easy to apply the coats.I did notice I have to be careful how I apply because the fibers can get bunched up making your lashes look clumped.So I work pretty quickly when applying and with a light hand, I find that works best for me.I also noticed that I had to reapply throughout the day to touch it up but other than that it works pretty great.One coat makes my eyelashes look more natural with length which is great for an all natural look.So far it has not irritated my eyes yet, you do experience fall out with this not much at least for me it wasn&#x27;t but it was very easy to clean up.Other than that I am really liking this brand it definitely works.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided during a promotion for inspection purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Younique Fiber lashes as well as several different &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; products, and I have to say that I can tell no virtual difference in any of the products.  The dupes perform just as great as the Younique fiber lashes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was NOT blessed with super long, gorgeous killer lashes.  Nope, unfortunately for me, I was blessed with the &amp;#34;are u sure your wearing mascara&amp;#34; type lashes.  They just don&#x27;t &amp;#34;Pop&amp;#34; no matter what I do.  Well, that is until I found Fiber Lashes.  I am not a coordinated person, my mother had dreams of having a daughter who pranced around in cute little cheerleader outfits, but that dream was quickly crushed when she realized her daughter had the grace and coordination of a clown.  As an adult, it&#x27;s no better, so for myself, I cannot use those beautiful &amp;#34;Falsies&amp;#34; that all the gorgeous &amp;#34;Beauty YouTubers&amp;#34; can use and wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKFULLY, someone somewhere decided to create a product for those who don&#x27;t have a steady hand, and that product is &amp;#34;Fiber Lashes&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not even going to pretend to know what all is in this mascara that makes it give us not blessed with lashes, some length, but I just know it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Start: A quick &amp;#34;How-To&amp;#34; guide for those new to Fiber Lashes&lt;br /&gt;(You can either wear Fiber Lashes WITH or without your regular mascara- I choose not to)&lt;br /&gt;1) Apply the Transplanting Gel on ONE EYE (It&#x27;s best to do one full eye at a time so that it doesn&#x27;t dry)&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply the &amp;#34;Fibers&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;3) Seal the Fibers with another Coat of &amp;#34;Transplanting Gel&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how dramatic you want your lashes to be, you can repeat the steps for a more dramatic look.  OR wear with your mascara for an even more dramatic look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Discount Received in Exchange for Review</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it arrived quickly in an impressive case. It works well, the directions state to apply your favorite mascara first, so the first time that I used it that is exactly what I did. I quickly figured out that was a no. It is a two step process, a regular tip mascara and a fiber brush. It looks great on me but my complaint is that it dries by the end of the day and is a little flaky to touch at that point. I am pleased with the purchase and would buy again if I had a chance to get it on promo again.</li>
    <li> Long lush lashes within minutes.  Following the directions of using my own mascara then the 2 step process I notice a big difference the first time through.  After applying two coats my lashes were long and full, looking almost like fake eyelashes, but in a good way of not messing with the glues and lining them up.  I love the simplicity of using this.  However, if you are not use to it, it will make your eyelid feel heavy in the beginning.  Love it !!</li>
    <li> Great product! I plan to buy more to give as gifts!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first when I bought this, but there were so many good reviews, I decided to give it a try! OMG, I am SO glad I did. I cannot believe how well this works. I have medium length lashes, but there thin. This not only lengthens, but since I want thickening does that as well. Simply *amazing* product!</li>
    <li> Took me a bit to figure out which one to use first, I love how easy it goes on and makes my lashes look great.</li>
    <li> I have wanted this for sometime and finally got it! Im in love!</li>
    <li> Lashes like you&#x27;ve dreamed! Very easy to use!</li>
    <li> I love how this makes my eyelashes so long.  I have sensitivities to certain products but this worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, makes my lashes very full.</li>
    <li> I have never tried fiber mascara before. I can say that ot honestly does what it says it will do. I have short stubby eyelashes and after applying a few coats my eyelashes looked long amd full. I was really surprised. The only thing that I did not like was that towards the end of the night I noticed fiber spots underneath my eyes.  It wasnt to much but was noticeable to me. It may be that I need to work with it a few more times. It concerns me a little tyat the fibers might get into my eyes and cause irritation but I am liking my longer fuller lashes</li>
    <li> This is one of the best fiber mascara&#x27;s that I have tried.  Often times the fibers end up clumpy and very obvious looking, but that was not the case with this one!  The instructions say to use over your regular mascara, in addition I found it was best to let my normal mascara dry and then go back thru it with an eyelash comb to break it up a bit.  Then one application of the gel, one of the fibers, and finish up with one more coat of the gel and you have gorgeous lashes.  If I was going for a really dramatic looks I would do 2 coats of the fibers and that was plenty!  I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants longer, fuller lashes!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara!  Instantly added volume and dimension to my eyes.  Its easy to apply, works with any of your favorite make-up/mascara that you already use.  Very dramatic effect.  I was able to purchase this as part of a promotion but is definitely worth the investment.  Excellent beauty product!</li>
    <li> Leaves my lashes looking long and thick I get lots of compliments and it last all day!</li>
    <li> Bought it as gift for 17 yr old granddaughter and she loves it! Works very well!</li>
    <li> Great product- great service</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It works very well.  Big, beautiful lashes. I don&#x27;t like that the rubes aren&#x27;t labeled.  I have to open and check each time I use instead of just grab and go.  Would be 5 stars otherwise.</li>
    <li> Love the extra volume &amp; length I get with these lashes!</li>
    <li> I will defiantly be buying this again ! After trying just about every drug store mascara you can get I never was impressed with my results... Then I got this and even my husband noticed my lashes without any prompting from me ;)</li>
    <li> I have rather long eye lashes but they are rather thin. I wear mascara but let&#x27;s face it they don&#x27;t all work. I find they irritate my eyes after wearing it all day or it clumps. So I wanted to try this new fiber lashes through a promotional price to see if it works. Sure enough this is the easiest, light weight wearing lash product I have every tried. I have tried several too! I love how my lashes look without feeling heavy or clumpy looking. Easy to apply and lasts all day. Plus, the packaging is high end quality.</li>
    <li> This delivers a beautiful, rich fake lash look only if the mascara applied initially is not clumpy and has a brush applicator that separates the lashes well. Or, if you have an eyelash brush to separate the lashes. This is an important step because the gel + fibers + gel again &#x3D; a total clumpy mess if lashes aren&#x27;t straight and separated first!!</li>
    <li> I have super tiny lower lashes, and was surprised at how visible they were after applying this!  You could actually SEE my lower lashes, and they looked full!</li>
    <li> This mascara actually works! I have very thin eyelashes and I need to put a lot of mascara to make them look nice and thick. This mascara is a miracle. It transforms your eyelash from nice to magnificient in minutes. It is however not a quick process- first apply your own mascara and let it dry. Then you apply this transparent gel followed by the fiber. And the result is stunning. You will not go back to just applying your mascara ever. I love it. Sample received.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I purchased this after reading all of the good reviews. Honestly I am really disappointed in this product. The fibers irritate my eyes and leaves black fibers all over my face through out the day. (Which are difficult to get off your face)</li>
    <li> Have you heard of younique? Yeah, i cant use it, it actually breaks me out terribly when i do, so when i was offered this eyelaash extension mascara to test for my review, i was skeptical, but i gave it a shot! And boy am i glad i did. Not only did i have ragin eyelashes that were thicker and longer, but no breakout! Which was completely amazing. They made my eyelashes look great! The only downfall is, which i now know how to correct it, so im letting you in on this little secret, dont tell. Lol when you have applied the lash extwnsion, go ove it one more time with the glue, then wait for it to dry and then go over it with your REGULAR mascara and it will lock those fibers on there and you wont have random fibers all over your face like i did! This is truly a 5 star product and i will continue using and will be purchasing my next set soon!</li>
    <li> Very good but the fibers were everywhere by the end of the night. They definitely got the job done but I took a star because of the fibers.</li>
    <li> it works great and no smudge it works great with my blepharitis which makes my eyelashes fall out and doesn&#x27;t irritate them at all(:</li>
    <li> This is the best thing purchase any woman could ever make! My lashes were ruin from wearing false lashes. I could not believe my eyes when I used this product. I will never wear false lashes again! Love love love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Holy moly this is amazing! I was shocked at the volume !</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with a fiber lash mascara. I’ve been wanting a mascara that gives my more volume and length. I’ve tried tons of mascaras and haven’t been able to find the perfect one yet. I was excited to give this Collection by Bunny Eyelash Extension Mascara a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a gorgeous box that holds the Transplanting Gel and the Natural Fibers. Also included in the box is a card with instructions and company information. The instruction card says the business is located in OH but it doesn’t state where the product is actually made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I like to use an eyelash comb just to separate my lashes and make sure they are clean from any dirt or debris. Then I apply the Transplanting Gel, which is in the long tube. I move the brush from side to side and work my way towards the outer part of my eye lashes. Next I quickly apply the Natural Fibers before the gel dries. Depending on what look I am going for, sometimes I repeat these steps. If I just want to throw a little mascara on just to run to the store, I will only apply one coat. It does take a little practice. Like I said, this is my first experience with fiber lashes. I use facial cleansing towelettes and it easily removes the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging. It makes it great for traveling. However a fault in this product is the spelling on the tubes: Matural fibers and TraMsplanting gel. I capitalized the errors. The M’s should be N’s. Maybe this is just an error on some tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is a nice set. I love that it contains green tea. It’s dark black for a dramatic look. The set gives you long full lashes. I like that it’s good for sensitive eyes and safe for contact wearers. I have not experienced any problems with this set. I received this product for free to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I like the  mascara- it makes my lashes look longer and fuller. My only complaint is the fibers peel off and fall onto my cheeks, so I have to contantly be wiping them off my face. I will buy this type of mascara again, but I am going to search for a brand that doesn&#x27;t come off during the day.</li>
    <li> Not only a great product but the customer service is outstanding!  I actually have long defined lashes, even with one application. My go to everyday mascara. Bye bye Dior!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Makes my lashes fuller and longer.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It&#x27;s everything that I&#x27;ve been looking for and more. I&#x27;m 51 years old and my eyelashes have been slowly diminishing in length and quantity over the last 5 years or so. Until now, the only mascara I could find that works good enough was from Avon. I won&#x27;t be purchasing that product again. I&#x27;m not looking for mega lashes. I&#x27;m just want lashes. This product performed better than expected and I only put on one coat. That&#x27;s enough for me. It took me all of 2 minutes to do my lashes compared to my usual time of 6-8 minutes and multiple coats and the need to separate them. This is self separating if you put the gel on as you separate them with the brush. I received this product at a reduced price for testing, evaluation and review purposes but I&#x27;ve now found my forever mascara. I have no need to look any further and since it lasts 3 months its economical as well. The packaging is very luxurious. I love the case. You will too.</li>
    <li> I just want to start by saying that I have always been 100% against a certain brand that sells these and never had any desire to try them. You know the ones everyone calls &amp;#34;spider legs&amp;#34;. I always look at pictures and think that I would hate trying them. These absolutely change my mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These came packaged in a very sturdy case that has two loops to hold the tubes in place. The smaller bottle is labeled as &amp;#34;natural fibers&amp;#34; and the  bigger on as &amp;#34;transplant gel&amp;#34;. The transplant gel reminds me a lot of eyelash glue. It&#x27;s not tacky but more of a sticky mascara. The brush is a nice design that made it easy to get all of my lashes evenly coated. The fiber brush does not have bristles on it and surprisingly they weren&#x27;t loose and falling everywhere when I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions (very important!) and applied my favorite mascara. I then applied a layer of the transplant gel to my top lashes on both sides. It did not make my lashes start clumping but I could tell they were sticky and if you add too much it will get clumpy just as if it is regular mascara. While it was still wet I started to apply the fibers, the scariest part in my opinion.  Had no real strategy so I just swiped them on and they stuck without too much fallout or clumping. I then applied a second layer but only to the end of my lashes to prevent clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was fallout. That is inevitable and I&#x27;m sure has a lot to do with experience. It wasn&#x27;t horrible and I easily wiped them up with a Q-tip. I thankfully didn&#x27;t get them in my eye or at least I didn&#x27;t feel any which is why I was so worried about using this type of mascara. You can see in my picture that with the little that I did there was a pretty big difference. My lashes were longer and actually curled a little more. I will play around with this more to find the perfect technique and I know that it will become my go to piece.&lt;br /&gt;Sampled provided for honest experience.</li>
    <li> I had to change my review of this product. When I first got it, I did not like it at all, because the fibers kept getting into my eyes and it was quite irritating. You have to apply it very carefully only opening a little bit of your eyes so the fibers don&#x27;t get into them. The instructions for the applications weren&#x27;t very good. I had to get better instructions from reading the reviews. I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments for my eyelashes, but it&#x27;s also because my eyelashes have been growing after using this eyelash serum I got from Etsy: https://www.etsy.com/listing/119825198/organic-eyelash-conditioner-vegan?ga_order&#x3D;most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type&#x3D;all&amp;ga_view_type&#x3D;gallery&amp;ga_search_query&#x3D;eyelash%20serum&amp;ref&#x3D;sr_gallery_1</li>
    <li> It is wonderful, I love I left me very long eyelashes.😍</li>
    <li> They look ok, I think with more practice I might do a little better, I don&#x27;t feel it gives the same smooth look as false lashes, and therefore over priced.</li>
    <li> Ok overall I really loved just the mascara. I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the fiber one anymore though. I used it for a total of 3 days. The first day I had such bad eye irratation. The next two day were really bad. My eyes were super swollen, red and itchy. It was pretty miserable. I must be allergic to one of the ingredients. I ended up giving it to a friend who really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I really like just the mascara. but since having such a bad experience with the fiber one I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This eye liner has got to be my favorite it does what it says and it cones off super easiky!!love it!!</li>
    <li> I tried it on one eye two see the difference my self and you can see it I like how full it looks and it didn&#x27;t feel heavy on my eye lashes I have tried some and they felt like I was wearing way to much but this one doesn&#x27;t I can say that it doesn&#x27;t come with directions but its not hard to figure it out love the little black box it comes in I am very happy with this no mess and it does not run so that&#x27;s a good thing. I received this product at a lesser price for my review I will say that even though I paid less that is just another plus since the product actually was worth its regular price.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try fiber mascara for a while now, and am so glad I finally did.  I&#x27;ve bought almost all the expensive kinds out there trying to find a mascara that makes me have big dramatic lashes, but without the big clumps.  Dior, Benefit, Stila, Smashbox, Tarte, etc.  I&#x27;ve never liked any of them to buy more than once.  But this stuff is in a league all on its own. And while it seems a little more complicated with the two different tubes and steps you have to take, it really isn&#x27;t difficult to put it on.  I was worried about the fibers falling into my eyes throughout the day, but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all. And my lashes are huge!  I am loving this mascara and will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING! USE THE GEL BEFORE THE GREEN TEA, THAT WAY IT WONT BE &amp;#34;FLAKY&amp;#34;. BUT, I&#x27;VE ONLY USED THIS FOR A FEW DAYS IN THE MORNING, AND YOU CAN ALREADY SEE THAT MY EYE LASHES ARE THICKER! I APPLY THE GEL, GREEN TEA, THEN WAIT 5 MINUTES AND APPLY MY REGULAR MASCARA!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M IN MY &amp;#34;40&#x27;S&amp;#34;, AND MY LASHES SEEMED TO BE THINNING OUT QUITE A BIT FROM WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, BUT NOW I FEEL THAT THEY ARE &amp;#34;COMIMG BACK TO LIFE!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S A NICE CHANGE! IT ALSO COMES IN A LITTLE HARD CASE TOO!WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT!! THANKS!</li>
    <li> Check my other reviews and you will see I&#x27;m not a professional paid reviewer who hands out 5 stars. This product deserves a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10.  After waiting a few days to seek my ophthalmologists approval (I&#x27;ve had cataract surgery).  I came right home and tried this product.  It is awesome.  My lashes are sinfully long and full.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and from other reviews I assume easy to clean off later.  Since my sister is now begging to try it I&#x27;m placing another order.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Definitely works. I have a clumping issue, but I am chalking this up to user error at this point. A good mascara comb and some more attention could likely alleviate this problem. Item arrived promptly and without any issues.</li>
    <li> I loved the way the product looked when applied. Loved the color. Loved the fullness it provided.  I absolutely HATED the way the fibers fell on my face ALL DAY LONG. Every time I went to blink I could see the fibers fall from my top lashes. They fell into my eyes, into my contacts, on my cheeks, on my nose -- EVERYWHERE. I was constantly wiping my face and checking myself in the mirrors and in my phone screen. It was incredibly annoying. I can&#x27;t even count the times where I had people in the office tell me I had black specks all over my face.  The irritation it caused with my contacts was miserable. I ended up taking my contacts out because I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most mascaras.  Have to take them off as soon as I get home due to itch and irritation - not Bunny!!!  I actually leave it on and get a full two days wear out of one application.  I read thru the reviews and instructions and thought...&amp;#34;Oh, this probably won&#x27;t work and will go in the garbage, but I&#x27;ll give it a shot&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s simply AMAZING and I had no idea it would be so easy.  It takes less than a minute to put it on both eyes - I curl my lashes first and then once applied, I&#x27;m done.  It dries almost immediately.  There&#x27;s very little waste - only a few small fibers fall off and get thrown away.  On day two all I have to do is curl the lashes and I&#x27;m done - it wears that well.  You cannot, however, get it wet - it disintegrates off your lashes immediately - which is a plus - there&#x27;s no scrubbing to get it off your lashes when you want to.  Just don&#x27;t cry with it on or you&#x27;ll lose all the extension pieces...</li>
    <li> I did not  expected a lot from this product but I was very much  pleased. Not difficult to apply and does not flake during the day. Lashes look like fake but none of the work. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and actually works great. The mascara lasted through the gym. The seller was quick to fix an issue with my first shipment and offered great customer service. I would recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> Works great. The Gel seems to dry out fast...only had it for a few days.</li>
    <li> I have been tempted to buy the younique mascara for a while now, but I&#x27;m glad I bought this instead. To apply the product, you have to first apply a normal mascara. Then you apply a gel and then the fibers and then the gel again. I had to apply the fibers twice to get my desired length. I definitely did notice a difference in how long my lashes looked. My only issue is that I applied it to my bottom lashes and all day I was constantly rubbing away fallen mascara and fibers.</li>
    <li> Love this product, easy to use and now I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Too expensive for the results.  Flakes and leave goop below the eye.</li>
    <li> As others have said.  It&#x27;s a waste of $. L&#x27;oreal double extend lash extension works way better for 1/3 of the price of the Bunny brand.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific &#x27;find&#x27; - actually works for me!</li>
    <li> Wow, this really works.  My lashes get 3x longer when I put it on.  It is easy to apply and it is a noticeable difference when I wear it and do not.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! SO natural looking and SO EASY TO USE!!! My lashes look incredibly long and thick without look overdone or tacky!! You won&#x27;t be sorry you purchased this awesome mascara duo!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this extension mascara! It makes my lashes long, full and looks completely natural. It&#x27;s easy to apply: I start with a layer of waterproof mascara, then apply the gel mascara (in the large tube), then apply the fiber mascara (in the small tube), repeat the gel mascara, then finish with the fiber mascara again. It lasts all day, only needing a touch up if I go out for the evening. Even with the multiple steps, the mascaras seem to last quite awhile, making the price fairly reasonable. I&#x27;ve tried other extension mascaras, but this one is the best for me! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have short lashes and this is the best product that I have ever used...Anyone who knows me,  knows that I have have tried every product out there. ..wish I Would have been paid. ..lol. I will definitely purchase Collection by Bunny again!</li>
    <li> Bought this fah my boo and she luved it.</li>
    <li> Will only buy this brand from now on!</li>
    <li> I have heard of 3D fiber lashes as the newest beauty trend. I really wanted to try them, so when I was selected to review them during a promotion, I was thrilled! I was really impressed at the packaging. They come in what looks like an eyeglass case and inside are two formulas; the transplanting gel and the natural fibers. This was the easiest product I have ever used to make my lashes look longer! And it is the only one that actually worked!  All I did was put on a thin coat of my regular mascara, then a coat of the transplanting gel. As the gel was still wet, I applied the 3D fibers, which are exactly that, all natural fibers. Then to finish I just put on another coat of the transplanting gel to set the fibers. I could not believe how wonderfully long and beautiful my lashes were, and I only did my top lashes. You have got to try this stuff to believe how well it works!</li>
    <li> Great extension mascara! Works better than popular brands! This one is my new favorite. Super black. Makes lashes long and full. It is not goopy and does not give you spider lashes, the lashes seperated nicely. It stayed on well. With some of the others i have tried, some of the fibers fell off throughout the day, not this one. I am happy to recieve this awesome mascara to review. It looks absolutely fabulous!</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion.... I love to stay mascara on a daily basis.  I was really looking for a mascara that makes my dark brown eyes pop out.  This mascara mage that happen.  I got alot of complements on how my eyes looked so pretty.  I will definitely be purchasing more of this product.</li>
    <li> omg I love this. it makes my eyes look fantastic. it doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge. it doesn&#x27;t bleed down your eyes and make you look like a raccoon. I have very thin short lashes and this made my eyes look great and full. I will be buying this again and again.</li>
    <li> I have almost non existent lashes. So, I was excited to give this eyelash extension mascara. I had extremely good results with it. There are a few simple steps to achieving eyelash greatness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply your regulars mascara and let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply the transplanting gel and let it partially dry.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply the fibers and let fully dry.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply another coat of the transplanting gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fuller, more dramatic lashes repeat steps 2-4. I was extremely happy with just one round but you may want more drama. My only issue with this product is that some of the fibers flake off. This could be very uncomfortable for a contact lens wearer. All in all they are pretty darn good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* SAMPLE PROVIDED*</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money on the fake stuff. Get the real stuff and the new 3D now.&lt;br /&gt;(...)</li>
    <li> I really like the Bunny Eyelash Extension Mascara.  I just came off a hiatus of having eyelash extensions put on, so my own eyelashes were short!  I tried putting on false eyelashes and really didn&#x27;t like the look.  This is when I decided to order Bunny Eyelash Extension Mascara.  This product does help with making my eyelashes longer and fuller.  I don&#x27;t wear this EVERYDAY, but I have the option.  I just have to be more diligent and take the time to put on my BUNNY&#x27;S!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> use a hair dryer, it helps set everything</li>
    <li> HOLY COW! THIS IS AMAZING! I was worried this would look terrible and feel gross but it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than regular mascara. AND IT WORKS!! I followed the directions exactly: one coat of regular mascara, one coat of transplanting gel, add the natural fibers, then one more coat of transplanting gel. Nothing else. Bare minimum on each eye and the difference is astounding. I wish my phone took better close up pictures because its a HUGE difference. The eye that I used this on looks SO much prettier and the lashes look a lot longer than the eye with just my regular mascara. I did not apply any eyeliner or eyeshadow or anything to my eyes before I did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you are hoping for longer fuller looking lashes, GET THIS. I would call this downright glamorous. And I&#x27;m not a glamorous person! Haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a reduced cost to provide my honest and unbiased opinion, and I gave it. This kit is awesome. For real.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I have never used 3D mascara. I always thought it would be too much work. I am a mother of 3 and I can not spend an hour doing my make up everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it.  I opened the case and found step by step instructions.  I found the step by step instructions to be very helpful.  It made the process so easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me under 3 mins to apply!  The results were amazing! My lashes have never looked so long and full!  I have included pictures in my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first picture is with the mascara and the second picture is without!  You can see the difference. I also included a picture of the case and instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is simply amazing.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this so badly!!! The problem is my eyes were allergic to it. I followed&lt;br /&gt;the precise directions and wonderful video that the product makes very available.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so bummed... : (  The product is good concept!!!</li>
    <li> Lots of people noticed my eyelashes. I love the formula. It&#x27;s taking a little time for me to perfect my technique but the product is great and I know will only be better once I get the application down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, my eyelashes are so straight that I usually get serious racoon eyes by the end of the day. So far, no racoon eyes here.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything to grow my teeny tiny lashes and nothing works. I am so tired of fake lashes and don&#x27;t have the money to go get those implants. This is by far the best thing I have used! I actually have lashes and it doesn&#x27;t take half the effort as applying fake lashes and they look real. It is easy to apply and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my lashes flopping around, hanging half way off my face. I would advise taking the time to apply these on and make sure they are not flaking off onto your cheeks. I made the mistake thinking I can apply these carelessly only seeing them fall off, it was my fault for on taking sometime to ensure it was place on correctly and evenly. Other than that I love these and now I look like I have lashes.</li>
    <li> This is a little clumpier than other brands but it overall a good product!</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I got to try this out for a promotional deal. I have been wondering how these fiber eyelash Mascara works... NOW I know!! They work just as well as the more expensive brands. I was pleasantly surprised to find out today! I went and used this Mascara today and my husband asked me if I had done something different with my eyes? Why yes, I did. I put mascara on my eye lashes. YES!!! It was so nice to have big bold and lovely eyelashes. This product made my eyes pop! Thank you so much for being able to try this product. I am looking forward to using it over and over!</li>
    <li> I have decent lashes and have never needed to use eyelash extensions or a growth serum. Well, I was asked to try this Eyelash Extension Mascara from Bunny for a great deal just to share my honest opinion about it, I decided to give it a try. When it arrived I was impressed with the container! Then I opened it and saw 2 different mascara tubes and the directions. I followed what the directions said, which was to first apply my regular mascara. Then, after that&#x27;s dry, I apply a coat of the transplanting gel. Before the gel is dry, I apply a coat of the natural fibers followed by another coat of the transplanting gel. I decided that they were long enough and looked fabulous so that was all the fibers I needed. If you want them longer, the directions say to continue that process until satisfied. I definitely recommend this Eyelash Extension Mascara for anyone who wants to easily extend their lashes.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great. Works just like any 3D mascara would. If you&#x27;re not familiar with how 3D mascara works, make sure you read the instructions carefully. Don&#x27;t be alarmed that the shorter tube has dry fuzzies in it. That&#x27;s the green tea fiber and is used to give your lashes the 3D effect. The transplanting gel, which is the bigger tube works like any mascara, helping set the fibers. The amount of layers and steps will depend on how dramatic you want your lashes to look. I tend to use more layers at night before going out on the town. Less during the day. I use it every day because I have thin, short lashes. This helps make my eyes stand out more. Tip: use eyeliner on the base of your eyelid for an even more dramatic effect. I purchased this product at a promotional price to test. My review is based on my own experience and opinion of the product. Great alternative to fake lashes.</li>
    <li> This really works. My lashes are thin and this gives them a nice boost so I look like I have thick lashes</li>
    <li> Just so everyone knows this is a knock off of Youniques 3D Fiber Lash mascara which is cheaper, hypoallergenic, all natural with the fibers being made of green tea, and not tested on animals. Also has no clumping and conditions your eye lashes making them stronger. I highly doubt this does any of those things since it is a knock off. It&#x27;s made to look just like the Younique mascara but can&#x27;t compare at all! I am a Younique rep and hate seeing people buy crap like this if you want the real thing let me know I can hook you up :)</li>
    <li> I have lashes now! And my sensitive eyes don&#x27;t mind this mascara (unless it actually gets in my eyes, which only happens if I&#x27;m not careful when applying it). This is definitely the best mascara I&#x27;ve used.  First you brush on the &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; which is tinted with a black color, then you brush on the fibers, and then you brush on the glue again.  The instructions say to also use regular mascara but I don&#x27;t see the point of that.  This makes my lashes look so full.  The fibers don&#x27;t go on perfectly straight, so it can look a little bushy and slightly unnatural, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all - I&#x27;ll take as much lash as I can get!  This mascara stays put as well as or even better than other mascaras but yet I can wash it off with soap and water and don&#x27;t even need eye make-up remover, which is a big deal to me because I&#x27;m allergic to almost all of them.  I&#x27;ve worked out and sweated with this mascara and it has stayed in place.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing mascara , this product is a eyelash extension mascara .This is the best mascara for longer more dramatic eyelashes .Mascara set comes with natural mascara green tea fibers that increase your natural eyelashes by 300% .This two tube set includes mascara wands with transplanting gel and natural green tea fibers .Unlike regular mascara or false lashes, this  volumizing mascara has proven, proprietary ingredients to maximize your length and volume with no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fabulous mascara , you can have long beautiful eyelashes without fake ones.The process to achieve this is simple , first apply the gel and then the fibers and the gel again .It is that simple and you will have beautiful long lashes , you will be so impressed with this mascara .This type of mascara is all the rage right now , but not all are made as well as this one .This is also water proof , but it washes off easily with warm water .Be careful of the kind you buy read reviews to pick your best one, as you can see this is one of the best out there to use and this is one that has a great price also .So if you have already tried a product like this or are looking for one to try, you have found it with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this fantastic 3D mascara ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, it took a little bit and watching a video on how to best apply it. I would recommend this for longer and thicker eyelashes</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow!!! What an amazing product. You will NOT be disappointed</li>
    <li> Great Mascara! Does make lashes more vibrant!</li>
    <li> This is a good product only thing that  is wrong with it . Is the fiber brush gets into your eyes and make my eyes itch</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best fiber mascara I ever used, the fibers seemed to fall a lot easier than other products I&#x27;ve tried. I prefer my regular mascara over this, to be honest. Glad I only paid $1.00 for it, not worth the full price, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I really do not care for the time it takes to apply nor the finished product.  Great presentation and packaging though.  I am sure those with better skills than mine will love this product.</li>
    <li> It is the best...I will be a lifetime customer now! I have had eyelash extensions and also used the top of the line retail store mascara&#x27;s but nothing I have ever done works as well as this!! AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Very nice packaging!  I am giving this for Christmas and ordered one for myself (haven&#x27;t pulled it out yet) but after reading other reviews I know I will be pleased!</li>
    <li> I will not be without this ever again!  this stuff is magical!  I can&#x27;t believe the difference.  There is a bit of a learning curve to make it look right though.  I purchased this with a coupon but will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!! It works great!! My lashes look fabulous. I will surely buy again.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Not an everyday mascara for me, but nice for a night out</li>
    <li> This product is great. It works just as well as the other name brands you hear of all the time.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and my eyelashes have thinned over the years.  I have to say&lt;br /&gt;that this product really does enhance my eyelashes and they look 2-3 times as&lt;br /&gt;long as they really are.  I get compliments on how pretty my face looks all the time now.&lt;br /&gt;I wear contacts and the fibers really don&#x27;t get in my eyes and I can wear the mascara&lt;br /&gt;all day without a problem.  Best part, it comes off easily with soap and water and&lt;br /&gt;does not hurt my eyelashes.  I will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> The fibers flake off all daylong leaving you with black specks under your eyes. Goes on somewhat clumpy. A lengthening mascara works better for me.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  I have had it for awhile but today is the first time I have used it.  It was easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I was a little apprehensive about how it would look, but it looks really nice.  Great product!</li>
    <li> It instructs you to apply gel, apply fibers, and gel again.  I skip the third step, is I apply the gel again it gets clumpy.  Otherwise very nice long lashes.</li>
    <li> I did like the mascara but you have to put it on properly for it not to get in your eyes and do not sleep with it on overnight because it gets into your eyes and irritates them, very painful !!!</li>
    <li> This really works! I only use it if I go out. Makes my lashes look amazing! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but that was quickly remedied the first time I put it on! I have stubby eyelashes on one side and thin ones on the other this made both sides of my lashes appear full and long. It is easy to put on and only adds a few seconds to my morning makeup routine. Those few seconds are worth it because my eyes look refreshed and awake all day long!! It is amazing what a difference in my face by having the length and fullness provided by eyelash Extension Mascara by Bunny!</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOOVVVVEEEE !! Love love love love!!! It&#x27;s so perfect I love the way they make your eyelashes longer it&#x27;s amazing I will def. be buying another one of these!!</li>
    <li> I only use a little but it looks great makes my eyes look great</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it does make a difference to the length of your lashes, not as dramatic as false lashes, but gives your eyes a nice pop. I have used one other brand, but prefer this one.  It is easier to apply and also easier to take off. The other stuck to my lashes, so didn&#x27;t come off with eye make up remover; where as Collection Bunny feels more gentle as it comes off easily with remover.</li>
    <li> Love this! It&#x27;s surprisingly waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes! I do find small amounts of fibers, but they&#x27;re easily wiped away. My lashes look super long after only one layer is put on!</li>
    <li> I received this to give a honest opinion of,  I luv how easy this is to apply and made my eyelashes so much nicer and people noticed them better.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t need to use fake lashes because this mascara does trick. It&#x27;s easy to apply. It makes a huge difference in the look of my natural lashes. I&#x27;m very impressed .</li>
    <li> I was very unsure of this product because I have very sensitive eyes but I will admit I really liked the results. I didn&#x27;t do a bunch of coating so it was nothing super dramatic, but it did make my lashes look longer and thicker. I like a natural look and was happy that I could still achieve that. The reason I didn&#x27;t give all five stars was because I did have some fibers get into my eye, but I believe I can avoid that with more practice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d always wanted to try one of these fiber mascaras and am glad I finally did. I will say that I was prepared for what many who have never used these fiber mascaras are not. It is said that you must add a coat of your own mascara first, then the gel (which looks an awful lot like black mascara), then the fibers (which is a wand full of black cotton like material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are extremely short so I was not expecting a miracle cure. I have seen this product work wonders on those who have medium to long lashes because it accentuates them. Mine, not so much. It, of course, made them darker and added a bit of length, but that can also be achieved when layers of mascara are applied a certain way to the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even still, the product went on without irritation and I have no issues with fibers falling off my lashes and into my eyes. For that alone I am going to give this product several more tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product sent for purpose of review</li>
    <li> Great product.  Nice packaging, works as described.</li>
    <li> Burned my eyes, not worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product it really extended my eye lashes.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:c0c7774fc4c4c4f221b83cc0610f1345]]Way better then paying hundreds monthly for Latisse or eyelash extensions! My friend was telling me about lash fiber mascara &amp; I doubted it worked but it wasn&#x27;t too expensive so I gave it a try &amp; for once omething that sounded like it was too good to be true wasn&#x27;t. Its made of of little fibers that look like little hairs &amp; they stick to the ends of your lashes &amp; makes them look longer &amp; fuller. They were a lot fuller &amp; way longer as you can see in the video. You do have to be careful applying so your lashes dont get tangled but if you put mascara on first &amp; let it dry completely before applying this then it works easily because the mascara keeps your lashes in place. Check it out ladies its awesome!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do!! I love big dramatic eyes and this can be obtained using Collection by Bunny Eyelash Extension Mascara. I&#x27;m the kind of girl that won&#x27;t leave home without eyes, mascara and eyeliner. I&#x27;ve tried just about every mascara on the market to include the different fiber extension brands. I eventually got into lash extensions and became addicted to them as a means of having long dramatic eyelashes. After repeated applications of the glues and lashes, I was left without any real lashes of my own. I spent months regrowing my lashes. Once they grew back I declared to never compromise them again with extensions. Again I searched for mascaras and was introduced to Collection by Bunny mascara through my cousin. This product really does thicken and extend lashes like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Your lashes appear to grow right before your eyes. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. I recommend this mascara to anyone looking for bold, dramatic, sexy eyes with no clumps and easy take-off.</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s a better price than a direct buy brand and works just the same if not better. Love having long full lashes even though I already do I like to play them up and make them be dramatic. Easy to use too!</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipping. Well worth it.  Works great, looks great.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is pretty amazing.  I received it yesterday and soon afterwards, I completely cleansed my face and eyes of all makeup.  I applied as per the directions -- much easier than you might think.  You see the length and thickness immediately -- like maybe twice the natural lashes.  After a short time of admiring myself, I set about to clean out several closets, did laundry, perspired a lot. The lashes remained full and set!  Removal was easy with my normal makeup remover disposable cloth.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan, and especially the price...not worth it!  I thought I was really going to like it when I first put it on, but then it started flaking into my eyes throughout the day and really irritated them.</li>
    <li> Great product. It really adds lashes to your eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara goes on smoothly and does extend lashes without looking fake.</li>
    <li> FABULOUS! I suffer from chronic &amp;#34;lash envy&amp;#34; ,,,,,I am always ining for others lashes  This product makes my lashes so full and so long that I could not be happier! I love it and will order it again and again.....</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible.  It flaks  off all day into your eyes, burns &amp; stings. My lashes didn&#x27;t look any longer either</li>
    <li> I have skimpy lashes that don&#x27;t curl. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of mascaras and even gave false lashes a try once or twice. None of them did as good a job or felt as natural as this stuff. There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve but the effect is worth it. I will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the drugstore mascara I buy (like CoverGirl or similar). I was surprised upon first reading the directions that you are meant to use it with your regular mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I forged ahead. The directions leave a lot to be desired. It is a tiny one sheet page. It tells you which to use first- but neither bottle is marked. So you have to make a guess which is which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the results very dramatic and as promised. However, you need to make sure to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; through your eyelashes after first using it because some will be loose and can irritate your eyes. Even after shaking off the loose ones, I got some in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue I have had with this is it really makes your eyelashes super clumpy and if you look closely, you can easily see the fibers. So while this mascara will look good in pictures- it&#x27;s not something you want to wear on a date or to the office where people will be close by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, this will probably be something I keep around for an occasional use but I would not use it daily.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!  Made my lashes fuller and longer with ease.  long lasting and easy to use.  Come in a beautiful case!  will be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed with this magic mascara! My eyelashes are already pretty long but this product almost makes them look like falsies! I&#x27;d recommend this product to anybody that loves to try different products for the eyes &amp; this takes the number one spot! This will be the only mascara I buy from now on❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> I was surprised! Many products boast they can do something and they do not! This product not only filled in my lashes it also extended them.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love how my eyelashes look when I use it, not clumpy at all!  The only negative was that I had to figure out which item was which as they have no markings on either to tell what they are.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this mascara, the youtube video was definitely helpful and I will never ever go back to buying middle of the line mascaras that claim to lengthen again! My eyelashes look longer fuller and thicker without much effort at all!</li>
    <li> this is a must have in your make up bag if you are one with barely any eye lashes or one with light eyelashes. I am so happy i was able to try this. It is not a fake lash but more an all natural green tea fiber that you apply over a gel and it makes your lashes fuller longer and darker. it is simple to use.( I am not to good at makeup) but found this easy. One coat of gel one coat of fibers and then a top coat of gel. I have a new favorite mascara. will definitely be purchasing again. it stays in place all dy but yet is easily removed when you want to take it off. My sensitive skin was okay with this product as well. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get a handle on how to apply this but I am still trying to. I always get the fibers in my eyes and the lashes always look gross and super clumpy. I don&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;Wow, are those falsies?&amp;#34; look but this just looks like garbage on me. I absolutely just prefer regular mascara but I&#x27;ll keep trying with this to see if I can achieve a decent look and will update review accordingly. Also Youtubed how to apply and that didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
    <li> Love it!! My favorite yet!! Quick to ship!! Love love love!!! Ordering again!!</li>
    <li> Will not buy this product again.Flaky.All day I was wiping under my eyes...not satisfiec.</li>
    <li> Love it!! It does what it says... my lashes look like I want them too &#x3D;) very happy.</li>
    <li> I had waited awhile after receiving the eyelash extension mascara because I thought it would be a time consuming process.  It turned out not to be that bad and it made my lashes look longer and full.  However, when I looked in the mirror a little while later I had the little black fibers all over my face.  I will be trying it again to make sure I used enough gel and applied perfectly according to the instructions - I will revise my review if needed.  But if it happens again with the black fibers all over my face I will definitely never purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I used to have lovely long lashes and as I&#x27;ve aged, my lashes have changed like the rest of my body - They&#x27;ve thinned out and are much shorter.  I tried eyelash extensions for a while until I had an allergic reaction to the glue.  Then I started using a makeup artist trick where you powder your lashes.  It was hit or miss.  I thought I was going to be destined to short stubby eyelashes for the rest of my life.  Decided to try this product and have used it twice so far.  Wow, my lashes look amazing!  Recommend it to anyone who wants a natural longer fuller look.  It did not clump like a lot of mascara&#x27;s do when I use them, there was no smudging during the day and it was easy to get off with face cleanser. The only downside for me is that neither one of the tubes is labeled so it took more time to figure out which one was the gel and which was the fiber filaments.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a great product. I use it without coating my lashes with mascara first. That seems to help the fibers from clumping too much. This product does wonders for volume and length. I didn&#x27;t notice any of the fibers ending up on my face. I really wiggle the fiber brush starting at the base and up to the tip of the lashes while applying. This helps with getting even application. My only complaint would be the cost but I could easily spend that much in false lashes over the course of a couple of months and this is much easier to apply. The duo comes off easily with soap and water or makeup removing towelettes. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  It really lengthens my eyelashes. Will definitely purchase again.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I think this is a pretty great product I love how long it made my eye lashes.  It was like putting on fake lashed but without the hassle.  I like how easy it is to put on. It is a 3 step process as they recommend you put on your regular mascara first then apply this on.  It goes on very smooth and I did not feel like it was goopy on my eye lashes.  I would say that the mascara is light as I did not really feel it on my lashes.  I did not feel like I had to put on a lot of coats just to get my desired length.  One negative that I would say is that throughout the day small amounts of the fibers fell off and you could see it under my eye.  I had to wipe them away from time to time.  By the end of the day it looked like I had regular mascara on.  So I would say you probably have to reapply if you want the extended eye lashes all day.  I am very happy that I was able to own this product at a promotional price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.  I will continue to use this product as I do like it and I would recommend to those who want longer lashes and do not mind reapplying to keep the looks all day.  I provided a picture so you can see the difference with and without the mascara on my lashes.  The left side has the mascara on, the other side is natural.</li>
    <li> It arrived before it was supposed to. The packaging is fancy.I am NOT disappointed with this mascara. It is still the best I&#x27;ve used in at least 10 years! Not even the last mascara I bought by D&amp;G claimed to be the best can beat this one. The little fibers do visibly elongate the eyelashes but fall a little so you better look in the mirror every now and then to prevent little &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; on your face.</li>
    <li> It is ok, does make the eyelashes appear longer, but the fibers do not adhere to your own lashes. Fibers all over my face...tried 3 times...never again!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with my Collection by Bunny Mascara. It comes in a very stylish and durable case. Inside you have 2 containers . You apply your regular mascara first, then the fiber lash formula, and then top it off with their mascara wand. I took a picture of myself with it applied to one eye and not to the other. You see a very distinct difference. It is not at all messy or goopy. My eyelashes did not clump up. I also had no running or smearing after a days wear. I am never going back to my plain old mascara again.</li>
    <li> I have thin, undefined eyelashes, so I was excited to get a discount code to try this product.  I have heard about this type of product for some time but was skeptical about the actual results, especially when the price is double (or more) the price of a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mascara.&lt;br /&gt;From the first time I used this mascara, I was in love.  When you follow the directions, it is really easy to use.  Just be careful with the fiber as it is loose and can drop.  My lashes were so long and full, it almost looked like I had on fake eyelashes.  Except they were totally natural and my own!  I&#x27;m excited to finally look like I have eyes thanks to this mascara. Even though it stays put for most of the day and is essentially water proof, it is easy to get off with eye make up remover or a gentle cloth and water.&lt;br /&gt;As an added perk, this set comes in a sleek and nicely sized case that will easily fit into your purse or a larger make up bag.  I like that the pieces can easily be stored together so you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing one of the pieces.&lt;br /&gt;An awesome product that I&#x27;m excited to be using.</li>
    <li> This works well, but is too involved for everyday application IMO.</li>
    <li> Wow.  I can&#x27;t believe how awesome this stuff is!  I purchased this mascara/eyelash extender kit because I have light colored short sparse lashes and these transformed my eyes.  I wear light make up and a little mascara to work everyday.  When I got this kit in the mail I decided to try it on a work day. I wore my normal amount of make up with the addition of the eyelash product.  I got 2 comments immediately.  First was &amp;#34;wow you are glowing today!&amp;#34;  Second was &amp;#34;you look beautiful with make up&amp;#34;.  I literally had a crowd of women surrounding me asking where I purchased this and wanting the link to this product.  I am very impressed that coworkers noticed the difference in my eyes even wearing my glasses.  I prefer a more natural look and these extensions do not look fake at all.  You could tell I was wearing mascara but the lashes look authentic. I purchased this product during a promotion try and share my experience. I will definitely be purchasing this product again.  The results are amazing.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty neat. It works exactly how it is supposed to, creating long, extension-like eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two drawbacks. One, it tends to get clumpy, and two, when you wash it off, it gets everywhere. Neither would deter me from wearing it though.</li>
    <li> Product flakes too much and I end up with little black fibers in my eyes and on my face.</li>
    <li> I got this as part of a promotion, but I really love this and will definitely purchase again. The product does not smell weird like many cosmetics I have tried or used and the color is much richer than I had anticipated; not really darker, just a deeper, more complex color than the black black I had thought it would be. I like that the ingredients are natural and also that the results are absolutely stunning (seriously, this stuff looked amazing!), but what I really, really love about it is that it does not irritate my eyes or skin in any way unlike many other brands of eye cosmetics. I tried a similar product a couple of years ago and, while I enjoyed the results, it smelled weird and chemically and irritated my eyes for a couple of days after I had used it so I ended up throwing it away.  The only improvement I can see for this product overall would be to sell the mascara a fibers separate from the case for repeat buyers as cosmetics are wasteful in packaging already and not being forced to get more things that I would have to throw away would be an amazingly HUGE plus for me to any product like this. The stylish case is another bonus in my book; it&#x27;s hard like a glasses case and has a decent heft that feels great in the hand. I enjoy how recognizable the case is among my other cosmetics on the shelf or in my bag; makes it super easy to identify. The only improvement I can see to the case would be to include a small mirror, but that would make the cost go up and many cosmetics already come with similar mirrors inside their cases/packages.</li>
    <li> I like this, but wish the brush was a little longer. Other than that I like this mascara.  My lasges can look longer and thicker without looking clumpy or sticky</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my lashes look amazing!  Thank you so much for the high quality product!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it out and see how it compares to other brands.</li>
    <li> I am a mascara addict and love this mascara.  It makes my lashes look much fuller!</li>
    <li> Great mascara!! Love it! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered it at a great price. I figured you get what you pay for. Well that is not the case for this mascara. It works great, not clumpy and gives you pretty lush lashes. The case it comes in is cute too! I will be ordering more when I run out!</li>
    <li> This is a neat product. My eyelashes looked longer than they do with just plain mascara.</li>
    <li> The mascara is nice, if not a little goopy.  Package needs more instructions.  I am not stupid, but not a big make-up users.  I find the &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; to scatter while applying and notice only a slight increase in appearance.  I am totally in the majority.  Everyone around me loves this stuff and swears by it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Nothing lifts my mood than feeling pretty and this mascara is definitely it!</li>
    <li> This mascara truly works. Lashes look fuller &amp; if you are patient ans repeat the steps several times you can definitely get the longer &amp;#34;fake lashes&amp;#34; look. Had bought several times already, would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> This works great and I have received a lot of compliments about my eyelashes since using it.</li>
    <li> I am a complete mascara junkie. I have probably 7 tubes I rotate through constantly. I was super excited to receive this item for review as I have always wanted to try one of these fiber mascaras. Now this fiber mascara does have some getting used to. If applied improperly the fibers will get everywhere and clump your lashes together like nobodies business. You want to be careful and take your time. For my lashes, I can only use this for a special occasion where I want my lashes reaching for the sky. I have naturally long lashes already and the fibers in this mascara adds a lot of length. This mascara would be PERFECT for someone with thin and shorter lashes as the volume and length truly is great. For someone like me, whose lashes already touch their brows with regular mascara on, this may be too much. I didn&#x27;t get any irritation and none of the fibers fell into my eyes or on the rest of my face. I love that it&#x27;s sweat and waterproof too which is a plus. I really don&#x27;t have complaints about the fiber mascara itself. It is a great product when used correctly and really does add a lot of volume and length. Just didn&#x27;t work for my lashes as they&#x27;re already pretty long. Also, GREAT customer service from this company. Very friendly and a pleasure to do business with.</li>
