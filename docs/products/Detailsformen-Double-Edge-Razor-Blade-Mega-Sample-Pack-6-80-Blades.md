      <li>Good blades for a good price!</li>
      <li>This set allows you to figure out very quickly through comparison which are the best blades.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;- 5 Astra Superior Platinum&lt;br</li>
      <li>I discovered this and love the variety!</li>
      <li>i use the brushless kind, from bath junkie.</li>
      <li>Has a nice variety.  </li>
      <li>This pack is a perfect sampler for those new to DE shaving.  </li>
      <li>This has offered me the opportunity to get many razors at a good price but also to try so many brands and determine which i like.</li>
      <li>so I wanted to try more without buying a bunch of one blade and not liking it.</li>
      <li>Your experience may differ greatly - many variables are at play here, so trying them for yourself would make the most sense.  </li>
      <li>have not used many blades yet and there are lots of options.</li>
      <li>Went back to the multi blade and Dorco is the best budget buy.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good selection of blades.</li>
      <li>my pack came with \\&quot;Astra Superior Stainless 5 pack\\&quot; instead of the \\&quot;Dorco ST300 Platinum 10 pack,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Read the retailers fine print.</li>
      <li>that makes a huge difference too.</li>
      <li>There are huge differences,</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>Solid assortment of razors at a good price.</li>
      <li>Merkur Super Platinum&lt;br</li>
      <li>followed by a group of what I thought were very respectable blades that were similar in performance.  </li>
      <li>As you&#x27;ve probably read elsewhere, your face being different from mine, maybe you don&#x27;t agree with my opinions, but this set lets you figure it out on your own.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>by the way, you&#x27;ll need to get a good shaving cream, the regular gillette or edge does not compare with a real shaving cream.</li>
      <li>The Merkur ones are my favorite so far.  </li>
      <li>This multi-pack includes 9 different brands of blades by several manufacturers and is a perfect way to compare blade quality without investing too much in a singular brand.  </li>
      <li>In the meantime I would have to rate the opportunity as a purchase well worth while.</li>
      <li>Shark Super Stainless Blades&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was not as interested in.</li>
      <li>Of course these were part of why I was interested in the deal.</li>
      <li>These brands get frequent mention as high-performance blades, and I believed they were readily available.</li>
      <li>The Personna, Astra, and Feather were why I was interested in the deal and NO Personna or Astra to be found.</li>
      <li>Not only helps you find the best blade for your face and razor, but gives you an idea of blades you might want to try in the future if you switch to a different razor, and which blades you never want to try again for lack of quality.</li>
      <li>Since I sport a full beard from Labor Day to Easter, it&#x27;ll be a slow extended period before a fair assessment can be made on these blades.</li>
      <li>I bought it to see which one I would buy next time, but I enjoy switching them up so much would consider buying a sample pack again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- 5 Kai Stainless Steel&lt;br</li>
      <li>Using this to decide which blades I really like before ordering.</li>
      <li>real reason we are here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to trying the Feather and Personna.  </li>
      <li>burning skin, cuts, stubble, even on the first shave with a new blade, but other blades, they are smooth and last for many shaves.  </li>
      <li>certain major shaving website, of certain noble \\&quot;royalty\\&quot; has a set with guaranteed of 50 individual blades, all for only $24:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a very helpful necessity for someone new to DE shaving.   </li>
      <li>The DE shaving experience can change materially depending on how well the blade used matches up to your particular hair type/skin sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>so here&#x27;s my list of the best: feather light, merkur, wilkinson, astra, and dorco, and the bad ones: bic, derby, 7am and sharp.  </li>
      <li>In order to fully appreciate the greatness of the upper echelon of the razors, I believe it&#x27;s important to get a feel for the lesser brands as well.  </li>
      <li>I wanted the personnas and naturally,  they were not included..</li>
      <li>I got try out many of brands of DE razors for very little money if I had bought each brand one by one!</li>
      <li>I was expecting high quality good brand blades as per the description but almost half of them are not good brands like 7am that I&#x27;m not even planning to use.</li>
      <li>I am new to the double edge razor, so i needed some razors beyond my basics from the shave shop.  </li>
      <li>It was shipped fast, plenty of options, and included some samples such as pre-shaving oil, hand balm and facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>I would assume that at least one of the brands would fit the majority of users hair/skin type.  </li>
      <li>I have coarse hair and extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Then there&#x27;s the other two brands that yielded a less than adequate experience.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great sampler pack with Feather, Derby, Astra and others to compare and decide which works best for me.</li>
    <li> Retailer substituted two types of blades. Of course these were part of why I was interested in the deal. The Personna, Astra, and Feather were why I was interested in the deal and NO Personna or Astra to be found. Read the retailers fine print. They could switch the order on you!</li>
    <li> Since I have about 80 blades to go thru it will be awhile to actually give a review justice.    In the meantime I would have to rate the opportunity as a purchase well worth while.</li>
    <li> I just changed from years of shaving with the disposable blades to this double edge blade method.  This set allows you to figure out very quickly through comparison which are the best blades.  There are huge differences, not all blades are alike.  some of them, i could tell from just one shave that the blade was inferior: burning skin, cuts, stubble, even on the first shave with a new blade, but other blades, they are smooth and last for many shaves.  so here&#x27;s my list of the best: feather light, merkur, wilkinson, astra, and dorco, and the bad ones: bic, derby, 7am and sharp.  there&#x27;s still a couple of brands i&#x27;ve not tried yet.  As you&#x27;ve probably read elsewhere, your face being different from mine, maybe you don&#x27;t agree with my opinions, but this set lets you figure it out on your own.  by the way, you&#x27;ll need to get a good shaving cream, the regular gillette or edge does not compare with a real shaving cream. i use the brushless kind, from bath junkie. that makes a huge difference too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried Shark and Gillette blue blades so I wanted to try more without buying a bunch of one blade and not liking it. I discovered this and love the variety! It was shipped fast, plenty of options, and included some samples such as pre-shaving oil, hand balm and facial cleanser. Good blades for a good price!</li>
    <li> have not used many blades yet and there are lots of options. Using this to decide which blades I really like before ordering. If I find the perfect blade I will make note and order a bunch.</li>
    <li> Great mix of blades. Allows me to try all kinds of blades from around the world and rotate them. I bought it to see which one I would buy next time, but I enjoy switching them up so much would consider buying a sample pack again.</li>
    <li> Great sampler pack...a very helpful necessity for someone new to DE shaving.   Not only helps you find the best blade for your face and razor, but gives you an idea of blades you might want to try in the future if you switch to a different razor, and which blades you never want to try again for lack of quality.</li>
    <li> This pack is a perfect sampler for those new to DE shaving.

This multi-pack includes 9 different brands of blades by several manufacturers and is a perfect way to compare blade quality without investing too much in a singular brand.

I have coarse hair and extremely sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t take me long to find several brands that worked for me (Feather, Merkur), and at these prices ($0.12-$0.73/ea)the decision to leave cartridge shaving is continuously reinforced.</li>
    <li> Solid assortment of razors at a good price. It&#x27;ll take a while to get through them all, so take notes</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good selection of blades. All of the big names like Merkur, Feather, Derby, and Wilkinson Sword are included. Plus a few that I&#x27;ve never heard of like Dorco and 7am. All in all a great way to test out a bunch of blades without having to buy 100 at a time. One small nit - my pack came with \\&quot;Astra Superior Stainless 5 pack\\&quot; instead of the \\&quot;Dorco ST300 Platinum 10 pack,\\&quot; so I only ended up with 70 blades instead of 75. No big deal though.</li>
    <li> Product details state \\&quot;$32.00 Value\\&quot;, yet it costs $35.99 before shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A certain major shaving website, of certain noble \\&quot;royalty\\&quot; has a set with guaranteed of 50 individual blades, all for only $24:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Lord Platinum Class&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Kai Stainless Steel&lt;br /&gt;- 10 Feather Hi-Stainless&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Derby Extra&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Astra Superior Platinum&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Shark Super Stainless Blades&lt;br /&gt;- 10 Merkur Super Platinum&lt;br /&gt;- 5 Wilkinson Sword Classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone waste their money with FGP?</li>
    <li> I was expecting high quality good brand blades as per the description but almost half of them are not good brands like 7am that I&#x27;m not even planning to use. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I got try out many of brands of DE razors for very little money if I had bought each brand one by one! I found which one worked for me and it was worht the money</li>
    <li> I am new to the double edge razor, so i needed some razors beyond my basics from the shave shop.  This has offered me the opportunity to get many razors at a good price but also to try so many brands and determine which i like. The Merkur ones are my favorite so far.  Will be a while before i get through them all.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers who said they would substitute blade types - I wanted the personnas and naturally,  they were not included..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, same number of blades, just brands I was not as interested in.</li>
    <li> After shaving for about some 15 years, I was only introduced to DE shaving about two months ago.  Sad day, I know.  I could have bought a lot of beer with all the money I wasted on Mach 3s and the like. Now, a bit on blade reviews...I read a lot of reviews with people reporting nicking themselves and blaming blade sharpness. Slow down and concentrate on technique, DE shaving requires face preparation and finesse in driving the razor, not speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason we are here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great set of blades if you&#x27;re trying to find \\&quot;your\\&quot; brand.  Having said that, I did my research and decided to try them based on sharpness as reported by reviewers on the internet - starting with the Derby and ending with the sought-after Feather.  In order to fully appreciate the greatness of the upper echelon of the razors, I believe it&#x27;s important to get a feel for the lesser brands as well.  I found that for me and my shaving style, increased blade sharpness is synonymous with comfort.  Here is how I found the blades to stack up on comfort. I&#x27;ll rate them on a scale of 1-10, where a 10 is shaving bliss, and a 1 is ...well, let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;d rather shave with a dull kitchen knife.  You&#x27;ll see that the Feather stands apart from the crowd, it is sharp - few things come close if at all; followed by a group of what I thought were very respectable blades that were similar in performance.  Then there&#x27;s the other two brands that yielded a less than adequate experience.  Your experience may differ greatly - many variables are at play here, so trying them for yourself would make the most sense.  Of course I plan on revisiting each brand on this list and updating my ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------&lt;br /&gt;10 Feather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6-7 BIC, Wilkinson Sword, Astra&lt;br /&gt;4-5 Merkur, Shark, Derby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Dorco, Sharp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------</li>
    <li> Similar to another buyer&#x27;s experience, some razor brands were substituted--no Feather (Japan) or Red Personna (Israel) in my delivery.  Instead I received Shark (Egypt) and Treet (Pakistan); I don&#x27;t have experience with these two brands so I can&#x27;t comment if they are a comparable substitution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the seller&#x27;s disclaimer, I am a bit disappointed.  I was really looking forward to trying the Feather and Personna.  These brands get frequent mention as high-performance blades, and I believed they were readily available.</li>
    <li> Since I sport a full beard from Labor Day to Easter, it&#x27;ll be a slow extended period before a fair assessment can be made on these blades. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> ...I have a heavy beard and a baby face. Went back to the multi blade and Dorco is the best budget buy.</li>
    <li> Has a nice variety.  Great for finding out what you like and dont.  Havent tried all of them yet but leaning towards the feather hard box from Japan.  Incredibly sharp so watch out!</li>
