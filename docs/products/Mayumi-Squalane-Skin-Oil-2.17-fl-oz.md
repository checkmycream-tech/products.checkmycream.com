      <li>I have been using this product for over 15 years, always been great!</li>
      <li>It was good however this one is the best!!</li>
      <li>The most wonderful product  I ever used.  </li>
      <li>Good for men as well as women.  </li>
      <li>Really good for layering under your moisturizer at night, too.</li>
      <li>I have been using this oil for years and love it!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any remarkable/visible results, but I my skin seems to be holding its own.  </li>
      <li>Well I liked what I read after researching squalene.</li>
      <li>Very light and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>I love the way this product leaves skin.  </li>
      <li>and I love to use this product before my day and my night moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Great for my adult acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>It absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking like I&#x27;ve been sweating all day.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use</li>
      <li>I just turned 40, so this was a huge compliment.  </li>
      <li>Your product is fantastic and affordable.</li>
      <li>I find that patting my face lightly after applying helps to reduce shine.</li>
      <li>This is the same ingredient in many pricey creams &amp; serums, so buying it in the pure form is a good value.  </li>
      <li>A quick search hasn&#x27;t revealed if Mayumi sources the oil from a sustainable, regulated fishery.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
      <li>All in all, worth the cost for a product that lasts months.</li>
      <li>Have recommended to no less than a million people :)</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and because of that I have less wrinkles than most people my age.  </li>
      <li>it absorbs into the skin very quickly, you can use other products on top of it (if you choose, but I don&#x27;t)</li>
      <li>Just recently, I used up a gift certificate for a facial (never needed one) and the woman kept raving about how great my complexion looks.  </li>
      <li>First: I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be doing more buying in the future.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I will not get myself ready without it.</li>
      <li>so I look good by the time I buy the ranch if ya know what I mean.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting the all natural plant derived oil that I saw described on my favorite oil site (though, since they are closed for the holidays, I figured I&#x27;d try the store bought under this brand name instead).  </li>
      <li>pure natural oil\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Well absorbed, but make your t-zones extra shiny.  </li>
      <li>This is a very lightweight oil, easy to apply, you need very little and it is very helpful with lines/wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
      <li>and I get compliments on my 72 year old skin all the time.</li>
      <li>The reason for my review is that, though I bought this from a local supplement store, I read about it after I got home and found out this particular &#x27;squalane&#x27; is sourced from Shark Liver oil.</li>
      <li>I have used this for years because it moisturizes my skin like no other without being greasy.</li>
      <li>and my skin still looks like a 35 year old&#x27;s even though I&#x27;m currently 53!</li>

    <li> First: I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon.  I was looking for info and saw it here. The reason for my review is that, though I bought this from a local supplement store, I read about it after I got home and found out this particular &#x27;squalane&#x27; is sourced from Shark Liver oil. I thought I was getting the all natural plant derived oil that I saw described on my favorite oil site (though, since they are closed for the holidays, I figured I&#x27;d try the store bought under this brand name instead).  My only excuse is that I was shopping hungry and did not do my research!!  I have been playing around with different oil combinations for dry skin and, since there was no mention on the site (or the box this comes in) of the possibility that squalane can be derived from Shark Liver, I didn&#x27;t think twice when I saw \\&quot;100% pure natural oil\\&quot;.  A quick search hasn&#x27;t revealed if Mayumi sources the oil from a sustainable, regulated fishery.  I&#x27;m a bit uncomfortable having bought this now.  I guess if I find that the fishery is sustainable, and the rest of the shark is being used, it may not be so bad.  I eat meat, fish, etc.  But I try to get it from sustainable, well managed sources.  Had I known that there could be two different sources: shark AND olive, I would have purchased the plant based.  Sigh, lesson learned!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Just recently, I used up a gift certificate for a facial (never needed one) and the woman kept raving about how great my complexion looks.  I just turned 40, so this was a huge compliment.  All I&#x27;ve been using for the past 10 years is this product.    I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Good for men as well as women.  Can&#x27;t live without this.  Have recommended to no less than a million people :)</li>
    <li> Well I liked what I read after researching squalene. Your product is fantastic and affordable. I&#x27;ll be doing more buying in the future. I want to preserve my skin so I look good by the time I buy the ranch if ya know what I mean. ........Victoria</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for years and love it! Very light and non-greasy. I use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and because of that I have less wrinkles than most people my age.  It is easy to use and I use it both morning and night and sometimes during the day..  it absorbs into the skin very quickly, you can use other products on top of it (if you choose, but I don&#x27;t) and it is not greasy!</li>
    <li> I have used Mayumi now for over a year and I get compliments on my 72 year old skin all the time. I never want to be of it!</li>
    <li> I have used other squalene products, but found the Mayumi a lighter alternative to the heavier versions.  It absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking like I&#x27;ve been sweating all day.  Really good for layering under your moisturizer at night, too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years, always been great! I tried some other squalane derived from olives. It was good however this one is the best!!</li>
    <li> This is a very lightweight oil, easy to apply, you need very little and it is very helpful with lines/wrinkles.  I am 69 and I love to use this product before my day and my night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years because it moisturizes my skin like no other without being greasy.</li>
    <li> Excellent, it was recomended by my friend who has very beautiful skin without any makeup. She used have acen problem, but not anymore. This product helped to repair her damaged skin.</li>
    <li> The most wonderful product  I ever used.  It works.</li>
    <li> This product is a great base of my facial Treatment.  Can us for all of  body too.&lt;br /&gt;This is the brand to use.</li>
    <li> I started using Squalane oil about 15 years ago one my face before makeup and my skin still looks like a 35 year old&#x27;s even though I&#x27;m currently 53! It initially takes a while for your skin to adjust because you&#x27;re adding oil but it&#x27;s totally worth it. I will not get myself ready without it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product leaves skin.  I put o my face before going to bed and in the morning my face glows</li>
    <li> Great for my adult acne prone skin. Well absorbed, but make your t-zones extra shiny.  I find that patting my face lightly after applying helps to reduce shine.</li>
    <li> This is the same ingredient in many pricey creams &amp; serums, so buying it in the pure form is a good value.  I use it alone in the eye area all year, and on my face/neck during the winter.  I haven&#x27;t seen any remarkable/visible results, but I my skin seems to be holding its own.  I have also tried adding a few drops to literally any cream for use on the face &amp; body, &amp; it does increase the richness noticeably.  All in all, worth the cost for a product that lasts months.</li>
    <li> This works like charm for my wife. She always appreciates this product.</li>
    <li> been using it for years.  inexpensive way to look slightly younger than you are.</li>
