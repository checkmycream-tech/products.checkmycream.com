      <li>send me more stickers&lt;</li>
      <li>and I was more than pleased.</li>

      <li>Perfect for getting the ideal french tip or can be used to create other fingernail designs.  </li>

      <li>thank you very much.</li>
      <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t use these right, but when I did, the nail polish got right underneath them because they don&#x27;t stick on very well.</li>
      <li>I only received one package of nail tip, which I see has happened to more people than just me</li>
      <li>fast shipping even from China!  </li>
      <li>Thank you for the product would love to use it... and help me in the future...</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to use, they stick enough to do their job, but they&#x27;re not so sticky as to ruin your polish.</li>
      <li>They work as described on regular polish and are easy to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>She practiced for week straight until she got knack of airbrushing and nail work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very helpful.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be thinner, I have pretty big nails</li>
      <li>I really only use the french tip guides, I don&#x27;t use the other ones, but they&#x27;re cheap enough that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>The Seller gave me an extra pack as a gift which is appreciated.</li>
      <li>just so surprised to get one sticker&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>It got to me a week early and it came with a lot of them.</li>
      <li>Took a very long time to get here but was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>I am most definitely not happy.</li>
      <li>I basically wanted this for the basic French manicure, but the other shapes look like a lot of fun.  </li>
      <li>My nails are not wide at all and these stickers are so short they don&#x27;t even come off my nail</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much as I paid a little over a dollar, but I&#x27;m a big fan of getting what I think I&#x27;m paying for....</li>

<li> /&gt;So bad...</li>
<li> I wish I would have known I would have just went to a store and bought some rather than waiting for 3 weeks for crap.</li>
<li> When I peeled the sticker off, it pulled off my base layer of polish.  </li>

    <li> Perfect for getting the ideal french tip or can be used to create other fingernail designs.  The three styles of stickers makes it easy to make up your own styles or stick with tried-and-true looks that everyone knows</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit too sticky and peels off my nail polish....but it&#x27;s okay for just tips. Not recommended if you wanna do stripes...</li>
    <li> I just got these yesterday and I am so excited as to what creations I can make on my nails with the tapes. I use them all the time but it seems that I can only find them in French manicure kits in the store and I don&#x27;t want that. I use them to make lines on my nails, to make even spaces between polishes.</li>
    <li> These stickers leave the best lines with no smudging or smearing. The price is wonderful too, better than in the store. This is perfect for my nail art.</li>
    <li> My nails are not wide at all and these stickers are so short they don&#x27;t even come off my nail so I can peel them off. I had to attach two stickers together so I peel them off after painting. I wish I would have known I would have just went to a store and bought some rather than waiting for 3 weeks for crap.</li>
    <li> It says 10 PACK and I only got ONE. False advertisement don&#x27;t buy unless you only want one. Not happy.</li>
    <li> AAA+  fast shipping even from China!  As described.  Stickers are of quality.  I will be back to this shop for other designs of these stickers. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use these right, but when I did, the nail polish got right underneath them because they don&#x27;t stick on very well. Ruined 2 manicures trying to use these.</li>
    <li> Received only part of what was ordered.  The listing seems misleading.  Took three emails to fix situation.  A case of &amp;#34;get what you pay for&amp;#34; not what is advertsed.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3 pack nail tip guide and I only GOT ONE! I was waiting for these for a long time and now I&#x27;m disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what I paid to get. I will not recommend buying these for this seller.</li>
    <li> I thought I was purchasing 3 packs of these nail tips, however, instead of 3 packages (as advertised), I got one. I can&#x27;t complain too much as I paid a little over a dollar, but I&#x27;m a big fan of getting what I think I&#x27;m paying for....</li>
    <li> Gives perfect tips, love it!</li>
    <li> Ok, but not the perfect solution.</li>
    <li> I only received one package of nail tip, which I see has happened to more people than just me so I contacted the seller they said they would take care of it and will send out another package. They did and I just received it but again one got one package of nail tip, either the description or picture is incorrect or I need to get my eyes checked! Wouldn&#x27;t buy from this place again.</li>
    <li> I am most definitely not happy. I was supposed to receive 10 packs of the little sticker guides. I only received one. ONE! I am not satisfied. Especially considering they arrived two weeks late. Either give me my money back or send my other nine packs. Do not purchase these.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try some DIY nail art, but they don&#x27;t make the grade.  When I peeled the sticker off, it pulled off my base layer of polish.  They were inexpensive, so I don&#x27;t regret trying them, but I probably won&#x27;t use them again.</li>
    <li> The nail tip guides are awesome and very good quality. I give them four stars because the size of the guides aren&#x27;t wide enough for people who like acrylic nails and want these designs. They are sticky enough and when lifting does not leave the residue on the nail. The Seller gave me an extra pack as a gift which is appreciated. And they will definitely last a long time since I did order the ten packs. Will for sure order again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look easy to use</li>
    <li> Took a very long time to get here but was exactly what I ordered. Ten pack nail art French tips.</li>
    <li> I basically wanted this for the basic French manicure, but the other shapes look like a lot of fun.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, either.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be thinner, I have pretty big nails but i could only put two chevron stickers on one nail as a template. I wish it was thinner. But for the price, I think this is great.</li>
    <li> I got only one sticker&lt;br /&gt;What the.... Omg&lt;br /&gt;I just so surprised to get one sticker&lt;br /&gt;Just send me more stickers&lt;br /&gt;So bad...</li>
    <li> Nice 10 pack of nail art french tip forms guide stickers. They look as pictured and are packaged.They came about a week earlier.</li>
    <li> I love these! They&#x27;re easy to use, they stick enough to do their job, but they&#x27;re not so sticky as to ruin your polish. I really only use the french tip guides, I don&#x27;t use the other ones, but they&#x27;re cheap enough that&#x27;s fine.  I even bought some as a present!</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool stickers. They&#x27;re the best for trying to do French tip at home.</li>
    <li> It took a while for it to ship, but once it came in I used it a lot. It&#x27;s very helpful.</li>
    <li> It got to me a week early and it came with a lot of them. There were three different kinds and there&#x27;s about 15 of each in each pack and it came with 10 packs of them :) It works great and I will definitely be buying more since it&#x27;s really cheap :)</li>
    <li> They work as described on regular polish and are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately they don&#x27;t work too well with Shellac and Gel....</li>
    <li> Thank you for the product would love to use it... and help me in the future... thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Purchased as Christmas gift and daughter was delighted. She practiced for week straight until she got knack of airbrushing and nail work. I believe it is a good product and would recommend</li>
    <li> Ok so I have ordered these before and I was more than pleased. I got ten packs. Then I placed a second order well just received them and boy am I upset! I got one pack! So I came and checked the description and it says I&#x27;m supposed to get 3 packs which I would have been happy with but nope one pack. Disappointing considering how pleased I was previously.</li>
    <li> It said I will have 10 packs but I just received one pack</li>
