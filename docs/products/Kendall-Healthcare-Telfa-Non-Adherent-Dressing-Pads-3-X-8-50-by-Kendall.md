      <li>These really do the job.</li>
      <li>I keep these in my first aid kit and use them when there is a new wound that I don&#x27;t want tissue to stick to.</li>
      <li>I have used them before on various shallow wounds with great success and as dressings.</li>
      <li>I normally use the kedall telfa no adherent dressing pads and that is what I thought I was ordering this time but the pads i got in the mail were NOT kendall.</li>
      <li>Performs like the smaller 3x4&amp;#34; Tefla pads, but the longer 3x8&amp;#34; pad makes it appropriate for multiple wounds around the same area (e.g. on the leg).</li>
      <li>Great for long thin wounds.</li>
      <li>I buy the large size and then if I need smaller, I cut to size.  </li>
      <li>Can get 4 or 5 smaller out of one large.  </li>
      <li>I now use the telfa non stick pads, and the sores seem to clear up faster.  </li>
      <li>My orders have always come early</li>
      <li>My spouse was in a vehicular accident that left him with a large open wound that needed a dressing change a couple times per day.</li>
      <li>These particular ones are a bit long but can be cut to size for a non-sterile dressing change.</li>
      <li>appeared as the box was wet before and did not look new</li>

    <li> Love this for surgery wounds!</li>
    <li> I had major surgery 11 weeks ago; am still &amp;#34;changing bandages&amp;#34;, these are great! Does NOT stick to wound, great for large areas.</li>
    <li> When you want non-stick bandages, these are the real deal. They have a plastic-like coating that prevents them from adhering to the wound site. If this is what you need, it&#x27;s money well spent. I used them to cover the surgical site after hip surgery once the silver bandage came off to protect my healing skin.</li>
    <li> The are what I always buy in the store at a better price.  Have been using them for a while now.</li>
    <li> is what it is and does what it does</li>
    <li> These are so great! I purchased CVS brand first and they were awful. They stuck to the wound and were very painful to remove.

    <li> Performs like the smaller 3x4&amp;#34; Tefla pads, but the longer 3x8&amp;#34; pad makes it appropriate for multiple wounds around the same area (e.g. on the leg).</li>
    <li> These pads worked perfectly. I had substantial road rash from a biking accident and the emergency room nurse said to use these pads because they &#x27;non-stick&#x27;, and brother, was she right. I had tried a &#x27;non-stick&#x27; brand sold by both Wal-Mart and Walgrens which were anything but! I taped three of these pads together to cover one area, and that worked well, also. Telfa dressing were the best.</li>
    <li> Had a horse get a nasty cut on his hind leg.  I had to change the dressing every day.  These never stuck to the wound and were the best price available to a dumb guy like me!</li>
    <li> I have suffered with leg ulcers.  I now use the telfa non stick pads, and the sores seem to clear up faster.  I will keep using them as needed.  I purchased these pads from Amazon and was delighted with the price, also.</li>
    <li> Good for the purpose for which it was intended, and price much better than at medical supply store.</li>

    <li> Product arrived quickly and this type of dressing is perfect for delivering medication to a large leg wound on a horse without sticking to the wound.  It was just what I needed.  Each dressing is individually wrapped and sterile.</li>
    <li> I keep these in my first aid kit and use them when there is a new wound that I don&#x27;t want tissue to stick to.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for a burn and used it, it was a great price compare to the drug store price but packaging appeared as the box was wet before and did not look new, each dressing was still in sterile packing and I had to use it for the big area which I was treating for.</li>
    <li> Very fast service and of course a great product as always....Would reccomend to all customers as reliable and quick. Buy it.........</li>
    <li> these were used for dressing a surgical wound on the arm. These were exactly what I needed for  the wound</li>
    <li> Every medicine drawer or cabinet should have these bandages.  Should you have a cut, these bandages will not stick to the wound as it drys.  I cut them in smaller pieces to use.  The supply I received will last me for years.</li>
    <li> I was very upset and frustrated about this order.  I was notified that I would receive the pads between Sept. 27 and Oct. 2.  My orders have always come early and I really needed these pads.  They DID NOT arrive until today, Oct. 3.  HOWEVER on the box it was stamped that they were mailed on Sept. 25 and it also had  PRIORITY - 2 DAY on the label.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to address this problem!</li>
    <li> I buy the large size and then if I need smaller, I cut to size.  Can get 4 or 5 smaller out of one large.  First used these when I had&lt;br /&gt;a bad skin burn.  They do not stick to the wound or injured area which makes healing faster.  Gauze and band aids do stick.&lt;br /&gt;Then I use micro pore tape to hold the Telfa pad to the injury.  Micro pore tape does not stick to the skin, but holds tight.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Telfa non adhering products because they do not stick to wounds. These particular ones are a bit long but can be cut to size for a non-sterile dressing change. Good price!</li>
    <li> Tefla dressings are a must have for any first aid kit.  They work well for burns or any other wound you don&#x27;t want disturbed by sticking gauze.</li>
    <li> Put these in first aid kits. Can be cut &amp; used ,with good tape, as improvised band-aids for various size wounds. I have used them before on various shallow wounds with great success and as dressings. Each pad came individually sterile wrapped. Works for me.</li>
    <li> Great for long thin wounds.</li>
    <li> These really do the job. My spouse was in a vehicular accident that left him with a large open wound that needed a dressing change a couple times per day. These made it a whole lot less painful for him when I did the bandage changes. They can still get caught in the healing tissue or any seeping that dries at the edges of the bandage but way better than it being the whole area.</li>
    <li> these are very thin and do not absorb much.  But its a good price for a large quantity of dressings.</li>
