      <li>Remember, you can buy the best splint in the world but it won&#x27;t help if you cannot wear it.</li>
      <li>The PW shoes and the best insert form</li>
      <li>&quot; this is a great item to help you out!!</li>
      <li>Impressive.</li>
      <li>This is a very good item and</li>
      <li>And the cushioning is really cushy.  </li>
      <li>(Some great YouTube how-to</li>
      <li>Good Purchase</li>
      <li>Fits good.</li>
      <li>I cannot tell you how happy and satisfied I am with this product.  </li>
      <li>I promise you it&#x27;ll never be done on anyone I love!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own over the course of 2-3 months.  </li>
      <li>I was honestly amazed.  </li>
      <li>I wear a size 10 womens shoe, so i ordered the large--it fits nicely.  </li>
      <li>good at holding the foot at neutral position but most plantar fascitis cases would benefit from more dorsiflexed position.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also very comfortable to wear in bed or while lazing around the house.</li>
      <li>It needs to be more adjustable in the sense that you can adjust the angle</li>
      <li>I suprised at how fast my feet recovered and how great they felt.  </li>
      <li>You better be sure you&#x27;re going to love this before you spend $70!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I felt so much better that  </li>
      <li>OK...</li>
      <li>I have owned 4 different night splints and this one is the best.  </li>
      <li>The placement of the brace on the front allows greater foot movement, allows maximim air circulation, lets you place one foot on top of the foot with the brace in comfort.  </li>
      <li>This version is cheaper and much much better.  </li>
      <li>The many people who are stating in these reviews that they wind up ripping their splint off sometime during the night are NOT going to succeed at getting relief from their pain.  </li>
      <li>So for me and many others, a splint must allow more options in the degree of ankle \\&quot;flexion\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I continued wearing the splint while sleeping at night for about two months to be sure the pain did not return.</li>
      <li>but I can sleep while wearing it which makes it worthwhile.</li>
      <li>The A-Force splint seems like it may be better for helping ease pain in severe cases.</li>
      <li>Works pretty good for my PF when I wear it at night watching TV.</li>
      <li>This splint fits very comfortably and allows free movement of the toes.</li>
      <li>Make sure you read the fine print on this.  </li>
      <li>This is much more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>more comfortable when worn with a sock.</li>
      <li>This is much more comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
      <li>My foot easily moves out of position within minutes of putting it on.</li>
      <li>I highly suggest footwear with good arch support at all times.</li>
      <li>So I don&#x27;t feel I can give a 100% accurate review</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s comfortable and I look forward to wearing it because it relieves pain while I am sleeping.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a perfect foot splint for a few years now.</li>
      <li>Comfortable.  </li>
      <li>The dorsal night splint is comfortable and fits well.  </li>
      <li>I recalled that night splints were available for PF victims.  </li>
      <li>This item is also priced at a great price your doctors will charge you lots of $ for same item.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable, however, we are unsure of brand.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I own an older version of this splint which was much larger and worked great</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and cool.  </li>
      <li>First PF splint I have been able to sleep in.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to battle my foot pain (shoe inserts, special socks to wear a night, etc) and this gave me immediate relief.</li>
      <li>I have tried Cool Stretch boot forms, Dorsal Night Splint and Dorsal PF Night Splint by Alimed.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to put on and take off, not uncomfortable during sleep, and I can walk from the bed to the bathroom in the night with no discomfort, and don&#x27;t need to remove it.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight with a nice, straightforward design, and aside from the ankle thing (and the general irritation of having a plastic boot on one foot)</li>
      <li>If your footwear does not have adequate arch support, consider purchasing orthotic</li>
      <li>Got it quick.  </li>
      <li>In conclusion, this splint is very effective if used nighlty along with other therapy meant to treat Plantar Faciitis.  </li>
      <li>For a stiff splint it&#x27;s light and fairly forgiving to the light sleeper like me.  </li>
      <li>Heal pain dramatically reduced after the first night&#x27;s use!</li>
      <li>Those worked, but man were they HOT in the summer!  </li>
      <li>It could be better if the angle was a little more acute and the strap arrangement was more secure against the splingt sliding down.  </li>
      <li>It came with a great little rubberized pad with velcro on it to give the thing kind of a grippy sole on the bottom.  </li>
      <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth trying if you have plantar fasciitis.</li>
      <li>It is comfortable to sleep in and it has a little rubber pad on the bottom which makes nighttime bathroom trips more secure.  </li>
      <li>Gone is that first stab of pain stepping out of bed in the morning.</li>
      <li>, one week later, my pf is 80-90% better.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to MMM and TGIP and others for providing insightful reviews!  </li>
      <li>This is the first night splint I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had plantar faciitus and bone spur for 4 years now, I have tried many things that only marginally worked.  </li>
      <li>I had first thing in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I bit the bullet and bought this one after wasting my money on the first.  </li>
      <li>This works better than my larger night splint for my plantar fasciitis.  </li>
      <li>This means it&#x27;s more likely to stay on the patient (that&#x27;s you and me)</li>
      <li>when you take your first step out of bed - takes your breath away</li>
      <li>I played pretty well with some sensitivity.</li>
      <li>After several nights use the pain is over 90% better.  </li>
      <li>you can sleep pretty well with it.</li>
      <li>This splint is less bulky, more comfortable, easier to adjust, and works well.</li>
      <li>I put it on tight to feel more secure.</li>
      <li>If that sounds like your foot, make sure you choose a splint where your ankle will not be locked at a single angle over which you have no control, as it is with this brace.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the large size although some commenters said \\&quot;get</li>
      <li>I really like having all the plastic on the front.  </li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for something to really stretch the fascia while you sleep, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>The reason it (while comfortable) does not work for me is simply my anatomy.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I was very depressed to think I would give up tennis.      </li>
      <li>you change an insert to vary how much lift)  </li>
      <li>andfound a \\&quot;wrist strap\\&quot; in my tennis bag that fit my low instep foot.)  </li>
      <li>It is restrictive, and does not conform to the shape of the foot very well.</li>
      <li>Non-prescription NSAID&#x27;s such as Advil or generic Ibuprofen WILL indeed help reduce the severe pain associated with acute flare-ups.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone thru a few different models and this one is the most comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s main selling point is comfort.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Ok to sleep in have not notice a big change yet in my heel pain but it has not been that long either.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
      <li>so I was forced to go buy my own as he was charging 125 clams for his.    </li>
      <li>It is so comfortable compared to the other splints I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>And it makes my plantar fasciitis and my achilles tendonitis calm down, so that I can get up out of bed in the morning and step on the floor without pain, which, if you have either of these conditions you know that first step in the morning can just about kill you.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had problems with my feet because I stand all day for work and my toes tend to go forward when I sleep.  So I gave this a try and it felt weird at first, because my feet wanted to go forward but weren&#x27;t allowed.  However was I suprised at how fast my feet recovered and how great they felt.  If you have \\&quot;PF\\&quot; this is a great item to help you out!!</li>
    <li> Another reviewer of this product made a perfectly true point:  A night splint is the ONLY way to totally cure plantar fascitis.  Period.  Don&#x27;t waste your precious time and money on a podiatrist who will do one of two things, guaranteed:  Tell you what I just told you and be right, or tell you to have surgery and be wrong.  Do NOT let some selfish surgeon cut on you for this problem.  I promise you it&#x27;ll never be done on anyone I love!  It NEVER works and most of the time causes worse foot problems than it solves.  OK... off soapbox.    THIS splint is a mixed bag.  I&#x27;ve worn several over the years as I&#x27;ve had this problem off and on since before anyone knew the name of it, and fewer could pronounce it.    It&#x27;s main selling point is comfort.  For a stiff splint it&#x27;s light and fairly forgiving to the light sleeper like me.  This means it&#x27;s more likely to stay on the patient (that&#x27;s you and me) through the night, which it MUST in order to do its job.  The many people who are stating in these reviews that they wind up ripping their splint off sometime during the night are NOT going to succeed at getting relief from their pain.  This splint, a sock splint, ANY splint has to stay ON throughout the night, ALL night in order to work.  If your PF gets as bad as mine has at times, you&#x27;ll get used to having a night splint on.  This one&#x27;s a winner in that regard.    Unfortunately this splint does not heal my fascitis, although it may with those folks who have praised its effects.  The reason it (while comfortable) does not work for me is simply my anatomy.  I&#x27;ve got my Dad&#x27;s bird-legs and a lot of give in my joints, including my ankles and feet.  In order for this splint, a sock splint, ANY splint to cure PF, it must place a stretching tension (some, not too much) on the plantar fascia, the thin sling of muscle running along the bottom of the foot,  for the duration of time that the \\&quot;injured\\&quot; foot is at rest and trying to repair itself.  This is so the repair work occurs with the foot in approximately the same position as it&#x27;s in when you use it to walk.    So for me and many others, a splint must allow more options in the degree of ankle \\&quot;flexion\\&quot; (how much your toes point up toward your nose) before the plantar fascia can receive sufficient stretch for the tissue repairs to \\&quot;hold\\&quot; when the stress of the next walking or running event follows the stress of the next digital dinging, squeeking or oldie-covering event.    If that sounds like your foot, make sure you choose a splint where your ankle will not be locked at a single angle over which you have no control, as it is with this brace.  Those splints are pricier but for me, they&#x27;re the only ones that work, now that I can no longer seem to find sock-type splints.  Those worked, but man were they HOT in the summer!  (Read:  The patient didn&#x27;t leave them on like he should...)  -Ole Troll</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a perfect foot splint for a few years now. This is not a perfect solution. It is restrictive, and does not conform to the shape of the foot very well. The hard plastic form is cut from sheet plastic and has some sharp edges, and the padding does not protect the entire foot. The split nature of the toe form causes some tight fit issues, and circulation problems during extended wear. I have tried Cool Stretch boot forms, Dorsal Night Splint and Dorsal PF Night Splint by Alimed.  The Dorsal PF Night Splint wins hands down for comfort, ease of use, and wearability.</li>
    <li> First PF splint I have been able to sleep in.  So far it is performing as advertised</li>
    <li> Had another night splint from my Dr. that was hard to use. I kept taking it off in the middle of the night because it was uncomfortable. This splint is less bulky, more comfortable, easier to adjust, and works well. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the first night splint I&#x27;ve tried. I have an early/mild case of plantar fasciitis, so I&#x27;m trying to find ways to keep it from getting worse. The A-Force splint seems like it may be better for helping ease pain in severe cases. It keeps your foot at a relaxed flex, so it prevents the foot from curling and cramping, but it doesn&#x27;t do a lot to actually stretch the fascia. I would prefer something with a sharper angle, that actually pushed or pulled the foot back toward the shin more so that instead of not-shrinking, the fascia was lengthening a little.    Also, you have to wear it with a sock, or else the plastic rubs up against your ankle bone. After a few nights&#x27; use I had a bruise there that made the thing painful to wear, so I had to take a couple of nights off.    It is lightweight with a nice, straightforward design, and aside from the ankle thing (and the general irritation of having a plastic boot on one foot) you can sleep pretty well with it. And for someone with a really bad case of PF, that relaxed flex may be just what you need. But if you&#x27;re looking for something to really stretch the fascia while you sleep, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> good at holding the foot at neutral position but most plantar fascitis cases would benefit from more dorsiflexed position.  more comfortable when worn with a sock.</li>
    <li> Got it quick.  It does not work quite as well as the doctor prescribed night splint but I can sleep while wearing it which makes it worthwhile.</li>
    <li> I have woke up with no pain since I started using these on both ankles. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is so comfortable compared to the other splints I&#x27;ve tried.  I really like having all the plastic on the front.  And the cushioning is really cushy.  And it makes my plantar fasciitis and my achilles tendonitis calm down, so that I can get up out of bed in the morning and step on the floor without pain, which, if you have either of these conditions you know that first step in the morning can just about kill you.  An added perk: Once I have this thing on, I can take a step or two in it without feeling like I&#x27;m going to break it or slip and fall.  It came with a great little rubberized pad with velcro on it to give the thing kind of a grippy sole on the bottom.  You can&#x27;t go for walks, but you could go to the bathroom in the middle of the night if you needed to. I chose the mens because my feet are super wide, and I have plenty of room.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the splint does keep my foot in place.  My foot easily moves out of position within minutes of putting it on.</li>
    <li> This works better than my larger night splint for my plantar fasciitis.  This is much more comfortable to sleep in.  It could be better if the angle was a little more acute and the strap arrangement was more secure against the splingt sliding down.  I put it on tight to feel more secure.</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 different night splints and this one is the best.  I have used the over the counter Futuro brand you find in the pharmacy--the ones the pull your toe up sucks.  They make my toes to numb.  My podiatrist gave me a very fancy one and it broke 6 months later so I was forced to go buy my own as he was charging 125 clams for his.    This version is cheaper and much much better.  The strap wraps around your lower calf/ankle it fits my big legs.  It is comfortable to sleep in and it has a little rubber pad on the bottom which makes nighttime bathroom trips more secure.  Best of all, no pull on toes and no tingly feet!    I wear a size 10 womens shoe, so i ordered the large--it fits nicely.  Worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> The dorsal night splint is comfortable and fits well.  This is a very good item and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> definitely relieved my plantar fascitis within a couple of wearings.  yes - it took some time to get used to wearing it at night, but the result: practically no foot pain when i get out of bed in the morning, nor lingering pain throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the medical supply company in my town wanted $130 for a single splint, so Amazon has done it again!</li>
    <li> Anyone that&#x27;s ever had a heel spur knows the excruciating pain that&#x27;s felt.  I had this years ago wore it religiously haven&#x27;t had for 10 years but recently felt a little pain so I got again.  All I have to say is it will work for you avoid the need for surgery. Cortisone shots are temporary then pain returns. This item is also priced at a great price your doctors will charge you lots of $ for same item.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I think this may help someone like it did for me.  I bought the traditional splint first.  Hated it.  I could only keep it on for a couple of hours until it drove me nuts and I had to take it off.  I bit the bullet and bought this one after wasting my money on the first.  Wow, what a difference.  You&#x27;ll still notice that you are wearing a splint but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad.  It&#x27;s beginning to help my plantar fasciitis.  Remember, you can buy the best splint in the world but it won&#x27;t help if you cannot wear it.</li>
    <li> I found the splint helped relieve my plantar fasciitis within a couple of days.  The main part where your foot fits was a little too big but wearing a thick sock secured the foot much better.  I continued wearing the splint while sleeping at night for about two months to be sure the pain did not return. Definitely worth trying if you have plantar fasciitis.</li>
    <li> awkward to wear but seems to work.  once you get comfortable  its not to bad.  my husband has large feet  &amp;#60;size 13&amp;#62;  and it adjust big enough for him.</li>
    <li> Ok to sleep in have not notice a big change yet in my heel pain but it has not been that long either. So I don&#x27;t feel I can give a 100% accurate review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had plantar faciitus and bone spur for 4 years now, I have tried many things that only marginally worked.  I bought the \\&quot;A-Force Dorsal Night Splint - Large\\&quot; 3 weeks ago, and I used it for the first time last night. Believe it or Not, I feel great , I am only feeling very small pain right now compared to the other times. I will wear this nightly for the next couple of weeks to see what happens.  I only wish I bought years ago. Thank you Amazon for having this!!!!</li>
    <li> Thanks to MMM and TGIP and others for providing insightful reviews!  About 90 days ago I got Plantar Fasciitis by straining my foot in a tennis match.  I have a runner friend who had complained about it a few years ago ... said it was incurable... was bummed because he had to give up running.  I was very depressed to think I would give up tennis.      I read and tried everything I could find on the net:  the stretches, the icing down, rolling the foot on the little ball thingy, stretching on stairs, on  2x4.  I bought PW Minor orthotic shoes and tried 20 different orthotic inserts from full foot of every gyration to heel cups.  The PW shoes and the best insert form me was the \\&quot;adjustable arch support\\&quot; by Dr. Scholls.. you change an insert to vary how much lift)  They eased the pain during walking... but no progress was being made.      Every morning, I would get out of bed, put my foot down, and stabbing pain!  Then a bolt of lightning arrived with the stabbing pain:  \\&quot;something is happening at night to reinjure my foot!\\&quot;  I recalled that night splints were available for PF victims.  I searched and found the A force Dorsal Night Splint! What these folks and others said made sense: this one is the smallest and least invasive of your sleep.  I bought it 3 days ago.    The first night it was annoying, because my foot wanted to curl and point straight away from me to relieve the natural tension of the Plantar.. the running muscle/tissue.  I got it too tight.  I loosened it, then took it off mid night.  (Leave it rather loose, so your foot can occasionally point down to relieve the tension of being in one position.)  Even though I could only stand it half a night... the next morning I noticed that my \\&quot;touchdown pain\\&quot; was less.  I felt so much better that  I risked tennis for the second time in three months (first try was a painful disaster.  Could barely walk the following day.)      When I played, I also recalled a post about an ace bandage wrap for the arch area.. andfound a \\&quot;wrist strap\\&quot; in my tennis bag that fit my low instep foot.)  Miracle!  With the bandage wrapped around my arch, the Dr. Scholls adjustable arch pad... I played pretty well with some sensitivity. But there was no lingering pain afterward.  And the third night with this device \\&quot;touchdown pain\\&quot; was very substantially reduced... almost gone!    I have a size 11.5 B foot with low instep and flat feet.  I ordered the large size although some commenters said \\&quot;get the smaller size.\\&quot;  I would recommend getting the correct size:  you do not want it even snug, surely not tight.  With it loosely wrapped around your foot, it will keep your foot at ninety degrees plus or minus.. allowing you to move it slightly, and lessening the sensation of being restricted.  This is much more comfortable.  But it is still enough to accomplish keeping your foot from curling downward and tightening the PF.    The placement of the brace on the front allows greater foot movement, allows maximim air circulation, lets you place one foot on top of the foot with the brace in comfort.  If you had the other kind, the edge of the brace would jab your other foot, be heavy and cumbersome if you are a  flipper like I am.    I cannot tell you how happy and satisfied I am with this product.  I expect I will be fully cured withing weeks, not months and years.  Thank you, Amazon for this product and forum!  You have given me back my life.</li>
    <li> I believe this boot could work for some people but i cant recommend it. It needs to be more adjustable in the sense that you can adjust the angle you want your foot at.</li>
    <li> This boot has been a Godsend. I&#x27;ve tried everything to battle my foot pain (shoe inserts, special socks to wear a night, etc) and this gave me immediate relief. Gone is that first stab of pain stepping out of bed in the morning. it&#x27;s also very comfortable to wear in bed or while lazing around the house. I feel like I am finally on the way to curing my foot pain.</li>
    <li> My achilles feels much better in the morning, and it hasn&#x27;t had a negative effect on my sleep.  Good Purchase</li>
    <li> I had plantar fasciitis and I tried three things at one, this splint, stretches for my feet, and Keen shoes. I don&#x27;t know if the answer was one or all of these, but the combination has relived the pain I was experiencing. Wearing this splint did have an immediate affect on the pain I felt in the morning. It is a little awkward to wear, but did not affect my sleep significantly. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Dorsal Night Splint is a very useful tool in the treatment of Plantar Fasciitis, which typically exhibits itself with sever pain in the heel region of the foot, especially in the morning after taking your first few steps.  This splint fits very comfortably and allows free movement of the toes. Wearing a sock under the splint is not required. The purpose of this splint is to help maintain an \\&quot;anatomical neutral\\&quot; position of the foot while sleeping in an effort to keep the Plantar Facia stretched. Although I have found significant improvement in my condition, it does require nightly use in conjunction with other therapy. I highly suggest footwear with good arch support at all times. If your footwear does not have adequate arch support, consider purchasing orthotic inserts(I suggest ProFoot brand)for your shoes which can be purchased from any general reatailer that carries foot support products. These orthotic inserts can be purcahsed typically for under $10. I highly suggest that you avoid walking with bare feet for any extended periods. In addition, I find that stretching the foot and Plantar Facia several times a day, especially prior to and after any long walks will prove to be very helpful in reducing the onset, severity, or length of discomfort. Non-prescription NSAID&#x27;s such as Advil or generic Ibuprofen WILL indeed help reduce the severe pain associated with acute flare-ups. In conclusion, this splint is very effective if used nighlty along with other therapy meant to treat Plantar Faciitis.  Be patient, be diciplined, this condition will not resolve itself over night, it may take weeks or even months to achieve desired results.</li>
    <li> Heal pain dramatically reduced after the first night&#x27;s use!</li>
    <li> Fits good. I bought it for one of my feet for Plantar Fasciitis and my comfort went up as long as I wore it in bed.</li>
    <li> I have gotten nearly immediate relief from the pain of plantar fasciitis after using this splint for 5 days.  Impressive. It is easy to put on and take off, not uncomfortable during sleep, and I can walk from the bed to the bathroom in the night with no discomfort, and don&#x27;t need to remove it.</li>
    <li> After suffering with PF for a year in my right foot I finally broke down and purchased this splint when my left became effected.  I was honestly amazed.  After one night of use on my right foot the pain was noticeably less!  After several nights use the pain is over 90% better.  I am buying one for my other foot post haste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had plantar fasciitis a couple times prior and it&#x27;s usually gone away on it&#x27;s own over the course of 2-3 months.  This last bout, though, lasted over a year.  If you&#x27;ve had it, you know the drill.  Sharp pain in the morning when you take your first step out of bed - takes your breath away and you have to stand in place for a bit to gird for the next step.  Pain and limping following a walk or a run.  After 12 months of it, I decided it was time for drastic action.  I had a podiatrist make me a set of hard orthotics.  This provided support, and eased pf symptoms a bit.  I started some home physical therapy (see below).  And I bought this night splint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dorsal night splint immediately relieved the pain I had first thing in the morning.  It&#x27;s not intrusive (it&#x27;s not romantic either, but hey).  It&#x27;s comfortable and cool.  It doesn&#x27;t interfere with my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, one week later, my pf is 80-90% better.  And I have not stopped my weekend runs, although I&#x27;ve cut down on distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the things I&#x27;ve done that have made a difference for me:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; The dorsal night splint&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Hard orthotics&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Massaging the heel and arch with a lacrosse ball&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Using a Theraband to stretch the big toe back.  1 min, 2-3 times/day.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Using a Theraband to strengthen the four small toes, flexing toward the floor.  50 reps, 2-3 times/day.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Wear shoes with structure while running, rather than minimalist shoes.  Shortening stride and increasing cadence.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Focused calf stretches.  1 min, 2-3 times/day.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Taping the foot.  (Some great YouTube how-to videos)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of these has nearly eliminated pf symptoms in one week.  I&#x27;d give the night splint the bulk of the credit for my recovery.  Inexpensive.  Comfortable.  Immediate improvement.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works pretty good for my PF when I wear it at night watching TV.</li>
    <li> Make sure you read the fine print on this.  Since it&#x27;s shipped from Florida, it cannot be returned due to some medical device law.  It is too expensive to not allow returns.  I learned the hard way.  For it to truly position your foot correctly, the back straps along the calf cut into your leg.  It is so uncomfortable.  It needs to be extremely tight to be in the right place, and then it&#x27;s as if you have a tourniquet on your leg.&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from plantar fascitis for a year and a half, and would try anything for the pain to go away.  THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER!!!  My mom has one similar that has one large, padded strap that goes behind your calf.  It is comfortable, however, we are unsure of brand.&lt;br /&gt;For no returns, Amazon should have big, bold red print before you check out.  I emailed the seller via Amazon to ask for a refund and was denied.  You better be sure you&#x27;re going to love this before you spend $70!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST RECHECKED ORDERING SITE: NO WHERE DOES IT SAY \\&quot;NO RETURN ALLOWED\\&quot;  HOW SHADY OF SELLER AND AMAZON TO NOT BE UP FRONT WITH A NO RETURN POLICY BEFORE PURCHASE!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month and it seems to be working. I guess it takes 6 months, so we&#x27;ll see. But it&#x27;s comfortable and I look forward to wearing it because it relieves pain while I am sleeping.</li>
    <li> The splint has helped my Achilles&#x27; tendonitis by keeping my foot in position. It is light weight and not at all uncomfortable to sleep in. I have no pain when I get up and walk on my foot in the morning.</li>
    <li> I own an older version of this splint which was much larger and worked great but the Velcro wore out. This splint is very small in comparison.  Wondering if I received a mislabeled size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone thru a few different models and this one is the most comfortable.  My foot does not get hot, walking to the bathroom in it isn&#x27;t too uncomfortable.  I just wish my injury would heal faster.</li>
    <li> These boots don&#x27;t bend the ankle enough to have any real stretch on the plantar area.  Didn&#x27;t help at all.  I ended up buying the cheaper sock with the connection to the upper calf so you can adjust the stretch.</li>
