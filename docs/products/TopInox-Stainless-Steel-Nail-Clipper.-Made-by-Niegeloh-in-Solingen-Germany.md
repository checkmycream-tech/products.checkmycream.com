### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are well designed, perfectly finished nail clippers---They just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>It looked and felt great.</li>
      <li>producct great</li>
      <li>It is great to have and we are happy with it.</li>
      <li>Simply the best - wonderful stocking stuffer for anyone but especially nice for that guy on your list - unless he looses these you will never have to purchase another nail clipper as these are so beautifully made.</li>
      <li>Very good, have been using this brand for many years.</li>
      <li>This is perfectly good nail clipper.</li>
      <li>These are really nice quality clippers.  </li>
      <li>I had seen them being manufactured on a TV show and really liked</li>
      <li>The clipper and the separate nail file came in a nice letter carrying case and have the look of a quality set.  </li>
      <li>I never received any kind of reply.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived in a nice box that could be used for a gift without wrapping paper.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Furthermore, for the job it does, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>You will be better off with a $3 one from CVS.</li>
      <li>I have had about a dozen or so nail clippers and they all work okay for clipping nails.  </li>
      <li>Better to buy the cheap-o&#x27;s, IMHO.</li>
      <li>The sharpest, most comfortable to hold clippers ever.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These are a good in-between from the absolute cheapest to the $70 klhips, which I could not justify buying.</li>
      <li>The documentary promised great things and I was looking forward to using this precision  instrument.</li>
      <li>Precise cuts.  </li>
      <li>The pressure required to keep the tool under your nail limits your ability to cut the nail precisely where you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
      <li>But when I used it, instead of a clean cut, it tore the nail like a worn-out $1.00 cheap-o from the drugstore.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing superior in this product above and beyond a drug store clipper and no reason to pay a substantial premium.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok to trim your fingernails but it&#x27;s really too small.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was delivery quickly.</li>
      <li>excellent quality, sharp and seamless cuts</li>
      <li>Assuming they last a while, I&#x27;ll have been glad to spend 3x the price of a cheap drugstore</li>
      <li>The finish is good and the blades are sharp.</li>
      <li>think it would make more sense to buy a clipper one fourth</li>
      <li>great product but shipping much too slow.</li>
      <li>Instead of \\&quot;clipping\\&quot; with a positive click, the Niegeloh attempts to cut and often tears the nail.  </li>
      <li>The product lasts a long time and is better than what you can buy at the drug store.</li>
      <li>This is a much better nail clipper than the cheap chrome plated versions sold elsewhere that tend to rust and stain counters if left in damp or wet locations like bathrooms.</li>
      <li>They also were very prone to losing their sharpness quite rapidly.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell the difference with much cheaper units that I can buy anywhere.</li>
      <li>Given the price, this should be a flawless cutting instrument.  </li>
      <li>would not recommend these clippers if they were priced in line with  many other clippers on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Cut ok but would move while pressing down to cut nail.</li>
      <li>Although the price is almost 10x the price of a Revlon clipper at the local store - I thought it was worth it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If I ever lose mine I will order a new pair.  </li>
      <li>After years of cheap Chinese junk, we purchased this German clipper.</li>
      <li>I truly enjoy using them as it takes a lot less effort when I have occasion to need them.  </li>
      <li>...the stainless used is somehow flexible, so unless your nails are wet and softened, it might not cut all the way (and my nails are very standard).&lt;br</li>
      <li>It took a few uses before I felt comfortable using them.  </li>
      <li>I am even going to order the larger ones designed for the toes very soon.  </li>
      <li>I have had many nail clippers in the past and after a short period of time I would begin finding them in 3 pieces in my pocket.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting incredible things, even though it was a little pricy for a common ordinary item.  </li>
      <li>When you finally get the tool under your nail and wedged in place there is no satisfying snap of a cleanly cut nail.  </li>

<li> When you finally get the tool under your nail and wedged in place there is no satisfying snap of a cleanly cut nail.  </li>
<li> Oddly, it does not work as well for normal clipping of nails, but I have plenty of other nail clippers for that.</li>
<li> very sharp, old pair (15 years old) finally got too dull to cut.  </li>
<li> I suppose for the money, it&#x27;s expected to stay sharp and keep working for an extra long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It may take some slight amount of less pressure to clip the nail due to the blade being slightly sharper than a basic clipper, but that does not justify the extra cost of this item above an average priced clipper.</li>
<li> The bottom \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; that is supposed to go under your nail is so wide at its face that you have to work it under your nail before you can clip the nail.  </li>
<li> Sharp, durable edges - precision cuts  - ever tears your nails.  </li>
<li> it has remained sharp and has never come apart.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re very sharp and almost don&#x27;t require the use of a file after clipping.  </li>
<li> The clipper&#x27;s teeth look very sharp but they smash and tear the nail anyway.  </li>
<li> so small that my above average size hands have a hard time keeping hold while I clip my nails.&lt;br</li>
<li> They&#x27;re missing the attached little nail file/finger nail cleaner.  </li>
<li> is too small for toenails, for example, and give it its due; it wasn&#x27;t designed for that!</li>
<li> This is a small device-</li>
<li> sum up- too small and too expensive.</li>
<li> Be warned, Niegeloh does not appear to stand behind this product.</li>
<li> Otherwise, you risk pulling the hangnail and making it worse.  </li>
<li> Looking closer at the cutting edge, I saw the problem; the cutting edges were not closing together vertically and were slightly offset laterally.  </li>
<li> inquiry by me got wrong information as well.  </li>
<li> This is tedious.  </li>
<li> I thought that the clipper was going to be sharper, meaning the cutting &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> I cannot see any visible misalignment of the cutting blade.  </li>

    <li> ...the stainless used is somehow flexible, so unless your nails are wet and softened, it might not cut all the way (and my nails are very standard).&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering this for your toes, forget it. You will be better off with a $3 one from CVS.</li>
    <li> Seems flimsy. Cut ok but would move while pressing down to cut nail.</li>
    <li> Worth every penny!  I have had about a dozen or so nail clippers and they all work okay for clipping nails.  However, to clip a hangnail requires a precision instrument and this is it.  Otherwise, you risk pulling the hangnail and making it worse.  Oddly, it does not work as well for normal clipping of nails, but I have plenty of other nail clippers for that.</li>
    <li> The sharpest, most comfortable to hold clippers ever.  Which is why they keep walking away.  Next ones, I&#x27;m hiding in my sock drawer.</li>
    <li> Simply the best - wonderful stocking stuffer for anyone but especially nice for that guy on your list - unless he looses these you will never have to purchase another nail clipper as these are so beautifully made.</li>
    <li> These are well designed, perfectly finished nail clippers---They just don&#x27;t work.  The bottom \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; that is supposed to go under your nail is so wide at its face that you have to work it under your nail before you can clip the nail.  This is tedious.  The pressure required to keep the tool under your nail limits your ability to cut the nail precisely where you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That might be acceptable if the clippers cut well, but they don&#x27;t do that either.  When you finally get the tool under your nail and wedged in place there is no satisfying snap of a cleanly cut nail.  The clipper&#x27;s teeth look very sharp but they smash and tear the nail anyway.  These clippers turn a 5 minute job into a 20 minute struggle that demands a nail file afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these clippers if they were priced in line with  many other clippers on Amazon.  At 3 times the price, stay away for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I wrote this review, I tried to contact the manufacturer via their Contact Us form online.  I never received any kind of reply.  Be warned, Niegeloh does not appear to stand behind this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a file, so the lack of one wasn&#x27;t an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual clipping is with ease, the clippers feel quality. Assuming they last a while, I&#x27;ll have been glad to spend 3x the price of a cheap drugstore pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a good in-between from the absolute cheapest to the $70 klhips, which I could not justify buying.</li>
    <li> I thought that the clipper was going to be sharper, meaning the cutting &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;. I can&#x27;t tell the difference with much cheaper units that I can buy anywhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok to trim your fingernails but it&#x27;s really too small.&lt;br /&gt;I would put it in a travel kit but use the larger 3&amp;#34; one for home.&lt;br /&gt;This is too small for toenails, for example, and give it its due; it wasn&#x27;t designed for that!</li>
    <li> My wife got this for me as a Birthday gift.  I had seen them being manufactured on a TV show and really liked it&#x27;s features.  I have had many nail clippers in the past and after a short period of time I would begin finding them in 3 pieces in my pocket.  I would have to gather the pieces and put the item back together.  They also were very prone to losing their sharpness quite rapidly.  Now that I have the Topinox it has remained sharp and has never come apart.  I truly enjoy using them as it takes a lot less effort when I have occasion to need them.  If I ever lose mine I will order a new pair.  I am even going to order the larger ones designed for the toes very soon.  If you want the Cadillac of clippers, get yourself one of these.</li>
    <li> Quality construction.  Precise cuts.  Sharp, durable edges - precision cuts  - ever tears your nails.  I would recommend these nail clippers to everyone.</li>
    <li> After years of cheap Chinese junk, we purchased this German clipper. It is great to have and we are happy with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this immediately after seeing how they were manufactured on a &amp;#34;How its Made&amp;#34; TV documentary.  I was expecting incredible things, even though it was a little pricy for a common ordinary item.  The documentary promised great things and I was looking forward to using this precision  instrument. Things started out well.  It was delivery quickly. It looked and felt great. But when I used it, instead of a clean cut, it tore the nail like a worn-out $1.00 cheap-o from the drugstore.  Looking closer at the cutting edge, I saw the problem; the cutting edges were not closing together vertically and were slightly offset laterally.  Not the precision instrument the documentary lead me to expect.  Better to buy the cheap-o&#x27;s, IMHO.</li>
    <li> excellent quality, sharp and seamless cuts</li>
    <li> These are really nice quality clippers.  They&#x27;re very sharp and almost don&#x27;t require the use of a file after clipping.  When open, they are a slightly different shape than I&#x27;m used to.  It took a few uses before I felt comfortable using them.  They&#x27;re missing the attached little nail file/finger nail cleaner.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it in case it might someone else.</li>
    <li> very sharp, old pair (15 years old) finally got too dull to cut.  should have bought these years ago.</li>
    <li> I had one before and wanted a second one.  The product lasts a long time and is better than what you can buy at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Very good, have been using this brand for many years.</li>
    <li> great product but shipping much too slow. inquiry by me got wrong information as well.  producct great</li>
    <li> This is perfectly good nail clipper. The finish is good and the blades are sharp. There is no file or cleaning tool.  There is nothing superior in this product above and beyond a drug store clipper and no reason to pay a substantial premium.  It may take some slight amount of less pressure to clip the nail due to the blade being slightly sharper than a basic clipper, but that does not justify the extra cost of this item above an average priced clipper.</li>
    <li> This is a much better nail clipper than the cheap chrome plated versions sold elsewhere that tend to rust and stain counters if left in damp or wet locations like bathrooms.</li>
    <li> I feel I have to be self indulgent to spend $28 on a nail clipper. Shame on me though for not appreciating the size of the clipper from the dimensions that are provided. This is a small device- so small that my above average size hands have a hard time keeping hold while I clip my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, for the job it does, it&#x27;s ok. I suppose for the money, it&#x27;s expected to stay sharp and keep working for an extra long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would make more sense to buy a clipper one fourth it&#x27;s price and replace when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up- too small and too expensive.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Niegeloh nail clipper after seeing an episode of \\&quot;How It&#x27;s Made\\&quot;.  Although the price is almost 10x the price of a Revlon clipper at the local store - I thought it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a nice box that could be used for a gift without wrapping paper.  The clipper and the separate nail file came in a nice letter carrying case and have the look of a quality set.  However, the performance of the product fell substantially short.  Instead of \\&quot;clipping\\&quot; with a positive click, the Niegeloh attempts to cut and often tears the nail.  I cannot see any visible misalignment of the cutting blade.  Given the price, this should be a flawless cutting instrument.  I have given-up and am back to my Revlon nail clippers.  I feel duped!</li>
