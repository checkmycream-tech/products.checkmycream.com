      <li>I applied gel nails for the first time last month and wanted to try this out as it seemed like it would be much easier then filing and drilling color off my nails.</li>
      <li>It dissolves the polish quickly, it has a nice subtle scent, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my fingers.</li>

    <li> There is no comparison when it comes to the quality of this nail polish remover.  It&#x27;s non irritating and removes old, thick polish very fast with no mess.  You barely need to rub it on your nails for it to work and it doesn&#x27;t smear the color into your cuticles and under your fingernails like a lot of other removers.  That, and it&#x27;s not nearly as potent smelling as your typical acetone products.     It&#x27;s the only polish remover I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s only $15 for a huge bottle, and it has lasted me forever. I ordered it months ago and it&#x27;s not even 1/3 gone yet! Anyway, it&#x27;s the perfect polish remover. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails and hands. It smells very pleasant, like oranges. It&#x27;s very effective and removes all trace of polish. It&#x27;s also good on those tough glitters. I love Expert Touch. I won&#x27;t ever switch!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and a lot of nail polish removers irritate it but this stuff doesn&#x27;t. It removes my nail polish quickly and completely and smells OK, too.</li>
    <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t make my nails feel dry afterwards like other removers do.the smell is not over powering either. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Best nail polish remover I&#x27;ve used! Been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> Works very well and am happy about that but mine did not have a seal under the initial twist cap.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my bottle was not as full as the one in the photo. It was about an inch below that. Was only filled to the line you can see on the bottle, right above the words \\&quot;Beauty zone 2011\\&quot; in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;Kind of sketched out that mine was used???&lt;br /&gt;So those two things were frustrating.</li>
    <li> I lover this remover because it takes off any kind of nail polish that you are wearing with just one or 2 wipes</li>
    <li> Good value in the larger size&lt;br /&gt;Better performance than other polish removers. Does not dry my cuticles and the smell is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Good, quick service!!</li>
    <li> This is my my favorite polish remover and I love buying it in this size. I change my polish often so I DO go through a lot of this stuff! I find that the formula is quite gentle on my nails even though they get painted two to three times a week. I think that my nails would not be in as good shape without this excellent remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vendor offered quick shipping and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this lacquer remover to replenish what I had. I originally bought it at a beauty show and thought what a great product, gentle not as smelly as the normal brands on the market. I was surprised to find it at such a good price. Definitely would recommend. The only reason I gave it four stars was the product had leaked I guess because of shipping.</li>
    <li> This is great it works very well and does not causes by dryness or cracking of my nails. Easy to use and I use it 2 times per week.</li>
    <li> I received my 32oz bottle of lacquer remover from you sooner than I expected. Thank you!! I ordered a 16oz. bottle, for a friend, from a different seller because I couldn&#x27;t find where you carried that size, it should of arrived 4 days ago.I ordered the 16oz bottle 3 weeks ago.  I use Shellac nail colors and this product removes the shellac and is very gentle on my nails and skin. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will only order from you the next time I need lacquer remover.</li>
    <li> It stuff works great on regular nail polish.  It doesn&#x27;t work so well on the gel nail lacquer but I didn&#x27;t expect it.  It dissolves the polish quickly, it has a nice subtle scent, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my fingers.</li>
    <li> Great soak off product, overpriced but it does help vs. regular acetone without any oils. Keeps from drying out the nails &amp; cuticles more than they already are</li>
    <li> This is by far the best nail polish remover I&#x27;ve used. The 4 oz bottles found in stores weren&#x27;t lasting long enough. I change my polish about once a week. Bought this huge container, and I just refill my smaller bottles, perfect. I will buy again once this one runs out. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect price and size.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  It gets glitter off and conditions your nails in a way you can feel.  This stuff is good!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading reviews for Opi Expert Touch Removal Wraps 250ct, saying this product was recommended. I applied gel nails for the first time last month and wanted to try this out as it seemed like it would be much easier then filing and drilling color off my nails. You&#x27;re supposed to put the remover on the pads that are attached to the foil, then wrap your hands in a warm towel for 15 minutes and the polish is supposed to come off with the push of an orange stick. I did exactly as directed, and when I took the remover soaked wraps off my nails, my nails looked just like the did before I put the remover on them. It did not take my polish off at all. I could only file and drill the polish off. I did use the remover once most of the polish was drilled off, and it did clean my nails the rest of the way BUT - why purchase something if it doesn&#x27;t work as it was supposed to. I now have wraps that do not work and a ton of polish remover....which will take forever to use.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 3 stars because even without the wraps - I feel this polish remover should remove polish without having to drill most of the polish off first. I&#x27;ve done my nails for a long, long time and have never had such problems taking my polish off as I have with this product. Even using it on non-gel polish, it take a while to get off.</li>
