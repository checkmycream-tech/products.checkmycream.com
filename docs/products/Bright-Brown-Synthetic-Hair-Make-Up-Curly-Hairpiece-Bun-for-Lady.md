      <li>A bit pricey for the quality but the combination of colors are nice.  </li>
      <li>I just ordered two more of these, so you know they&#x27;ve got to be good.</li>
      <li>very easy to use</li>
      <li>Many people compliment me when I wear these, which is practically every day because it&#x27;s so easy to have a nice hair day with these.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>but I ordered this because it looked cute</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for getting ready fast on a beach vacation.</li>
      <li>It is a good add on piece, especially if you have thinning hair at the crown.</li>
      <li>I ordered another elsewhere for twice as much and it is much better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;the color matched my own well enough and the image was accurate.</li>
      <li>Pretty flimsey, not the right color...</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s okay was not what I expected.</li>
      <li>Feels and looks like real halo.</li>
      <li>It was not as described and the texter did not match my natural hair.</li>
      <li>Not something normally found at the local hair shop.  </li>
      <li>and I have a messy bun-like object that looks cool.</li>

    <li> The hair piece is a great price. It&#x27;s hard to tell the color on an iPhone , the color didn&#x27;t match my hair.</li>
    <li> Shinny synthetic look.  Can&#x27;t wear it as it has no natural look at all.</li>
    <li> I just ordered two more of these, so you know they&#x27;ve got to be good. They look a little more red in the picture, when in reality, they are more brown, but they match my hair ok. Many people compliment me when I wear these, which is practically every day because it&#x27;s so easy to have a nice hair day with these.</li>
    <li> Not much hair but for the price I can find something to do with it.</li>
    <li> Cute but mine came broken first time I used it!!!! Having a very hard time contacting the company, I just want it replaced! I waited Forever for it to arrive!!! :( Looks extremely fake. Too shiney.</li>
    <li> TOTALLY A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. JUST THROW IT TOGETHER AND SELL IT TO THE AMERICANS, THEY WILL BUY IT.  UNBELIEVEABLE!!</li>
    <li> Pretty flimsey, not the right color...I ordered brown and it is a medium auburn.Guess you get what you pay for...I ordered another elsewhere for twice as much and it is much better.</li>
    <li> I never wear stuff like this but I ordered this because it looked cute and it was only like $2! It looks awesome in my hair and matched perfect!</li>
    <li> this synthetic hair bun is great! it adds some shaZAM without any work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the color matched my own well enough and the image was accurate.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the fake plastic look of this. Wore it once and won&#x27;t wear it again. Garbage.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea but the fibers are just too shiny to be believable. I gave it to my cats-they love it!</li>
    <li> I ended up throwing this piece in the trash. It&#x27;s extremely thin, the hair looks like plastic, and the brown is not a natural tone for brown hair....its super shiny and impossible to blend with real hair.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey for the quality but the combination of colors are nice.  Not something normally found at the local hair shop.  Feels and looks like real halo.</li>
    <li> That little extra!  Great in a French twist or other up do.  Much better than the French twister out there that shows through</li>
    <li> Fell off my pony tail first time I wore it. The elastic band needs to be tighter.</li>
    <li> It is a good add on piece, especially if you have thinning hair at the crown. You can pull a ponytail through or half way through to build up a nice bun updo. I have dark long hair, I blend my hair over and around it into a two tone hairdo, looks pretty good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> It was not as described and the texter did not match my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I bought this but I love it. I can pull my hair back in a low ponytail, slap this thing on and I have a messy bun-like object that looks cool. It&#x27;s great for getting ready fast on a beach vacation.</li>
    <li> Too thin, and sheds too much. Not curly at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little too shiny for me.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair, when I use this I wear my hair up in a sort of modified french twist. very easy to use</li>
