<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it at night on my face. Love it!</li>
    <li> This oil has done wonders for my skin. My skin is combination/oily, with the main oily parts being around the T-zone area (so annoying). I have a few blackheads that have cleared using this oil. It is very lightweight, absorbs easily and leaves my skin feeling very smooth. I would definitely purchase this item again. I have also used this for an oil cleanse method (go on YouTube is you need more clarification) Thank me later!&lt;br /&gt;FYI: please read the label and refrigerate after opening. I enjoy the cooling sensation on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have had the opportunity to use this on my face and neck, and it does indeed dissolve almost instantly into my skin. It feels so refreshing, and there is not stinging or burning of any kind.  I have been using so many different skin products lately that I am not certain of the benefits of this specific product.  But it is clear that this is as good as any other quality skin product. The best thing about the product is its instant absorption.  I am all about reducing wrinkles, and I am confident that this will help over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something that I don&#x27;t like about the product but it&#x27;s very minor. The smell is not pleasing, and you have to store it in the refrigerator once you open it.  But these are minor irritations when you weigh the good with the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has a significant scar under one eye. She&#x27;s had the scar for 23 years and it was as healed as it was going to be but still very visible.  She used this oil three days before we witnessed with our own eyes the incredible effect it had on her scar. Two weeks later and with daily use, her scar is only barely visible at all! I&#x27;m over the moon about it and I bought one for my own use (don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet...but they&#x27;re coming!) And I keep my Yumi in the fridge so my application is a lovely cool few drops to refresh me in the morning.  If you&#x27;ve been skeptical in any way about the benefits and real results of the Ridership Oil by Yumi I have to tell...get it! Its worth it at any price.</li>
    <li> Very soothing for the face. GREAT quality, you can tell and feel it is 100% pure. Will be definitely buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this product doesnt irritate my skin in the littlest bit! I LOVE it and will definitely be buying more. Great product from a great seller!</li>
    <li> Product is excellent and is helping with the spots and discoloration on my daughter&#x27;s skin from blemishes, without irritation.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve only had this rose hip oil for about a week, I&#x27;m very impressed with the way it makes my skin feel. The effects are immediate and my skin feels smooth and soft after application. I&#x27;ll update later when I&#x27;ve had more time to use it.</li>
    <li> Works nice as a moisturizer</li>
    <li> I like the way it keeps my face moist</li>
    <li> Nice product! It has really helped me with my extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have to say it has an odor that is abit much for me when applying. So far Ive only used it 3 times as it kind of as stated has an odor I have to pass on. I wish it could maybe come in a more solid form instead of drops.</li>
    <li> Love this oil, works well with passion fruit oil and tightens your skin.  Really works!</li>
    <li> Love this oil .Makes my face feel softer.</li>
    <li> Love this oil for my skin</li>
    <li> I love the way this product makes me face feel. very happy with this oil. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Seems to work very well ! I use it mostly on my hands and I have noticed a big difference I have spent a small fortune on products for my hands and nothing worked . I also noticed the lines on my forehead are alot less noticeable . And can&#x27;t beat the price and shipping was very fast as well , I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> is very nice on my face and work with my sick. if you want your face to look good try rose hip oil</li>
    <li> Awesome product, smells great. I use it on my scalp before shampooing and it makes me hair soft, stops itching and my scalp feels worderful. I would defiantly purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully. Love the smell. It works beautifully to smooth out and heal your skin.</li>
    <li> My sister is the one who turned me on to rosehip oil. I had never heard of it before until she purchased a bottle for herself after claiming that Miranda Kerr swears by it. Not one to ever turn down potentially looking like Miranda Kerr, I had to get myself a bottle of rosehip oil as well. Admittedly, I was at first a bit wary of it since I have combination, acne-prone skin that can get oily at times. Knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive skin.    It was definitely not greasy as I expected it to be. It reminds me of tea tree oil, if you have ever used that. It&#x27;s far from greasy and is easily absorbent. I&#x27;ve been using it on an acne scar on the side of my face, and although it has only been a couple of days, I am already starting to see that the scar is fading away. I can&#x27;t wait to see if extended use will make it completely disappear. My sister loves her rosehip oil and now buys it before she even runs out just so she can always have a bottle by her side, so I have all the faith that this product will be amazing. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!    I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product - highly recommend product!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my girlfriend as an X-mas present. She claims she loves it and it works (absorbs easily and fast - feels good after). Remember to refrigerate it after the initial opening. I would not pay $40-50 for it, $15-25 is an acceptable price for those looking to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I love my oil, especially in this winter climate and dry radiator heat. Goes on easily, absorbs quickly, is not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;. I just wish it didn&#x27;t have to be refrigerated but I can live with it.  No chemicals, no alcohol, just a simple oil.</li>
    <li> So far I love it! I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 days but I&#x27;ve used other rosehip products in the past with amazing results! I always get tons of complements on my skin;)</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is amazing...........</li>
    <li> Great product. Didn&#x27;t really like the scent but it make my face feel very soft and give me that morning dewy glow. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I am using it at night for anti- aging and it&#x27;s working just like it said it would. I recommend the Rosehip Oil.</li>
    <li> The smell was terrible.  Can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Use this every morning with great results..</li>
    <li> This took my skin a small time to adjust (I have extremely sensitive skin) but in the last two weeks, my complexion has become very even and glowing~ really happy I ordered an extra bottle!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t have a rose scent to it, but used as both an eye makeup remover and a moisturizer for my face it was wonderful.  It didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, and it was gentle on my eye area.  I was able to remove my makeup easily and moisturize my eye area at the same time. I have also noticed that the fine lines near my eyes are harder to see.</li>
    <li> My very sensitive skin loves it, use as a nightly moisturizer. Gets absorbed quickly and does not stain. Helps with any redness and dryness, even dab a little around eyes. I  maintain in refrigerator for prolonged shelf life.</li>
    <li> I am currently going through menopause and I feel very dry and need more moisture.  This product absorbs quickly, there is no smell and I am hydrated.  After applying my face is smooth not sticky and it absorbs quickly.  Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I know the bottle states it, but make sure you store the oil in the fridge. I left it out for about a week or two (in my medicine cabinet) and it started to smell very bad. I&#x27;m not sure if the product is affected my being left at room temperature or not, but it still seems to be working. It leave my skin soft and it absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is is amazing!!</li>
    <li> Nice light oil. Leaves a smoothe feeling on skin without being heavy.</li>
    <li> works better on my hands than on my face</li>
    <li> the oil is too thick and I don&#x27;t like that it has to be refrigerated. the oil doesn&#x27;t absorb that well into the skin. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. I don&#x27;t care for it but I think its just my preference.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the rosehip oil for 2 weeks and I&#x27;m loving it so far.  My face is hydrated all day without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying this product for the first time and it is great.. It has a great feel in your hand and on your face.. My skin looks noticeably better.. I&#x27;m going to continue using this.. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift and my daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> Works and works well. I would recommend this product to anyone. High quality personal care!</li>
    <li> The texture can be a bit heavy, and I don&#x27;t like how it has to be stored in the Refrigerator, but it performs well on my skin.</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel great all day.  Was hoping redness would get better but still the same</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Rosehip Oil. This product is wonderful. I use it on my skin for dryness and it doesn&#x27;t leave heavy residue after use. It&#x27;s just perfect for skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with oils and I think I&#x27;ll keep this one in rotation! I have noticed that it does cause breakouts on some parts of my face (mostly cheeks), so I&#x27;ll keep using argan or coconut oil there, which don&#x27;t seem to have the same effect. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any major changes, but I do like how it absorbs quickly and keeps me feeling moisturized until morning (usually I wake up feeling really dry). It has to be kept in the fridge, which sometimes cause me to forget to use it when I&#x27;m getting ready for bed. It&#x27;s a really nice product though!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent but it absorbs nicely  and leave my face with a fresh dewy look.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Kinda smelly! Did not refrigerate immediately after opening, this was not clearly indicated when I first purchased this! I read some later reviews that stressed this. Too expensive to not clearly post this in the product! Probably won&#x27;t buy again... There is no expiration date on it either.</li>
    <li> BEST STUFF EVER! I only use this for my moisturizer. Red marks fading and gives me a glow without the shine. Item was mailed quickly. Will order again!</li>
    <li> My order of Yumi Beautiful Organic Rosehip Oil arrived on time, and I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week.  So far, this oil has not made my face break out, and I have hyper-sensitive skin.  Seriously.  Any small change in my cleansing/moisturizing routine typically results in a nice, big zit (or three).  I have oily skin to begin with, so using this rosehip oil seems counter-intuitive, however, I live in a part of the country where cold temps in winter wreak havoc with my skin.  I use this oil, along with organic jojoba oil, as part of my daily moisturizing routine.  It&#x27;s a great barrier against the elements.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It has been great for my acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> It made a lot of my scars lighten up on my face. Will probably buy some more soon. *update* why did this DOUBLE in price? I was going to buy it but now it&#x27;s too much. :/</li>
    <li> I keep this in the refrigerator and it feels so good on my face and the coolness of the oil helps with puffy eyes in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I love all the natural products on my face! I love using it when I derma roll. It gives me a soft feeling in my face.</li>
    <li> This oil is perfect it does not look oily on the skin and leaves it looking soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Rosehip oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about two weeks and notice a different in my skin tone.  My face is beginning to look more youthful.</li>
    <li> So far so good my face is beautiful . Around  my eyes are much brighter . lines around  my mouth going away .Love</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s face and really like it.  It is gentle and she likes the smell, and I can combine easily with other oils.</li>
    <li> Made me break out like crazy</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face and neck for over a week now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the softness of my skin. I&#x27;m 47 years old and my skin was looking dull so I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m happy that I did. My skin is so soft when I wake up in the morning and also hydrated. I only gave this 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and want to give it at least a full month.</li>
    <li> Yumi products are great. Good asset to any beauty regime.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27; t like the smell and the oil is thick</li>
    <li> Very good packaging and very good quality. I have had it for several months now and it has not spoiled or changed odors.</li>
    <li> Great product, I mix it with other natural oils and use it on my face and body,my skin is not only soft but I have seen an improvements in fine lines without using expensive creams. I keep it in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li> I can not rate good or bad because Ive only uses this oil for 3 days. It takes 45 days to see results from this kind of oil maybe longer.</li>
    <li> Like it, use on top of vitamin c serum nightly. Would buy again. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great.</li>
    <li> This is pure Rosehip Oil.  Yumi Beautiful works wonders on my acne-prone, dry skin.  Yumi was out of stock, and I reluctantly tried another brand.  It had a horrible smell and was way oilier.  I experienced horrible breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for bringing it back.</li>
    <li> I have a three inch scar that has hypertrophied but after only a week of applying this oil the swelling and redness are diminishing plus my face feels softer and am using a little less makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I saw a noticeable improvement in my skin and nails with one application. Works great under the eyes to hydrate and firm sagging skin. Feels oily when first applied but quickly absorbs and doesn&#x27;t lay on the skin. Wonderful product that I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Great oil. After reading reviews I was worried about the smell being bad. Initially there is a light smell but when you rub the oil in it goes away.it has lighted a few scars In a short time. I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> i use this under my moisturizer mixed with a little almond oil. The results have benn amazing!  I am 55 and have been struggling with skin tone issues as well as wrinkles and sagging skin. This has helped in all of those areas. I will Definitely continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> My daughter said this product did nothing</li>
    <li> Smells awful! I tried to use it but could not get over the rancid smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, will buy it again</li>
    <li> the best oil ever!!&lt;br /&gt;i bough this so more monts ago, and i have little bit less of the half bottle. i love to use it on my faceand hands when are very tire and stresse. it have a partucular smell, but goes away quickly!&lt;br /&gt;i will buy again soon</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I love how I wake up the next day and my face looks so radiant!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. I initially bought it in hopes of ridding my face of my acne scars, but there wasn&#x27;t a visible difference. It wasn&#x27;t too greasy for my oily combo skin and was absorbed fast. This product alone is not enough to keep my skin moisturized. My skin did look a little healthier and brighter, but other than that it didn&#x27;t really do anything. I probably won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> This organic serum is hands down amazing. I have dry skin and after a seriously long winter my skin needed a pick me up. I apply 4-5drops on the palm of my hand and use the other hands fingers to apply to my face and neck. I wake up and my skin is so nourished and glowy that I barely need any face makeup besides concealer. At first the smell bothered me, but I does disipate after application and I find I&#x27;ve gotten used to the scent. The days I&#x27;m too lazy too apply at night I regret it immediately, my makeup just seems to sit on my skin instead of look LIKE skin. I will be purchasing this on the regular, and at this price point it feels like a steal.</li>
    <li> Smell is a little strange at first. Moisturizing...but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Great rose aroma, arrived timely as promised. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very nice on the skin.  Not too oily and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff. Has amber color, indication of authentic pure raw cold-pressed rosehip oil. There is slight not so pleasant smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. The smell goes away after few minutes of applying it.  The oil is non-greasy and gets absorb really well.  I like the dropper it comes in.  I store my bottle in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.</li>
    <li> This is my second Yumi product, I also love their serum.  I have been using the rosehip oil once a day on my face for dryness and my skin is glowing.  I have also been using it on recent C-section scar, someone had recommended it for that and it is actually working to make my scar less noticeable.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love product, this is my second time purchasing</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Felt a difference in my skin in just days.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve even been using it on my arms to fade some scars and it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> Love this product My skin is softer and smoother already Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Beautiful oil and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I received this after linking to the promotion on Facebook. Normally I don&#x27;t trust too good to be true offers, but I figured since this was on Amazon I didn&#x27;t have much to lose but my $1. I had just run out of my rose hip oil that I bought at the local natural food market. So, in terms of the product, it is very nice. Seems to soak in very quickly and I am confident that it is a high quality product. The one drawback is that it needs to be refrigerated and discarded after 1 month. Since you are not ingesting this I can&#x27;t imagine that even if it is somewhat oxidized that it doesn&#x27;t have any benefits. I can understand if they say max benefits within 30 days and refrigerate for maximum effectiveness - but throw it away after 30 days??? Seems wasteful or a ploy to get people to use it up and order more. Refrigeration is also a pain. I am putting mine in the fridge which means I will use it less. Will take my chances after 30 days as well - I had my previous bottle of organic rose hip oil for much longer and still felt like it did its job. Won&#x27;t buy this in the future because of this issue - well, maybe if it another under $5 deal - but not for $16, can do better buying locally.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin feel awesome and look very moisturized not greasy when i wake up. I am glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! My skin looks and feels better after just using it a few times.</li>
    <li> I have been looking forward to trying out some rosehip oil for my dry skin, as well as for my long hair which has dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY needed some help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I did some research about how to best use rosehip oil for hair and skin, and what it&#x27;s best uses are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away I found quite a few webpages describing how wonderful rosehip oil is for your skin, so I was pretty excited to try some for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have rosacea, so I have to be careful what products I use on my skin, since it is all to easy to set off a reaction with the wrong type of skin product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the bottle and immediately noticed the mild yet very pleasant scent (a major bonus in my eyes!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going by what I read in various articles, I mixed a small amount with water in my hand, then spread it easily over my face after washing and rinsing my skin, and appreciated how clean and soft my skin felt afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I applied slightly warmed oil on the ends of my damp hair before washing it, and the result was surprisingly noticeable. Instead of the limp locks I had beforehand, I now had silky full of life hair...and I will be using this regularly from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a week and I have noticed that the fine lines around my eyes have improved.  The only downside for me is that my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb the oil and I feel like it sits on my face all night.  I have used other oils in the past and this hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  I will continue to use it and see if it&#x27;s just a fluke with my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product skin feels smooth.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any improvements while using this, it was a great deal but I honestly didn&#x27;t see a change in my skin. It did keep it moistured during the winter months though.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product!</li>
    <li> Added this to my home made skin care cream with great results</li>
    <li> Nice oil, absorbs quickly without greasy residue. I use it on my face and my hands. It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it affects the wrinkles I have around my eyes, but it is a good moisturizer. It has also worked wonders on my hands, especially the cuticles, which always seem to be dry.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil in my clay masques.</li>
    <li> Great for use at night, and to remove eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and have noticed a difference in my skin when I wake up in the morning. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> YUMI Certified Organic Rosehip oil has definitely made my face feel softer and healthier.I am glad to have tried this product and look very forward to being able to try one of their famous masks.</li>
    <li> Awesome gives your skin a nourished healthy look and velvety texture.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. After a week&#x27;s use my skin is softer and less blotchy. Especially at this time of year when I start to experience dry patches so highly recommend. I&#x27;m on the fence about the need for refrigeration as it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle. I put a few drops in my hand and wait for it to warm.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. From the first time I used it, I felt a difference on my skin. I am now addicted to it!</li>
    <li> I started using this a couple of weeks ago, and I have to be honest, the directions are written as a nightly serum and I typically don&#x27;t wash my face at night. That wouldn&#x27;t be a problem normally, but you also have to keep this refrigerated so I have been forgetting to use it every night! However, for the nights that I have used it, it does leave me with brightened and refreshed looking skin in the morning. It is very light and not very greasy at all. It usually takes only a couple of drops to cover my entire face (a little goes a long way). There is one thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars instead of 4 and that is the smell. To me it smells like mayonnaise but it disappears after a few minutes so it&#x27;s not that bad. Otherwise I think this is great!</li>
    <li> This product smells and looks exactly like what I paid over $ 30.00 for elsewhere. That would be because its exactly the same. I tried this on a special for $3.00 and now know where I will buy this oil from in the future! Shipped and arrived as promised as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this every night for two weeks and I really see an improvement in my skin. I will definitely buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> love it! it works for me</li>
    <li> I am a beauty blogger. A title I enjoy and feel blessed by but I must confess there are days when its not really glamorous. For example there are days when my skin is not always nice. You know those days when I use a product that damages my skin in some way. When they cause inflammation, redness, breakouts, rashes, and like this past week a huge mess. What do I rely on to tame my skin? To heal that inflammation and irritation? It&#x27;s Rose Hip Seed Oil. Here is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Yumi Beautiful Rose Hip Seed Oil. It is truly one of the best formulas I have found. It is a light formula that is easily absorbed into your skin for the highest ability to transform your skin. It transforms your skin with a gentle, natural, and the softest hydration. It is just so gentle for even the most sensitive of skins. It is a organic oil free of parabens, alcohol, and fragrance. Just a couple drops of this organic Yumi Rose Hip Seed Oil and your inflamed, dry, stretch marks, rough patches, and unbalanced skin is transformed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the only healing property I have found to balance my skin and bring it back to its natural glory before I made a mess of it. It is truly my beauty secret and I consider it one of my beauty product must haves. I encourage it to be yours as well.</li>
    <li> Have not had long enough to see any visible changes, but it feels soft on my skin</li>
    <li> Nice organic moisturizer.  I put it on before bedtime. Some people claim rosehip oil helps with rosacea, I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product made my sensitive facial skin break out.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try it on thicker skin, elbows etc to see if it is effective, if not I will need to return for refund.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to friends :) Try it out.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful! At first I was planning to buy Cocoa butter facial oil with Rosehips but ending up purchasing this and I&#x27;m very glad I did!  I&#x27;ve used this on my face nightly for the past 3 nights and can already see improvements!  My skin actually began looking brighter and fuller a few minutes after application!  It only takes maybe 10 drops total for my entire face, it absorbs perfectly, hydrates well,  feels silky on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a significant oily residue. I also like that its not a thin consistency serum, its a little thicker than an oil. I&#x27;m still prone to acne but it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause me any breakouts, in fact I think its helping to heal the acne I have as well as correct the dark areas on my face!  My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; I have with this product is the smell isn&#x27;t the best. I would describe it as an olive oil type smell. Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t linger!  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Started using it a month ago. It is not greasy and is helping with dark spots and making skin a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> I have been using Yumi Rosehip Oil for about a month. I have noticed the black circles under my eyes are completely gone. My skin is much brighter. I will have to continue use for another month before I will be able to see any difference in the black acne scars. I have a lot under my chin and along the bottom of my face. They are extremely dark and some are very old. So, I know it will be a while before I will see a significant difference. All in all, I&#x27;m loving this product. My skin is so soft after each use. I have only been using it once a day. My lips have also lightened a little. I&#x27;m a smoker so my lips have darken over the years but I&#x27;ve noticed they are lightening a great deal. I hope this product will completely get rid of the acne scars this winter because I would love to go without make-up next summer.</li>
    <li> This oil is very nice. I mix with my night cream and I can really tell a difference. My skin is softer and the fine lines are diminishing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing.. It leaves a lasting moisture to the skin.. I will use it always.</li>
    <li> Love this product, perfect for my winter dry skin!</li>
    <li> THis product is good no doubt about it, but u have to know how much and when to use it. I am giving 4 stars coz I had 2 different experience with this product. I have acne prone skin (combination) and when I got this product I had few active acne on my face. I used this product for 3 nights in a row but I dont know what I was doing wrong I was breaking out more. then I decide not to use this on my face on 4th night and I applied acne spot treatment on active ones. Next day morning I found my acne better so then I realized I must be doing something wrong or this product just simply not working for me. Still I wanted to use this product as I read lot of good reviews about acne scarring etc. So after taking two days break I gave it a shot again and this time I use it little differently. I freshly cleansed my face with gentle cleanser (cetaphil) , then I used little amount of gentle scrub(st Ives) then I used apple cider vinegar as my toner . After following my nightly routine I waited for few minutes  then spray some cold tap water (via spray bottle I have) just enough to damp my face little bit and finally I applied 2 drops of rosehip seed oil just by patting on my face instead of rubbing. I dries up so quickly that you won&#x27;t feel sticky after a while.  After applying the rosehip oil I just applied my acne spot treatment just on the active acne and the next morning my skin was thanking me for the moisture and no new breakout (WOW) I understood that I was probabley using it more in quantity or may be rubbing it in or whatever the reason was. Now I know how it works on my skin though its a long process to follow befor going to bed I prefer it doing before I get too tired and just want to sleep so that I dont miss any step.  Long story short this product works provided you use it in limit and yes its not a miracle product which can fade your scar overnight , it takes time. I have been using it regularly from last 2 weeks and I dont see drastic change but yes I see littlebit of fading on my post acne marks. Hopefully buy end of the month I can see more changes on my skin. I just wish if they can provide more information on the packaging.  I would recommend rosehip oil    19th Feb 2015 # review update   So I have used this product will all dedication as mentioned in my previous review, but I am compelled to update my review after experiencing some issues with this product. I used it 4 weeks continuously and I didn&#x27;t see any difference on my skin acne scars infact I started getting cystic acne more on my face which is definitely no one wants to see. I have stopped using rosehip oil for a while and I feel little relieved from the acne which occured all of a sudden after use of this product. I am not sure whether this one unit was wrong or what. But I am not at all happy with this product. I always kept this in refrigerator as suggested but something is wrong. I am still giving it 2 stars just because I like it on first place cause of its moisturizing effect but for acne scars its a  big no no and if you have oily skin pls dnt go for it. You may end up getting more acne like me. Really sad. And I have more  than half of the bottle left. I am not sure what I am going to do with that stuff anymore. May be I&#x27;ll try to use it on my hand and legs as moisturizer but definitely  not on FACE.  I hope if my comment have helped any 1 out there.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. My face looks and feels great!!</li>
    <li> This smells horrible! It smells like samon fish oil and the smell wont leavr my hands.  Ive washed them over 25 times...</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that they recommend refrigeration, so it is harder for me to remember to apply. Anyone had luck skipping the fridge?</li>
    <li> Smells like cooking oil!!! Gross.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I use it every night before I go to bed. It is a great bargain and fast shipping thank you for introducing me to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for using &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my already oily older face, but I decided to give this Rosehip Oil by YUMI a try. I&#x27;ve been using it NOT consistently (since it&#x27;s in the fridge and I don&#x27;t always remember!) - probably 3 or 4 nights a week for the past 3 weeks - the last few days, I&#x27;ve been noticing that my skin is smoother and more glowing and the wrinkles are fading - WOW!!!! Thank you, YUMI, for allowing us to try this product as a sampler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was just reading some of the other reviews on this product - and can&#x27;t wait to try it on other areas besides my face to combat scars and dry skin!!!!!</li>
    <li> very soft and absorbing</li>
    <li> I enjoyed my night blend of oils. I&#x27;ve used Yumi organic essential oil in my blend. I guess, mainly the retinoic acid (Vit A) in this oil makes my skin refreshed, bright and renewed. The only thing I did not like is the smell of this oil. But, when you blend it with other oils and with a few drops of essential oils (such as rose) it&#x27;s not disturbing at all. Much cheaper and healthier than mainstream cosmetics! Just a few drops is enough.</li>
    <li> I like this oil. I use it as an intense night moisturizer on my face, or mix with argan oil to make an everyday lighter moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smelt horrific. Ended up returning this product. Literally smelt like dead fish!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping.  I like it so far.  I have not used it long enough to post results.  It is easy to apply and feels nice on the skin however I can not say yet that it has made a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> The best skin oil on the market! You will see results in a few days.</li>
    <li> #Yumi Beautiful- an organic rose hip seed oil.  This oil is a hydrating serum that is for all skin types.  I looked at the box when it arrived and it was very eye appealing.  It comes in a white box with pink and rose tones on the top.  I also really like the name.  I have to admit, this whole oil serum thing was anew experience for me.  It comes in a bottle with a dropper and you have to be careful as it flows freely.  It is definitely a brown, oily color and I was not impressed with the scent.  It almost reminded me of a doctor&#x27;s office or ear drops- I know gross- right!!  Anyway, I had to try it and I have to admit it went on very smoothly and did make my skin feel soft and supple.  Who knows?  Maybe after using it for a while, it will grow on me!</li>
    <li> This oil is light and wonderful for skin. My daughter and I use it every morning and it is quickly absorbed. My daughter, who has combination oily skin, loves it and says she looks younger because her skin tone is more even.  She&#x27;s 15! Unfortunately I can&#x27;t say I look any younger, but I do love this oil. It comes in the perfect size to stay fresh.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.&lt;br /&gt;good for hair, acne scar, stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;Affordable and fast shipping too</li>
    <li> A great product. I would buy again! Thanks for the offer and opportunity to try this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is some amazing Rosehip oil.  It is great for the face, for scars and the like.  It absorbs quick and leaves the skin very soft.  :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so I was skeptical as to whether I would be able to use this or see any benefit....I was pleasantly surprised!! It is an oil but it smooths on and absorbs fairly well, but leaves my skin feeling and looking dewy. I use only at night (package recommends night use anyway). Been using for about 1.5 weeks and skin appears more refreshed looking.  I&#x27;ve even put some on the ends of my hair (very long and ends are dry) and love how that has helped there too!  Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> It has made such a diffrence. Love it.</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil is not at all greasy like you would think it may be. It does into your skin after rubbing it in. My aunt actually has been using rosehip oil for years and she told me many amazing results that would happen after using it for awhile. So i was very excited to try it. I use many different oils on my face and so far this is another oil i till add to my weekly routine of skincare. I have a few scars i have started using it on and already i see a difference in texture of my skin and looks.</li>
    <li> I thought the packaging was really pretty and the oil feels good on my hands but when I put it on my face, which is why I purchased this oil, I was disappointed in the smell.  It smells too much like fish oil. I put it on my face a couple times but decided to just use it on my hands.  I cant use perfumes but perhaps an added essential oil to help with the scent may help.</li>
    <li> Feels good on skin and makes it soft and smooth. Wish it had a better smell.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been really enjoying this oil. It us very light weight and absorbs after about 5 to 10 mins. Many oils take a while to absorb and just sit on your face. And you don&#x27;t need very much, this 1oz bottle should last a while. I believe  this would be a nice addition to your nightly moisturizing regiment or use it alone. You will still enjoy the benefits.</li>
    <li> I have always used Argon Oil. This oil goes beyond what Argon Oil can do. I noticed in 2 days my neck lines fading away. My face seemed firmer. At first, I thought it was my imagination, but using this oil nightly I really do see remarkable changes. I will continue use until bottle is empty,then I will buy another. If you want to see what a huge difference the right oil can make...try it, you will love the results. What have you got to lose....a few wrinkles????</li>
    <li> This a miracle oil used rosehip once before but never this good more than happy i am greatful...&lt;br /&gt;Will be using it every day</li>
    <li> I never heard of Yumi but I thought I would take a chance and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added Yumi Rosehip Oil to my regular moisturizer and I love it!  Just a few drops and it goes on smoothly, makes my skin look brighter, kind of a young and dewy look.  Although it is an oil, it isn&#x27;t oily or greasy -- very light.  A welcome addition to my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> Love the oil-Love the name!  I immediately started using this on my &amp;#34;alligator skin&amp;#34; elbows-it is smoothing out the skin!  I just read where it is helpful for scars.  I have a drawn, tight horrible scar on my hand-I just now put it on the scar. It looks and feels better already. It is painful to look at this scar, even after 30 years. Go figure.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with keeping the Rosehip Oil in the frig-my bathroom counter is already cluttered and this helps me remember to use it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the product!  I feel it is something I can afford &amp; continue to use. Kind of like my &amp;#34;use for everything coconut oil&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> VERY VERY SATISFIED!!</li>
    <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars is that you need to refrigerate.  My bathroom is upstairs and my refrigerator is downstairs.  I know it sounds like laziness but I like the convenience of having the product more accessible in my bathroom.  Now besides that, the product is pretty cool.  I just started using it and notice that my face is more hydrated.  It wasn&#x27;t sticky or tacky and not much of a smell to it either.  I also started using it on my cuticles which look much better instantly.  You can also use this product on your hair.  My hair is pretty fine, so no oils allowed.  But my mothers hair is sooo dry and super frizzy.  It made her hair look much more smooth when I used it on her.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  for sun spots (daily use of an extended period of time), wrinkles, premature aging, nails and hair, 100% organic, paraben, alcohol, dye and fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Refrigerate after opening!!!</li>
    <li> If you are like me and have been looking for food, drinks and even facial products that are made with natural, organic ingredients, you will like this YUMI Beautiful Organic Rose Hip Oil for your face. I have been using this for about two weeks now and really see the difference in the smoothness of my skin. It really makes a difference when a facial product is cold pressed, like this Rose Hip Oil is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an even more beautiful face, this facial skin care product will, indeed, hydrate both women an men&#x27;s skin. If one is looking to keep their skin flawless and possibly reduce any wrinkles or scars, the Vitamin A &amp; C included in the organic ingredients will also reduce any environmental issues anybody&#x27;s skin faces on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cold-pressed, Chile made Rose Hip Seed Oil, has been made the ECO Certified Organic way. so for the face and neck, for both women and  me alike. This Rose Hip Seed Oil is also naturally paraben, alcohol, and fragrance free. Also, this Rose Hip Seed Oil will lessen any appearance of scars, fine lines and even stretch marks. Oh, thre are many other ways this skin care product will make the face remain or look younger as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product ! Fast shipping !</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I found this!  My face felt tighter after the first use.  Now it&#x27;s soft and my pores are not so visible.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll improve with continued use.  I&#x27;m never gonna stop using it!</li>
    <li> Excellent! Nice packaging and it works great! Using for brown spots on my hands!</li>
    <li> I just received mine and can&#x27;t wait to start using it</li>
    <li> feels very nice on the skin</li>
    <li> Good product, making a difference</li>
    <li> Works really well as a moisturizer without a oily or greasy feeling.  Skin has a natural glow.</li>
    <li> Really like this oil for all over use. The scent is a bit unpleasant, however the scent doesn&#x27;t linger after you rub it in. It also works wonderfully added to a perfumed lotion.</li>
    <li> good product! I use it every day!</li>
    <li> quality made rose hip oil</li>
    <li> I love the product. Skin feel supple and smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night, and love it.  It absorbs quickly, does not have a strong scent, works well under makeup or alone, and is soothing to very dry skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good right the first use, making skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I love this product, I wear after a shower and my skin is clear and soft. Now that is getting colder my face was feeling dry but after I started using Yumi rosehip oil it feels great!</li>
    <li> I have been using Rose Hip Oil by Yumi for a few weeks.  So far I do not see any considerable differences in my skin or my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply it, my face glows and my hands definitely shine.  I use it twice a day on my face.  Yumi Rose Hip Oil has several benefits.  Like the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic, cold-pressed rose hip oil is a natural source of antioxidants, Vitamin C, and Trans-Retinoic Acid (a type of vitamin A that retinol converts to).&lt;br /&gt;What you&#x27;ll love about Rose Hip Oil is how beautifully and easily it absorbs into your skin to help keep your skin hydrated and elastic, minimizing the appearance of flaws.&lt;br /&gt;* Bring vitality to dehydrated, sensitive and mature skin.&lt;br /&gt;* Reduce the appearance of scars, stretch marks and fine lines over time.&lt;br /&gt;* Perfect for environmental stressors that can lead to wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;* Awesome as a spot treatment for discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that after using it over a period of time, I will see some of the above benefits.  I should mention that I do not have a lot wrong with my skin, but I believe there is always room for improvement.  Usually when using a new skincare product,  I notice a brightness that does minimize the appearance of flaws either the next day or within a couple of days.  I have not noticed to much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my nails I am not quit sure what I should be experiencing.  I apply the oil on my hands, because I like the nice shine that it gives my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yumi Rose Hip Oil seems to have ingredients that are beneficial to everyday skincare.  Keeping that in mind I will continue to use the product until the bottle is empty and hope to see some results by then.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Please see my review at my website: https://splendourdivaqueen.blogspot.com/b/post-preview?token&#x3D;qiIufkkBAAA.6IdidhQZjTP9c_aYRGyXoA.5uAkvJXWszzg_d5OaWdJTQ&amp;postId&#x3D;3258593079229744448&amp;type&#x3D;POST#!/2014/11/rose-hip-oil-review-by-yumi-beautiful.html&lt;br /&gt;Great product and will give you the results.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this rosehip oil...will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> First before I talk about the product I want to mention the beautiful design on the label and box. Just that alone would probably want you to choose this over anything else. It is a beautiful girly design that is a pleasure to look at. On to the Oil, I love the way this feel and smells. To me it smells like fresh tea which is something I personally like. I use 2-3 drops to my hand and then blend all over my face and neck. I keep this on at my bed side so I can apply it right before bed. This give my other face products time to set in before my Rose Hip oil. When I wake up I feel my face smoother and have been loving the results. I received this to review, however it does not effect my review.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of using rose hip oil. Love roses in any way, shape or form!</li>
    <li> Nice and light oil.  Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I haven&#x27;t noticed the reduced scaring benefits as of yet, but it does soften and moisturize. I like to alternate between this and coconut oil depending on skin dryness with changes of seasons.</li>
    <li> This is a great dry oil. I use it twice a day and after chemical peels. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Used twice and made me breakout a little on my cheek bones.  Haven&#x27;t had a pimple in 25 yrs.  Will continue to use to see if it works though.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  I have been a long time organic coconut oil user for my skin and will continue to use that on my body, however, this rosehip oil is now my favorite choice for face and cuticles.  *dramatically improved cuticles was a surprise result from simply rubbing what was leftover in my hand into my cuticles after my face.  Even my husband, who usually does not notice subtle differences, remarked at how my face seemed to be glowing lately and my nails look much prettier.  That obviously is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like (but can still live with), is the product needing to be refrigerated after opening.  It is completely understandable and I much rather that than chemical preservatives.  I just keep forgetting to grab it when I need it and always have to go back for it (and then back again to put it up).</li>
    <li> A light oil, I&#x27;ve used vitamin E oil very heavy this was wonderful and it&#x27;s absorbed very quickly on your face.  And I wake to my face being very soft not dry. I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product!! I have been using this for close to a month now and my skin is so soft. It has brighten the dark spots and my fine lines are disappearing. My skin tone is more even now and I love it. Thank you so very much for this product!!!</li>
    <li> Order arrived very quickly! No damage to package. I&#x27;ve been using for a little over a week and it&#x27;s been good on my skin, I topped using all other products for a few days so I could get a good idea of its potential . I have dry weatherd skin from living in northern Vermont . It goes on easily spreads nicely and isn&#x27;t leaving my skin greasy , so far so good no breakouts in my skin which important to me, my husband says I&#x27;m glowing ! Nice ! Compliments like that go far after 23 years of marriage !  This is my opinion and if you decide to try it I would recommend going free of make up and other lotions and chemicals, I just prefer to know what it does without inter fence from other products , but the decision is solely yours, I will buy again as winter is always harsh on the skin, I may apply more through out the day depending on the weather. I hope this helps in any decision you make.</li>
    <li> I love it. I received it in a timely manner. I&#x27;ve been using it a week now and I&#x27;m noticed changes</li>
    <li> when I used it it made my skin soft , not greasy . I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my wrinkles yet but I have only used it about  10 times.</li>
    <li> So far I am pleased.  I have been only using it a week, but it soaks in nice, I&#x27;ve been using it at night before bed.  Others have commented on the smell, I think it smells like vitamin C tablets personally.  Which is not entirely bad, dose not smell rancid.  Arrived on time, packaged well.</li>
    <li> I keep forgetting to use it because it has to be refrigerated and it has a very strong smell.  Maybe it is becaus eit is refrigerated.</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say, it did nothing for me. I used it faithfully as stated.</li>
    <li> Yes I have a question? Why can&#x27;t you use RoseHip oil after 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I use this oil at night, by itself or with a moisturizer. It makes my skin so soft and feels amazing. I have sensitive skin and have had no problem with this Rosehip oil at all.</li>
    <li> I am new to using oils and I purchased this one for my skin. I have only used it for a few days but the skin seems softer already.</li>
    <li> This product is really great. It&#x27;s not greasy like you may think. It quickly absorbs in to your skin leaving it feeling silky smooth. I love that it is full of vitamins and antioxidants. I have been adding a few drops to my conditioner to help my dry hair. I have noticed that my hair is silkier and softer. I also love to use this on my cuticles. I have the worse dry cuticles. I constantly put lotions on my hands because of this. I have since been adding some of this Rose Hip Oil to my lotions too. It leaves my skin feeling so soft. I will be making some of my own lotion with this oil soon. I have noticed that it&#x27;s best to keep the bottle refrigerated. Even though I did receive this bottle in exchange for my review, I really do love this and I am excited to try and make some beauty products with this. I will definitely keep using this on my hair and nails. It&#x27;s a great opportunity to try this product because Yumi Beautiful is backing their product with a 100% risk free, money back guarantee. You really have nothing to lose by trying it. You will absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Only been using this for a week and can already feel improvement in my skin. I have very sensitive skin due to medical issues and medication and this oil has been wonderfully moisturising without any irritation. I store it in the refrigerator and love the coolness when applied. Not at all oily and absorbs immediately into my skin. Love it and will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> With a gorgeous amber color and an earthy scent, Y&amp;uuml;mi Love It Beautiful 100% Pure Natural Rose Hip Oil (click link to purchase) is an extremely versatile product.  It can be used to soothe, soften, and hydrate your skin, hair, and nails.  This oil is cold pressed, virgin botanical oil from the Southern Andes Mountains in Chile is certified organic and 100% pure.  It doesn’t contain any additives, paraben, alcohol, dye, and is fragrance-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is labeled as a hydrating serum, the first thing that I did was try this on my face before I went to bed.  For me, this was a big mistake.  I have combination skin that tends more to the oily side and it was much too oily for my face.  I got three large and deep blemishes that I had to treat.  My suggestion would be that you use rose hip oil on your face if you don’t have oily skin already.  Lucky for me, I have some great sulfur soap to help me clear up those nasty blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I tried was to use it on my driest skin which happens to be my hips.  Lotions and creams just don’t do a good job at relieving the horribly dry skin there.  But this rose hip oil relieves the itching quickly and without the greasy feel of other oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a wonderful oil to rub into your hands cuticles, and nails before your go to bed so it can moisturize your skin overnight.  It’s also a great way to moisturize your feet.  The rose hip oil absorbs into the skin in less than five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love your skin with Y&amp;uuml;mi Love It Beautiful 100% Pure Natural Rose Hip Oil today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Smells a little stinky, But that disappears right after its applied, Thank you...</li>
    <li> very nice oil , fresh , and absorbs into skin easily . hoping for a chemical burn scar to improve with use .. we&#x27;ll see , but in the mean time , my skin loves it .</li>
    <li> Great for retaining our beautiful faces!!</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it at night and it feels great on the skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily... Very hydrating!</li>
    <li> The YUMI brand is pretty good and I&#x27;m glad I got a chance to try it out! Good price so will definitely recommend to others! This oil smells awesome lol</li>
    <li> This is my favorite brand for rosehip oil.  I love how soft and glowy my skin feels the next morning.  I also use it as a moisturizer when my skin is dry and flaky. Negatives: smell and it&#x27;s price.  But i think it&#x27;s a good bargain compared to everything else! !!</li>
    <li> Rosehip oil is derived from roses. full of boosting vitamin A, vitamin C and the essential fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6.The rose hip oil absorbs quickly and cleanly for a mess-free finish.The  vitamin A is known to promote healthy skin cell and rejuvenate the skin,it also helps repair skin damage made by the sun and other toxins. This product gives you all the great benefits for your face and skin but the added bonus is that it promotes healthy nail growth healthy cuticles and lessens breakage and hang nails. If there is one thing we need in our busy lives it is a multi purpose product this reduces some of the time and steps required in your daily routine giving you more time to spend with your family and making your daily health and beauty routine less of a chore. I love this product and have had great results. There is nothing better then a mess free product that actually works.</li>
    <li> I have dry and sensitive skin and this has helped improve it so much. I love this product it absorbs quickly and keeps my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much. Use it every night. Make sure you refrigerate after opening. Does not feel real cold on my face</li>
    <li> My wife love these product lines and buying for our relatives.</li>
    <li> Gave 3 stars because it takes time to get used to the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent. Otherwise it does a nice job moisterizing the face, neck and chest area. Works well with other products.</li>
    <li> I love this. I put this on my face before my cream.  It seems to make my small lines invisible.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I initially thought the bottle&#x27;s contents were possibly rancid, as I was expecting a rosy scent, which is not there; but, then I realized it&#x27;s more like the scent of rose hip tea, so the oil smells like a combination of a tea bag and cooking oil.  The oil itself is a pleasant, light-weight oil, that absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;d been applying it overnight, and in the morning I just rinse my face with water, and the faint scent tends to stay with me throughout the day.  That cooking oil smell.  One should definitely use a face wash in the morning if they are using it overnight so the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on you throughout the next day.</li>
    <li> I am still using this product, this product seem oily but after you apply it to the skin it dries up. I like it and I can see a difference in my skin texture and many of my skin spots are clearing up. I did not know that you had to keep it in the refrigerate after opening it, but you do. No, problems it still works okay.</li>
    <li> amazing product love it works greaat with my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Every beauty cabinet should include this stuff.  Great for reducing pores.  Works well mixed with EOs.  Will buy again and again.  Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Intially I thought it smelled like vegatable oil so I didn&#x27;t use it for a while. But I recently have been mixing it with some coconut oil and I really do like it!</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful - i use it right after an evening exfoliating scrub &amp; it soaks right into my skin over night leaving it with a beautiful glow in the morning - LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Yumi makes a great product. This stuff is cold pressed from the seeds of rose bushes predominately grown in Chile. Full of vitamin, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate your skin. Because it is cold pressed it retains more of the nutrients. Do not expect this to smell like a rose. It doesn&#x27;t. The smell is the only reason I did not give this 5 stars. I will still use it and wouldn&#x27;t want any artificial ingredients but honestly the smell is a turn off. Having said that, I will keep using the stuff because it works so well. I used this on my dry fingers and overnight they were better. It is an oil but it blends in very well. I have very sensitive skin. I&#x27;m fair skinned and have freckles. I&#x27;ve been using this on my crows feet and dry spots before bedtime. So far its been very hydrating and seems to fill in my small lines. When I get up, my skin looks more radiant and youthful. I&#x27;m 47 so this is a must. Generally, I shy away from oils as they tend to clog pores and feel heavy. This stuff is amazing because it absorbs quickly and I don&#x27;t feel greasy. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin look really nice.</li>
    <li> I received one bottle of Yumi Beautiful Rosehip Oil to review!  I absolutely love this oil!  My skin has never looked this good, so I would highly recommend it!  It has reduced the fine lines in my face.  It&#x27;s the perfect antidote for sore sensitive skin.  It easily absorbs into your skin and keeps it very well hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this oil is that it&#x27;s all natural, PLUS it&#x27;s paraben, alcohol and fragrance FREE!  Rosehip Oil is considered a godsend, due to the fact that it makes skin appear younger and more luminous!  Just think, an organic oil like this can reduce the appearance of scars, stretch marks and fine lines.  It has worked wonders for me, so what are you waiting for, give this precious oil a try and see for yourself how beautiful your skin will look!  You can use it on your face, skin, hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I noticed that after a few days my skin seemed brighter and smoother,  and the fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead appeared less visible.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Has transformed my skin! Bright and radiant skin replaces dull skin just after a few weeks use. Has helped minimize breakouts and faded old acne scars. I am a believer in this product!</li>
    <li> Love this oil! It is a bit on the heavy side so a little is all you need, and I use it only at night, but I wake up the next morning and I can feel a difference. It also heals my blemishes faster. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i didnt know what to really expect when i got this, but once i started using it i liked it. Decent sized bottle thats come with the dropper for easy use. Smell is normal as i&#x27;ve been reading about but thats the only thing i dont like.</li>
    <li> This oil has a nice smell.  It absorbed into the skin leaving the skin smooth and not oily.  I used it on my hands, face and neck.</li>
    <li> still working with this product, loved it on my hair&lt;br /&gt;review here&amp;#62; http://effortlesslyhunni.blogspot.com/2014/10/hey-hunnibees-i-recently-got-to-try-out.html&lt;br /&gt;Also used it on my lips and nails, I&#x27;m currently looking for a way to carry around small amounts so I can look naturally cute at school! I mix this in my oil rinse for my hair post-shampoo as well. Great all around light oil.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price - sold!  Update - changed review results downgrade- Still love the product, just not the 60% price increase in a year!  Does Martin Shrekli work at this firm too?</li>
    <li> Love it. My go to gift for all the women I know, for any occasion. Amazingly pure, absorbs into skin, and leaves me look refreshed when I wake up, I massage it while my eyes are closed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> After reading about the positive effects of rosehip oil, I decided to give it a try in hopes of diminishing a couple dark spots and minor scar on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it as a nightly moisturizer after my normal skin care routine. After only a week, my skin feels super soft and healthy. I&#x27;m looking forward to (hopefully) seeing some improvement on my dark spots and scar after a few months, but even if I don&#x27;t, this is still a lovely (and affordable!) nightly moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this it has helped with my dry skin and some of the spots I have in my face. Seeing some of the other reviews I will start to use it on my other dry areas of my body.  I&#x27;m very excited to see the continued results!!</li>
    <li> To me, my skin is bad. I regularly get pimples and blackheads and buildup on my nose which is hard to get rid of. I have dark spots/acne scars all along my cheeks, chin, between my nose and upper lip and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I was wary about it at first because my skin usually reacts badly to oil but I just tried it anyway. I used it on a little spot at first but then I decided to just go all out and use it all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;And that was the best thing I have ever done in my life. This product turned my skin from dull, dry, flakey and lifeless to soft, dewy, glowy and moisturized. I&#x27;ve had it for seven days and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I know it&#x27;s going to take a while for the scarring to start to disappear but I feel so much more confident without make up now. I use it morning and night - as a moisturizer - and it&#x27;s like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I recommend this product, even just to try. It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use. I am in love with this product. i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion. Definitely will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It absorbs great into the skin. This oil keep me sensitive skin under control. The best cold pressed oil.</li>
    <li> love this product highly recommend</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to review for my blog GlamRiver.  I have been using it for about a week now.  If you have ever used Rosehip Oil you know that it has a very distinct (sometimes unpleasant) scent but I found that this oil was not as strong some other brands which was a huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;The oil if very lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin leaving it soft, smooth and moisturized but not greasy.  I can&#x27;t wait to see all the benefits after continued use since Rosehip Oil is known for it&#x27;s abilities to help reduce scarring, wrinkles and make skin luminous!  The ONLY downside is having to keep it refrigerated, other than that it&#x27;s a choice!</li>
    <li> Feels nice on the skin,not to oily and the product absorbs well.I haven&#x27;t used it enough times to cure being 63.But I like what it&#x27;s doing for me so far.</li>
    <li> I like that I&#x27;m not putting something on my skin that I have to worry about. I have a lot of allergies. This oil is paraben free, alcohol free, dye and fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the box it says that this is used for your face, and neck area. You can apply to your feet, hands, nails, and put a couple drops in your conditioner. There are more uses to this Rosehip Oil than I thought. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it while it&#x27;s on sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get this product for review. I&#x27;m a professional blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the packaging and you get a lot product for the price. Give an A+ for the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly was surprised by the smell but I know it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s natural so that&#x27;s probably why it has that fish oil tablet smell to it. (That&#x27;s the best way I can describe the smell.) Thankfully, the smell does not linger on after a while. If you have a very sensitive nose then you may be put off by the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how you don&#x27;t need much product to apply for the face, at least two drops is good enough but if you have a big face like me than you may need three drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing and light on the face so you don&#x27;t feel super oily. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of days but I can tell it will help me with my dry patches on my face in the long run. The first time using it was at night time and when I woke up, I did  see that my face looked a little brighter which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only downside is having to keep it in the refrigerator and also I would love them to add an expiration date on it so I know when it will go bad. Nonetheless, I think its a lovely product for all women of any age and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who wants to try a 100% organic rose hip oil.</li>
    <li> an excellent product for softening and moisturizing the skin</li>
    <li> I love this rose hip oil!  Smells so earthy and leaves my skin fresh and moisturized. Glass bottle with dropper is so convenient to use. I use it as a moisturizer in the night or mix it with another carrier oils for my body. I truly recommend to get this organic skin rejuvenator!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.  Nice product, has a little off putting smell, but that fades very quickly.  Only time will tell if it works as they say.</li>
    <li> My skin gets softer and healthier by the say.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> This may be  the best natural product i have used on my face yet! Not only did it arrive sooner than expected, it delivered in quality too. I have been battling with acne for years. And most recently have had a really bad episode. I can honestly say that i have seen a huge improvement in the quality of my skin. In just two weeks time! Ived used it only as a night serum. My regimine also combines it with a natural soap. My skin responds really well to this conbination. I absolutely love this product! And it is doing just as the company says the product will do. I am happy.</li>
    <li> love this stuff and how it makes my face feels so smooth</li>
    <li> Except for the bad odor of the product (which maybe due to the way it is packed directly from nature), I think it works. I have normal skin, purchased to decrease the pore size on my nose, it works I can say!</li>
    <li> I really have mixed feelings about this oil. The first time I purchased it I. Was. Amazed. It wasn&#x27;t light, per se, but it absorbed beautifully into my skin. I used it as a night treatment and as a part of my oil cleansing routine for about a month before I started using it in conjunction with retin a. And if you use retin a you know you&#x27;ve just become a hot, peeling, mess, and this oil is the only thing that restored luster to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;And then I ran out.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I purchased more of this miracle salve and when it arrived I opened it immediately and that&#x27;s where the trouble started.&lt;br /&gt;It smelled.&lt;br /&gt;Like, horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Really, really, horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Like old fish grease.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I was disturbed but I used it anyway figuring the smell would dissipate during my oil cleansing routine. It didn&#x27;t. I could not sleep because the smell was literally sitting on my skin. So much to my despair I sent it back for a refund. I would love to buy it again but not when they have fluke bottles like that circulating around. I will search for another brand though, because I officially love rosehip seed oil.</li>
    <li> This is a nice addition to your skincare collection. It really hydrates and gives you a glow. A little goes a long way. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I received mine 3 days ago and started using it right away at night. The smell takes a little getting used to, but my skin feels amazing in the morning. Will definitely continue to use it and buy it for my daughters</li>
    <li> Rosehip Seed Oil, and most other non-mineral oils are not greasy and will not make you break out. This oil does not leave your skin greasy, and makes your skin feel smooth and radiant. With 2 weeks of use I can already see a difference in my skin and I had no breakouts. The only drawback, it has to be refrigerate after opening, which is a bit of an inconvenience. Also the shelf life is only 4 weeks. However, the benefits for the skin far outweigh these inconveniences. I will definitely recommend to my friends and anyone who needs a better looking skin.    *Please note that I was sent this product complementary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> I just recently got this and have to say I love the first results! I use this at night and immediately my face drank it in and looked different! But when I woke up in the morning...my face actually looked healthy instead of tired! First impressions like that are a very good sign! This will be my nightly routine from now on! I&#x27;m 57 and I&#x27;m at the age where my skin needs a nurishing boost! Love this!</li>
    <li> The package arrived on the date promised.  I have tried other Rosehip Oil products and I am definitely not disappointed in Yumi!  Absolutely love it! I will definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> for me, it didn&#x27;t work, itchy and doesn&#x27;t absorve, and smell rancid.</li>
    <li> First of all, it has a strong scent. It&#x27;s on the musky side. With time and usage, the smells becomes less noticeable. Secondly, it comes in a dropper. I have full control of the quantity I want to pump. It&#x27;s also sanitary safe. Third, the oil doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly but it&#x27;s actually good in a way. It&#x27;s always good to massage your skin. It&#x27;s good for blood circulation. I know other reviews said it&#x27;s not greasy. It&#x27;s not completely greasy but it does leave a slight greasy feel to my skin. It&#x27;s not bothersome at all. It gives my skin some glow to it, as well as, a youthfulness. Lastly, it&#x27;s very hydrating.</li>
    <li> I recently was given an opportunity to try Yumi Rose Hip Oil.  I&#x27;ve found it does make a noticeable difference in my skin.  The company chose the right size packaging for shipment and the item arrived intact.  My biggest complaint?  The need to keep the the oil in the refrigerator as I have found I tend to forget to use it because it isn&#x27;t in my bathroom (where I typical wash my face before bed).  The second issue, for me, is I don&#x27;t care for the scent (definitely doesn&#x27;t remind me of roses); however, since the product is doing what it claims it will do I&#x27;m going to keep using it (when I remember).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother. She loves it. She swears it helps smoothe her skin. The product came quickly and the packaging is great!</li>
    <li> I had the chance to try out Rose hip oil by Yumi beautiful and loved the results that it gave to my face. I have had dry skin on my face and I used the Rose hip oil in hopes that it would help with the dryness. The oil isn&#x27;t too thin or thick, I honestly thought that it was the right consistancy and the smell was very pleasant to me and not very strong. When I applied it my face I started to notice within a few days that my skin was looking a lot better and not as dry, within about 2 weeks I had a considerable difference in the dryness of my skin.</li>
    <li> I think it is an excellent product. My skin feels and looks brighter.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, will order again and again.</li>
    <li> Love the way the oil leaves my face looking smooth and feeling soft. Very satisfied with my product</li>
    <li> not heavy.  small amount goes a long way leaving skin smooth with rosy glow.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this is organic! It&#x27;s hard trying to find facial products that doesn&#x27;t have all sorts of other chemicals to their products since your face is quite important to keep up with.  I was using this product on my face because I have been battling a major acne breakout since I gave birth to my son.  So far it has been helping with keeping the breakouts to a minimum.</li>
    <li> Great buy!  Recommend!</li>
    <li> I have several yumi products that I love, and this rosehip oil did not disappoint! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Odd color and smell, but the health benefits outweigh that!&lt;br /&gt;Fast service, arrived in good condition.</li>
    <li> Very impressed so far- I have been leaving it in the fridge as told by other reviewers- no horrible smell! and I have noticed my face is seemingly clearer and healthier looking. I started during the dry cold of winter season but will probably keep it up even as it becomes humid. I use it at night and it feel so nice in the morning</li>
    <li> Absorbs nicely makes my skin GLOW!!!</li>
