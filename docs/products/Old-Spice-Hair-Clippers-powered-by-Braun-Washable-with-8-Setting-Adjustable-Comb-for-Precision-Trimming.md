      <li>To me, lawn mower isn&#x27;t a great description; I would&#x27;ve expected more power and more noise...</li>
      <li>and I need to say that The Braun Old Spice Hair Clipper not only looks great, but works great as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to charge, and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Before purchasing this I bought  the Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Hair Clipper &amp; Beard Wet/Dry Trimmer which is also available here on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>(I got this for free from #bzzagent)</li>
      <li>no use paying the barber to do what I can do for free.</li>
      <li>After getting this free from BzzAgent</li>
      <li>Such a great pair of clippers.</li>
      <li>I received the product for free, to try and review, from Braun</li>
      <li>Using it has been effortless and it gets the job done; it smoothly cuts hair without any tug and pull or irritation.</li>
      <li>My favorite feature is the adjustable blade guard built right onto the front of it.  </li>
      <li>A very powerful clipper.</li>
      <li>Also being able to run them directly under water after to clean makes it very easy to keep them clean.</li>
      <li>This handy little guy works every bit as well as my A/C powered clippers, but is more handy.</li>
      <li>, it makes it super easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It has a pretty stylish design as well.</li>
      <li>Clean up after using them is a snap.</li>
      <li>I also like how quickly it charges.</li>
      <li>I got these clippers because of the shortcomings the hair trimmer on my shaver had, and was pleased by how much more I actually got with them.</li>
      <li>I prefer this one as its quick and gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend it, amazing value.</li>
      <li>is pretty sweet.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s certainly my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>This product can be used to cut any type of hair, and is well worth buying.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>This is definitely a fantastic product, the clipper really does allow you to trim your beard evenly and to your exact liking.  </li>
      <li>It is brand new, seems fine, works well</li>
      <li>It can take awhile to make sure the edges of your hair are clean and even and cut off completely (no stray hair).</li>
      <li>I just cut my hair with them and they did the job just as quickly and efficiently as the Wahl and they&#x27;re much lighter, compact, and not having to have them plugged in</li>
      <li>Knowing what I know now (even though this one looks way cooler than the Panasonic) I would not pay much more than the Panasonic costs for this unit; which, as of this review, is now about the same price.  </li>
      <li>So, be aware when they stop</li>
      <li>; I do use both though, with the Panasonic doing most of the detail work and this one doing larger chunks of hair.  </li>
      <li>and I actually like it better</li>
      <li>I received Old Spice Hair Clippers powered by Braun free for testing them out for BzzAgent.</li>
      <li>Quiet, light and powerful.  </li>
      <li>Second time purchase same product as a gift for my friend very high performance with good price</li>
      <li>Old Spice by Braun was reasonably priced, able to operate plugged in or cordless, and had the range of length adjustment that I was looking for, even better than my previous clippers.</li>
      <li>For being cordless, it has a large amount of power.</li>
      <li>The adjustable guard is a little bit pliable, but works nicely.  </li>
      <li>These clippers work very well.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>light wait.&lt;br /&gt;Simplicity in one header for various lengths.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>It comes with an adjustable head so that you can determine how much hair to cut off, and of course includes a charger and cleaning kit along with a manual.</li>
      <li>(Having to post from my wife&#x27;s amazon as she does all the purchasing so hers is ready to post where mine won&#x27;t allow it till I make a purchase.)</li>
      <li>It controls really well.</li>
      <li>This one gives me the option of a &amp;#34;forgot to shave today&amp;#34; look and, if I want to go back to a full beard, I have that option, too.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>Luckily, I had not thrown away the stand for my previous trimmer and this clipper &amp;#34;kind of&amp;#34; fits well enough that the stand is usable, even if the fit isn&#x27;t perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I had an old studio clipper I threw away because this clipper completely replaces the whole set.</li>
      <li>what would really bumb me out was that the battery would die right away, but with old spice trimer i noticed the battery lasted me for a while with a one single charge!</li>
      <li>The length adjustment shield comes off completely, and I use the bare blade to trim edges or to get rid of hair growth that would clog my razor immediately if I went straight to shaving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I recieved the Old Spice Hair Clipper for free to review and there are absolutely no complaints about this product!!</li>
      <li>The clipper took care of the job seamlessly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not as loud as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts</li>
      <li>/&gt;Requires frequently hair removal</li>
      <li>I knew I had to try this when Old Spice described it as a lawn mower for your hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this thing.  I wear my hair extremely short now--no use paying the barber to do what I can do for free.</li>
    <li> Second time purchase same product as a gift for my friend very high performance with good price</li>
    <li> These clippers work very well.  Quiet, light and powerful.  The adjustable guard is a little bit pliable, but works nicely.  Clean up after using them is a snap.</li>
    <li> A bit bigger than I was expecting, the charger makes a weird humming noise when it&#x27;s charging. The plastic guard seems flimsy but it works and doesn&#x27;t pop off while using.</li>
    <li> I would have liked it better if it had been a lower price point; when I bought it I paid $44.00. Before purchasing this I bought  the Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Hair Clipper &amp; Beard Wet/Dry Trimmer which is also available here on Amazon.  It was $20.00 cheaper and I actually like it better; I do use both though, with the Panasonic doing most of the detail work and this one doing larger chunks of hair.  Knowing what I know now (even though this one looks way cooler than the Panasonic) I would not pay much more than the Panasonic costs for this unit; which, as of this review, is now about the same price.  I will say this; keep it charged and you&#x27;ll not want to go back to a corded trimmer/clipper ever again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for head and beard trim!! Must have!!</li>
    <li> does not cut my hair down close as i would like</li>
    <li> Good quality clippers. I did have to go over the thick hairs a handful of times but it cuts better than other clippers I have tried in this price range.</li>
    <li> It is brand new, seems fine, works well but the plastic parts on the guide have me concerned about how well the adjustable guide will last.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was excellent, on time, well packaged.</li>
    <li> It simply is great. It controls really well. The charger is great and takes so quickly to charge. My only bad thing to say is I wish it came with a travel bag.</li>
    <li> A must have for all - ideal for those who want to keep a nice trim in between cuts or those who want to keep their hair nice and cut. The adjustable blades really make it easy to get around the ear and trim up your look and the clipper works flawlessly. I would definitely recommend it, amazing value. I recieved the Old Spice Hair Clipper for free to review and there are absolutely no complaints about this product!!</li>
    <li> I love the Braun product line. As well as Old Spice so combine the 2 and you have an epic product. I like that it comes inred &amp; has different setting for just what I need. I also like the fact it&#x27;s wireless. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have an electric Braun shaver with cleaning and charging base. I got these clippers because of the shortcomings the hair trimmer on my shaver had, and was pleased by how much more I actually got with them. I can cut my hair. I can cut my sons hair. The guard is adjustable and it stays where it&#x27;s set. Cleans easily. Has enough power to tackle even the thickest of hair. Plus, it&#x27;s red and looks awesome.</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers! love that it can be used cordless #bzzagent i got to try this out because of them and I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> light wait.&lt;br /&gt;Simplicity in one header for various lengths.&lt;br /&gt;Good Quality.</li>
    <li> great you should try it #bzzagent #oldspice cut hair the best and as always best of the best old spice</li>
    <li> I received Old Spice Hair Clippers powered by Braun free for testing them out for BzzAgent. I rate them a 4. They have a lot going for them, I will list my pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Can be used wired or wirelessly&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have to keep up with a million different pieces to decide length&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Super Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;They tend to clog a bit easy if you have them on a longer length setting&lt;br /&gt;They felt like they bogged down a bit with my hair because it&#x27;s thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these are a great pair of clippers for the price. They hold up better then most cheaper clippers and are a lot more convenient. I would recommend them to a friend. (Having to post from my wife&#x27;s amazon as she does all the purchasing so hers is ready to post where mine won&#x27;t allow it till I make a purchase.) ~~~~~~~~ Terp</li>
    <li> I knew I had to try this when Old Spice described it as a lawn mower for your hair. To me, lawn mower isn&#x27;t a great description; I would&#x27;ve expected more power and more noise... but it is enough power and very little noise. I have extremely thick hair that most clippers fail to trim on the first past. These clippers trimmed nearly everything right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not as loud as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts through thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Easy adjustments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Hair gets stuck in the adjuster too easily.&lt;br /&gt;Requires frequently hair removal while trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll deal with the hair getting stuck because this clipper is significantly better than everything else I&#x27;ve used... especially in the battery-powered category. I doubt that you&#x27;ll regret buying this clipper... it&#x27;s certainly my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> I ONLY USED ON TIME AND THEN IT DOES&#x27;T WORK ANY MORE. THIS IS REALLY BAD. DON&#x27;T BUY IT.</li>
    <li> So i have had a couple of trimers like Gillet and sony ones and they are good but what would really bumb me out was that the battery would die right away, but with old spice trimer i noticed the battery lasted me for a while with a one single charge! Im really satisfied  with the product overall it cuts hair good and smooth and it feels great in ur hand</li>
    <li> Great product. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. A bargain for the price.</li>
    <li> These clippers are an excellent fit in the hand, with the on/off switch conveniently located for the thumb to control on/off.  There are no separate parts to keep up with other than oil and a brush for the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery only lasted for a trim around the ears/neckline before the clippers went &amp;#34;dead.&amp;#34;  After plugging them in to the charger for a while, they came on.  So, be aware when they stop, it is only that the battery is dead.  This is the only negative thing about the clippers. Not a long battery charge.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wahl clippers for several years and don&#x27;t have any complaints on how they cut, but they&#x27;re pretty bulky, corded-only, and you have to change out the clipper heads for different lengths and there&#x27;s a ton of clipper heads. I was a little sketchy about these Braun Old Spice ones because they are so much smaller than my Wahl and when I powered it on after charging, it was much more quiet (almost sounds like a clipper that was running short on battery) and I thought maybe that meant less power. Not so though. I just cut my hair with them and they did the job just as quickly and efficiently as the Wahl and they&#x27;re much lighter, compact, and not having to have them plugged in is pretty sweet. Also being able to run them directly under water after to clean makes it very easy to keep them clean. Definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair clipper I have ever used. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to charge, and easy to clean. My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t use it if you want a close shave. It seems like it can cut pretty close, but it usually takes a couple of runs if you want to cut all of your hair off. It can take awhile to make sure the edges of your hair are clean and even and cut off completely (no stray hair). I received the product for free, to try and review, from Braun and I need to say that The Braun Old Spice Hair Clipper not only looks great, but works great as well. For being cordless, it has a large amount of power. Using it has been effortless and it gets the job done; it smoothly cuts hair without any tug and pull or irritation. This product can be used to cut any type of hair, and is well worth buying. It comes with an adjustable head so that you can determine how much hair to cut off, and of course includes a charger and cleaning kit along with a manual.</li>
    <li> Soon as I received it in the mail I was eager to put it to use. I was low on cash and in need of grooming. The clipper took care of the job seamlessly. It comes equipped with a detachable clip attachment to either bump up or down to get the precision cut you desire.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a fantastic product, the clipper really does allow you to trim your beard evenly and to your exact liking.  I love that you can change the trim settings on the clippers without having to add or remove attachments.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had problems in the past with other clippers with the switch being flipped on by accident from being moved around in a suit case, for example. With these clippers the power button is flat, this way I don&#x27;t have to worry about my clippers being switched on unknowingly and the battery being wasted.  It has a pretty stylish design as well.</li>
    <li> A great product that does exactly as advertised. A very powerful clipper. Cuts through think hair with ease. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this thing!  My favorite feature is the adjustable blade guard built right onto the front of it.  No more swapping blade guards to change lengths.  I also like how quickly it charges.</li>
    <li> It works better than a lawnmower. It is easy to use and save visits to a barbershop.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.  I could not buy replacement batteries for my cordless andis for this price.</li>
    <li> I have heavy beard that I didn&#x27;t think a battery powered device could deal with. I was wrong. This handy little guy works every bit as well as my A/C powered clippers, but is more handy.</li>
    <li> great hair clippers…easy to use, easy to set the clipper length and keeps a full charge for quite some time when unplugged - highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Does the job of trimming my 2 year old son&#x27;s hair without visiting the barber every few weeks, he does not complain about it as long as we show him videos of his favorite cartoons</li>
    <li> When I first received this clipper, I thought it would be some regular clipper, but it wasn&#x27;t due to its stylelock technology and the amount of power that it had for a cordless clipper amazed me. It is what it says: it is a lawn mower for your hair. (I got this for free from #bzzagent)</li>
    <li> Such a great pair of clippers. I used them on my beard and to do quick hair cut trims and they have worked out great. I wish they would give a closer shave like an electric razor but they do a great job nonetheless. Very powerful and the adjustable and removable sizing is really great too!</li>
    <li> Bought these because they had the highest review on Amazon for hair Clippers. I have been cutting my own hair for over 5 years now and these are by far the worst I&#x27;ve ever used. The guard which is preattached, is made of cheap plastic and spreads when  any small amount of force is used. If you apply any pressure when cutting your hair, the teeth on the guard spread open and the straight blade is exposed to your hair. I tried these once and the back of my hair was completely scalped. Jokes on me because I gave them a second chance after the hair had grown back and the exact same spot was completely scalped. I am honestly shocked that any good reviews of these exist. Even without the complete scalping the Clippers leave your head looking like a grass cut my a lawn mower and several different blade settings, completely patchy and uneven. Terrible terrible product.</li>
    <li> After getting this free from BzzAgent I have to say I would of paid money for this. I had an old studio clipper I threw away because this clipper completely replaces the whole set. No more annoying clip on length limiters, as this product has an adjustable length limiter which is great! WOULD RECOMMEND!&lt;br /&gt;fox_racing_1990</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 different hair clippers in my life time. I have to say this one bets all the one have owned to date. I love that it is water proof, it makes it super easy to clean. I love the look and feel of the design.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair with a wired Wahl clippers for years and got this as a gift recently.  I prefer this one as its quick and gets the job done.  not having to switch guards is another big bonus.</li>
    <li> The plastic piece to help cut the length of your hair fell off after only using it a few times. I can&#x27;t get it back on. So I can&#x27;t use it for the reason I bought it.</li>
    <li> I looked at many clippers / beard trimmers that were available. I wanted to buy the same make / model that I was already using, because it was sturdy and lasted quite a few years before dying off. Unfortunately, the model was no longer available and the makers&#x27; current offerings were not attractive options.&lt;br /&gt;This Old Spice by Braun was reasonably priced, able to operate plugged in or cordless, and had the range of length adjustment that I was looking for, even better than my previous clippers. Some clippers only adjust to trim your beard really short, and can adjust to only slightly longer. Some give you a limited choice of lengths because you have to use one shield or another. This one gives me the option of a &amp;#34;forgot to shave today&amp;#34; look and, if I want to go back to a full beard, I have that option, too. Length is measured in mm, and adjusts from 3mm to 24mm. It seems to be sturdily built, not flimsy at all. The length adjustment shield comes off completely, and I use the bare blade to trim edges or to get rid of hair growth that would clog my razor immediately if I went straight to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no case or stand of any sort that comes with it, so you have to keep it in a drawer or in the medicine cabinet if you don&#x27;t want it to lay on your vanity all the time. Luckily, I had not thrown away the stand for my previous trimmer and this clipper &amp;#34;kind of&amp;#34; fits well enough that the stand is usable, even if the fit isn&#x27;t perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I did my research and comparison shopping, made a choice, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have always cut my husbands hair and trimmed his beard.  This tool is really nice and easy to use.  I only use it to trim his beard, mustache and eyebrows.  Works perfect.</li>
