<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected, but I know my Grandaughter will love it.</li>
    <li> The trays on the top are very flimsy. One was broke when I received it and the other broke within the first time of use.</li>
    <li> Just got my makeup kit today and its beautiful most differently gonna be gettin it from Amazon</li>
    <li> I ordered both. There both great. Since i tan a lot, i do use the white kit more.</li>
    <li> I brought this gift for my sister it was even more nicer in person, comes neatly packages &amp; has a beautiful mirror :)</li>
    <li> Works great for dance competitions, the lip glosses are my favourite part!</li>
    <li> Absolutely dissatisfied  it was alike broken and had fingerprints in it  case was also btoken</li>
    <li> If I could give it less stars I would. Box had no sign of damage or abuse in any way but contents completely destroyed. Total garbage!  Never again!</li>
    <li> looks nice in picture but when i received the product it was melted and broken</li>
    <li> The product looks like the picture and the description is accurate. I just received my set so I haven&#x27;t had the pleasure of wearing any of it yet. Unfortunately, when the package arrived, my mirror was broken. I refuse to send it back since they do not do replacements, only refunds. Other than that, I&#x27;m looking forward to using the E.L.F. product! ~DC~</li>
    <li> Sadly, this make-up collection arrived all broken up inside and it was part of a birthday gift to my mom. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the makeup, but the case arrived scuffed and scratched,  this was a gift for someone and it was embarrassing to give it to her in a dirty scratched case. It&#x27;s always frustrating when new things arrive in that condition. The makeup was untouched, except for a big glob of lip gloss that got dripped on some of the inside plastic trays. I was able to wipe it off. I suggest checking this makeup before you give it to someone as a gift, don&#x27;t just hand them an unopened box.</li>
    <li> it was broken when it got to me. I ahve to return it.</li>
    <li> Cousin loved it, although the pic makes it look like its bigger</li>
    <li> Everything its Broken in It when It arived!</li>
    <li> With makeup, you normally get what you pay for. This Makeup collection was a pleasant surprise though!&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadows: Some of the more matte colors have good color payoff. However, some of the purples and pinks are more translucent than I would like, but the colors are beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Blushes: The blushes are very shimmery. That is personal preference whether you like shimmery or matte blushes&lt;br /&gt;Lipgloss: These are lip glosses with a bit of color. They are sticky, and mostly just add shine&lt;br /&gt;Bronzers and highlighter: The bronzers are actually really nice. They had three, one matte darker brown, shimmery medium brown, and one slightly more orange color.</li>
    <li> This was all broken. Not from delivery bc thay wasn&#x27;t possubk. The patio case was broken it won&#x27;t slide open and all the makeup is cracked!</li>
    <li> The quality of the product given to me was horrendous. It was intended as a small gift for my girlfriend on our three year anniversary, and it arrived with all of the make up strewn about the entire thing, a dirty holder and box, and unusable brushes. I know it wasn&#x27;t my delivery&#x27;s fault because I have never had a problem with my local driver. Please, for the sake of saving money, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> colors all mixed!! Very dirty.Can&#x27;t use!!!!!!!! Many colors already broken!!!</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas present and am super pleased. There are many eye shadow options to choose from, as well as blush, bronzer, and lip glosses. It even comes with a couple little brushes all neatly organized in it&#x27;s self contained case. Perfect for travel since just about everything you need is right there!</li>
    <li> I love the eye shadows. So many pretty colors and the blushes are great. I use the bottom two bronzers for contouring. The only complaint I have is that everything in this kit has glitter in it. I don&#x27;t mind glittery eyeshadows but it becomes a problem when my entire face is sparkling.</li>
    <li> A gift for my granddaughter, for her birthday!!!!  I felt that the plastic case was a little cheap but she seems to like the products.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the pigment was good</li>
    <li> Still discovering ways to use this. Been having fun just making my face up, I am a minimalist when it comes to makeup. Haven&#x27;t worn any in years. The colors are awesome and the lip glosses look good and feel good.</li>
    <li> Great kit wish there was more</li>
    <li> This is great. It has everything that I use in all the colors I love. It is kind of hard to open and the brushes are a great size. Was to pack and travel with since this would be all you need to complete your look.</li>
    <li> Beautiful  set great size and we&#x27;ll padded only thing I&#x27;m upset about is the the pin is broken to keep the top on</li>
    <li> This was a perfect gift for my teenage niece. She&#x27;s just starting to wear makeup and this kit has everything for her age.</li>
    <li> Bad. The box itself looked very old and was broken. The colors were not as bright and good as described in the product. The powder looked used. The box was broken. The colors not so good</li>
    <li> Face brushes shed pretty bad. Make up seems to be true in color. Overall good product. Wish lip gloss lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Makeup looks really sparkly especially the powder in the middle . I defiantly would not buy again. Color looks different than in the picture. I would definitely would not recommend .</li>
    <li> I received it broken. Do not buy this</li>
    <li> Great makeup collection at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Came on time.  It&#x27;s very nice quality for it&#x27;s price especially for someone wh</li>
    <li> When I received this product in the mail, 3 of the eye shadows were completely destroyed and not usable. It got on a majority of the other eyeshadows and around the container it came in.</li>
    <li> The colors are very strong, so I recommend experimenting when you get it- not on a day when you are heading out the door!  But that means you only need to use a small amount of product.  It is nice to be able to sample colors.  But I probably will not buy such a large kit again, and instead stick to colors that I prefer to wear.</li>
    <li> This set is very affordable and has lots of choices and great colors.  It&#x27;s great to be able to pick colors to match my clothes everyday.  Didn&#x27;t have many options before! This is a great buy!</li>
    <li> Bought for my cousin for Christmas. She loved it and I got a good deal on it! Very Good Buy!</li>
    <li> The kits was broken when I received it. The quality is really lower than I expect. It is not so good.</li>
    <li> So many great color combinations! I love the various eye shadow colors and the cheek colors are great.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the lip color; it&#x27;s hard to apply and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Also, be prepared to use your own brushes rather than what is supplied.  But it&#x27;s worth the cost just for the eye shadow.</li>
    <li> The item was pretty much as described, but the mirror was shattered when it arrived. I returned it.</li>
    <li> this make up kit is awsome like the othe reivewers say. IT has so many choices of color and its very well quaility make up its not the cheap stuff!!;) I love the bronzers they are great and the selection of eyeshadows , the lip glosses are okay but i have tone of them at home.So its a really good bang for the buck!</li>
    <li> A little disappointed - case is not made  well. Not constructed together.</li>
    <li> I ordered the e.l.f. Makeup kit ,it was exactly what I expected for my 12 year old daughter she will be very happy!!The pigments are great for the $. Might want to use a primer under the face make up that is a little light , Shipping was fast &amp;everything intact :)</li>
    <li> Exceptional value.  Arrived in perfect condition, makeup is of a very good qualityand just the perfect size.  Thought it was actually bigger but pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for a Xmas gift because she loves makeup and I&#x27;m not rely good at buying make up cause I&#x27;m a guy but I knew when I got this I won it has so much to pick from</li>
    <li> I like this set pretty good. I haven&#x27;t tried all the shadows yet but the ones I have tried are pretty pigmented.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife and it looks great very well set-up but the colors just don&#x27;t seem to match. my wife is black but more Spanish skin like and the color seem to seat on her skin like a make-up for carnival still look good but hard to get them to look natural</li>
    <li> This item arrived with right side slide broken and and inside piece was broken off and eye shadow cakes cracked and smudged.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I do special occassion makeup and this kit is so easily portable and packed with the basic essentials. Compact but not too small. Can&#x27;t beat the value with ELF, love their products. I recommend separate lip pallet for variety and brushes/tools for application then you&#x27;re set</li>
    <li> Box was broken when I recieved it</li>
    <li> The makeup goes on smooth and last for awhile, but it arrived with 4 of the squares busted to dust...Had to go dust it off in the garbage because it went everywhere...&lt;br /&gt;since it was only 4 busted I decided to keep it and not mail it back..Overall satisfied with the purchase...they just need a better mailing packaging..</li>
    <li> My soon to be grand daughter inlaw just loves it, it is like giving flowers to my wife, you just can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I got my make up shipped on time which was wonderful. However, one of the eye shadows were broken and the inside of the case is broken the eye shadows do not pull out of each side, I have to remove them in order to use it. It&#x27;s small not like in the picture but the make up is not bad.</li>
    <li> i would give it a zero star if i could the package was damaged and so waa tje actual product</li>
    <li> received in unacceptable condition. 90% of product was mashed and pulverized. Umbelivable! gave it back immediately.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my girlfriend and when it came the box and everything inside was broken. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> This make-up kit would have been wonderful had it not have been used, returned and resold without being checked.It had fingerprints in every eyeshadow and on lipstick . Bought this during the summer for a Christmas gift so did not see it until my daughter opened it on Christmas Eve and cannot return it due to the time lapse.Very disappointed.....</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with the quality, delivery and packaging of this product.  It was delivered in very good condition, ready to use and is an excellent brand when it comes to make-up.</li>
    <li> I probably would have loved it if it didn&#x27;t arrive damaged. Had to send this one back because it was unusable.</li>
    <li> opened the package... and the makeup spilled everywhere. it was completely broken! do not get.</li>
    <li> I bought this set from eyeslipsface.com (their official site) at 90% off ($3.50) and I have to say it is amazing! Not only because it was so cheap (with the purchase of $25 additional product---which I was much obliged), but because it works like professional makeup and all of E.L.F. makeup is vegan and cruelty-free (no animal testing)!</li>
    <li> I bought this  for my wife as a gift. she opened it birthday morning and found some make up was broke. guess that was where the mail came, the other colors that were not ruined really liked my wife</li>
    <li> The e.l.f. makeup collection was very compact.  Nice little case that opens up to many levels of different makeup.  Very disappointed with the shipping.  This was a Christmas present for my daughter and when she opened it the case was cracked.  We had to super glue the exterior.  After it glued shut we could then open it.  Overall.....the kit had good colors but shipping was horrible.</li>
    <li> I love this product so many colors to choose from but the eyeshadow kinda wears off easy, I could just be sitting around the house and have to reapply more every so often.</li>
    <li> Practically everything you need right at your finger tips. I travel a lot so this was exactly what I needed. The colors are ones I like. Nothing too garish, bright or glittery. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> One of the cosmetic trays were busted and when we opened this up there was make up everywhere. The end.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old niece was very thrilled to get this makeup set. She loves the variety of colors and that it&#x27;s compact enough to carry with her.</li>
    <li> I loved the kit upon seeing it and loved it even more after using it... so fun to play with the colors!</li>
    <li> its a small box with a lot of beautiful colors, but I didn&#x27;t really like it because when you try to put it on your face it comes out to light! do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> I bought myself this kit when I was black Friday shopping at Target for $15 and I LOVE it! I wish I had bought more, because I&#x27;m certainly not going to last all year on one. The kit comes with so many options and the colors are great. They last pretty well, unlike some brands that you have to keep reapplying every few minutes. I love everything about this makeup set! If you&#x27;re looking for a great gift for a girlie girl in your life, this is a good start! :-)</li>
    <li> My Daughters loves it</li>
    <li> Good product but got it broken up</li>
    <li> Hi today I got 83 Piece Essential Makeup Collection, and one of the powders wines all shattered I looked great and had great disappointment illusion</li>
    <li> Love it, but pieces of the set was broken when i received it. Very small. Cant slide out</li>
    <li> I am new to make up so this is a good starter kit.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister and she loved it !!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful set!  Actually ordered one for my Mom!  Perfect for travel!  Various range of colors!  I only wish it had a little bit more storage so I could put my mascara and eyeliner and be ready to go!</li>
    <li> nice makeup for the price.</li>
    <li> Received as a scrap, spill over the package and spoiled other items too..</li>
    <li> like the product. the only problem when i got it some of the makeup was broken and the trays would not slide out. they popped off and now cant get them back on. i&#x27;m happy with the makeup that i can use but not happy about the condition it arrived in.</li>
    <li> Makeup was shattered. If I could rate this a zero I would.</li>
    <li> It came a day late but that&#x27;s okay. The kit came in intact expect for one of the bronzers but I probably wouldn&#x27;t have used that one any way it would have been a bit to dark for my skin tone. But other then that, I love this kit!</li>
    <li> The product was broken when I opened the package. ..</li>
    <li> My daughter in law is in Malaysia and is finished with beauty school. This will be great for her work.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this, the eye shadows are very nice and long lasting wear. The blush is very pretty and long lasting as well. Bronzers are very nice as well. I think the lip gloss wears out fast but its pretty for short term.</li>
