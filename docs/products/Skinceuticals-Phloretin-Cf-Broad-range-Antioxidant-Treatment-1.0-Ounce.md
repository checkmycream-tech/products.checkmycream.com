      <li>This is a perfect example of &amp;#34;too good to be true.&amp;#34;  I paid $140 for this same sized bottle from my doctor and $115 for it from this seller.  </li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Both said many people cannot use this product.</li>
      <li>It also helps with texture and tone and most nights I just use the serum without any additional moisturizer.  </li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I swear by this product, which I&#x27;ve using for many years.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Item I received is not authentic. This is going back.</li>
    <li> I have used the Skinceuticals products for several years and I find them to be very effective.  I use this antioxidant treatment after cleansing my skin and before I use the Skinceuticals Skin Firming Cream, which I highly recommend, and the SPF50 sun screen.  I waited until I was in my 60s before using these products but I recommend that you begin as early as possible.  They may seem expensive but each bottle lasts six months or more and are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product that addresses several skin problems.  I had issues with minor breakouts before trying this product - I have not had any breakouts since I started using it.  It also helps with texture and tone and most nights I just use the serum without any additional moisturizer.  The only small complaint i would have is that it doesn&#x27;t help much with lightening dark spots (although at least mine haven&#x27;t gotten worse)</li>
    <li> Love the product. It is cheaper online than at the dermatologist. However the smaller bottles are usually a better deal and better to travel with and also oxidize less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely LOVE it!  I have a very sensitive skin, but this didn&#x27;t make my skin red or anything like that. I even use it around my eye area!  I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin. It feels and looks softer. I had very fine lines around my eyes and even those are like softer, maybe even gone.  I have an oily skin and this doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily at all. It keeps it almost matte the whole day.   I would definately purchase this item again, eventhough it SO much more expensive for me. I live in Curacao and 100 US Dollars are like 180 Guilders for me.   But this item really works!!! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this and raves about it.  She can see a difference in her skins clarity.  In fact she no longer wears base.  Her pores appear tighter also.  Not for wrinkles, but more for texture and sun damage i think.  4 star because the price is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This product, Phloretin CF, burned my skin and left welts for several days. The advice from the seller (a dermatologist) and the manufacturer, SkinCeuticals, was to discontinue use. Both said many people cannot use this product. So unless you want to waste the purchase price of this product insist on a test before you buy.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! My skin never looked better.</li>
    <li> Even my super sensitive skin tolerated this product well.  It made my skin feel tingley and alive.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of SkinCeuticals products and decided to purchase the Phloretin CF (over the CE Ferulic) to address age spots on my face. I hardly took care of my skin during my teenage years -- never wore moisturizer nor sunscreen -- and as a result, my skin became parched, with age spots surfacing little by little every year...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to note that after 2 weeks of using the product, my face looked and felt smoother and tighter, and my complexion lightened up as well. I layer sunscreen on top of this for added protection. What&#x27;s the point in using this if you don&#x27;t actively minimize sun damage concurrently, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell, though a bit undesirable, is tolerable for me, and the product takes some time to soak into the skin. It does leave a slightly greasy film on my face, but I matte it with sunscreen. It&#x27;s quite expensive for the bottle, and I used roughly 1/6 of the bottle in 2 weeks. If I continue to see results in the next couple of months, I will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and I got cheaper price than usual.&lt;br /&gt;So happy to use this item quickly and cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I was told by several people that I looked younger.</li>
    <li> It softened, made my pores smaller, evened out my skin color, made my skin more beautiful.  I&#x27;ve been using Skin Ceuticals for over 10 years, and nothing comes close to caring for my sink.</li>
    <li> The product I purchased was not Skinceuticals Phloretin.  I thought the product was legitimate because it was sealed.  When I opened the product to use it, the color and the smell did not smell like Phloretin.  The product was completely clear and had a totally different smell.  I will never purchase Skinceuticals products over the Internet again.  I wasted $116 dollars.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!!  I am very loyal to my SC products.  The new C makes my skin glow and i get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> After applying for few days, I started to develop small patches of rash over my face. I decided to keep trying for a few more days but it just spread all over!  It became really itchy and unsightly! I had this reaction with the Skinceuticals CE Feulic serum when I first started using that product but NOT to this extent. After I stopped using the CE Feulic serum and resumed usage after few months, I no longer had any problems.  In fact, I have been using CE Feulic serum for over a year now.  But with the Phloretin CF, stopping and then resuming use did not improve matters.  The rash just came right back after one day of use.  I have never had any problems with any products before this. I really wanted to give this product a try but even my arms and back of my hands developed rash when I applied it there!</li>
    <li> So far I am loving this product- still too early for me to rate it 5 stars, as I need to give it another couple of months for it to fully work, but so far, I see a difference and love to put it on in the morning. Also helps to put it on before applying sunscreen on your face to help the sunscreen work even better.     The seller shipped extremely promptly, and the package arrived in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, first recommended by my dermatologist.  Minimizes wrinkles and gives skin a softer look.  I use it before applying moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my Dermatologist.  Great UV protection, not sure if it really diminishes dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey!</li>
    <li> Love this product, wish I could dip my whole body in it!  Notice immediate results.  Definitely intend to purchase long term.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to get my melasma under control and it would slightly get better but become more sensitive so I would discontinue and it would come back worse. I have used retin a and hydroquinone for ever with minimal results. Still using the hydroquinone with this product and their CE product too. Results have been miraculous! I tried to target this with one or two products but really needed to attack this problem with several products and so glad I have. Will definitely stick with this product.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT.  IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN YOUR SKIN TONE.  BUT I MADE A MISTAKE AND USED IT UNDER MY EYES AND ON EYELIDS (DIDN&#x27;T PAY ATTENTION TO THE LABEL) AND HAD A BIG ALLERGIC REACTION ......REDNESS, ITCHING, EXTREME PUFFINESS.  I HAD TO USE A PRESCRIPTION STEROID OINTMENT TO GET MY EYE AREA BACK TO NORMAL.  BUT IF YOU USE AS DIRECTED, AND WASH YOUR HANDS BEFORE HANDLING EYE AREA, IT WILL REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR SKIN TONE.  (I&#x27;M WONDERING IF IT GETS MORE POTENT AS IT GETS OLDER........WONDER WHAT SKINCEUTICALS WOULD SAY ABOUT THAT.)</li>
    <li> I originally won this product at a raffle in a Spa - price was over $150.00 - used it once a day and it made  my face feel wonderful.  My skin texture was amazingly soft and just looked and felt 5 years younger.  Highly recommend to try it.</li>
    <li> I received this product today.  The box had been opened AND the plastic tamper resistant wrap around the lid/dropper had clearly been torn enough to allow the bottle to be opened.  I put a few drops in my hand as I do every morning to see if it had been watered down.  Both the color and consistency is different leading me to believe it has definitely been altered.  This is a perfect example of &amp;#34;too good to be true.&amp;#34;  I paid $140 for this same sized bottle from my doctor and $115 for it from this seller.  I will contact them today but BUYER BEWARE!  This is not a reputable, trustworthy or honest seller.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and I have used it for several years.  I am happy to be able to get it at a discount on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and ordered it from Amazon on several occasions and always got it fast and the product was wonderful and&lt;br /&gt;what a great price.</li>
    <li> This magic elixir will take years off your face.  No joke everytime I use it, I save it up, I get compliments.  Husband is a chef and not a particularly vain man, but sometimes he does local tv spots and he sneaks it before he has to go on tv.  Funny.... but he notices it works on me and when he wants to look his best he knows what works.</li>
    <li> Biggest fan!!! Love all their products. This is just another great  vitamin booster C for ur aging everyday skin. Can&#x27;t miss a day w out it. Wish I would of know about it  sooner, but it&#x27;s ok now that I know about this skin line n product already. Great buy n product love it  definitely would recommend it to friends and families.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product ever for making your skin look and feel healthy and glowing, it&#x27;s liquid gold!</li>
    <li> This product really helps to prevent fine lines and take good care of your skin - just use a small amount everyday and follow with moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My only problem with Skinceuticals Phloretin Cf is that I can&#x27;t stop looking at my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 days, in conjunction with the B gel (I don&#x27;t know the full name) and a clarisonic brush once a day, and my pores are smaller, my skin more even and glowing-- even though I&#x27;m not at the \\&quot;bare face\\&quot; stage yet, my makeup goes on SUPER smoothly. It&#x27;s genuinely amazing. You won&#x27;t regret this buy.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my doctor and its great for dry skin and prevention.Its expensive but worth. The glss botle is kind of fragile, must take extra care not to drop It</li>
    <li> I have used this product and its previous versions daily for 16 years beginning when I was 48. Now many people believe I am still in my 40s. Whenever anyone asks me my secret, I always tell them to use Skinceuticals Phloretin Cf Boad-range Antioxidant Treatment. It&#x27;s true that my parents are young looking and I also use a good sun screen product and limit my sun exposure, but I attribute the suppleness and smoothness of my skin to my Skinceuticals treatment. Before I started using this product, I had two basal cell cancers removed from my face. Since I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals I have had no new cancers. Try it...even though it&#x27;s expensive, the small amount needed daily (4 to 8 drops for me) make it affordable. In fact, you cannot afford not to use it.</li>
    <li> good stuff for clearing up the skin and reducing the effects of aging - use once a day just 2-3 drops!! this was recommended by my esthetician and I like it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it regularly!!  Also, the delivery time was exceptional!</li>
    <li> This product may have very good qualities but it gave me a rash (I tried using it twice with a significant break in between to be certain it was in fact the Phloretin Cf that was the problem).  The rash was much worse the second time.  For many people this may be a very good product but I would strongly suggest obtaining a sample size somewhere to test before spending this much money on a product you may not be able to use.  I gave mine away...</li>
    <li> Have used this product before, and I like it.  Makes my skin look more radiant.  Tones the skin slightly.</li>
    <li> This is a good product I would recommend to anyone. However, BEWARE OF COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS. I ordered Phloretin from PLATINUM STYLE to get a better price. The product I received was not in the manufacturers box. When I opened it, it was a white colorless liquid that didn&#x27;t look at all like the Phloretin I purchased previously, and smelled only vaguely the same. So, there are a lot of counterfeits out there. Hopefully, someone at Amazon will read this review and contact Platinum Style about selling bogus products. There are other reviews I read on Amazon from people complaining about receiving fake Phloretin. Since, I&#x27;ve never had this happen before with products I bought through Amazon, I assumed it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me - but, it did!</li>
    <li> took this product to a certified dealer and compared the smell and texture and the packaging etc. and it is the real deal. all good</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Very lightweight and absorbs quickly. I love the night concentration of vitamin c and anti-oxidents.</li>
    <li> My skin became luminous, and looks like more younger in only one week. And the treatment is beggining.  It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m using attending a dermatologic recomendation.</li>
    <li> amazing product. worth the money</li>
    <li> Wonderful decision and I recommend for all. Continue selling and people will continue to purchase this great product. Glad I purchased and ill share with friends</li>
    <li> I thought the product was very good, but not worth the price.  I like Avon Anew Platinum just as much and it is considerably less than 1/2 the price.  My skin also felt a little sticky after I put this serum on.  You also need to be careful and not drop any on a marble service as it stains.  I would buy again if it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Two stars for not causing any damage but not doing anything useful, either.  I saw no difference in my sun and age-related spots, and no increased glow or anything.  Whatever it did at a cellular level didn&#x27;t show up anywhere I could see it.  This was my opinion of a few products I tried over the last year or so.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product from a dermatologist, and love it.  The only suggestion that I would make, is that you &#x27;roll&#x27; the applicator across your skin, instead of putting drops on your fingers to apply.  )Lasts longer).</li>
    <li> This has been recommended by 2 dermotologists and 1 esthetician. I&#x27;ve used it for years, it and the other Vit C products are superior.</li>
    <li> There is a slight--very slight--stickiness when applied.  Allow it to dry, then apply your moisturizer and the stickiness goes away, BUT the healthy glow it leaves is there under your make-up.  AND, it works its skin healing magic all day long.</li>
    <li> This product has saved my skin from hormonal chin acne!! Love it</li>
    <li> This is the best serum of vit C out there, as much as I hate Loreal but Skin Ceuticals make great products for the most part and unfortunately was bought by Loreal some years ago so they increased the prices.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless,I have been using this for over 10 years and there is not a day that I dont hear people commenting on my skin and I am 50 years old. I love it and totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is expensive and worth it. I am a red head with freckles...and it has helped retain moisture in my skin and reduce the darker pigment spots.  Helps me look about 10 years younger than my sisters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product directly from the dermatologist before and I will have to say... The one I purchased online (even though it was sealed) was lighter in color and seemed a little less effective than what I have previously purchased.</li>
    <li> This is a product that my doctor started me on, stating that it rebuilds collagen. It took about a week to really notice the difference in my skin and I will never be without it. GREAT product!</li>
    <li> I have tried all different skin are lines and skinceuticals is the only one I could tell a major difference!  This is a really good thing to use to protect your face from the elements!</li>
    <li> This is a gamble.  Sometimes you get decent product, but my last batch was very dark (it should be the color of straw) and was returned.  It is authentic SkinCeutical product, but maybe it hasn&#x27;t been stored correctly?  I&#x27;m no longer buying from this seller.  Have returned my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years. It&#x27;s been fine, although I haven&#x27;t noticed any notable changes. I recently did a bit of research, which has given me reason to pause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. 10% vitamin C is the minimum amount required to be effective topically. This product contains 10%. BUT it&#x27;s delivered in liquid. Even on the Skinceuticals website, it states that the product may turn orange when exposed to air, but this doesn&#x27;t affect the potency of the product. This is flat out untrue. Vitamin C turns orange when it&#x27;s oxidized (i.e. rendered ineffective) - and it oxidizes rapidly (within about a week, unless refrigerated, in which case it may last a month) when exposed to water/oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Phloretin may be the antioxidant du jour, but not in this product. Although there are compelling reasons to consider phloretin as another potent, beneficial antioxidant to improve skin&#x27;s appearance and healthy functioning, in the case of this product it is completely wasted. Why? Because the amount of denatured alcohol (&amp;#34;SD alcohol) in this serum negates any antioxidant benefit of the phloretin. The inclusion of alcohol is extremely disappointing because alcohol causes free-radical damage, cell death, and irritation. (I got this last part from another site that came up in my research)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it&#x27;s incredibly expensive. Knockoffs are, as far as I can tell, identical. But they&#x27;re also identical in their flaws and short comings.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from the Amazon Marketplace.  The serum was clearly diluted as it did not have the same color and consistency as I have encountered in the past.  The box had also been opened from the bottom as the tape had lost its stickiness and the protective seal on the top of bottle was tampered with so it could be opened without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a big fan and loyal customer of Amazon, I am extremely disappointed and shocked that Amazon could allow this to be sold on their site.  Especially considering people put this stuff on their face.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning. It helps restore the pigment discoloration on my face that became a problem when I was pregnant with my first child, and it also helps my ache. It leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed every morning.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Works great on fading age spots on my hands!  This is the first time I have been using it on my face and neck so I&#x27;m not sure how it will work on that, time will tell, but I&#x27;m assuming Skinceuticals Antioxidant Treatment will work great there too.</li>
    <li> Ive struggled with breaking out and this has really helped clear it up. I use it with the Phyto + and every other day the B5 (I just get scared it will moisturize too much). I&#x27;m just waiting for the marks to fade and I&#x27;ll have the skin I always dreamed of. I am using it more often then suggested tho but plan to slow down soon now that Im clear, and Ive been taking probiotics for a few months to help with any yeast situation in my body (I love sweets but getting better) but my skin hasn&#x27;t really cleared til this product. Oh and it also has just made the quality so nice. Just last week I ordered their clay mask which has really helped clear up the little black heads and stuff but the pimples (deep and cystic sometimes too) had already stopped. I love it. Came fast and in perfect condition, price is excellent. And I&#x27;m 35 and am eastern european I guess? I can tan very well but also get pale in winter, Im fair to medium complexion, combination skin I guess, not olive. If that helps. Also some people say it smells like hot dog, I really don&#x27;t smell it like that neither does my boyfriend. It does have a smell that isn&#x27;t divine but its not bad per se, more just musty a bit.</li>
    <li> This product has been an answer to my skin issues. Dark spots have disappeared. My skin is smoother. The fragrance is a natural scent that does not clash with my perfume the way so many products do. It has a subtle moisturizing effect that keeps my skin from drying out but does not make it break out.  Rather it has improved my skin tone all around. My dermatologist recommended this to help protect my skin against sun damage as it has antioxidants in it. It is expensive but has been worth every single penny! I have been using it for a year now and find fine lines have disappeared as an additional benefit.</li>
    <li> After using it for 2 times, my skin started getting dry and started peeling. And I don&#x27;t like the smell, my daughter stopped kissing me because of the smell. But their eye cream is pretty good.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! You can really see the difference in the tightness of your skin if you use it consistently. I love SkinCeuticals!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Extremely effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for years and I can never have this serum runs out on me.  Quick absorption and I don&#x27;t see any further discoloration or sun tan after I started using this serum.  I combine it with a good sunblock and I don&#x27;t have to worry about staying under the sun.</li>
    <li> Having grown up in Cal on the beach year round, baking as a teenager (why use sunscreen when your objective is the color of tanned leather?) I ended up with severe sun spotting on my face neck &amp; chest in my forties that only darkened every year despite my SPF 60. I spared no cost trying products to get rid of the spots.  After just a few weeks of this my skin tone improved and sun damage truly faded.  I have used this over TNS Recover complex for a year. Cover with any mositerizer at all. Costly, but cheaper than IPL.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of the same formula, but skinceuticals really has the best feel &amp; effect. I know there is no research supporting the use of Phloretin....I was leery....but it works for me. (FYI I am northern European caucasian) [[ASIN:B0019SQCPY Skin Ceuticals C E Ferulic Combination Antioxidant Treatment - 30ml/1oz]]</li>
    <li> As good as I had hoped. And product came fast. Will order again once I run out!</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic!!! I started to notice a difference within a week of using the serum. my brown spots are starting to fade away. LOVE IT!!! can&#x27;t wait to see how my face will look after using this for several wks/months/etc</li>
    <li> amazing and without hydroquinone which is awesome.. Often when you don&#x27;t use the high end product that works but has questionable ingredients, its hard to find something that actually works.  I had used Obagi Nuderm clear with the highly controversial ingredient hydroquinone, and had results.  Rarely can you find a product that is safe and works to that degree in the dark spot arena of problem areas.  This is phenomenal. I am 45 and everyone thinks I am in my 30s. I have a few dark spots on my cheek below the eye and this has done, dare I say a better job than the Obagi. I highly recommend it, and I consider myself a product critic of sorts.</li>
    <li> I used several products from Skinceuticals and this one is  truely amazing. I did not get any adverse reactions like I had   with AGE and my skin become smooth and bright after first use.   I already see some tightening effects after applying it for the second  time. Best product I came across and I have tried many other brands  like La Mer, Prevage, Channel, Strivectine, etc</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product, when I had a facial at a spa on Mother&#x27;s day.  Even though this is a very expensive product, it will last a long time.  You only use a few drops daily.  Your skin looks brighter, firmer and more younger looking with daily use. It&#x27;s a nice combination with less expensive face creams.</li>
    <li> I think this product is fake. I&#x27;ve used it before from another seller and the texture was complettly different from this one.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t notice much improvement after 4 months of use. I have read great reviews about this products hopefully I see them soon</li>
    <li> Love this...skin feel great and looks better...added benefit is it also offers some natural sun protection.  I still use sun screen, but apply this in the AM instead of PM for added protection.</li>
    <li> Great item! Quick shipping. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product actually works, not like over the counter stuff that is mainly falsely advertised all the time. If you use it consistently you will notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I use this every night (cant do AM because of a prescription acne cream I use), even layering it under my retinol on the 2 nights a week I use it.  As compared to the CE Ferulic it is less oily/hydrating so it is better for someone like me with normal to oily skin that is prone to breakouts (those with dry skin should go with the CE Ferulic).  I worked as an esthetician for years and was buying my product for wholesale through my employer in pro sizes but after I stopped working to go back to school I have found amazon generally has the best price offer for these products (average of 25% off retail).  Over the years of using this product purchased straight from the company on clients and myself I have found that this has a thin but not quite watery consistency (unlike the more syrupy CE Ferulic), and can be colored anywhere from clear to brown (the brown being the product that is oxidized from opening/closing the bottle, it is still effective for use just shows its exposure to oxygen and light).  When opened new it should be clear to yellow in color, brown means it is old or has been opened.  This product works really well in combination with retinol products for anti aging effects.  My skin is tighter and smoother with this added as compared to retinol alone and it does not cause me to break out.  It is one of the few products I invest my skincare dollars in, I use cheaper pharmacy products for face washes, toners and plain moisturizers and spend the most money on treatments, serums and eye creams.  Hopefully this info is helpful to someone!</li>
    <li> My derm recommended it. After using the product for 2 weeks, the result was obvious. My skin becomes softer, firmer and smoother. It does lighten up age spots, acne scars but doesn&#x27;t filled up large pores. But I&#x27;ve been using Retin-A as well so maybe the combination works well together.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I always get compliments that my skin looks healthy when I use this !! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I love it.  leaves your skin  feeling nice and smooth. I use it at night and  every morning.</li>
    <li> I´ve been using phoretin Cf for 2 weeks, and I can fell my skin more smoother and glossy. My skin is less oily too. I like very much this product. Let´s see if with time, the results improve.</li>
    <li> Do not purchase!! This is not the same product that you get from a medical office/esthetician. The box and bottle are the same but the product is watered down and oily.  Totally a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Changes your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it makes your face so soft.</li>
    <li> In my opinion (and I&#x27;m a medical esthetician), this is one of the best cosmeceutical company&#x27;s out there and this product is one of their top of the liners.  SO many top notch ingredients and research to back it up.  Great for anyone and any skin type.  I religiously use this along with the b5 gel every day and I constantly get compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and already see a difference.  Delivered quickly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for over a month now.  I can&#x27;t really say if it is doing anything or not. I bought it and it&#x27;s not cheap so I will continue to use it until its gone.  I guess then I may notice so I will update if I notice my skin going crazy when I am not using it anymore.  Disclaimer: I started using prescription Retin-A about halfway through the month so I am not sure what I can attribute to which product but like I said, I will continue to use this until it is gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I put it on before my sunscreen every day. Vit C prevents the sunscreen from oxidizing and losing its protective function.</li>
    <li> I am a longtime user of these products and have seen great results, however, if you want to be sure you are getting a pure product, you need to check out the list of AUTHORIZED retailers on their website. I sent an e-mail to Skinceuticals and they  verified every seller on their unauthorized list is indeed, NOT AUTHORIZED.

    <li> fabulous for fighting aging skin!  I love this product, not drying.  On the pricey side, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> All authentic Skinceuticals products come with a number printed on the bottom of the bottle that matches the one on the bottom of the box. No number and box was torn at the seal when I opened the package. I have ordered this serum many times from reputable, authorized Skinceuticals dealers and this bottle was clearly diluted. Buyer beware of this vendor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and this was the first time I purchased it from Amazon.  It was first recommended to me by my esthetician and then a couple years later when I went in for my first full body exam at the dermatologist, he was happy to hear that I was already using this product.  It&#x27;s great for people who are in the sun a lot, as I am as a track coach.  I&#x27;ve tried the less expensive versions of Phloretin CF that are out there, but I don&#x27;t think they work as well so I&#x27;ve gone back to Skinceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviewer was talking about when she said that this wasn&#x27;t the authentic product.  The box I received was sealed and had the number stamped on it and the bottle inside also had the number printed on it (on the side, not on the bottom). The bottle was also sealed and when I used it it felt just like my previous bottle of Phloretin CF. It was sold by HBC Depot and shipped directly from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price! You have saved me close to $50 compared to buying it locally.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I simply loved it! It made my oily skin so moisturized and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;It is simple and fast!&lt;br /&gt;It smells Vitamin C - as it should be - and it is not so good!&lt;br /&gt;The seller delivered it on time!&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend it!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time.  It was not damaged.  I would purchase from this sellar again.  It is a lil pricey.</li>
    <li> There is a noticeable improvement  in the texture and tone of my skin. People ask what I have done to have such clear glowing skin.  Product is a good value.</li>
    <li> This product was a indication of my dermatologist, it will be my 1st time using this product, I saw some interview and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product, especially for aging skin. It combats aging, adds firmness and life to the skin. Right now, I cannot find anything better than it and it also allows the use of other products.</li>
    <li> My friend has used this religiously for years and honestly she is not aging.  Maybe it is her healthy dining, exercise pattern and yoga but I have used this product for the past two years and even though I am not as gorgeous as my friend, I am less wrinkled and my skin looks fresher and brighter than my siblings and friends.  It won&#x27;t turn this old sun damaged skin of mine into some sort of baby clear beauty but I do think it helps my skin.</li>
    <li> It has noticeably improved complexion and softened skin. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s worth the money and I did use it completely.  Maybe if I used it longer?  I need faster results for that kind of money so I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Note: this is a product review...I bought this from my dermatologist, not on line. I am a 55 year old going through hormone changes and my skin has suddenly in the last 6 months looked like I was back to my icky breakout teenage years complete with oily skin making my makeup basically fall off my face by mid-day!! I have never had my face look so bad. I use Retin A at night (have for over ten years) however, I couldn&#x27;t seem to find anything that worked for me for anti-aging in the daytime, especially with my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; skin issues. I have used this product for three weeks now, alternating at night with the Retin A and this, and I use it 100% of the time during the day. What a difference!!! My blackheads and breakouts are 90-95% improved, my oiliness has calmed way down (although this goes on a little greasy feeling, but sinks in very well) and my overall skin texture is much better. Very happy!!! I use the dropper on my finger to apply it, but like the other reviewer!s idea of rolling the side of the eye dropper over your face. I&#x27;ll try that, especially to expand the use to my neck and perhaps my chest as well.</li>
    <li> This is a part of my skin ceuticals regiment I have enjoyed using this product to retain clearer skin .I am on my second bottle I use it once daily in the morning</li>
    <li> I swear by this product, which I&#x27;ve using for many years.  No alergies... no problem, just great skin.  I&#x27;ve used others, but they are not as good.  Highly recommend it, especially for normal to oily sking.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist, and I was able to buy it at more than a third off other places.</li>
    <li> great item, I purchased the smaller sizer and after one usage my pores are tad smaller and pigments on my cheeks are lighter , just a tad but thats with one use! I will buy bigger bottle. I am impressed, worked better than prescription Hydroquinone!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years now and love it especially during the winter months.  It does keep your skin looking bright and keeps dark spots at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily in the winter months as that is when I am not working on getting a tan.  My face naturally gets lighter, like most people during the winter months, and I feel like lighter skin shows more flaws.  Also, when wearing this product while you are tanning works as a very strong SPF and it seems to take longer for my face to tan.  I believe my esthetician said that it is because of the Phloretin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you ask what do you wear in the summer months.  Well...to keep putting on something that gives me high antioxidants to my skin I use Earth&#x27;s Glow natural vitamin C serum.  It is lovely and it gives the max amount of \\&quot;C\\&quot; your skin needs on a daily basis.  You can also buy this on Amazon. Try it I&#x27;ll bet you will love it too.</li>
    <li> If I had to give up all my skin care products and keep only one, this would be the one I&#x27;d keep.</li>
    <li> Super product, quick delivery</li>
    <li> The Phloretin CF I purchased from Amazon is not the same color or consistency as the Cf I purchased from my dermatologist.  I purchased online for  a $50 savings ($109.00 on Amazon).  What I received appears to be thinned out.  It is much more clear and thin then the original.  Also, what I received from Amazon is a little bit more oily on my face.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on a fake.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have used this for years.  My skin feels so much smoother after using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and saved money over buying it through my Spa.</li>
    <li> Been using for about 10 years.  It is the reason my skin looks so great.  Boosts your sunscreen effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this and didn&#x27;t see the difference between the Skinceutical CE ferulic.</li>
    <li> smells like chemicals&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t believe this got beauty award in magazine!!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t see any results yet, may be harming skin&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t believe PG in ingredients... its toxic!!</li>
    <li> Can rarely afford this but when I do I use it and swear by how it works! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware!  You may be buying product that has reached expiration and sold by a diverter!  I saw the representatives from Skinceuticals who warned that you should only buy the product from an authorized dealer.  New product will be clear when the bottle is first opened.  The bottle I purchased through Amazon was yellow in color, indicating it was old.  It smelled funny and didn&#x27;t feel right.  I had to throw the bottle out - a waste of $104.00.  Now I will only buy the product from my skin care professional.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone.  It is wonderful!  It feels great on your face and softens your&lt;br /&gt;look.  Use sparingly and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I´ve been using it for 2 years already and I can say it is  a great product!</li>
    <li> This is excellent&lt;br /&gt;I used this since two week ago! Amazing amazing amazin! I love this when I used in the morning I put this first then mosturizer and sun protector and after that facial  tint my skin is glowing ! Is amazing I want to try the other products from skinceutical becaused this one for me is the best skin product  that I buy it in a long time ! And I buy a lot !</li>
    <li> My wife was looking for this stuff and I found it at a discount (still steep for a small bottle) here.  Excellent service and a good price.  Box came a little crushed, but otherwise fine... threw the box out anyway.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I read in other reviews to check to make sure the bottom of bottle and box have same serial code.  It did, which makes me feel comfortable that it is an authentic product at a great price. I have used this product before and with a good skin regimen it can really improve the tone of your skin.  Use the vitamon b on top to avoid dry skin and then follow with a good moisturizer and of course spf and avoid sun, and u r good to go.  :)</li>
    <li> Great product worth the money every time.</li>
    <li> Let me be clear that I LOVE this product, however the one I ordered recently was a fake, no question  about it.  Came without a box and was totally clear (it usually has a faint brownish color).  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Diluted product. Listen to the warnings, this is not the true formula. The product is excellent, this seller alters that product</li>
</ol>
