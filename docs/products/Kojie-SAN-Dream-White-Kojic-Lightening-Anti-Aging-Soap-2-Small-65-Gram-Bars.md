      <li>I am happy that I made this purchase</li>
      <li>Not as good as the orange one</li>
      <li>But otherwise its worth the investment to having beautiful even skin tone!</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t seem too drying.</li>
      <li>Nice soap.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST effective skin lightening soap I have purchased thus far.</li>
      <li>I love this product it makes my skin look so nice after I use it.</li>
      <li>cant see much of a difference.. came in time great seller to do business with..</li>
      <li>Better than the Orange one.</li>
      <li>I have read through most of the reviews on here</li>
      <li>Anyway I will be ordering more once I&#x27;m done with these bars.</li>
      <li>After a week of using this product, I noticed my skin got more lighter.</li>
      <li>and I am planning to order more.</li>
      <li>The orange one works better</li>
      <li>No lightening for sure</li>
      <li>Will probably order more.</li>
      <li>Most of my friends like to have tan skin</li>
      <li>Surprisingly after the FIRST week of use my fiance noticed the color of my skin drastically lightened, smoothed, and evenly toned.</li>
      <li>Afterwards, you should use a moisturizer to smooth out the skin.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and how easily it lathers, you don&#x27;t have to use that much at all.</li>
      <li>I believe you should leave it on there for 1-2 minutes and then quickly rinse it off with water.</li>
      <li>your skin will be more sensitive if you do that.</li>
      <li>It is really worth the investment.</li>
      <li>It is worth the money.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not as strong as the normal Koije san</li>
      <li>Make sure you use a good sunscreen with it as it seems to leave your skin a little sensitive to the sun.</li>
      <li>I get better results when I lightly exfoliate first, but be careful cus</li>
      <li>but my skin feels really clean and soft</li>
      <li>Excellent Product, my skin looks younger and more radiant since I been using this, just a warning not to used for long periods I would recommend only twice a week, since it can over dry the skin!</li>
      <li>Kind of clears dark skin spots.</li>
      <li>My skin is neither too light nor too tan but in the middle.</li>
      <li>Soap is really soft to the skin and it lathers really well!  </li>
      <li>Instead, just splash your face with water and pat dry with a clean towel.</li>
      <li>It stings a bit, but my face and body is really soft!</li>
      <li>Smooth skin with a glow, but can&#x27;t get rid of the dark spots   yet.</li>
      <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>but if you have sensitive skin be cautious.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update on how the whitening is later, but for now I really like it</li>
      <li>I have natural oily skin, and this takes off all the excess oil.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the BEST effective skin lightening soap I have purchased thus far. Iam a African american female with medium brown skin. I have age spots on each side of my cheeks and scars on my face. Surprisingly after the FIRST week of use my fiance noticed the color of my skin drastically lightened, smoothed, and evenly toned. I use it both day and night! I follow behind wash with Ambi fade cream. Iam so happy I found a combination that WORKS!! Will stay stocked with soap because it does melt fast and the bars are small. But otherwise its worth the investment to having beautiful even skin tone!</li>
    <li> This soap has no effect at all in lightening age spots or skin discolorations</li>
    <li> Nice soap. Better than the Orange one.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for a while and it works well.i ill order it again.</li>
    <li> I have natural oily skin, and this takes off all the excess oil. It stings a bit, but my face and body is really soft! I&#x27;ll update on how the whitening is later, but for now I really like it</li>
    <li> This soap does work in lightening the skin. It does take some time though to work. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I used the soap daily. Smooth skin with a glow, but can&#x27;t get rid of the dark spots   yet. Can anyone help me out?  Been using it for over two month now.</li>
    <li> I bought it for whitening my skin. It can only make my skin dry nothing Seles other functions as seller described. Not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, my skin looks younger and more radiant since I been using this, just a warning not to used for long periods I would recommend only twice a week, since it can over dry the skin!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening but my skin feels really clean and soft that&#x27;s why it getsonly two stars from me.</li>
    <li> The orange one works better</li>
    <li> This product did not work I was highly disappointed ! I would like something that would actually work for me !</li>
    <li> Not as good as the orange one but it did the job</li>
    <li> This soap works well. I have olive skin and had a few brown patches on my face. I have been using twice a day and my complexion seems smoother and the spots are less noticeable. It has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t seem too drying. The bars are small so I keep it in an airtight soap dish to conserve. Make sure you use a good sunscreen with it as it seems to leave your skin a little sensitive to the sun.</li>
    <li> Kind of clears dark skin spots.</li>
    <li> This soap is a waste of money 💰! It does not lighten or cleanse your skin.  I am very disappointed and upset</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my skin look so nice after I use it. The bars are small but if you keep it dry I&#x27;d say each can last a month, since I&#x27;ve been on one bar for about 3 weeks. Also remember this is a kojic acid soap , it&#x27;s not as strong as the normal Koije san but if you have sensitive skin be cautious. If it stings me I rinse it off. Using this, especially after a long day out and about, my face and skin looks brighter. I&#x27;m black with med brown/caramel skin and using it makes my skin look kinda \\&quot;fair\\&quot; which goes away a little after awhile.. I get better results when I lightly exfoliate first, but be careful cus your skin will be more sensitive if you do that. I love the smell and how easily it lathers, you don&#x27;t have to use that much at all. Anyway I will be ordering more once I&#x27;m done with these bars.</li>
    <li> All I can say is that this product does give you a lighter skin. I have read through most of the reviews on here and I decided to try it myself. Most of my friends like to have tan skin but I didn&#x27;t find that attractive. My skin is neither too light nor too tan but in the middle. I also have sensitive skin and I been using products to treat my acne on my cheeks. There are still scars and blemishes visible. I decided to give this product a shot. After a week of using this product, I noticed my skin got more lighter. My scars and blemishes started to fade. It also made my skin glow. I am happy that I made this purchase and I am planning to order more. The bar itself is quite small but it is inexpensive. I must also warn you that this soap can dry out your skin. I don&#x27;t recommend letting it dry on your skin because it&#x27;ll cause your pores to be trapped which leads to a face breakout. I believe you should leave it on there for 1-2 minutes and then quickly rinse it off with water. Never rub your face with your hands otherwise it will irritate the skin. Instead, just splash your face with water and pat dry with a clean towel. Afterwards, you should use a moisturizer to smooth out the skin. I hope you guys find this review helpful. It is really worth the investment.</li>
    <li> didnt see any change. I did receive cracks in the side of my lip no change in my face. will try the other one and see what results I get. No lightening for sure</li>
    <li> Soap is really soft to the skin and it lathers really well!  As for lightening the skin, I don&#x27;t notice a difference but I like the way it feels on my face.  Will probably order more.</li>
    <li> cant see much of a difference.. came in time great seller to do business with.. im still on the fence and im still using it for my dark spots</li>
