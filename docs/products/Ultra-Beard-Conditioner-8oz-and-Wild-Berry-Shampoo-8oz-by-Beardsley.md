      <li>I absolutely love the smell....</li>
      <li>First off, this smells amazing!</li>
      <li>I wanted something that had a manly smell, and something that I hoped would make my beard softer and more manageable.</li>

      <li>The shampoo gets my beard pretty clean, although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as my wife&#x27;s shampoo.  </li>
      <li>But the conditioner cleans it up okay for days when I skip the shampoo and leaves my beard nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I ordered this thinking it would fit my needs, but it</li>
      <li>My brother loves his silky smooth beard.</li>
      <li>These products are absolutely fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Plus an added bonus is the smell, Ladies his beard will smell AMAZING and he will love all the extra attention his beard gets from you :)</li>
      <li>they remove the beard oils and balms leaving my skin and beard smooth wifey</li>

      <li>I am definitely not disappointed with my purchase</li>
      <li>so excited to get this,</li>
      <li>Specially for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super excited.</li>
      <li>So I bought this for my boyfriend and we both love how the smell is not strong but his beard still smells good.</li>
      <li>I keep pretty clean and brush my beard every day, of course, but cleaning is a must.</li>
      <li>they leave a soft and healthy beard and moustache.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so much more manageable and soft now.</li>
      <li>This stuff leaves my beard hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>and he was right</li>
      <li>so it has gotten quite long and abundant.</li>
      <li>Not worth the money for me, but it does smell good.</li>
      <li>But, do they work better than regular shampoo and conditioner, and are they worth the money?  </li>
      <li>really makes a difference to the look and feel of the beard and mustache!</li>
      <li>First I thought I&#x27;ll get it with another delivery which didn&#x27;t happen....</li>
      <li>this was my first time using any product spcifically for beards.</li>
      <li>We will be back to buy more.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s kind of weird, but the shampoo actually tastes really good (like berries!).</li>
      <li>Only takes a dab, so I think price will be economical in the end, seemed high at first, but pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>Son likes it but also wants to look into beard oil since he had skin rash under his beard.</li>
      <li>If you have an Epic beard like mine and want to keep it fresh use Beardsley.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference of softness in his beard since he started using this.</li>
      <li>for the taste, does any guy really care?  </li>
      <li>My husband absolutely LOVES this stuff.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Leave the beard soft and fresh</li>
      <li>Very unimpressed.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this.  </li>
      <li>Really, who cares?</li>
      <li>I like it very much&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>Conditioner not too heavy but effective.  </li>
      <li>I used to just use conditioner every other day or so in the early stages of beardom, keeping it soft and nice smelling</li>
      <li>I do construction work and mainly masonry the lime in the mortar</li>
      <li>Will definitely order again, it even arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>My beard feels very soft and looks very refreshed.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>My husbands beard is soft!!  </li>
      <li>and my beard will be so stiff and tangled at the end of most work days.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this because I was wanting to try something new.  </li>
      <li>Works exactly the same as the stuff I was using on my hair before I bought this just for my beard.</li>
      <li>Beard wash lathers up nicely and a little goes a long way for both conditioner and wash.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t use them more often is because my beard is usually a little shorter on days</li>
      <li>Well, as soft as wirey beard hair can be...</li>
      <li>I get that it&#x27;s supposed to taste like wild berries, but come on.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m naturally oily).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Once it got pretty long, I grabbed up some of the shampoo as well</li>
      <li>Ultra beard wash and conditioner does leave my beard soft however</li>
      <li>its soft now...</li>
      <li>The problem was he would get these really tender spot on his skin under his beard where there would be ingrown hairs and just dry sore skin.</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t followed up with how the product actually works except that he said it makes his berd soft</li>
      <li>He is using this on regular bases now and his beard looks shiny and feels soft</li>
      <li>A little goes a really long way and really does the job without completely drying out the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My husband absolutely LOVES this stuff. He started growing out his beard a few years ago and just used your average shampoo and conditioner on his beard. The problem was he would get these really tender spot on his skin under his beard where there would be ingrown hairs and just dry sore skin. After I got him this for Christmas, NO MORE! He has used this exclusively for his beard since Christmas and we are still on the same bottles 4 months later. A little goes a really long way and really does the job without completely drying out the skin. We will be back to buy more. Plus an added bonus is the smell, Ladies his beard will smell AMAZING and he will love all the extra attention his beard gets from you :)</li>
    <li> It works really well, and I loved the smell!</li>
    <li> Very unimpressed. I&#x27;ve been wanting shampoo and conditioner for my beard. I wanted something that had a manly smell, and something that I hoped would make my beard softer and more manageable. I ordered this thinking it would fit my needs, but it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The good - the shampoo lathers well and my beard feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;The bad - the smell isn&#x27;t bad and doesn&#x27;t linger, but it&#x27;s not a manly smell. I could&#x27;ve got the same smell with herbal essence.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is less soft than it was, and harder to manage. I have been having to use beard oil just to take it. Previously, I only used oil occasionally just to treat my beard (I&#x27;m naturally oily).&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe my head and shoulders 2 in 1 takes better care of my beard. And it doesn&#x27;t cost $26.&lt;br /&gt;Was so excited to get this, but I&#x27;m very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> a must have for all bearded men, both the conditioner and the shampoo works great. they leave a soft and healthy beard and moustache.</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubby&#x27;s birthday and he likes the was it makes his beard feel but it smells like puke when he told me this I had to smell it for myself and he was right it smelled like puke</li>
    <li> It took a couple of weeks to see the results. .but its soft now...my beard is grey a nd a couple of inches long..</li>
    <li> Previous to this I had only tried only one other brand of beard wash and conditioner.  I purchased this because I was wanting to try something new.  I will say that it does smell pretty good.  The shampoo lathers up really well and does a good job cleaning my beard.  The conditioner on the other hand, I feel like any other regular hair conditioner would work just as well.  I am definitely not disappointed with my purchase but I don&#x27;t know if this will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product from now on.</li>
    <li> I like it very much&lt;br /&gt;Very good products for beard&lt;br /&gt;Nice small and lots of bubbles&lt;br /&gt;Leave the beard soft and fresh</li>
    <li> I have been letting my beard grow for about two years so it has gotten quite long and abundant. this was my first time using any product spcifically for beards. Very nice product, leaves my beard soft and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review for my boyfriend. I purchased this for him as a birthday gift. First off, this smells amazing! I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference of softness in his beard since he started using this.</li>
    <li> These products are absolutely fabulous.  My beard feels very soft and looks very refreshed.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have been using for quite awhile.  Gentle but cleans great.  Conditioner not too heavy but effective.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend who just started growing his beard then. He is using this on regular bases now and his beard looks shiny and feels soft</li>
    <li> My husbands beard is soft!!  I ordered these for him on his birthday, and he&#x27;s been using it daily.  really makes a difference to the look and feel of the beard and mustache!</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference in this shampoo on my beard. I have been using it for several weeks but I feel like my hair shampoo would have delivered the same result. Not worth the money for me, but it does smell good.</li>
    <li> When I got my order I received only one item,obviously there were supposed to be a conditioner and a shampoo. First I thought I&#x27;ll get it with another delivery which didn&#x27;t happen....when I tried to track it it said it was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;They refunded me...which didn&#x27;t solve the problem because I needed the entire order...they suggested to place another order,when I asked if I&#x27;ll get it with my next purchase the customer serv rep said that it&#x27;s a third party and they don&#x27;t guarantee it!</li>
    <li> Ultra beard wash and conditioner does leave my beard soft however, I don&#x27;t care for the scent.  It&#x27;s not horrible but I just cannot get used to it.  Beard wash lathers up nicely and a little goes a long way for both conditioner and wash.  A really nice product and it works, I am giving 4 stars only because I did not prefer the scent.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 2 years now on my 2.5 year-old beard. I used to just use conditioner every other day or so in the early stages of beardom, keeping it soft and nice smelling Once it got pretty long, I grabbed up some of the shampoo as well and I use them both together on my beard maybe once a week now. I keep pretty clean and brush my beard every day, of course, but cleaning is a must. The only reason I don&#x27;t use them more often is because my beard is usually a little shorter on days I&#x27;ve shampooed it. But seriously these things smell great and leave the beard nice and soft and nice smelling! And it&#x27;s kind of weird, but the shampoo actually tastes really good (like berries!). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend swallowing any of it, but when it gets in your mouth, it&#x27;s not unpleasant in the slightest!</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for all the men with beards in my family (bought 3 sets).  All seem to like it, no issues with fragrance.  Hubby&#x27;s beard seems softer.  Son likes it but also wants to look into beard oil since he had skin rash under his beard.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because people complained about the smell.... I&#x27;m so glad I did!! My husband has a beard quite similar to the conditioner bottle and it&#x27;s so much more manageable and soft now. I absolutely love the smell.... His beard has actually thickened since he started using this product. Will definitely order again, it even arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> It does what it says on the tin. I don&#x27;t always use the shampoo, even when I use the conditioner. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the shampoo, I just don&#x27;t like to shampoo every day. But the conditioner cleans it up okay for days when I skip the shampoo and leaves my beard nice and soft. The smell doesn&#x27;t last after my beard dries, but I don&#x27;t mind that. The smell is very nice in the shower, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to smell like that with clothes on.</li>
    <li> My brother loves his silky smooth beard.</li>
    <li> son likes it for his beard said it works.</li>
    <li> Really like the way my beard feels after I am done with a good cleaning with these Beardsley products.  Only takes a dab, so I think price will be economical in the end, seemed high at first, but pretty satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I have a thick, ginger beard and have been looking for something to get it under control.  I&#x27;ve been using my wife&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, and just thought I&#x27;d try picking up something intended specifically for beards.  I wash my beard every morning.  Can&#x27;t stand not too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do these products work?  Yeah.  I guess so.  But, do they work better than regular shampoo and conditioner, and are they worth the money?  I don&#x27;t think so.  The shampoo gets my beard pretty clean, although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as my wife&#x27;s shampoo.  The conditioner is pretty good, too, but again, not as good as my wife&#x27;s Aussie 3 Minute miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used up both bottles now, and won&#x27;t be spending the money again.  Overall, if you&#x27;re using soap, this is a step up.  But there is way cheaper stuff that does a better job cleaning and conditioning my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the taste, does any guy really care?  I get that it&#x27;s supposed to taste like wild berries, but come on.  I&#x27;m half asleep in the shower, anyway, and don&#x27;t typically drink the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I&#x27;ll use this stuff up, but will probably just go back to using whatever my wife buys for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it taste good?  Really, who cares?</li>
    <li> Great! It works awesome!</li>
    <li> These smell amazing! I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and now I can&#x27;t wait to smell his beard. As strange as that sounds. I&#x27;m super excited. lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beardsley products for a while now. The Wildberry flavor is awesome the Cantaloupe is good too I own both they remove the beard oils and balms leaving my skin and beard smooth wifey loves it, the conditioner is the BEST IMO. This stuff leaves my beard hair soft and healthy. If you have an Epic beard like mine and want to keep it fresh use Beardsley.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this.  I hate his beard but it is much softer and more manageable with these products :)</li>
    <li> This was a gag gift and I haven&#x27;t followed up with how the product actually works except that he said it makes his berd soft</li>
    <li> Cleans the beard. Makes the beard softer... Well, as soft as wirey beard hair can be... Doesn&#x27;t smell like girly-ass shampoo.</li>
    <li> Very good.  Odd that the shampoo is flavored, who gets it in their mouth?</li>
    <li> I do construction work and mainly masonry the lime in the mortar we work with dries everything out and my beard will be so stiff and tangled at the end of most work days.  Both the shampoo and condition do an excellent job of cleaning and then conditioning my bread into a manageable beard again. They both have a good smell and my wife approved of results and smell across the board.</li>
    <li> So I bought this for my boyfriend and we both love how the smell is not strong but his beard still smells good. Specially for me. His beard definitely looks healthier than before he used it.</li>
    <li> It made my face itch and my lips tingle really bad. I stopped using. It&#x27;s not hypoallergenic so just keep that in mind. It did make my beard soft and cut down on the flakes.</li>
    <li> Works exactly the same as the stuff I was using on my hair before I bought this just for my beard.</li>
