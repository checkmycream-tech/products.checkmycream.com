    <li> I have tried several hair products/gels over the years, both natural and not, without satisfying results.  I have even tried making my own homemade flax seed gel which did not work as well on my hair, it was very messy, and did not have a very long shelf life.  I just got this gel in the mail yesterday and I already love it.  I have curly hair but frequently flat iron it.  I immediately put the gel on my dry hair and flat ironed.  My hair was so soft, bouncy, shiny, and smooth.  It looked almost as though I just came from the salon and had a wonderful blow out and style.  My husband even asked what I changed about my hair because he said it looked really &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;.  I am looking forward to using this after I shower on wet hair so I can see the curly hair results that everyone else is raving about.  I feel good using a natural product by bwc.  I decided to use this gel because I already use their light daily benefits conditioner and I love it for conditioning and as a leave in, too.</li>
    <li> Unscented and light spray, used wet or dry as a hairspray. My fine curly hair is fully, shiny, bouncy. No animal testing or ingredients, obviously, so all in all I will be buying this amazing spray again.</li>
    <li> The best gel I have ever found.</li>
    <li> great for adding a little texture to fine, wavy hair.  Doesn&#x27;t get too heavy or sticky.  Spray on wet or dry (thought sprayed on dry hair does make it a little moist)</li>
    <li> I am extremely diligent about buying products with low toxin levels.I had checked the Skin Deep database and this had one of the lowest ratings for spray gel, which is great! We have used it a few times and it works great.The 1 star downgrade is for price. I know for cleaner products we tend to pay out the nose, but its a bit pricey. I think it is well worth it and will continue to be a costumer but I hope they figure out a way to lower the product even if its just a little, but immensely appreciate the product that they offer. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good because it doesnt cause me or my husband a headache if i dont have time to wash it out before bed!</li>
    <li> Volume Plus Spray has been for two years the greatest product I have found to keep my hair from being baby fine and lifeless.  I don&#x27;t like to coat my hair down with hair spray, so this spray gel does an excellent job in giving my hair the volume I need without feeling like it&#x27;s glued to my head.  I always keep an extra bottle on hand, so I don&#x27;t ever have to be without it.  An excellent buy for the price.  It&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I like the non aerosol application and the product does what it claims and leaves the hair&lt;br /&gt;firm but not stiff like some of the other leading brands.  I will definitely purchase this product&lt;br /&gt;again.</li>
    <li> Good for adding a bit of control, volume and some leave in conditioning to fine, curly hair without a strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> Fantastic gel spray, never disappoints. Been using for years, try other products and always go back to BWC. Thank you.</li>
    <li> NO animal testing on the BWC (Beauty Without Cruelty) products!  This particular product over exceeds my expectations.  Love it!  Will definitely be replacing my Aveda volumizing tonic .. better product, more for your money.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to find a good all-natural hair spray. I have tried both the blue and red bottles from BWC. I find that both hold my hair well, with the red bottle giving me a more straw-like feeling and the blue bottle not being quite as effective. However, the blue bottle is unscented, whereas the red one smells like hairspray. Overall, I recommend this version as it works and doesn&#x27;t make my hair stink</li>
    <li> very nice product.  shipping was quite fast.</li>
    <li> It works much better than I had expected an all natural product to work.  Smells great &amp; has a very clean feeling about it.</li>
    <li> I got it for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t really hold my hair like a gel or hairspray. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything. It seems to hold more if I spray on dry hair rather than wet.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works pretty decent with my curls. My only complaint is that on humid days, my curls fall a bit flat. I wish there was a spray gel or mousse for curly hair</li>
    <li> The BWC Gel Spray arrived on time and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I found this to be drying.</li>
    <li> Works on my hair very well, I like this brand.</li>
