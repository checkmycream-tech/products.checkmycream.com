<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful. I was amazed with the results. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> Love the tingle. Tans very well. Stuff is legit.</li>
    <li> I hate this lotion. It burned my skin and did not recieve the color I was hoping for. This is not a tingle more like burning lotion.</li>
    <li> I love the Ruby tanning lotion! It is the EXACT same product as what is sold in tanning salons for over $90! I went to my chain tanning place and tested a packet on one half of my body and this lotion on the other half and the results were identical. This is an absolute steal! The tingle effect is much more like a bad sunburn but goes away after an hour or two. The redness is expected, but I&#x27;m a bit embarrassed to run errands after using it. The best recommendation I have is to use it in a stand up bed! Otherwise, your bum will feel like it&#x27;s on fire! This product does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do: It&#x27;s a tingling and reddening lotion. Not for the faint of heart or inexperienced tanner. I only use this every other time I tan because you don&#x27;t need it anymore than that. I&#x27;m Greek so I tan well anyways, and this lotion makes me darker than any summer in the Greek Isles ever could.</li>
    <li> I have always used Bombshell by Designer skin. , but wanted to try some of their other tanning lotions. Wooooooooooooooooooww!!!!! this is even better than Bombshell. I love the smell also. Warning tho , only use if u have a base tan. It does have  the tingle factor it it.And it does get hot!!! ty Designer Skin  u hit a home run with this!!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite indoor tanning lotion.  If you can stand the hot tingle factor that this lotion gives, it is well worth it!  I tan super fast using this.  The 2nd biggest perk with this lotion is my local tanning salon (major tanning salon chain) sells this same bottle in store for $96!!!!</li>
    <li> This gives you a great tan. I have a high pain tolerance so the &#x27;tingling&#x27; or burning, didn&#x27;t really bother me..it was the EXTREME itchiness afterward. I mean, this stuff means business..I would itch ALL over..and it would not go away unless I completely scrubbed myself in the shower with a loofa. Also, I&#x27;m not one to just try things once and say I dont like it. I gave it a good 4 tries before throwing it away and getting something else.</li>
    <li> Their shipping speed was excellent. The product itself was not up to par. I have used samples of this lotion at my salon and it was epically hot! Tingle was severe. I felt the heat for up to 8 hours following use. However, when I received this product and used it, none of this was experienced. I felt nothing. I feel as though it created more of a barrier opposed to bringing the melanin to the surface of my skin. I wasn&#x27;t &#x27;ruby red&#x27;. I didn&#x27;t tingle. Nothing. I am certain this product is not legit.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I thought it was a very hot tanning lotion but it isn&#x27;t. Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> It does not Tingle like the ones I&#x27;ve had before. I don&#x27;t think it work as good as some I&#x27;ve had before but it&#x27;s ok. Would not buy this one again will try a different one from designer skin because I do love some other ones they put out</li>
    <li> I just tried ruby for the first time today and I already look darker. I was bright red after tanning and showering was even worse but after my skin cooled I&#x27;m a perfect bronze color. Can&#x27;t wait to use this a few more times!! So worth it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing...but only for an experienced tanner. Color is amazing and smells great! The tingle is very strong and does last a while even if you wash your hands so beware if you touch your face or other people because it will rub off. Definitely a legit product as I bought a bottle from the tanning salon for $95 and compared the two...exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of us, I&#x27;m very pale natuarally. So pale that I could never find a foundation light enough to match my skin tone. Yea, I glow in the dark by nature. It takes me months to move a shade (even if I burn, which takes hours) I can go in a cyclone on full time and not burn. But I&#x27;ve been tanning for years, so now I have a base even if I stop going for a month (like I would...) but I love Ruby, and have been using it since sometime in January. I bought mine from the salon and have only ever used designer skin products since I bought Color Bomb two years ago.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I&#x27;m used to sizzles and this one does still get me sometimes. You have to be careful to put your goggles on before you touch the lotion, but that should be obvious, otherwise it&#x27;ll end up in your eyes which... doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as it should anymore. I&#x27;m a fan of the out of the bottle smell but I don&#x27;t particularly like what it turns into by the end of the day. I have noticed it does need to sit a while in order to really get the color to stick otherwise some of it will run down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;Like I mentioned earlier I have a pretty good base on at all times. If you need a reference I&#x27;m usually something like a sandy beige in foundation. After not going to the salon for a few weeks I did downgrade in color quite a bit. I was so disappointed but after popping in today (20 min in an ultra Broz) I&#x27;m back to my usual base color which is probably 3 or 4 shades in one session.&lt;br /&gt;Ruby works well for building up to a deep gold, but I usually plateau after that point and upgrade to a higher sizzle. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recomend this product to someone who doesn&#x27;t have a base or is not experienced with a sizzle (last thing you want is to run out naked screaming youre on fire lol). I still use this and its definitely one of my favorites, but in my experience its only good for a certain point in time in tour tanning.</li>
    <li> Great color. Very hot cinnamon tingle. Be careful if you&#x27;re not used to tingle.</li>
    <li> In love! Deff will be ordering from here again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Love it , don&#x27;t use it on your face tho you&#x27;ll regret it lol. But wouldn&#x27;t recommend if your a first time tingle user.</li>
    <li> Instant results!! Great lotion</li>
    <li> My tanning salon has signs up warning against buying tanning lotions online - I paid $10 for a sample of this lotion (after a discount from the salon!) to make sure I&#x27;d like a tingle cream before I bought this. I absolutely love this, it tans faster and doesn&#x27;t have too much bronzer, plus the price is WAY BETTER than the $117 they want for it at the salon!</li>
    <li> Gives a nice, deep tan. A warning to newbies (as I was one when I bought this). It does hurt! It is not a comfortable experience the first time. I recommend starting with just the legs to see how you may feel when you put it on more sensitive skin like on your belly. DO NOT PUT THIS ON YOUR FACE! I did. And I ran out of the tanning bed because it hurt so badly. I felt like I had a killer sunburn with the feverishness and the chills. If you decide that you can take the heat after testing on your legs, go for it! I have no problems now, and my tan is so much darker.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, hands down!  I am an experienced tanner and this product takes the cake...thanks Ruby Designer Skin!</li>
    <li> If you wanna smell like fruit gushers when you tan this smells just like it.&lt;br /&gt;I now only tan 2x a week to stay dark.&lt;br /&gt;I love the sizzle feeling</li>
    <li> If you like hot tingle, you&#x27;ll love this. Just make sure to Keep it away from your eyes! The hottest I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Ouchkabibble! I was literally laying in bed thinking I&#x27;m so tough. I&#x27;ve used tons of tingle lotions before so her i am thinking I&#x27;m some tough she-rah, lord of tingle lotions!!! Rawr!!! What starts off as a warming quickly turns into a owe! It feels like a sunburn! Aannndd you feel chilled at the same time?! Odd! And yes you turn red after &amp;#60;_&amp;#60; but wow on the after bronze! Worth it. Just be a she-rah ; )</li>
    <li> This is the best tingle I have ever tried. Gives you AMAZING color. Definitely do not use this is you have never used a tingle or are just starting out with tingles! Smells like candy!</li>
    <li> Same stuff that you buy at tanning salon, half the price! Worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; Delivery, Im very Happy with my purchase, I would order again :-)  Very Hot tingle just what I was looking for,</li>
    <li> It was great. Exactly how I remembered it! I would definetly recommend this to other tanners who like the heat! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Perfect perfect perfect, there&#x27;s no way I could have found it at any better price! Thx! Ill be back when this RUBY is gone</li>
    <li> It was diluted with something else not actual product</li>
    <li> Recently, a friend allowed me to try this product before purchasing.  I tanned IMMEDIATELY!  After exfoliating my skin, I apply generously, then blow dry, go to bed, and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; my linens!  Great to use with upcoming events and there is no time for long-term tanning beds, which is bad for your skin anyway. However, I have used it immediately before getting into a tanning bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will literally take your breath away upon use, and tingle your skin!  I do make certain not to get it too close to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this is my number 1 skin bronzer!</li>
    <li> Great! Same stuff that&#x27;s in the salon :)&lt;br /&gt;So glad I made the choice to come on Amazon to get this after different reviews I just went with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 100% real deal and HOT lol I love it and gets me dark.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion, so fruity and delicious, and no ATO. However, several hours after tanning i noticed the smell of the bronzers, that self tanner smell. Also i thought the couple reviewers on here that said the fumes screwed with them were crazy, but when i apply this lotion, the fumes seem to burn my eyes and make me sneeze. But after just one session I am noticeably darker, and the tingle is crazy intense.the cooling effect want that noticeable, but it did feel sorta like peppermint oil on my body. Over all i really love this lotion and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchace :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really feel the cooling effect it says it has but it is a really great lotion, bottle lasted a lot longer than my other lotions.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t what they said it was! I felt absolutely no tingle, and didn&#x27;t get red at all! In my opinion what I recieved was either expired Orr watered down with something else. I will not purchase this product or any others on line again! Very disappointed!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Best Tingler ever made. However I can not stress enough to mix a dime size amount with a bronzer as this product is extremely HOT! I made the mistake of putting on my whole body like a lotion and was the color of a tomato and almost passed out from the heat!</li>
    <li> Hot and gives you a good tan!</li>
    <li> I literally did not even want to give this one star because of how mad I am about this lotion.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not sure if the people who are writing these “AHHHHMAZING” reviews work for this company or are just plain stupid, but this lotion is NOT what it claims to be. Maybe I got a defective bottle, but I highly doubt that. How long exactly would it have to sit on a shelf for it to be defective YEARS? Seems a little strange to me…. Now I’m new to the whole “tingle” tanning lotions, but when I first used my JWoww lotion, I could TELL that it was a tingle lotion. Now that I’ve gotten used to that tingle and seeing as I was almost out, I thought, why not? I’ll try this one! The first couple reviews I read said that it was an awesome product and a couple people even said that they almost had to or did get out of the tanning bed before the time was up due to the heat from the lotion. I ordered the lotion and anxiously awaited its arrival. I like the benefits of the tingle lotion and the heat from them doesn’t bother me, so I figured the more the better! When I got my lotion, I was excited and went to the salon the next day. Due to the reviews, I was a little nervous about putting the lotion all over, so I just put it on my legs. I got into the stand up and turned it on… A few minutes in I was still wondering when this “EXTREME HEAT” was going to start… 12 minutes later, STILL NOTHING. There was absolutely ZERO tingle/heat/even bronzer in this lotion. The ONLY thing that was true about it was the smell. I am absolutely 300% not satisfied and filled out to return it the first business day (today) that I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A JOKE!!!! I have never written a mean review in my life, but this was absolutely ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either this seller is a joke and/or the people reviewing this product are straight up lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if the second is true, seriously. Get a life.</li>
    <li> The same as what you would purchase in a tanning salon, just a lot less expensive. Works very well if you are already tan but need to boost yourself over that tanning plateau we all reach.</li>
    <li> Got this for my Mom and she loves it.  She uses it every time she goes to the tanning bed.  Ruby helps you achieve your maximum tan.</li>
    <li> worth the money and ships fast!!!!!</li>
    <li> i love it its amazing it i love it its amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it im super satisfied with it love love love worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it im super satisfied with it love love love</li>
    <li> Excellent, received way before estimated delivery date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, this is HOTTT!! It was the first tingle lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought. Listen to the other reviews, though. If you aren&#x27;t an experienced tanner, and that means beyond having a base tan, or haven&#x27;t had kuch experience with tingle lotions, then I don&#x27;t recommend this. I put it on before I went to the tanning bed. I was ON FIRE. When I got there, I could barely stand it, and only did 20 mins in a regular stand up bed. I also recommend using the stand up beds until your skin starts to adapt to this lotion. The second time I used it, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; nearly as bad. Once you get used to it, you should be able to use the lay down beds. I only applied it to my arms, legs, stomach, and chest. Not my butt, or back. I likely won&#x27;t put it on my chest again, though. Too intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, It did tan me pretty well. I was beyond a base tan when I used it. It did give me some great color, though! If you think you&#x27;re up for the first time or two of the worst burn in your life, I say go for it, because it&#x27;s a GREAT lotion, but be warned, it&#x27;s BEYOND hot! Think of it like your worst sunburn times 5!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products and mostly from Designer Skin, the maker of Ruby...this stuff was TERRIBLE. Tingler is never an issue for me, this stuff scorched my skin to the point where it hurt...to make matters worse after two days my skin was this bright NEON fake looking dirty spray tan color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was not impressed and probably will never purchase another Designer Skin product...You expect quality in a lotion that cost 30 bucks.</li>
    <li> If you love tingle you&#x27;ll love Ruby</li>
    <li> Great color, tingle is intense.</li>
    <li> This is a really intense tingle lotion! It gives fast beautiful results but I do not recommend it unless you are an advanced tanner... unless you mix it half/half or 25/75 with another lotion but even then it&#x27;s still pretty intense. I personally love it. If I don&#x27;t want to feel the super intense tingle that this lotion gives you or have stuff to do and don&#x27;t want to walk around town with my skin bright red then I mix it with a regular tanning lotion and it still works really well.</li>
    <li> When using this I was a bit nervous for the tingle. The first time using it I only did my hips down, and it burned like no other! I turned so red and burned for the next two hours and failed to feel and cooling effect. But the tan was definitely worth it. I just got done using I the second time except I put on my entire body except my face and it barely tingled, I turned bright red as expected but I think my body is now used to it. One thing to avoid though would be your lady parts, my nips and down south got some lotion on them which is an annoying pain not to mention it hurts. This time around I could feel the cooling effect much more. I&#x27;m not sitting on the couch bundled up cause I&#x27;m so cold and have goose bumps. To sum it up this lotion is amazing, it&#x27;s not too thick and has a great smell. If your looking for fast color this is the lotion for you! And trust me the first time sucks, but try it a few more times to decided wether you like it or not(:</li>
    <li> As far as the seller&#x27;s service goes, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I ordered this product on a Monday and received it on a Wednesday - it came from CA and I live on the east coast, so needless to say it got here a lot faster than I thought it would, and I paid the same for what was apparently 2-day shipping that I would normally pay for standard 3-5 day shipping.  Not only that, but the seller included a coupon for my next order, as well as a sample packet of another popular tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is amazing.  At first I was worried that it may not be a legitimate product (simply because of the price difference - this bottle is $90 at the tanning salon I go to), but after only one use I am thoroughly impressed.  Everything about it, from the great smell to the HOT tingle, is exactly the same as the sample packet I tried.  So far I&#x27;ve used it twice and already have noticeable color, and it really does smell wonderful!  It doesn&#x27;t have that nasty after tan smell you get with some lotions.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves a good tingle lotion and is looking to break through their tanning plateau.</li>
    <li> This lotion is alright. I&#x27;d like it more if it didn&#x27;t always leave me red. I&#x27;ve been tanning awhile and never had this problem before. It does leave you tan but you&#x27;ll be red and sensitive for a few hours.</li>
    <li> This is hands down an AMAZING bronzer. You will get very dark, very quick using this... I don&#x27;t know anyone who hasn&#x27;t. This worked soo very well for me and I loved it, but the more I used it, the more intense the tingle got and I ended up feeling almost nauseas. I haven&#x27;t used it since last summer but it does work so well. I&#x27;m sad I can&#x27;t use it anymore. I would still highly recommend to someone who does not have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED MY ORDER PRETTY QUICKLY BUT THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO USE IT, WHICH WAS THE FOLLOWING EVENING IT DID NOT HAVE THE TINGLE LIKE THE ONE I HAD BEEN USING FROM THE TANNING SALON.  I DIDN&#x27;T EVEN GET A FAINT RED.  I AM JUST CURIOUS TO HOW LONG IT WAS SITTING ON THEIR SHELF BEFORE IT WAS SHIPPED TO ME?  IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE A VERY GOOD PRODUCT BUT I FEEL I GOT A DUD BOTTLE.</li>
    <li> love love love love it!!!! it&#x27;s a good tinger for experienced tanners, only use it if you&#x27;re that kind of a tanner!</li>
    <li> I rate this lotion three out of five stars because the great color results slightly outweigh the uncomfortable sensation. This lotion is definitely for experienced tanners and for people who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. I bought this lotion because my best friend recommended me to try a tingle lotion. I figured since I already love designer skin products that I should try Ruby. This lotion is advertised to provide a heating/tingle sensation followed by a cooling sensation; However, I felt no cooling at all. All i felt was an uncomfortable sensation as if someone was pinching me at the most sensitive parts of my body. This lotion did, however, give me great color, but in varied spots on my body due to pressure points in the tanning bed. I&#x27;m hoping my tan will even out after a couple sessions using a stand up bed. Overall, I would recommend this to a friend who enjoys tingle lotions (the smell and color payoff is great), but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> By far, the best tingle/bronzer combination ou there right now!  Definitely recommend it for experienced tanners, like myself. I am only able to make it to the tanning bed 1-2 times a week, but maintain a dark tan with Ruby. The stuff is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> The tingle factor is too strong</li>
    <li> My wife worked for tanning salon and could by at cost multiple brands she picked this product and is extremely happy with product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping well packed and a great price.</li>
    <li> The best color ever, scary at first as I look like a boiled lobster, but one hour later beautiful tan.</li>
    <li> This has a major tingle &amp; I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on your face. I had to get out early only after being in 6 minutes. My face felt like it was on fire &amp; eyes starting to water. I normally use Pink Diamond in the past &amp; think I will stick to that. I am pretty tan &amp; tan easily.</li>
    <li> I use tingle lotions frequently, but Ruby was awesome! It was so hot and just when you think you take it, the cooling effect kicks in! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Smells great, doesnt streak as long as you rub in correctly and helped me tan a lot faster. Would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;d like to say i use tingle lotions fairly frequently most of them don&#x27;t even feel much different to me than regular lotions and those that do usually only burn the first time i use them and after that my skin adjusts.  After i finished using Ruby the first time I would describe the feeling as something like this &amp;#34;think of the spiciest dish you ever ate, then think about the burn when you passed it.  (sorry i know not the prettiest image) now multiply that by ten and all over your body.  I rushed home and jumped in the shower and proceeded to scrub my body down not once not twice but three times.  Finally I got out deciding that  i was only making it worse.  I thought oh no I&#x27;ll never use this product again but then i looked in the mirror and loved what i saw.  The next day I went back and used it again this time I only felt the burn on my face, bum, and armpits but when i got home and showered i once again felt it all over but, I&#x27;m going back again today to use it again.  Basically what is that saying... &amp;#34;beauty is pain&amp;#34; is how i feel about this lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like fruit loops. Nice and thick and easy to spread, does not take much.  First off this stuff is hot from the minute you put it on your skin. Be careful around your vajayjay and nipples, this stuff will et you on fire. Not overpowering on other areas though. It creates a nice reddening of the skin and a great dark tan afterwards. Before you tan you really need to do a sugar scrub to exfoliate your skin so you get no streaking from the bronzer.  Really good stuff and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is the strongest tingler I&#x27;ve ever tried - it definitely lives up to its name &amp;#34;Ruby&amp;#34;. Not even a couple of minutes after applying this lotion, my skin became very hot and very red (that&#x27;s what tinglers do, after all). It felt like my whole body was on fire! If you&#x27;ve never tried a tingler before, I don&#x27;t recommend this lotion unless you are prepared to feel the burn. What&#x27;s also great about &amp;#34;Ruby&amp;#34; is it smells a lot like fruity pebbles and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin smelling like you just came out of the tanning bed. I give this lotion 5/5!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!!! I have tried just about every tingle lotion out there and this one is by far my favorite. If you use tingle lotions a lot your skin tends to get used to them and they seem to lose that tingle effect, but this one had an awesome tingle effect, perfect for breaking a tanning plateau. I highly recommend for any tingle lover.</li>
    <li> If you love intense tingle lotion, this is the best. Gives great color and smells amazing. Not for beginning tanners as it&#x27;s a pretty intense tingle. I personally love tingle lotions and the results from them so this is my go-to.</li>
    <li> I bought this and wish I tried a packet first. This stuff BURNS, and I mean BURNS. By the time the lights of the bed turned on, I was already feeling like I a virgin tanner in a bed for 20 minutes with no lotion. YIKES! it&#x27;s been over an hour and I am still burning. I look darker, but the girls at the salon weren&#x27;t joking when they said it would feel like I had an allergic reaction. I am not sure if I want to suffer like this every time I tan... even if I look darker, immediately. Yikes.</li>
    <li> I tried this in the sample package from the tanning salon, then found it on Amazon for much less! Smells great while putting it on, but the tingle is stronger than the sample pack, but I still love it!</li>
    <li> From the wonderful scent to the power of the tingle - this is the best lotion I&#x27;ve had. And I&#x27;ve tried just about everything too - this one rates as in the top couple - amazing color and worth the money. Don&#x27;t waste your time on other lotions...this is the one you should rely on for the best tan.</li>
    <li> Ruby is a horrible tanning lotion by designer skin. I love designer skin I have used multiple of their tanning lotions before this one and I must say this was such a horrible experience I&#x27;m legitimately angry. The feeling it gives is something like a chemical burn and it gives you huge red and white splotchy patches of skin for hours after you use it. This product is not worth the pain.</li>
    <li> The hot action on this is intense. If you sweat after using this (i.e. Working out) it will reactivate the heat...but your tan does look amazing!</li>
    <li> gift for a friend, SHE adores it but would rather they kept making Mood!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite sizzles! Nice color and has a very pleasant scent! I would definitely recommend it for the experienced tingle users!&lt;br /&gt;I will be a returning purchaser of this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a huge kick to it.  Its not for sensitive skin because it definitely tingles. I stayed red for a couple hours though so you need to plan out when you&#x27;ll be going and what you&#x27;ll be doing after. I was soooo soo dark after using this lotion.  In my opinion it is worth the pain!</li>
    <li> It broke my skin out like it burnt the skin be very careful with it makes you cough an if you get by eyes burns an made my granddaughters skin all red when I kissed an hugged her</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion.It&#x27;s an extreme tingle w/cooling effects. I get really dark but this kicks it up a notch or 3. Designer Skin normal bronzers don&#x27;t show up that well on me but this lotion is the perfect combination. Its not a heavy or thick lotion. It&#x27;s sort of thinnish and it just glides on and sinks in. Do not take a shower for a few hours after using this or you&#x27;ll reactivate the tingle.</li>
    <li> Does Tingle, have used many lotions before, probably my favorite one! It does make you look and feel a little red and burnt, but the outcome after an hour or so is really worth it! Made me look very dark after 1 use! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion. Works amazing. Be careful it&#x27;s hot. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I was worried at first it would be sketch and not the right or legit product. I was pleasantly suprised. Works great but I&#x27;ve been using tingle for years so I&#x27;m used to it. If you not avid tanner I would not use it! For me it works great because I don&#x27;t get to tan a lot so it&#x27;s fabulousness. My tan is quick and lasts. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge DesignerSkin fan! I was never much of a tingle lover until I tried this product. I didn&#x27;t like feeling like I was burning in the bed. But Ruby has cooling technology! So while you&#x27;re laying comfortably in the tanning bed, you feel cool as a pickle. When you get out you&#x27;re a little red...but an hour later...OMG it hurts. But the pain is worth it. I went from base tan-to full fledge tan of the Bahamas in a week (maybe 3x in bed). This stuff is legit.</li>
    <li> Tingle is an understatement!  More like fire all over your body!  I like designer skin products but a tingle is just not for me!</li>
    <li> This is a sizzling lotion that smells really good. I should have tried a packet of sizzling before I bought this because I was on fire and my skin was all red for hours after I tanned! It&#x27;s awesome if you&#x27;re into that kinda thing ;)</li>
    <li> Delivery on time great stuff for tanning bed it has tingle power makes u really dark</li>
    <li> Ruby is awesome.  Thanks for offering it. Love it</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent service. ....HOT HOT HOT TINGLE!</li>
    <li> This lotion is for experienced tanners only! I tan at a popular chain that charges 120.00 a bottle for this. Of course the salon will say its a knock off or expired lotion and that may be true for some lotions but the lotion i ordered and recieved from this seller was the original product. It is by far the best lotion I have used so far. Its called Ruby cause you come out red as a Ruby but hours later developes into a nice rich brown color. If you like a tingle, try it....but be warned your behind is going to feel like its on fire for hours.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but not quite hot enough for me!! I like really hot tingles</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying if you don&#x27;t like tingle or hot tanning lotion do not buy this and who ever weights on here dating they didn&#x27;t like it because it was hot..it clearly says hey on hot..so it&#x27;s how fault. Ok now with that out if the way I LOVE TINGLE OUR HOT TANNING LOTIONS. And I am in love with this lotion!! I love how hot it is it goes on smooth and it smells so good!!! This is one of my favorite lotions. It came sealed  it&#x27;s the real deal! I was very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product. Use it only on my legs which I can never seem to get tan and I am much too fair skinned to use this on my whole body. It burns but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. You can see the difference unlike with regular tanning intensifiers. My legs are always a few shades darker after every use.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best bronzes I have gotten in a long time! I will be buying it here again when needed</li>
    <li> Amazing smell. Nice heat, but not too severe to the point where you&#x27;re uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!&lt;br /&gt;What can I say about RUBY?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my FAVORITE DS lotions of all time!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing. Kinda fruity!! Almost reminds me of Fruity Pebbles &amp; Gummy Bears. Amazing smell. BUT there is a slight ATO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ruby cools you off while in the tanning bed, but about 20-30 minutes after I get out..... WOOOOO!!!! Talk about HOT?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&amp; I mean, so hot that I shiver!!&lt;br /&gt;BUT within an hour or 2, it&#x27;s completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stay red for a while but once the redness goes in, I have an amazing carmel brown color that lasts for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my Ruby in between other lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I alternate days. Skip every other day or every other 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can handle heat &amp; are looking for a GOOD lotion that delivers GREAT COLOR FAST, Ruby is what you need!!!</li>
    <li> So addicted to this product!!! Love it!!! Have tried several products this is the best!!!!!!Have always came back and bought this again and again !</li>
    <li> Very good product.Works really well with my skin</li>
    <li> I just recently started tanning in May. I am very fair-skinned with blonde hair, I burn VERY easily. I started off tanning with JWOWW One and Done and I got a quick base tan then I started using Ruby. I love this! It really tingles and gets you red which some people may complain about, but your body gets used to the tingle over time and the redness turns to a golden dark color within a few hours. I tan 2-3 times per week with this and use AG Body Kisses lotion after I tan and my tan doesn&#x27;t fade and my skin stays hydrated. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion great color it does everything&lt;br /&gt;It says it does. This is my third bottle.i would recommend  this lotion. Love love love it</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion! It smells wonderful and is the real deal! I bought it directly from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not what I tried from the sample packets at the tannery. Very weak. Then I realize, what $100 dollar or more tanning lotion only be 30? Do not buy!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this tanning lotion. The smell, the feel, the results!!!! It honestly smells like skittles. Do be aware that it is a tingle lotion, and it will feel like little needles all over when in the bed. And you will be very red for awhile afterwards. It gets me tan really fast and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This was my wife&#x27;s favorite until I found her something with more tingle. (See my other reviews). If you only want a slight tingle, this is what you want.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion! It gives a very deep color, no orange. The tingle really isn&#x27;t that bad.. I bought from the salon. I don&#x27;t know if I just have a higher tolerance to tingles but this was my first tingle lotion and I used generously and it wasn&#x27;t too bad. Its worst when you get out, your behind feels like you sat on fire lol. Its really not as bad as most people say.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very good too. It smells very sweet and has no bronzer smell to it.</li>
    <li> I just used this product early today about 30 minutes ago and I still feel like I&#x27;m dying. In all honesty I feel like my skin is going to melt off. I&#x27;ve used tingle things before but nothing to this intensity.</li>
    <li> I can say that this is an authentic lotion. I have previously been using Hot Green Tease and it was hot. This is the hottest lotion I have ever used! I could only tan for 7 minutes before I rushed home to take a shower because I was on fire!! It smells great and gets you dark! If you like super hot tingle this is for you. Definitely for an experienced tanner.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not that much of a tingle, it&#x27;s kind of disappointing after reading all of the other reviews. The bronzer part isn&#x27;t too bad though.</li>
    <li> Okay I have been tanning for years. I felt like I stopped getting color.. Bought this product and I swear I was dark after 3 sessions. So worth it.</li>
    <li> I give this lotion ONE star.  I expected great things after reading the reviews, and was very excited to try it out.  I was aware that this lotion has a tingling sensation, but I guess maybe my skin is too sensitive.  I had an all over allergic reaction wherever I had applied this lotion.  I was in the bed for 4 minutes and had to get out because it was burning so terribly.  I literally turned \\&quot;ruby\\&quot; in color.  So, if you happen to be thinking about purchasing this lotion, be cautious if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely fell in love with this lotion. It gives you a dark, natural tan in only a couple uses &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave any funny looking streaks, like some bronzers &amp; Its the best smelling tanning lotion ever, It smells like starbursts and you still smell amazing after tanning.. Lol its an intense tingle lotion, but the cooling effect evens it all out! I highly recommended this lotion, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> When purchasing this item I was expecting it to be super hot and it was not. I didn&#x27;t even feel any tingle and that is what I look for in tanning lotions the hotter the better for me so I was upset that this did not have that. As for the cooling affect I barely felt that and it lasted maybe five mins. Lotion does smell good and after a few uses u can see some color but overall I feel I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> First let me say that this lotion is not for the faint of heart tanners, if you want to go from pale to looking like a blonde Hispanic in about two tans then this is the lotion for you. But I would like to warn anyone who uses this lotion if you have not used a tingle lotion, it is supposed to hurt! It feels roughly like a minor sunburn for 1-2hours after ward BUT if want to break through your tanning plateau or get the best color OF YOUR LIFE you have to use a tingler. Trust me when I say this. I have been tanning for years and until I tried a tingle I never got the color I get now and I only tan 1-3times a month. With this lotion you won&#x27;t even need to go more than that. Btw If this is your first tingle I recommend trying a packet of bombshell first, in conjunction with another lotion, that one burns way worse. If can handle that then your ready for the best tan you&#x27;ll ever have! Also the smell is delightful so if you like white gummy bears it might make the tingle effect worth it. Lol</li>
    <li> The tingle can get a bit intense, but it cools down after a while. It gets me very dark in just one session, as I already have a base tan, but had reached a plateau! Ruby is great to pass through that barrier and get super dark! Also, I have noticed I can wait longer between tanning sessions because my tan does not fade as fast.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a tingle lotion and I must say I am very impressed! I don&#x27;t feel any tingle while I&#x27;m in the tanning bed, but start turning red as soon as I get out. The heat only lasts about 20 minutes(when the cooling gems take effect) then my skin turns a beautiful brown. I&#x27;ve used it only twice and I can see a difference. Please be aware that you must have a good base tan going before using this lotion. If you&#x27;ve never tried a lotion like this before, try it on your arms or legs first before you apply it to your whole body so you wont freak out if it&#x27;s too much for you! Oh, and the smell of this lotion is intoxicating. Spicy/fruity, and I absolutely love it :)</li>
    <li> I had to edit this because I wasn&#x27;t specific enough about how this happened.  Didn&#x27;t think I needed to tell my whole life story to not be spoken to like I&#x27;m mentally challenged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work for a tanning salon here in NWI.  I get packets of new lotion to try all the time, and this one looked like something I&#x27;d like.  I use the hottest of tinglers all the time, and they don&#x27;t ever irriatate me.  Not like this one does!!!  I used a packet of this lotion one time, and I wish I had never used it.  It&#x27;s supposed to be a tingler with a COOLING AGENT in it.  I&#x27;ll tell you what, I use tingler on my face all the time, and not wiping my hands off before touching my face was the worst decision of my life.  My lip/chin burned soo bad, as well as the rest of my body for several hours.  There is absolutely nothing you can do to get it off, and because of the cooling agent if you try to rinse it off with water, it hurts about 1000000X worse!  OMG, do not ever use this near your face. You&#x27;re not supposed to use any tingler near your face, but seriously don&#x27;t get this one near it.  I can recommend some really good tinglers to anyone with great skin benefits in them.  I&#x27;m certified, and I go to lotion training classes twice a year to learn about new lotion and products.  They tell us not to put it on our face, but I usually do anyways, I chose not to put it on my face because I knew the cooling agent would feel like menthol..  I ended up rubbing the sweat off my face.  Since it was all over my hands, it got on my face!  I had to keep an ice pack over my face for about 4 hours after using RUBY.  I love Designer Skin products,  but this is the worst tingle I&#x27;ve used in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good hot tingler, the hottest I&#x27;ve ever been able to find is Designer Skin&#x27;s Modern Bombshell... and Swedish Beauty BoTANica&#x27;s: HOT GREEN TEASE!</li>
    <li> Ruby tingle is probably the hottest lotion ive used and believe me,ive used alot. It definately works. Im very impressed. I finally found a really good lotion. I recommend ruby over any tingle lotion. I love the color i get from it. Be careful not to rub your eyes it burns like crazy. its definately my favorite.</li>
    <li> This lotion is every thing it says it is.. the color boost is amazing. If you have a great base tan already, this will take you to that next level.</li>
    <li> HOLY CRAP!!! I under-estimated this lotion by a long shot! This is the most intense tingle I have ever tried!! It goes on easy and has a thin consistency and heats your body up FAST. Tanning bed felt 10X hotter with this lotion and definitely gave me the boost I needed to get a deep dark tan. Did not feel the cooling effect, however, but I do not mind. I will use this lotion all the time.</li>
    <li> I tan year around and designer skin is the best lotion out there. It really goes a long way and gives you a beautiful color,,, I have tried everything... Tha is great...</li>
    <li> The lotion does smell like pepto bismol but it will get you a great tan if you can stand the smell afterwards..LOL</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought a bottle with a bronzer and a tingle. I was scared after my first use because I turned really red for about an hour (it looks and feels like a sunburn, but goes away). For anyone buying this lotion, I would keep this in mind.  I would go tanning at the end of the day before going home so I wasn&#x27;t walking around looking like I had a severe sunburn. After going on a six month break from tanning, this lotion got me back to my normal dark color in only 3 visits to the salon, within one week.  I really enjoyed the smell of the lotion, how smoothly it went on, and I liked that it didn&#x27;t leave any streaks like some bronzers do.  But, I did NOT feel the cooling sensation, and like many lotions you kind of smell like a burnt tanning bed after using it. This is not ideal at all.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for this type of lotion with a tingle. With this lotion I was looking to get darker than when using other lotions, because I felt like I had hit a plateau. I have received the same results with other Designer Skin Bronzers like 14 Karat and Black. I will probably not buy this lotion again for that reason. Designer Skin has never disappointed me with any of the lotions I have bought though and I think this one will make most buyers happy.</li>
    <li> Did its job, not really my favorite lotion ever but it smells nice and is good for that extra boost</li>
    <li> This is an awesome tanning product. If you don&#x27;t like a tingle then this is not for you! I love a tingle! Get darker than you ever have. If you buy it you will be a repeat buyer!! Try it~~)</li>
    <li> Smells like that stripes zebra gum you would get as a child. It burns/tingles and feels almost like the affect &amp;#34;pre workout&amp;#34; has but a little more intense. You&#x27;ll see instant results!! It makes the blood rush to the skin so you&#x27;ll look like a lobster for about an hour or so. If you use a relief gel of any sort it will usually help soothe the tingle affect after you get out of the bed. You could also mix a tingle with a regular accelerator and it will lighten the tingle sensation. Not for first time tingle users. Once you use it you will never go back. Also don&#x27;t put this on your face. I feel like this should go without saying but just incase you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re doing as far as tanning don&#x27;t put any lotion on your face other than a lotion that is made specifically for your face or you will break out extremely bad, the tingle on such sensitive skin will be very painful as well.</li>
    <li> Hot &amp; great  love itttttttt!!!!</li>
    <li> Dang it&#x27;s hot!!!  I  wear my share of tingles, but it&#x27;s all I can do to wear this..lol.  I put on a thin layer of any other lotion, juicy or jwoww to tame the burn like on my neck and face.  I have yet to feel a cooling effect.  I still feel the tingle in sensitive spots hours later..which is crazy.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time and wow!  First let me say that it goes on better than any lotion I have previously used and this helps get the lotion applied evenly. I feel like I didn&#x27;t use as much because it went on so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used a tingle lotion before but I was not receiving the results I wanted with my regular bronzer so I bought some of this.  I thought &amp;#34;how hot can it be?&amp;#34;  The answer is that yes, it is hot but it&#x27;s also not as unbearable as everyone says.  It will make your skin feel like you are burning but it&#x27;s not unbearable.  When I got out of the bed I noticed that my skin was red but not like I thought that it would be.  More like I&#x27;d been working out, not tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my favorite thing about this is that as soon as I walked back into my office at work my boss took one look at me and said &amp;#34;wow, you look really tan.&amp;#34;  This is after a single use!!!!  I&#x27;ll will definitely be using this in place of my regular lotion because of the amazing results!</li>
    <li> I bought it because I was at a tan plateau, and it worked great the first time I used it. This product was the real deal. I was previously using the Designer Skin Luminary, which I do love and would still recommend, I prefer the before and after tanning smell of this and I enjoy the tingle. Fair warning though if you don&#x27;t have a descent tan or burn easily this is not a product for you! As one of my white friends found out in her words said it felt like the worst sunburn of her life and then she rubbed bengay on it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing and will be in my constant tanning lotion rotation. It makes you super dark and smells amazing as well. I would compare the smell to fruit gushers or fruity pebbles. There is no bad ato. It has a nice moisturizing feel and goes on smoothly. You&#x27;ll be red for an hour then you turn a nice dark brown like any other tingle lotion. The bottle I got here on Amazon was legit and worked correctly.</li>
    <li> I really like this tingle lotion. It works great on me. Yes I&#x27;m a little red afterward but it goes away in about a hour. For sure you need to have a base tan first. If you are not use to tingles start with something less intense</li>
    <li> Being an experienced tanner and this is by far the best tingle i have used.  With this product i reached a darker richer tan than i did with other tingles and bronzers.  This product also mixes well with the Kardashian Glow Iced Bronzer.  If you are not a big tingle user i do not suggest this product, but otherwise gives a great color as to where you do not have to tan but a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> I was VERY happy with my Ruby lotion, it&#x27;s gonna be hard for me to switch to something else. I was went back &amp; forth between Ruby &amp; Modern Bombshell I was very happy with my purchase. I buy tanning lotion at the salon all the time, this lotion was the same product at way better cost. Thanks again, I will be back to order more!! Ordered for the second time!! Great customer service too!!</li>
    <li> This is great.  I love the way it feels, really hot when you&#x27;re in the bed-the cooling factor starts about 40 minutes later.  I&#x27;ve tried this in several beds and works best in the 20 minute type.  Leaves a nice color behind, the redness isn&#x27;t so bad that I&#x27;m embarassed to make other stops after tanning.  The smell is great-the capsacion will make you cough when putting it on but after tanning you smell like fresh baked sugar cookies-that smell when you walk past the cookie place at the mall. Don&#x27;t touch your eyes or face for a while, don&#x27;t hug your kids, and don&#x27;t let your pets lick you till you&#x27;ve washed this off!  The heat transfers to others even if you don&#x27;t feel it anymore!  But due to the cosmetic bronzers probably wait 6 to 8 hours before bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this after the reviews. It does give great color and smells nice. However, I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the tingle factor. I didn&#x27;t feel any cooling either. Also, be warned... I was chewing on my finger nail after applying the lotion and it tasted like pepper was on my tongue. So make sure you wash your hands :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tanned 4-5 times a week for the last 2 years, so I&#x27;m already pretty dark. I&#x27;ve never believed in tanning lotions and never used one that did anything for me until I used this. After just one use, I looked 2 shades darker and it didn&#x27;t fade like other products i&#x27;ve tried. I also have been getting a ton of compliments lately about my tan and people think I&#x27;ve gone on vacation, so the color this lotion gives is not orange. This lotion is EXTREMELY hot, I personally enjoy tingles and find the warmth of the lotion comforting but I do not recommend this product to someone who burns easily or would not enjoy a lotion this hot. There is a cooling effect, but the heat definitley there. Because this lotion is such a high intesity tingler, RUB IT IN EVENLY..I&#x27;ve read a few reviews where people said this lotion made them cough and gag, I too have the same problem with this lotion but I&#x27;ve found that if I apply a little less that goes away. I do enjoy the scent of this lotion as well. If you enjoy tanning and have a base tan already I HIGHLY recommend RUBY. You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> Today was the first time I try this product. Ive been going to the tanning beds for about a month now and have been using Snooki&#x27;s dark tanning lotion, which gave me a nice base, but i was looking for a much deeper color. I have seen this product sit in the shelf at the tanning salon, and decided to do research on it, and wow!! was everything right. I was so scared to use it because of what i had read about the hotness (this is the first &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; lotion i use). It smells like fruit gushers. As i was putting it on, I could already feel the tingle. And I don&#x27;t know what it was, but the smell was making me cough like if it had pepper in it. When i finally got in the bed the only thing that was tingling were my arms and butt area. I did not put this product on my face, I was too scared. When I got out of the bed i was red, and i mean RED! and blotchy, I was scared. The lady at the tanning salon re-assured me that it was normal. she also said not to shower for 2 hours. That would make it worst. After an hour, I could feel the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; part. I kept getting goose bumps for no reason. And the final color, I was soooooo impressed!!! beautiful tan color, looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this products is excellent. If you are looking for color, this is the product. I would deff try it again. But you have been warned IT GETS HOT!!.</li>
    <li> Great. Just what it said it was.  Thank u. The real deal. Very satisfied. This bottle sells for 70 dollars at tanner.</li>
    <li> If you love tingle this is the lotion for you! The best I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> love, love, love the sizzle in this lotion...be sure to wash your hands well after putting lotion on...great smell to start with, but icky ato...doesn&#x27;t bother me though since I tan on my way home from work and don&#x27;t plan on getting back out for the evening</li>
    <li> BEST lotion ever! I only use this and goes to tanning bed for a month im so dark like i just got back from the beach. But this is the most HOT tingle lotion i ever use... its 10x hottest than Bombshell. Best to use it when u have basic tan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mega tan cost $120.00, bought off here is alot of cheaper!</li>
    <li> Smells fruity high sting</li>
    <li> This lotion is great if you actually get the right product. I&#x27;ve worked at tanning salons in the past and I know better not to buy online ever but I couldn&#x27;t afford this at the salon so I decided to give it a try. I had used a packet of  this lotion prior to buying the bottle so I knew what the smell was like etc.  When I received this it was extremely runny, it wasn&#x27;t the same color as the packet it was a lot lighter so it seemed like it had been diluted with something, and it didn&#x27;t work as well. I asked one of the tanning consultants if I could compare it to the bottle they had and I put them both on a white sheet of paper and they were two totally different lotions, everything about it except the smell was different.  Buying online and not from a store is basically like throwing your money in the trash can because that&#x27;s where this bottle went after I realized it wasn&#x27;t the correct product. It could have been expired, diluted, switched out with something different, sitting in a hot warehouse for a long period of time (which could be why it was so runny) etc. I know everybody thinks when the tanning consultants say don&#x27;t buy online they&#x27;re just trying to sell you a product, which is true but they are also trying to keep you from throwing your money away by taking a chance that you may or may not actually get the right product.</li>
    <li> Came quickly authentic product from what I can tell. Disappointed in the color it gave me. I love tingle always used them and this bottle sold for $100 at the salon so I figured it would be good. Tingle was strong on the first use since then I think my body became used to it still tingles but not strong. Does make you look like a lobster for hours afterwards lol. The smell is TERRIBLE afterwards. Was embarrassed stopping at the store on the way home. I&#x27;ve used Goddess and Bombshell and those are stronger and get better results and smell better then Ruby. I did notice results after first use but after the 4th use I noticed I was turning a orange color not a dark brown like I wanted. I mean really who wants to be orange ?? Lol I usually shower but decided to take a bath in the tub and when I got out the tub had a orangey tint to the water so obviously it washes off.  Glad I only paid $30 and not $100 !! Won&#x27;t use or buy again will stick with bombshell which gets me BROWN !!!</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m tanning obsessed, I buy a new lotion at least once a month. Luckily 90% of my girlfriends work at tanning salons. So I get all the help with deciding on the best lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatly I plateaued, all I usually user are bronzers until I get stuck, then I&#x27;ll move to tingles. So I was using Gilded (amazing bronzer) and realized I wasn&#x27;t seeing much color anymore. So I asked what is the best tingle? Every girl at the salon immediatly said Designer Skin&#x27;s Ruby. So I figured, why not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually cannot feel tingles. I&#x27;m not sure why (and I&#x27;m glad I can&#x27;t sometimes!). I&#x27;ve used Modern Bombshell and felt nothing, as well as Snooki&#x27;s Hot Bronzer, a slight burning sensation. But with this, its the perfect amount. Its really not painful at all, but it warms me up and gives me the BEST bronze color, with a hint of red. You will immediatly see color and you will be so happy! right after using this I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments of how tan I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with this lotion!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased a sample of this at my tanning salon and really liked it. However, they were selling it for $105. I was really happy to see it for less than half of that! I purchased from Fusion Hardware and my package came right on time (I chose one day shipping) and the bottle is definitely the authentic, real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I built up my base tan with Luminary and felt like I was plateauing with my tan. I knew a tingle would help me get the color I wanted. Before buying, I had also tried a sample of Modern Bombshell to see which one I liked best. I have used tingle lotions in the past and my favorite was the original Bombshell. I ended up chosing Ruby because I love the smell (like Starbursts!) and the cooling aspect. Modern Bombshell might be hotter than Ruby but I hated the rose scent and it made me really sweaty in the bed. I also love that Ruby is made with silicon so it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy after you tan, like the original Bombshell. Overall, Ruby does exactly what a tingle lotion is supposed to do. It will get you hot and give you a great color. The bronzers are really nice in this lotion. The scent is amazing and continues to smell good after you tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any tingle lotion, there are a few precautions you should take. Avoid sensitive areas. I never put tingle on my face, boobs or butt. Make sure you wipe your hands off with a towel after applying the lotion and before you get into the bed. Make sure you wash your hands really well after you get done tanning. And be really careful to avoid touching your face after using tingle, especially your eyes! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a starter tingle lotion but if you have used others before and know what to expect, go for it! I love Ruby!</li>
    <li> I was coughing when I applied this. It was like inhaling fumes. It was weird. A lot of people say they love it and don&#x27;t have the effects that I did. Weird but I cant use it.</li>
    <li> Love this product...smells great, fells great, and makes me dark!!! I recommend this product to anyone who has tanned for awhile.</li>
    <li> Hot! Hot! Hot! If you like hot this is it! Makes you look like a lobster when you get out the tanning bed but after some hours go by its a Nice brown color!</li>
    <li> No way possible someone can use this straight! It burns so badly!!! Most intense tingle lotion EVER! Definitely mix it with another lotion so you don&#x27;t want to rip your skin off!</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion. EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves me super dark and the tingle isn&#x27;t too extreme. I will def buy this again.</li>
    <li> just what i wanted! ordered it online because it was so much cheaper than at the store!!! very happy with results from lotion.</li>
    <li> Love it! I work at a tanning salon but it&#x27;s still expensive for me there. This is the real deal! Definitely hot if you&#x27;re not an experienced tanner with tingle lotions.</li>
    <li> My go to tingle for routine tanning.. I switch it up with love hurts , but for the most part this is my favorite tingle these days...</li>
    <li> very very good!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE: Capsaicin is an irritant (made from Chili peppers) and produces a burning (or tingling for some) sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have skin sensitivity or an know you have an allergy to it; this will be an EXTREMELY uncomfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;I was not aware of the ingredient in this bottle prior to use; and after doing so; applying liberally -&lt;br /&gt;I broke out in what was nearly the worst 8 hours following.&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty much in tears from the allergic reaction that followed. My entire body broke out in red splotches and felt as though I had a full blown fever and even had crazy chills from it. I attempted to take a shower to rinse off the lotion and felt as though it only made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t have known it was from the lotion itself, I probably would&#x27;ve taken a trip to the emergency room.&lt;br /&gt;It was probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had with a tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with skin sensitivity at all.&lt;br /&gt;I do tan quite frequently (3-4 times a week) and I usually use Black Noir or Obsidian products; and I have never come across a product that has given me a reaction like this Ruby product has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tread Carefully with this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion is simply amazing! It literally only took about 3 tanning sessions to get me dark as if I&#x27;ve been tanning regularly for months. I must say, very IMPRESSIVE! At first, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell ... you can definately smell the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; in this lotion, in which I&#x27;ve never been too fond of. The tingle action is pretty intense also, but I am experienced with tingles and you do get used to it after a few times of use. I&#x27;ve tried close to 100 different lotions, ranging in different brands and this places in my TOP 5 so far. Thanks Designer Skin, another winner!</li>
    <li> This is stuff is tuff..... It works !!! I put it on and it starts the tingling procress - Fast Action !!! My skin is Red before making it into the tan bed.  But Note: I Dont feel the cooling senation in the product</li>
    <li> Arrived within 2 days of me purchasing it. The packaging was nice and clean. The bottle itself was perfect as well!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I love the tingle, made me really feel like I was getting a great tan for some reason. But once I got out of the bed I could already see the results. I love the way it helped me achieve the next level on my tan. I have tanned many years, tried many products but I can safely say this has been my best. Tingle is not for everyone! But those who like it will love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Worship and Goddess over the years but my favorite has always been the original Bombshell 100 xx. Bombshell is a cake walk compared to this stuff! Seriously. I use Bombshell on my face and neck now because I can&#x27;t get this Ruby stuff near my mouth or eyes. The burn takes longer to kick in than other tingles I&#x27;ve used but it takes my breath away. Literally. I think it has pepper in it or some ingredient with similar effect on my breathing? I have some food allergies and this lotion ignites symptoms. I paid $95 at the salon for it though- so I&#x27;m using it anyway!  Lol. It reminds me of the burn I experienced long ago with old school Swedish beauty products and serums. It does have a self tan bronzer in it so it is slightly tan in color and makes you smell funny even after showers. I personally am of native American lineage and I normally tan very red/brown- so I appreciate the bronzer lotions- they tame some of the red tone by adding yellow.  I just wish they didn&#x27;t leave that funny smell.</li>
    <li> This smells so good. I own a tanning salon and the lady that bought this absolutely loves it. It tingles and it smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I have tried several tingle lotions, and this is my favorite.  I am definitely hot &amp; red after tanning, but nothing I can&#x27;t handle.  Just don&#x27;t get it anywhere near your butt... &#x3D;)  It is moisturizing &amp; feels good on my skin.  If you have reached a plateau, this should help you break through.</li>
    <li> I am giving this a 3. Reason being .... Yes you get tingle but you get used to it very easily.  The scent is kinda gross. Especially after you get finished tanning. You have to rub in really good so you don&#x27;t get any streaking in between your fingers. The color is good but unless you tan every day it will fade. The main reason I will not get this again is the over powering fumes. When I put this on my upper body near the shoulders and chest the fumes literally choke me and make me cough. I prefer Goddess and will be going back to that.</li>
    <li> My Fiancee works at a tanning salon. This is an amazing price, she ended up telling several of her friends about this price!</li>
    <li> Love it! Gives me a better color than the original bomb shell</li>
    <li> Does not give me a good tan like the ROAR does. In fact the only thing it DOES do is make my skin hot, I could just as well pour hot sauce on my skin for all the good Ruby does.</li>
    <li> LOVE this tingle, 1/3 the price as they are selling it at my salon!!</li>
    <li> When I saw that my tanning salon had this lotion for over 150$ I knew there was no way I was spending that. So I found it on amazon and bought it. I would say from using the trial packets you could almost feel it burning before you even got into the bed, that actual bottom of lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to be as bad, it&#x27;s a very good lotion, I got dark quick, and didn&#x27;t turn orange. I would highly recommend this lotion to anyone who likes tingle lotions. One of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried. I can say with this lotion I start red a lot longer than the other ones I&#x27;ve used then after hours of being red eventually it turns dark.</li>
    <li> Not bad, did give a tingle but not that intense.  Absorbs well with nice scent. Another lotion, Trinity is much better.</li>
    <li> Oh my this is by far the BEST tingle lotion I have ever used. Just to let you know it&#x27;s a very strong tingle, so I recommend for experience tanners. It also gives a wonderful color. Just LOVE IT!!! Looking for a HOT tingle with a great bronzer, you will love Ruby!!!</li>
    <li> works very well and smells good too. i like the sensation of the tingle plus the cooling! very dark and only need to tan once or twice a week with this product. very nice!</li>
    <li> I like this it is good</li>
    <li> I liked the lotion, smells ok, feels smooth, only thing is I bought it for the tingle and the cooling and never felt the cooling, bought from theetanman</li>
    <li> OUCH!!!! I have to cut this with other lotions and it still feels like there is something ripping my skin off.  I used this with a really strong base tan too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning on and off for about 10 years now, and this is prob one of the best lotions I have used. It definitely gives you an amazing color! Just to note - as with any tingle/sizzle lotion, you have to be careful around kids and pets after use with indoor tanning.</li>
    <li> First, this is the legitimate product. I bought a packet from my salon so I&#x27;d used it before. No worries about receiving illegitimate product.&lt;br /&gt;I did standard 3-5 day shipping. Ordered it Sunday and got it the same week. This is pretty standard with most other online shopping I do. It was packaged appropriately and my items were in pristine condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Have you ever eaten gushers? That&#x27;s what this smells like. It just smells so deliciously fruity and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Texture: The texture of this lotion is not overly thick and is made with silicone so it goes on like a dream. My skin feels so incredibly soft after using this.&lt;br /&gt;Heat/cooling: This tingle definitely gets hot and your skin gets pretty red (ruby red, if you will ;D) The heat lingers with me for about an hour. the cooling is kind of different. I didn&#x27;t feel like the lotion was cooling my skin, but rather it felt like I had just eaten some ice cream and my internal body was cold. I know this sounds weird, but you just have to experience this lotion to understand what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;Bronzing: Because of the tingling/bronzing, this is really a super lotion. I got super dark after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely happy that I was able to purchase this lotion at a much cheaper price through this seller. I was mostly worried that the lotions I&#x27;d be purchasing wouldn&#x27;t be legit, but I&#x27;m happy to vouch that these lotions are the real thing.</li>
    <li> I had read so many favorable reviews I thought I had finally found a winner.  Ruby did not meet my expectations, was hoping it would really fire me up.  I also did not notice the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; experience it said it would have.  I let a friend use it and she loved it.  When I use a tingle, I want to feel it...not so much.  It does have a pleasant smell.  I plan to continue to use Ruby but interchange it with another product as I tan.</li>
</ol>
