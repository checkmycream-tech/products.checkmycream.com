    <li> Loved price and that it gets here fast.Also is great for hair that is hard to keep strait and in place</li>
    <li> This helps smooth out my very thick, wavy, coarse hair when I want to go straight. I didn&#x27;t feel the stickiness that others mentioned, I think the key to not having the stickiness is to do as the directions state and spray a section first, then flat iron it right away. This  also gave my hair a really nice shine! Going to buy another can so I don&#x27;t run out!!</li>
    <li> I used to use this a few years ago and it left my hair super straight and beautiful! However, I bought this recently and it seems to have a different affect on my hair. The product seems to be a bit weaker. However it still helps straighten my hair when I use the flat iron. I have oily hair and this product will dry your hair out. I would suggest after you use the spray and flat iron to apply some glossing or shine serum.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this and I used to buy it from her. Purchasing online, however, gives me the benefit of bulk. Regardless of convenience in buying, it&#x27;s just a really good product for thin, fine hair. A quick spritz at the base of a section of hair before using the flatiron gives volume and styling control without it becoming gummy or too heavy.</li>
    <li> Love it. Have used it since hair dresser recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, use it all the time!</li>
    <li> This is hairspray - not flat iron spray!  It&#x27;s thick and sticky.  Would not purchase again!</li>

    <li> Although not cheap, this is an excellent product. Holds your hair and also lets you style it after spraying. Excellent buy from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to cut humidity out in the summer. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling stiff like a lot of flat iron products.</li>
    <li> I found this product because a hair dresser used it at a wedding to CURL my hair. I began using it for curling and straightening and all is good. You should buy. It&#x27;s healthy and keeps the look lasting all night</li>
    <li> Good hair protection from hot flat irons. Keeps hair looking shiny and minimizes split ends. We have purchased Soya several times and are very happy with it.</li>

    <li> I love this product.  I have for years.  We have now moved to a small town so it needs to be ordered online, but totally worth it.</li>

    <li> I cannot be without this product.  It makes my hair silky while protecting it from the heat from my hairdryer and flat iron.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I flat iron my wavy hair, but was having trouble getting it super straight and silky, plus the slightest bit of humidity would poof it up again.  This stuff solved all of that and my hair stays straight and silky all day and even when I wake up the next day.  It also has a very nice fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My hair is naturally pretty limp and won&#x27;t hold a curl, this stuff is amazing for giving me some volume and keeping my style in DC humidity. Pro-tip: do not brush your hair after putting it in, treat this almost like a hairspray.</li>
    <li> This works to help keep my hair straight when using a flat iron. However, it doesn&#x27;t work well in humid weather.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom it is the only spay she now uses. Love it and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the way it left my hair, it was very sticky and couldn&#x27;t do much with it after i used this product</li>
    <li> it was a great price. It arrived on time and was in great condition. I was very pleased with product</li>
    <li> This stuff is gross and stinks.  Leaves a sticky and STINKY residue in your hair. Not the type of product I expect from this brand.  This was my first time trying this product but it won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
    <li> Great heat protection</li>
    <li> my favorite straightening product</li>
    <li> I have hair that is just below my shoulders and is think but very fine. It&#x27;s also very wavy in the back. This is the only spray that I have found that helps me to straighten my hair without feeling like I have product on it. I love this stuff! Works great.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, does not leave the hair sticky and does what it says it does. This is one I shall buy again.</li>
