      <li>The best way I know to describe</li>
      <li>let alone removing your make up -- but it does, wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it to wipe toothpaste off my kid&#x27;s shirt, it is awesome!</li>
      <li>This cloth was great and worked just as others noted...</li>
      <li>Great for washing your face.</li>
      <li>This is great for cleansing my face.</li>
      <li>Even so, if used too often it might not be too good for the skin.</li>
      <li>Good quality cloth.</li>
      <li>The good</li>
      <li>I LOVE this cloth!  </li>
      <li>Nice case for traveling..</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice plastic envelope which makes traveling with this a breeze.  </li>
      <li>the sponge cloth is perfect for removing your eye makeup in a gentle effective way.  </li>
      <li>I own two of them.</li>
      <li>If it didn&#x27;t fall apart I would have really liked this product.</li>
      <li>Soft and wonderful.  </li>
      <li>washes easily but don&#x27;t put in dryer!</li>
      <li>I love, love, love these Dermalogica sponge cloths!</li>
      <li>This towel works great and is very gentle.</li>
      <li>It is very smooth on your face.  </li>
      <li>I love this sponge.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.  </li>
      <li>Something like this, I suppose, should be a bag into which wash cloth may be inserted for more feel of pressure, even if it is just a feeling.</li>
      <li>I love this fabric/material for my face.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I love the dermalogica sponge cloth for taking off my makeup and cleansing my face.</li>
      <li>Much better than a wash cloth.</li>
      <li>and I purchase, after a while they where not carrying it any more.</li>
      <li>Love it..  </li>
      <li>good Konjac sponge can be just a gentle, and it exfoliates slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Easy to purchase thru Amazon.</li>
      <li>can throw this in the washer, and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too &#x27;Smooth&#x27;</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but this cloth really is THE best at facial cleansing.</li>
      <li>I was very excited and ordered it right away.</li>
      <li>It feels like a whole lot of nothing when you&#x27;re using it, but somehow (Voodoo?), this little guy manages to be the best thing my now glowing, baby soft skin has ever had the joy of not-really-feeling.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also fantastic at removing makeup without any soap or makeup remover - somehow these cloths take my makeup right off, even waterproof mascara!</li>
      <li>And it rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>I would say that this cloth is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; and the relatively modest price, compared to many of the products, is a bargain!</li>
      <li>And GOOD different.</li>
      <li>I have used the real cloth and love it.</li>
      <li>I was just using it as a wash cloth for the gym and after one quick wash and hang-dry it began losing chunks of material.</li>
      <li>This is better than any wash cloth, been using for over 3 months and its great for my delicate skin</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and use it several times a day for this purpose.</li>
      <li>I used it a lot for my face at night and morning, lives your face so nice and soft that it is hard to describe how great it feels.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>But Im sure its a copy of the real Dermalogica sponge cloth, so Im very dissapointed with Amazon selling FAKES . .</li>
      <li>It is so soft and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>My skin was so soft, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
      <li>Convinced I was imagining it, I immediately reached for a magnification mirror, and nope, all of the patches of peeling, flaking skin that I normally find in great abundance after washing my face (I have extraordiNARILY dry skin) were nowhere to be found.</li>
      <li>But the kicker is when my first cloth became worn out...</li>
      <li>Finally, the cloth I received was heavier and more turgid/less collapsable than the official one.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this, I stood in my shower, rubbing furiously at my face, trying to produce something similar to the, for lack of a better word, harsher feel I was used to getting when cleansing with a wash cloth or a Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Maybe that is why I see so much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on my cloth ;-)</li>
      <li>I was amazed the first time I used this cloth just how much came off my face.</li>
      <li>I also use Dermalogica precleanse prior to using my (non-Dermalogica) facial cleanse and LOVE that too!  </li>
      <li>Nothing else seems to exfoliate my skin and remove my makeup so thoroughly and yet gently.</li>
      <li>This really didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>really like how well this cleans my face.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
      <li>So what I do when it is really worn out I order another one.</li>
      <li>It holds up on the gentle cycle in the washing machine too.  </li>
      <li>to do any real cleansing.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They dry super fast, and (I believe) are therefore a lot more sanitary to reuse than a regular washcloth, which sits and grows bacteria while it dries.</li>
      <li>It actually does feel gentle on my face and gets my skin clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a very flat, smooth, piece of latex/</li>
      <li>The makeup rinses off and leaves it clean for the next time you want to use it.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll never use a normal wash cloth again.  </li>
      <li>: most of the makeup came off onto the cloth where you can actually see her &amp;#34;face&amp;#34;, the water wrings out almost completely where it&#x27;s practically dry after each wringing, no musty odor.</li>
      <li>It was the exact the same cloth I remembered.</li>
      <li>I use both powder and other exfoliates and it works well with them all and still rinses clean.  </li>
      <li>What a previous reviewer said about the cloth \\&quot;gliding\\&quot; across the skin is quite accurate.</li>
      <li>This product is soft and dries quickly as described in the other reviews; however, it began ripping into pieces after just two weeks.</li>
      <li>I used this face cloth early 1980&#x27;s when I was still in Japan.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin around my eye area.  </li>
      <li>Looking at the unopened package, the only noticeable difference between the item I received and the official product is that &amp;#34;Dermalogica&amp;#34; is printed in much darker ink on the item I received.</li>
      <li>The use: my young daughter to remove dance makeup.</li>
      <li>Soft when soaked.  </li>
      <li>However, when my old cloth wore out and I replaced it with a Dermalogica The Sponge Cloth purchased from Amazon, something felt a bit off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so incredibly soft</li>
      <li>It is so soft and not harsh as if washing with a face cloth.</li>
      <li>Be careful not to keep it in the pouch for any longer than necessary bc moisture can build up creating \\&quot;mildewy\\&quot; spots (you have to fold when damp and the spots do come clean).</li>
      <li>It is the only thing I use and it still looks brand new!</li>
      <li>That said, it did manage to exfoliate to some degree--evidenced by the little rolls of dead skin that sometimes come off when rubbing my wet face with the cloth--albeit with a bit more skin tugging than occurs with the real deal.</li>
      <li>Much gentler than the other fibre based cloths which i have too.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to hang it to air dry and don&#x27;t freak out with how hard it becomes when dry.  </li>
      <li>got this as a gift for my sister… she lives in a dry climate and has sensitive skin.</li>

<li> A few seconds in water makes it soft as a whisper once again.  </li>
<li> The only thing that&#x27;s a little weird about them is they dry hard (into whatever shape you left them in), but just wet it with hot water and it softens right back up again.</li>
<li> By the time I was toweling off, I had already mentally formulated most of the scathing review I planned to leave on this product as soon as I got the chance.</li>
<li> I wash with my towels and hang dry.  </li>
<li> After each use hang to dry.  </li>
<li> you get this Sponge cloth under water it gets soft, when it gets dry it get hard.</li>
<li> it is, it feels like you&#x27;re rubbing a wet balloon across your face.</li>
<li> experience with the Dermalogica Sponge Cloth is not at all what I expected.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works well, BUT, I have some black spots on the cloth and do not know where they came from?  Anyone have any ideas?</li>
    <li> It is very smooth on your face.  Love it..  Have used them for years.  Nice case for traveling..Easy to purchase thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge.  It wipes off excess makeup and gets off the mascara that makeup remover just can&#x27;t get at.  It rinses and dries well.  It holds up on the gentle cycle in the washing machine too.  I own two of them.</li>
    <li> This cloth was great and worked just as others noted...for only the first few times! The use: my young daughter to remove dance makeup. The good: most of the makeup came off onto the cloth where you can actually see her &amp;#34;face&amp;#34;, the water wrings out almost completely where it&#x27;s practically dry after each wringing, no musty odor. The bad...very bad: the makeup does not wash out completely in the washer and got dingy and looked disgusting after only 2-3 uses/washes, it dries hard like a chamois and does not rehydrate easily where the water slides off the cloth under a running faucet for awhile before it soaks in the water again. Overall, this was a horrible choice. I&#x27;m unsure how this receives any rave reviews.</li>
    <li> the sponge cloth is perfect for removing your eye makeup in a gentle effective way.  But the kicker is when my first cloth became worn out...I picked it up and used it to remove a smudge of deodorant from my shirt...I&#x27;ve used it to wipe toothpaste off my kid&#x27;s shirt, it is awesome!</li>
    <li> really like how well this cleans my face.  it did show up a bit damp though, hence the downgrade to 4 stars. washes easily but don&#x27;t put in dryer!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cloth!  I bought it at a local beauty store on sale just to try it.  I will never use a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; wash cloth again.  I was amazed the first time I used this cloth just how much came off my face. Sounds gross, but I never saw it with a regular wash cloth.  It comes in a nice plastic envelope which makes traveling with this a breeze.  Be careful not to keep it in the pouch for any longer than necessary bc moisture can build up creating \\&quot;mildewy\\&quot; spots (you have to fold when damp and the spots do come clean). After each use hang to dry.  This thing dries hard, feeling like cardboard.  But once under water it melts into your hands still keeping its softness.  I wash with my towels and hang dry.  I have had this cloth for a few months now. It is the only thing I use and it still looks brand new! I am adding another to my Christmas list.  Buy it! It&#x27;s worth the money. I also use Dermalogica precleanse prior to using my (non-Dermalogica) facial cleanse and LOVE that too!  Maybe that is why I see so much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on my cloth ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few cleansing cloths...I like the Wonder cloth, though it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;rinse out\\&quot; as well as the reviews reported.  This cloth does.  It&#x27;s so incredibly soft -- you can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s even doing anything...let alone removing your make up -- but it does, wonderfully.  And it rinses clean.  Be sure to hang it to air dry and don&#x27;t freak out with how hard it becomes when dry.  A few seconds in water makes it soft as a whisper once again.  I&#x27;m ordering more.  I can&#x27;t say how long it&#x27;ll last, but I&#x27;m wiling to take a chance.  I&#x27;m recommending it to all my friends.  I use both powder and other exfoliates and it works well with them all and still rinses clean.  You&#x27;ll never use a normal wash cloth again.  I hope they never stop making these!</li>
    <li> I have used the real cloth and love it. Nothing else seems to exfoliate my skin and remove my makeup so thoroughly and yet gently. It also simplifies the whole face-washing routine, while (if used with a bar soap) requiring less water than other methods (such as cleanser+toner, cleansing oil, facial sponge cleansing) to get everything off your face.  However, when my old cloth wore out and I replaced it with a Dermalogica The Sponge Cloth purchased from Amazon, something felt a bit off. And after having now compared it side-by-side to the real thing purchased from the Dermalogica website, I can see that what I received appears to be a fake. Looking at the unopened package, the only noticeable difference between the item I received and the official product is that &amp;#34;Dermalogica&amp;#34; is printed in much darker ink on the item I received. Upon opening the package, I was presented with a super-industrial smell not encountered with the official product. Finally, the cloth I received was heavier and more turgid/less collapsable than the official one. That said, it did manage to exfoliate to some degree--evidenced by the little rolls of dead skin that sometimes come off when rubbing my wet face with the cloth--albeit with a bit more skin tugging than occurs with the real deal.</li>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I used it with my regular cleanser, and I felt like it didn&#x27;t Exfoliate at all.  It&#x27;s like a very flat, smooth, piece of latex/sponge.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too &#x27;Smooth&#x27; to do any real cleansing.  It is gentle, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good Konjac sponge can be just a gentle, and it exfoliates slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ending up tossing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer my Konjac Sponge to this any day.</li>
    <li> This product is soft and dries quickly as described in the other reviews; however, it began ripping into pieces after just two weeks. I was just using it as a wash cloth for the gym and after one quick wash and hang-dry it began losing chunks of material. If it didn&#x27;t fall apart I would have really liked this product.</li>
    <li> Multi-purpose cloth designed to assist in your facial cleaning routine when using Dermalogica products. I am very pleased with my purchase and use it several times a day for this purpose. I would say that this cloth is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; and the relatively modest price, compared to many of the products, is a bargain! The cleansing products seem to go further as a result of using it.</li>
    <li> This is great for cleansing my face. When wet it has a soft, almost rubbery feel. It actually does feel gentle on my face and gets my skin clean. After the cloth dries, it is as hard as cardboard, but when wet it softens up again.</li>
    <li> I have purchase this cloth some years ago in one of the beauty shops that used to go and get my hair done in Vegas, they had this product and I purchase, after a while they where not carrying it any more. So I look in Amazon for it and I found it. I used it a lot for my face at night and morning, lives your face so nice and soft that it is hard to describe how great it feels.&lt;br /&gt;When you get this Sponge cloth under water it gets soft, when it gets dry it get hard. So sometimes it gets brittle so it seems to make holds on it. So what I do when it is really worn out I order another one.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years, decided to buy on amazon . . But Im sure its a copy of the real Dermalogica sponge cloth, so Im very dissapointed with Amazon selling FAKES . . Please prove me wrong and I will take this down . . But its not the same . . SAD brought two</li>
    <li> I have been using these for 20 years. Great for washing your face. I hope they never stop making them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. I love this fabric/material for my face.&lt;br /&gt;You can throw this in the washer, and it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Good quality cloth. Much gentler than the other fibre based cloths which i have too.  Even so, if used too often it might not be too good for the skin. After using for a month everyday, I find my fingers are starting to get numb.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin around my eye area.  Removing eye makeup is always difficult for me.  This towel works great and is very gentle.</li>
    <li> Soft when soaked.  Stopped using because it feels little slimy and does not leave the skin a bit tingling?  Something like this, I suppose, should be a bag into which wash cloth may be inserted for more feel of pressure, even if it is just a feeling.</li>
    <li> At first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the Dermalogica Sponge Cloth is not at all what I expected. What a previous reviewer said about the cloth \\&quot;gliding\\&quot; across the skin is quite accurate. The best way I know to describe it is, it feels like you&#x27;re rubbing a wet balloon across your face. Seriously. There&#x27;s (seemingly) NO traction. The first time I used this, I stood in my shower, rubbing furiously at my face, trying to produce something similar to the, for lack of a better word, harsher feel I was used to getting when cleansing with a wash cloth or a Clarisonic. I became increasingly frustrated, convinced that this couldn&#x27;t possibly be doing anything at all for my skin and was, as a result, among the most useless purchases I&#x27;d ever made ($18 for a wet balloon?!). By the time I was toweling off, I had already mentally formulated most of the scathing review I planned to leave on this product as soon as I got the chance. Those other reviewers LIED to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then it came time for my after-shower facial routine. As soon as my fingers touched my face, I could tell something was different. And GOOD different. My skin was so soft, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it. Convinced I was imagining it, I immediately reached for a magnification mirror, and nope, all of the patches of peeling, flaking skin that I normally find in great abundance after washing my face (I have extraordiNARILY dry skin) were nowhere to be found. Gone! And with them were my feelings of hostility toward this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but this cloth really is THE best at facial cleansing. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll see what I mean. It feels like a whole lot of nothing when you&#x27;re using it, but somehow (Voodoo?), this little guy manages to be the best thing my now glowing, baby soft skin has ever had the joy of not-really-feeling.</li>
    <li> I love the dermalogica sponge cloth for taking off my makeup and cleansing my face. It is so soft and not harsh as if washing with a face cloth. As it dries it gets hard but softens when you put it under water. You just get it wet and wring it out and it&#x27;s ready to use. The makeup rinses off and leaves it clean for the next time you want to use it. It&#x27;s revolutionary!</li>
    <li> I do not like this at all.  I read endless reviews about all of the makeup remover cloths and bought a few...  this was the worst one and I am not going to be using it anymore after 4 times.</li>
    <li> This is better than any wash cloth, been using for over 3 months and its great for my delicate skin</li>
    <li> I used this face cloth early 1980&#x27;s when I was still in Japan. When I moved here in 1982, I have been looking for this face cloth till recently I found it at Amazon. I was very excited and ordered it right away. It was the exact the same cloth I remembered. It cleans your face without damaging tissue. It is so soft and easy to clean. I love this product.</li>
    <li> got this as a gift for my sister… she lives in a dry climate and has sensitive skin. she thought it was weird at first but seems to really like using it to remove makeup.</li>
    <li> Much better than a wash cloth. It is less messy.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love these Dermalogica sponge cloths! They dry super fast, and (I believe) are therefore a lot more sanitary to reuse than a regular washcloth, which sits and grows bacteria while it dries. They&#x27;re also fantastic at removing makeup without any soap or makeup remover - somehow these cloths take my makeup right off, even waterproof mascara! The only thing that&#x27;s a little weird about them is they dry hard (into whatever shape you left them in), but just wet it with hot water and it softens right back up again.</li>
    <li> This cloth always lives up to my expectations, removes all make up thoroughly, beats wash cloth every time.</li>
    <li> Soft and wonderful.  I recommend over a wash cloth.</li>
