<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> WOW is all I can say! I have NEVER written a review for a product I&#x27;ve liked but this is product is so life changing for me I just have to share! I have struggled with dry cracked heels since I can remembered and have tried every product out there and none made too much of a difference. I was so determined to have my dry cracked heels not embarrass me that I had begun to wear plastic bags on my feet during the day around the house with the latest \\&quot;wonder cream\\&quot; but it didn&#x27;t do much. Then I got a pedicure and the lady doing my nails told me one of her clients had dry cracked heels worse than mine but she got some cream \\&quot;like shaving cream\\&quot; and now her feet are better. That was all I had to go on so I did some research and figured this product was it - and boy was it ever! After 1 week of using it 2x a day my feet are almost as soft as my 8 year old sons!! I told my husband to look at my feet and he said \\&quot;Wow, your feet have never looked so good, as long as I&#x27;ve know you your feet have been crusty.\\&quot; This stuff is such a miracle and I want to stop people in the street and tell them. I can&#x27;t stop touching my feet they have never been this soft except for 1 day after a pedicure. Buy this product if you suffer from dry cracked heels it will change your life!</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with my heels forever and have spent hundreds of dollars on products.  This is the best I have ever used. My heels feel and look so much better. I will not be without this product!!</li>
    <li> I purchased Footlogix #3 Cracked Heel Formula  when I thought nothing would help my perpetually cracked heels.  Cleared up the problem completely in less than 10 days!</li>
    <li> This  product really works wonderfully. Cracks on the heels disapear. No more snagging of pantyhose when putting them on. I wish i had a travel size to take on trips. Just can&#x27;t beleive how a little foam makes such a differnce.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my feet for a while.  My cracked heels have really improved.  You do have to use it everyday to see results.</li>
    <li> I really love the Footlogix products.  They are amazing!  One of my biggest fears is to end up with dry feet with thick yellow toenails like I see so often.  Luckily, I&#x27;m far from it.  Keeping my feet nice is on the top of my list and the last thing I want to do is have cracked heels and callouses.  During the summer, it&#x27;s easy for feet to get dry, but Footlogix takes away the dryness instantly.  It comes out in foam form and easily spreads on your feet.  This is the first time I tried the Extra Cracked Heel formula, I usually just use the anti-fungal formula and that even does the trick.  It takes away the itchiness when skin gets dry.  I would recommend these products to anyone.  I used to get it at the beauty supply, but they stopped carrying it.  I&#x27;m just glad I could find it online.  WELL WORTH THE MONEY!  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the small package, it lasts a good long time because it doesn&#x27;t require much to get the job done.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Cracked heels are a thing of the past when this product is used on a regular basis! Great all year round if your feet are dry and cracked. Feet become soft and smooth after the use of this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have had foot and hand issues for years. This is the only product that works for me on both</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; product for foot dryness due to peripheral neuropathy.  Use it one to two times a day.</li>
    <li> Followed the instructions - twice daily.  Didn&#x27;t work for me even with 2 pedicures.  It may work for you.  It came highly recommended at About Faces.  They use the product for their pedicures.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this item and really wanted it to work great.....but after using it daily for a month, my heels are still cracked.  Sadly, this product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> It leaves a sticky residue.</li>
    <li> I was shocked with the results after 2 weeks of use.  I have tried dozens of products in the past however this one has by far provided the best results.  My feet look fantastic and I would absolutely recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great just need to remember to use it daily. It is very easy to use, will buy more!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this product before I decided to try it.  It&#x27;s working very well, and I am so pleased!</li>
    <li> Product works as expected.  A little goes a long way and is not greasy.  Works great on my mildly cracked heels.</li>
    <li> A good friend, that has sever dry heels recommended to me.  I like that is not oily and it gets absorved right away.  My feet are happy</li>
    <li> Great stuff works well as long as used as directed.  My feet feel great and are soft and smooth again.</li>
    <li> I found this product ineffective and it did not live up to its claim. I used it for 2 weeks and then had a pedicure. I always use Footlogic Callus Softener - I bring it with me to the salon where I get pedicures. I found no difference using the cracked heel formula. It was a waste money.</li>
    <li> I have been using Foot logic for 6 years now. My ped girl would use it then it was not available in U.S. anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I was blessed with my mothers dry feet. Sometimes the cracks are so bad that I cannot walk on them.&lt;br /&gt;This is a Mousse and you do NOT need to use a lot of the product. This bottle will last you a very long time. Fight the feeling that you need to use more than a shot glass full. It will not feel greasy or like a cream. You think it needs to feel thick and layered as you would with cream. You don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;Here is my routine and it works even if I don&#x27;t use it everyday. No need.&lt;br /&gt;After getting out of the shower or tub when your feet are softest, put a dollop on each foot and put on socks or slippers or your shoes. I have literally put it on then a pair of sandals. It doesn&#x27;t make you slip and slide.&lt;br /&gt;*It is best to do this also at night before bed with a little sock.&lt;br /&gt;This has honestly heeled a severe crack in 24 hours for me. I had to be diligent in reapplying more often than I would for just keeping them soft.&lt;br /&gt;Also, If you put it on and have time to wait about a 1/2 hour, then can use a foot file or Ped-Egg, you will do it with ease.&lt;br /&gt;This is a synthetic urine. I know it sounds gross. Its really not.&lt;br /&gt;Wash your hands after.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Soft feet are ahead for you too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for year.  Leaves heels so soft and cracks disappear.  My salon also uses this product .</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but it works well in winter when air is dry and easy to apl\ply and good for your hands.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for one week.  So far it works.  I have problems with the bottom of my feet.  This goes on great and has no fragrance (allergic).  Seems to be working.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with cracked and dry heels. This product is excellent. I only use it periodically and the cracks on one foot are completely healed. The other foot is getting there. No dry itchy feeling. And the product is non-greasy.use it everyday. It Another perfect product. I just love it. The product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
