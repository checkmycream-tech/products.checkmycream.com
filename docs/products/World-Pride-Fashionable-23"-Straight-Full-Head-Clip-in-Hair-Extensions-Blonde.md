      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
      <li>customer service is great..</li>
      <li>but I successfully cut it and it looks great.</li>
      <li>so of course they won&#x27;t be as good as $300+</li>
      <li>My daughters friend loved the extensions.</li>
      <li>The outcome was phenomenal!  </li>
      <li>These things are fantastic, and, great.  </li>
      <li>I liked this product.</li>
      <li>This was so fun, easy, and, made her so happy!</li>
      <li>The clips seems good, strong quality.</li>
      <li>but it wears great and is fun</li>
      <li>quality is okay</li>
      <li>But I am still able to use it with my hair.</li>
      <li>All n all i love it</li>
      <li>Need more than one for it to blend into your hair.</li>
      <li>But they do their job, but look into the shipping details and make sure you don&#x27;t buy one that takes months to ship.</li>
      <li>It blended pretty good with my hair</li>
      <li>The hair was long tho just was perfect for me since I have hip length hair.</li>
      <li>The picture accurately shows the strawberry blonde color that it is which is perfect for my hair.</li>
      <li>Great shipping and extensions are really soft!</li>
      <li>I was so excited at first to see this product it was nicely packaged and it looks nice.</li>
      <li>The 2nd one I bought also was incredibly tangled.</li>
      <li>I paid $7.99 and free shipping, plus the extensions blend with my darker lowlights.</li>
      <li>in the description it stated that I would be able to use hot tools to style the hair.</li>
      <li>The hair seems to be good quality but the actual hair was waaaay off color than what&#x27;s shown.</li>
      <li>We can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  </li>
      <li>it says full head hair extensions</li>
      <li>this clip is really nice, my hair is naturally frizzy and volumed/wavy.</li>
      <li>If you have short hair, like myself, this is obviously a good purchase.</li>
      <li>for synthetic hair its not bad.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>i began reading reviews and  quickly thought i made a mistake.</li>
      <li>but I ran some super glue along the rim like another review that I saw it worked out pretty well.</li>
      <li>i guess it came pretty quick.</li>
      <li>other than that it looks good</li>
      <li>And if they aren&#x27;t the right color you can dye them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to dye it, but thanks!</li>
      <li>Depends on where exactly you choose to purchase from.</li>
      <li>When i ordered this product back in the beginning of August i was very excited.</li>
      <li>They came really quickly, about 10 days early in fact which was awesome.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, however, I was wanting it to be a little bit lighter to match my own color</li>
      <li>It also arrived a bit before I expected :)</li>
      <li>SO, if you have light blonde hair, it won&#x27;t match.  </li>
      <li>and it turned out to be very fried and knotted.</li>
      <li>Very thin…disappointed with this product.</li>
      <li>and it looks real.</li>
      <li>The color is much darker than the picture.</li>
      <li>not quite the right color, but super long and WAY thicker than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>and I recommend this for people with straight long hair, as a cheap product.</li>
      <li>but if you have full thick hair you might one to purchase more than 1</li>
      <li>It is actually a brassy blonde, almost a very light brown.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This extension is not bad, but beware that whatever you get, may NOT be what you see in the advertised images (as I experienced lately with 6 different orders from chinese import vendors).</li>
      <li>It looks real and matches my hair, but my hair is golden blonde.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are very soft and real feeling, but cannot be straightened or curled which is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>But, you can do everything with it, you do with normal hair.</li>
      <li>They are full and thick, one group so easier to instal, the hair was smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>I believe personally they are worth it.</li>
      <li>I thought these might be a fun way to dip my toes in the water of extensions, except they were gross.</li>
      <li>I hear reviews, such as \\&quot;Not the right color/</li>
      <li>At first a lot of the hairs were already starting to fall out</li>
      <li>first then I can come back</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s fun to pull out some long hair every once in a while.</li>
      <li>More yellow than blonde not the same color as pictured</li>
      <li>However if that is what you are looking for then it is nice, soft and thick!</li>
      <li>I am a natural blonde, and my hair is really red-gold.</li>
      <li>the blonde is very brassy</li>
      <li>When I tried to straighten it parts of the hair is completely fried off</li>
      <li>They are long and pretty</li>
      <li>I really like it especially for the price.</li>
      <li>its worth the price and recommend to everybody especially if u dont want to pay 200 for the real human remy hair.</li>
      <li>I have had it for a few months now and never was able to actually wear it out.</li>
      <li>I bought another one still not thick enough</li>
      <li>its very long an its a pretty blonde I like it so far</li>
      <li>I only suggest this product if you have naturally pretty long hair</li>
      <li>This hair is very natural looking blonde.</li>
      <li>, they&#x27;re really soft, the extensions are really long, and the only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is that they tangle a little easily.</li>

<li> Also took a long time to ship.</li>
<li> at the end of the day and it was a complete waste of money</li>
<li> but its really long</li>
<li> It was WAY to long</li>
<li> , just wish it didnt take so long but being as its shipped from china</li>
<li> The item quality is not bad, but the netting/weaving is black, not at all blonde in color as teh image they posted, the hair is very long, not too thin/thick but unfortunately also NOT that medium/light blonde pictured and instead a rather DARK/REDDISHstrawberry blonde!</li>
<li> They were extremely shiny and weren&#x27;t even really blonde, sort of orangish.</li>
<li> Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that I have not yet received my order.. I have read every single review &amp; wanted to give some feedback.</li>
<li> It is a dark blonde.  </li>
<li> Other then that, complete waste and disapointment.</li>
<li> It is pretty thin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was WAY to long and it looked YELLOW and I was terrible</li>
    <li> I thought these might be a fun way to dip my toes in the water of extensions, except they were gross. It was like wearing bad barbie doll hair.</li>
    <li> I had these for maybe a week an then when I went to wash them which was recommended they fell apart. I have never been so unsatisfied in my life.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. I got it a little sooner than I thought I would but it still took up to 2 weeks. It matches my hair color perfectly the only problem is that after a while if you don&#x27;t take care of this piece and comb through it, it starts to shed. I had to trim a little bit off just so it didn&#x27;t look fried on the ends but other than that it looks good</li>
    <li> FAKE IS LIKE DOLL HAIR DO NOT BUY THIS IT LOOK VERYY VERYY FAKE.</li>
    <li> for synthetic hair its not bad. it says full head hair extensions but u only receive one which is lame. the blonde is very brassy</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde, and my hair is really red-gold. This did not match nearly as well as I expected, but it&#x27;s not too bad. It was really yellow compared to my actual hair.</li>
    <li> I mean, for 5 bucks, this thing is totally worth it. The picture accurately shows the strawberry blonde color that it is which is perfect for my hair. It was longer than I realized it would be but I successfully cut it and it looks great. It also arrived a bit before I expected :)</li>
    <li> Dear Reader,&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that I have not yet received my order.. I have read every single review &amp; wanted to give some feedback. If you have short hair, like myself, this is obviously a good purchase. I hear reviews, such as \\&quot;Not the right color/Too thin.\\&quot; Though I have yet to have received mine I would like to add these are rather less expensive so of course they won&#x27;t be as good as $300+ extensions. And if they aren&#x27;t the right color you can dye them. I believe personally they are worth it. But you never know until you try it yourself. The only problem is the shipping. Depends on where exactly you choose to purchase from. I chose the fastest because I needed these pronto. But after I ordered them I found out it would be over a month before I receive them. It is being shipped all around the world though. Purchase some today &amp; see for yourself! Anyways, hope this helped.?&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely yours, Heaven.</li>
    <li> They came really quickly, about 10 days early in fact which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is okay, they&#x27;re really soft, the extensions are really long, and the only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is that they tangle a little easily. and they&#x27;re a little bit thin, so if you&#x27;re going for a thicker look, get two or three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a short pixie cut so it&#x27;s fun to pull out some long hair every once in a while. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> This was sop posed to be blonde.  It&#x27;s red.  So of course there is no match for my costume. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This honestly was the worst things ever don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> I was so excited at first to see this product it was nicely packaged and it looks nice. Once I took it out it was very very thin and had very much extremely soft texture. When I tried to straighten it parts of the hair is completely fried off it was too thin to wear with my hair and it did not match my haircolor I managed to figure out a way to wear it for a day just to try it out and it turned out to be very fried and knotted. at the end of the day and it was a complete waste of money but I guess you get what you buy. At first a lot of the hairs were already starting to fall out but I ran some super glue along the rim like another review that I saw it worked out pretty well. I only suggest this product if you have naturally pretty long hair and you just want to make it thicker without straightening your hair and I recommend this for people with straight long hair, as a cheap product. Other then that, complete waste and disapointment.</li>
    <li> they were not what I had expected! they were to thin and the color was not what it was supposed to look like the clips were lose I wont buy these again</li>
    <li> This hair is very natural looking blonde. I was expecting a lighter blonde, like the picture. The hair was long tho just was perfect for me since I have hip length hair. The clips seems good, strong quality.</li>
    <li> looks very fake, is really thick  but looks like colored strings of fishing line! horrible product ! don&#x27;t buy .</li>
    <li> The package said it was suppose to be blonde and when I took it out of the package it was brunette and not blonde. It was the incorrect color.</li>
    <li> Blonde? Hardly. I would call the blonde color a redish blonde color. Does not match at all. Wouldnt suggest to any blonde.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking that they were thick ( they weren&#x27;t) when I got it, it was bent so I tried to make it not as bad and they wouldn&#x27;t do anything! I bought another one still not thick enough and it lost almost all of its hair I only wore them 2 times. The 2nd one I bought also was incredibly tangled. They were extremely shiny and weren&#x27;t even really blonde, sort of orangish. I would not recommend these to anyone...</li>
    <li> The hair seems to be good quality but the actual hair was waaaay off color than what&#x27;s shown. A lot darker. I&#x27;ll have to dye it, but thanks!</li>
    <li> Pay attention to the fact it is synthetic hair. However if that is what you are looking for then it is nice, soft and thick!</li>
    <li> The price is perfect................customer service is great..they care if you are satified with your order.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if you don&#x27;t like the length, just cut it</li>
    <li> Very thin…disappointed with this product. It looks extremely fake when we put it in my daughters hair. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> best quality and cheapest hair extentions i got i love them!</li>
    <li> When i ordered this product back in the beginning of August i was very excited. As time passed and i grew anxious i began reading reviews and  quickly thought i made a mistake. Although the loss was only $10 i was still sad after reading itd be fake garbage. Today it finally came, 3 days before the expected delivery, in a tiny small package. I was certain the haird be very shiny synthetic foldrd crap. To my surprise the hair was BEAUTIFUL. I really like it especially for the price. It came properly packaged, isnt fake looking at all. It blended pretty good with my hair but i plan on dying both my hair and the extensions. All n all i love it, just wish it didnt take so long but being as its shipped from china i guess it came pretty quick.</li>
    <li> very good 100% recommended</li>
    <li> The worst thing I&#x27;ve ever bought they were not good extensions at all I wore them once and the hair fell out all over the place</li>
    <li> This extension is not bad, but beware that whatever you get, may NOT be what you see in the advertised images (as I experienced lately with 6 different orders from chinese import vendors). The item quality is not bad, but the netting/weaving is black, not at all blonde in color as teh image they posted, the hair is very long, not too thin/thick but unfortunately also NOT that medium/light blonde pictured and instead a rather DARK/REDDISHstrawberry blonde! I paid $7.99 and free shipping, plus the extensions blend with my darker lowlights. I would have rated it 3 stars, but I am a sucker for integrity and I absolutely hate false advertising without remarking that the items vary upon purchase (see image)!</li>
    <li> They are full and thick, one group so easier to instal, the hair was smooth and silky. Arrived earlier then expected.</li>
    <li> It doesnt sit it my hair or any of my friends hair well at all, it contatnly falls out. Also took a long time to ship. I have had it for a few months now and never was able to actually wear it out.</li>
    <li> The color is much darker than the picture. It is actually a brassy blonde, almost a very light brown.&lt;br /&gt;They are very soft and real feeling, but cannot be straightened or curled which is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the length is longer than the picture, which may not be a bad thing for everyone. They came down to just over my butt.</li>
    <li> I must say. One of the best customer service I have ever seen on amazon. I was unhappy due to a few things with the product. The company took the extra effort to help me. I appreciate the small things like that. The color of the product is like that pictured except my clips were black not white.</li>
    <li> not quite the right color, but super long and WAY thicker than I thought it would be. when pulled into a pony tail this is almost as thick as my natural hair is! (and I have decently average hair) I don&#x27;t know what to do about the color, it says blonde, but there&#x27;s a strawberry tint to the extensions that doesn&#x27;t match my hair. Otherwise for my first fake hair purchase I really like it!</li>
    <li> this clip is really nice, my hair is naturally frizzy and volumed/wavy. i just straighten my hair and it blends well but if you have full thick hair you might one to purchase more than 1 i purchased 3 and i only got one set so far im still waiting on my other 2 but its really long and it looks real. its worth the price and recommend to everybody especially if u dont want to pay 200 for the real human remy hair. it took about 2 weeks and a couple of days thats the only bad part</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. If you have thick hair I recommend possibly buying 2. A few strands of hair will fall out at a time for me, which I don&#x27;t mind because i didn&#x27;t pay for miracle hair extensions. But they do their job, but look into the shipping details and make sure you don&#x27;t buy one that takes months to ship.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be this beautiful but it wears great and is fun, however, I was wanting it to be a little bit lighter to match my own color it is a darker blonde than I wanted.</li>
    <li> For one, the hair was not real, and I was unable to use hot tools on it. in the description it stated that I would be able to use hot tools to style the hair. I was completely unsatisfied and disappointed by the product. I don&#x27;t not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My daughters friend loved the extensions. They fir perfectly and blended with her hair perfectly. Arrived promptly and we are happy!</li>
    <li> The shipping took a while and it was not worth the wait. The color was different  I was expecting a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; extension. What i got was a very ugly yellowish/orange color and one of the clips did not close. I did contact the  seller to let them know i was unhappy with he product and wanted a refund. They got back to me  but didn&#x27;t not offer a refund , they wanted me to send them pictures instead. It was not worth the hassle. I  would not recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> It looks real and matches my hair, but my hair is golden blonde. SO, if you have light blonde hair, it won&#x27;t match.  It is pretty thin. Need more than one for it to blend into your hair.</li>
    <li> Got it before time frame it tangles really bad but I have to keep playing with it first then I can come back an say something on what I done but its very long an its a pretty blonde I like it so far</li>
    <li> Took so long to receive I forgot I&#x27;d even ordered it. Than when I took it out of the package it immediately fell apart like it WS melting in my hand ( the &#x27;hair&#x27; wasn&#x27;t sewn in correctly so it wasn&#x27;t holding any of the hair in. I was never able to use it.. wouldn&#x27;t recommend....once again ZERO STARS....</li>
    <li> Horrible product. More yellow than blonde not the same color as pictured</li>
    <li> The color does not match the picture.  It is a dark blonde.  But I am still able to use it with my hair.</li>
    <li> We can&#x27;t say enough good about this product.  It arrived quickly.  We expected it to be ultra cheap quality, &#x27;possibly&#x27;, as it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.  The outcome was phenomenal!  My Daughter used this after begging for it, because she cut her long hair off, and, hated the short hair.  This was so fun, easy, and, made her so happy! The hair was really short neck length, after the cut, and, we could still work with it.  We pulled it up into a fountain in our case, and, affixed the piece around the fountain, and, wrapped a strand around and pinned it in, (used clips to decorate around the nape of the neck and hold hair back and, over the hair).  When her hair grows longer, we will still use this piece, under and, between if she desires, to add volume or length! These things are fantastic, and, great.  We hang them on a (slacks wooden hanger), so it doesn&#x27;t tangle.  But, you can do everything with it, you do with normal hair.</li>
    <li> Great shipping and extensions are really soft! They are long and pretty and I would buy them again if I didn&#x27;t already have them.</li>
