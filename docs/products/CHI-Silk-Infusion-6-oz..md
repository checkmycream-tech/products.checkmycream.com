<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is awesome, it leaves my hair smoother when I straighten it. And if smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought CHI Silk Infusion because of so many 5 star reviews. I wanted something to soften my hair and give it little shine as well. I&#x27;ve used it several times but unfortunately felt no difference.</li>
    <li> I am nothing but pleased that I purchased Chi Silk Infusion. It has made it much easier to get through my very thick and curly hair. A little goes a long way for sure. I blow dry my hair usually every day, which means that it does show some damage. But my hair looks super healthy when I use this stuff.</li>
    <li> The smell is ok. I dont hate it or love it. But so far my hair feels the same with it or without it.</li>
    <li> Chi Silk Infusion is absolutely amazing! This product gives my hair shine without looking or feeling greasy. I simply put a nickel sized drop in my hand, rub it between my palms, then work it throughout my hair-concentrating on the ends. It can be applied to either wet or dry hair, however, I find it works best when I apply it to slightly damp hair, then blow dry. It smells nice as well. This is by far the best product I have found for making my hair silky and shiny. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, a little goes a long way. I use this every time I wash my hair - leaves it frizz free, silky, and smelling great. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t know about this sooner!</li>
    <li> I have thick, long, curly hair - the wild Dyan Cannon kinda look. When the weather changes and humidity levels are higher - my hair turns into a \\&quot;frizz ball\\&quot; and the tangles are unmanageable, and used to wash it everyday to get it worked out.  CHI silk infusion, has fixed all of this - it is the only serum/oil I use on my hair - not only does my hair NOT frizz - but the incredible smell is amazing.  I buy two or three bottles at a time as its hard to find - but Amazon usually has it in stock and the price is 60% lower - I will continue to buy this from Amazon.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND LOVE AMAZON.... I rarely buy anything anywhere else.  Thanks Amazon for making my online shopping so much easier.</li>
    <li> This product has a pleasant, but not overpowering smell. The smell is also gender neutral. It makes my hair feel healthier and stronger, while also providing a lovely sheen.  I would definitely recommend this product for use before styling. I only wish I had gotten a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this hair product. I use it daily even if I don&#x27;t use my straightener. It leaves my hair feeling smooth and the fragrance is enticing.  My hair dresser diligently tries to get me to switch to Moroccan oil, but what can I say, I&#x27;m hooked on Silk Infusion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to protect my hair when using a straightener. Not only does CHI Silk Infusion protect my hair from breakage, but it also leaves it feeling smooth and soft. This is a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hair feels soft and it&#x27;s shiny. The fragrance is OK. Smells musky, like a man&#x27;s cologne though. Still very good!</li>
    <li> I know some reviewers complain about the scent of this product, but I&#x27;ve always liked it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and finally figured out what it smells like: baby shampoo.  Good, old fashioned &#x27;no more tears&#x27;.  Sort of soapy and clean rather than the floral scents so many beauty products employ.  It makes my hair look healthier and feel smoother, but only if I use it on damp hair.  If my hair is already fully dry, then it feels oily and doesn&#x27;t really distribute through all of my hair.  I use a nickle sized portion in the palm of my hand, smear my hands together, and work it through hair that is still damp, nearer to dry than to dripping.  Then the results are nice.  I&#x27;ve actually received compliments on the scent from a beauty tech who thought I was wearing perfume when I had used no other scented products.  She was inches away from my head at the time, though, so don&#x27;t think it spreads away from you like perfume does.  I have very fine, straight, light brown hair.</li>
    <li> Best customer service I have ever had.  My shipment was delivered to an incorrect address and it was several days before I realized what had happened.  Got an instant reply from the supplier and a call from UPS that night confirming it had gone to an incorrect address.  They tried to recover it for several days and Payless Beauty called and asked me if I wanted a credit or replacement.  Great vendor, and again very satisfied with Amazon purchases.   I haven&#x27;t used this product yet, but it was a great price and I have not doubt I will like it.  Payless Beauty ROCKS!</li>
    <li> Best anti frizz on the market, hands down! Even during these humid monsoon days my hair stays beautiful all day long when I use Chi Silk.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and the challenge is to keep it in place. A few years ago one of my daughters introduced me to this product and I have stayed with it ever since. It works well and makes my hair feel and look good.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products to help with my color damaged, fine hair (I&#x27;m a natural dark blonde) but have had little luck until trying this product.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  The look and texture of the product is different from anything I have tried before.  It&#x27;s more like a syrup-y kind of serum than a creme or lotion.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.  I helps make my hair smoother, softer, and shinier - almost like a glow instead of a shine.  I&#x27;ll keep searching for other products that may work better for me but for now, this one is IT!</li>
    <li> omg i love this product i didnt really believe what people were saying about this product because people tend to exaggerate alot when talking about things they like but i decided to try it anyway.i brought the chi keratin mist first and it smelled kinda strong compared to this product but i really did like it, until i tried this product it was great and it didnt smell as strong as the keratin mist and as soon as i put it in my hair and combed it, it just glided through wow, and im a little past my perm date and my new growth is there but this product got my hair in shape all i needed to do was blowdry (i only had to blowdry with the keratin mist to) and my hair was straight now i wish i had brought a bigger bottle    ps. did you know they tried to sell this product in my local bbs for $24.00 and i paid $6.00 and some change for it online puhleeease!!!</li>
    <li> So first off, let me start by saying I have extremely damaged wavy, frizzy hair. I bleached my hair, I&#x27;ve dyed my hair, I&#x27;ve straightened my hair almost everyday for the past 7 years. Silk infusion did a great job of taming the frizz, which was my main problem. I do wish it would tame the flyaways a bit more, but I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star because I think that anyone with less damaged hair will have perfect hair after using this product. You also only really need a nickel size amount for your whole head of hair (mine is shoulder blade length). PLUS this product SMELLS AMAZING! It kind of smells like a man&#x27;s cologne, which I found extremely weird for a women&#x27;s hair product, but I love cologne, so I don&#x27;t mind it. Plus, it only smells that way when you&#x27;re putting it on. A few hours after wearing it, and the smell disappears. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair smells so good and it makes hair styling easier for me because it hold curls perfectly NO NEED FOR HAIR SPRAY ANYMORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not apply on the roots because it gets dry on my scalp and gives me dandruff.</li>
    <li> The only thing that has ever been able to tame fuzzy hair without feeling greasy. Worth the price, as I only have to use a tiny amount every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m black. I like to put this in my hair after using a hair moisturizer &amp; then put on a silk cap and in the morning my hair feels really smooth/soft and FLAT (which I like for the average day). I bought this from Amazon about a year ago, and to this day I&#x27;ve only used about 1/4 of it. A little really goes a long way. I also was attracted to this price. It&#x27;s FREAKING cheap via Amazon. At least, relatively to what it is in stores. I&#x27;m not sure if this made any real difference to my hair or protection of my hair before styling but I do like the feeling of it.</li>
    <li> I use this on African-American hair when flat ironing. It protects the ends, smells great.  It&#x27;s lightweight.  It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve used for hot styling.</li>
    <li> So happy my hairdresser turned me on to Chi.  It is the very best thing I have ever used on my impossibly thin fly away hair!&lt;br /&gt;It now stays in place, has great texture and generally a 100% improvement.</li>
    <li> My wife is blonde and uses chemical enhancement to stay that way.  Her hair takes a beating and this stuff appears to help.  I say appear because I&#x27;ve not done the research to look at her hair before and after under a microscope or done any spectrometer exams.  She swears by it and that is my final test.</li>
    <li> I started using this awhile ago and wanted to get some more, but so many places it costs way too much. I&#x27;m so happy I found this one. This stuff is amazing. I have weird, complicated hair. Seriously. It straight in the very front, the wavy and curly..Yeah, I have mixed hair, and no not just black and white. Anyway this is one of the best products you can ever own.</li>
    <li> i have straight hair &amp; very fuzzy.   Thought this product would help, but it only makes it greasy and did not help.  the smell is very awkward too.   only used it for a week and decided to quit.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff! I have used it for about ummm 8 years now. I use it every day after my shower. My hair is naturally wavy. If I want straight hair it protects it from humidity. Before my hair would get fuzzy and POOOF! This stuff makes my hair super silky and soft. It keeps my hair from drying out! A bottle lasts forever too!</li>
    <li> So I got this product after going to the salon (where my hairdresser ruined my hair) But he loved the smell! I love the product and it leaves my hair feeling great!</li>
    <li> This silk infusion product, applied prior to using a flat iron, creates soft, shiny hair.  I also like the smell of the product.  I would recommend this product if a flat iron makes your hair dry and brittle.  The silk infusion will add softness and smoothness that I haven&#x27;t found in any other product.  Just to note, I did use this product in conjunction with the CHI flat iron for best results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it makes a difference in how healthy my hair looks when it&#x27;s styled. It eliminates the straw-like dryness of processed hair.</li>
    <li> I have a thick relatively frizzy hair. this product is great as it makes my hair softer from the second time of using it. Moreover, it  isnt  oily and doesnt make my hair sticky. I recommend using it coz it is awesome</li>
    <li> Although I think the hype is a bit much, the CHI Silk Infusion does what it advertises itself to do. It definitely softens and hydrates. Only a dime size is really necessary. The perfume is somewhat like cologne. It smells good to me, not divine, but good - certainly unusual. Here on Amazon was the best deal  I have found; I saw them selling this at Target for $10 for a small 2 oz. with another one  &#x27;free,&#x27; so if you&#x27;re looking for the best deal, it doesn&#x27;t get better than here.</li>
    <li> Like other users have commented, this heat protecter has a \\&quot;men&#x27;s cologne smell\\&quot; to it; I however found that it wasn&#x27;t overpowering and it diminished after a while, leaving your hair with a light, clean smell. Overall it did what it said. It left my hair silky, soft and shiny, and protected form my InStyler. Use a little bit though because it can get greasy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Seriously.  I have very fine and VERY curly hair; I blow dry it with a round brush about 2x a week.  The product made a huuuuge difference.  Day one it was smoother and sleeker, and it still looked great on days two and three.  I will DEFINITELY be buying this again</li>
    <li> Great seller. Heard I could have got a better price else where. but @ least I saved gas money. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and I am very happy with how quickly I received it from the supplier.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> My daughter has SUPER curly hair and mine is mostly curly/wavy.  This serum is delightful for shine and taming.  It has a delicious scent and I&#x27;ve also been told it repels ukus (aka head lice-great for a kindergarten kid!)  The only thing I&#x27;d say is avoid the roots-it really weighs down the hair and makes it look too greasy.  Using on the ends and in the case of my kindergarten kid, I put it at the base of her hair, it&#x27;s a lovely thing!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, a little goes a long way. It smells great, feels silky and does your hair wonders with a heat.</li>
    <li> This is a great leave in conditioner to help your hair feel silky and look shiny.  My hair dresser used to use it and switched products so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  Seller packaged well and even taped the lid shut so it wouldn&#x27;t leak.  Definitely recommend product and Seller.</li>
    <li> Use it most days. Has a smell that people compliment. Works well for my hair which tends towards the unruly.</li>
    <li> A staple amongst all the other hair care styling products I use.  A little goes a very long way!  I use it on my ends before or after styling.  Pretty versatile as it&#x27;s good on wet or dry hair.  I started using it as a heat protectant as I blow dry my hair and use a flat iron and/or curling iron.</li>
    <li> CHI is a great product, but for me it did not have the moisture I was looking for in an oil. The oil is light and the shine is good. But, it dries the hair out very quickly.</li>
    <li> We use this on our 2 year old&#x27;s wild, curly hair.  It is the best stuff on the market.  It only takes a tiny dab.  The curls end up beautiful without the rat&#x27;s nest we were dealing with.  We were just about ready to cut off all of the curls when we found this product.</li>
    <li> Such an awesome price for this! This is a really good product. This CHI serum is much more expensive in stores. I will always order it on Amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> I have mostly 4B/C/Z hair type.  I don&#x27;t know if this is working (to be fair, I have only used it once).  I will try it again and see if it works.</li>
    <li> I found this product in a drawer, I must have got it free with something, no idea what! it says on the bottle for Hair and skin. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as I had ran out of moisturiser, I just wanted to tell people its fantastic, it&#x27;s made my complexion more even and I&#x27;m sure the wrinkles I was starting to see have reduced a bit.I am trying to find the best price to buy a new bottle now.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the CHI flat iron. They work well together. I do find my hair has a bit more static when I use this, but it definitely feels smoother and does not frizz.</li>
    <li> This item was introduced to me about 2yrs ago from my hair stylist and I fell in love with this product and it smells wonderful. It makes your hair look alive with a natural shine, it dosent even weigh your hair down. I dont wash my hair for about 3 days and my hair smells good and looks good, I crul my hair and this keeps my curls in without hairspray. Luv it!!!</li>
    <li> I can not manage without my CHI Silk Infusion.  My hairdresser introduced me to it a couple years ago.  I have been hooked ever since.  I have very thick hair, which does not like humidity.  CHI calms it down and keeps it under control, as well as nourishing the hair.  No more clown hair for me!</li>
    <li> it does make your hair waaaay softer!! but the thing is.. I ordered size (2 ounce) the first time &amp; now I just received (6 oz) I noticed that the color is different..the 2 ounce looks more yellowy &amp; the texture is a little bit thicker.. I wonder why... but other than that.. they both work just fine ..I have blonde bleached hair &amp; every time I blow dry it ..it becomes very dry but using Chi silk makes it soft &amp; shiny, Im so happy with it!</li>
    <li> A pea sized amount of this will leave your hair super silky smooth and flowy, just like the hair commercials. A little goes a long way, so if you find that your hair is oily after using this, you used too much! Smells quite nice too. The scent reminds me of men&#x27;s cologne, I believe. This product is perfect for those looking to have silky smooth straight hair. I haven&#x27;t tried it for curls, so I cannot say anything about that.</li>
    <li> This stuff was initially a 5 star for me, I recommended it to a friend, my mom, and my sister. A few months of using it and my always thick and long hair starts shedding like crazy. At first I had no idea what the cause was. I&#x27;ve had thick hair for 24 years and nothing of the sorts has ever happened. I don&#x27;t use a lot of products so after changing shampoos, I quickly realized it was this chi keratin. After a few clarifying (read: stripping) treatments, hair loss slowed and now thankfully stopped.   My mom and sister and friend all had the same experience. My theory is that the Keratin blocks the hair follicle/roots and the hair just sorta of dies. Mind you I never put it on my roots, I just rubbed it randomly all over.    My final rec: Dont do it. My gorgeous mid back length hair is now stringy and sad. As am I.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very coarse hair and a LOT of it.  As is the case with most people who have difficult hair you can find at least a dozen \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; products in my bathroom but now this is the only one I use. After drying my hair is seperate it out to flat iron it.  I just need a few drops of CHI on each section then run the straight iron over it and it helps my hair straighten more easily, feels softer and look nice and shiny.  Since it takes so little product a 6 oz bottle lasts me almost a year.  The only thing I would change is the smell which is a masculine after shave type smell but I only smell it when I first put it in my hand and it seems to dissipate quickly.</li>
    <li> Chi silk infusion is an amazing little secret! my hairdresser recommended it to me and i&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now consistently. i have long very curly hair. it&#x27;s typically dry, and frizzy. whenever i straighten my hair i put about a quarter size in my hair, maybe a little more and run my iron over it and it looks AMAZING! it&#x27;s smooth, sleek and soft. it also doesn&#x27;t frizz out in humidity. it&#x27;s the best finishing product i have ever used and believe me if you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! i definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I will admit that Chi works wonderfully but adding moisture to your hair without making it look greasy and too shinny. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because of those of us with thick hair go through the bottles pretty quickly and its not cheap.</li>
    <li> smells great like perfume!</li>
    <li> It great on your hair to get out the tangles and adds strength to the hair</li>
    <li> I love chi when blow drying and flat ironing my hair. Chi is nice to put in the hair AFTER styling hair. It is not a good heat protectant your hair will be dry.</li>
    <li> good product but im not to crazy about the scent. I haven&#x27;t used to much yet works well when straightening hair</li>
    <li> I typically have to use a very high heat setting when curling my hair. The curl stays and my hair looks pretty good, but I have noticed that it smells burnt, especially at the end of the day! I use a little silk infusion on the ends at night when I get out of the shower when my hair is wet and then again right before I curl or flat iron my hair. Not only does it protect it from the heat and keep the ends looking healthy and smooth, but it makes my hair smell great all day as well, without the greasy effect that I have seen using similar types of serum products. It is a little pricy but definately worth it. I love this product!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using it for years. Our hair is soft and smooth, not frizzy anymore. Also we use it as a conditioner. If you buy it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I absolute love the chi silk infusion. I use it every time I wash my hair and it leaves it feeling silky and fresh with an added gorgeous shine</li>
    <li> Good price on a product I love. Will buy from here again. This stuff is so great for damaged hair!</li>
    <li> I feel soft and smooth hair after applying this product. Great product for frizzy hair. I would definitely recommend this item to my friends.</li>
    <li> I am biracial and this stuff does WONDERS for my hair. I use it with my flat iron and it helps my hair stay shiny and moisturized. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Helps get rid of friz and make my hair look more smooth when I use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in the store. The packaging different and the color and smell of the product also differs from what I&#x27;ve purchased previouly</li>
    <li> Most times my hair does not respond to oils but this one, my hair absorbs it so easily that it is almost like magic. I have bought the knock off versions of this product and it is not the same as the real thing.Love it ,would recommend using a little at a time since,this stuff is that good. Your hair will definitely thank you for this purchase.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORK VERY WELL. IT LEAVES THE HAIR SOFT AND BOUNCY, FREE OF DRYNESS.  THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE, CHEAPER THAN OTHER RETAILERS. THANKS AMAZON FOR FAST SHIPMENT.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loved using this on her over treated hair.  Unfortunately she does not live with me anymore so no need to purchase more.</li>
    <li> Pricey and just ok.  Not too impressed for the price.  No real complaints though just not worth money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I started using this years ago after my stylist recommended it for my hair type. I have very dry, fine, blonde hair and this stuff really seems to give it some life. It makes my hair very smooth and helps keep the style in place. Just be careful, because a little goes a very long way in this case and using too much has a tendency to make your hair look greasy. Just a dime sized amount is all you need!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have dry, coarse hair. I use this as a heat protectant when my hair is wet. (dime-sized amount in palm, then work through hair, avoiding roots.) Then before I flat iron, I put a TINY amount in my palm, and work through each section before I flat iron it. It makes my hair so shiny! And a little goes a long way. Love this stuff! And I like the smell too :)</li>
    <li> Got this for my Chinese wife, and unlike the relaxing kit which was a complete waste of money, this product is like liquid gold for her hair. She complains that her hair gets dirty easily because it leaves a slightly oily residue on the hair, but it leaves it super soft and beautifully shiny. If you have thick, or very dry hair this stuff is awesome...wish I had bought more.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for thick (really thick and curly) hair.  It is great to use in the mornings when there is a tangled almost unmanageable mess.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC.  A must if you use a flat-iron.</li>
    <li> This is a nice oil that is light and residue less. It leaves your hair with a shine on your hair as if you put nothing on it. A natural shiny look.</li>
    <li> Love these products. I have fine hair and this oil does not weight it down, and also lots of allergies to perfumes and dyes. I have not had any problems with either with this product.</li>
    <li> Need I say more? My once beautiful and shoulder length hair had become a total nightmare! I had the brilliant idea of getting my hair cut into a short bob. Apparently the stylist didn&#x27;t know much about African American hair because since then, my hair has been a butchered, broken mess. I don&#x27;t know what happened, but all of a sudden my hair was frizzy, damaged, and impossible to manage. That&#x27;s when I decided to try CHI Silk Infusion. From the first dime-sized drop, I could tell my hair was on it&#x27;s way to making a recovery. Honestly, my hair immediately felt silky, shiny, and I had no more fly-aways! I only use it every 2-3 days and my hair looks healthier each day! This is truly my miracle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> This definitely does the job, my ends are significantly softer after I apply a very small amount of this, running it through with my fingers (in damp or dry hair) but I cant get over the odor; Its hideous, it reminds me of when you open a closet that&#x27;s been closed for a lot of time. Eek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution that I found for this, considering that I dont like to let to waste products, is that I use it mixed with other hair creams, make a mask and let it set for 15min and rinsing it with warm water and then proceed with shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  It makes my hair feel soft and pretty smooth after use.  I like to use it right after I shower by taking a TINY amount and putting it on my bottom half of my hair.  Another way I like to use it is after flat ironing- I take a tiny amount and run it through my hair from top to bottom and voila-it&#x27;s smooth and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, only use a very SMALL amount otherwise your hair will end up looking very oily</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hair almost everyday and I LOVE it. It was reccomended to me by a hair dresser and it always makes my hair feel soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> it works good on my hair i have used it for years, I have tried other stuff and I still go back to Chi product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does help straighten but it leaves my hair feeling weighed down and greasy.  I prefer a lighter oil spray when I&#x27;m blow drying and straightening.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  I have fine, thin hair that tangles easily.  I keep it permed and if I didn&#x27;t use this product every day I would not be able to get a comb or pick through my hair.  I have used this product for many years and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve known about CHI products for a long time and never bought them because I would end up trying a cheaper version of the product hoping it would do what I wanted.  I suffer from lots of smaller, broken pieces of hair that end up standing up and making my hair look frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff... lemme tell you... It is far superior than any other product I&#x27;ve tried and I feel as though it really is giving my hair the needed strength and shine.  A little goes a long way, so I feel as if I&#x27;ll absolutely get my money&#x27;s worth from this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY gripe about this product is the scent.  My boyfriend told me I smelled like an old man once - I am pretty sure its from the strong cologne-line scent the product has, but honestly, I could care less.  The smell isn&#x27;t offensive or distracting (to me) and it does the job flawlessly, so its an easy 5 stars in my book!</li>
