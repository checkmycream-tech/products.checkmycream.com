      <li>And good size.</li>
      <li>Really good for your guest closets--</li>
      <li>Not quite as good (smell) as the one I had bought from BB&amp;Beyond.</li>
      <li>Good value for the money</li>
      <li>Good for pressing linens and tablecloths, and helps retain the pressed look.</li>
      <li>Moths do not like lavender, so it is also a good protection for closets to have items sprayed with lavender in them.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I was hoping it would.</li>
      <li>This Linen water is very good smelling and not too strong...</li>
      <li>Very lovely, not overpowering, smell.  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied with this Lavender water.</li>

      <li>It makes linens smell so fresh and wonderful.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>

      <li>Delivery was very fast, great to work with!</li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>Smells great with a light starch.</li>
      <li>really great, light smell.  </li>
      <li>The bottles are refills so you need your own spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>Wish I could say I liked it...but can&#x27;t</li>
      <li>But, it didn&#x27;t smell as nice as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>I tried this along with another product and would say if you want something to add a nice scent to your clothes, this is it.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is VERY light, but nice.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s old fashioned, but in the best sense.</li>
      <li>I use this mostly on my bed linens,to make the bed and mostly to store them.</li>
      <li>Love product definitely enjoying it and would buy again.</li>
      <li>The reason I still gave it 4 stars is because I&#x27;m sure with the close contact of an iron it probably works much better...</li>
      <li>I have been looking for authentic lavender linen spray for a while, so tried this even though it seemed overpriced.</li>
      <li>Surely the world has not run out of lavendar?</li>
      <li>My entire linen closet smells dreamy and my linens iron wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Too many adjectives?</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It does not stain but leaves a nice clean lavender smell to my clothes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;a pretty good size bottle for your money</li>
      <li>The pleasant scent lasts and sheets are nearly wrinkle free.  </li>
      <li>it helps smooth out wrinkles</li>
      <li>Prefer a much stonger lavender scent, but this was nice for using on our bed linens.</li>
      <li>This makes the feel and smell of fresh cleaned sheets even better....</li>
      <li>No starch, just a light scent of lavender.  </li>
      <li>I use this for all my ironing and my clothes and sheets always smell light and clean.</li>
      <li>I smell every lavender spray there is out there in every store I go into,... and NONE  have the clean , fresh , soothing scent of this lavender linen blossom by Pre de Probence !</li>
      <li>But nice enough and the price was OK.</li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use - great for linen closet to keep it fresh and of course for bed linens</li>
      <li>Product arrived on time and was easy to start using right away.  </li>
      <li>Also great to spray on towels, bedsheets and pillowcases before drying; leaves a nice, subtle, clean smell.</li>
      <li>Everytime the clothes come out fresh and wrinkle free.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff to refresh the bed linens in mid-week after the bed has been slept in, but is not yet ready for the laundry.</li>
      <li>Would love to see gallon size or bigger really love lavender linen water.</li>
      <li>This linen water is ok for the purpose for which I purchased it,  I have purchased other brands of linen water which were more strongly fragranced.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product &amp; goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Always makes my ironing smell so fresh.  </li>
      <li>It leaves the with a fresh Lavender scent.</li>
      <li>love my lavender water   thanks so much   </li>
      <li>Could be me, but am not crazy about this product.</li>
      <li>Not only does it leave a nice fresh smell</li>
      <li>Therefore, the price per quantity is important and 33.8 ounces are more than adequate as many smaller spray bottles cost the same.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of</li>
      <li>We used to buy a similar spray for linens at Bed Bath and Beyond but haven&#x27;t been able to find it so tried Amazon and like this one very much.  </li>
      <li>This is the third bottle I have ordered from Amazon and have always been pleased with the product and the timely manner of delivery.</li>
      <li>light scent - not heavy perfume scent like some</li>
      <li>very relaxing when going to bed.</li>
      <li>The Pre de Provence does not smell like real lavender.  </li>
      <li>better is their lemon verbena, but it seems to be harder to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Caldera.</li>
      <li>A spray bottle, and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really smell like lavender.  </li>
      <li>I love to spray this on my sheets and other linens when I iron them.  </li>
      <li>Smells good but was disappointed that it is not as potent as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>I had to remove and replace my ironing board cover and get a new one.</li>
      <li>The bottle does look nice just sitting there but as far as the scent this has been a huge disappointment.</li>
      <li>Online directions say to spray it directly on the fabric and bottle instructions say to pour it in the steam reservoir of the iron.  </li>
      <li>If you are a person who likes to iron their clothes rather than dry or dry clean them, this is an added incentive to do so.</li>
      <li>A light spray on linens before folding or clothing before ironing leaves a very faint but clean smell (not perfumy).  </li>
      <li>Oh... I like this stuff but... it loses its potency of smell too quickly.</li>

    <li> I tried this along with another product and would say if you want something to add a nice scent to your clothes, this is it.  No starch, just a light scent of lavender.  Good for pressing linens and tablecloths, and helps retain the pressed look.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was easy to start using right away.  Prefer a much stonger lavender scent, but this was nice for using on our bed linens.</li>
    <li> This is a good product &amp; goes a long way.  The scent is pleasing to the noise &amp; favorable to the linen. Good Deal!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for authentic lavender linen spray for a while, so tried this even though it seemed overpriced. The Pre de Provence does not smell like real lavender.  It is not as strongly scented as other linen sprays - very weak and seems watered down.  It smells vaguely sweet and perfumey (but not sickly sweet and strongly perfumey as some other fake lavender linen sprays). I have some Asquith and Somerset French Lavender spray that I&#x27;m using as the benchmark.  The A&amp;S smells like the lavender in my garden, but I&#x27;m running out of it and can no longer find it. So the quest continues.</li>
    <li> I use lavender linen water for my sheets when I remove them from the dryer - saves ironing.  The pleasant scent lasts and sheets are nearly wrinkle free.  Therefore, the price per quantity is important and 33.8 ounces are more than adequate as many smaller spray bottles cost the same.</li>
    <li> love my lavender water   thanks so much   its hard to find</li>
    <li> I used this water with my steamer, not an iron, and it smelled just wonderful when I was steaming, but my clothes stopped smelling like lavender almost immediately. The reason I still gave it 4 stars is because I&#x27;m sure with the close contact of an iron it probably works much better... It just doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well with my steamer. Still smells great though :)</li>
    <li> If you are a person who likes to iron their clothes rather than dry or dry clean them, this is an added incentive to do so. Instead of dreadful dryer sheets that make everything you wear smell like bad deoderant (you know what I mean...) this product leaves just a trace of lavendar in the air, rather like the plant itself. There&#x27;s no middle untold chemical in the way. Your house smells good when you iron, and then your closet smells nice when you hang your shirts there. It&#x27;s old fashioned, but in the best sense. I dilute mine with water, three parts water to one part lavendar water. A spray bottle, and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better is their lemon verbena, but it seems to be harder to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Caldera. They have inserted some middle note that smells like tobacco. I had to remove and replace my ironing board cover and get a new one. If you smoke you might like it. If you don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t go there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder why my order has now taken six weeks to get. Still no sign of it. Surely the world has not run out of lavendar?</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this Lavender water. My wife uses it as a final rinse for her Nylon Stockings and Linens. It leaves the with a fresh Lavender scent.</li>
    <li> I smell every lavender spray there is out there in every store I go into,... and NONE  have the clean , fresh , soothing scent of this lavender linen blossom by Pre de Probence ! I order 4 bottles at a time &#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this product.  A light spray on linens before folding or clothing before ironing leaves a very faint but clean smell (not perfumy).  Moths do not like lavender, so it is also a good protection for closets to have items sprayed with lavender in them.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I have since bought another bottle. My entire linen closet smells dreamy and my linens iron wonderfully. Too many adjectives?</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for years and I love it!  It is a perfect light spray for pillows, towels, even clothing! I use it all around the house to help freshen up linens in all my rooms.</li>
    <li> I use this for all my ironing and my clothes and sheets always smell light and clean. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for one of my daughters.  She said that it is very refreshing to use and she is very pleased.</li>
    <li> This Linen water is very good smelling and not too strong...but then that&#x27;s a matter of taste usually. Good value for the money</li>
    <li> really great, light smell.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product after searching everywhere for lavender linen spray.  Smells great in the bottle, but cannot smell it on the fabric.  Online directions say to spray it directly on the fabric and bottle instructions say to pour it in the steam reservoir of the iron.  I tried it both ways and neither method held the scent past ironing.  This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love to spray this on my sheets and other linens when I iron them.  It helps to get the wrinkles out and they spell wonderful.</li>
    <li> It was a great price. And good size. But, it didn&#x27;t smell as nice as I thought it would. It&#x27;s a MAYBE buy again.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good (smell) as the one I had bought from BB&amp;Beyond. But nice enough and the price was OK. I use this (diluted with water) to spray my cotton and linen shirts and dresses after removing from the dryer...it helps smooth out wrinkles so I don&#x27;t have to iron. Also great to spray on towels, bedsheets and pillowcases before drying; leaves a nice, subtle, clean smell. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I use this mostly on my bed linens,to make the bed and mostly to store them.Really good for your guest closets--</li>
    <li> Seller has great product at a great price! Delivery was very fast, great to work with! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells great with a light starch. Everything you iron from bed sheets to pillow cases, blouses and slacks smell great. I put some in a spray bottle and also in the water tank of the iron.</li>
    <li> I use lavender water on my bed linens daily when making the bed... very relaxing when going to bed. This is the third bottle I have ordered from Amazon and have always been pleased with the product and the timely manner of delivery.</li>
    <li> Great price and it smells wonderful when sprayed on towels and sheets.  I purchased a spray nozzle separately as it does not come with one.</li>
    <li> Love product definitely enjoying it and would buy again. Would love to see gallon size or bigger really love lavender linen water.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff to refresh the bed linens in mid-week after the bed has been slept in, but is not yet ready for the laundry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use in the dry when my shirts were mistakenly left in over night and were wrinkled.  Not only does it leave a nice fresh smell it releases the wrinkles beautifully.  I pour about two capfuls on a cloth and run the dryer.  Everytime the clothes come out fresh and wrinkle free.</li>
    <li> This makes the feel and smell of fresh cleaned sheets even better....</li>
    <li> Smells good but was disappointed that it is not as potent as I had hoped. The scent once sprayed does not last. You get&lt;br /&gt;a pretty good size bottle for your money but now I know you will need it.</li>
    <li> We used to buy a similar spray for linens at Bed Bath and Beyond but haven&#x27;t been able to find it so tried Amazon and like this one very much.  The bottles are refills so you need your own spray bottle.  It makes linens smell so fresh and wonderful.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is VERY light, but nice.  I thought it would have a much stronger Lavender fragrance, similar to other Linen sprays I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  Not worth sending back, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really smell like lavender.  It looks like tinted water that smells like detergent, but not lavender. The bottle does look nice just sitting there but as far as the scent this has been a huge disappointment.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Just the right amount of light scent - not heavy perfume scent like some - it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use - great for linen closet to keep it fresh and of course for bed linens</li>
    <li> Very lovely, not overpowering, smell.  Adds a delightful freshness to bed linens.  I had previously had some difficulty replacing the container I had so was very glad to find the refills.</li>
    <li> This linen water is ok for the purpose for which I purchased it,  I have purchased other brands of linen water which were more strongly fragranced.  I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> Mmmm.....freshnesssssss!</li>
    <li> I used this in my laundry.  It does not stain but leaves a nice clean lavender smell to my clothes.  I wish it was a bit stronger but it will do.</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed it wasn&#x27;t the same scent I like best but will use it for sure.  Always makes my ironing smell so fresh.  I also use it for sewing projects.</li>
    <li> Could be me, but am not crazy about this product. It arrived on time and in tact! Wish I could say I liked it...but can&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Oh... I like this stuff but... it loses its potency of smell too quickly.Also, it is expensive enough to have a longer lasting fragrance. Boo hiss bah</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I was hoping it would.</li>
    <li> my wife sprays both of us with this lavender before bedtime--it smells great!</li>
