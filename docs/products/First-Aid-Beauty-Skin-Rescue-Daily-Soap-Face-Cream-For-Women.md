    <li> My skin&#x27;s a bit too dry for this cream.</li>
    <li> I started using this moisturizer about a year and a half ago when I decided my break outs were due to sensitive skin (I just turned 30, so I figured I didn&#x27;t exactly have teenager skin any more!). My skin has dramatically improved since starting to use this product. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I broke out. It&#x27;s nice and light, not greasy at all. I use it in the morning under my make up and at night after I wash my face. I wash my make up off with aveeno ultra calming foaming face wash, which is also for sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m thinking of trying the first aid beauty face wash as well since I like the moisturizer so much. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. Last a long time and goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream, it has great ingredients for your skin and never leaves my face feeling oily or gross.  It absorbs into my skin right away and feels good, I use it in the morning before applying my make up.</li>
    <li> Not sticky, goes on smooth and light.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, very gentle.  Skin looks as good as it feels.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream but too expensive for how little comes in the bottle.  Try Neutrogena&#x27;s face moisturizer with daily spf15.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great for my oily skin. It keeps my skin soft and dewy but never leaves it greasy. I love the lightness of it.</li>
    <li> If you have super dry skin, this is the stuff to use. I had some dry patches around my cheeks during the winter, so I ordered this cream. It worked like a charm! This was my first moisturizer and it&#x27;s my last!</li>
    <li> this is the best ever daily face cream, it is light and a great moisturizer! I have naturally oily skin, a lot of times us oily skin people don&#x27;t think we need to moisturize but we do! with this moisturizer I have less oil on my face throughout the day than i do when i don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This product Absorbs fast. Is Not sticky. Works great on my sensitive skin. Will be reordering it again for sure.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face cream. It&#x27;s not thick and goes on very smooth. It&#x27;s not sticky at all. I use it under a primer and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s very light and best used during the day. I am on my 5th bottle of this stuff! No harsh chemicals that irritate my skin. I used it while I was pregnant too without any problems. I highly recommend. The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t have SPF.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.. Nice and light for this warmer climate, but the bottle only last a month</li>
    <li> I am older and have very dry skin and I did not notice any difference in my skin after using the entire bottle of cream.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this stuff. It&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer, keeps my face soft and clear but not greasy, if only it wasn&#x27;t so pricey. A little goes a long way, but I&#x27;m waiting for the day I find a jumbo sized bottle at a discount.</li>
    <li> This daily lotion is so smooth and creamy without being greasy.  I have very dry, mature skin and this has a wonderful texture.  It goes on very light and feels great.  It is non-comedigenic and my makeup goes on very nicely and stays nice all day.  It is not gummy or too emollient - just right!  Also, I have spent so much money on more expensive creams with little result.  This product is very reasonably priced- another bonus!</li>
    <li> This product is overrated because of the price. At $10 an ounce this product does not deliver much more than store-bought brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oil skin and while this moisturizer is lightweight and absorbs quickly, I haven&#x27;t experienced any benefits worth $20 for the bottle. For example, compared to my store-bought moisturizer, Cetaphil with the pump, the only benefit I witnessed with First Aid Beauty&#x27;s Daily Face Cream is my skin is less shiny at the end of the day. Both are fragrance free, provide ample moisture, and apply smoothly. However, this little 2oz bottle is not worth $20.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, so what do I know?  But I&#x27;m a guy with sensitive skin, especially around the face where I hack at it every day with a razor.  This is my go-to skin cream to keep my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, to repair the depredations of the razor, and to defy age.</li>
    <li> My skin is combination oily and I was looking for a new moisturizer to replace my old Clinique moisturizer lotion/gel (it just was doing it for me anymore). I tried a sample of this at sephora and I liked it bought it again. I looked on amazon and found it $7 dollars cheaper than at sephora. The moisturizer itself is light but heavy enough for moisture. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product to accomplish the result</li>
    <li> Light but moisturizing :) I really like this face cream and use it morning and night</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! Really moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily and shiny. Leaves you perfectly matte and I don&#x27;t get greasy all day.</li>
    <li> for oilier skin and acne, this is great: it&#x27;s super lightweight but moisturizing. as i get older my skin&#x27;s getting drier so i add a few drops of jojoba oil to this. super gentle.</li>
    <li> This product has proven to a great moisturizer for winter, and I&#x27;m sure summer too. It goes on sheer, doesn&#x27;t induce pimples like some others I&#x27;ve recently tried, and helps my skin to feel pleasant.</li>
