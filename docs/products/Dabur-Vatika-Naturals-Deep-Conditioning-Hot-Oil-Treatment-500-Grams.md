      <li>great product does what it says my hair was soft, easy to manage just a over all product, will be ordering another one soon</li>

      <li>Huge container.</li>
      <li>It makes a huge difference in manageability.</li>

      <li>Smells amazing and actually makes your hair feel amazing and soft.</li>
      <li>The smell is a tad incense-y but not unpleasant (to me), the texture a bit goopy, and some of the ingredients made me raise my eyebrows (MARROW EXTRACT??</li>
      <li>one quick wash with Aphogee&#x27;s shampoo for damaged hair to get out the excess oil, then follow that up with a good cleansing using Hair One&#x27;s olive oil cleansing conditioner for dry hair</li>
      <li>I use the vatika oil and this deep conditioner on top!</li>
      <li>&quot; Vatika that seems to be (at first glance) quite vegetarian friendly.</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of leave in conditioners, but I was raised to believe healthy hair was not bouncy and weightless but heavy, lustrous, smoothly flowing, and with not a single fly away in sight.</li>
      <li>I love the way my hair feels when I use this, its soft and luxurious.</li>
      <li>Love this makes hair soft with lots of shine</li>
      <li>I love the natural and Ayurvedic approaches to skin and hair care in Indian culture and Indian products, so I figured I&#x27;d go ahead and try</li>
      <li>It softens and conditions hair well without being heavy or greasy and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>My scalp gets oily because of hats, and my ends are super dry, and this mostly makes me look like I was struck by lightening...</li>
      <li>I have fine naturally curly hair and most deep conditioners</li>
      <li>It really does work!</li>
      <li>I went for the Hair Fall Control hot oil treatment that contains garlic, coconut and cactus, which I don&#x27;t see listed on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I use this conditioner as a hot oil treatment each Friday night</li>
      <li>but it turned out to be more like a deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I thought i was getting a Hot Oil Treatment when I was purchasing it</li>
      <li>Most western brands have not given me that.</li>
      <li>on to the hot oil treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I hot oil</li>
      <li>Coconut oil works best to moisturize very dry black hair.</li>
      <li>My hair, after washing with a different shampoo, was easy to manage, soft, silky and felt nice (even though it still smelled a bit gross)</li>
      <li>After gently blow drying and flat ironing, my hair looked way better than it looks when I leave the salon:</li>
      <li>The large bottle of the oil is $4.99</li>
      <li>Chicago winters just make it sulk harder, fiercer and with more tenacity.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>They are not oily, they are very moisturizing and do not leave residue.</li>
      <li>My hair was also much easier to style after ironing it.</li>
      <li>It also appears to have turned my blonde-tipped hair a dingy color, for which i was very upset.</li>
      <li>me or made it worth using this when I can buy something of equal price that will do the same thing and smell much better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s MUCH softer, has body, is bouncy, is WAY easier to comb</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exact, even set a timer when normally I do the &amp;#</li>
      <li>You can add oils and honey to it if you want but it really doesn&#x27;t need anything added.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think my hair really likes it.  </li>
      <li>When I wash it out, my hair is noticeably softer and it really keeps moisture in my hair throughout the week without making it look oily.  </li>
      <li>My hair stays much softer and moisturized with the Vatika coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;After reading many black hair blogs about doing hot oil \\&quot;pre-poos\\</li>
      <li>/&gt;***A QUICK TIP: If you live near Indian grocery stores, go there to get these products.  </li>
      <li>To strong but overall my hair turn out to be very soft.</li>
      <li>I was low on the coconut oil and went to my local Indian grocery to get some more to do my hot oil treatment.</li>
      <li>This product did nothing more than make my hair extremely greasy.</li>
      <li>Its a yellow cream color with a unique smell but the smell washes out well.  </li>
      <li>After doing the treatment and doing my final rinse before styling, I was able to very easily comb through my hair with a fine-toothed comb with only a few strands coming out.</li>
      <li>It has given my once-healthy, now damaged hair new life after just two uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still very soft, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
      <li>I have African American healthy coarse hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using the root strengthening conditioner, the Vatika Naturals Deep Conditioning Hot Oil Treatment and the Vatika oil.</li>
      <li>&quot; or co-washes (doing hot oil treatments or deep conditioning before washing), I decided to give that a try.</li>
      <li>and I saw the Vatika Naturals hot oil treatments on the shelf next to them.</li>
      <li>so obviously it did something positive.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and well to manage now.</li>
      <li>no matter how much I rinsed, until I ended up reshampooing with a different brand (through which I could still smell this)</li>
      <li>Did nothing for my usually soft, Afro hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional hair stylist.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair is healthy, and perfectly well behaved, pretty much throughout the year except in winter when it ...just...sulks. Chicago winters just make it sulk harder, fiercer and with more tenacity. My scalp gets oily because of hats, and my ends are super dry, and this mostly makes me look like I was struck by lightening...while wearing an invisible skullcap. I have tried a lot of leave in conditioners, but I was raised to believe healthy hair was not bouncy and weightless but heavy, lustrous, smoothly flowing, and with not a single fly away in sight. Most western brands have not given me that. This one delivered. The smell is a tad incense-y but not unpleasant (to me), the texture a bit goopy, and some of the ingredients made me raise my eyebrows (MARROW EXTRACT?? The vegetable or the stuff in bones??), and they seem to love their lactose analogies- flowing like cream, creamy smoothness and that made me giggle throughout the shampooing process (I am easily amused).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, after shampooing, I squeezed out excess water, applied to hair, wrapped with saran wrap since it was laundry day, had breakfast (20 minutes) and rinsed thoroughly and my hair looked healthy, heavy, seriously lustrous, with not a fly away in sight, all what my mother has insisted for more than 3 decades are the signs of the nicest hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is not the \\&quot;Indian\\&quot; Vatika that seems to be (at first glance) quite vegetarian friendly. It is a Middle Eastern product (Dubai). Thus, you might wish to check on that marrow extract thing, if you are vegan, or if using animal based products bothers you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but it seems to leave a residue on my hair and makes it look dull and greasy not happy with this buy so far</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner as a hot oil treatment each Friday night and I really like it. It softens and conditions hair well without being heavy or greasy and it has a pleasant scent. In my opinion it is best used as a deep conditioner. You can add oils and honey to it if you want but it really doesn&#x27;t need anything added. it works great on its own. The price is good as well. it&#x27;s a hair staple for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. I am very happy with my purchase after one use. It also has a great clean &amp; fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I love it best buy ever. I will be buy more.</li>
    <li> Love this makes hair soft with lots of shine</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my usually soft, Afro hair.  Actually felt like it dried it out a bit at worst, and did nothing at best.</li>
    <li> I love the Vatika products. My hair loves and thirst for them. I&#x27;m using the root strengthening conditioner, the Vatika Naturals Deep Conditioning Hot Oil Treatment and the Vatika oil. They are not oily, they are very moisturizing and do not leave residue. Good products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hair stylist. And I use this on my clients who hair is very dry. It works amazing! I put them under the dryer for 15-20 minutes. I can tell a big difference after I blow dry their hair. And a bigger difference when I flat iron it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!I colored my hair and this was the only deep conditioning treatment that helped my hair stop breaking off!</li>
    <li> I used this before I shampoo and I absolutely love it. My hair feels amazing. I think I will use this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> My unruly hair could not be happier, this is the best product I&#x27;ve encountered that leaves my hair healthy and with moisture!</li>
    <li> I usually use this once a week.  I shampoo my hair, apply this product and leave it in for about an hour.  When I wash it out, my hair is noticeably softer and it really keeps moisture in my hair throughout the week without making it look oily.  This is a big must have for someone who washes their hair a couple times a week and doesn&#x27;t like the ends looking dried out from heating products!</li>
    <li> This product moisturized my hair but didnt make it feel oily  I have fine naturally curly hair and most deep conditioners weigh it down but this didnt. My hair retains moisture better and its soooooooooo shiny</li>
    <li> This conditioner has the perfect consistency and has been a great addition to my bi-weekly regimen. I&#x27;ll be a using this for years to come! Great product! :)</li>
    <li> I have damaged hair from compulsively dying it, and recently it started breaking when i simply run my fingers through it.  I bought this along with the shampoo and conditioner, used this once, and never again. The smell is awful, the product left my hair greasy no matter how much I rinsed, until I ended up reshampooing with a different brand (through which I could still smell this). It also appears to have turned my blonde-tipped hair a dingy color, for which i was very upset. I followed the directions exact, even set a timer when normally I do the &amp;#34;wing it&amp;#34; method because I was trying a new product that I thought was going to be very strong. My roots were thick and greasy the first time I rinsed, so after towel drying I decided rinsing again. Still greasy. My hair, after washing with a different shampoo, was easy to manage, soft, silky and felt nice (even though it still smelled a bit gross) so obviously it did something positive. But it was way more hassle than it was worth and there was nothing about this that &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; me or made it worth using this when I can buy something of equal price that will do the same thing and smell much better.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing more than make my hair extremely greasy. Do not use this product or you&#x27;ll just be wasting your money.</li>
    <li> I thought i was getting a Hot Oil Treatment when I was purchasing it but it turned out to be more like a deep conditioner.  Its a yellow cream color with a unique smell but the smell washes out well.  I let it sit on my hair for 45 mins under a plastic cap and the results were ok.  Next time I&#x27;ll try using it with a heating cap and see it that will have a deeper condition.  I need a good deep oil condition because I relax and color my hair and my hair tends to be dry.  I guess I had higher hopes because of the other reviews.  I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if my hair improves over time.</li>
    <li> The product is great for slip but it irritated my scalp. I am not sure if it left my hair moisturize. But it is great for slip.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about a month ago.  Don&#x27;t think my hair really likes it.  It has henna in it.  I have African American healthy coarse hair.</li>
    <li> I have been a long-time user of the Vatika coconut-amla oil and I love it. I bought into the Moroccan hair oil craze, and while it&#x27;s alright, it&#x27;s very expensive and I found that the Vatika works way better on my hair I get way more oil at a much more affordable price. My hair stays much softer and moisturized with the Vatika coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***A QUICK TIP: If you live near Indian grocery stores, go there to get these products.  The large bottle of the oil is $4.99 and I paid $7.99 for the treatment.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the hot oil treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that I am African-American with very course, very thick relaxed hair that has been breaking like crazy the last few years. My hair was in desperate need of moisture. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of very expensive shampoos and conditioners and it was to the point that even professional stylists couldn&#x27;t tell me what to do to save my hair. Even Aphogee&#x27;s protein treatment did nothing to stop my hair breakage. The last time I did that protein treatment, I still had LOTS of breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many black hair blogs about doing hot oil \\&quot;pre-poos\\&quot; or co-washes (doing hot oil treatments or deep conditioning before washing), I decided to give that a try. I was low on the coconut oil and went to my local Indian grocery to get some more to do my hot oil treatment. I grabbed two bottles of the oil and I saw the Vatika Naturals hot oil treatments on the shelf next to them. I looked over the different jars to see what would work best for my hair breakage.  I went for the Hair Fall Control hot oil treatment that contains garlic, coconut and cactus, which I don&#x27;t see listed on Amazon. At first I thought I&#x27;ve already spent a fortune on hair products and nothing is working and this will probably be another waste of money. I love the natural and Ayurvedic approaches to skin and hair care in Indian culture and Indian products, so I figured I&#x27;d go ahead and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very dryand sheds and breaks a lot when combing or washing and there is lots of \\&quot;drag\\&quot; when combing wet with a large-toothed comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I do the treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I apply it to my dry hair. I part my hair in sections and apply the treatment to my scalp and to my hair from roots to ends, then add a few drops of the coconut oil to each section after applying the deep conditioning hot oil treatment. I massage each section, then I knot and clip each section and put on a plastic cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I sit under a hooded dryer for 10-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I get in the shower and wash out the treatment--one quick wash with Aphogee&#x27;s shampoo for damaged hair to get out the excess oil, then follow that up with a good cleansing using Hair One&#x27;s olive oil cleansing conditioner for dry hair (Sally&#x27;s). I comb through in shower, leave on 2-3 minutes then rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I then deep condition with a conditioner cocktail for 10-20 minutes (using moisturizing and protein conditioners) with plastic cap under hooded dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I rinse then style, gently blow drying on a cooler setting and flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only done the treatment twice so far, the second treatment being done on yesterday, 4/20/13.  Let me tell you that there is been INSTANT improvement in my hair after doing this treatment!  I&#x27;d been doing steps 3-5 on hair every week yet I&#x27;ve still had to deal with dryness and breakage. After doing the treatment and doing my final rinse before styling, I was able to very easily comb through my hair with a fine-toothed comb with only a few strands coming out. I was NEVER able to do that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 1 4/20/13  (immediately after treatment, washing and conditioning)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I blew it dry, again, there was much less hair coming out.  I normally loose lots of hair when I blow dry.  I had to stop roller setting because my hair was so hard and dry that my roller sets would also come out hard and dry and I&#x27;d lose alot of hair when combing out the curls. After gently blow drying and flat ironing, my hair looked way better than it looks when I leave the salon: it&#x27;s MUCH softer, has body, is bouncy, is WAY easier to comb and I can run my fingers through my hair with ease. There was also less hair breakage as I flat ironed it. My hair was also much easier to style after ironing it. It also straightens better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out with friends and all they talked about was how great my hair looked. When I came home I wrapped my hair before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 2 4/21/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed my scarf to comb my wrap out with the wide-toothed comb. Two or three passes with the comb and my hair fell instantly into place, something it hasn&#x27;t done in a very long time. It&#x27;s still very soft, shiny, and bouncy. I combed my hair out to see if I would lose a lot of strands. ABSOLUTELY NO HAIR BROKE OFF WHEN I COMBED MY HAIR!!! NONE!!! Any time I manipulate my hair in any way, there&#x27;s always lots of breakage.  Not this time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dealing with years of breakage and spending hundreds of dollars, I think I&#x27;ve finally found a product that will help me get my hair back healthy that isn&#x27;t at all expensive.  It really does work! I can&#x27;t stop touching and running my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any woman of African descent with relaxed hair that is dry and breaking off, I highly recommend this product.  It has given my once-healthy, now damaged hair new life after just two uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Another note: For black hair use the Vatika hot oil treatment for hair fall that contains the coconut oil.  Coconut oil works best to moisturize very dry black hair.</li>
