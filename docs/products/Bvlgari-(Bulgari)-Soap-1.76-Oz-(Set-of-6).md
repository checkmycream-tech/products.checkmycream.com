<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> always love this soap since  we cruise on luxury cruise last year and always perk me up everytime when I use it.</li>
    <li> I had this shipped to a friends in the states so i didn&#x27;t actually see it till last night.  Shipping WAS quick and the product was exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> It is grate product, and I will order it many times. I strongly recommend this product and more of the brand for you</li>
    <li> Love love love the scent; next time will buy larger size (this is a bit too small!!)</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and exactly what I ordered the packaging was a little basic however I expected a box to make sure the soap was protected</li>
    <li> Beautiful smell and stays with you throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day since it is his favorite soap.  He loves it and I love the scent it leaves on his body.</li>
    <li> I love this size soap.  You can use them for yourself and they smell awesome!  Or you can use them for guests bathroom.  I also like the small size so they don&#x27;t dissolve in the shower.  Seems like the bigger size soap gets wet and washes away.</li>
    <li> I Love this fragrance!  It&#x27;s clean and the scent lasts and lasts. It makes my whole bathroom smell amazing!  The best.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the smell of Jasmine, so I thought I would buy him some Jasmine-scented soap for a treat. I thought the price was kinda high, but I thought I would try it. (There&#x27;s not a lot of Jasmine scented products on the market.) Well, it&#x27;s not really worth it. The scent fades really quickly and soap doesn&#x27;t last that long. I love really nice bar soaps, and this one doesn&#x27;t measure up to the other choices out there. When I treat myself or someone I love again, I&#x27;m sticking to the Claus Porto brand or Aveda Refreshing Bar soap.</li>
    <li> SMELLS MARVELOUS.  I&#x27;m using the soaps as sachet in lingerie drawer.  When they dry out a little, I&#x27;ll use it to wash my hands.</li>
    <li> Love these soaps--these are the real deal--long lasting and wonderful scent--the soaps waiting in the wings are in my lingerie drawer multitasking before the main event (my shower!).</li>
    <li> First psed at Ritz Carltun in Jupiter Florida .  Loved it, so now I must have it at home.  Takes me back to a great trip every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Some of the best-smelling soap I have ever smelled. The soap is very foamy and does not dry out skin too much. Plus it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I love these small, hotel-size BVLGARI soaps because of their delicate scent (White Tea). They are perfect for personal use and for guests as they are just the right size and presented in a nicely wrapped thin paper with their signature lettering. I have been buying them for years but they do run out of stock often!</li>
    <li> I found these Bulgari soaps used in a hotel and ordered some for home.  The scent is great and I would definitely order them again.</li>
    <li> what a very nice product ,,, i ordered it a year ago from another supplier but didn&#x27;t receive it so i decided to buy it again as i couldn&#x27;t forget that lovely beautiful smell and finally i got ... thank u so much , appreciated xxx</li>
    <li> totally satisfied with this soap. leaves a  good smell on you after the bath. Not a moisturizing soap. leaves a white layer giving ur skin a fairer complexion for a while. More than anything, this smell succumbs you.</li>
    <li> These were a gift and the recipient loved them. Having said that, I think the seller needs to be a little bit more explicit that these don&#x27;t come boxed. I received mine in a little plastic Ziploc baggie. It doesn&#x27;t matter I suppose, if this is for personal use, but if you are buying them for a gift, caveat emptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the soaps themselves: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: 3 stars for not being clear in the listing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the scent of this soap. Its really fresh and the smell lasts with you all day. Lovely!</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance.It would have been niceer if it had been packaged in a box.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and the smell stays . My body doesn&#x27;t touch any other soap but this one. I am very spoiled!! &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this soap.  Leaves you clean with no waxy film on your skin.</li>
    <li> Great smelling soap but as others have said, each soap is too small.  I would only buy it next time if larger soaps are available.</li>
    <li> great smell love the way it cleans wish the bars were bigger for the money but over all really love the smell</li>
    <li> This soap has that wonderful Bvlgari scent and is authentic.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this set of soaps.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and the soaps are very hard to find unless you hoard them from the Ritz Carlton.</li>
    <li> Great bargain for a wonderful scent.  Are their body lotions in a similar trial size?</li>
    <li> love the soap, hate the price</li>
    <li> love the smell but it dries out my skin</li>
    <li> They small and not cheap, but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase with an excellent company. Product was ordered, received and used within 6 days. Love this soap which I received from Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas and since its a must in all of my bathrooms. Thank you for a splendid product at such a good price!</li>
    <li> Very good quality soap.  Smells fantastic.  A great soap value for the price. Everything was shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
    <li> A tiempo y sin problemas llegó el producto y al y como lo había pedido.Buen vendedor. Gracias por todo.&lt;br /&gt;Saludos.</li>
    <li> Have loved this soap ever since staying at the Ritz in Atlanta several years ago.  Still love it!  These soaps are a great size to include in gifts.</li>
    <li> The Ritz supplied this soap during my last stay. It smells great and moisturizes. Did I mention that it has a great fragrance?</li>
    <li> A few years ago I went on a cruse with Silver Seas and they had BUlgari toiletries.  On return I search for these and could not find them at any price, luckily I found them on Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big guy and one wouldn&#x27;t think that I would use such toiletries, but I love them, thak you Amazon for providing this extravagance for me!</li>
    <li> My order of Bulgari soap arrived promptly, and in good condition. It has a strong pleasant scent which my wife likes; and that makes it all worthwhile.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, and it was exactly what I was looking for. It came quickly, too. The scent is so light and french. I&#x27;m awful at describing scents, but this is the soap they have in a very expensive hotel.</li>
    <li> The soap makes me smile everytime  I wash my hand .Smells of jasmin took my breath away.What a wonderful feeling! Small soap can change aroma to your spirt.Thanks</li>
    <li> My mother loved these.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product and delivery. I would gladly order again. The soap is like aroma therapy.  I use them in my clothing drawers until I need a bar in the shower. They make my whole house smell lovely</li>
    <li> Creamy, gentle, clasic fragrance. It&#x27;s pricey but worth it. It leaves my skin fragrant and soft for a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly.  This soap smells good and makes you feel better for the whole day.  Wish it was little bit bigger.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than Bvlgari ... made famous in the Janet Evanovich books about Stephanie Plum.  If you have read the books then you know this is what gives Ranger his very high sex appeal.  wooo hoooo  Well, I can tell you it works.  It&#x27;s simple and it&#x27;s wonderful.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.  :))</li>
    <li> Best smelling soap ever.</li>
    <li> We used this soap while staying in a five star hotel.  Has a wonderful clean, scent.  Not a heavy perfumed scent.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quality guest soap that had to be no bigger than 2-2 1/2 inches in circumference.  These Bulgari soaps are perfect.  This certainly is not a skimpy item and the soft scent is lovely but not so strong as to be overpowering.  This may not be the least expensive soap, but it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> during the cruise I used Bulgari products exclusively.  I could tell the high quality of the soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotions.  it&#x27;s a treat that I can now use them at home.  I will put them on my wish list for birthday and Christmas</li>
    <li> Bvlgari Savon Soap is delightful. Fresh, different, and always pleasant, I would recommend this product for those who want a little something different. No run of the mill soap here.</li>
    <li> Great everything I expected</li>
    <li> I love the Bulgari soap smell, but was diappointed in the size of the bar.  Looked like the size I receive when I book a room in a hotel.</li>
    <li> This soap smells so very elegant.  It is subtle and light; I guess I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t have the overpoweringly perfumed scent of trying too hard to smell nice. I debated about buying the soap because at 1.76 ounces it is rather small for the price, even though it comes 6 to a pack.  Once I removed this order from the box of stuff I bought through Amazon and got a whiff of the scent I was glad I splurged on this soap for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already started using one, but guess I&#x27;ll save the rest for semi-special occasions (cheapskate that I am).  Even when I put it away, my hands still smelled great from just handling the bag of 6 soaps.  It was great taking a bath with it also, of course.  The scent of this soap coming off my skin left me feeling feminine and self confident.</li>
    <li> Ever since I used this soap at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Puerto Rico, I haved loved it!!! It&#x27;s the only soap I &amp; my family use. I have given it as a gift too.</li>
    <li> I experienced this soap while staying at the Ritz- Carlton in Ft. Lauderdale. It has a great seaside smell to it and lasts a long time. Loved it!</li>
    <li> First I was a bit skeptical about this blind purchase since I take my bath products very seriously, but after receiving the item, I was immediately impress with the fragrance out of the box, the size of the soaps took me by surprise, but they last a pretty decend amount of time of everyday shower use and fragrance lingers around the bathroom hours after you shower, my wifey loves the clean, fresh smell on me, it&#x27;s a winner man, but it !</li>
    <li> Birthday gift for my daugther - keeps the soaps in her dresser drawers for the lovely hint of fragrance!</li>
