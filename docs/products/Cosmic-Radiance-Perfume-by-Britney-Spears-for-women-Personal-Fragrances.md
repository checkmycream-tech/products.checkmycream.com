      <li>i still love it</li>
      <li>I always love all of Brittney Spears perfumes.  </li>
      <li>Love it, love it.</li>
      <li>This is her favorite Britney Spears perfume .</li>
      <li>Not my favorite.</li>
      <li>Cosmic radiance opens with more citrusy fruits with mandarin, lychee and pear.</li>
      <li>I get mostly the lychee and mandarin on my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>so I was glad</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet and sexy just like BritBrit!</li>
      <li>Definitely a good choice if you want a light sweet fruity scent.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to any Britney fan or really anyone who loves a nice fragrance!</li>
      <li>Buy and enjoy:)</li>
      <li>Overall its a good perfume!</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;ve never been a huge Britney fan, I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of most of her perfumes.</li>
      <li>It is strong and wearable.</li>
      <li>If I were to be able to change one thing, I would add a little more fruit and vanilla, but it smells really good.</li>
      <li>I bought it originally just for the bottle</li>
      <li>This is a nice perfume, but it doesn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
      <li>Sweet.</li>
      <li>And I also received the item very fast!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend In Control Curious, Circus Fantasy, Fantasy Anniversary Edition, or Believe if you are looking for a good Britney Spears fragrance, as those are my favorite</li>
      <li>That makes her smile.  </li>
      <li>I have spent 4 times as much on perfume that did not even smell near as good.!!</li>
      <li>The seller shipped right away so that was a plus.</li>
      <li>Regular Radiance, in my opinion, is better than this one.</li>
      <li>When buying britney purfume make sure its not the same purfume just in diffrent bottles .</li>
      <li>a girl will say \\&quot;Something smells really good.\\&quot; , and they smell me and say \\&quot;OMG, it&#x27;s you!\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Thanks again Amazon.......</li>
      <li>This perfume is very floral.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so responsible.</li>
      <li>Compared to all of her other perfumes, it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
      <li>everybody says that the fragance is the same as the original raddiance</li>
      <li>a huge britney spears fan and some of her purfumes like fantasy that have sequals to them that smell the same just diffrent bottling is a let down BUT cosmic radiance smell way diffrent from the original radiance .</li>
      <li>The base is my favorite part of the whole fragrance, it leaves a very sweet candy like vanilla-y note on the skin and really just warms up the whole fragrance.</li>
      <li>and wow I took it out of the box</li>
      <li>After putting this perfume on, the smell is completely gone with in 20 mins.</li>
      <li>It has the same white florals from the original Radiance, but the top and base are very different.</li>

<li> The bottle was so much bigger than I expected.</li>
<li> (It lasts a very long time)</li>
<li> All the notes blend together so well with this, I can smell the top, heart and the base right from the initial spritz and it stays the way until 5-6 hrs later when I&#x27;m just left with that soft creamy vanilla base.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s about 2-3 inches tall by one inch wide.</li>
<li> I honestly, religiously wear this fragrance everyday.</li>
<li> but I got sick of it quick.  </li>
<li> The base has sweet vanilla, amber and sandalwood.</li>
<li> I have not found a version that I do not love.  </li>
<li> I was like holy cow!!!</li>
<li> and I found it to be too expensive for what it is.</li>
<li> Also, I think this bottle is really, really ugly.</li>

    <li> This is the best perfume ever!!!! It smells freaking fantastic and it shipped with in three days!!! The bottle is huge!!! 3.3 oz and wow I took it out of the box I was like holy cow!!!</li>
    <li> After putting this perfume on, the smell is completely gone with in 20 mins. I have reapplied over and over, and keep getting the same result!</li>
    <li> I honestly, religiously wear this fragrance everyday. It is fruity and flowery and just so good! Sometimes I&#x27;ll walk in class and a girl will say \\&quot;Something smells really good.\\&quot; , and they smell me and say \\&quot;OMG, it&#x27;s you!\\&quot;. People noice all the time that I smell fab. It&#x27;s the best out of all of her perfumes, in my opinion, and the bottle and box are so cute! Buy and enjoy:)</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, worth the price, arrived in a timely manner as well</li>
    <li> This was a gift my son bought his girlfriend for Christmas. He couldnt find it anywhere where we are located so I was glad (as was he) that we found it on Amazon. The seller shipped right away so that was a plus. Personally I did not care for the smell of this perfume and I found it to be too expensive for what it is. But with all that said I didnt buy it nor was it a gift for me so I guess all that matters is my son didnt seem to mind the price and his girlfriend seemed to like the smell....so all is good.</li>
    <li> I actually got this perfume for a friend for her birthday. I had never smelled this perfume before and bought it on a wim. It smells amazing! (Even though i am not the one wearing it) The bottle is huge and my friend loved it. She&#x27;s stopped wearing her juicy couture and this is all i smell on her all the time! (It lasts a very long time) Its very cheap for the size. Buy this perfume you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Nice scent but I got sick of it quick.  Sweet. If you like smelling like candy, get this.</li>
    <li> i ordered this, and recieved it in two days! Amazing! still waiting for something else i ordered the same day! great service!!</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve never been a huge Britney fan, I&#x27;ve always been a huge fan of most of her perfumes. Cosmic radiance is no exception. It has the same white florals from the original Radiance, but the top and base are very different. Cosmic radiance opens with more citrusy fruits with mandarin, lychee and pear. I get mostly the lychee and mandarin on my skin. The base has sweet vanilla, amber and sandalwood. The base is my favorite part of the whole fragrance, it leaves a very sweet candy like vanilla-y note on the skin and really just warms up the whole fragrance. All the notes blend together so well with this, I can smell the top, heart and the base right from the initial spritz and it stays the way until 5-6 hrs later when I&#x27;m just left with that soft creamy vanilla base. Without a doubt, Cosmic Radiance is my favorite of her collection.</li>
    <li> Im a huge britney spears fan and some of her purfumes like fantasy that have sequals to them that smell the same just diffrent bottling is a let down BUT cosmic radiance smell way diffrent from the original radiance . I bought this for my best friend she loves it . When buying britney purfume make sure its not the same purfume just in diffrent bottles .</li>
    <li> Amazing product , smells absolutely amazing ~ A great buy for its price!</li>
    <li> This is her favorite Britney Spears perfume . Although she loves them all. I like the way they smell myself. I have spent 4 times as much on perfume that did not even smell near as good.!! People tell her often how good  she smells. That makes her smile.  Which is very good for me. Happy wife happy life....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thanks again Amazon.......</li>

    <li> I always love all of Brittney Spears perfumes.  I have not found a version that I do not love.  I think I might have tried them all.  Love it, love it.</li>
    <li> Definitely a good choice if you want a light sweet fruity scent. Not my favorite. I highly recommend In Control Curious, Circus Fantasy, Fantasy Anniversary Edition, or Believe if you are looking for a good Britney Spears fragrance, as those are my favorite</li>
    <li> everybody says that the fragance is the same as the original raddiance but i dint care i still love it</li>

    <li> I buy all of Britney Spears fragrances for my daughter she loves them, around birthday time Christmas whatever or just because I Love her.</li>
    <li> This is a nice perfume, but it doesn&#x27;t wow me. I would have prefer something like Fantasy by Britney Spears. Overall, i like this perfume, but i don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hooked enough to buy again. It is strong and wearable. Overall its a good perfume!</li>
    <li> I have all of the Britney Spears Fragrances and love them all! Cosmic radiance is one of my favorites though. The smell is amazing! And I also received the item very fast! I would recommend this to any Britney fan or really anyone who loves a nice fragrance!</li>
    <li> This perfume is very floral. There is some fruit essence and it smells very sexy. The bottle was so much bigger than I expected. It&#x27;s about 2-3 inches tall by one inch wide. I love it. It&#x27;s a beautiful, strong, and confident scent. If I were to be able to change one thing, I would add a little more fruit and vanilla, but it smells really good.

    <li> Excellent product, prefume my wife loved it, by the way, you are using it, good quality, packaging was as expected, and most importantly came just in time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Compared to all of her other perfumes, it&#x27;s not my favorite. Regular Radiance, in my opinion, is better than this one. Also, I think this bottle is really, really ugly. I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking.</li>
