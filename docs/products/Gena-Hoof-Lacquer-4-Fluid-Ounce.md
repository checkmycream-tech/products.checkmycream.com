      <li>Great product for strengthening splitting fingernails, not just horse&#x27;s hoofs.</li>
      <li>It was great.</li>
      <li>&gt; Ideally created for show horses, it has been &#x27;adopted&#x27; by humans and we love it!  </li>
      <li>Healthy Hoof laquer is a great product and makes your nails grow.  </li>
      <li>I love this Hoof Lacquer!</li>
      <li>This is far and away the best and listed at a fair price.</li>
      <li>Give a nice glossy shine that drys very quickly!</li>
      <li>I do my own manicures at home, and with this product I can do my nails (using some Essie or OPI strength product and color) and then use 1-2 coats of the Hoof Lacquer as the top coats.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and the staying power is amazing.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I wrap many fishing jigs with thread and protect it with this product.  </li>
      <li>it is the best top coat, making your pedicure shine and last, chip-free for WEEKS!  </li>
      <li>Everyone needs to know about this fabulous product!</li>
      <li>I love the product</li>
      <li>One of my favorite top coats</li>
      <li>My friend told me about this product, love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using healthy hoof nail lacquer for many years.</li>
      <li>Thank you!  :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great quality product and priced better than many of the professional top coats.</li>
      <li>This works pretty good.</li>
      <li>It is strong; it&#x27;s made for horse hooves.</li>
      <li>My manicure last a full week, and looks great without chipping or breaking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years,  first introduced during cosmetology school while searching for a fast-dry topcoat.  </li>
      <li>When I saw the reviews I couldn&#x27;t believe they could be true.</li>
      <li>It levels itself out and dries surprisingly quickly.  </li>
      <li>this was a Christmas present that my oldest daughter asked for and she was pleased that I was able to get it for her.</li>
      <li>The price is very reasonable, so I decided to order it and give it a try.</li>
      <li>I had it first applied in a Spa in Maryland for all my nails.</li>
      <li>Not sure which one, but I can not have nails nicely finished without this product!    </li>
      <li>The first bottle I received had a cracked lid, so I asked for a replacement.</li>
      <li>I purchased this in a store first on the recommendation of a diabetic educator to help strengthen my nails.  </li>
      <li>Since then I simply don&#x27;t buy anything else for top coat.</li>
      <li>Am now onto buying the large side.  </li>
      <li>It certainly works for Me.</li>
      <li>Not sure what the great reviews are about, I feel like I just baught the same cheap clear polish I could have bought at a dollar store.</li>
      <li>some Nail places just simply don&#x27;t know the item exists, or actually do not want you good to go for such a nice long time.</li>
      <li>price is so reasonable, try it-you have nothing to lose!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Be sure to save a nearly empty nail polish bottle to reflll as this doesn&#x27;t have an application brush and is too large for normal polishing use.</li>
      <li>Works better than any other product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I was expecting better when I saw the previous ratings.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It looks like clear nail polish, but comes out of the bottle and applies much thicker.  </li>
      <li>Second when I got in the shower it peeled right off</li>
      <li>First off the bigger size doesn&#x27;t come with a brush.</li>
      <li>so you gotta pour this into a smaller, empty bottle with a brush or buy a capped brush that would fit this bottle.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to see it in 4 oz.</li>
      <li>I got this for my sister because she goes through one of the small bottles pretty fast.</li>
      <li>I use it on bare nails as I do a lot of crafts.</li>
      <li>After your initial manicure apply one wk later to keep your nails looking newly done.</li>
      <li>Is strong, hard and lasts a very long time.</li>
      <li>Its average really...</li>

    <li> Give a nice glossy shine that drys very quickly! One of my favorite top coats</li>
    <li> It seems to me there is a reason nail salons do not use this product...it is the best top coat, making your pedicure shine and last, chip-free for WEEKS!  Get your nails done, then come home and apply Hoof Laquer! Whenever I tell my friends about it, they say \\&quot;what&#x27;s that?\\&quot;  Everyone needs to know about this fabulous product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using healthy hoof nail lacquer for many years. It goes on smooth and the staying power is amazing. After your initial manicure apply one wk later to keep your nails looking newly done.</li>
    <li> i HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR AWHILE.  IT HAS IMPROVED MY SPLIT NAILS.  IN MY CASE, THAT HAPPENED IN QUITE A SHORT TIME.  I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I love this, My nails are like onions as they peel and this WILL STAY ON!!!</li>
    <li> Healthy Hoof laquer is a great product and makes your nails grow.  I&#x27;ve used this for years and had no issues with the seller \\&quot;Nail Essential\\&quot;.  Just wanted to let you know that with the bigger  4oz bottle there is no brush under the cap so you gotta pour this into a smaller, empty bottle with a brush or buy a capped brush that would fit this bottle.  (if you can find one)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail tech for 27 years and I&#x27;ve been using this on and off for a long time. I was surprised to see it in 4 oz. It&#x27;s a great quality product and priced better than many of the professional top coats. Works well to preserve your airbrushing and nail art. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this was a Christmas present that my oldest daughter asked for and she was pleased that I was able to get it for her.</li>
    <li> Best Ever nail polish. Strengthens and restores health to your nails! Is strong, hard and lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> This lacquer is excellent. I had it first applied in a Spa in Maryland for all my nails. It was so shiny and kept my nails beautiful for over 14 days! Unheard! Since then I simply don&#x27;t buy anything else for top coat. I thing some Nail places just simply don&#x27;t know the item exists, or actually do not want you good to go for such a nice long time. Not sure which one, but I can not have nails nicely finished without this product!    Thank you!  :)</li>
    <li> I put this on my nails last night and this morning it all peeled off already. Not sure what the great reviews are about, I feel like I just baught the same cheap clear polish I could have bought at a dollar store.</li>
    <li> It certainly works for Me. I use it on small Hard Wood projects, rings,etc. Drys clear and hard, and goes a long way. Lid has a built in brush.  Yup.!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of this product for over 10 years.  It looks like clear nail polish, but comes out of the bottle and applies much thicker.  It levels itself out and dries surprisingly quickly.  When used as a top coat, your nail polish wears like that fancy, expensive gel product. I also just wear it with no color.  It is strong; it&#x27;s made for horse hooves.</li>
    <li> I love this Hoof Lacquer! I have the world&#x27;s thinnest nails, always peeling and chipping. When I saw the reviews I couldn&#x27;t believe they could be true. The price is very reasonable, so I decided to order it and give it a try. The first bottle I received had a cracked lid, so I asked for a replacement. As the seller didn&#x27;t have a replacement lid, they sent a replacement product (they gave me a choice of that or a discount). I do my own manicures at home, and with this product I can do my nails (using some Essie or OPI strength product and color) and then use 1-2 coats of the Hoof Lacquer as the top coats. My manicure last a full week, and looks great without chipping or breaking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to save a nearly empty nail polish bottle to reflll as this doesn&#x27;t have an application brush and is too large for normal polishing use.</li>
    <li> I wrap many fishing jigs with thread and protect it with this product.  Have used others over the years.  This is far and away the best and listed at a fair price.</li>
    <li> I wanted a nail harder to strengthen my weak nails.  First off the bigger size doesn&#x27;t come with a brush. Second when I got in the shower it peeled right off</li>
    <li> Great product for strengthening splitting fingernails, not just horse&#x27;s hoofs. An applicator would be helpful and should be included in each bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years,  first introduced during cosmetology school while searching for a fast-dry topcoat.  This is the FASTEST DRYING nail product on the planet.&lt;br /&gt; Ideally created for show horses, it has been &#x27;adopted&#x27; by humans and we love it!  When used alone, the product will peel off at tips (impact areas) of nails after a couple of days, but use over polish and it is ON TO STAY!  I adore this product over my french manicured toes..it seriously lasts for months,  if I choose to leave that long.&lt;br /&gt;The only product that I feel actually promotes my nail growth!&lt;br /&gt;The price is so reasonable, try it-you have nothing to lose!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Its average really...I didn&#x27;t find any changes in my nails from using this for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It also needs to be taken off and reapplied every couple days as it wears thin then off.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this product, love it.  Am now onto buying the large side.  Have told a lot of people about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this in a store first on the recommendation of a diabetic educator to help strengthen my nails.  It is much less expensive here.  The smaller bottles seemed to evaporate, this one does not.  If you have splitting or weak nails, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I love the product BUT, there was no brush to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Why Not?&lt;br /&gt;And no offer of a brush.</li>
    <li> This works pretty good.</li>
    <li> I put on a layer and in about an hour, I had my hands in water and it began to peel. I was expecting better when I saw the previous ratings. Bummer!</li>
    <li> It was great. Works better than any other product I have ever used. I use it on bare nails as I do a lot of crafts.</li>
    <li> This is half the price of what you find in the store. I got this for my sister because she goes through one of the small bottles pretty fast. She basically refills the smaller bottles as needed. Love this stuff.</li>
