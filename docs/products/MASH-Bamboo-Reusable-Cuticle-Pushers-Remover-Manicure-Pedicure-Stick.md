### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I picked these up for my fiancee, and she says that they are not the best, but they get the job done.</li>
      <li>Great purchase!</li>
      <li>They are the perfect tool for me to use when I pamper myself with a manicure.  </li>
      <li>I used Amazon.com because I can&#x27;t get them sent via Amazon.co.uk and find this a wonderful way of ordering stuff.</li>
      <li>The seller was great too!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
      <li>Excellent quality and a great value.</li>
      <li>, I think it was a great product.</li>
      <li>This is a good product for a good price.</li>
      <li>I ordered these from amazon thinking they might be a superior product and</li>
      <li>Good quality ones.</li>
      <li>So my girlfriend ordered these and loved them.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re good for cleaning up around your nails when using polish, also.  </li>
      <li>The price was good and the product works, what more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>and she Skyped me to say they had arrived and was sure I would be very pleased with purchase.  </li>
      <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
      <li>- thank you, Amazon!  :)</li>
      <li>Again, since there is no online measurement for this product I should have known better.</li>
      <li>I like that they seem more durable than the cheapie ones</li>
      <li>Plus, they&#x27;re cheap!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they will be fine.  </li>
      <li>They are very clean and smooth looking.  </li>
      <li>and I think would easily break.  </li>
      <li>Certainly the delivery was VERY quick!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what is supposed to be so special about these.  </li>
      <li>From the online description you would think they were special</li>
      <li>These are nothing special.</li>
      <li>and they are useful.</li>
      <li>On a deployment to a middle eastern country I used these to get important information from some...not so friendly people.</li>
      <li>I liked it, but the pointed tip wore down pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>They are exactly what you would expect.</li>
      <li>I think I prefer the oval end on a regular stick better, but this can be filed (or whittled) into that shape.    </li>
      <li>They look like regular wooden manicure sticks to me... and, quite honestly, so does the picture - I can see wood grain when I zoom in for a closer look!    </li>
      <li>I was looking for a small dollar item to qualify for free shipping on the rest of my MASH nail purchase and am so glad I chose these.  </li>
      <li>I work at a drug store and could easily purchase similar</li>
      <li>I use these to get rid of those little misses when I am painting my own nails.  </li>
      <li>And delivered straight to your door.</li>
      <li>I used these to remove shellac nail polish and they worked really well.  </li>
      <li>Very durable product...</li>
      <li>and I now know  better quality sticks for much less money.  </li>
      <li>But the price is steep for what they are, which is disappointing, and the product should be represented more accurately.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to repurchase nearly as often.</li>
      <li>Works exactly like you&#x27;d expect it to without any catches or rough patches.</li>
      <li>I soak the flat end into the remover and then can remove those little mistakes so easily.</li>
      <li>The item description made such a big deal about how these were high quality bamboo sticks.  </li>
      <li>Turns out sensitive cuticles are the key to a mans brain.</li>
      <li>These cuticle pushers do what they should, they aren&#x27;t any better or worse than any of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>While this set of cuticle pushers were not worth the trouble to return, I most likely should have on principle alone.  </li>
      <li>Nothing was broken, arrived on time, product as described, works perfectly fine.</li>

<li> Other than that</li>
<li> One end is sharply pointed and the other is blunt cut.  </li>
<li> both prices are outrageous for a simple manicure stick.  </li>
<li> They are very thin around</li>

    <li> I picked these up for my fiancee, and she says that they are not the best, but they get the job done.</li>
    <li> Yeah...these aren&#x27;t bamboo. They look identical to the wooden orange sticks I bought at a big box store for 99 cents, and are about as re-usable and trimmable as any other you might buy. If you are looking for plain old wood manicure sticks, go for it. But the price is steep for what they are, which is disappointing, and the product should be represented more accurately. These are nothing special.</li>
    <li> I got these for my girlfriend for christmas and she likes them and they are useful. can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The item description made such a big deal about how these were high quality bamboo sticks.  They look like regular wooden manicure sticks to me... and, quite honestly, so does the picture - I can see wood grain when I zoom in for a closer look!    All the manicure sticks were the same color - wood colored.  They were a little longer, but not thicker than the ones I normally get.  I think I prefer the oval end on a regular stick better, but this can be filed (or whittled) into that shape.    I don&#x27;t know what is supposed to be so special about these.  I did like having them delivered to my door - thank you, Amazon!  :)</li>
    <li> Very durable product...especially since it&#x27;s reusable. They do the job and will last a long time. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! The seller was great too!!</li>
    <li> Like I said, they&#x27;re orange sticks. Good quality ones. But... are there that many bad ones? &#x3D;P They&#x27;re durable and reusable, so I like &#x27;em. Plus, they&#x27;re cheap! And delivered straight to your door. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for a good price. Works exactly like you&#x27;d expect it to without any catches or rough patches. I like that they seem more durable than the cheapie ones so you don&#x27;t have to repurchase nearly as often.</li>
    <li> These are basic bamboo cuticule pushers--they works as you would expect.  They&#x27;re good for cleaning up around your nails when using polish, also.  Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to be sent to my daughter in America and she Skyped me to say they had arrived and was sure I would be very pleased with purchase.  I used Amazon.com because I can&#x27;t get them sent via Amazon.co.uk and find this a wonderful way of ordering stuff. So although I haven&#x27;t actually got them yet (coming via a friend visiting UK later this month) I&#x27;m sure they will be fine.  Certainly the delivery was VERY quick!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find them anywhere but online.  I use these to get rid of those little misses when I am painting my own nails.  I soak the flat end into the remover and then can remove those little mistakes so easily.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but the pointed tip wore down pretty quickly.  Other than that, I think it was a great product.</li>
    <li> Packaging although somewhat flimsy was about all you can expect at this price point. Nothing was broken, arrived on time, product as described, works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> So my girlfriend ordered these and loved them. They worked for whatever she uses them for. I however saw another use for them. On a deployment to a middle eastern country I used these to get important information from some...not so friendly people. Turns out sensitive cuticles are the key to a mans brain.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small dollar item to qualify for free shipping on the rest of my MASH nail purchase and am so glad I chose these.  They are the perfect tool for me to use when I pamper myself with a manicure.  Excellent quality and a great value.</li>
    <li> These cuticle pushers do what they should, they aren&#x27;t any better or worse than any of the others I&#x27;ve used. The price was good and the product works, what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> While this set of cuticle pushers were not worth the trouble to return, I most likely should have on principle alone.  They are very thin around and I think would easily break.  They are very clean and smooth looking.  One end is sharply pointed and the other is blunt cut.  I work at a drug store and could easily purchase similar and I now know  better quality sticks for much less money.  I ordered these from amazon thinking they might be a superior product and since it does say \\&quot;reusable\\&quot; I thought they would last. From the online description you would think they were special but I didn&#x27;t find them so. They are an add on item for $3.99 but are regular price of $9.99 both prices are outrageous for a simple manicure stick.  Again, since there is no online measurement for this product I should have known better.</li>
    <li> I used these to remove shellac nail polish and they worked really well.  They are exactly what you would expect.</li>
