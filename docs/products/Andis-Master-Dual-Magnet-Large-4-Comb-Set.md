      <li>easy to wash them.</li>

      <li>Holds tight and fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>The magnets make for easy clean up and storage.</li>
      <li>since as I said, it is flush with the bottom edge of the blade and therefore cannot \\&quot;grasp\\&quot; the bottom edge of the blade, to keep the comb in place securely).  </li>
      <li>But I have searched for combs that do fit this unit and I cannot find them on this site or others.  </li>
      <li>Great update to a basic.</li>
      <li>They are really cool and don&#x27;t get lost as easily.</li>
      <li>and I love the fact they fit on both my Oster fast feeds and Andis masters!</li>
      <li>Love them I am a barber I don&#x27;t use guards much I use blades</li>
      <li>Not as good as the old first generation nano guards in my opinion</li>
      <li>They fit my Oster Fast Feed perfectly and I decided to buy them because the original black plastic attachments that come with the fast feed kept breaking.</li>
      <li>They are super durable</li>
      <li>I have to go over my husband head more times than normal to ensure an even cut.</li>
      <li>I purchased both the large and small guide combs, and they are the best combs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Very convenient to easily take on and off.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fun to do new design and get creative with this comb.</li>
      <li>I hope you enjoy them as much as I do now.</li>
      <li>but I bought these for kids and that won&#x27;t come off worth the price</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase this combs because I just recently started to cut my own hair</li>
      <li>the guard won&#x27;t go anywhere, worth the money</li>
      <li>It would be fun</li>
      <li>The purple color is really fun.</li>
      <li>Product came quickly and it was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>RIGHT</li>
      <li>They are very large ...</li>
      <li>I am surprised how strong these magnets are.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t get to them very much.</li>
      <li>(Again, make sure that the hole you drill is close to the edge so that the washer you install will extend beyond the comb enough to grasp the bottom of the blade on the clipper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are so much better than the regular combs.</li>
      <li>Make sure the hole is close enough to the edge, near where the clipper blade will go, so that a large washer which you will install, will keep the edge of the clipper blade securely in place in the comb.  </li>
      <li>i purchased the small set and use them on my oster fat feeds and they fit great... sturdy plastic and they wont slide off like the standard fast feed guards</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s solid as the rock of Gibraltar, yet easy to take off when you want to change.</li>
      <li>cause these are the large set.</li>
      <li>This part is supposed to fit just outside of the blade edge</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fast feeds and a masters owner.</li>
      <li>I am using with oster fast feed clipper.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They really work.</li>
      <li>straight to 1/4</li>
      <li>These are a must need for andis master or oster fast feeds they don&#x27;t bite the blade when the guard is on.</li>
      <li>I received my order before the scheduled date, that&#x27;s why I love shopping with amazon, never has had let me down with services.</li>
      <li>but I will need to purchase a shorter set to trim my dogs hair which I like super short.  </li>
      <li>Just spend a little more to get these.</li>
      <li>I took off a star because the cut is not as precise as other attachments I have used.</li>
      <li>Fits easily and hold tight with the magnets.</li>
      <li>The first is to strip the tiny plastic lip on the edges of these combs that&lt;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to cutting my own hair, and these guides have helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>They are magnetic so they don&#x27;t pop off like the black cheap ones.</li>
      <li>These work great for cutting my son&#x27;s hair that we keep longer than the ones that came with the clippers.</li>
      <li>So maybe the 3 stars is because Andis has not made it clear which combs (if any) will work.  </li>
      <li>thanks to Andis and amazon for making it possible...</li>
      <li>I was recommended these by a barber that I admire and without a doubt recommend them to anyone who is looking for a sturdy guard that will give them professional results.</li>
      <li>You are now ready to do the same on the bottom edge of the comb (</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked perfectly on Oster Fast Feed 76023-510. They are easy to put on and take off and are held securely in place with the magnets. I use these for personal hair trimming.</li>
    <li> I bought these as an upgrade to the guards that come with the andis master. They work perfectly. The only downside is they do of course clamp on to anything metallic that comes within range. That includes barber capes so you have to be careful when cutting. And they can be a little annoying when not in use which is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought both sets and other than including a 1/32 guard these are the only guards you&#x27;ll ever need with a master.</li>
    <li> Great clips that stay on and I love the fact they fit on both my Oster fast feeds and Andis masters!</li>
    <li> Fites my Andies clippers perfct ,just grate!!</li>
    <li> They work great with Andis MC-2.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;They work great, strong magnetic bond. The plastic used to create the clipper seems a little flimsy &amp; wish it was a bit thicker. Otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> I have the small attachments and needed the larger ones. The attachments stay on great. You will never have to worry about them falling off.</li>
    <li> I am surprised how strong these magnets are. They really do not budge! They fit my Oster Fast Feed perfectly and I decided to buy them because the original black plastic attachments that come with the fast feed kept breaking. Specifically, the little edge grippers kept breaking off so I wanted attachments that did need to grip onto the sides.  This comb set is perfect because they connect with magnets and are free of the side grips.  This set of combs are numbers 5-8 which work well on my husbands hair but I will need to purchase a shorter set to trim my dogs hair which I like super short.  I took off a star because the cut is not as precise as other attachments I have used. I have to go over my husband head more times than normal to ensure an even cut.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and it was exactly what I was expecting. These work great for cutting my son&#x27;s hair that we keep longer than the ones that came with the clippers.</li>
    <li> Not what I wanted but well made. They are very large ... not sure why they made them so long, but I&#x27;m not a barber so perhaps that&#x27;s helpful when clipping someones hair.</li>
    <li> I loved this guards, they are easy to use and secure. easy to wash them. I just don&#x27;t like the colors but they will do the job</li>
    <li> these are a must have for anybody who cuts hair for a living or just a DIY person&lt;br /&gt;the magnet holds on to the clipper really well without slipping or any sort</li>
    <li> they totally stick to everything, it&#x27;s annoying to put them on, went back to regular.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these guards! I have 0-8 size. The magnets make for easy clean up and storage. The purple color is really fun. They are super durable I use mine almost every day. I have the Oster masters and they fit perfectly on my clippers. I was recommended these by a barber that I admire and without a doubt recommend them to anyone who is looking for a sturdy guard that will give them professional results. The only bad thing I can say about these guards is that you can&#x27;t find them in a 0-8 set you have to buy them in two sets, but they only cost about 15 bucks so its worth it. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do now.</li>
    <li> Top of the line quality for barbers.</li>
    <li> I purchased both the large and small guide combs, and they are the best combs I&#x27;ve used. The magnets attach easily but don&#x27;t budge while in use. The plastic is solid and I suspect that these will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great professional product! Great quality and shipped fast!</li>
    <li> These are a must need for andis master or oster fast feeds they don&#x27;t bite the blade when the guard is on. They are magnetic so they don&#x27;t pop off like the black cheap ones.</li>
    <li> I got these magnetic clipper guards about a month and a half already and I must say they are the best!!!! The magnet is very strong, keeping the guard secure and sturdy on the clipper!!! Also, they have numbers and measurements printed on them, for those barbers that are used to measurements such as 1/16, 1/8, 1/2, 3/8 etc, they are also numbered from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 etc for those who are used to numbers!! I can&#x27;t complain, and if you are looking to get a set of guards for your clippers because the old ones cracked by falling on the ground, I highly recommend these clipper guards, and they aren&#x27;t bad for what they are selling for here on Amazon.com!!! Get yours today!!!</li>
    <li> The best no need to review.. Magnets are very very strong and will hold with any thought!! and the pratice is like a hard rubber not the hard plastic like the red speedoguides.</li>
    <li> To be fair, the description for these combs do not say specifically that they are compatible with my Andis 63100 BGRv razor, using the #1 blade that came with this unit when I bought it on this site.  And so it might not be fair for me to give them 3 stars instead of 5.  But I have searched for combs that do fit this unit and I cannot find them on this site or others.  So maybe the 3 stars is because Andis has not made it clear which combs (if any) will work.  In any case, accept this as a warning that the combs are not \\&quot;universal\\&quot; (they do not fit my Wahl \\&quot;All-Pro\\&quot; clippers either, as the combs are slightly too large).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The problem I faced is that the outer dimensions of the combs appear to be exactly the same dimensions as the sides and bottom of the blade of my Andis clipper, when the cutting end of the clipper is inserted into the cutting edge part of the comb.  And you cannot really use these combs on this unit like this because the cutting edge will tend to slip slightly to one side or the other, causing part of the comb to fall into a cutting tooth on my clipper, or at least requiring a re-adjustment--too often to tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My solution has a few steps.  The first is to strip the tiny plastic lip on the edges of these combs that&lt;br /&gt;are meant to fit outside the corners of the blade near the cutting edge.  This part is supposed to fit just outside of the blade edge but as I said, the blade is exactly as wide as the entire comb and so the cutting edge will not fit inside these plastic lip edges on the combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Next, after you have trimmed this tiny plastic lip just described, you will need something on the outside edge of the comb to overlap the outside edge of the clipper blade, to hold it in place.  So get out the drill with an 1/8\\&quot; bit and drill a hole in the sides of the comb near where the cutting edge is inserted.  Make sure the hole is close enough to the edge, near where the clipper blade will go, so that a large washer which you will install, will keep the edge of the clipper blade securely in place in the comb.  (This becomes the new \\&quot;lip\\&quot; on the comb that grasps the edge of the clipper blade near the cutting edge, when inserted into the comb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now insert (and then \\&quot;pop\\&quot;) the 1/8\\&quot; rivet with big washer, into the hole you drilled into the sides of the comb.  You are now ready to do the same on the bottom edge of the comb (since as I said, it is flush with the bottom edge of the blade and therefore cannot \\&quot;grasp\\&quot; the bottom edge of the blade, to keep the comb in place securely).  But first, trim a very small amount of the plastic off of the bottom of the comb so that you will have a flush surface there to rivet a washer too.  (Again, make sure that the hole you drill is close to the edge so that the washer you install will extend beyond the comb enough to grasp the bottom of the blade on the clipper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Congratulations, you now have combs (at least one comb that is) that will stay put on your Andis blade.  And the strong magnets keep the blade in place well--now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  True, the combs are purple, with small metallic flakes, but I don&#x27;t care.  Plastic appears to be decent quality, flexible but rigid enough to pop an aluminum rivet.</li>
    <li> when you clip one of these onto the shaver (I&#x27;ve got an Oster) it&#x27;s solid as the rock of Gibraltar, yet easy to take off when you want to change. I&#x27;m new to cutting my own hair, and these guides have helped tremendously.</li>
    <li> I was looking for reliable good guards for my clippers. I&#x27;m a fast feeds and a masters owner. After getting the small set I just had to get the large ones to complete my set</li>
    <li> These are great, wont fall off.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and ready to snap on any hair clipper located in the shop yeah!</li>
    <li> They really work. My go to guards from now on!&lt;br /&gt;Every barber needs these guards you save time and money.</li>
    <li> These are good quality and I love the way they clip on but I find they leave some lines in the hair. I&#x27;ve gone back to using the combs that came with my clipper because they have finer tines.</li>
    <li> I just received this Andis large comb set , it is magnetic, which makes it perfect for any hair clipper that has metel teeth, which most clippers are. I am using with oster fast feed clipper. An awesome hair clippers too. I received my order before the scheduled date, that&#x27;s why I love shopping with amazon, never has had let me down with services. The magnetic combs are all easy to use, magnets are very strong and sturdy. I decided to purchase this combs because I just recently started to cut my own hair and it&#x27;s fun to do new design and get creative with this comb. You can use it any size or shape as you please. I have had bad barbers experience some Barbars are unfamiliar with my hair style and ruined my hair style in past -so I decided to cut my own hair. It is fun and precise to cut my own hair with this magnetic comb set. They are the best in the market, stop your search here and you will enjoy years to come. Don&#x27;t procrastinating and buy it already. You will be glad you did.. I am A happy customer, so thanks to Andis and amazon for making it possible... Excellent product, intelligent design, great for home Barbars. This product is a five star indeed. Enjoy everyone, happy shopping.</li>
    <li> Have never been happy with the original comb set that came from oster for my fast feed.  This set is far superior and has performed flawlessly. Holds tight and fits perfectly. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are so much better than the regular combs. Just spend a little more to get these. They are really cool and don&#x27;t get lost as easily. Magnets are super strong!</li>
    <li> We use these on the Amazon purchased Andis 63100 Variable Speed Hair Clipper Kit. The width is a little off but not enough to affect the cut. Very convenient to easily take on and off. Stays put as the magnets are very strong.</li>
    <li> Fits easily and hold tight with the magnets. Only challenge is keep the blades away from each other if you set them on the table... otherwise the magnets snap them together and you have to pry them apart. Only other thing is being such a shade of purple, it is hard to see the number blade I am using...but as I am new to clipper cutting, It is only a matter of time till I will be able to know which is which just by glancing at it.</li>
    <li> Love them I am a barber I don&#x27;t use guards much I use blades but I bought these for kids and that won&#x27;t come off worth the price</li>
    <li> Not as good as the old first generation nano guards in my opinion</li>
    <li> Strong magnets, just perfect! Don&#x27;t buy if you need smaller guards cause these are the large set. The smaller set offers #0-4.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a part time barber and this makes cutting efficient. They just snap on and off with minimal effort. Yee</li>
    <li> The information when purchasing item didn&#x27;t specify what size it would come in.The sizes are too big.So I had to re order a different size.</li>
    <li> Fits great, very sturdy strong magnet the guard won&#x27;t go anywhere, worth the money no complaints</li>
    <li> Works great, the product is described perfect along with the picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades wont work with a oster 76 but fits my Andis fade master</li>
    <li> Great update to a basic. They work well and hold on perfectly! It would be fun I they came in colors.</li>
    <li> Good but I don&#x27;t get to them very much. Your better off using the scissors but praying to use them a lot more</li>
    <li> I HAVE THE MAGNETICS 1-4 BUT I WAS DOING MOHAWKS ALOT SO I HAD TO ADD THE 5-8&lt;br /&gt;THEY DO THE JOB&lt;br /&gt;CLIP RIGHT AND DO NOT WEAR AS MUCH&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE NOT FOR BEARDS SO PLEASE DO NOT USE LOW RATE THEM BECAUSE THEY DID  NOT WORK ON YOUR BEARD</li>
    <li> i purchased the small set and use them on my oster fat feeds and they fit great... sturdy plastic and they wont slide off like the standard fast feed guards and you also get a 1/8 guard the standard fast feed guards go from the blending (1/16) straight to 1/4</li>
