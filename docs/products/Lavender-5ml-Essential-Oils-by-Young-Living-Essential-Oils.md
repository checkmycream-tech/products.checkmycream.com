<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My children love this oil as much as I do. We diffuse it often! Great product!</li>
    <li> I AM VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT.  WHEN I CANNOT SLEEP AND AM TOSSING AND TURNING I RUB JUST A DROP OF LAVENDER UNDER MY NOSE AND IN 15 MINUTUES... I AM ASLEEP... HAS YET TO FAIL.  FANTASTIC !!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE This!! Can I say more??</li>
    <li> Excellent shipping speed. Love the oil and the brand. Would have given 5 stars, but the bottle cap was not tightened completely and a slight amount of oil leaked out. As a result, the package had a wonderful soothing and relaxing aroma, but due to the oil residue on the label, part of the label foil peeled away. I would definitely order from this seller again, as I believe the issue I had was a YL manufacturing issue, not the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> This is a fab oil to use in the bath with some Epsom salts.</li>
    <li> Not just any lavender will do, I learned that when I was a teenager and suffering from a miserable rash all over. Now that I&#x27;ve tried Young Living&#x27;s lavender, I probably won&#x27;t bother with any other brand as the pain of using a less than therapeutic grade oil still lingers in my memory. My skin is my bodies first choice in letting me know anything is wrong to this day. :/ But I use lavender in my homemade lotions and it helps so much until I find and resolve the root problem.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soft scent , not too strong that overpowers the room. Works very well in my ultrasonic diffuser.</li>
    <li> Awesome essential oil. Young living is the best brand to buy.</li>
    <li> this was good, thought it would smell a bit different.</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations. Great! It helps with sleep.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a luxury product, it works well with oils, creams, lotions and potions.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> putting drops of lavender &amp; maybe aloe on burns helps them heal, also breathing lavender relaxes a person &amp;  lavender does alot of other things.</li>
    <li> The scent was way to  strong for me.  It did not smell like lavender.  Not crazy about this scent.</li>
    <li> Five stars company!  A little pricey.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful when needing to relax.  The fragrance is very strong so less is needed than it says on the bottle, which makes it longer lasting.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite oils!</li>
    <li> Love Young Living oil - but Young Living has forbidden their oils to be sold on Amazon, because people tamper with them. So anyone selling it on here is violating YL agreements - and may be messing with the product.    I suggest buying straight through the website by clicking the link below:  [...]</li>
    <li> I have used several of essential oils from Young Living Essential Oils. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is like a to-go-to oil.  I have found so many uses for this oil.  I have two now.  I have used it for cuts, allergies, relaxing, making a hair mask with coconut oil, sunburn treatment, etc.  I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you have kiddos!  I have been using it in the allergy trio (lavender, peppermint, lemon), all equal drops like  3-3-3 and diffusing it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear or smell authentic. Might be a knock off product. Would not suggest purchasing.</li>
    <li> While essential oils are not a new concept, I firmly believe that this company and grade of essential oil is not a very good quality. The smell is not very strong compared to other essential oils I have used.</li>
    <li> lavender is my favorite young living essential oil</li>
    <li> I used Lavender oil topically for poison ivy.  When exposed to sunlight, I broke out in horrible hives that lasted for a month.  You won&#x27;t read that in the YLO literature but the dermatologist said they see 5 to 7 people a week that have had bad, sometimes life threatening reactions to essential oils.</li>
    <li> Works very well in our diffuser.</li>
    <li> who doesn&#x27;t love lavender?</li>
    <li> Lavender essential oil is the best of all essential oils to me as It can be used for unlimited uses. I really like this one its very safe. I used it to reduce my acne scars and it reduced it by 60% in one month, I added it to my sister&#x27;s eczema lotion and it worked wonders for her. I used it as a scent with almond oil for my body also for relaxing bath..  Oh I love it</li>
    <li> This company is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t buy oils from anyone else anymore.  Young Living is worth the price but you can still find deals on Amazon.</li>
    <li> No real complaints. Except that if you are expecting a floral odor you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment arrives before expected. Now to see if this stuff works.</li>
    <li> Absoloutely love Young Living Essential Oils and was very happy to find the Lavender on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love Young Living oils. I have tried several different kinds and researched several different companies and find these to be the best quality, even if they are a bit pricey. You only need a few drops in a diffuser or you can apply it on skin. This one keeps my house calm and relaxed, even the dogs. I have chronic tension headaches and migraines and this really helps with that. It smells so good too!</li>
    <li> Quicker delivery than expected and love this oil! It smells great and helps my babies sleep by putting it in a diffuser.</li>
    <li> Was expecting this to arrive 5 to 7 days after I ordered it. Got to me in 2 days! Strong scent. Will re write my review once I have tried it out. Hoping it will help relax my little one to be able to sleep better. Will be used as a topical and in our humidifer. I&#x27;ll let you know how it goes!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like it has helped my daughter relax or sleep but its great for cuts. I am still using it in our humidifier at night. I guess i was hoping for miracle oil thay would have my daughter sleeping soundly all night. haha. I would still recommend this product for air purifier and cuts or scrapes. And once again has a great strong smell.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality oils that can be put to many uses. My primary use is for eczema, I mix 10 drops of Lavender oil with half a cup of extra virgin organic coconut oil and 10 drops of  Melrose essential oil from Young Living. This combination clears any rashes and eczema quickly.</li>
    <li> Relaxing, smells good!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing oil, with many healing properties, and it&#x27;s pure. This company has been around for 20 years.</li>
    <li> Great deal and it smells stronger than the NOW Lavender that I bought a while ago.</li>
    <li> I received this oil within 3 days of ordering.  Some of my friends were concerned that the oil would not be true Young Living oil...the oil was sealed just like the oils I receive when ordering directly from Young Living. The oil was pure and has been working just as I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister in law and she loves it. I will order again for myself now. Shipping was fast and the price was better than most places I found.</li>
    <li> This product does not smell good in my air diffuser.</li>
    <li> This gift is one my daughter dearly loves,  She uses the lavender every single night on the pillow cases.  It has such a soothing affect and lets you sleep restful.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, I use it for aroma therapy, I rub it on my skin and it&#x27;s very calming. I&#x27;m happy that it arrived on time too.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to use in a diffuser. I cannot use any sprays around my three parrots because they would die instantly.So I did some research,and found that this specific brand of oil(s) is the only one that is safe to use around pet birds. I have 4 dogs,as well,and this oil has helped tremendously in keeping down the &amp;#34;wet-dog&amp;#34; smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to use this oil as long as I have parrots.</li>
    <li> We put a few drops in a spray bottle with distilled water as an air fresher spray around the house. We get lots of compliments. Great for baths, in lotion, and in candles. Just add a few drops.</li>
    <li> We use this oil very often and love it. I have no complaints. Thank you for the fast shipping. Will be a customer in the future!!</li>
    <li> Great product and price!</li>
    <li> Lavender Essential Oil has soooo many uses and is great for your skin.  We are all using in my house for rashes, burns, cuts, skin care, in the bath and many other ways.</li>
    <li> Factory seal broken so product not safe for use. No way to tell what is really in the bottle. Young Living sells excellent products so it is a shame to have this situation where people may get an altered product and thus not experience the product at it&#x27;s best. I should have looked more closely at the picture which shows a broken seal and the questions that state don&#x27;t buy product from Amazon. Product comes up non-refundable.</li>
    <li> You cannot purchase a better essential oil than Young Living.  This lavender is a wonderful, true scent.  I will use it for facials, a mild antimicrobial, and I have made lavender cookies even!!!!!! The quality of this Young Living oil can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Sure helped my baby relax and go to sleep!</li>
    <li> A great smelling oil.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 10 years and love it.  I mainly use it around my temples, every night, to help me relax and have a good nights sleep.  Would recommend to any one who has trouble unwinding and sleeping.</li>
    <li> The best lavender oil you will have in the home.</li>
    <li> The bottle I received was more than half empty!</li>
    <li> love this for my horses and dogs</li>
    <li> So happy to be able to purchase</li>
    <li> Received on time and unbroken.</li>
    <li> If I had to pick one oil..this is it.</li>
    <li> Great smelling essential oil that smells like sleep !  Articles that I have read recently say that aromatherapy helps with sleep. This oil smells great !! Highly recommend for tranquility.</li>
    <li> Young living have amazing oils and they are the best on the market. Love these oils Nd all they do!</li>
    <li> Lavender oil has amazing healing properties. Great for scaley patches of dry skin and healing small cuts and scrapes. Love the smell too.</li>
    <li> very nice oil - trustworthy company</li>
    <li> I have been buying less expensive essential oils for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells and works so much better than the cheaper brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No comparison!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this oil every night to help me relax and fall asleep. It is incredible! It works very well.</li>
    <li> QUICK DELIVERY.......WILL RECOMMEND PRODUCT TO FRIENDS AFTER USE,IF IT WORKED AS INTENDED. WISH ITEM WILL WORK AS ADVERTIZED..THANKX IN ADVANCE IT WILL WORK.</li>
    <li> my daughter uses this for a non stress reliever  at night  she likes the aroma  but seems a little strong for me  use less drops i guess</li>
    <li> Young Living oils are wonderful! I use this one in a diffuser every other night.</li>
    <li> Good item just as described. The price is OK and it was packaged OK.</li>
    <li> Lavender oil is to me one of the most usable of the essential oil sets--or at least the one I use the most often. I want to only use essential grade oils and Young Living has been recommended to me personally so it&#x27;s the brand I use. The lavender oil soothes burns marvelously, is good for cuts and I have used it on scraped knees and so forth, and it is really very relaxing. Which is a compliment coming from me. (I&#x27;ve never particularly liked the way that lavender actually smells. A bit of an acquired taste, I guess.) The small 5ml size works for me...I don&#x27;t ever really douse it on anything so it lasts a while. Also, the last one I had (in a larger size) accidentally fell and broke on the floor--so the smaller the bottle, the less there is to lose (potentially). Or just don&#x27;t be clumsy like me. ;) Overall it&#x27;s a great product. I like having natural remedies when I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re safe and effective, so lavender oil fits the bill. I use it for a lot of things (burns, cuts, scrapes, rough skin, anxiety, better sleeping...you could even use it as a perfume if you wanted to I guess) so I have to admit I&#x27;m more interested in its medical uses than in its aromatherapy uses. But whichever use appeals to you, lavender oil is a sensible choice.</li>
    <li> USUALLY A BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING.  AFTER USING ESSENTIALL OIL......LAVENDAR.........TO &#x27;CALM&#x27; DOWN VERY ENERGETIC 4 AND 5 YR OLD NIECE AND NEPHEW, I AM CONVINCED!!!  THEY HAD BEEN ALMOST &#x27;HYPER&#x27; TEASING EACH OTHER, ETC.  SO I PUT SOME OIL ON THEIR WRISTS AND BOTTOMS OF THEIR FEET, AND WITHIN 5 MINUTES THEY WERE SITTING QUIETLY ON THE COUCH WATCHING CARTOONS. I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES!!!  MY NERVES AND I THANK YOU!!!  :)</li>
    <li> Young living oil is the purest and the best.</li>
    <li> Shipped immediately!!! I love this product!!! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t order this ever again. NOT worth the money. You can make your own lavender oil. Look ITT up on Pinterest. Doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell.</li>
    <li> Great stuff our house can&#x27;t function without it!</li>
    <li> It was just what  I needed, It worked very well.  It help ease the pain and swelling.</li>
    <li> I used this oil to help with anxiety, and I was suprised how well it works. It really does send calming signals to the brain.</li>
    <li> High quality oils from a trusted company, I use lavender on almost every kind of skin problem for a natural solution. This does not constitute medical advice, consult with a licensed physician, but I was more than satisfied with Young Living&#x27;s oil. Plus, it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> The oil is just as expected, I am happy with my purchase of the lavender Essential Oil by Young Living.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand for Essential Oils I will use! Awesome!! Lavender is the best starter Essential Oil. It is good for so many different uses.</li>
    <li> works great for relaxing my jaw!</li>
    <li> Use for burns and bruises</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. I&#x27;m not a fan of these personally. I think it&#x27;s modern quackery at it&#x27;s finest. It gives my wife and her friends hope though. And even if I feel that&#x27;s a psychosomatic response, if it makes them feel better, who am I to argue.</li>
    <li> Perfect for relaxation, soothing jangled nerves, making a blister go away, helping you fall asleep, moisturizing, soothing skin rashes, etc.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way.  It makes me sleepy every time I use it.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to NM which is a higher altitude than Im used to. I get really bad headaches. My masseuse uses this brand for headaches. Tried it once and it worked just like it did in her office. Ive had similar products from stores in the mall but never got the same results.</li>
    <li> The oils are so soft on the skin. Thee much healthy for your body.</li>
    <li> Love love love this oil.</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of lavender essential oil, but two bottles of purification blended oil were delivered instead.</li>
    <li> Use Young Living Lavender and Peace and Calming Essential Oil mix with coconut oil, rub on wrist and temples before bed for a good nights rest...</li>
    <li> I always have YL Lavender oil on hand to help with headaches and for adding to the children&#x27;s bath for calming before bedtime.  Love this product!</li>
