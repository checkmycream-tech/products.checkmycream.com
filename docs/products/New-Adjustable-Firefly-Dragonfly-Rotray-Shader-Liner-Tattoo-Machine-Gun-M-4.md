### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent, did not know quite what to expect but it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, for experienced tattoo artist,</li>
      <li>This is a great addition to my equipment line up</li>
      <li>It does adjust well between liner and shader,and the needle runner is great.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
      <li>Works good</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>n loved it.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Great price,and a good strong motor.</li>
      <li>amazing, this machine works wonders.</li>
      <li>I really liked it, however the guillotine screw stripped and the tube wouldnt stay in place unless i had a piece of tape wrapped around it.</li>
      <li>You get what you pay for, this is a good gun, but the parts used to make this gun is cheap.</li>
      <li>There are just so many knockoff design flaws.</li>
      <li>plastic tension screw&lt;br /&gt;-no adjustments, top adjustment seems to be for looks</li>
      <li>Didnt and probably wont try as a liner, more so</li>
      <li>Wife love the machine...</li>
      <li>Will order more</li>
      <li>it is of much better quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay to use for practice skin, or pig skin.</li>
      <li>The knob on top that&#x27;s supposed to adjust the stroke</li>
      <li>Professionals should know better.</li>
      <li>adjuster may not hold cheap parts ok otherwise</li>
      <li>all in all they  are great so far except for the needle bar stabilizer adjustment.</li>
      <li>Work good on daily use and perfect for just starting out with a rotary</li>
      <li>so cheap they could be disposable..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shading stayed smooth,</li>
      <li>It is light weight and quite.</li>
      <li>i managed to keep it smooth.</li>
      <li>I bought one of these cheap drangonfly rotary machines to try my hand at rotary vs. coil.</li>
      <li>There is no adjustment available on these at all.</li>
      <li>and it was as described not disappointed at all.</li>
      <li>Light weight and supprisingly powerful.</li>
      <li>If you want a real Firefly or Dragonfly machine buy from a reputable tattoo supplier.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get a full line in.</li>
      <li>Set up quickly.</li>
      <li>Overall very light and easy to hold.</li>
      <li>as a seasoned tattoo artist id say its nothing to be excited over but for the price, cant complain.</li>
      <li>and you have to have it turned right in order for it to run.</li>
      <li>small but very nice working</li>
      <li>Low Price and runs very smooth.</li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s definitely one of my better machines.</li>
      <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good little machine for such a cheap price.</li>
      <li>quiet, smooth, first time using it</li>
      <li>Too much plastic and aluminum.</li>
      <li>i dont really know my soninlaw got it.</li>
      <li>Close to Bing a real dragon</li>
      <li>But i much preferred rotary, so i ordered another.</li>
      <li>The motor isn&#x27;t constant and overheats after about 2 hours of use, let it cool and it will work again.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend buying THIS version of the dragonfly instead of other listings if you are looking for a decent quality cheap rotary machine.</li>
      <li>Garbage that is the only way i can describe this yet another china made for the price not quality what else is new right</li>
      <li>Did not expect much for a price of 19.99 machine plus shipping, however this machine is not even worthy of being called an imitation.</li>
      <li>adjuster doesnt do anything for the needle stroke, but kind of expected minimal happieness from a $12 machine!!</li>
      <li>motor seems ok, i mean its not swiss, nor did i pay for one...</li>
      <li>works ok not a lot power  very small</li>
      <li>They both blew up within 5 mins of each other, but at the price i paid, i got my moneys worth.</li>
      <li>so my expectations weren&#x27;t high knowing they were Chinese Firefly knockoffs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a typical cheap made Chinese tattoo machine.</li>
      <li>The only problem that I had was a short in the mote but that shouldn&#x27;t take much to fix</li>
      <li>so had to go back to old gun</li>

<li> So it will slow way down when you take the needle bar off the tube.</li>
<li> As stated I wanted to get the feel of a lighter machine without spending a small fortune.</li>
<li> I purchased this and another of the same style to use on some fake skin to get the feel for a lighter machine</li>
<li> Hard on the finger tips and</li>
<li> no good stop selling</li>
<li> complete  waste of money very disappointed</li>
<li> Weak motor, adjustment doesn&#x27;t work, tube vice strips out.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s really tough to adjust.</li>
<li> Total crap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i dont really know my soninlaw got it.</li>
    <li> adjuster doesnt do anything for the needle stroke, but kind of expected minimal happieness from a $12 machine!! it is a deal for the price for beginning artists! Professionals should know better.</li>
    <li> Garbage that is the only way i can describe this yet another china made for the price not quality what else is new right</li>
    <li> Not even. Close to Bing a real dragon fly.like a toy from swapp meet sums sums suks no good stop selling</li>
    <li> Ordered this machine and used it today, its not so bad....as a seasoned tattoo artist id say its nothing to be excited over but for the price, cant complain. if it get you through one tattoo it paid for itself right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-weak material, plastic frame, plastic tension screw&lt;br /&gt;-no adjustments, top adjustment seems to be for looks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor seems ok, i mean its not swiss, nor did i pay for one...so wht can you expect. I have a knock-off Stealth and Swash drive style rotaries, and this Firefly works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shading stayed smooth, dunno if id say because of skill and experience i managed to keep it smooth. Didnt and probably wont try as a liner, more so cause im jus too stuck on coils for lining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, for experienced tattoo artist, if youre look to try rotary but dont wanna jump the gun and get into Bishop, Stigma, etc. It wont hurt you to try this out giving you dont get a faulty/defective item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If youd like to see the piece i did with this you can find me/my work on Instagram #tattookaleo  ill tag the picture #fireflyrotary</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but its not great.  It was alright for a 8 dollar tattoo gun. It does the job.</li>
    <li> the clasp at the top that doesn&#x27;t even serve a purpose popped off as soon as the needle hit the skin, revealed that this crap machine is held together my hot glue. I wasn&#x27;t expecting bishop quality but like wtf. I couldn&#x27;t even get a full line in. literally had to stop, and just load up my coil machines.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these cheap drangonfly rotary machines to try my hand at rotary vs. coil. I really liked it, however the guillotine screw stripped and the tube wouldnt stay in place unless i had a piece of tape wrapped around it. But i much preferred rotary, so i ordered another. They both blew up within 5 mins of each other, but at the price i paid, i got my moneys worth. So i ordered this one here (looks the same, costs the same) and i have to say, it is of much better quality. When i tighten the guillotine screw, i see the metal (not plastic like the 2 similar ones i had) piece coming in to hold the tube in place. I was under the assumption that the screw itself held it in place. I highly recommend buying THIS version of the dragonfly instead of other listings if you are looking for a decent quality cheap rotary machine.</li>
    <li> Low Price and runs very smooth. I will definitely order more. Light weight and supprisingly powerful. Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Definitely can&#x27;t complain. For the price, it&#x27;s definitely one of my better machines.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good little machine for such a cheap price. They shouldn&#x27;t advertise it as a Firefly machine because it&#x27;s clearly not.</li>
    <li> A waste of money, a cheap Chinese clone that is poorly made. Weak motor, adjustment doesn&#x27;t work, tube vice strips out. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Work good on daily use and perfect for just starting out with a rotary</li>
    <li> adjuster may not hold cheap parts ok otherwise</li>
    <li> works ok not a lot power  very small</li>
    <li> I purchased this and another of the same style to use on some fake skin to get the feel for a lighter machine so my expectations weren&#x27;t high knowing they were Chinese Firefly knockoffs. There is no adjustment available on these at all. The knob on top that&#x27;s supposed to adjust the stroke doesn&#x27;t even touch the adjustment spring at all. So one was set permanently at a hard medium stroke, and the other was shorter and much harder. The pin that doubles as a bar stabilizer and speed control doesn&#x27;t move if pressure is applied. So it will slow way down when you take the needle bar off the tube. To compensate you have to run them between 9-10 volts depending on the set up. The spring that holds the wheel against the needle bar arm gets in the way of the tube. The motor isn&#x27;t constant and overheats after about 2 hours of use, let it cool and it will work again. Intermittently. There are just so many knockoff design flaws. As stated I wanted to get the feel of a lighter machine without spending a small fortune. I would not recommend using this on anyone for tattooing! It&#x27;s okay to use for practice skin, or pig skin. If you want a real Firefly or Dragonfly machine buy from a reputable tattoo supplier.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, this is a good gun, but the parts used to make this gun is cheap. So it might not last as long as you want it to. But I would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> adjuster is for cosmetic purposes only.&lt;br /&gt;made out of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;tubes slip out while tattooing.&lt;br /&gt;screw is plastic.&lt;br /&gt;this thing sucks overall</li>
    <li> Did not expect much for a price of 19.99 machine plus shipping, however this machine is not even worthy of being called an imitation. Total crap.</li>
    <li> Wife love the machine... quiet, smooth, first time using it n loved it. Will order more</li>
    <li> Excellent, did not know quite what to expect but it was a pleasant surprise. It gets used often and would buy another</li>
    <li> This is not a real \\&quot;Dragonfly\\&quot; machine !!!!!!!!!! This is not a real \\&quot;Dragonfly\\&quot; machine !!!!!!!!!! This is not a real \\&quot;Dragonfly\\&quot; machine !!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Only used them once. all in all they  are great so far except for the needle bar stabilizer adjustment. That&#x27;s really tough to adjust. Hard on the finger tips and</li>
    <li> well i guess my friend isn&#x27;t a liar ... 10 bux of amazingness...just runs like a dream ..powerfull i even purchased a case...so cheap they could be disposable..</li>
    <li> Overall very light and easy to hold. The only problem that I had was a short in the mote but that shouldn&#x27;t take much to fix</li>
    <li> amazing, this machine works wonders.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.It does all I need.Set up quickly.This is a great addition to my equipment line up</li>
    <li> It is light weight and quite. Works good we like it and it was as described not disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> this shud be replica soon as u put power to it it blows the top off and loses power JUNK!!!!!</li>
    <li> small but very nice working</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a typical cheap made Chinese tattoo machine. Too much plastic and aluminum.</li>
    <li> The adjustment doesn&#x27;t work that well. There seems to be no stroke difference and you have to have it turned right in order for it to run. So if you don&#x27;t switch between liner and shader it&#x27;s good but if you want to use this machine for both it isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Heres no adjusting how hard or soft it hits. I woukd neeever use it for black n grey, too choppy.</li>
    <li> Great price,and a good strong motor. Been using it for a couple of months,mostly adjusted to shader,for extended periods of time with no issues.Just keep it lubed and you&#x27;re good to go. It does adjust well between liner and shader,and the needle runner is great.Solid machine especially for the price.</li>
    <li> worst gun i have ever bought......Just got it today only ran for two minutes  before it started shorting out my tattoo  machine so had to go back to old gun complete  waste of money very disappointed</li>
