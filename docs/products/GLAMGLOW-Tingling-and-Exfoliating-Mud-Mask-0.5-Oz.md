### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall this is the best option if you want to test out the glamglow and not break the bank, but the glamglow itself is just eh.</li>
      <li>Very nice stuff!</li>
      <li>I wanted to LOVE this product, I wanted it to revolutionize my skin care routine!!</li>
      <li>very nice mask and exfoliator.</li>
      <li>you have to invest in good products I would repurchase again and again........</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>it sure tingles!</li>
      <li>and I love what it does!</li>
      <li>I liked this product</li>
      <li>That was a great option, glad i was able to save money and find out that this stuff isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
      <li>but my face was very smooth.</li>
      <li>Will not repurchase for more</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t  think the mask added to the smoothness but for sure to the experience.</li>
      <li>Love these masks I use it every week</li>
      <li>I love this mask gives me glowy skin.</li>
      <li>I would&#x27;ve given 2 stars, but I love the product.</li>
      <li>Works ok not as good as they make it seem and for that much I want top quality</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not any better than the cheap stuff.</li>
      <li>As far as exfoliating and pulling out all the yuckyness, it didn&#x27;t do that great.</li>
      <li>I think this works just fine but way overpriced.</li>
      <li>My face was so smooth all day.</li>
      <li>But once I got past that, I loved it!!</li>
      <li>It smells nice and I would recommend anyone who needs a new mask product.</li>
      <li>But it honestly didn&#x27;t do anything, NOT a single tingle, and there were large particles in the bottle which to be honest</li>
      <li>Glad I did the sample versus buying the the large bottle.  </li>
      <li>Overall the product is good and a lot cheaper than you can get it anywhere else.</li>
      <li>My skin felt good after using it and after a few uses I noticed my skin getting better.</li>
      <li>It might be a bit overpriced, but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>but right after I wash this off I go and apply the blue glamglow mask (thearstymud) and my skin looks amazing.</li>
      <li>Worth every dollar if you want your skin to look right</li>
      <li>This mask is great for exfoliating, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as I like the other glamglow products.</li>
      <li>Ive had more of a tightening and clean feeling from using Queen Helene which i will be buying for $2 from my local drugstore.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be buying the large size!</li>
      <li>I put a hot towel treated with some tea tree oil on my face then used the mask.</li>
      <li>It really does work, it helps get rid of acne!</li>
      <li>I used it twice thinking maybe the first time</li>
      <li>Tried it last evening and it was ok</li>
      <li>Love this product,makes my skin soft and natural glow after using😃</li>
      <li>Thanks for letting me try it though.</li>
      <li>and what is in there, it gets clogged very easy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>made my face look smooth and younger.</li>
      <li>but I really like how this made my face feel.</li>
      <li>Unbelievably tiny container, I was honestly expecting something a bit larger.</li>
      <li>May update my review after a few more uses (might be able to get 1 more use out of this container, it&#x27;s that small!).</li>
      <li>i love the other glam glow products though.</li>
      <li>I read a lot of great reviews for this product but the size I got (really really small) didn&#x27;t let me experience it enough.</li>
      <li>I have purchased similar products for half the cost that did just as good.</li>
      <li>I ordered the full size about a week later!</li>
      <li>There are better product out there for less.</li>
      <li>Did not feel any particular effect or difference.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean without your skin feeling dry.</li>
      <li>ok but it&#x27;s way too little for that price.$9.00 for 2 application only.</li>
      <li>It did leave my skin feeling extremely soft.</li>
      <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself-</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get it right, but again the second time there was no tingling and my skin didn&#x27;t feel any different after.</li>
      <li>I barely received enough product for ONE application.</li>

<li> Definitely disappointed.</li>
<li> So a C- for that part :(</li>
<li> The tubes were just in horrible condition.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered 5 of these, and you couldn&#x27;t read the labels on 3 of them. It&#x27;s so smudged you can&#x27;t even make out &amp;#34;GLAMGLOW&amp;#34;.  I would&#x27;ve given 2 stars, but I love the product. The tubes were just in horrible condition.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like the packaging. There isn&#x27;t alot in there and what is in there, it gets clogged very easy.&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t feel a tingle like i was expecting. i love the other glam glow products though.</li>
    <li> very nice mask and exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I love this mask gives me glowy skin. Worth every dollar if you want your skin to look right you have to invest in good products I would repurchase again and again........</li>
    <li> Very nice stuff! Goes on weird, kinda chunky. But once I got past that, I loved it!! I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> This is not worth it. I barely received enough product for ONE application. Definitely disappointed. Will not repurchase for more product.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself- i was not expecting what I got. This mask is supposed to &amp;#34;tingle.&amp;#34; However, I can tell the difference between tingling and BURNING. This product burned my face!</li>
    <li> It did leave my skin feeling extremely soft. So an A+ for softness. As far as exfoliating and pulling out all the yuckyness, it didn&#x27;t do that great. So a C- for that part :(</li>
    <li> I liked this product but I didn&#x27;t notice any tingling. My skin felt good after using it and after a few uses I noticed my skin getting better.</li>
    <li> was nervous afetr reading reviews but this made my skin, literally, glow. I ordered the full size about a week later!</li>
    <li> Glam Glow actually worked for me. It leaves your skin feeling clean without your skin feeling dry. When you put the product on, you start to see your skin extract all the blackheads out from your face. It smells nice and I would recommend anyone who needs a new mask product. It might be a bit overpriced, but it&#x27;s worth the price. One bottle this size would last you about 3 months depending on your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the price.</li>
    <li> I like it but found cheaper at another retailer</li>
    <li> This mask is great for exfoliating, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as I like the other glamglow products. The leaf pieces in this mask are a bit annoying to me Personally.</li>
    <li> I think this works just fine but way overpriced. I have purchased similar products for half the cost that did just as good.</li>
    <li> Love these masks I use it every week and it tend to dry my skin a little bit but right after I wash this off I go and apply the blue glamglow mask (thearstymud) and my skin looks amazing.</li>
    <li> Cleaned deep down. My face was so smooth all day. I could actually see a glow to my face. Didn&#x27;t expect that. Awsome product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It really does work, it helps get rid of acne!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of great reviews for this product but the size I got (really really small) didn&#x27;t let me experience it enough.</li>
    <li> I was unimpressed by this product. Did not feel any particular effect or difference.</li>
    <li> This was a tiny baby sample.  Glad I did the sample versus buying the the large bottle.  The product stung quite a bit. Thanks for letting me try it though.</li>
    <li> great product! made my face look smooth and younger.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably tiny container, I was honestly expecting something a bit larger. Tried it last evening and it was ok I guess. Minimal tingling, and my face was a bit red afterwards. May update my review after a few more uses (might be able to get 1 more use out of this container, it&#x27;s that small!). Overall it seems WAY overpriced compared to similar masks.</li>
    <li> I wanted to LOVE this product, I wanted it to revolutionize my skin care routine!! It fell flat. I bought this tiny bottle as a tester to avoid spending 45-70 on the regular sized glamglow.  That was a great option, glad i was able to save money and find out that this stuff isn&#x27;t for me.  But it honestly didn&#x27;t do anything, NOT a single tingle, and there were large particles in the bottle which to be honest freaked me out... literally a twig came out, and what looked like black plastic leaves.  I used it twice thinking maybe the first time I didn&#x27;t get it right, but again the second time there was no tingling and my skin didn&#x27;t feel any different after. Ive had more of a tightening and clean feeling from using Queen Helene which i will be buying for $2 from my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is the best option if you want to test out the glamglow and not break the bank, but the glamglow itself is just eh.</li>
    <li> Love this product,makes my skin soft and natural glow after using😃</li>
    <li> I got this as a bonus item with an order of something else. I didn&#x27;t  use for a while and when I finally did I used it as a treat. I removed makeup with coconut  oil, then washed my face. I put a hot towel treated with some tea tree oil on my face then used the mask. It did sting quite  a bit but I did use tea tree oil. It had bits of leaves which I did not care for. I left it on my face till hard and removed with water then washed my face with papaya/rice milk soap and my Clarisonic. The process  was long but my face was very smooth. I don&#x27;t  think the mask added to the smoothness but for sure to the experience. Overall...it was alright, but I would not purchase for that price alone.</li>
    <li> I like the product, just don&#x27;t like the leaves that comes out. I&#x27;m sure if I ordered the jar it wouldn&#x27;t be as bad. Overall the product is good and a lot cheaper than you can get it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> ok but it&#x27;s way too little for that price.$9.00 for 2 application only. I will not buy it again. Waste of money. There are better product out there for less.</li>
    <li> Works ok not as good as they make it seem and for that much I want top quality it&#x27;s not any better than the cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this and I love what it does! Exfoliates and leaves my face glowing but hydrated!</li>
    <li> it sure tingles! mine had larger pieces of the clumpy stuff but I really like how this made my face feel. I&#x27;ll be buying the large size!</li>
