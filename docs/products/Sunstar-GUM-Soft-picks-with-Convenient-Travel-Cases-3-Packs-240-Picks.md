    <li> Work well and convenient.</li>
    <li> These are great and were recommended by the dentist. They also work wonderfully  for cleaning wax from my hearing aids.&lt;br /&gt;RRC</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item in the past with no problem.  The product is not up to previous standard of quality.  It lifterally bend when you clean between teeth.  I will ne er purchas GUM products  again.</li>
    <li> Excellent for cleaning between teeth.</li>
    <li> bought them for my granddaughter.  She has braces and they are perfect.  Easy and reliable company.</li>
    <li> Wrong item I bought but it works do&#x27;s the same thing I wase&#x27;nt  looking very closely Sunstar GUM Soft-picks with Convenient Travel Cases, 3 Packs, 240 Picks  for a very good price the shpping was very fast Thank You</li>
    <li> I have recently had 4 molar implants. The first two (Upper) were no problem with flossing and brushing. The last two lower implants have been more difficult to take care of because of the food that gets lodged between the implants around the post. There is an area that drives me crazy until I get the food out so I have been on a mission of sorts to see what works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given the GUM soft picks by a Dental Hygienist (along with some other samples) and really like this product.  It continues to remove food that some of the small go-between brushes miss.  These soft-picks are small, efficient and very easy to carry in your purse or wallet.  Nice to have at the office or to use after a restaurant meal.  I now keep a package in my purse.  The bristles are flexible and tapered to fit between small spaces and dislodge food.  The bristles feel like rubber, but it states on the package that the product is LATEX FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest that you either purchase small quantities or ask for samples the next time you visit your dentist.  I found that a lot of these special brushes &amp; products come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Buying a small quantity makes sense to see if you like the size and shape.</li>
    <li> These are so much better that just floss or any toothpick!</li>
    <li> I find these tooth-picks indispensable. I&#x27;ve been using them for years and always carry a few in my purse in the convenient travel case (provided). This was a good buy so I decided to stock up.</li>
    <li> i have been using these for a while now and I love them...they get the job done and they do it gently with soft rubberized bristles.</li>
    <li> This is one of the perfect products. It meets a need that I have and it is portable, light weight and very effective for removing food from under bridges and between teeth.</li>

    <li> Excellent product and delivery.</li>
    <li> Though the traditional floss gets between your teeth, this product cleans and massages the gums at the base of your teeth. After using these for a while, I went in to the dentist for dental cleaning. His first comment was, \\&quot;You have great dental hygiene!\\&quot; Before using this product, I had never had such accolades on my dental habits. I still use floss for cleaning between my teeth but I use these at the base of my teeth. Keeps your gums really healthy!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. I looked all over,  and this was the best price.</li>
    <li> Great for removing my lunch at work.</li>
    <li> Excellent for cleaning between teeth, especially for areas where flossing isn&#x27;t possible (splints, braces, etc).&lt;br /&gt;Rigid enough to remove food particles, but flexible enough that you can&#x27;t accidentally injure your gums. Also includes a plastic case small enough that you can keep in purse or pocket any time.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended years ago by my dentist when I had a splint put in, have been using them since.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these.  I like them, and ordered the supersize pack, but was disappointed to learn the &amp;#34;Travel Case&amp;#34; is really tiny. ...Only room for a few picks.</li>
    <li> Way better than the picks made with metal and brush material. These are gentle but do the job!</li>
    <li> These are the greatest! I keep them in my purse and everywhere!</li>
    <li> Use these every day.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands and have come back to &amp;#34;Gum&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Sunstar picks have the right balance of texture to clean effectively without my gums bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;The proof is the accolades I get from the Dental Hygienist when I use this product daily.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended this between cleanings.  Not good for those with tightly spaced teeth.  I keep one packet at home and one in car to use while sitting in traffic.  I am on my 3rd reorder.  I use it daily with dental floss and have had excellent check ups.</li>
    <li> These save my gums and help with tarter control.  So convenient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  These are soft and comfortable and effective to use.</li>
