<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did not see that much different on my face. I used both dry and wet methods. I am kind of some what disappointed due to many good reviews for this product.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my aesthetician and it&#x27;s amazing. I use it once a week and my skin feels great and looks amazing. It has a little heat when you apply it and smells good too. This is a must have for your facial regimen.</li>
    <li> I can tell this is going to be a long term, fulfilling relationship....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an exfoliant addict and the only thing that comes close to this is Philosophy&#x27;s Microdelivery Peel system. This, however is superior in that the grains are even finer and that it also contains an AHA to give you dual level of exfoliation. It does, indeed, noticeably warm up when you apply it, so maybe other reviewers got a batch that maybe didn&#x27;t warm so much or they are desensitized.&lt;br /&gt;It works best on a dry face or a very slightly dampened face. I wash my face in the shower first, pat dry, then scrub away with this stuff, leave on while I wash the rest of my body, rinse and enjoy baby soft skin all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face!</li>
    <li> There is not another exfoliate out there that can beat this product.  I LOVE IT!!!  My face is so soft afterwards.  I have very sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this product in the 3 years I have been using it.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product through a hand-massage.  I mentioned to the esthitician that I was hoping for something with a bit more grit - she responded that this product works more like a \\&quot;chemical.\\&quot;  I could feel a little warmth as she gently massaged my hands.  Once the product was rinsed from my hands, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth my hands felt.  This product costs fifty bucks in the store...this price is a steal....and the tube is very generous.  I dab a little product on my skin, wet my fingertips and massage...it does create a little warmth and the aftereffects are wonderful.  Try it!</li>
    <li> Love love love this product!!! My face feels smooth and I feel like my moisturizer  absorbs so well after I exfoliate with this. I also follow with the vitamin mask. Fantastic combo. I slightly wet my fingers and apply to my dry face for best results.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  You only have to use a pea size amount to cleanse your face.</li>
    <li> I used Dermalogica products in my 20&#x27;s and likely did not use them in the correct way because I put them to the side for alot others along the way. However recently I was told by Dermatologist I needed to use an Exfoliant to help revive my lackluster skin. Keeping in mind I also use Retin-A .004% gel, she instructed me the products were to not to overlap/nor be used on separate days. But she would not suggest which product to go with. Insisting I find my own product because she does not endorse any one particular product. So after reading countless reviews, I decided to revisit Dermalogica. My first choice--Multivitamin Thermafoliant was the best choice. It has not irritated my adult acne, nor has it caused any over dryness or other harsh results. Instead it has given me soft skin, with an addictive glow that I can&#x27;t see myself without now!!</li>
    <li> you want to look fresh,,,order it do not wait</li>
    <li> it is really nice product! leave mi skin so so soft</li>
    <li> This product does well for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best exfoliant I have used.  I love the heat as you put it on your skin.  Dermalogica is the best product.</li>
    <li> Best exfoliator out there in my opinion. Warms on your face and leaves it glowing and soft. I use it 4-5 times a week in the shower. My daughter loves it too.</li>
    <li> I use this product for some time already and it changed my skin, I love all Dermalogica products. Try and you will see!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It warms for a few seconds on initial application as you begin rubbing it in small circles on your skin. After a few uses, it really does seem to make a difference. I would recommend using a day and/or night cream as well.</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly, but glad i could order it. Thanks</li>
    <li> bought it for my mother.. she loves it</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I use it daily and like the results I get very much. I recommend it highly. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love the heat activation.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week rather than the daily microfoliant.  Both work best in the shower for ease of rinsing.  Most exfoliation when used on dry skin and followed by cleanser.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on its excellent reviews.  I have to say I&#x27;m a little disappointed. The product feels nice and warm going on, but it really hasn&#x27;t done anything special for me.  I prefer the Hydroxatone microdermabrasion.  The product leaves my face feeling very soft and moisturized after I wash it off. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff!!!...until it made me start breaking out after a week. I have acne prone skin though so I passed it along to my mother. If you dont have oily skin though, definitely worth the buy if you dont mind spending a few $. It warms up on contact and the exfoliant beads are very small and makes for a luxurious spa treatment. Sad I cant use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product for removing dead skin off face</li>
    <li> Awesome product...nice to get sal acids and retinols in a cleanser. Leaves the skin smooth and soft nothing else to say</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Dermologica is a great skin product line.  I treasure this product and use it bi-weekly.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Great product.</li>
    <li> I had used a sample of this before and was intrigued. Now using it on a regular basis, I love it. The fine grit exfoliates my skin in an even, gentle way. It also heats up when you rub it on your face. I will keep buying this.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 10 years also, as the microbeads don&#x27;t tear your skin as you exfoliate and as you use this there is heat generated in the cleansing/exfoliating process. Leaves my skin as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Good n trusted brand in Asian country too.. N I use this product for very long n I could see result for use ! Love it</li>
    <li> I use it about 3 times per week &amp; am getting good results.</li>
    <li> A great exfoliant, that can be used in the shower daily.  Love the abrasive texture and how my skin feels after.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Smells fresh, feels amazing, and makes skin soft. A little bit goes a long way, so it lasts! I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use it once a week when I feel my pores are clogged up by my everyday makeup. It generates a bit of heat and is easy to wash off. face feels smooth and clean after use.</li>
    <li> love this product.  The heat it generates and the tiny granules make your skin feel radiant.  A go to product</li>
    <li> I have tried several exfoliants, including another by Dermalogica, but this one is best by far. Feels like I&#x27;ve had a facial after using it. Good for the neck too!</li>
    <li> This is great if you always wanted a clearer, spotless and even skin. Works well wet or dry, prefer it with a little damp on face . I use this twice a week and scrub  it on on the T-zone, indeed it does a good job to exfoliate the skin and prepare for toning and moisture after, you can also mask you face after it. I use the daily Microfoliant as well but it does not give same effect as this. use it at least once every week and also with rich repair moisturier, you skin will feels softer, smoother and spotless after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for exfoliating the skin on my face....this one is by far the best!!  At first, I used it on damp skin but found I like it better when I use on my skin when it&#x27;s dry.  It makes my skin feel smooth and perfect!  I bought it to use with my Clarsonic but I think this works so well that I don&#x27;t need the machine with it.  That makes it perfect for travel!  I think one reason it works so well is because the grit it so very fine that it doesn&#x27;t make my pores bigger and it feels like it&#x27;s polishing my skin. I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s but this product would be fantastic for any age.</li>
    <li> makes my face feel awesome! warms slightly while applying, small grain exfoliation. use without water for more exfoliation or with water for gentler effect. after use my skin feels soft and looks fresh!</li>
    <li> Great product. Feel the warmth on contact with the face and can tell it&#x27;s improving my skin tone. Anxious to see results as I continue to use.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but I feel that it&#x27;s a very quality product. My dead skin cells don&#x27;t seem to slough off naturally - which causes problems with pores and gives me the &amp;#34;blah face&amp;#34; look. I don&#x27;t use this everyday...I use it every few days to help rejuvenate my face.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Makes my skin feel absolutely awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this product over the many other exfoliants I&#x27;ve used. The micro-beads makes for gentle, even exfoliation without a lot of effort.  I find most other exfoliants have a lot more cleanser and larger exfoliating particles which forces you to scrub longer which irritates my skin after a while.  I try others, but I always go back to this one!</li>
    <li> really expensive per oz, but this cleanser actually feels like it&#x27;s scrubbing and cleaning your face. skin just feels refreshed and clean afterwards, which sounds cliche for any cleaner, but this is the first one that actually makes you feel that way. and for such a strong cleaner, it has a very pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I have tried tons and this one is by far the perfect amount of grittyness I was looking for and the smell is nice.  My face felt amazing after using this.  I will always use this face exfoliator</li>
    <li> I use this a few times a week in the shower after I cleanse with my emollient-rich cleanser from Lancome. After rubbing this around on my face for a minute I also like to leave it on for an additional minute or two after. Remember that you may want to rub hard, but it&#x27;s not necessary. Since using this exfoliant I have noticed that the small black dots in the pores on my nose and chin are completely gone!!!  I have extremely sensitive, fair skin and it seems like everything I tried used to make me break out. This has a clean, fresh scent and the texture of the scrub is extremely fine. I also don&#x27;t wear any makeup besides mascara and I feel even more confident now than before with just a moisterizing cream.  I am proud to show off my glowing skin and great complexion every day.  Thank you Dermalogica :)  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a gentle and natural facial exfoliant.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when looking for something for dry skin. After searching online and reading reviews online I opted to try the thermafoliant and loved it! It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and I would highly recommend this product to others!</li>
    <li> I use this product 3x a week and it is wonderful! Exfoliating has been the best solution to my slight adult acne and larger pores. I love that it heats up on contact. Overall, I have noticed a huge change in my skin and smaller pores from using only dermalogica products for the past 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Best product ever I use at night and do not remove</li>
    <li> I like the way this product makes my skin feel after completing the scrubbing process.  I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> this is my 3rd bottle. I haven&#x27;t had major acne problem after i use this. I used this every two days at least. make my skin much smoother. you will also see your skin tone looks blighter after you use it, just be careful not to use this product too long. it may hurt your skin.Lots of people asked me what am I using for my skin and I recommended this.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It is such a good exfoliator and polisher!  My skin looks and feels so much better after every use. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Another waste of my endeavor to look younger!  I used the entire tube as directed and see no difference.  After using all of this product, I found a store brand defoliant that works just as well for a lot less money.  I won&#x27;t order this product again.</li>
    <li> The product is good as far as a dermabrasive goes.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth $40, however.  I prefer the Dermalogica Daily Exfoliant.  Also, the first week that I used it, the tube split through in the middle.  So now, it&#x27;s very inconvenient to use.  I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> The fine grains in this mask help to polish and remove dead skin cells leaving the omplexion extrememly smooth and soft.  And I love the smell and tingly feeling it has, too!  I really love the Dermalogica products!</li>
    <li> Terrific product. FYI, best not to scrub too hard or too long or thin skinned areas on the nose and cheeks will have red patches afterwards. I use once a week with great results.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my face so soft.  You only need to use a small amount.  It works great if you rub in on your clean face when your face is dry and then use water to wash it off.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I must say that this is a \\&quot;top notch\\&quot; facial and neck exfoliator. I have been using it every other day for a little over a week. My face is no longer dull and flakey. I have new bright skin! This product is full of vitamins for your skin. Go for it girls....give it a try.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this exfoliant.  Easy to use and works well.  My face and fingers feel smooth and ready to absorb the hydration after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with this product</li>
    <li> Very nice scrub... it does heat up when rubbing on your face.  It is really a great exfoliant and I use it about once a month to keep my skin looking bright.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Dermalogica products and I was hoping to use this product in the shower but you have to apply it on non wet skin, scrub it in and then wash it off with warm water.  I use it once a week but for daily use I have been using another store bought exfoliating scrub which I am in love with.  Definitely try this and see if you like it.</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and rosacea and this exfoliant transforms my skin. You can feel the difference on the fingers you apply it with.</li>
    <li> This has been a favorite for quite some time. Twice a week is perfect. Wish I,d been saving money sooner by buying it on Amazon instead of my salon.</li>
    <li> This is more than I normally spend on skin care products, but I love the way my skin feels after using it so I will splurge on occasion. Since I only use it once or twice a week it lasts for a long time as well. It gives my skin such a healthy glow! I lke that the grainy bits are so tiny that it doesnt feel like it scratching or damaging my skin like some other exfoliating products out there. I use it in the shower with a wet face, but you can also use on a dry face if you need the exra exfoliation, which is probably a good idea the first few times to really get the outer layer removed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent price</li>
    <li> I do like the heating effect, but it really doesn&#x27;t last long enough to be more than a gimmick. Or does it? Not sure... for now, I&#x27;ve changed to using St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz, and I&#x27;m very happy with it--and the price is better :)</li>
    <li> Gentle on my skin which is sensitive.  I use it once or twice a week.  I love Dermalogica, it is all about healthy skin.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful exfoliant. Not harsh at all. It leaves my skin very soft. Thermafoliant is sort of a misnomer. It only gets warm for a few seconds when water first mixes with it so the \\&quot;thermal\\&quot; part is not actually benificial but I still recomend it.</li>
    <li> First of all, LOVE Dermalogica products. Quality &amp; I can see results! I started on \\&quot;D\\&quot; products about 8 months ago thru my spa I go to on a monthly basis. I was doing massages every month, but then wanted to try facials. Fell in LOVE with facials! I am 37 years old w/  a medium skin tone, combination to oily skin, which is very helpful, the slight oil helps! I tan easily, enjoyed my share of tanning booths &amp; outdoor tanning in my teens/twenties &amp; even into my thirties. In the past few years started caring more about wearing sunscreen. Anyway, as I&#x27;m starting to take better care of my skin, I began using \\&quot;D\\&quot; products several months ago &amp; really see a difference! LOVE this exfolliant, twice  a week W/ the SPF 30 moisturizer. Love the toning mist &amp; daily exfoliant scrub on the age smart line too! Also......I&#x27;m finding buying \\&quot;D\\&quot; products on Amazon WAY cheaper than at your spas, salon, etc...Just check before you buy at your salon/spa first!</li>
    <li> Another great product from Dermalogica.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. Just after 2 uses my skin flt polished and smooth. I had a rosy glow that my Husband noticed. The Product is easy to use and does wonders for the skin. I have found a new product that works for me. It met all my expectations and then some. I</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It feels warm on skin and leaves my skin feeling smooth and healthy after use. You can use it with or without water and both give amazing results. Skin is much healthier after use.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this product. She uses it regularly. Her skin looks great. I&#x27;d buy this product for her again.</li>
    <li> I use this product 2X a week and just love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever I love it</li>
    <li> Warm scrub that does the job perfectly.  You only need a little to scrub your face completely and you determine how much &amp;#34;friction&amp;#34; you want.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It&#x27;s a gentle exfoliating cream which works well with a Clairsonic.  Makes facial skin smooth and glowing after useage.</li>
    <li> My husband discovered this when I gave him a gift certificate for a facial . He has used it regularly for years.</li>
    <li> Super fine granules that really polish skin! Smells orangey and feels warm as you massage it onto your face.</li>
    <li> Salon Dermalogica Mutlivitamin Thermafoliant at a great price!  This is a micro scrub for sensitive skin, that heats up as you apply water.  Perfect for sentitive skin.  I use this 3-5 times a week.  Compliments well with the Dermal Clay Cleanser (My favorite, that I use everyday).</li>
    <li> Not as impressed with this product.  Can be rough on the face.</li>
    <li> This is pretty cool... when you first put it on your face it is very warm. I have been having issues with acne and this has really helped.</li>
    <li> wifey: I&#x27;ve been using scrubs my entire life and nothing compares to this one.  Using it now for 3 years and my teenage girls are now using it.  Just remember, as with all scrubs, be gentle.  We have a natural tendency to want to really scrub with a scrub :) AND a little goes a long way.  Use on dry skin for extra polishing.</li>
    <li> i do not know if it is the real product. The original one should have had a thermal effect that is when you apply, it is supposed to create a warmth a reaction that peels the dead skin . i wasted my Money buying it through amazon, I should have gone directly to the dermalogica. This is for my mother and it is her review</li>
    <li> This an excellent exfoliant.  The beads are somewhat fine so they don&#x27;t grate on the skin but you can feel the abrasion taking off that top layer.  I think it works best on dry skin and I use a wet wash cloth to rub it around my face after I start dry with just my finger tips.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s even better than I expected. My skin hasn&#x27;t felt so great in years.</li>
    <li> These doesn&#x27;t heat as well as the package claims, but it does have a gentle grit.  Overall I am pleased with this product.  I use it once a week (sensitive skin) and it does well.  Dull skin transformed into glowing skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Dermalogica products for over 10 years.  I first bought Multivitamin Thermafoliant from the student store at the Dermal Institute (where I have attended classes).  The product I received from Amazon was authentic at a competitive price.  This home care product exfoliates the skin without creating dryness.  The warming affect of the product helps the healthy ingredients penetrate the skin.  My skin feels very smooth after use.  I find that using it twice a week is sufficient for my skin condition :)</li>
    <li> Agree with the other positive reviews.  I use my fingers to give my face a gentle massage with this product, and then wet my fingers more to &#x27;melt&#x27; more products onto my face as I keep gently massaging.  The result is a very smooth face with pores tightened, but not in an uncomfortable way.  I also leave the product on my face a  little longer to let the &#x27;vitamins&#x27; sink in.  Good to use in the shower because I like to get the little exfoliating beads all off.</li>
    <li> exfoliates very nicely and makes my skin feel soft. I use it several times a week and have noticed smoother skin.</li>
    <li> I used it twice a week. It works really good on my skin. I feel my skin much better than before.</li>
    <li> All Dermalogica products are great.  I especially love the texture of this one, the way it feels on my face.  It kinda heats up ...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading all of the 5-star reviews, and to be honest, it&#x27;s good, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s not absolute best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied the product to my skin, I wasn&#x27;t expecting the warming sensation that followed.  That caught me a bit off-guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be used on lightly damp skin for maximum effect.  Using it in the shower will lessen the exfoliating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of facial exfoliators and most of them are average (at best) or they just don&#x27;t work.  [[ASIN:B003RCZNZU Mary Kay TimeWise Microdermabrasion Step 1: Refine]] is the one I personally recommend.  I&#x27;m open to trying new products, but I always go back to Mary Kay.  It works the best for me.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  When you put it on your face it &amp;#34;heats&amp;#34; and has gentle beads that clean your face.  Your skin feels clean and soft.</li>
