      <li>Mostly.</li>
      <li>In searching for a replacement, I was looking to see if there&#x27;s anything better out there and decided to try this Revlon.  </li>
      <li>It just seems the off position would be better placed at either the top or bottom of the slide bar.</li>

      <li>The retractable cord makes it easy to store and easy to pack when travelling.</li>

      <li>For someone with fine hair it may work fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s HUGE.</li>
      <li>The diffuser is also by Revlon and the diffuser doesn&#x27;t fit on the dryer.</li>

      <li>I stopped using it and let it cool off.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this item from amazon, I loved this hair dryer but it only worked for 3 months before it quit.  </li>
      <li>Great little hair dryer for the price.  </li>
      <li>For the money, it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t worth the pain of returning.</li>
      <li>My old hair dryer was several years old and had given me excellent service.  </li>
      <li>The second day or so, it started turning off on its own while in use.</li>
      <li>The retractable cord and folding handle are nice, but I&#x27;d rather have a quiet hairdryer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it to have to replace it every couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This hair dryer gets really super hot.  </li>
      <li>The previous one I had was pretty good</li>
      <li>I tried different outlets, pressing the test and reset buttons many times, nothing.</li>
      <li>So the seller must be aware of it.</li>
      <li>It changed fan speed on its own, every once in a while it would increase out of nowhere and then go back to normal</li>
      <li>First one of those I&#x27;ve owned, too.  </li>
      <li>I just followed the recommendation, feeling safe that certainly that and the fact that the same manufacturer made the darn things that they would work together.</li>
      <li>There is nothing essentially wrong with this hair dryer, and I&#x27;m sure it will give me good years of service</li>
      <li>both sound and feel exactly the same.</li>
      <li>It only has one switch with hot/off/low, which is easy to maneuver and doesn&#x27;t stick.</li>
      <li>Loudest hair dryer have ever heard and handle is too large to hold on to fully.</li>
      <li>A  partial refund would be given plus I would have to pay S&amp;H, I would of liked an option to just return it for a new one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the retractable cord dryers, since they allow me to keep my storage space a little neater.</li>
      <li>dryer 5 stars is I feel the &#x27;high&#x27; setting is too hot.</li>
      <li>I noticed that my hair dresser&#x27;s &#x27;professional&#x27; dryer doesn&#x27;t &#x27;blow&#x27; but puts out very gentle hot air.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>This hairdryer works really well.</li>
      <li>I saw it was still available, but decided to try something different this time.  </li>
      <li>but the sound is very similar to metal blades screaching in your ears!  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say the ionic thing really does anything for my hair either.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for a couple weeks now and really like it.  </li>
      <li>High powered and also folds for making travel easier!</li>
      <li>I need a dryer that can stand up to the work I put it through to get my hair smoothed and straight.</li>
      <li>The hot setting is too hot and I have to hold it far away from my hair.</li>
      <li>I previously used Conair 260PX and was happy with it until it broke not too long ago.  </li>
      <li>Since my last one probably died due to filter dust over the years, this is a good feature.</li>
      <li>It has a flimsy feel to it and if you push the cool burst button, the dryer goes to very low speed.   </li>
      <li>so I had to go buy a whole new hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>Purchased mainly for the retractable cord.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the high frequency whine that can ruin</li>
      <li>but then the high heat setting broke after a month.</li>
      <li>This one seems a little more sturdy in that area.  </li>
      <li>I really like it so far.  </li>
      <li>I could tell my current retractable-cord hairdryer (not Revlon brand) was ending its useful life.</li>
      <li>Folds down to an easily packable size, retracts well.  </li>
      <li>They will not just send me a new part.  </li>
      <li>But not really all that pleased with the overall performance of it.</li>
      <li>Very loud.</li>
      <li>Everytime one wants to change the position from low to high heat output or vice versa, the off position is ill-placed right in the middle of the slide bar.</li>
      <li>I rarely blow dry my hair but this thing is really ridiculously loud it makes my baby cry!</li>
      <li>This dryer is loud, very loud.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always trying to find one that isn&#x27;t loud, or dries faster, or has a longer cord.</li>
      <li>I noticed this hairdryer was extremely loud.  </li>
      <li>but WHY is this made so loud?  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The dryer works but doesn&#x27;t have solid feeling handling it.  Cord winder is not as usefull for everyday use. Actually, it makes dryer bigger and less solid. Noise level is high compare to other dryer.  Ceramic, I didn&#x27;t noticed if it is installed. This should be less than $20 all things considered.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Loudest hair dryer have ever heard and handle is too large to hold on to fully. I rarely blow dry my hair but this thing is really ridiculously loud it makes my baby cry! Tried to return but missed return date by a day.</li>
    <li> Almost perfect. This hair dryer is the best.     The only minor things I would change is the annoying 3-position temperature slide bar that has the off position in the middle, the low position on top, and the high position on the bottom. It just seems the off position would be better placed at either the top or bottom of the slide bar. Everytime one wants to change the position from low to high heat output or vice versa, the off position is ill-placed right in the middle of the slide bar. Annoying but workable.     The latter item would be that while the cord is definitely long enough, there is warning not to pass pulling the cord out beyond a colored stripe. It would be helpful to have a pre-warning stripe since the only way to find out where the warning stripe is located is to pull the cord out too far. Oops! So, once a person discovers the maximum length that the cord should be pulled out to by pulling it out too far, it&#x27;s too late. However, despite the warning, it didn&#x27;t hurt the product to do this - at least not the one time it happened.     The wonderful features to fold this product for easy portability, the retractable cord, and its excellent drying ability, all far outweigh the two mentioned minor annoyances.</li>
    <li> This dryer is very good.  I was very happy to discover that not only is the cord retractable, but the hand folds into the unit.  Good price and good product.</li>
    <li> The retractable cord and foldable handle is really great, although I haven&#x27;t had the need to carry it around yet. The size is slightly big, but it&#x27;s not too bad. After using this to dry my hair, my hair seems to feel a bit softer. The only bad thing is the high-low-off slider on the handle. The position is fine, but sometimes it is hard to push the slider, which gets annoying sometimes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the retractable cord dryers, since they allow me to keep my storage space a little neater. Also am a fan of the ceramic/ionic units as they do seem to make a bit of a difference for my hair. This dryer works really well, including the ability to (almost) fully retract the cord and fold the unit in half for storage. But I have to give it a little ding in the overall rating because the concentrator attachment does not fit properly and is difficult to use because it falls off repeatedly.</li>
    <li> I go through hair dryers like crazy...I&#x27;m always trying to find one that isn&#x27;t loud, or dries faster, or has a longer cord. I&#x27;ve definitely found the right one at last. This dryer is surprisingly light, and I love the retractable cord on it. It only has one switch with hot/off/low, which is easy to maneuver and doesn&#x27;t stick. It has a cold shot button, also. I think this dryer dries my hair a little faster than previous models I&#x27;ve tried, but there&#x27;s not much difference. I love that it&#x27;s so light...it keeps your arms from getting tired as fast.</li>
    <li> All hairdryers are loud, however this one seems worse than most.  It has a flimsy feel to it and if you push the cool burst button, the dryer goes to very low speed.   The cord does retact better than most I have tried.</li>
    <li> Revelon always has great products and this hair dryer, is just a good enough weight for the size, the retractable cord is fantastic..but WHY is this made so loud?  I do NOT recommond drying  your hair near pets, or using this on a child&#x27;s hair.  It works really well but the sound is very similar to metal blades screaching in your ears!  Not even exagerating.  Very loud.</li>
    <li> Great hair blower. Have used it for over 2 years and it still work great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for a couple weeks now and really like it.  It gives all the power of a full-size dryer with the portability that I want.  It&#x27;s a great dryer and a good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer simply due to the retractable cord.  I was tired of how sloppy the dryers looked with the cords wrapped around.  Well, the cord does retract...kinda.  The last six inches or so has to be pushed back into the unit.  I would return it but it isn&#x27;t worth the hassle when that is my only complaint.  For the money, it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Update (April 2015): 4 years later, the dryer works as well as the day I got it. Few products last this long these days.  2+ years later, the dryer works as well as the day I got it - even the retractable cord. This dryer has outlasted every other dryer I&#x27;ve had. Every once in a while the cord gets stuck and doesn&#x27;t retract all the way but always works itself out after being pulled out a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Great little hair dryer for the price.  Folds down to an easily packable size, retracts well.  Only negative comment is that you really have to apply some force to the difuser to get it to stay on, but once you do it  you kinda get the hang of it. . . Slam!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer with the recommended Ceramic diffuser-- web site noted specific items frequently purchased together.The diffuser is also by Revlon and the diffuser doesn&#x27;t fit on the dryer. I am so frustrated by this. Amazon recommended this combo--gave a discounted price, if bought together, etc. I just followed the recommendation, feeling safe that certainly that and the fact that the same manufacturer made the darn things that they would work together. Nope, not happening. Back it goes--I even paid extra for expedited shipping. I won&#x27;t be listening to any recommendations from you guys in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer as a backup. I could tell my current retractable-cord hairdryer (not Revlon brand) was ending its useful life. So I had this one on standby for when my old one failed.  Of course it failed approximately 1 month and 5 days from when I ordered this new one.  When I opened the &amp;#34;brand new&amp;#34; box and plugged it in, I noticed this hairdryer was extremely loud.  After reading the manual I realized the &amp;#34;removable end cap&amp;#34; was not included in the box and was not on the hairdryer.  With that piece missing, it makes the hairdryer screechy loud.  I was 5 days past eligibility for returning it to Amazon and even though it is under warranty, I have to pay to have it shipped to Helen of Troy (Revlon) to get a new one.  They will not just send me a new part.  Plus, I&#x27;ll have to be without the hairdryer for however long that process takes.  Quality control needs to step up their game!</li>
    <li> The retractable cord and fold up handle are good for storing the hair dryer, since I don&#x27;t use it every day.  The airflow concentrator attachment doesn&#x27;t attach, but fortunately I don&#x27;t need it.  Overall I am happy with this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> 15 years ago I was given (at my request) a Revlon \\&quot;Get Quiet 1875\\&quot; hairdryer.  It gave excellent QUIET service for 15 years before it died.  When I had to replace it I went looking for another Revlon and was shocked to not find even one that was \\&quot;quiet\\&quot;.  I bought this one hoping that \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; was now so standard it wasn&#x27;t mentioned; wrong.  It is very loud, although my daughter tells me it is no louder than average.  There is no discernible difference between the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting and the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting, both sound and feel exactly the same. As mentioned elsewhere, the slider control is difficult to work, another change for the worse.  The one advantage this one has over my old one is the removable cover over the back filter. Since my last one probably died due to filter dust over the years, this is a good feature. The retractable cord and folding handle are nice, but I&#x27;d rather have a quiet hairdryer.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this hair dryer 5 stars is I feel the &#x27;high&#x27; setting is too hot. I have to hold it at arm&#x27;s length so that I don&#x27;t burn my hair. Using the &#x27;low&#x27; setting is quite hot enough to dry my very long hair in a reasonable period. My only other quibble is this dryer has a comparatively long nozzle. A shorter nozzle might make it easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good aspects:&lt;br /&gt;- The hot air it puts out doesn&#x27;t blow so hard to flip my hair around making knots and mess. I noticed that my hair dresser&#x27;s &#x27;professional&#x27; dryer doesn&#x27;t &#x27;blow&#x27; but puts out very gentle hot air.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t have the high frequency whine that can ruin hearing.&lt;br /&gt;- It has a cover over the air intake so it should be easier to clean the lint although lint still gets through&lt;br /&gt;- It comes with a concentrator&lt;br /&gt;- The wire retractor is still working (after about a month of use)</li>
    <li> It works great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s HUGE. Why even make the handle fold? There are smaller models without folding handles that work as well - and really are less bulky.</li>
    <li> Dryer does a good job.  I find it to be a little clumsy -- top heavy.  Also, the retractable cord needs some coaxing to rewind but is still a good feature.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer gets really super hot.  I have to change the angle of my hand because it burns it.  It doesn&#x27;t lay flat on the counter, either, so be careful as it can fall/roll/slip off.  This is the first hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned where I was aware/learned about the cold button for use to keep the style in place but this one doesn&#x27;t get very cold.  Having not used it in other dryers, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s an issue with this one or not.  The cord retractor seems like it will break soon.  My last one, the handle broke so that it wouldn&#x27;t stay locked in the open position.  This one seems a little more sturdy in that area.  I can&#x27;t say the ionic thing really does anything for my hair either.  First one of those I&#x27;ve owned, too.  Don&#x27;t know why they make them in all these awful colors that don&#x27;t match any bathroom decor, so I was happy to find a black one.  But not really all that pleased with the overall performance of it.</li>
    <li> Purchased mainly for the retractable cord.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose but a little louder than I would want.  I don&#x27;t use on a daily basis but wanted one for my guest bath.</li>
    <li> I have owned this dryer for about two years now and I have no complaints. It has a good feel in hand while you are using it. The weight is well balanced and the dryer is compact, but not too small. The buttons feel solid and work as they should (even though some people complain about the orientation of the on/off). I especially like that the cord is long enough to have freedom of movement, but still retracts into the handle for easy storage. I have traveled with this dryer and it holds up to frequent trips. I do not think that this dryer is especially noisy compared to other dryers I have owned in the past. As for drying speed, I have long thick hair and it manages to dry my hair in no time. If I need a second dryer or if this one dies (as all eventually do...) I will buy another Revlon RVDR5012.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Revlon with a retractable cord.  My first dryer lasted over 4 years!!!!!  The retractable cord makes it easy to store and easy to pack when travelling.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer works really well. Only, I bought it to take on a trip and it would have half filled my suitcase it&#x27;s so large, so I left it behind. I would not call this a travel iron though it has dual power. Also, the handle is not very comfortable.</li>
    <li> High powered and also folds for making travel easier! Various heat/cool settings/power make this versatile for all hair types!</li>
    <li> I previously used Conair 260PX and was happy with it until it broke not too long ago.  In searching for a replacement, I was looking to see if there&#x27;s anything better out there and decided to try this Revlon.  In summary, the must have criteria I was looking for: ionic ceramic, retractable cord, folding handle, at least 1875 W, dual voltage. My additional preferred criteria: lightweight and not loud.    With this Revlon, I got all of my must have and the lightweight.  The loudness is about the same as my previous Conair, so at least it&#x27;s not worse.  I really like it so far.  It dries my hair quickly, leaving it smooth with no frizz.  The retractable cord works great.  To me, it&#x27;s very similar to the Conair, but this one is cheaper.  I didn&#x27;t give this 5 star because I do wish the noise level could be less, but it&#x27;s a hair dryer, not a fan, so I understand the noise.</li>
    <li> Before I start, I will say that this hair dryer did have a long way to travel to get to me, it is entirely possible that it got knocked around during shipping and that is what resulted in it being useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this in the mail, it worked. Mostly. It changed fan speed on its own, every once in a while it would increase out of nowhere and then go back to normal, I thought maybe this was a pulse function I didn&#x27;t know about. The second day or so, it started turning off on its own while in use. Not long after that, it stopped turning on at all. I tried different outlets, pressing the test and reset buttons many times, nothing. The cord won&#x27;t even retract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it may be the journey that ruined this hair dryer, but as far as my limited experience with it goes I would never purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from amazon, I loved this hair dryer but it only worked for 3 months before it quit.  A  partial refund would be given plus I would have to pay S&amp;H, I would of liked an option to just return it for a new one.</li>
    <li> Perfect hair dryer. Does what is intended and it. Has retractible cord which so convenient!!</li>
    <li> very poor airflow, and the concentrator was missing from the broken manufacturer box it came in. The outside packaging was not damaged at all. So I have to assume it was missing when shipped. So the seller must be aware of it. wasn&#x27;t worth the pain of returning. I guess it could be used as a short trip travel dryer. Maybe the concentrator would make it more effective? It also has poor heat level. If you have thick hair don&#x27;t waste your money. For someone with fine hair it may work fine.</li>
    <li> This was a backup that became the regular dryer. Liked it even better that than the original. Great product.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing. I have really long thick hair and with most dryers it take at least 30 minutes. This dryer is hotter and blows harder. I love it! Great for the price and the fact that it folds and has a retractable cord is a huge plus!!</li>
    <li> Like the hair dryer but the cord reel is weak and does not completely retract. Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer was several years old and had given me excellent service.  I saw it was still available, but decided to try something different this time.  It has the features I have become spoiled by, the retractable cord and the handle that folds up.  The drying power doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as my older one.  I was hoping that after several years of advancements in technology I would get a better unit and have many wonderful things to say about it here.  There is nothing essentially wrong with this hair dryer, and I&#x27;m sure it will give me good years of service, I just wish I had ordered the one I had before, as I feel it may have be a superior product compared to this one.</li>
    <li> This dryer is loud, very loud.  The hot setting is too hot and I have to hold it far away from my hair. The slider buttons are sometimes difficult.  I don&#x27;t use the folding feature and the retractable cord works at times.  I purchased from Target less than a year ago and used once or twice a week for 40 minutes, all other times was to do a quick 5 minute dry on my curls.  Yesterday, the dryer smelled as if it was about to burn.  Literally like fire.  I stopped using it and let it cool off.  I tried again this morning and it smelled like smoke/fire again.  I have a slightly older Revlon dryer that is really quiet (the \\&quot;1875 Quiet Ceramic\\&quot;) but it is clunky and heavy and the attachment did not stay on. It also takes long to dry my hair, but I will have to use it until I buy another new dryer. I won&#x27;t buy Revlon again. I wish I could find the big yellow ones that were used in the salons back in the days.  I used to have one and loved it. Not sure who made it.  Revlon used to be good,  they don&#x27;t make products the way they used to.</li>
    <li> It was ok at first but then the high heat setting broke after a month. The low setting barely dries my hair so I had to go buy a whole new hair dryer.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace one of the same model in a different color.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, no seriously, very thick hair and it is fairly long and coarse. I need a dryer that can stand up to the work I put it through to get my hair smoothed and straight. The previous one I had was pretty good and I loved the retractable cord. So much that I wanted another.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this one is 20 days past being able to return and a piece from the folding mechanism in the handle (which I also love) has broken off inside the dryer and makes a horrible noise when I turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping I can figure out how to get it out since learning I cannot return it :(&lt;br /&gt;This is a great dryer for the price. The way I use them it&#x27;s worth it to have to replace it every couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried more expensive dryers (with promises of faster drying) and was not the least impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#x27;m sad I have a broken dryer, I have to say I do recommend this one and would (will) buy another if I can&#x27;t get mine fixed!</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised; no issues.</li>
