<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion!! I ran across it leaving the spa and immediately looked it up to purchase it. I have dry and calloused hands and feet and this loton does so much better moisturizing than the lotions I have now.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion but was disappointed after spending almost $20 for it the pump did not work. When you push down on it nothing comes out. So I have to remove it to get the lotion out, very inconvenient. Amazon was excellent about getting back to me but unfortunately they were not able to send me a replacement pump so they did give me a 20% credit back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a facial moisturizer, and it is perhaps the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  My face feels silky and moist all day.  When you compare it to other facial moisturizers, it&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
    <li> Lotion was spilling out of the top of the bottle when I opened the package.  Once I took the plastic off and tried the pump it was apparent the pump was broken.  I like the lotion but am frustrated that I have to deal with the broken pump.</li>
    <li> I got this stuff for my girlfriend...I remembered she had mentioned how much she liked it. Apparently the Amazon deal is pretty good....at least better than we can get locally. Never the less she loves it. It seems this stuff is really high quality and she really likes it. For what it&#x27;s worth, she&#x27;s really smart.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion through amazon after paying a lot for it at a high end spa.  It arrived with a broken pump, but the seller replaced it.  For some reason, the lotion does not quite smell like the lotion that I purchased from the spa.  It is still creamy &amp; moisturizing, but I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  I will keep buying it from the spa.  \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;  :(</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite lotion and scent.  It is clean and milky and richly thick.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it was a great gift for my wife. It has a thick consistancy and she says it is very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! The smell is amazing and it soaks in without a greasy feel. I give these as Christmas presents and this is what they hope for every year after!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came with a refillable option&lt;br /&gt;the price is a bit high, it is like 25.00 with out shipping at Bumble Lane</li>
    <li> I love this well made product. Creamy awesome lotion, smells sooo fragerant &amp; awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I got it for my wife, but enjoy it myself. Non-greasy and leaves hands feeling very soft</li>
    <li> clean, fresh scent; good price</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It smells so nice and always makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for quite a few years and I LOVE it!! It is one of my favorite scents and I am complimented on the scent all the time. It isn&#x27;t too greasy or too strong.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion.  Good delivery</li>
    <li> I love the scent, clean and fresh! Good moisturizer without being greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> This body lotion&#x27;s smell is so calming! It&#x27;s not greasy and the moisture lasts the entire day. I&#x27;ll never use a different lotion again! My all-time favorite!</li>
    <li> This smell is to die for and the quality of the lotion is unsurpassed!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  Feels awesome without being greasy.  Smells heavenly.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, no issues</li>
    <li> I am keeping the lotion as I really like it.  However, it is the second one we have purchased (one through Amazon, the other at a store) and both times, the pump does not work.</li>
    <li> was a copycat, not original  lotion in bottle do not buy.</li>
    <li> Love it. best cream ever!</li>
    <li> Expensive but I love the fragrance,  I just use it for special occasions.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion before and love the light feel and delicate smell.&lt;br /&gt;My friends love to receive this product as gifts.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite lotion..So worth the money..Just wish they would offer a bulk price so that I could buy for the whole family.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this after smelling it on my sister at a local massage center and loved it.  When I ran out, I found out it was cheaper to get it from Amazon where I could get 2 bottles at a time.  I won&#x27;t ever run out now and I will always smell good.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion ever!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion! Everyone that borrows mine has to get some for themselves. Only problem it that is hard to find!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Love the texture.  Love that my favorite lotion comes in a gigantic bottle.  And I love that I can get it within two days with my prime membership.  Can we make this a subscription item please??</li>
    <li> This lotion is very good for moisturizing but smell is so so.&lt;br /&gt;I like this strong  container.&lt;br /&gt;overall i like this.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion--I love the feel and the aroma!</li>
    <li> i really like the fragrance of this lotion. It helped me relax. I liked the way it made you skin feel too without a sticky feeling like other lotions.</li>
    <li> One of the two bottles arrived at my house busted :(  there was a huge lotion mess all over the box..</li>
    <li> great scent and very good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years and just discovered I can get it through Amazon. It has a nice clean light fragrance that lasts all day. It is a great moisturizer that works well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Oat Milk Body Lotion for years. People ask me all the time about what lotion I wear because it makes me smell so nice.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for at least 10 years.  This is the best lotion I have found.  Effective and smells wonderful.  A little pricey, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Sampled this (Oat Milk Body) lotion at my hair salon and loved it, but not the price they were asking for it. Found the exact same stuff here on Amazon at 25-30% less cost. Arrived promptly, well-packaged and is great stuff. Goes on nice and light...not heavy, sticky feeling to it and leaves a subtle and pretty-smelling scent for hours after application. I like to wear cologne daily and the scent of this lotion does not interfere at all with the scent of my cologne or perfume. Highly-recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my mom. She has really dry skin and loves it so much! The smell is strong if you dont like that I&#x27;d choose something else. Feels so nice on your skin</li>
    <li> You will love the clean scent of this rich moisturizing lotion!  Expensive? Not really - it&#x27;s worth it due to the smaller amount of great-smelling lotion required to moisturize skin without being greasy.  You will not regret buying this Oat Milk Body lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body cream for a long time, I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Love all the archipelago products!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, I use it everyday. There&#x27;s hardly a smell, which I prefer, and my skin is a fan.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is an expensive lotion... But it is so worth it! I love the scent; it stays with me all day. This lotion is thick but not greasy. It is a treat to apply in the morning. Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> Expensive, but smells and feels awesome. Not greasy. Blends well. Makes skin noticeably smoother in just days. I thought it was weird that the dispenser bottle is metal, and it left somewhat of a metallic/alcohol smell the first few times I used it. But those smells faded after use and it doesn&#x27;t happen anymore. Highly recommended. I think the price is worth it considering the quality... and that I won&#x27;t be buying anymore of that cheap drug store or highly perfumed Victoria Secret lotion anymore. Those products just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance of this product.  And it softens your skin so nice.  Am happy to be able to purchase it so easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years. It is a little pricey, but if you are in need of a good lotion with a mild scent, this is the best I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s thick and creamy but never greasy. A little goes a long way. The scent is wonderful. It&#x27;s clean and subtle, never overwhelming. I keep it by the bathroom sink and everyone who uses it will ask me about it and where I bought it. Makes an excellent gift too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I love it....so does everyone one else who smells the clean essence</li>
    <li> Dry weather really messes with my skin and living in Southern California means I experience that a lot. This product moisturizes great and the fragrance is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I am in love with all of the Archipelago products but this lotion has to be my favorite. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but living in the desert I tend to splurge on moisturizers. The smell is wonderful and because of the thickness the lotion lasts much longer than you would think. I would try to catch it when it first becomes available from the seller, as it tends to fluctuate in price quite a bit. Either way it&#x27;s definitely worth the money and amazon is the best place to buy because of the free shipping.</li>
    <li> bottle was 2-3 &#x27;&#x27; empty</li>
    <li> Smells like heaven!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is nice and thick and creamy. Really feels good on my skin with a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Archipelago Botanicals Oat Milk Body Lotion is not only awesome smelling it has something in it that helps releive redness on skin.  My 11 year old daughter is now addicted to using it as well.  Good thing it comes in large bottles.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and love this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d use it just for the smell, but the bonus is that it&#x27;s one of the few that actually works on my chicken skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products.  One minor problem this time, the can was dented.  I was a little dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I buy this for all of the women in the family for Christmas and we all love it.  Sometimes the pump on the container does not work well.</li>
    <li> An absolutely lovely lotion with a soft, unique scent..  So happy to find it; not widely available.</li>
    <li> The best body lotion - just amazing</li>
    <li> I tried this once many years ago and could never find it again.  The scent is amazingly clean, fresh, and light and it&#x27;s one of the few scented products I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction or an asthma attack.  This is my absolute most favorite lotion ever.</li>
    <li> smell so good，I like it！</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, -- love the scent, love the feel, love &amp;#34;the work&amp;#34; it does, but with one caveat:  the pump never engages too easily.</li>
    <li> Cans were 3/4 full and dented:(. Lotion is still great.</li>
    <li> smells amazing, doesnt leave your hands feeling greasy, but also works as great lotion. Keep it at my desk at work, thinking of getting one for home.</li>
    <li> The item was received dented in multiple spots and also was open with lotion spilled all over the place.  Because of the dents I was unable to give the item as a gift as originally planned.</li>
