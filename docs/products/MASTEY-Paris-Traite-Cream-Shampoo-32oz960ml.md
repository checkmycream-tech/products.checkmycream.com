      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, will continue to purchase....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost time for me to get some more</li>

      <li>I still LOVE this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s all I have to say but Amazon requires more words to post.</li>
      <li>and I still LOVE this Shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mastey for over 20 years now and it is definitely the best and gentlest out there.  </li>
      <li>Love the way it makes my hair look.  </li>
      <li>Lovely coconut scent.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I then tried Denorex (coal tar version), which worked ok, but then I smelled like a creosote soaked telephone pole.   </li>
      <li>Wish more shampoos took out sodium sulfates.</li>
      <li>Now, my hair always looks healthy and every hair dresser</li>
      <li>It cleans well, with clouds of soft foam, a clean and not overpowering scent, and is the best for color treated hair, doesn&#x27;t strip.  </li>
      <li>I have shoulder length, very baby fine brown hair, and I believe no matter what type of hair you have, the traite shampoo, and the moisturee conditioner, with a superpac treatment once a month, will keep anyone&#x27;s hair in great, healthy, shape.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect for dry, itchy skin.</li>
      <li>Washes out easily and leaves hair nice and clean.</li>
      <li>I buy the Smooth conditioner for one daughter whose hair tangles more and is more prone to damage.  </li>
      <li>I have a loose body wave in my hair, and it is working out perfectly, with these products.  </li>
      <li>AFM Safe Choice Shampoo, a fine product carried by Amazon, is one of them.</li>
      <li>So I was glad to find it available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I loved this product so much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using it, though it&#x27;s not always easy to find on the shelf</li>
      <li>Rinses out easily.  </li>
      <li>I have not been able to have great hair on the 2nd day without rewashing!!</li>
      <li>If it helps, my hair is extremely fine.</li>
      <li>Buy it by the quart, it&#x27;s a fabulous value.</li>
      <li>I recently started using this great product line when a friend gave me a sample of hers to try.</li>
      <li>a trip when nothing else was available</li>
      <li>Then there&#x27;s the added bonus of it being cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>I can get fragrance free from them, but I have to wait a month.</li>
      <li>Eliminates any itchy scalp (and seems to help baby scalps stay cradle-cap free).</li>
      <li>Thank You Mastey Products, and Amazon for having this available.  </li>
      <li>I also used it to wash personal clothing items - did a great job.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t even recommend a \\&quot;deep conditioner\\&quot; when I go in because they tell me my hair looks great</li>
      <li>and I need sulfate free shampoo</li>
      <li>Mastey is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works for me and also leaves my hair in great condition.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to order this shampoo from American Discount Beauty Supply, you will be pleased you did!!  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for 15 years and find no other shampoo to be as good as this one.  </li>
      <li>My hair was soft, and tangle-free (MOST important for retaining length)!</li>
      <li>My hair feels clean but not stripped.</li>
      <li>It not only leaves the hair clean - but also does wonders for the scalp - especially true for those who bleach and have \\&quot;scalp burn.\\&quot; &lt;br</li>
      <li>Hard to find but the best stuff around.</li>
      <li>It is sweet smell that lingers in your hair and on your hands.</li>
      <li>My favorite gentle shampoo for colored highlighted hair.</li>
      <li>Now it smells more like one of those perfumes that old ladies like my grandmother used to use!  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo but product was old.</li>
      <li>Its the best for dry hair and takes care of all the itches and dry skin flakiness.</li>
      <li>Mastey includes cocamidopropyl betaine in some of their products: On my bottle of Traite, it&#x27;s in the list of ingredients, right after their much-touted  sulfoalkyl amides and esters.    </li>
      <li>Besides being a trendsetter over 20 yrs ago with the Sulfate-free formula, Traite smells like fresh Pina Coladas, it&#x27;s low lathering (which is good, b/c lots of lather--which is ubercheap to produce--- does not make for clean hair, just the illusion), and totally non</li>
      <li>Mastey&#x27;s Frehair does not cause any of the oily problem, yet makes hair soft, silky and easy to brush/comb.  </li>
      <li>traite is a very mild moisturizing shampoo and even helped clear up my flaky/dry scalp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a gentle, yet moisturizing shampoo for my natural mostly 4a (4b (in the crown) hair.</li>
      <li>A very gentle shampoo.</li>
      <li>I JUST washed my hair with it for the first time on Sunday</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentler than even baby shampoos but feels so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for sensitive/color treated/dry hair and doubles as a body wash!</li>
      <li>My latest order arrived 2 days ago and with first use I could tell something was different.  </li>
      <li>It never fails to meet expectations.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Most conditioners left so much residue on your hair that it would have oil streaks.</li>
      <li>I started searching for a better product because a couple of years ago my hair started becoming really dull and brittle.</li>
      <li>I tried many different shampoos that claimed to be sulphate free, but my itchy, dry scalp wouldn&#x27;t change.</li>
      <li>Just soft and pretty!</li>
      <li>and this really helps it.  </li>

    <li> BUT the pump does NOT work....I wish it came without one.  I have had TWO bottles and neither pump worked! grrrrr</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly nice shampoo--if you don&#x27;t have an allergy to one of the most common surfactants (foaming agents) in personal cleansers.  Much has been made of the presumably nasty sulfate-based surfactants in shampoos, which are supposed to be damaging to the hair.  However, another one, cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) is generally overlooked as a troublemaker for the skin.  This is a surfactant that is present in almost every shampoo and liquid skin cleanser in America, including those made by Mastey, supposedly a leader in the field of unusually gentle, healthful shampoos.  Mastey includes cocamidopropyl betaine in some of their products: On my bottle of Traite, it&#x27;s in the list of ingredients, right after their much-touted  sulfoalkyl amides and esters.    In 2004, cocamidoproply betaine was named \\&quot;Allergen of the Year\\&quot; by the American Contact Dermatitis Society, noting its importance as an &#x27;emerging allergen&#x27; for children.  If you experience irritation of the scalp or face and can&#x27;t figure out what&#x27;s wrong, it&#x27;s worth considering that CAPB in your shampoo might be the culprit, especially if you have sensitive skin.   Yet, when you go shopping, just try to find one single shampoo, even a baby or &#x27;natural&#x27; shampoo, where this stuff is not listed among the first three or four ingredients.    In the American marketplace, there are only three or four shampoos without CAPB, and it&#x27;s necessary to go to health food stores or Amazon to find them--if you know their names.  AFM Safe Choice Shampoo, a fine product carried by Amazon, is one of them.</li>
    <li> Been using this shampoo since the mid-80&#x27;s.  Had some dandruff problems and my hairdresser recommended it.  Gentle with no build up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years! I use it on my dogs! It&#x27;s fabulous! Sulfate-free. I would recommend it to anyone. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I use it to wash my face with as well, it is so gentle. It is perfect for dry, itchy skin. Has kept my facial eczema at bay for 25 years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for 35 years and will never change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mastey for over 20 years now and it is definitely the best and gentlest out there.  For years I thought I had dandruff because of flaking and itchy scalp only to find that it was really just allergies to the harsh products most companies use.  Mastey is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works for me and also leaves my hair in great condition.  Everyone should use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a gentle, yet moisturizing shampoo for my natural mostly 4a (4b (in the crown) hair. I was browsing at Marshall&#x27;s and came across Traite Cream Shampoo...for $5.99/16oz! I liked the consistency and the ingredient list, for the most part, so I decided to purchase it. I JUST washed my hair with it for the first time on Sunday and I LOVE it! My hair was soft, and tangle-free (MOST important for retaining length)! I&#x27;m going to go back to Marshall&#x27;s to see if it&#x27;s there but if it&#x27;s not I will DEFINITELY come on here and purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo since I first posted my above review, and it STILL gets my vote. I wash once a week and I love the fact that I can run my fingers through my coils DURING AND AFTER shampoo! That has NEVER happened before. I have not had any allergic reactions or dry scalp. My hair feels clean but not stripped. It&#x27;s almost time for me to get some more and I will be purchasing it on Amazon... I have yet to see it at Marshall&#x27;s or TJMaxx again :(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Another update-4/17/11*** I still didn&#x27;t see it at Marshall&#x27;s or TJMAXX, but I did purchase this big bottle on Amazon. I used standard shipping and the package arrives in 3 days.I still LOVE this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Another Update- 7/10/2015*** I&#x27;ve tried a couple other Shamps and I still LOVE this Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I too have used this product for almost 20 years. I tried other saloon products but nothing has touched Mastey. When I was younger, I had very oily skin. Most conditioners left so much residue on your hair that it would have oil streaks. Mastey&#x27;s Frehair does not cause any of the oily problem, yet makes hair soft, silky and easy to brush/comb.  I have recommend Mastey&#x27;s products to several people. Those who bought it still use it.  The company makes a other products for other types of hair conditions. I buy the Smooth conditioner for one daughter whose hair tangles more and is more prone to damage.  Addition 9-20-2015   Traite has changed their masking fragrance which used to be a faint coconut smell that did not linger. I have allergic reactions to fragrances. Traite has changed to natural oil for their masking fragrance. It is sweet smell that lingers in your hair and on your hands. The company confirmed this way the shampoo smells different and has  different texture. I can get fragrance free from them, but I have to wait a month. When they make a new batch they get me a bottle of shampoo without the oil they use for masking fragrance. If fragrances are not an issue then it will make not difference. If it is a problem, go to mastey.com and contact the company. They do promptly response to emails.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for color treated haIr. I effectively brightens dullness caused my products as it cleans.</li>
    <li> Great for people who are allergic to sodium lauryl sulphate.  A lot of people have &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; like flakes, but it&#x27;s not really dandruff, they are just allergic to SLS.  I&#x27;ve been using Traite for years and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with dandruff or flakes since I started using it.  Who needs Head and Shoulders and that yucky smell??</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 15 years and find no other shampoo to be as good as this one.  I very highly recommend the shampoo and the supplier, American Discount Beauty Supply.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to order this shampoo from American Discount Beauty Supply, you will be pleased you did!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I recently started using this great product line when a friend gave me a sample of hers to try. She has used Mastey \\&quot;forever\\&quot; and her recommendation was based on the great condition of her own lovely locks. After using it for a few weeks, I really noticed how much healthier my hair is. So did my friends. I wear my hair long, and perm it often. On a recent trip to Hawaii - going from ocean (with a quick cold water rinsing) to shopping to dinner in the same afternoon, my hair looked great! I also have numerous skin allergies and Mastey products have not triggered any allergic reactions. I urge all to try the products for themselves. I believe you will be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;DONT ORDER from Glamour Beauty!!!! Got Mastey product that was 8 yrs old and now all my hair is breaking off at the roots. they refused to refund my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, it&#x27;s amazingly good shampoo. Gentle and excellent. Eliminates any itchy scalp (and seems to help baby scalps stay cradle-cap free).</li>
    <li> I have been using Traite Shampoo for over 20 years.  There is no better shampoo, regardless of price.  It is so good that you can even use it as a face cleanser.  It not only leaves the hair clean - but also does wonders for the scalp - especially true for those who bleach and have \\&quot;scalp burn.\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On a trip when nothing else was available I also used it to wash personal clothing items - did a great job.</li>
    <li> I can use this and the next day my hair is not greasy!! Just soft and pretty! I have not been able to have great hair on the 2nd day without rewashing!!</li>
    <li> The best sulfate-free shampoo on the market.  Difficult to find in stores, so I order it here.  Nice pleasant scent and cream like texture. Washes out easily and leaves hair nice and clean. A very gentle shampoo.</li>
    <li> Lovely coconut scent.  Lathers nicely.  Rinses out easily.  Took away one star since you do need to use a conditioner afterwards.  Wish more shampoos took out sodium sulfates.</li>
    <li> Besides being a trendsetter over 20 yrs ago with the Sulfate-free formula, Traite smells like fresh Pina Coladas, it&#x27;s low lathering (which is good, b/c lots of lather--which is ubercheap to produce--- does not make for clean hair, just the illusion), and totally non stripping-- it&#x27;s gentler than even baby shampoos but feels so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for sensitive/color treated/dry hair and doubles as a body wash! i mean, what more could you ask for? I always stock up on this whenever i find it, and since it&#x27;s so hard to find, the exclusivity makes it even more lustworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try it, just buy it.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s the best word to describe how my hair feels after using this shampoo. I have very dry hair and this shampoo keeps it from looking so dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> I too have been using Traite for nearly 20 years.   When I was a kid I had to use Sebulex or I&#x27;d get horrible dandruff.   But I was never too crazy about Sebulex, though I used it for years.  Every once in awhile I&#x27;d branch out and try something like Head and Shoulders, and it immediately turned on the snowfall after one usage.   I then tried Denorex (coal tar version), which worked ok, but then I smelled like a creosote soaked telephone pole.   Later they switched to salicylic acid (the same stuff in wart remover).   Somehow all that did not inspire confidence.    While visiting a friend though, I had the occasion to try Traite, and really liked how my hair looked, felt, smelled and there were no flakes or scalp itch.   I&#x27;m still using it, though it&#x27;s not always easy to find on the shelf I&#x27;ll order it by the gallon now and then and refill some of my old 32oz containers.   A little pricey, even when bought by the gallon, but if I can I&#x27;ll be using it as long as I still have hair.</li>
    <li> This is a light shampoo that can be used everyday on colored hair. Light smell of coconut,  does not leave a heavy residue on hair, I use it to wash as a body wash, no drying soap.</li>
    <li> I do not use conditioner with this shampoo. I have much less hair loss since using it. I wash my hair every 2nd day.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on the way my hair looks. I have tried every saloon shampoo on the market and often get a itchy scalp from it. Not with Mastey.</li>
    <li> My favorite gentle shampoo for colored highlighted hair. That&#x27;s all I have to say but Amazon requires more words to post.</li>
    <li> It is a creme shampoo which doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of it&#x27;s essential oils and helps with the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the creme rinse, it works well.</li>
    <li> I get the keratin done and I need sulfate free shampoo, it makes my hair feel wonderful .  Recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Everything was good to go!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair shampoo!  I tend to have a dry scalp and this shampoo really cuts down on the itching.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It cleans well, with clouds of soft foam, a clean and not overpowering scent, and is the best for color treated hair, doesn&#x27;t strip.  Buy it by the quart, it&#x27;s a fabulous value.</li>
    <li> i have used traite for many years...it was recommended to me by a stylist in LA years ago. unfortunately it is not available in NYC where i live so i have to find it online. traite is a very mild moisturizing shampoo and even helped clear up my flaky/dry scalp. i have very sensitive skin and my skin likes traite so much i have even used it as a body and face wash.also seems to not have an issue with color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction...Great product.</li>
    <li> lt was what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started buying Mastey Traite Sulphate-Free Shampoo I have refused to try any other shampoo. I have tried many shampoos, even the professional, expensive ones that claim to be \\&quot;sulphate-free\\&quot; even though they have milder forms of sulphates in them. I started searching for a better product because a couple of years ago my hair started becoming really dull and brittle. I also developed a really dry and itchy scalp and dandruff. I tried many different shampoos that claimed to be sulphate free, but my itchy, dry scalp wouldn&#x27;t change. My hair looked terribly unhealthy. When I started using Mastey my hair quickly changed and my scalp stopped itching and was no longer dry. Now, my hair always looks healthy and every hair dresser I&#x27;ve gone to since I&#x27;ve switched to Mastey has commented on my hair. They don&#x27;t even recommend a \\&quot;deep conditioner\\&quot; when I go in because they tell me my hair looks great AND I even blow dry it every day. This product really has been a life saver. It may seem expensive, but it lasts a really, really long time. Also, it doesn&#x27;t really foam, which some people don&#x27;t like, but you don&#x27;t need to use that much; with just a small amount your hair will look and feel clean. If it helps, my hair is extremely fine.</li>
    <li> Have used this product since 1978!!!!  Continue to get compliments from strangers about the shine and condition of my hair.  This is a wonderful product . . . one of the few that lives up to its advertising claims.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers, I have used Traite for long time, starting in 1983.  For many years it was only available in salons, and since I moved around the country a lot, I often found it hard to find.  Sometime ago I was able to buy it on the Mastey website but now no longer.  So I was glad to find it available on Amazon.  So why the one star?  My latest order arrived 2 days ago and with first use I could tell something was different.  Mainly, the smell is different now.  It used to be a pleasant subtle coconut-like scent.  Now it smells more like one of those perfumes that old ladies like my grandmother used to use!  I compared the ingredients to those listed on my previous purchase and saw that some of them have changed also.  What&#x27;s happened?  Is this like what happened to Old Spice (got sold to a holding company, ingredients changed to increase profits, product suffers as a result)?</li>
    <li> Love this product, will continue to purchase....</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it on my face and arms and legs in addition to my hair.  I have dry flaky skin and this really helps it.  And it smells great (kind of coconutty.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years.  Its the best for dry hair and takes care of all the itches and dry skin flakiness.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this shampoo for 20 years. It never fails to meet expectations.&lt;br /&gt;One negative comment. The pumps that they make for the big bottles are lousy--usually breaking before the bottle is half done.</li>
    <li> I, too, used Mastey products when I was much younger.  I loved this product so much.  I have shoulder length, very baby fine brown hair, and I believe no matter what type of hair you have, the traite shampoo, and the moisturee conditioner, with a superpac treatment once a month, will keep anyone&#x27;s hair in great, healthy, shape.  I have a loose body wave in my hair, and it is working out perfectly, with these products.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I can use my blow dryer on low, and my curling iron on low, and get the loose body waves I love.  Thank You Mastey Products, and Amazon for having this available.  Love Love Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20 plus years.</li>
    <li> For years as a young woman I switched shampoos every few months, never knowing why.  In 1983 the stylist who cut my hair used Traité, and I haven&#x27;t used another brand since.  Recently the beauty supply where I&#x27;ve been buying it closed, so I&#x27;m relieved to find it online.  I&#x27;m growing gray with Traité, and happily.</li>
    <li> Good Product and Quick Service</li>
    <li> Best shampoo on the planet.  So gentle, not greasy or heavy.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years. Recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
    <li> best sodium laureth-free shampoo on the planet...I  learned about Mastey products from a hair color specialist in Troy, Michigan and started using it after chemo treatments destroyed the texture of my hair. You can even use this for hand washing of delicate clothing. It comes with a pump type dispenser which is handy in the shower.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo but product was old.</li>
    <li> extra lather from second wash may be used on body instead of soap. mild and effective.and pleasant smelling. Also good value</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is fantastic shampoo.  My mediocre rating is due to the condition of the shampoo when it arrived.  When I tried pumping the product out of the bottle, it was clogged.  After taking it apart and removing the dried product that was clogging up the tube, I noted that the shampoo inside the bottle was dried out, like half-dried spackling.  This bottle must have been in storage for ages.  I added water and stirred the contents, but it is just not a creamy consistency and still won&#x27;t pump.  Think of dried toothpaste.  That is what it is like.  If I had not had the product for six months before trying, I would have returned it in a heartbeat.  Beware of the company selling this otherwise great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the MASTEY hair conditioner with my order, and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my hair look.  Then there&#x27;s the added bonus of it being cruelty free.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I thought I had dandruff but the stylist convinced me to try this. Turns out it was lack of moisture and shampoos that left a lot of residuals in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Have not had a problem since I started using this 10 years ago. Hard to find but the best stuff around.</li>
