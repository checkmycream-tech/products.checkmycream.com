<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The reminton ep1000 is the best epilator I have ever used. I was so disappointed&lt;br /&gt;when I just saw that is may not ever be in stock again. The one that I had to buy last time because this one was out of stock, I do not like at all. It does not remove the hair very well and it comes back quicker, than when I used the previous&lt;br /&gt;one. Sandy</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple months ago to replace the ancient Epilady I had which died a couple years ago. I just hate shaving and was fed up. I originally went with the Remington because of the lower price and the good reviews, but mostly because it had a 30 day guarantee. I was skeptical because I&#x27;d never used one of the tweezer style epilators- I only had used the old coil style and that worked great for me. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I got this one to use on my legs, and it does a pretty decent job. Although I will say at first it wasn&#x27;t  perfect. It does take time to get all the hairs, so you won&#x27;t have perfectly smooth legs on the first go. But it will get better after a few uses.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, the thing I&#x27;m most impressed with is how well this works on the bikini area. That is one hard area to shave and so, when I saw that this could be used there, I thought &#x27;what the heck!&#x27;  So I did and I have to say that this does  a remarkable job of getting that area smoother than any razor can! It does take a little practice and you have to be careful to avoid getting too close to overly sensitive areas, but it does get the job done remarkably well (just be sure to pull the skin tight). After a few minutes with my Smooth &amp; Silky, I only need to follow up with a tweezer to get those last few hairs in hard to reach spots and I&#x27;m good to go and stay smooth for a couple of weeks!  Hubby is impressed.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And it is SO much cheaper than going in for a wax... and I would imagine less painful too, not to mention that I don&#x27;t have to deal with contorting my naked self into all sorts of impossible positions for a stranger.  But then, I&#x27;m one of those people who never thought the old Epilady was painful either. I guess I just have a high tolerance or something, because this isn&#x27;t any more painful than, say, plucking your brows. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it! Smooth &amp; Silky is a good name for it :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this item strictly to use on my upper lip and chin. I normally wax, and even still got a little top layer of skin yanked off. (which turned into a nasty little scab as it healed)I also still had to go back over with tweezers for those strays. I threw out my wax as soon as I used this! It&#x27;s soo fast and easy. The pain is minimal(when you first start)to nothing(after you&#x27;ve started). Especially if you&#x27;re used to waxing. And there were NO strays, even the shortest hairs were gone. I personally had no irritation. This thing does a better job by far than any wax, even at a salon. I&#x27;m so excited that I&#x27;m trying to work up the nerve to do my legs and \\&quot;other areas\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve never waxed anywhere else though,that&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m a little hesitant.  I&#x27;ve never tried an epilator before and I&#x27;m sooo glad I got this! Although I&#x27;m a little mad at myself for not getting one sooner!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to replace waxing, and if not, something to take with me on trips that would not defeat many years of waxing. Based on the reviews, I thought this was the product. I was wrong.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A few reasons this product, in my opinion, is no good. &lt;br /&gt;First - the head is too big to get into the curves (like under your arms) &lt;br /&gt;Second - it takes a while to use, and it still doesn&#x27;t get ALL the hair. &lt;br /&gt;Third - you can&#x27;t get close enough to certain areas (like in the curves) because it will pinch your skin (and it does hurt, and leaves a nice red pinch mark) &lt;br /&gt;Finally - if you are using it on an area you have always shaved, it is sooooo very painful to start using that you may never make it passed the first time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, I will say that it works OK on the bikini area with very little discomfort. It takes a little longer than I prefer because you really have to go over it several times, but eventually it will get MOST of it - not all depending on how your body curves.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried it under my arms and it doesn&#x27;t get close enough inside the curve to actually get the hair out, if it were closer (as I have found out) it pinches your skin - and that is worse than waxing burns. If you are not close enough it will literally YANK the hair (pulling at the skin) which will cause some discomfort. Sometimes it just breaks the hair and doesn&#x27;t actually pull it out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my legs and I couldn&#x27;t handle the pain to complete the job (but I have always shaved them). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you want something for a small area, or an  area you have been waxing a while, this might be OK. If you are not a waxer, be careful - it may be more painful that you expect.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I was dubious to say the least. Ripping my hair out from the root? Doesn&#x27;t sound like fun does it? Well girls (and perhaps some boys) I will tell you, I love this thing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I knew it was going to be unpleasant, so I was prepared. It did sting, yes. But, once you get passed the initial \\&quot;holy crap that bites\\&quot; part, the area around where you have just felt pain numbs itself. By the time you finish one area about 3 inches in diameter, you&#x27;ll have the hang of it and the bite will seem far less painful. By the time you finish one leg, you&#x27;ll most likely feel like an old pro. It may leave some lingering, very short hairs, but you can barely tell and it&#x27;s almost fun to try and chase them down in the second round a couple days later.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m quite ready to do my underarms, but they are next on my list and I have little doubt that it will be just as useful as it was on my legs.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A little pain and I don&#x27;t have to shave for weeks. Is it worth it? Heck yes it&#x27;s worth it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love this thing.</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator, and I am very pleased with it.   I have dark hair, so shaving only keeps my legs looking nice for about a day, and I find waxing and sugaring messy and expensive. &lt;br /&gt;This gadget is very effective and easy to use on the legs.   On the armpits, it can be a bit more awkward since the skin there is not as firm, but it is do-able with a little patience. &lt;br /&gt;As for the pain, it is different from waxing/sugaring since it is a much slower process, but I don&#x27;t find it bad at all.  I would say it is more like pins and needles than the smarting feeling you get from waxing. &lt;br /&gt;One suggestion I would have is to use this before bed-time, or at least well before you plan on showing off your legs.   I experienced some red dots around the follicles where the hair came out for several hours after my first use, but they went away and did not leave any marks.</li>
    <li> I have always resented the dark root and the 5pm shadow on my legs and underneath my arm. The product is the perfect solution! As promised in the user&#x27;s manual, after using it weekly for 4 weeks, the hair doesn&#x27;t grow back that fast any more. I can enjoy perfectly smooth skin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The first time was a bit painful, especially underneath my arm. But no pain no gain. After you got through the first trial, the following sessions (only once a week in the beginning) are perfecly endurable (for a woman). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone who doesn&#x27;t like shaving and who resent dark root and 5pm shadow as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product and its ability to remove hair. I read through several of the other reviews before purchasing, and I am not surprised that some people found it painful - it is, if you&#x27;ve never used an epilator before. But as far as I can tell, all epilators are uncomfortable in the beginning. I had been using a European one for 3 years before getting this one because I needed one that ran on US voltage. The results are great - better than what I get with my European one that cost 3 times more. However, this one is a little scary because the \\&quot;blades\\&quot; rotate very, very fast and make a lot of noise. I wasn&#x27;t so sure about putting it up to my skin at first, but once you take the plunge it&#x27;s fine. I would say that one disadvantage is that it only has 1 speed, whereas others have 2 speeds. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The one big drawback is that it does have the tendency to catch skin. I was pinched twice while using it in the bikini area. I think you have to be careful over any area with loose skin - make sure to pull the skin taut and watch where you are going. It is freaky when it catches the skin but the motor stops automatically so it doesn&#x27;t really hurt, just pinches a little. Still, I would be careful.</li>
    <li> After reading the many positive reviews of this epilator, I was expecting a lot.  And you know what?  It actually lived up to its hype.  I&#x27;m a \\&quot;newbie\\&quot; at epilating, but I found that the EP1000 was extremely easy to use.  I didn&#x27;t experience much pain at all (on my legs)--in fact, I acclimated to the feeling within ten seconds of turning it on.  I had to make several swipes over my legs to catch stray hairs that I originally missed, but it was hardly a bother.  It didn&#x27;t take very long to do my legs, either; probably half an hour MAX.  I also used it on my underarms and bikini area...I found the underarm area to be the most painful, but it&#x27;s worth the smooth skin afterwards.  I want to caution you, though...do NOT go back over the area over and over again in the same sitting if your skin starts to feel sensitive.  You WILL end up hurting yourself.  Applying a cooling gel afterwards with aloe should help clear up any irritation or red bumps that might have appeared.  I did have bumps appear temporarily on my legs, but they disappeared within an hour or so of epilating.  If you can pull your skin tight, you&#x27;re less likely to have pain and easier epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid getting ingrown hairs, make sure you exfoliate the epilated areas with a scrub or a loofah occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely make this purchase again.  It was WELL worth the price and is extremely easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I am very satisfied. It is a little painful so I just do a little at a time. It took me two days to do my legs. I can not do my underarms, it hurts to much so I&#x27;m using a hair removal cream for a while in hopes of weakening the roots. I&#x27;m most excited about my bikini! I want to go Brazilian, but can&#x27;t afford a salon. This is why I got it, even though I wasn&#x27;t sure, because every thing I found said it was only for the bikini line. I&#x27;m here to say that it can be done! Already done about 3/4 of the entire bikini area. My husband is out of the country, so I&#x27;m taking my time. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering a razor, tried it when it came, hurt a little bit the first time I used it, but it really does work.  It also gets more comfortable after using it once a week.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the price but I&#x27;m realizing that it leaves a lot of bumps no matter how you use it. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin smooth like waxing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to replace waxing but I&#x27;d recommend it for touch ups or stray hairs.</li>
    <li> I have a very low pain threshold, and for years, I resisted getting an epilator.  I finally put my fears aside and purchased this product, and I am glad that I did.  I would not recommend using this on underarms or in the pubic area, but legs and arms are a breeze with this.  The pain is minimal (trust me, that&#x27;s a big deal for me!) and knowing that I will never again sport shaving nicks on my legs is a huge relief.  Also, I can use this epilator, and exfoliate my legs afterwards (try doing that after shaving - ouch!).</li>
    <li> This is a very good machine. It is very quick, easy to clean, easy to handle and works perfectly even with the shortest and finest hair. It has a compact design, and a practic bag to carry on if you&#x27;re traveling.  &lt;br /&gt;The prize is good also. The only detail that I don&#x27;t like is that it has just one velocity. &lt;br /&gt;If you have no problem with this, I think that it is an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> This product is so worth the money I paid for it! I used it on my legs once a week for two weeks. After that I didn&#x27;t need to use it again for a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roommate tried it and she found it very uncomfortable, but I feel very little or no pain at all when using it on my legs. The bikini area is a different story, though. I worked on that area every day for about a week just because my skin would get so red and puffy. I think it was worth it, though. No razor burn and the mild swelling went down after about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this priduct, DO! I love it!</li>
    <li> wow, the first and only time i used this on my legs, i was surprised by how much it hurt! i would rather have a brazilian wax job!! i attempted the under arm and i must emphasize ATTEMPTED!</li>
    <li> From the reviews I&#x27;ve seen, it was rated as the best. I&#x27;m on the fence.  I had to let it go for a day or so for the hair to grow long enough for the parts to grasp the hairs but it seemed more to break the hair off than pull it from the root.  It did remove hair.  I may have to let it grow out longer for it to work properly but I seem to do that.  It doesn&#x27;t get the short hairs at all.  I&#x27;ve gone over the same spot multiple times and it gets a little more but it also scrapes the skin a little-no blood, just dry patches.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister. I started epilating my legs when I turned 40. Now she&#x27;s doing it too.  We will never go back to shaving. My daughter is 10 and talks about shaving; I say, No, but when you can handle the initial pain of epilating, you can use my epilator and then will never have hard razor stubble, just soft, smooth baby fine hair when you let it grow in, or smooth legs when you don&#x27;t let it grow in.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but the instructions were not very detailed.  When you use it on your calves/thighs you have to hold it with the labeled side facing away from you.  At first I used it the other way and it wasn&#x27;t working very well.  I got red bumps from going over the same area too often.  When I did it the correct way I was able to remove the hair.  At first it is painful but you get used to it.  I got this as the best alternative to shaving.  I tried the gel hair remover recently and found it frustrating and messy.  This is much better.</li>
    <li> This gold plated monster hurts more than getting a tattoo done.  Marquis deSade would have loved one of these.  I wish I had not wasted my money on this hair removal system.  It works, don&#x27;t get me wrong.  It does really well on your legs, mediocore on the face and I couldn&#x27;t make myself try it out on my underarms.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to my razor and shaving cream.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun Epilator that I had for years that served my purpose for eliminating unwanted facial hair.  Unfortunately, I dropped it and it broke where I had to invest in another one.  I was pleased to find the review of February, 2003 to let me know that someone else tried this epilator for unwanted facial hair as well and was very pleased with it so I decided to try it.  This product is GREAT.  Have used it and not had to use again for months at a time and am very confident of the hypoallergenic blades which is a real plus.  Would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first hair removal equipment and I&#x27;m happy with its results. It works great for underarms. The first time usage was painful and resulted in red clots all over but it vanished in half hour. Now, after using for 3-4times hair growth is visibly reduced.</li>
    <li> Effective at removing even heavier hair, but not the greatest construction. I suspected this item was made in China before ordering, and that turned out to be correct.  My better judgement would have had me return it in the first 30 days for a full refund, but I didn&#x27;t, and, unfortunately, a plastic bearing race broke after not that much use (it still epilates, amazingly).  I&#x27;d recommend the Braun EverSoft over this, esp. as it&#x27;s only $2 more currently here at Amazon, and Braun epilators are made in France and last much longer.</li>
    <li> Being a big fan of hair removal, I was looking for a newer product that picked up hair better than my 15 year old Epilady and the Remington EP1000 for $24.99 did not disappoint. It was fast, gave pretty clean results with no mess to clean up. I used it on my legs first, then underarms, upper lip and bikini area (ouch). My friend borrowed it for use on her forearms. She loved the ease and quick results. It sure beats waxing for speed, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it on my bikini area again since it&#x27;s hard to get precise results.</li>
    <li> I came on looking to buy an electric razor when I ran across the Remington EP-1000. My first thought was no way! I had the Epilady back in the 80&#x27;s and tried using it.. ooohhhh the pain!!! There was no mercy for my poor legs. After reading the reviews from customers using the EP-1000 and how it was more skin friendly I thought what the heck, give it a try. I have waxed in the past and it wasn&#x27;t all that bad. I was excited to try the EP-1000 when it arrived last wensday, I must say other than the slight pain on my knees (that went away quickly) it was a dream to use, my legs are so smooth that I can actually sleep with myself again. hahaha I used it to get rid of those pesky chin hairs (much quicker then plucking and didn&#x27;t hurt like when I would try to get the the hair but pinch the skin instead) I haven&#x27;t had the chance yet to try it on my bikini area nor my under arms but that is coming soon. As for getting red spots as a few women explained getting, there were none at all on my legs. Could be because I keep my skin hydrated cause I haven&#x27;t waxed in about a year. I am so happy to say byebye to razors and razor rash and hello to smooth skin! I highly recommend this to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of epilators; I think it is the best, easiest, and fastest way of fur control ;-). I am an epilator user for almost 15 years now, and in the past, I always have choused the cheapest model, usually ending up with a non brand name item that does the work good enough. This time the price was not my only concern, and I love the good balance of price and quality this model presents! Remington EP1000 does the work fast and good. It doesn&#x27;t do much for the \\&quot;pain\\&quot;, I know some other brands are claming that their new models lower the pain factor. I am skeptic; I don&#x27;t think it hurts that much, and I don&#x27;t believe something can be done for that, so I am really happy with my new Remington EP1000.</li>
    <li> I have this and have used it off and on for a couple of years, but I stopped recently because I get a lot of ingrown hairs with this product, or hairs that grow just under the surface of the skin. My hair grows very quickly also and I think that contributes to the problem. Most women&#x27;s hair doesn&#x27;t grow as quickly as mine, so I think it may be a good product for them. I have very sensitive skin also, I find that a skin buffing system works best for me on my legs, I use a razor elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I am giving this 3 stars because I am so impressed with the customer service I received from Remington as well as the fact that this product does work. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s really painful to use. I suppose I fall under the not so kind definition of \\&quot;wussy\\&quot; that one reviewer used to describe people such as myself who have never gone through waxing and therefore are unable to appreciate the fact that having your hairs ripped out a few at a time is so much better than having them ripped out all at once. I would think that someone with sparsely populated legs would be better able to use this. I, for one, have many thousands of hairs on my legs and each hair being pulled out feels like a bee sting. The directions also say to use this epilator weekly, even though it is promoted as results lasting 4 to 6 weeks. I also think that someone who wants to remove a few facial hairs could stand using this product. I just can&#x27;t force myself to rip out thousands of leg hairs and am, unfortunately, going back to shaving.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!!  use with care and clean up is so easy you won&#x27;t mind doing it EVERY time u use it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;the more u use it, the softer the hair gets, and easier to pull out. it&#x27;s AWESOME!!!</li>
    <li> I used the coil type epilator in the 80&#x27;s and couldn&#x27;t stand it. I have been using the new type epilators for about 10 years. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s better than shaving. It takes me about 1/2 hour to do legs and armpits and bikini, and if I do it weekly, there are only a few stray hairs I am removing each time. I get occasional ingrowns. It does hurt, but the pain is less with years of use, now my legs and armpits don&#x27;t hurt at all and the actual bikini line hurts a little. I do my own brazilians and that hurts but it&#x27;s worth it, the hairs do grow finer with time and the pain does lessen with time. I don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving every day or what outfit or swimsuit I can wear in the summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated plucking because its so painful and you can only do one at a time. W/ this thingy, it was more pain, but more gain. I liked it and I would recommend it, but its def. not painless.</li>
    <li> This is my first Epilator. I like it and its very easy to learn how to use it with a little bit of practice. Sometimes if you are not careful enough to stretch your skin a little while using it in areas where your skin might fold a little eg knee joint , under arms  etc., you might end up getting your skin caught in its gold plated discs. But if used carefully , its an excellent product which removes very small hair also. I am very satisfied with my overall experience with this Remington product.</li>
    <li> I have been thinking about Epilady items since they first came out, but everyone said NO NO NO too painful.  I tried waxing, Ouch and costly.  I have shaved for years, tired of that.  I read the reviews a few days ago and bought one, what did I have to lose for the price.  I LOVE IT.  It is so easy.  I can do it in front of the TV, my legs.  Yes, it takes a bit but the pain is so minimal that I am excited at the thought of getting those last few hairs I missed.  I&#x27;ve done my underarms too.  Yep, a bit ouchy but worth it.  I suggest using it a little each day after your last round of shaving.  That way you never have to do all the hairs at one time.  It did take me several days using this method but it was so pain free I raced in there to finish another round.  I have now removed my razor from the shower and my legs are smooth.  This is worth the wait.  Oh and yes the reviews are correct.  Pull your skin slightly to make it smooth before removing hair on that section.  It&#x27;s less painful and I&#x27;ve never caught any skin it it that way.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ts the fist time I use this product and it works excellent, I&#x60;m satisfied...</li>
    <li> I love this epilator.  I had a Braun Eversoft and replaced it with this one because it kept breaking the hair off at the surface.  This one actually pulls it out by the roots.  The hair does come in less coarse and not as thick.  The only gripe I would possibly have is that it&#x27;s kind of hard to get all the hairs out after using it.  This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she says it is the best product of its type she has used.  She has tried them all and thinks this is best.</li>
    <li> this is the first epilator that i have used, and it works sooooo good. when i got it, i didn&#x27;t read the manual n ended up with red bumps and cuts on my arm. but it didn&#x27;t hurt. it was just pressing the epilator too hard on my skin. BUT buy this product it works great....</li>
    <li> A good product worthy of the money.  You can definitely save money by using this product as opposed to paying to have it done</li>
    <li> I had one of those coil-type epilators back in the eighties, which was a torture device, to put it simply.  I gave up on it after a few months and went back to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a couple of decades, to when the Remington EP1000 shows up in my gold box.  I was a little nervous about ordering it, given my past experience, but was won over by the positive reviews.  Wow, am I glad I did!  This thing causes, oh, a little mild discomfort, but nothing worse than that.  It&#x27;s certainly less painful than waxing.  The design is such that it can&#x27;t grab more than two or three hairs at a time; you&#x27;re never going to be pulling out great tufts all at once, like my old inquisition-style coil did.&lt;br /&gt;Even better, you can use the EP1000 on your face.  Warning to the younger women out there:  After you pass 40, you&#x27;ll learn about chin hairs.  &#x27;Nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the EP1000 a couple of times a week for over a month now, and my legs are smooth and silky, my chin is, er, youthful, and I&#x27;m not cringing in pain!  Bravo to these second-generation epilators; I&#x27;ll never go back to the razor now.</li>
    <li> i have been looking for a good hair-removal system for years--tried waxing (too messy, ingrown hairs) dipilatories (messy, smells, burns) shaving (nicks, stubble)--everything!  but now i can stop experimenting.  this thing is perfect!!  less painful than waxing, not at all messy, portable (must be near an outlet, though), and gets all hairs, with no stubble!  also, you don&#x27;t have to wait long at all between sessions (unlike waxing, which requires about 1/8 inch of growth--very impractical!).  however, be warned--i recommend shaving a few days before the first time, as it is a pain to clean the long hairs out of the machine, not to mention off of the floor! &lt;br /&gt;all in all, i highly recommend this device.  i expect to use it for the rest of my life.  really.</li>
    <li> This hair removal system works just as well as the higher priced ones out there!!  Very happy with how it works!  Used it to do my legs today and of course there is the 2 minute sting going on till my skin becomes accustomed to it...the pain we go through to have smooth legs........LOL!!!  Recommend this Remington EP1000 very much! &lt;br /&gt;Thanks, &lt;br /&gt;H. Palmer &lt;br /&gt;Minnesota</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much. My dream of having silky and smooth skin came true after using this product... I am so impressed that I suggested this product to all my friends too.. One statement for this product is \\&quot;This is something amazing.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> For some reason it&#x27;s not painfull. Really like the result and now I&#x27;m waiting for ingorw hair :)</li>
    <li> My wife has very sensitive skin so we tried allmost evry option she can find to remove hairs but they all were giving her rashes. Finally i found Conair HB1R Ultimate Hair Remover I bough it from TARGET for 30+ bucks and when i tried it I realised that conAir just forget to test it b4 lanching it in the market because it not not remove hair at all :) (may be they created it for something else). I got this from amazon for 25$ after i returned HB1R.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best thing about this product is the developed a simple concept to remove hair. this machine just grips your hair in its teeth and pull them out. no need to practice my wife started using it as it came out of box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looking at the mechanism it has it lloks like this is not a appropriate for ppl with very thin hair because the will breake before this machine can pull them out. but otherwise it is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;while using it it pais a little bit but as they say NO PAIN NO GAIN :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I used it some time to remove unwanted hair around my eyes and it works good with me too :)</li>
    <li> after 70 some reviews, i thought this epilator was a sure winner, but i&#x27;d rather shave every day than endure the pain that this thing inflicts every single time it plucks one of the hairs out, and the time that is spent on one leg (up to my knee, i couldn&#x27;t bring myself up to try the thigh) is 30min. I am returning it ASAP. If anyone wants not to be bothered with returns hastle, do yourself a favor and skip on this epilator.</li>
    <li> I had wanted to try one of these for a while and finally purchased this one because of all of the positive reviews.  I used it as soon as it arrived and WOW!  Considerably less painful than waxing and while it isn&#x27;t as quick, you can go back and catch hair you missed right away.  I am sold.  This is a great product and I love it.</li>
    <li> The remington EP1000 is the best - better than my last hair removal system Braun - which yanked my skin.  A very effective and easy way to remove unwanted hair - once you get used to hair being pulled out by its root - its gets less painful - even works on very short hair.</li>
    <li> I had never used an epilator before and had always heard that they were painful to use.  This showed up in my gold box and I took the plunge.  To my surprise, it is only mildly uncomfortable and not painful at all.  I bought it to use on those pesky chin hairs (yes, all of you over 40, they do happen!)and it worked beautifully, even under my chin. It is so much easier and faster than plucking, and is not any more uncomfortable, and that was on tender skin on my face and neck! Can&#x27;t wait to use it on my legs!  It left a mild redness, but did not nick or create a rash. I only used some moisturing creme after and that was it, no pre-preparation creams or powders (I think that these products would clog up the epilators and could make things slippery). My first eiplation lasted probably 5 minutes! Just make sure to keep the skin dry and taut, and keep it at a 90 degree angle with no pressure. Just move it gently in a circular motion and it will take those nasty little hairs away! Great product, great price, and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Finally i found it!!! &lt;br /&gt;I struggled over 10 years with razors, waxing, cream, etc. &lt;br /&gt;Now i don&#x27;t have to deal with those things anymore. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have very itchy skin after using it, which can last for a very long time like 2 weeks. And I can see the reason--the skin is irritated and breaking out of the new hair can lead to the itchiness. Does anyone else here have the problem?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I used it couple of times on my legs. Resulted in too many in-growns.  I never had in grown hair on my legs before ..Until I Used this.     My legs looked UGLY and I had to go back to traditional waxing and it took me almost a year to make my legs look better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for over 5 years and it still works great. The hair on my legs is at least 50% sparser and takes much longer to grow back. And my underarm hair is practically non existent after so many years of epilating. You get so used to the feeling that, to me, it doesn&#x27;t even hurt anymore. Sounds funny but it&#x27;s satisfying to feel the slight pinching and then see all the hair disappear. The best thing is that you can do it as often as you like. It pulls out even the shortest and finest of hairs if you do it right. You don&#x27;t have to hide in a cave and wait for your hair to grow long enough to wax. It has saved me so much money on waxing, disposable razors, etc. Anyone considering pricey laser hair removal should try this first.     This product is simply amazing. I could never go back to shaving or waxing ever again, and don&#x27;t plan to!</li>
    <li> I get tweezer happy most of the time.  I pluck the upper lip area, eyebrows, underarms, and when I&#x27;m very bored my legs.. the only thing I refuse to pluck is the bikini area (not that brave).  With all the plucking I do, it gets tiresome and very time consuming... there has to be another alternative... REMINGTON EP1000 SMOOTH &amp; SILKY was the answer.  I had my doubts after reading so many reviews from different sites but this actually works! It works on my legs and my upper lip area, but the underarm was hard to achieve so thats why i gave it 4 stars.  It took most of the hairs out but I felt some stinging sensation afterwards and there were still a few haris left that it just would not pull out.  I just have to find another technique, thats all.&lt;br /&gt;It is scary when you turn it on but after a few tries it starts to tickle.  I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t hurt but I&#x27;m used to pain from all the plucking I did before.  If you never plucked a single hair from your body, I suggest tweeze first so you get used to the pain, because this gadet takes a few hairs out at once.  &lt;br /&gt;I like that it uses a cord rather than battery operated because  it takes a while to get all the hairs and your battery may run out.  It also has a safety feature that it slow down when pressed to hard on the skin.  &lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this product.  It is worth the money and the Amazon free ship offer made it better..  I got it in 4 days!  I highly recommend this.  If you read any negative reviews it is only because those women aren&#x27;t strong enough to stand the initial pain.  The pain will lessen after a few tries. It just takes getting used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure a few guys will be looking at this product in the search for a smoother body.  As a 20 year old male, I wanted a smooth chest and was beginning to loose that battle, so I ordered this product in hopes it could get me smooth quickly and keep me smooth for at least a week or so between maintainence.  So I am the ultimate test subject - if this thing can rip hair out of an adult male, it can certainly handle almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;To both guys and gals... this thing may cause unbearable pain at first, but stick with it.  The pain only lasts a fraction of a second - afterwards, I experienced only minor irritation (less that that of Nair) with a lot of redness, quickly fading over a few days.  I started smack dab in the middle of my chest and it took my a good half hour just to build the nerve to clear out a 3x1 inch spot on my chest.  I suggest you make a \\&quot;home base\\&quot; spot that is clear of hair and work off that - it also helps to trim the hair short so 1/2&#x27;&#x27; stubs are sticking straight up (prevents that \\&quot;snagging\\&quot; feeling).  Over the period of a few days, I would get it out from time to time, and here&#x27;s what I learned.&lt;br /&gt;1. Doing it just after the shower may help with \\&quot;tough-skinned\\&quot; areas, such as the upper chest for guys or legs for the gals, however the sensative areas are even more sensative just after a warm shower, and I&#x27;ve found it much less painful to do it in the morning or early afternoon (before you get all sweaty and greasy from the day).&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t think you have to hold the thing flat against your body -- it is almost impossible to keep a steady hand when you&#x27;re ripping out 20+ hairs in a few seconds.  So I tilt it on the side so only one of the three puller-outers are pulling hair - this makes it much more tolerable and I find that it goes faster this way.&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep number 2 in mind, but don&#x27;t go too easy on yourself either.  It&#x27;s actually less painful in the long run to keep a steady pace with it.  While it will sting at first, if you keep steady, your mind quickly adapts to the sensation and it becomes much more tolerable.  You just have to get your mind to realize your body is not in harm, despite all the sensations that are being sent to it.  So, give it time - the first time around is a killer because the roots are in deep and they&#x27;re stubborn, but they say it gets better the second and third times.  You have 30 days to check it out risk free, so utilize those as long as you can.  :)  Happy hair pulling!&lt;br /&gt;** Update ** I have finally finished my whole chest (took about a week @ 1 hour per day, most of it came out the last 3 days when I learned how to use it best).  I did it in zones: mid-chest, navel, sides, and upper chest.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  So, here&#x27;s the deal for us guys.  You must be absolutely determined to do this.  I was hung-go to do this and almost had the thing in a box to ship it back.  Ladies, I don&#x27;t think this will be as much of a problem for you - the pain on legs should be very tolerable.  If you&#x27;re determined, try it out - you&#x27;ve got 30 days risk-free, so use them all!  It&#x27;s really not too bad once you get used to it - I&#x27;m planning on tackling some spots on my back without cringing too much.  Maintainece shouldn&#x27;t be too bad once you get the first batch gone, just keep up with it.  It broke some of my chest hairs off without pulling out the root, so they&#x27;ve been growing in and I&#x27;ve been running it over those areas real quick every day and it&#x27;s a breeze.  This&#x27;ll mess your chest up for about a week, so give it time to \\&quot;heal\\&quot; and let the redness go away - don&#x27;t plan on any dates on the day you do this.</li>
    <li> This product is quite a disappointment because it does not do what I expected of it.  I bought it because other reviewers raved about it.  I use it mainly for my facial hair, since I don&#x27;t have much on my arms and legs.  I used to shave or wax.  My facial hair would start growing back in a week with shaving or waxing.  I was hoping that this product would do better, but it does not.  My hair is soft and fine, so maybe that&#x27;s why it does not work for me.  When I use this product, I can see my hair breaks in the middle and does not get uprooted completely.  The pain is nothing if you can withstand waxing.  I am still using it only because it is more convenient and cheaper than running to a salon for waxing and psychologically suits me better than shaving.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the epliator to be really painful when I first got it.  But I was pleasantly suprised to find out that it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  It hurt more on my legs but the hair is also finer since I don&#x27;t need to shave my legs.  I used for my underarms and it worked pretty well once I got the angles right.  The only thing about it is that it broke off some of the finer hairs.  And it makes a fairly loud and slightly scary noise.  I think it&#x27;s best for coarse hairs.</li>
    <li> I debated between this and the Emjoi Optimax. I wanted something that would do facial hair and legs.  I bought this one because it had better reviews and was half the price. I am here to tell you it works as promised, but it hurts. It does get more tolerable after awhile, but it still hurts. If 3.5 stars were available I would give it that, because it does get most hair in a couple passes, but I cannot give it 4 stars because it hurts too much for me to use it regularly. If I find I get used to it, I&#x27;ll upgrade my rating.</li>
    <li> My upper lip turned out to be too sensitive for this and it left me nasty ingrown hair and bumps on my legs and bikini area. So now I only use this for my underarms.      This is a great product for the underarms. Regular shaving had left me alligator skin for armpits. Using this and the new Dove deodorant I had finally returned to baby soft underarms. Everything was going well until one day I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and it snagged my skin really badly. And boy was that painful. Much later (after healing completely) I had an epiphany and decided to put a thin layer of fine talcum powder on my pits before using it and witnessed great results. The epilator just slided a lot smoother and seemed to pick up more hair than without the talc.     I am not sure how good this is for the life of the epilator but I have been doing this for 7 months and it hasn&#x27;t died on me yet.     Update: 2 years later, still going strong.</li>
    <li> Waxing always hurt a lot where I&#x27;m concerned, so I was expecting this thing to hurt quite a bit, too, but it didn&#x27;t. The absolute worst (in very sensitive spots) was about akin to pulling off a bandade. It&#x27;s not loud at all either. It takes a while to use if you have a lot of hair to remove, though :).</li>
    <li> For some background, I&#x27;ve shaved my legs and armpits for the past 15+ years.  My only other experience with an epilator was in the 80s, when I tried Epilady on my legs and found it very painful but not so painful I wouldn&#x27;t use it again (alas, it was my mother&#x27;s and she was determined to return it to the store).  When I shave, my legs are covered with a coarse, dark stubble by the next day.  I&#x27;ve tried home waxing using various products, but not only is it messy but it&#x27;s extremely painful and requires several applications over the same areas of skin.  Depilating cremes work only splotchily, and my best success with them came with shaving first and using the creme to retard regrowth, perhaps buying me a few smooth days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Remington EP1000 after staring at the new waxing products in the drug store and finding an epilator mixed in with the waxes.  Never one to buy the first thing I see, I went home and researched epilators on Amazon.com, finally deciding to go with the Remington EP1000.  At the time of this review, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was switching from shaving to epilating, I planned to epilate daily at first.  It was a joy to be able to simply plug in the unit and work from the comfort of my bed, needing no special preparation unlike waxing or shaving or using a creme.  If I had to stop midway through, no problems!  Following advice I&#x27;d read in these forums, I made of point of epilating either late at night or early in the morning, before showering, so that my hairs were at their toughest.  And for the first week, I spent from 45 minutes the first time to 15 minutes by the end of the week epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must move the epilator repeatedly over the same patches of skin, often in varying directions, to remove all the hairs.  You must make a point of exfoliating the skin when you bathe, to combat the problem of ingrown hairs.  Extra time and care is needed, overall, to use an epilator successfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An epilator is much more painful than shaving or using a creme.  It&#x27;s less painful than waxing, although what pain there is is spread out over a longer period of time.  The Remington EP1000 is definitely less painful than an Epilady from the 80s, but I couldn&#x27;t tell you how painful it is compared to other epilators currently on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, using the epilator is time-consuming and painful.  What are the benefits?  After day 1 of using the epilator (and it took me a full week to get my legs completely smooth), my legs felt much smoother to the touch.  Grabbing my ankles the next day in Pilates class was actually a joy, because I wasn&#x27;t grabbing a bunch of stubble.  I still had stray hairs here and there that needed to go (and more hairs growing in constantly because originally they were only shaved), but the positive effects of epilation was immediate.  After my first week of epilating daily, I stopped epilating, and it&#x27;s only a week later that I feel like I really need to start up again.  My hairs are still growing in coase and dark, but I&#x27;ve been told that after a few months of this, the hairs will grow in soft and lighter and the pain of epilating will lessen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re hoping for a pain-free, grab and go, quick-fix, epilating probably isn&#x27;t for you.  If you&#x27;re looking for a compromise between waxing and shaving, your skin isn&#x27;t highly sensitive (marks disappear for me within a few hours), and you have a decent pain tolerance, choose an epilator, and I highly recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And if you have a few drinks in you, go ahead and epilate your underarms.  It&#x27;s painful, but not too terribly so.)ssfully.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;An epilator is much more painful than shaving or using a creme.

    <li> This product is definitely worth the money.  It provides a great alternative to shaving, using creams or waxing.  I spent some time on Amazon looking for it before I bought it, and I am glad I did.  Some cousins and aunts have turned to it because they saw me using it at recent family gathering.  It has been working pretty smoothly, and it doesnt seem to be cheaply made.  A warning though, do not use it for your face!  Especially if you have done your legs on it a few times.  You know what I mean!</li>
    <li> I really like this porduct. It doesnt take long time as it takes for waxing and also takes long time for the hair to come back. But onething I observed is , if you do not do it regularly , like you got very busy and did not do it,u can see that two hair strands coming from one root and makes it a real big volume than before. But if you do this regulary its a good product to use..... &lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is ok, but takes a lot longer than other similar products to do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews.  Yes, it does hurt some, but no, it&#x27;s not unbearable.  What you have to remember is that it&#x27;s pulling your hairs out, not just cutting them off at the surface.  So if you feel pain strongly, don&#x27;t bother with it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.  I have slow-growing, fine hair, so I only need to use it every 3-4 weeks.  I have to let the hair grow to about 1/2\\&quot; long before it works well on me, but that&#x27;s because the hair is so fine that it needs the length to be able to catch hold of them.  I definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> As one who could definitely use to shave every day, but naturally wishes for an easier solution, I was excited finally to purchase an epilator.  When it arrived, I immediately plugged it in and went away at my lower calves.  The excitement died down quickly as the pain of needles digging through my flesh overcame me.  I managed a tiny area on my calf, a bit on my knee, and a spot on my bikini line.  Interestingly enough, the bikini line hurt the least.  Anyway, my trusty razor was back out the next morning, and this little gizmo is back in the box.  I didn&#x27;t think I had a low tolerance for pain, but perhaps you will have better luck with it!</li>
    <li> I had bought this Item and was verry happy at first. Yes there was some pain but to be expected.. Come on it pulls the hairs out by the root. How ever the thing that maid me upset is it lasted about 6 months total and the gears went out in it. I sent it back and they sent me a new one I only had to pay the shipping but the next one lasted about the same lenght of time.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this hair removal machine, I used it on my left leg thinking that would be the least sensitive spot.  I was mortified to find that it was shockingly painful and to tell the truth...the sight and sound of the spinning discs were really scary!!!  But after biting down and bearing the pain I loved the results.  And after three weeks of use, I love it even more.  The results last a lot longer than shaving and it&#x27;s definitely less messy and time consuming than wax.  It&#x27;s kind of like my boyfriend&#x27;s Norelco shaver because you can do it while watching tv or listening to music so you&#x27;re not confined to the bathroom anymore.  But unlike the electric razor, you have to realize that this epil machine is yanking your hairs out at warp speed.  It&#x27;ll hurt!  But as far as perfomance is concerned, I definitely recommend this product because the it does it&#x27;s job. And for those of you who are still wondering about the pain... It does get less painful as you continue do use it though I doubt it will ever be pain-free.  So if you are uneasy about waxing or even plucking.  Stick with your Venus :)</li>
    <li> This thing is far to painful to be bothered with.  I tried this on myself for at least 15 minutes, before attempting to use it on my wife and found it to be slow torture.  At one point, it snagged too much hair and came to an immediate and painful halt (thankfully).  I understand that some people like pain, but my wife and I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  Like a lawnmower on grass.  If you like having your hairs painfully yanked out at super speed, then by all means buy this product.</li>
    <li> This Epilator has been the best pruchase. I have waxed all my life and thought that was the best way, but trying the remington epilator, i have realized that it is much better: no mess like with wax, hurts less, and the hair grows back lighter. It really works!</li>
    <li> This is a great prouct.  I purchased five different makes and models of the hair removal systems and I was quite pleased with these three,</li>
    <li> Works well - though can catch the skin when working underarms or back of knee if you don&#x27;t pull the skin tight.</li>
    <li> This product is good. The hair doesnt grow back for at least a week or so, but there is a problem of ingrown hair. Also, if you cant handle pain, this one is not for you. It DEFINITELY stings!!!</li>
    <li> Works OK- does tingle for those of you that are ultra sensitive. It does not pull every hair from the root some do break off and you have to wait for more hair growth. I do it about every 3-4 days to get the new growth. Also do at night it will leave noticable red bumps.  I tried to get this from amozon but it was sold out- so I went to the local store and it was only 39.95 no s&amp;amp;h.</li>
    <li> It took about 12 minutes for me to get used to the initial shock of using this machine, but it DOES work.  My recommendation is to let your hair grow out for a full week before using, otherwise you&#x27;ll need to use it every day until all of the hairs catch up to each other.&lt;br /&gt;Defintely worth the money for us few women who have been blessed with having to shave our legs EVERY DAY.  Using this product is a welcomed change.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before my purchase.  Once my product arrived I tried it immediately.  I am amazed and astouded.  It works well, it works quickly, and efficiently.  I am happy with the result and I am more than happy with the fine hair that it removes.  I have problem areas on my face with baby fine hair on my chin.  I can&#x27;t seem to get it with wax but this product removed it with ease.  The amount of pain is really very tolerable when you consider it is pulling the hair out.  I love this product.  Even if I only use it this one time (I can assure you I will reuse it), it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Thanks to everyone else for their detailed and helpful reviews that convinced me to buy this! Wasn&#x27;t even looking for it - it showed up in my Gold Box and I was curious. Used it on my legs 3 days ago - yes it hurt some, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. Electrolysis is much more painful to me. About the same pain or even less than waxing. After 3 days, my legs are about the same as they were when I first did it - and I have stubbly, coarse, fast growing hair. I have a feeling over time of using the product that it&#x27;s going to be even a lot better. I got up the courage to do my underarms last night after letting them grow out for 3 days. It hurt but I kept breathing and it was over relatively quickly. Could tell I got all the hairs when I went over and over the area and there was no pain. Interestingly enough there was no irritation afterwards - and there always was with shaving. No irritation with deodorant after my morning shower either.. ALSO, thanks to everyone for the tips for using it - pointing the front away from my body was useful and that wasn&#x27;t in the directions. I also found that as long as I kept it at 90 degrees, it was sometimes helpful to turn it in different directions on stubborn hairs that may be growing at a certain angle on say the back of my leg or the shin bone. One last hurrah - it works on my knees much better than a razor ever did! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product after my daughter&#x27;s friend said it was the best product for removing hair.  The first time was painful but well worth it.  I have tried waxing which I liked but was becoming very expensive.  My skin is also ultra sensitive and products like Nair would severely irritate my skin.  Shaving left me with tons of razor bumps since my hair is very coarse.  The Remington EP-1000 did not irritate my skin at all.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times and each time the hair did come back finer.  I wish I would have bought this product a long time ago.</li>
    <li> Just recieved this product and could not wait to try it. Unitill it touched my skin. The pain isn&#x27;t to bad since your leg will go numb after a few minutes. But the BAD part is ...when you look at your legs it only cut not even 1/2 of your hairs!!!!!!!!!! So you endure PAIN and your legs aren&#x27;t even smooth. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !! Don&#x27;t WASTE YOUR MONEY. I&#x27;m sending mine back !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so shocked that this item is not more expensive.  IT IS A MUST HAVE.  I used to wax and this does the same thing in 1/2 the time.  Yes, it is a little painful... who ever said that plucking hair from your body never was???  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product...if you wax or pay loads of money to have someone professional do it for you... save your $$$s and invest in one of these... YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT.</li>
    <li> everything ok. fair price, thank you for usinf the us postal service, keeps the postage down and everything else was just fine. Amazon is the place to shop. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using Phillips Satinelle over the past 10 years. When my epilator broke down, I panicked because this type (very fast working, not cutting the hairs and picking up even the shortest ones) is not easily found in the United States. I was happy to find Remington&#x27;s EP1000. It is very comparable to Satinelle, only with fewer wheels. It works well, noise is not too high and price was awesome. It hurts, just like any other hair \\&quot;extraction\\&quot;, but hair do grow thinner and appears to slightly decrease with time.</li>
    <li> Ok, i admit, it&#x27;s a feminine-looking thing, but weighed against hairy shoulders and back, i don&#x27;t give a damn.  I used to have my wife wax me, which would basically take the two of us an evening, but now i can do it myself (or most of it) in half the time.  I was suprised at how few hairs were broken instead of pulled.  And since i&#x27;m a man, i note the product is worth its price in the wax we&#x27;d spend over the life of the product.  So, gents, be not afraid of a bit of pain!  No woman likes a hairy back, no matter what she tells you!  (My wife has not yet tried it since she is overseas for the time being.)</li>
    <li> Alright I dont normally write reviews for items but I thought I would share my thoughts on this little machine. I bought it because I read all the other peoples reviews. I am currently deployed and I was getting tired of shaving every single day in the showers. So when I got this machine I was ready for the pain. I have to admit it did hurt. Especially around the ankle. It took me a while to do it but once I was finished I was so happy. The next time I used it it wasnt that bad. The trick is, is to do it often because it doesnt hurt. For all you ladies out there wondering about the bikini area... Alright I had the strength to do it. Now I didnt do the very low part.. But I did most of the area. IT WAS WELL WORTH THE PAIN!!! Im telling you if you suck up the pain for the first time you do it it will be well worth it. I use the epilator about every other day to keep the sparatic hair from growing. I havent had any bumps for over 2 months!! Its been so nice. Its smooth and it doesnt even hurt! I swear after you do the main part if you do it every couple of days it will be the best thing that you&#x27;ve ever done. Just think going to the beach not having to worry about razor burn! The hair stays away for over a week. I havent actually timed it but its a long time. Believe me the machine is worth it if you can take the pain! Hope the review helped!! Good luck!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this model as my first epilator of this type due to it&#x27;s low cost and decent reviews.  It&#x27;s ready to go right out of the package which is nice. It does require going over the same area a few times for complete hair removal.  On the plus side it is simple to use, not painful (nothing compared to waxing), not messy and actually does what it&#x27;s intended for. I love it and reccomend it for new users.</li>
    <li> It works very well, as I have no problem pulling out any hairs that long enough. Pain scale is varied from 0 to 6; I&#x27;m sure everyone can handle. The underarms are tricky as you have to hold the skin down tight, otherwise the device can grab your skin. It will stop automatically if that happens, but it&#x27;s hurt a bit (4-5). Using on thicker hairs or more sensitive skin will hurt more; i.e. bikini area can be painful for the first time (6). Good news is the pain goes down the next time you do it and the hair grows softer. Here&#x27;re some tips might be helpful: &lt;br /&gt;- Hair comes out easier when you pull the skin tight. &lt;br /&gt;- The on-off switch should be opposite the direction you are going. It&#x27;s more effective that way. But if you can&#x27;t handle the pain because it pulls out too many hairs at the same time, another direction might be better for you. &lt;br /&gt;- The easiest way to pick up a single hair is going sideway on top of it. The regular direction works better for more hairs. &lt;br /&gt;- The hairs on the bikini area are thick and tend to pull the device backward. When that happens the hair usually doesn&#x27;t come out and you are in more pain (but nothing you can&#x27;t handle.) So try to hold the device steady. &lt;br /&gt;- Apply soothing lotion afterward. It&#x27;ll help. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I said I love this thing. My skin becomes smoother for many days, and when hairs grow back they are softer comparing to after shaving. Plus, it&#x27;s very good investment.</li>
    <li> After reading all the wonderful comments about the Remington EP1000, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I followed the advice from past users and found that it did take most of my hair out!  I loved that part of it.  However, after a few days, when my hair started to grow back, I found a lot of ingrown hairs on my legs.  I tried using it again, but found more ingrown hairs than before.  Now, the Remington EP1000 is sitting in my closet and I have gone back to shaving...</li>
    <li> Purchased my first Remington EP1000 several years ago and when I needed to purchase another one, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in Hawaii!  My item arrived quickly and I can&#x27;t be more than pleased with it!  The price on Amazon was also cheaper than I paid for it years ago!  Definitely more than pleased!</li>
    <li> I just got mine and I&#x27;m very pleased.  I got it mainly for the bikini line area because I&#x27;m tired of having to get waxed.  It works just as well (maybe even better) as waxing - gets every single hair.  I experienced very little pain compared to waxing, but beware - if you&#x27;ve never had a wax before, you will find this very painful at first.  I tried it briefly on the legs but found it to be painful and it didn&#x27;t remove much hair - I could have been doing it wrong though.</li>
    <li> The Remington EP1000 performs as well or better than I expected it to.  I would definately recommend this product to my friends and aquaintances.</li>
    <li> Please dont go for this...it hurts like HELL...and my skin was burning/itching for a long time where it plucked my hair...  Epilators are supposed to be smooth...feel waxing is much better as it removes all the hair at once atleast...!! This one is too Terrible...!!  I returned this product...waiting for the money back..!!  I suggest people with sensitive skins not to go for this....!!</li>
    <li> Read the reviews,bought it at a great price and LOVE it.I&#x27;m 52 years young and wish I had this years ago!Was tingling at first,but in no time got used to it.Did both legs and and can&#x27;t say enough about how satisfied I am.I think the first time using it will be the worst,cause you dont know what to expect,but girls,try it,you will love it too.Great for facial hair too...</li>
    <li> If you cannot handle waxing the area you intend to use this on, don&#x27;t buy it. That said, this machine is fantastic. I have had it for two months. The first use was very painful and slow, the second really hurt but it gets better every time. I use this once or twice a week now and it goes pretty quickly. After the first month it became about as fast as shaving. I also find doing it just after drying off from a bath seems to keep the ingrown hairs to a minimum (maybe one or two). I have very sensitive skin and thick hair. I would have razor burn no matter what I did previously even with my regimen of spendy hypo algergenic shave gel, spendy venus razors and applying witchhazel afterward. With the smooth and silky machine I have no bumps or redness and my skin is indeed smooth and silky. What a deal too! This has already paid for itself with unused razors and shave gel not to mention the lack of razor burn.</li>
    <li> I have thick, dark hair on arms &amp; legs, and bought this product hoping it would slow down the growth (rather than just shaving it off DAILY).  Using it for the first time stung a bit, but I put up with the discomfort.  Am glad I did!  (It didn&#x27;t hurt so bad with subsequent uses).  My favorite spot to epilate: armpits!!  No more razor stubble -- smooth armpits (with no gray \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; from the stubble).  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I have had this epilator for over a year and it is my first and only one that I ever bought.  I have given up shaving my legs altogether after I got a handle on it because this epliator gives me such better results.  Now my legs are kept flawlessly smooth for 3 days and able to survive a whole week before need to epilate again.  It has lasted and lasted without any technical problems.  Even with regular use it has only caught my skin once and that was because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention.  For the price it really can&#x27;t be beat.  If you&#x27;re wondering what results to expect then ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the timeline breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First week will be the hardest took me forever to do my calves and was painful and left lots of small red bumps (disappeared the next day).  You also have to do it repeatedly over the next few days as your hair grows in from shaving. PLEASE do it after showering to maximize results and minimize pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple months I was able to stop doing it every 2 and 3 days and could wait a week.  My hair came in baby soft and fine.  I could let it go up to 2 weeks in the winter without my boyfriend feeling that much a difference (in the light no way I could get away with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 months I started getting the silky smooth feeling that is comparable to shaving.  (I noticed one review complaining that she doesn&#x27;t get it and that&#x27;s because you have to stick with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is a year into it and I epilate while watching T.V. and barely feel anything on my calves and only minor pain on my thighs.  I get the red bumps for a half hour afterwards but it disappears.  I no longer have ANY ingrown hairs and only shave my underarms and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars??  Well it is a bit small so it does take a minimum of a half hour to do both my legs.  It has no give or bend like those flexi razors so I do some crazy acrobatics to get the diffucult areas like behind my knees and thighs.  Plus I was expecting 4 to 6 weeks between epilations and I really only get 1 to 2.  Oh and cleaning can be a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me and had NEVER done epilation and are considering it just keep in mind this is NOT a review of epilating but one of the product.  Epilating takes a certain pain threshold, patience and dedication before you see rave results.  So if you wince just plucking your eyebrows stick to shaving.s expecting 4 to 6 weeks between epilations and I really only get 1 to 2.

    <li> This is not the best but it does take some hair off, however i couldn&#x27;t get over the pain long enough to actually find use out of it. I have mildly sensitive skin and it left little red blotches and bubbles on my skin. Don&#x27;t buy if your skin is the least bit sensitive or if you have a low tolerance for pain.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00005B6ZI Remington EP1000 Smooth &amp; Silky Epilator]]    I had a Philips epilator but wasnt satisfied.So I bought Remington 2 yrs back.And It works great.I dont have any problem with it.Only thing is you have to clean the blades in between use.I cant say this is a problem tho.</li>
    <li> I had the old Epilady and it was pretty painful. This epilator is so much better! I read the reviews and decided to make the purchase. I&#x27;m glad that I did. I&#x27;ve made sure to use it after a shower, keep the skin taught, and keep it at a 90 degree angle to my skin. It does the job well! (One warning, I just did it on my armpit last night and I wasn&#x27;t careful to keep the skin tight, so I did get a little \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot; if you can call it that. ) But I will recommend this product to many of my friends. I think that any woman should have one and throw those expensive disposable razors away!!! One more thing, some women aren&#x27;t able to handle a little pain/discomfort and the epilator isn&#x27;t pain-free, but pain is in the past and you&#x27;ll get over it. It&#x27;s really not that bad and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two different ones before (one from the Sharper Image, and another one was Brown), so I&#x27;ve got something to compare with. The Remington was the best - very efficient, so you don&#x27;t have to drag it many times over the same spot. And it does a very clean job. I believe other considerations are not that important. I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about all kind of hair removers - ladies are unhappy because the process is somewhat painful. But exuse me, how can you expect it not to be painful as you are pulling your live hair (remember wax?). Aren&#x27;t we women after all?</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator hair remover. I use it for my lip and nothing else.  It does hurt slightly because it is done in a very sensitive area but it is less painful than waxing.  I have not gone back to waxing since I bought this product. There is no irritation or redness like waxing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does take some practice but it is worth it. Just be patient and do it when not in a rush. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is a good product for the price. The only disadvantage is it is somewhat noisy.</li>
    <li> Yea, it hurts (mainly under my arms), but it works very very well.  It doesn&#x27;t really hurt on my legs at all, but it is pretty time consuming to get all the hair off the first few times. It probably works best on small areas, like the underarms, for this reason. Once your hair starts to grow back sparser and weaker, it works a lot faster. Be careful- the first time I used it under my arms, I burned myself because I held it too close to my skin for too long.  Its easy to use and maintain, and the benefits definitely outweigh the setbacks.</li>
    <li> This product is a must if you are one of those busy mom with a hectic schedule that has many unwanted hair and no time for the salon.  This product lets you remove unwanted hair in many areas at your own schedule and without the help of someone else.  No more running to the salon and feeling sticky from the wax.  This hair removal system does remove all unwanted hair and leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky.  It works well on the legs, bikini area, under arm, and mustache.  I can&#x27;t say the same for eye brows.  It also hurts and stings quite a bit when you first use it and does go away after a couple of usage.  If you had waxing done before, you know the pain I am refering to.  The hair takes a while to come back and I think that it varies for everyone.  It also comes back finer and lighter.  The price is also reasonable.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely efficient and easy to use.  It gets more hair than waxing, even baby fine ones.  I was surprised at how little it hurt when I first started using it, but there are certain areas that hurt more than others.  I had no problem with the bikini line, but around the bone in the front of my leg stung a little, and my knees were a little hard to navigate.  In flabby thigh areas I recommend pulling the skin kind of taut because I experienced a &amp;quot;fat pinch&amp;quot; lol.  I especially like it for the back of my thighs because the hair grows in so many different directions that shaving and waxing have been time consuming and not as effective.  This product is great and leaves legs silky without a mess, and the stinging lessens as you get used to it.  If your pain threshold is high or especially if you are already used to waxing, go ahead and try this and you can use it while you watch tv or something.</li>
    <li> After using the epilator for several weeks, I still have smooth legs. I have also used this great item on my face and neck. Being a fair-skinned female that has fought heavy facial hair for twenty years,it is great not to tweeze or shave every day.It is NOT painfree; it can deliver a sharp,quick bite(after all it is pulling stiff, wirey hair out by the root)but not bad most of the time,especially on the legs and face. Have had little trouble with ingrown hairs like with some products.Well worth the cost and effort of using.</li>
    <li> I am just so glad I bought this EP1000! I&#x27;m one of those people get really itchy after shaving or waxing.  I drag whenever I see hair coming back.  I was looking for an electric razor when I saw this thing with Gold.  So I thought I&#x27;ll try it and oh boy I just love it.  I use this to do my legs first.  At first, it stings (especially on the sensitive area), then I got the hang of it.  Then I see bumps and I thought I&#x27;m gonna be itchy all night.  It turns out my legs feel (and look) great and that I don&#x27;t need to scratch at all!  This saves so much money on shaver and wax.. definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> I had both this and the epilady and ended up giving this away because it didn&#x27;t quite work as expected.</li>
    <li> I am very familiar and have used hair removal systems for many years.  I was not happy with this system. It was by far the worst unit I have ever used.  It grabed and pinched my skin leaving large welts.  It happened when I least expected it.  It would go along smooth and then grab and pinch without warning.  I would never buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago because I was thinking about getting bikini waxed, but a little bit nervous about it.  So instead, I thought I would give this a try since the price was about the same as one waxing.  It works great!  Smarts a little, but I expected that and actually it hurts the most the first time you do it.  After that, it seems less sensitive.  Now I&#x27;m using it on my legs and my pits in addition to bikini area.  Feel so much more confident in a bikini now.  No shave stubble and very smooth.  I&#x27;ve been recommending it to my friends as a substitute to waxing.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  I haved tried many, many different kinds and I think I have finally found the one that works for me.  I have used cream hair removers, but they never seem to work how they advertise.  After using this shaver my legs are smooth and it last a long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it.  I returned even though I don&#x27;t get full refund.</li>
    <li> I have never had such a great time doing my legs.Ok I know how odd it sounds,but I think of the many cuts from shaving and &lt;br /&gt;red blotches from waxing I acquired over many years.I still have those lovely white areas to prove it.:( I recommend this  &lt;br /&gt;product highly.Please try,it&#x27;s worth every penny.:)Remmington &lt;br /&gt;always comes out with the very best products!:)</li>
    <li> After years of shaving my leg hair had gotten coarse and dark, but after one use the hair has already thinned.  It is significantly more painful to use on the underarms, but it&#x27;s possible and the results are immediately noticeable.</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago and have used it a couple of times.  I&#x27;m not real big on pain so when I first tried it I was very nervous because it looked like it was going to HURT.  It felt like the hairs were being pinched off my legs and I don&#x27;t know how this happened but I somehow managed to knick my legs a few times drawing blood.  The instructions say that if you have sensitive skin to use the product once a week but I decided to use it once every two weeks instead.  What disappoints me about this product is that it states you&#x27;ll be hair free for up to 4 to 6 weeks yet for me it&#x27;s more like one.  Granted the hair is sparse and my skin does feel smooth yet when I look at my legs there&#x27;s stubble.  I was really hoping to find something I could use as an alternative to shaving and that keeps me hair free for weeks.  I&#x27;ve tried waxing and I&#x27;ve gotten the same results with waxing as I do with the Remington.  At least the Remington isn&#x27;t messy like waxing.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this epilator for my bikini. It hurts a little the first few times, but the more you use it, the smoother the hairs so it hurts less. I used to get a bikini wax every 3 weeks, so thats about $25 a wax! Now I use this and I can say I wont go back to waxes! Its a real money saver. It does hurt, though. SO if you are not good with pain, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Its not as fast as a wax of course, so it takes a while to remove the hairs, and it hurts longer while doing it; while waxes hurt during the minutes they do it. Anyway, I dont regret buying it. I will try my legs soon, but for sure the bikini area hurts the most, and it lasts longer than shaving of course. I&#x27;ve had to use the epilator on the bikini right at 3 weeks later. Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I had been using epilators since past 3 years. I had a cordless one, but for the past 6 months was troubling a lot, so this time decided to go one with the corded operation. It&#x27;s working fine till now. The epilator is very effective. Overall a good purchase. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month and I love it. I&#x27;ll never use a razor again - especially for underarms. It works great on my legs and hair hasn&#x27;t grown back much at all. Just need touch ups. For the facial area  - chin &amp; upper lip - it isn&#x27;t quite as easy to completely get all the hairs with different curves, etc. Still have to pluck some - but it is a start.  I am really amazed with the bikini area - how much less and lighter hair growns back. (Now I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to use it for a COMPLETE shave in that area (see clump of skin warning below) - but for an upper cleaning - it is GREAT!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does create a sensation like tiny little shocks as it grabs the hair. But nothing you can&#x27;t tolerate, or any worse than scraping (and cutting yourself) with a razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long this will work effectively - but for about $38 -- I could buy a new one every year and it would be well worth it. I&#x27;m getting my daughter one! Word of caution - do be careful around folds of skin - you DON&#x27;T want it to catch a clump of skin -- that really hurts. I had a nasty jolt once when shaving the back of my leg when it was bent. Pull your skin as taut as you can to avoid this! On the facial area - be sure to pull your head hair back out of the way -- if it gets ahold of some of that long hair accidently - ouch! I sure wish I&#x27;d had one of these for the last 40 years -- I&#x27;d have a lot less scars!</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator and I have owned it for more than a year now...I have had no problems with it so far and I am planning to buy another one. I suggested it to 2 of my other friends and they loved it too. You can use it for upper lips, under arms, legs and arms and it just great. It hurts a little when you have sensitive skin but that&#x27;s bearable...less painful than threading your upper lips! I bought it for 25 bucks and now its a little expensive...they should reduce the price a bit (40 is good).</li>
    <li> This epilator is reasonable painless, easy to use, compact and pretty in its carrying case.  However, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, even after repeated, long-term use.  It&#x27;s perfect for parts of your body that don&#x27;t need to be perfectly smooth but where you just want less hair.</li>
    <li> The pain of beauty. Hurts in the beginning but gets easier the more often you use it. Hair grows back finer and slower.</li>
    <li> This is just okay. It does pull the hair but it will also pull your skin with it if you&#x27;re not careful. There are definitely better alternatives out there.</li>
    <li> I admit I was a bit hesitant in buying this because I had heard so many stories about the other kinds.  This works great and removes all hair-short, long and in-between.  One caution though:  stretch the skin before you do this as in around the knees-it has a tendency to grab the skin-no major damage, but it did sting.  Also it does work on the underarms which is a great deal to me as I have arthritis and it is difficult for me to shave there.  Same caution here though--tighten any skin or past scar tissue--it grabbed my skin twice.  Otherwise this is great.  It keeps the hair off legs, underarms, etc for at least three weeks.&lt;BR&gt;Recommend it highly</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;BR&gt;I am a woman who in recent years has found little facial hair&#x27;s&lt;BR&gt;that have become a problem.  I know there are alot of you out there, and it is not easy to talk about. There is alot more unwanted hair out there besides legs and armpits. &lt;BR&gt;Now let me tell you ladies, this little item is wonderful. A couple, (about 10), of my little unwanted hair&#x27;s were quite stiff from being plucked for so long. Now they take forever to grow back and are  soft! I just can&#x27;t believe it!  Thanks to Remington for this little jewel.&lt;BR&gt;It takes alittle practice but sooooo worth it. Hang in there...&lt;BR&gt;                       Sincerely, Joni</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past two years and it has been working satisfactorily. It does break hair sometimes so they do grow back sooner than a week but it is much better than shaving which irritates my skin a lot. Under-arms results are much better than on the legs (where the hair breaks more often.) It works better after a shower and some exfoliation when all the ingrown hair are out and skin is soft.&lt;BR&gt;Over all easy to clean and durable. &lt;BR&gt;I have the model which is not rechargeable (works only with the cord.) I recommend that model becuase rechargeables usually lose power after sometime requiring you to replace the battery.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this hair removal system.  I am very impressed.  I have been using it on my legs once a week for about a month now, and I can see that after a week there is much less hair than you would usually see after a few days.  The theory is that by removing the hair by the roots, it grows back finer and more sparse.  This seems to be the case.  I tried it on my underarms, and it was torture, so I will continue to use my Intuition on that area.  It truly is not painful like the Epilady was...(remember that, anyone)...there is no comparison to that system.  I plan to keep using this system, and feel that one day my legs will be close to permanently hair free....by the way...I compared, and Amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> and your good to go. Numbs the pain, and worth the time saved from not having to shave in the shower everyday. Love the job it does under my arms!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington EP 100 after having used the Emjoy Gold until it quit working. I am very happy with the results of the hair removal system. It works well if you take your time and go over the area repeatedly. My legs are so soft and smooth since I have been using this type of hair removal system I would never consider going back to shaving or waxing. I am also pleased that the price of the Remigton was much less than the Emjoy Gold.</li>
    <li> This is much less painful than Emjoi gold cordless. And much cheaper too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not repeating how good this is and worth for the price, but just wanted to give a few tips not mentined in the product manual. For small red bumps, just use aloe vera gel (pure is better.. such as Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera 100% Gel) or any good lotion (such as Neutrogena bump minizing lotion with SPF 15), and the next day, those bumps are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is \\&quot;personal care\\&quot; item, i.e. for yourself only. One time, my aunt used my shaving item without letting me know and I didn&#x27;t know that until I got read bumps with white heads. If you love your skin, especially you&#x27;ve sensitive skin, keep all your personal care items for yourself.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I purchased this item, as it is so difficult to find this kind of hair remover in stores (anyone knows a place where to find it except online?).  But the first use is going to be the only one and the last one, as I was very disappointed by the performances of this system.  It had difficulties to grab hair, even long hair, and I had to go over the same area several times (not just a couple of times), which is not good for skin irritation!  And now that the hair is growing back, I&#x27;m even more disappointed, as many grow back under the skin or even form an irritation/spot. &lt;br /&gt;I have used many electrical hair removers and this is the first one to give such disappointing results! Sorry, but I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> The Smooth and silky hair removal system does just as it says.  It&#x27;s not painless, but no where NEAR the pain of waxing, and is much better than shaving!  I&#x27;ve used it on my bikini line, and it worked extremely well.  I am thoroughly satisfied with this product, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick easy, long lasting, hair removal product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago from Amazon after reading all of the reviews twice . . . I had been shaving with a hand held razor for years and blades were expensive.  I am 50 years old and it was past time for something new.  One of my friends said to try an epilator, but I remember my daughter trying one once in the 80&#x27;s . . .I can still remember her screams, but I thought I would try it for myself.  It did take a couple of days of getting use to the feel of it and you do have to pull the skin taunt (for those of us who no longer have taunt skin), however, I do not know how I ever got along without it -- I shower, pat myself dry, use the Remington EP1000 (there is always one spot or another that needs it every couple of days)-- I apply lotion afterwards and I have smooth skin -- easily 5 stars</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful epilator that does a great job on removing facial hair.  It does not hurt like other epilators I have used in the past.  I use this on my upper lip area, chin area and hands. It is gentle, quiet and gets those little hairs easily.  I recommend this one for the sensitive areas on your face and I plan on trying it out on other areas of the body.  I am very happy with this one and it is cheaper than the last one I had bought.  Thank you Remington!!</li>
    <li> This item works. Definitely worth it if you have tried other products and have not had success. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Recommend a strong buy.</li>
    <li> This hair remover works whenever it catches the hair. The problem is that the tweezers are aligned, so it only catches 1/2 the hair in one pass. It takes many passes to tweeze it all, so I rate it only 3 stars; my previous hair remover (a Braun) had non-aligned tweezers that removed all the hair in a single pass. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is probably why this Remington hair remover is inexpensive. It does the job, if you have a lot of time on your hands.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Remington EP1000 for several months now and love the results. With every use my hair grows back slower, thinner, and sometimes not at all! The first use it a toughy but if you can make it through the results are so worth it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Yes it hurts - but not as much as those slices I used to shave out of the backs of my ankles with my razor. I will never go back to razors! lovely easy product and wonderful results. smooth skin for weeks and returning hair is much lighter and it hurts less and less each time you use it</li>
    <li> This product is better than other products of the same line. And the 24 carat gold feature is good and makes it more durable, but I think razor and wax are the painless option and come cheap. It pulls the hair out which makes the whole process painful especially imagine at the places like bikini lines etc. But since the gold is the metal that gives that antibiotic feature with it I think its a good. And if you are brave enough than I think pricing is very good at amazon.com. It does give you a good smooth legs.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Of course it hurts a bit... but once you get used to the sensation, it&#x27;s a very quick means of hair removal.  It&#x27;s small enough that it can be used in the space between eyebrows, though it is unlikely to get tiny hairs that may just barely appear a while after tweezing.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Leg hairs might pose a bit of a problem depending on thickness and density... I found that by the time mine were long enough to epilate again, they were a bit too visible for comfort if I wanted to wear shorts in the meantime.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You will want a luffa if you intend to epilate regularly, or you will wind up with ingrown hairs that will never get epilated.  This and the leg hair issue are more an obstacle for epilators in general--as an epilator, this particular model works very well, but epilators are not the be-all end-all of hair removal.  The trusty old razor is still the simplest and most effective (and cheapest), albeit less permanent, means of home hair removal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That said, this epilator works great for small areas like the bikini line, the odd mole/nipple hair, and other less dense hair areas.  I don&#x27;t know if I could recommend using this for a full removal of abdominal hair, I&#x27;m too scared to try... but it may be possible on the less sensitive areas a while after shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used epiladys for years.  Finally decided to try this one for the newest area, my chin.  Yes, it hurts at first, but does a great job overall.  Considering I only have to epilady my legs and chin once a month.. it&#x27;s worth it!  Compared to the orginal epilady that I have, this one is quieter, easier to use, and does a better job plucking the hairs.  I highly recommend it if you can deal with the plucking pain.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year. I thought I had lost it, so ordered a new one --&amp; promptly found my old epilator. However, it&#x27;s such a great device that I am happy to have a back-up. It hurt a little the 1st few times I used it, but unlike waxing it didn&#x27;t burn &amp; I could stop &amp; let myself relax before continuing on. By about the 3rd or 4th time of using it, the only parts that were still sensitive on my legs were the ankles &amp; knees. I tried waxing &amp; found it to be too painful, while shaving just resulted in dry, itchy skin. This epliator has been fantastic &amp; I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends, who have also been surprised by the lack of pain.</li>
    <li> This was my first epilator; I have both shaved and waxed. Shaving is a pain (particularly for bikini area) and made other areas dry. Waxing was better, but I disliked waiting for the hair to get long enough to wax again. Yes, the first time I epilated it hurt, and I took my time, spacing it out over a few days. After that, I do \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot; a few times a week, and it just tickles. As they promised the hair grows back thinner, softer and lighter. My hair is very dark and my legs look so much nicer with the epilator! I can&#x27;t see dark dots growing back.  I use it on my underarms, bikini area, and legs. Fleshy areas (inner thighs etc) are harder to work on, as the skin must be stretched taut or it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I find that on the fleshy areas I have a few ingrown hairs and am more likely to have temporary bumps, like a razor burn. Tips: 1. Make absolutely sure the skin is taut. 2. Exfoliate after use. 3.Don&#x27;t just go up the leg like a razor, make very, very slow circular motions with the EP1000 parallel to body. 4.Throw razor away forever!</li>
    <li> Yes, it pulls, but yes, it does work as long as you keep at it.  The problem is that suddenly I had TONS of ingrown hairs when the hair started to grow back!!  Do you know how hard it is to get rid of those????  I had to sit there with tweezers and pull them out one by one because they grow just under a layer of skin.  I ended up having to go back to my razor.  If you don&#x27;t want to be bothered with something like that, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I used a coil Epilady back in the 80ties and IT WAS PAINFUL!!!! This particuliar Epilator has a little sting but works great IF you follow the instructions!!!! My only vice is that if you grab a fold of skin....OUCH!!!! It has worked wonders on my legs but please take note: afterwards you will have red bumps just like the process after plucking your eyebrows. The bumps will fade in less then 24 hours and you will be left with baby soft smooth legs. I have yet to try this product on my armpits and bikini area. I would definantly recommend the Remington EP1000 Smooth &amp; Silky Epilator to every woman. It comes with an adaptor,  nice little storage pouch, and cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 5 or 6 years now. It is still going strong and works great! I will definitely buy the same thing again.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington EP1000 as my first ever epilator about ten years ago, and it&#x27;s only just now worn out. I only use it on my lower legs as epilating or waxing elsewhere is too painful for me. I really like this epilator because it&#x27;s corded so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a battery dying. It&#x27;s fairly effective although it doesn&#x27;t get the finer hairs and still leaves a few even after multiple passes, but the hairs it misses are so fine and short that I can leave them. It&#x27;s much more effective than shaving; I epilate once per week and it hardly hurts and only takes 20 minutes. There&#x27;s also noticeably less hair regrowing even after a long winter without epilating. Compared to waxing, shaving, and depilatories, this is faster, cheaper, and more effective.</li>
    <li> It works great when I use it...sometimes I get lazy and shave my legs and then I have to start the process over. Once you use it, the hair does grow back much lighter. It sometimes can hurt a little depending where you use it. But, it&#x27;s the best option I&#x27;ve found yet (waxing is just too expensive). You can use on your face, but be careful. Can pinch skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
