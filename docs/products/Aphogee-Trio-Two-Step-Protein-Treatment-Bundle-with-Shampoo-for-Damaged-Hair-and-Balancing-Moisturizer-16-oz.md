      <li>Aphogee has been wonderful in bringing it back to its healthy state.  </li>
      <li>I just love that I found it online as a set</li>
      <li>but it was nothing more than a non lingering medicinal smell.</li>
      <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All the products I have used so far have been great.  </li>

      <li>Love how it make my hair feel, nice and soft !</li>
      <li>This stuff smells so good plus it makes my hair feel so super soft.</li>
      <li>worth the price</li>
      <li>and he is right.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use Aphogee as long as the product is available; I love it.  </li>
      <li>Work wonders, stopped breakage after first use.</li>
      <li>If you are interested in the mizani products look up their hair wheel on google</li>
      <li>I love the 2 minute moisture balance and shampoo for regular washings!  </li>
      <li>Also it was not expensive.</li>
      <li>because buying everything separately in the store is pretty pricey...</li>
      <li>Color treating my hair for many years and personal stress that comes with age, my hair needed help.</li>
      <li>After the first use my hair was soft, smooth, and managable.  </li>
      <li>I was able to run a comb through it (gently) with only having a couple of hairs break off.</li>
      <li>It gets your hair more dry...</li>
      <li>Your hair might prefer more or less protein than mine, but the wheel I mentioned helps you figure out what mixture ratio is right for you)</li>
      <li>Follow the directions to the letter, and your hair will not break as much.  </li>
      <li>The whole experience I didn&#x27;t like...</li>
      <li>and yes it really does what it says.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t ready to throw in the towel though, and instead of chopping everything off decided to do some research, and that research brought me to discover Aphogee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes my hair much softer and easier to detangle.</li>
      <li>But I would really recommend trying this and sticking with it.</li>
      <li>I did the 1st step and didn&#x27;t see too much difference.</li>
      <li>The protein treatment is easy to do but you have to follow up with the balancing moisturizer to prevent your hair from being dry.</li>
      <li>The result was that my hair was breaking of in clumps, particularly around my face.</li>
      <li>Also, I did try eating a little better -</li>
      <li>I have fine 4C natural hair and struggle with single strand knots and split ends.</li>
      <li>I ended up leaving the Two Step Treatment in for about 45 minutes total (took 20 minutes to dry with the blow dryer) and the moisturizer in for about an hour (I ended up applying more mid-time</li>
      <li>With the combination of these products, it is growing back healthy, thicker and quicker than I expected.</li>
      <li>hair feels so soft after using the protein treatment and the conditioner!</li>
      <li>I used this product just once so far.</li>
      <li>If you are protein sensitive this is not the product for you.</li>
      <li>It also did tingle near my nape.&lt;br</li>
      <li>- I think it&#x27;s a waste - that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s free.</li>
      <li>hair is nowhere near completely healed.</li>
      <li>It arrived on time and it was exactly what i expected.</li>
      <li>The shampoo alone makes your hair dry and hard to comb,,,, it&#x27;s ok if you put the conditioner..</li>
      <li>I had extremely damaged, dry, colored, and super frizzy hair by the time I tried this product.</li>
      <li>product is just waaaaay too messy to have to deal with and the mizani line is definitely easier to use and just as effective if not better.</li>
      <li>I have thick dry coarse hair that is now healthy because of Aphogee.</li>
      <li>texture of my hair did feel different, not dry, but courser.</li>
      <li>/&gt;(I am relaxed (chemically straightened), and I use about 3/4 cups of the strengthening treatment (protein), and 1 cup of the moisture treatment, and mix those together, and use that mixture once a month, and for the other 3 weeks of the month (since i do hair treatments once a week), I just deep condition like normal.  </li>

<li> Love this stuff but the price is ridiculous!!</li>
<li> and it feels weird to blow dry a product to your hair so that your hair is hard, but if you can get through the process, I instantly noticed shiny and healthy hair after just my first use.</li>
<li> I read the other reviews on this product from several different places.  </li>
<li> My natural hair was damaged a few years ago.</li>
<li> The smell is awful, but my hair felt really good after!</li>
<li> /&gt;It took about 25 mins for the protein treatment to completely dry under the bonnet dryer.  </li>
<li> You must read the instructions carefully before using as the Protein treatment leaves your hair quite dry.</li>
<li> I have been suffering from breakage over the last few years so wanted to try a protein</li>
<li> With just a few weeks I have noticed a big difference in the strength and managability.</li>
<li> I have chin length type 4C thick and course natural hair.</li>
<li> I also get less split ends and single strand knots.</li>
<li> used a SLS free shampoo and not the one provided since it contains SLS.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the protein treatment does not smell that bad.</li>
<li> Less breakage.</li>
<li> I wash my hair at least three times a week and after months of this my hair was dry, brittle, and lifeless.  </li>
<li> But then I used the shampoo every time for a little over 2 months and one day my boyfriend (who never notices anything) said &amp;#34;wow</li>
<li> It became heat damaged a few months ago.</li>
<li> As expected, it did make my hair extremely hard and it was a bit hard to wash all the product</li>
<li> Raw Shea Butter Restorative conditioner - 12 oz.]].&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my roots touched up (bleached) this past weekend and assumed the stylist knew what she was doing.</li>
<li> I was searching the Internet for something that could help me at least for the time being.  </li>
<li> common sense tells me it did.</li>
<li> Well I will swear by this product, I bought this product when my hair was dropping out badly, and I used this product as directed and my hair grew back stronger and longer.</li>
<li> My hair was broken off from wearing wool hats during winter.</li>
<li> If your hair is terribly damaged, I&#x27;d definitely try this pack.</li>
<li> WRONG.</li>
<li> BAD-</li>
<li> It smells awful...</li>
<li> and it does NOT  have a horrible smell.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After reading some reviews I was worried about using this on my hair as one review said that the persons hair fell out/broke off.  Just read the instructions serveral times like I did and you will be fine.  I wish I would have found this treatment months ago as I am in the sun, out on the boat etc.  It works wonders.</li>
    <li> Love how it make my hair feel, nice and soft !</li>
    <li> Aphogee will save your hair and stop breakage in its tracks. The protein treatment is easy to do but you have to follow up with the balancing moisturizer to prevent your hair from being dry. I will always use these products especially immediately after and 1 week before my relaxer. Never have damaged, breaking hair again!---Mckinlia Laphand</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews on this product from several different places.  This product is wonderful IF USED CORRECTLY and it does NOT  have a horrible smell.  My hair is in wonderful condition after using this product.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever move away from it!  I am an African American woman and I work out daily.  I wash my hair at least three times a week and after months of this my hair was dry, brittle, and lifeless.  I was searching the Internet for something that could help me at least for the time being.  After the first use my hair was soft, smooth, and managable.  All this after me not having had a relaxer for 10 weeks!!!  I love the conditioner!  I love the 2 minute moisture balance and shampoo for regular washings!  If you are looking for a hair rescue...this is your product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t give many 5 stars... but this stuff works. I had extremely damaged, dry, colored, and super frizzy hair by the time I tried this product. I did the 1st step and didn&#x27;t see too much difference. But then I used the shampoo every time for a little over 2 months and one day my boyfriend (who never notices anything) said &amp;#34;wow your hair is amazing&amp;#34;. and he is right. my hair is now magazine nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t bother with the Aphogee conditioner - I think it&#x27;s a waste - that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s free. I like Aussie Moist. But I would really recommend trying this and sticking with it. Also, I did try eating a little better - so I don&#x27;t know if that had an effect but common sense tells me it did. And for extra health I use argon oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good plus it makes my hair feel so super soft. I haven&#x27;t used the protein treatment yet.</li>
    <li> Well I will swear by this product, I bought this product when my hair was dropping out badly, and I used this product as directed and my hair grew back stronger and longer.</li>
    <li> My natural hair was damaged a few years ago. Aphogee has been wonderful in bringing it back to its healthy state.  It became heat damaged a few months ago. I know Aphogee will bring it back again.</li>
    <li> Work wonders, stopped breakage after first use. Great treatment</li>
    <li> It works awesome in my hair!!! I feel my hair very smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Great combination for my hair. I recommended.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. I have fine 4C natural hair and struggle with single strand knots and split ends. I use this system every 6 weeks as a part of my hair caare regime. It makes my hair much softer and easier to detangle. I also get less split ends and single strand knots. You must read the instructions carefully before using as the Protein treatment leaves your hair quite dry. Deep conditioning after is a must for me. Additionally I always detangle my hair before and after the treatment. If you are protein sensitive this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> The smell is awful, but my hair felt really good after!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no newbie to the Aphogee treatments. Its apart of my regular hair care routine for about 2 years now and yes it really does what it says. I just love that I found it online as a set because buying everything separately in the store is pretty pricey...worth the price but who doesn&#x27;t want to save money?? :-)</li>
    <li> Love it...smells great and it works wonders for my bleached blond and relaxed hair!!!</li>
    <li> I loved it, it´s a great hair product. It arrived on time and it was exactly what i expected. Also it was not expensive.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great product and received on time.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for my fine curly hair. With just a few weeks I have noticed a big difference in the strength and managability. Less breakage. If I had to say one thing that needs improvement would be to help with the freezies. But I am paitent. Color treating my hair for many years and personal stress that comes with age, my hair needed help. This product does work.</li>
    <li> I have chin length type 4C thick and course natural hair. I have been suffering from breakage over the last few years so wanted to try a protein treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I used a SLS free shampoo and not the one provided since it contains SLS.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the protein treatment does not smell that bad. Maybe they changed the formula but it was nothing more than a non lingering medicinal smell. It also did tingle near my nape.&lt;br /&gt;It took about 25 mins for the protein treatment to completely dry under the bonnet dryer.  As expected, it did make my hair extremely hard and it was a bit hard to wash all the product out.&lt;br /&gt;I *thought* I washed out all the protein and continued with the 2 minute moisturizer and did a deep moisture treatment with [[ASIN:B0038TYTI4 Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative conditioner - 12 oz.]].&lt;br /&gt;As I was blowing out my hair I noticed all these white flakes and a patch in the middle where the hair sort of matted together. So now I have to rewash to get rid of these flakes.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of my hair did feel different, not dry, but courser. Hope this stops the breakage I will see how my hair reacts over the next 2 months.</li>
    <li> These products do their job but if I knew about the mizani Strengthening/Moisturizing line before I bought this it would have saved me some money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is just waaaaay too messy to have to deal with and the mizani line is definitely easier to use and just as effective if not better. If you are interested in the mizani products look up their hair wheel on google so you can find out how to use the Strengthening/Moisturizing line most effectively for your hair needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I am relaxed (chemically straightened), and I use about 3/4 cups of the strengthening treatment (protein), and 1 cup of the moisture treatment, and mix those together, and use that mixture once a month, and for the other 3 weeks of the month (since i do hair treatments once a week), I just deep condition like normal.  Your hair might prefer more or less protein than mine, but the wheel I mentioned helps you figure out what mixture ratio is right for you)</li>
    <li> This combo saved me a lot of overhead cost compared to&lt;br /&gt;having it done in a salon.  Very good deal</li>
    <li> It smells awful... and it feels weird to blow dry a product to your hair so that your hair is hard, but if you can get through the process, I instantly noticed shiny and healthy hair after just my first use. If your hair is terribly damaged, I&#x27;d definitely try this pack.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use Aphogee as long as the product is available; I love it.  All the products I have used so far have been great.  I only wish they made a relaxer.</li>
    <li> My hair was broken off from wearing wool hats during winter. With the combination of these products, it is growing back healthy, thicker and quicker than I expected.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely AMAZING. I&#x27;m so friggin&#x27; happy I could cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my roots touched up (bleached) this past weekend and assumed the stylist knew what she was doing. WRONG. The result was that my hair was breaking of in clumps, particularly around my face. I couldn&#x27;t comb or run my fingers through my hair without pulling out chunks of hair. I was literally in tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t ready to throw in the towel though, and instead of chopping everything off decided to do some research, and that research brought me to discover Aphogee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only changes I made to the instructions were the time I left each product in.  I ended up leaving the Two Step Treatment in for about 45 minutes total (took 20 minutes to dry with the blow dryer) and the moisturizer in for about an hour (I ended up applying more mid-time wait bc my hair was soaking it up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is nowhere near completely healed. It&#x27;s going to take a couple more treatments for that to happen, but now I can run my fingers through my hair without coming away with tons of hair. I was able to run a comb through it (gently) with only having a couple of hairs break off. THIS IS HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also went ahead and purchased the Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor to use in between treatments.</li>
    <li> I used this product just once so far.</li>
    <li> The whole experience I didn&#x27;t like... It gets your hair more dry... The shampoo alone makes your hair dry and hard to comb,,,, it&#x27;s ok if you put the conditioner.. But why you do that to yourself??!!!&lt;br /&gt;The protein made my hair much dryer with more CURLS !!!  At the end can anybody tells me what is the benefit of this system?!</li>
    <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels so soft after using the protein treatment and the conditioner!</li>
    <li> Great product! It does what it advertises it will do. The end result is wonderful looking hair.</li>
    <li> Hi All,&lt;br /&gt;Although this products smells BAD- It does the job.  Follow the directions to the letter, and your hair will not break as much.  I have thick dry coarse hair that is now healthy because of Aphogee.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why the cost of this has gone up so drastically,  even in hair stores like Sally but this was a great value and I will get it again when I need it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff but the price is ridiculous!! In my nearest beauty supply store it&#x27;s 20 bucks... Glad I didn&#x27;t purchase this!</li>
    <li> I had no used protein treatment for years. When I used it again got the same excellent results. made my hair glow</li>
