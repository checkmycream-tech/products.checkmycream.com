      <li>I really love them and will buy again!</li>
      <li>I love these replacements...especially the price!</li>
      <li>The cost is excellent and I received them in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>So when I clicked on the link they had provided to give my HONEST results my review was removed.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased with this purchase and will return to this vendor when I need more brushes.</li>
      <li>Wow, excellent dupes for Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>and I noticed no difference between this one and the name brand one which is much more expense.  </li>
      <li>All they ask is that change my review when I see how great their product really is.  </li>
      <li>and I love it however</li>
      <li>shipping and service were top notch, as well.</li>
      <li>I like them even better than the name brand ones.</li>
      <li>And I still get that wonderful soft and clean feeling after washing my face with it  :)</li>
      <li>These fit nicely on my Mia 2 perfectly, but are a little rougher bristles.</li>
      <li>A super substitute for the Clarisonic brand---what a savings!</li>
      <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s more than an adequate replacement.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic price.</li>
      <li>The brush fit well</li>
      <li>works just as fine as the original, just a tad bit softer.</li>
      <li>Once we got that worked out, it worked just as well as the original</li>
      <li>garbage, the Clarisonic were perfect as usual.</li>
      <li>Just like original for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>I will never again pay full price for these replacement heads.</li>
      <li>#34;why does this product have such good reviews?&amp;#34;  I also wrote, &amp;#34; this product feels like your using a cotton ball on your face, just moosh</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t tell a difference except for in my wallet :-)</li>
      <li>but this brush was better than that one, as it is  fuller and more similar to the name brand brush.  </li>
      <li>They have an exact fit on my Clarisonic</li>
      <li>Works just fine and certainly affordable.</li>
      <li>Two main things: the bristles are longer and it makes more noise when using (more than likely because the fit isn&#x27;t exact).</li>
      <li>It fit my Mia very well.</li>
      <li>So happy to find this replacement brush for half the cost!</li>
      <li>These are a great value replacement over the more expensive name brand Clarisonic heads.  </li>
      <li>Is soft enough for sensitive skin and works beautifully.</li>
      <li>I actually was delaying the appropriate changing of the head just to save money.</li>
      <li>Ok so I&#x27;m usually really funny about generic products.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the Clarisonic brand other than the price.</li>
      <li>These brushes are as good, if not better, than Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>It just simply works fine.</li>
      <li>but you can&#x27;t really complain given the price.</li>
      <li>I am very happing with the replacement brushes for my Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
      <li>Even better than expected!  </li>
      <li>They work about the same as the others, but I will say that I can tell the difference in the original and these.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m back to getting that truly clean feeling when removing my makeup at night.</li>
      <li>After posting that review I was contacted by the company and they offered to send me a new set of brush heads along with a set of genuine Clarisonic brush heads so that I would see for myself they are the same.  </li>
      <li>Cleanses just as well as the brand name brush heads, however I&#x27;m not sure if they are fitted as well to my Clarisonic Mia 2 as they should be, because I hear a bit of rattling despite twisting the new brush heads to insure a secure fit.</li>
      <li>It was a bit of a challenge to figure out how to get the smaller inner brush to stay on - it has to be clicked into place, something my husband was able to fix.</li>
      <li>Only you can decide if it will be worth the difference in cost.  </li>
      <li>These are exactly the same item for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>And at this price, I can change out those heads frequently to maintain their cleansing ability.</li>
      <li>Not really a secure fit.</li>
      <li>pleasantly surprised with them</li>
      <li>The difference is too subtle to describe and it will be a cost to value issue for most people.</li>
      <li>works great - just as advertised and much less expensive than getting the clarisonic branded brushes.</li>
      <li>I can barely tell a difference between these and the much more expensive brand.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find a less expensive replacement brush!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Even better than expected!  I actually prefer them to the original/brand name ones.</li>
    <li> This replacement brush head is very good. It fit my Mia very well. The cost is excellent and I received them in a very timely manner. I will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> works great - just as advertised and much less expensive than getting the clarisonic branded brushes. shipping and service were top notch, as well.</li>
    <li> Cleanses just as well as the brand name brush heads, however I&#x27;m not sure if they are fitted as well to my Clarisonic Mia 2 as they should be, because I hear a bit of rattling despite twisting the new brush heads to insure a secure fit. This is the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this item with 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service.  The brush heads work just as well as the name brand at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are as good as the originals. I really can&#x27;t tell a difference except for in my wallet :-) pleasantly surprised with them</li>
    <li> I have been using a Clarisonic for years and paying a lot for replacement brushes.  I gave these a try and to my surprise they work and feel like the more expensive brushes.  I also use their sonic tooth brush replacement heads.</li>
    <li> These fit nicely on my Mia 2 perfectly, but are a little rougher bristles. The bristle tips may not be polished and rounded like the originals.</li>
    <li> These brushes are as good, if not better, than Clarisonic.  I really love them and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fantastic price. Not as firm as the Clarisonic heads but you can&#x27;t really complain given the price.</li>
    <li> Clatter a bit when using.  Not really a secure fit.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate. Why pay $27 at the Mall?  Great product; they fit my Mia perfectly.</li>
    <li> I am very happing with the replacement brushes for my Clarisonic.  The brush fit well and I noticed no difference between this one and the name brand one which is much more expense.  I tried another generic brush that was a little cheaper too but this brush was better than that one, as it is  fuller and more similar to the name brand brush.  I have used my brush for several weeks and it is holding up well.  Very pleased with this purchase and will return to this vendor when I need more brushes.</li>
    <li> Wow, excellent dupes for Clarisonic. I will be buying these instead of the expensive name version. I cannot find any difference other than the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent affordable replacement head for my clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
    <li> Definitely a must get. The Sonimart brush fits on perfectly with my Clarisonic 2.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Clarisonic brushes!</li>
    <li> Will never buy any other brushes.  These are great, and so cost effective.</li>
    <li> These work great on my Clarisonic Mia 2.  It makes a little rattling noise when in use, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an issue.  I will buy these again!</li>
    <li> works great, no issues.</li>
    <li> They worked just great !!  I will be ordering them again !!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Fits my Mia perfectly. Is soft enough for sensitive skin and works beautifully. Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> Just like original for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Works like a charm with my clarisonic mia.</li>
    <li> works just as fine as the original, just a tad bit softer.</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;m usually really funny about generic products. I have a Clarisonic that I have used for quite some time now and I love it however the price of their replacement brush heads seems quite outrageous. I actually was delaying the appropriate changing of the head just to save money. These replacement brush heads work perfectly. They have an exact fit on my Clarisonic and I&#x27;m back to getting that truly clean feeling when removing my makeup at night. And at this price, I can change out those heads frequently to maintain their cleansing ability. Definitely will be continuing to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re perfect. I can barely tell a difference between these and the much more expensive brand. I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> Only you can decide if it will be worth the difference in cost.  The product is as described and works well on my Mia.  Compared to the official Clarisonic &amp;#34;normal brush head,&amp;#34; these bristles are little softer.  Also, as others mentioned there is a small rattle, and I wonder if it makes a difference in effectiveness of the sonic function.  But for the price, it&#x27;s more than an adequate replacement.  Give it a try.  The difference is too subtle to describe and it will be a cost to value issue for most people.</li>
    <li> I will never again pay full price for these replacement heads. These are exactly the same item for a fraction of the price. They work perfectly with the Clarisonic unit and shipping was speedy. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and works fine.  The price is really good compared to the brand name.  Will buy it again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is very bad. I wrote a previous review and I asked, &amp;#34;why does this product have such good reviews?&amp;#34;  I also wrote, &amp;#34; this product feels like your using a cotton ball on your face, just moosh, it also does not vibrate as a Clarisonic brush does.  Which is important.&amp;#34;  After posting that review I was contacted by the company and they offered to send me a new set of brush heads along with a set of genuine Clarisonic brush heads so that I would see for myself they are the same.  Hmmm.  All they ask is that change my review when I see how great their product really is.  I thought, this is a great company.  When I received them, I tried them and it was like night and day. Their brush heads, these, for $10 were like cotton mush, garbage, the Clarisonic were perfect as usual. So when I clicked on the link they had provided to give my HONEST results my review was removed.  I GUESS NOW I KNOW HOW THESE REVIEWS ARE ALL SO GREAT.  They buy them.  I&#x27;m not sure how many of you will see the truth about these because honestly, I never read long reviews. Hmmm</li>
    <li> I got these as a replacement for my Mia. They work about the same as the others, but I will say that I can tell the difference in the original and these. Two main things: the bristles are longer and it makes more noise when using (more than likely because the fit isn&#x27;t exact). I can&#x27;t say that I would or wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
    <li> These are a great value replacement over the more expensive name brand Clarisonic heads.  The heads snap on and fit perfectly with the Clarisonic body and they function perfectly.  The reason that I&#x27;m giving this item 4 starts is because the bristles are a little stiff when compared to the name brand heads.  However, I think that they should soften up over time.  And I still get that wonderful soft and clean feeling after washing my face with it  :)</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Works good.</li>
    <li> Works Great !! Thank you .</li>
    <li> I was initially doubtful but when I received them all doubts went away. They are just as good as the originals. Will buy again which says it all.</li>
    <li> These work great!!! I bought a generic brand before that didn&#x27;t work so I was hesitant to purchase these but took a chance. I like them even better than the name brand ones.</li>
    <li> So happy to find this replacement brush for half the cost! It was a bit of a challenge to figure out how to get the smaller inner brush to stay on - it has to be clicked into place, something my husband was able to fix. Once we got that worked out, it worked just as well as the original and it&#x27;s so much cheaper. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a less expensive replacement brush!  They work perfect...I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the original ones!!!</li>
    <li> Good product!! Will shop again!!!</li>
    <li> Works just fine and certainly affordable.</li>
    <li> I love these replacements...especially the price! Excellent service &amp; product.</li>
    <li> Great product! A super substitute for the Clarisonic brand---what a savings!</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the Clarisonic brand other than the price. I haven&#x27;t had issues with them vibrating differently or not fitting snugly. It just simply works fine.</li>
