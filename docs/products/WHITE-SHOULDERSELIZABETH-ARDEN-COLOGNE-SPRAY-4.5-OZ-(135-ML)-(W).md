<li> My Esposa loves this, been a staple for the past 47 years</li>
<li> I have a small bottle of it.</li>
<li> I just gotta figure out how to get rid of the 2 bottles of crap I bought before I got my education on White Shoulders.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money; you will be disappointed.</li>
<li> br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one</li>
<li> When you do, it&#x27;s off the charts expensive.</li>
<li> This is impossible to find in the stores anymore.</li>

    <li> Love this it is so fresh smelling, very soft. Have wore this scent since I was 16, and that was many years ago..</li>
    <li> A classic feminine fragrance</li>
    <li> This did smell good ,but it only last about 45mins.I would not buy this again,it&#x27;s not worth your money!Go to the store</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly.  My husband loves when I wear this scent, and I wear it very often.  This fragrance was recommended by a close friend.</li>
    <li> I find the scent too strong.  I prefer a much lighter scent.  If you like the smell of gardenia then this perfume spray is for you.</li>
    <li> The only cologne that I have been able to wear for many years is White Shoulders because of my nasal allergies. Since the stores no longer carry it here in my hometown I have been going cologneless, just soap and water.  So I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and for a reasonable price; on other sites the cologne cost more  Thank you Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Frances Maben</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife.  This is a produce my wife has been using for over 10 years.  Shipping &amp; packaging was done in a professional manner.  Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I get so many complements on what I am wearing all the time and the smells stays with you most of the day. Price and size are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve worn a lot of colognes, but nothing suits me like White Shoulders.  For many years I have chosen it as my \\&quot;signature\\&quot; cologne.  However, it is getting harder and harder to find in stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon Online.  The delivery is quick, the price is right, and I can still spray on this beautiful scent that speaks to who I am and gives me and others pleasure every time I wear it.  Thanks for making it possible to find this lovely cologne today.  I still get many compliments when I wear White Shoulders, both from men and women.  I love the convenience and reliability of shopping at Amazon.</li>
    <li> I very much like the White Shoulders scent.  It has a light scent that is not overpowering and lasts for quite awhile. I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is like visiting an old friend...White Shoulders was the very first perfume I ever wore. Still smells wonderful. The spray arrived before the expected date in good condition. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> My dad bought me White Shoulders for my Sweet 16. I have a small bottle of it. It smells wonderful. Not too strong and not too faint if you understand what I mean. The size I have has lasted me for almost 4 years. Just use a little, not too much.</li>
    <li> This is an old fashioned scent that is still lovely.  I am frequently asked what perfume I am wearing.  Light enough for daily use.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the White Shoulders product your mother/grandmother used. The original White Shoulders that I wore in my younger days was made by Evyan, and it was beautiful and long-lasting. Evyan went out of business in the 80&#x27;s I believe, and the name White Shoulders was bought by Elizabeth Arden (EA Fragrances) and Perfumes Intl. They have substituted cheap ingredients and turned it into a cheap drugstore product. Acrid, harsh, with no staying power. Don&#x27;t waste your money; you will be disappointed. Learn from my experience. I researched and found that the TRUE White Shoulders came in cologne, parfum, body lotion (not a cream), Satinglide, and bath drops. There is also powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy unless you see the cursive Evyan signature, a cursive &#x27;E&#x27;, or the trademark phrase &#x27;The Best the World Has to Offer&#x27;. You can find the real thing on Ebay for about $10/oz for cologne, which is not too bad considering I found a 2.25 oz  in original box w/cellophane with a $15 price sticker. Be sure it&#x27;s not just the top that has the Evyan tradematk; make sure it&#x27;s on the bottle too. There&#x27;s even a market for empties, which I used to just stick in my dresser drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just gotta figure out how to get rid of the 2 bottles of crap I bought before I got my education on White Shoulders. Looks like the Goodwill box for them!</li>
    <li> My wife chose this rating; White Shoulders has been her favorite for many, many years and the price was right.</li>
    <li> White Shoulders is was worn by my favorite Grandmother and is now worn by my Mother.  It has become difficult to find in our area and I was pleased to find it online.</li>

Thank you Amazon!!</li>

    <li> I NEEDED TO FIND THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN ANY STORE WHERE I LIVE IN ARIZONA.  I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS AND NEEDED TO FIND OUT WHERE I COULD IT IN QUANTITY.  I WILL BE PLACING ANOTHER ORDER IN A VERY SHORT TIME SO I CAN GET HAVE THEM&lt;br /&gt;AVAILABLE WHENEVER I NEED IT.</li>
