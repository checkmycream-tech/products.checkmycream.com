<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My Go to Lashes. Took some practice but figured it out! Love Red Cherry Lashes, they&#x27;re so easy to put on/take off, used with DUO glue.</li>
    <li> These lashes are so perfect to wear everyday or out! I will be wearing these all the time. Love them!!</li>
    <li> Longer than I expected, but seem to be pretty good quality.  Haven&#x27;t worn them out yet, but I wore them around the house just to see how they&#x27;d feel, and they were comfortable enough that I forgot I was wearing them.</li>
    <li> Great lashes! Very natural and don&#x27;t feel like you even have them on.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a day wear. Not heavy on the eyes. I recommend it. 217 is my go-to lashes. Its my second time buying this set and I&#x27;m doubling the quantity. Ps: i wear falsies 3-4 times a week.</li>
    <li> These are very soft abs natural looking, if you wasn&#x27;t it to look more like fake eyelashes get a different model. Really comfortable to wear(i wear them +17024947664 everyday), also perfect if you have western eyes (big rounder eyes) I used to buy big packs of the ones from China and they&#x27;re just too straight so you have to cut then or pinch them to follow the shape of western eyes. They also last a really long time I definitely reuse each one several times.</li>
    <li> These lashes are so addictive. I feel naked without them. They can be dressed up or down. I love how natural they look and feel. They flutter in the wind like real lashes. They can be worn several times before discarding. I love that you don&#x27;t need a lot of glue and they will last all day. I&#x27;ve tried different human hair lashes but these are the best.</li>
    <li> My wife loved them. Nice quality product</li>
    <li> Great product , so light and easy to wear love them. Shipped fast . Thank you</li>
    <li> They are so natural looking! I love them! And very easy to apply! Red Cherry lashes are my favorite now! I use them on my clients and myself!</li>
    <li> I know they are fake lashes, but they are way to long, will not buy it again</li>
    <li> I am asian with the typical short, straight asian lashes.  I wanted false lashes that would give my lashes a boost but these were way too much.  They were way too long and obvious on my eyes that it looked ridiculous.  I don&#x27;t think these lashes suit asians very well.</li>
    <li> Great value......were in excellent condition! Lash band was thin enough so it can be doubled up for xtra thickness. Out of six pairs, all were perfect.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful eyelashes! I have been wearing falsies for over 2 years, faithfully. These are very soft, and easy to apply. The lash length is perfect, and with a little make up can be dressed up (dramatic) or worn naturally. The price is an amazing bonus, speaking how I&#x27;ve paid a lot more $$ for for less/poor quality! I am able to remove them easily/clean them and re-apply for weeks of use! A pack of 6 will last 1/2 a year with proper care! Love these!!</li>
    <li> I am actually returning this product. I personally didn&#x27;t like the quality of the lashes and they don&#x27;t look natural when I tried on a pair. T he item did arrive in a timely manner</li>
    <li> Nice lashes by Red Cherry (the BEST!) for a longer and a LITTLE more dramatic effect (not overboard).</li>
    <li> best lashes ever if you want to see how they look check me out on youtube i have tutorials using them i am in love search me under migdalia ponce!</li>
    <li> I love redcherry lashes you can over use them as much as you want as long as u take care of them when you remove the lashes always remove the glu thats on it so its better to use next time</li>
    <li> These lashes are the best brand I have ever ever used. I am obsessed to the point I went to the NY makeup show and stocked up on them when I got there. I highly recommend these lashes. They are natural and so incredibly light then when your wearing them you dont even notice. The lash line is not the hard plastic and much easier to put on. Fantastic lashes.</li>
    <li> Love these makes my eyes look bomb</li>
    <li> Eyelashes appear quite natural. Haven&#x27;t used them yet but had a problem with delivery which was resolved immediately! If lashes are as good as the the company behind them, I should have rated them a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Long. Very pretty, very nice quality, but go all the way up to the brows. I trim them but nice if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Great Lashes, love them, they look real.Can&#x27;t tell that you have them on when wearing them all day. Always get compliments.</li>
    <li> i like these because they are very natural looking and great to wear for everyday use if you dont like more dramatic ones</li>
    <li> Great! I loved the quality and the way these lashes are made. Will purchase again...maybe the #43s next time around</li>
    <li> I love red cherry lashes!! These are so natural looking for everyday wear not too long or too short!! I apply these with duo adhesive glue! They are reusable as well!!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re are great quality and arrived on time</li>
    <li> These Are The Best Ever !!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Buying More Right Now lol</li>
    <li> I recieve them friday really good !</li>
    <li> as soon as I received this lashes I new they were gonna be my fav. and threy were I will definatly be being more</li>
    <li> I like the look of these lashes. They are long, but I got over it once I saw how beautiful they looked on a friend of mine. The length looked great and they were not gaudy like I thought they would be. Definitely enhanced her eyes and she was wearing nothing but liber and lashes and went straight to glam just with the lashes.</li>
    <li> The eye lashes were all bent and messed up when I got them in mail and it took forever to get them. WAste of money. All of the lashes were messed up</li>
    <li> These arrived lightening fast and they are so whispy and natural looking. I am so glad I got a six pack and will be definitely buying more of this style!</li>
    <li> My favorite lashes! Not too dramatic but perfect full look that looks natural</li>
    <li> Most natural lashes ever! Always get compliments on them</li>
    <li> Love these. Not too dramatic but still gives you the look of drama</li>
    <li> If you like a very dramatic lash then these babies are for you!  I only wear them in their full glory for evening events where I know there will be a lot of picture-taking as these really make your eyes stand out from a distance.  But for my day-to-night use I always trim them down quite a bit.  Sometimes I cut them in half and other times I cut them into small groupings to fill in just the outer corner of my eyes.  These lashes last longer than other false lashes I&#x27;ve had in the past as they stand up to regular cleaning and look brand new.  Plus, you just cannot beat the incredible price!</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing amazing</li>
    <li> These are natural looking lashes and easy to apply. I am just learning how to use fake eyelashes and these are the easiest to apply of several brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> I love these! The look so natural and in my opinion are the perfect length. They are lightweight and when applied right you can&#x27;t even feel them on. The price is great as well. I&#x27;ve purchased these at retail stores for $2.50 each. I&#x27;m happy, and recommend them. Will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here,,&lt;br /&gt;Yes they are REAL red cherry lashes, the same brand you can buy for twice the price in stores. As long as you pick the correct number/style your getting exactly what you want. So why not pay half price for red cherry lashes and just wait a few days for your lashes to come in the mail.. Will buy again</li>
    <li> not as dramatic as I wanted.  they are nice but I wanted thicker, fuller and more dramatic.  Great if you are looking for a natural look.  Great value</li>
    <li> I love the red cherry lashes</li>
    <li> I love the lashes. They look natural and glamorous.</li>
    <li> Everyone if u are reading this u gotta try these eyelashes they are just great! I love how they look so natural, and if u take good care of them they can last u for weeks..I ordered mine a month ago and i haven&#x27;t even opened the second pack im still in my first one that&#x27;s how great they are:) plus shipping is great i got them in less than a week( that&#x27;s a big plus) ladies u gotta try them, i highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I have several pairs of Red Cherry lashes and theyre all great. The #43&#x27;s are my favorite.  This review is of the 217&#x27;s. They are a little longer than I thought they&#x27;d be, but look &amp; work just as wonderfully as all the others. I highly recommend RC lashes. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that there&#x27;s no good way to know exactly how long the lashes are before you buy them.</li>
    <li> lobe red cherry lashes</li>
    <li> I needed some lashes to accentuate my eyes, I already have long lashes but this ones were just unnaturally too long for me and they looked too fake. Instead, I went with Andrea Strip lashes 21, and they looked great!!! The quality of this lashes seemed ok, unfortunately they are not for me.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic.  Look amazing on.  Little long for my eyes, so I snipped the edge and they are perfect!  I am obsessed.</li>
    <li> I live this eye lashes they are so beautiful and price was perfect I will be ordering more of this soon</li>
    <li> Everything is wonderful</li>
    <li> Always use these GREAT</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;They are the best for my clients and for myself...&lt;br /&gt;Very beautiful great quality and great price...</li>
    <li> these are great eyelashes i trim mine down a tad they are perfect i love them. not gaudy very long length.</li>
    <li> nice but a little long</li>
    <li> Loved the lashes! Thank you!</li>
    <li> really just best ive used and as a dancer and model ive went through somme lashes they were not much more expensive than drugstore lashes and the difference in quality is what trumps all these are from HEAVEN and will make you look like a doe eyed ANGEL</li>
    <li> Love these so much better than ardell lashes perfect for a cat eye look</li>
    <li> I love these.  They&#x27;re a tiny bit long for everyday wear, however for my trip to Vegas they were perfect!</li>
    <li> Those are very good lashes, I love them! very well made, give a great impact but don&#x27;t look fake.</li>
    <li> Way too long to look natural but really flirty and great for a special night outs.</li>
    <li> They are long but not too long and have the perfect thickness. Red Cherry lashes are my all time favorite and I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be buying another brand for a long time. I reuse one pair dozens of times all i do is take off the glue from my previous uses and it;s good as new.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I put 2 of the lashes together for a more dramatic look and it makes my eyes pop. I also wear one set for a more everyday natural look. I get lots of compliments at work! I love these lashes &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Excellent,Thanks soo much, I recommend customers to buy them.</li>
    <li> Nice lashes for the price.</li>
    <li> These Red Cherry eyelashes Look And feel natural. I added mascara to them for more of a dramatic look. I will be buying more soon! Thanks</li>
    <li> Amazing! I love all the lashes, WSP are a favorite. The lashes to me are professional quality.</li>
    <li> The lashes were longer than I what I expected, but that is a very personalized taste. But the quality and shipping was great.</li>
    <li> Love love love! I didnt receive it the first time I ordered it. Wouldnt be surprised if concierge stole my package smh. But when I reached out to let them know I didn&#x27;t get my package they promptly sent out the product again which I did receive. Super satisfied with the product they look gorgeous after applying. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Do you wear them with mascara?</li>
