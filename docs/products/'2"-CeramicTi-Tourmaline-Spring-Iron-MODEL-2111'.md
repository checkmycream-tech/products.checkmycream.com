<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best curling iron I own. It makes the most beautiful curls and they stay all day. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was replacing what had been a great ceramic curling iron (Chi), until its spring broke after just two or three years.  Foreseeing having to purchase a new curling iron every two or three years, I decided to go for a less expensive iron this time around and purchased this 2\\&quot; Hot Tools iron since the reviews seemed promising.  The one I received SUCKED.  It did not do anything it was supposed to do.  The biggest issue I had with it was the gap between the rod and the clamp when the clamp was down.  It was substantial enough that the clamp would not hold onto my hair.  AT ALL.  And in not being able to grip my hair, the heat was not making the necessary contact with my hair to style it, which yielded frizzy results.  I ended up returning this and purchasing the Conair Infinite 1.5\\&quot; curling iron.  I had the same problem with that one, though it&#x27;s clamp was a little better.  I returned that one as well and got another Chi, which is working out wonderfully for me.</li>
    <li> I really value the 2 inch barrel - nothing else will smooth my long, unruly, somewhat curly hair into a smooth soft shape.  And it gets nice and hot with varied settings available.    The only drawback is that the on light is so small that I forget to shut it off.  It needs a bigger light or even better, automatic shut off.  This is a big problem for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron and I love it. My hair is thick and almost to my waist. The curls give my hair so much volume and body I love it. It doesn&#x27;t get hot enought to completely straighten out the top of my hair.  My hair is naturally wavy/curly. But I love it when I use a flat iron and curl the ends with this curling iron. Its a great buy.</li>
    <li> This thing is a joke. It heats up very fast and hot but doesn&#x27;t curl my hair at all. I tried holding for more than a minute but nothing happen. I have thin hair, I don&#x27;t understand why this one doesn&#x27;t work. My old Conair infinite 1 inch works much much better comparing to this Hot Tool. I got the curls in less than 20 seconds. The only reason I purchased this one is because I wanted bigger curls. After reading a lot of reviews about Hot Tools, I was confident to give it a try on this 2 inch tool but turned out very disappointing. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> I needed a jumbo curling iron and checked out a beauty store locally, it was a high price so I decided to check on Amazon and found it at half the price it was at the store.  It was the same brand and exact same iron.  I obviously went with Amazon!! I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I received it!  I really like Hot Tools products and Amazon!!! I recommend these to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Okay well my mom bought me this curling iron and it came a day before Christmas, which was cool because I thought \\&quot;sweet i can curl my hair for christmas!\\&quot; I have thickish hair, about 4 inches past my shoulders more or less, and its naturally wavy and sort of gets frizzy after a shower. I figured I could use this curling iron to shape up my waves after a shower so they look polished and sleek. Well unfortunately this was absolutely NOT what I was expecting. When I tried curling my hair I had to turn it up waaay high because anything lower than about 360 just made my hair straight with a rlly ugly flip at the end. So i realized i had to hold this thing to my head for at least a minute if not more to get a curl. And another thing - the curl doesn&#x27;t look good! It gets a crimp mark where the curl begins on your head, and its shapen all wrong and tight-looking.  Not to mention it gets real boring sitting there holding this monster 5 pound piece of metal-ceramic whatever waiting for a curl that burns the side of your neck and looks like some uptight rope attatched to your head. This thing can barely even straighten right, which is pretty sad. I dont know if the other reviewers just got lucky with theirs or I just got the malfunctioned one but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this curling iron to my worst enemy. I&#x27;ve tried using this multiple times and even my friends have tried but it is not working, it didn&#x27;t work for them either. Except my one friend who got her bangs to look real nice with it, I&#x27;m very disappointed with the outcome.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I had just cut my bangs and they were long enough to give a slight large curl and with a smaller curling iron they would have been too curled, so this curling iron was big enough to give me the look I was striving for.  It also works great as a straightener.</li>
    <li> Great for making large, loose curls. Hard to find an iron of this barrel size in store. Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Hot Tools curling irons in the past and trust the brand.  Gets hot very quickly and this size barrel is great for large bouncy curls.  I also use it to straighten my hair and give the ends a nice rounded look.</li>
    <li> i dont like this product, the conditions were ok, but the product dosent work i could not curl my hair with it...</li>
    <li> My hair is long and very thick its about time i found something that will do something with my hair.Thanks</li>
    <li> Not for me. Very heavy and awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;Gave my hair a weird burnt plastic smell. The curl never took and ended up just leaving strange dents in my hair. I hope to return this one :-(</li>
    <li> This product is a 1-star product for me personally, but for someone with a different type of hair it could potentially be good.  It heats up quickly and the quality seems high.  I have long, thick hair.  I love the big soft curls that this makes, but if I actually wanted to style my entire head with this thing it would take 2 hours.  Just getting a 1-inch section takes 5-10 minutes and a buttload of hairspray and even then, it just falls out in an hour.  Still in that hour my hair looks awesome and the size of the barrel is just perfect for creating those glamorous bouncy locks.  I will hardly ever use this thing and if I hadn&#x27;t already made multiple attempts for over an hour trying to get it to work in my hair I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Read the instructions about tightening the spring if you think it&#x27;s loose.  I have fine hair and it does just fine!</li>
    <li> OMG~~ Finally i can find this size curling iron. I have long hair and sometimes i just want my hair be wavy not curly. this one can do a perfect job, easy to use.love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the bio-ionic sidewinder at the same time.  Both are supposedly equally hot but this doesn&#x27;t make a curl worth a darn and I feel like I&#x27;m standing there forever.  The sidewinder beats it hands-down.</li>
    <li> cont remember this item</li>
    <li> This curling iron doesn not curl if your hair is already straight. It merely irons the hair.It is good for the ends only because it rounds the end. That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I found the ceramic heavy and the 2&amp;#34; awkward  to use. If I could return it I would get the 1 1/2  inch  in medal.</li>
    <li> Received the exact product shown. Works great! I was looking for a large barrel curling iron that had high heat settings for my think Asian hair! :)</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! I bought it because I have the 1-inch and I love how it treats my hair. I use this 2-inch to create loose waves. I love that I don&#x27;t have to put anything in my hair (besides heat protectant spray). My hair is left soft, silky, and the waves hold. I live that the handle is smaller than the barrel. I&#x27;ve used 2-inch curling irons in the past where the handle and barrel are the same size -not comfortable! I like that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto shut-off button because it doesn&#x27;t turn off on you and lose heat while you&#x27;re doing your hair. Overall, this is a great curling iron. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have 3- sizes of the Hot Tools Irons and love everyone of them. They heat fast and evenly and last for years (so far).</li>
    <li> Using this curler is is quicker and easier than any blow dry I have ever had. Love it. Would def recommend for gils with fine mid length hair who need a lift and bounce that stays.</li>
    <li> The product works well, but I wish I had not ordered the 2 inch barrel, rather I would have liked the 1.5 inch barrel. It&#x27;s just too big.</li>
    <li> This is my second Hot Tools- 2 inch curling iron and although it is good, it is not as good as the prior one.  The pros are it heats fast, and has the large barrel which is hard to find.  The cons are the cord gets tangled quite a bit more than the earlier model and I find that this one tends to produce static in my hair.  I have used this one for 1 month now and the static is getting somewhat better so hopefully after some time that will cease to be an issue.  Overall it is a great buy -- good quality and good pricing.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a large iron.</li>
    <li> I hav eno complaints Ive had this curling iron for almost a year or so and use it monthly. The only thing is that when I press down on the clasp, it squeeks so Maybe some Wd40 will help. Heats up fast and my hair does no have the burnt smell. Swivel cord is great.</li>
    <li> this product arrived packaged well, works great too!! comes with extra springs which is something new for me because all my others have broken, i have a lot of hair, thick and coarse too....</li>
    <li> I love the hot tools 2111 Ceramic curling iron I got!! It really makes those big natural curls just like I wanted. It works really well with LONG hair, it gives a celeb look.</li>
    <li> It lasted for 6 months and it just doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughters.  The iron heated up but did not curl either of my daughters hair.  I tried to reach the company via email, they do not have a phone number, in order to return the item.  I never heard back from them.  I am going to dispute it through my credit card.</li>
    <li> I have fine, medium length hair and I love the way this curling iron gives me a salon blown out look. Now, it takes me a LOT less time to style my hair. I bought this brand because I already had the 1 inch and love it as well. I think the key is not only the 2 inch barrel, but also it heats up like a more expensive curling iron. GREAT buy!</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron!  It smooths my kinky hair out and gives it a soft curl that lasts the whole day.</li>
    <li> The Ceramic Curling Iron was of poor quality despite being a hot tools.  I&#x27;ve trusted hot tools in the past but this product was a great disappointment.  Didn&#x27;t hold a curl hardly even a wave.  Pass.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS THING! I have pretty long hair and i curl from the root down. gives me a nice wave and lots of body!</li>
    <li> This iron is for long hair, it makes big curls,the purple color is so nice and works wonderful. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was not a good purchase. The product doesn&#x27;t get hot enought. That&#x27;s not the only problem, it doesn&#x27;t curl your hair like it supposed to. I ended up buying another iron in TjMax, that is a lot more cheaper and works a lot much better.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Great!</li>
    <li> This iron works well to smooth hair and give lots of body.  For a large iron, it&#x27;s easy to use because it&#x27;s designed so well.  I have another large barrel curling iron by Revlon and it&#x27;s so awkward to use.  The power switch and heat dial are where you hand goes, so I&#x27;m constantly either turning it off or up while using it. Someone w/ a brain designed this product since it&#x27;s not awkward at all.  Very good quality as well.  will smooth out hair like a flat iron w/out leaving hair flat.  It&#x27;s perfect :)</li>
    <li> I really like this hot iron. I have used Hot Tools in the past. I feel that the coating is not as durable as previous irons I&#x27;ve purchased. I recommend not just tossing this to store by banging it up against any other surfaces so that it doesn&#x27;t get scratched. It worked great and I&#x27;m very pleased with this iron.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very happy with the heating intensity and the fact that is ceramic. So far, excellent. I&#x27;m also glad I purchased at Amazon.com as elsewhere is more expensive.</li>
    <li> Purple coating is flaking off after just a few months of use. Have to pick it out of your hair or not use iron at all. Loved it at first then disappointed in the flaking.</li>
    <li> I had no idea they made curling irons in the two inch diameter. I was browsing for a replacement for my old 1.5\\&quot; and saw this and took a chance and I really like it. I have hair that falls just past my shoulders and the 1.5\\&quot; rod was okay but I couldn&#x27;t get that big full type curl. This iron does the trick. It takes a little getting used to the size and weight but once I did I was very pleased with the results. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is just past my shoulders in long layers and a 2\\&quot; barrel is what I prefer for flipping out the ends, or curling them under when I want a different look.  Previously I had the gold 2\\&quot; barrel (also from Hot Tools) but I went through all the replacement springs and it was still not clamping down on my hair enough and squeaking terribly. When I decided to order a new curling iron, I would have preferred to get a different brand, but the 2\\&quot; barrels are really hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple curling iron does get hot enough for my hair, although it is on almost the highest setting. Unfortunately after a week of use the spring started squeaking just like the one on the gold curling iron did.  So far it still clamps down on my hair enough, but I have only been using it for about a month.  It does come with 2 replacement springs, but I don&#x27;t feel it is right to sell a product where you have to replace parts right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purple coating has also started to rub off in one area where my hair glides through. I hope it doesn&#x27;t start burning my hair, but if it does I would definitely return it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron for 1/2 the price it is going for at the local beauty supply.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> so far, it&#x27;s been really good. It is a little too hot on the higher setings- But it was really good it&#x27;s like a straighter that will curl your hair a little at the bottom- it doesn&#x27;t really curl - but what i wanted was what i got!</li>
    <li> this seemed to be a nice curler, well made but did not curl my wifes hair, maybe this one was a defective unit. this was returned (amazon has a great return policy and shipping service).</li>
    <li> Tired this on my hair and it does not curl well. Heats up good, must be my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love that it heated up but I guess my hair isn&#x27;t long enough to get a big curl out of it!! My hair falls half way down my back!!!</li>
    <li> Did not heat high enough to curl hair. I ordered as a present and received much grief. Avoid at all costs!!!!!</li>
    <li> Definitively not wort it it doesn&#x27;t curl at all and does heat up fast enough i just tried it twice but it was a total fail</li>
    <li> Within the first month of use, the paint started chipping off leaving pieces in my hair. I&#x27;ve never bought this brand before and probably will not ever in the future. Dissapointed in the hassle of trying to return, but luckily I have Amazon Prime wich eliminates some of the hassles. Now to shop for a better product!</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for this 2&amp;#34; curling iron.  I have wavy, thick, layered shoulder length hair and I curl it up on the ends.  I prefer to have a very soft subtle flip, more of a turning up and outward.  This tool does it beautifully!!!</li>
    <li> Just a friendly warning.  I purchased this less than two months ago.  (outside of the return window by 2 days)  I have never had it even near the hottest setting and have never left it on for more than a half hour.  The purple paint on the clip all bubbled up and now drops chips of purple paint the size of coarse ground pepper all into your hair and all over your clothes.  It is useless and I guess I will just throw it out.  Please take my advice, I have never written a review before but feel compelled to let people know about this.</li>
    <li> I love it. Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron with wide barrel.  Hair is not curled like ringlets but has a curve.  Put it on the lowest heat setting because higher settings always burn me ... very &amp;#34;hot tool&amp;#34; LOL</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft  , no frizz</li>
    <li> I have. med length hair and I could not use it due to the barrell was too large so I gave it too my friend</li>
    <li> This iron is super easy to hold because the handle is small in diameter, but the curling iron barrel is every bit the 2\\&quot; advertized.  My hair is nearly waist-length, and I have looked everywhere for a curling iron like this and am very glad to have found it!  Although there are numerous heat selections, I always have it set on the lowest for my fine hair, and even that is enough to produce the gentle body that I am after.</li>
    <li> It shouldn&#x27;t be called a curling iron because it&#x27;s too big. There&#x27;s really no need to purchase this because it does not curl your hair at all- I ended up returning it. Waste of money</li>
    <li> First iron came broken second one doesn&#x27;t heat up as fast as others I&#x27;ve bought. Disappointed. Will not repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I probably own 15 different curling irons and flat irons and of course I only actually use 2 or 3 of them regularly.  This one (2 inch version) is in the rotation.  Keep in mind that you won&#x27;t get the \\&quot;Victoria&#x27;s Secret\\&quot; wave/curl by using this iron.  What you get is voluminous, STRAIGHT hair that curls at the end - similar to using a large round brush and hair dryer.  I have long, layered hair (past mid-back).  Its great for mornings when I have washed my hair the night before and just went to bed with wet hair.  In the morning its usually a half-straight, half-wavy, big ole mess on top of my head.  So I simply break out my 2 inch curling iron and it does the straightening and \\&quot;flipping\\&quot; for me.  I basically curl the sides away from my face, curl the top/crown back and down and the underneath sections in any direction and it looks pretty good by the time I am done - takes about 10 minutes.  Its been a huge time saver for me!</li>
    <li> My wife has this unit for a while now and loves it.  The clamp works well and heats quickly and evenly</li>
    <li> What a great product. Just what I order and I like this brand of product from Hot Tools. I have several items from them</li>
    <li> This iron does not curl at all. 35.00$ wasted. It does not heat up enough to put a curl in my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is now just below chin length and I cannot use the curler without it having more of a straightener effect. I believe once my hair grows out past shoulder length, it will have a different effect.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this Iron, easy to use and i love the results in just a short time.</li>
    <li> Within months, the purple coating/paint start flaking off.  I can&#x27;t use it anymore, I can&#x27;t be walking around with purple flakes falling out of my hair.  Yuck.  Disappointed.  You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d use a paint/coating that could withstand the heat?!?</li>
    <li> Awesome iron!  My hair is fine &amp; just past shoulder length... I set the temp to 1/2 to full heat &amp; it curls my hair quickly &amp; smoothly.  Large loose trendy curls/waves.</li>
    <li> The curling iron is fine but the on/off light was broken out of the box.  I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back but wish I had because it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
    <li> This is my third Hot Tools curling iron with the purple ceramic coating.  I also have a 1-1/4 inch and 1-1/2 inch irons that have both lasted me many years and I have been very happy with.  I didn&#x27;t do much research on this one, thinking it would be like the others.  Within a few weeks of using it the purple coating began to flake off in my hair when I was using it.  The problem is all coming from the underside of the clamp. When it first happened I didn&#x27;t know and walked around all day with chunks of purple paint in my hair! Unfortunately, I waited too long to return the defective product and now I am stuck with it.  I like Hot Tools products, but won&#x27;t purchase anything with the protective coating again.  Sadly, this was a wasted $40.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. I have had it now for four years. It is amazing and works with long and short hair.</li>
    <li> I have this iron in the 1&amp;#34; diameter and I love it.  It curls my hair very quickly and the curl holds well.  In fact, it makes my hair so curly that I decided to buy a larger, 2&amp;#34; barrel to create a more wavy effect.  I was very excited to receive it but this thing just does not curl my hair.  I don&#x27;t think it really gets that hot because I have to hold it in my hair for quite a long time - longer than I&#x27;m comfortable with actually - the hair barely curls and what curl there is falls right out.  I was so sure I&#x27;d love the 2&amp;#34; iron that I foolishly threw away the packaging and can&#x27;t return it - money down the drain.  For reference, my hair is to my mid-back, color treated, fine but thick, and I usually have no trouble getting it to take and hold a curl.</li>
    <li> Perfect, fantastic while it lasted.  The purple coating flaked off and it rusted, so I had to throw it away.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t turn itself off.  I came home from work on more than one occasion and found I had forgotten to unplug.  If you&#x27;re like me, you might need to look for one that has auto shut off!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my best friend recommended it since it gave her hair great volume.  It took a few tries and some youtube videos to figure out how best to utilize this curling iron.  First and foremost, if you&#x27;re looking for great big cascading fall down curls, get that notion out of your head.  I have fine, thin hair but I have a lot of it.  I use this as a volumizer rather than a curling to &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; iron.  I start from the end tip of my hair turn the curling iron parallel to the floor then slowly curl up to the root of my hair.  Its basically like curling your hair from the bottom to the top as if putting in a hot roller.  For me, thats the best method to use this iron.  And I get the most beautiful bouncy voluminous hair because of it.  This iron does minimal damage to your hair, it doesn&#x27;t snag, stays hot at the temperature you set it on, and its got a swivel cord bottom so it will rotate as you rotate the curler around your head.  If you&#x27;re looking for nice natural curls, buy a curling iron with a smaller diameter.  I have the 1 1/4&amp;#34; and I have this and I love them both.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron for long hair to straighten with soft curl. My hair is curly/wavy and this straightens while adding body.</li>
    <li> This is the second curling iron like this that I have bought.  So hard to find one this size. Also hard to find one that stays this hot consistently.  The cord does not get tangled either.  I&#x27;ll keep buying these as long as they are available.</li>
    <li> Just the right size.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This iron says it reaches 400 degrees but I highly doubt it actually get that hot because I have to hold it on my hair for a very long time to get it to curl and even then the curls do not last. This is very unusual since I have naturally curly hair and normally my hair curls very very easily and the curls do not fall out, but with this iron they only last a few hours if that.</li>
    <li> Just as the other reviews stated, the purple paint is sticky. My hair gets stuck rather than gliding smoothly around the iron. Strangely the curling iron added no curls or waves. Just a lot of wasted time and damaged hair.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be more of a straighter than curler. But it&#x27;s great.  Beware it gets hot and huge barrel!</li>
    <li> I wanted a bigger iron to make looser curls and this does just that. You need longer hair, because it needs to wrap fully around the barrel, but if it is long enough it will look great!</li>
    <li> Great curling iron.  Highly recommended by hair stylist.  I probably could have been fine w/ the 1 1/2 inch version as the 2 inch is VERY big to hold for me (otherwise would have given 5 stars), but it does give good results.</li>
    <li> The iron works fantastic.  It makes great waves - no curls, but waves are what I was looking for so I am happy with that.  I am not happy with the stand as it wont hold the iron.  The stand is a bit on the cheap side.</li>
    <li> I love the size of the curls but the barrel pinches my hair every time I use it.  I have long hair and its hard to avoid getting hair near the part you press with your thumb.  I have bought this in the past and didn&#x27;t have this problem so maybe its just a bad one.  I did like that they ship it with an extra hinge so you don&#x27;t toss it when it breaks.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product for my long straight hair.  It doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair or burn it.  Just the right amount of curl and was what I was looking for and couldn&#x27;t find locally.</li>
    <li> This is a good iron, exactly what is says it is. I dont like that it does not shut off automatically and that the on/off switch is very sensative. I keep it plugged in like many other users and when I move other items around it, it is easly switched on.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for big waves or curls this is the iron for you. Works very nicely.</li>
    <li> This item is what i wanted. Arrived on time in good shape and as described. Buy with confidence, it is as expressed.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. It is huge. I have shoulder- length hair and I use this to add body like a blow out. I tend to start with upper portions of hair and curl down rather than curling up from the bottom. It seems to provide the body I need while saving the ends from unnecessary damage. This iron comes with an extra spring, but I have not needed it. I purchased this about a month ago and am VERY HAPPY!!! I would recommend this wonder hair tool. Fast shipping too!!!</li>
    <li> This is the curling iron I have been looking for.  The large roller is perfect for my long hair.  It straightens out the frizz with a perfect loopy curl.  My hair doesn&#x27;t stick to it or slip from it, as many other irons do.  It stays nicely in place until I release it.</li>
    <li> I bought this Curling Iron for my daughter and myself.  We both have thick curly hair.  This iron does a great job of staightening our hair.  It took some time to get used to handling it since its so large but after a couple uses I feel comfortable.  It heats up quickly and stays hot evenly throughout the iron.  Great iron for the price!</li>
    <li> BUY IT!!!! If you want to create volume to your hair and make look super sexy this is the product. It will not create curls, it just gives a super delicate shape to your hair and depends on the way you use it, it can create lots of volume</li>
    <li> Well, I did like this curling iron a lot, but after owning it two years and using it probably once a week the purple paint began peeling off and I would find it in my hair so I had to throw it out.  Two years doesn&#x27;t seem like a long time for a curling iron compared to all the others I&#x27;ve owned in my life.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this curling iron because I have been looking for an iron that doesn&#x27;t produce such a defined curl, but more of a wave instead. I have somewhat dry wavy hair to begin with but it&#x27;s messier than I want it to be, which is why I purchased this iron. Since my hair is wavy to begin with it usually holds curls very well. When I received the package I was so excited and could not wait to use it. However, after I had \\&quot;curled\\&quot; all my hair I found that it was limp and straight and only had a slight wave near the ends. I was very surprised because I have very long hair (it&#x27;s about 10 inches past the top of my shoulders), so I was expecting there to be more wave since I can wrap lots of hair around the iron. I used it a second time, wondering if I was using it improperly, but that definitely wasn&#x27;t it because I used loads of hairspray and there were still no waves.   I was pretty disappointed with this 2 inch curling iron so I have decided to return it and get the 1 1/2 inch Hot Tools curling iron instead.   Hope this helped you guys!</li>
    <li> I bought this curling iron not realizing just how big 2 inches is!  WOW! I really needed an 1 1/2 inch, but I decided to keep this iron anyway.  It works great and the color is very pretty.  Great way to add body and big curls!</li>
    <li> VERY cheaply made and HORRIBLE on your hair.  If you have fine hair, you will burn/damage it.  Paint comes off the barrel.  Good size in theory but too rough on your hair.</li>
    <li> Love the product - this is my 3rd one.  I just wish they lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time blow-drying anymore, blow-drying makes my hair fall out more anyway. This gives you the same blow-dried look in less time. Although I have long hair, it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair much but gives nice big waves. The outer part didn&#x27;t fall out as other reviewers stated, even though it&#x27;s been months. I use it every day. I love it.</li>
    <li> A gift for a friend. She said she loved it..</li>
    <li> This is an okay tool. In comparison to other curling irons I own, It doesn&#x27;t really create the effect I want. In order for it to do anything more than straighten my hair, I have to keep it on my hair way too long. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> For all of you who have heavy hair, curl resistant hair and damaged hair then this may not be the iron for you. The iron is pretty good about not damaging hair. The ceramic flows through my hair easily. But the curls don&#x27;t last for more than an hour (even with about a gallon of hairspray). Although I have to say I have tons of naturally curly hair, color treated and slightly heat damaged. My hair (Even in its best condition) has never really been able to hold a curl, so I can&#x27;t totally blame the iron. And my hair is pretty long, about sixteen inches long, but the barrel is too big to create the sexy, tossed curls I was looking for. If you have really long healthy hair that curls with ease then definitely order this iron!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sistr in law. She loves it!! She says it works great!! I purchased this over a month ago and she hasn&#x27;t had any problems out of it. You can&#x27;t find a curling iron this big anywhere where we live.</li>
    <li> Heavier than I anticipated and the handle is small compared to the curling part.  But, works well.  Gets really hot!!</li>
    <li> I wanted big curls with this and I got them but.... I have to hold it there for a long time. They are really pretty, but I have tried it on all my friends and it only works on my hair apparently. It&#x27;s really heavy!!!! My arms are so sore after. I think it is still a good iron for me and for my hair bihar for others idk. If you want volume then it&#x27;s good. If you want to flip your ends out get it. If you want an arm workout get it hahaha jk. But if you want curls,,,, ii would think it through harder. I like it, I do but I&#x27;m just saying. I just never use it.</li>
    <li> I loved the curling iron... it does exactly what its supposed to. What more could a girl ask for :) I didnt give it a 5 star because after i used it i realized that its crooked... the metal connecting the handle to the barral is crooked</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! It works really well on my hair type, which is course and partly curly, partly wavy and very frizzy. This curling iron smooths out the frizzies like a flat iron does but puts some bend or curl in the ends without making my hair go limp. I love that I can adjust the temperature. I&#x27;m used to my curling irons seeming like they don&#x27;t get hot enough over time, this one was very hot on the highest setting, I had to dial it back quite a bit. I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love it.  It has a lot of heat for thick hair.</li>
    <li> This iron does not heat up well at all, I had it at the highest and to touch it is lukewarm. I dont know if i got a bad one or not but this product was awful!</li>
    <li> For a very long time I looked for a 2 inch barrel curling iron and this fit my expectations. It was a little cumbersom at first but have got use to its size.&lt;br /&gt;Love the heat settings. This iron does get very hot so I use the lowest setting for my fine long hair.</li>
    <li> This works just as I hoped it would.  It&#x27;s a great alternative to a flat iron.  I wanted straight with a bit of body and a slight turn under/out.  Thank you.  This is fabulous!</li>
    <li> The biggest problem with this product is that it&#x27;s unwieldy!  The small stand doesn&#x27;t prevent the barrel from touching the surface that you set it on.  The iron itself is good for shaping and adding lift, but it doesn&#x27;t really curl. The clamp doesn&#x27;t seem to be tight enough so the hair slips through (my hair is normal density).  I do like the adjustable temperature.  In retrospect, I think I would have been happier with a barrel that was slightly smaller.</li>
    <li> Love this thing it works great the temp control is one of the better I&#x27;ve seen and it makes perfect curls it also doesn&#x27;t clip or pull my hair its a very smooth curling process</li>
    <li> I love this... it gives me smooth hair and body!! I have never been able to use a flat iron, well this works great for giving me body and smoothing hair because of the size! I love it and would certainly purchase again. Some complained of it not automatically turning off, but I personally unplug my iron and put away right after use.. For me this is a great purchase, if you are prone to leaving your irons plugged in, not shutting off.. this product is not for you!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product because i loved the color and the curls a 2 inch barrel gives you. I do so many different things with peoples hair and was looking forward to achieving the big natural waves this curler is supposed to give you. I set it to the highest degree and even after keeping my hair wrapped around the barrel for 2 minutes it left my hair straighter than it started out! I don&#x27;t know if i got a defective one but i have heard of other people who have had this problem. LOOK INTO OTHER PRODUCTS BEFORE BUYING THIS ONE, i know i should have.</li>
    <li> Every time I&#x27;ve used this on my hair I get compliments. It makes it look like I&#x27;ve had a professional blow out and I only use this. It takes 15 min for all of my hair to get curled. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have actually ordered two of these in the last 3 years.  They work well for long hair, no goofy, tight curls.&lt;br /&gt;Nice loose curls for long layers.</li>
    <li> This item was defective. The screw where the spring stays was loose and could not be tightened because the hole in which the screw fit was too big. I couldn&#x27;t use the product at all. Now I will need to pay for return shipping to manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is great if you have hair shoulder length or longer.  Leaves your hair with body and fullness but not too curly like the curling irons available in stores.  It is good quiality and the cord does not twist or tangle.  My only complaint is that the leaver that holds your hair could be a little tighter.  I may be able to adjust that since they provided an extra spring for replacement.</li>
    <li> It gets hot really fast and I love that the cord has a swivel so it doesn&#x27;t knot up.  Sometimes it&#x27;s the little things in life!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this curling iron for almost a year now and it&#x27;s definitely my favorite! But please note, this curling iron is for getting VOLUME and a more rounded look.....NOT for making curls. The barrel is too large to make hair wavy. I have very long hair but it&#x27;s so hard to get volume, but this curling iron has done wonders! I also find that my hair looks more healthy and shiny when I use this iron over some of my other ones.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, naturally curly hair and have longed to smooth and sleek all my life!  This product not only removes the frizz but adds just the right amount of turn under curl I like for my shoulder length, problematic, hair.  It even adds SHINE!  Something dull frizzy hair never gets to enjoy!  A+</li>
    <li> My first Hot Tools, iron and I am HOOKED!!! I have always heard great things about them so I decided to see for  myself! It is amazing!!! Hard to believe just a diff brand iron can do such drastic things to your hair!! Def worth the extra penny!</li>
    <li> I have been stylists for 25yrs. Have gone through many of the plan gold 2in bumpers. This surfaces is smooth and durable. Sooooooo. Much nicer with the purple coating!</li>
    <li> I. LoVE. Hot Tools! Everything about it works for me. I used to have the gold 2&amp;#34; barrel and now have this one. I&#x27;m a fan of Hot tools because they LAST! I had my previous curling iron for 8 years and used it nearly everyday on medium-high heat. The only reason I replaced it is because it was thrown and broken - I was angry - that&#x27;s another story. So, I decided to purchase the ceramic iron to protect my hair as much as possible. I am so happy with the purchase and I read about complaints of chipping paint or a sticky barrel but I&#x27;ve not experienced any issues. That being said I use it in clean or 2nd day hair only with minimal product in my hair. Also, I routinely clean the barrel with a warm rag about once a month or so to keep it in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people also complain about the spring but I find it has the perfect firm grip and it comes with 2 replacements. ChaChing! I&#x27;ve also read about others being upset about crimps - it&#x27;s all in your grip and how you hold the curling iron. Not at all a product flaw. I don&#x27;t have problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great buy. I&#x27;m super happy! Love the long cord and large area at the nose of the iron to hold with your free hand if necessary. Leave my hair soft and silky! As long as I get regular (8wk) trims this doesn&#x27;t damage my hair (super long, thick, voluminous, sexi-mexi hair). ;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Tools wins again. Seller delivers a 100% excellent buy at a killer price. SO happy.</li>
    <li> gave it 2 stars only because Amazon has a great return policy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long layered hair and tried this about 5 times and each time it left me with shineless, frizzyish dry looking hair and the waves did not even last. Mine was from quick -e shop not sure if that matters but figured I&#x27;d mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also comparing this to the results I get from the Infiniti YOU CURL Curling Wand by conair the XL one....which I LOVE! I just wanted larger curls/waves....oh well&lt;br /&gt;Also, it Squeaks when you use it...odd</li>
    <li> This curling iron is terrible! It does not feed hair thru properly and damages hair! I wanted to try and return it but I guess I waited too long so am stuck with it.  I have tried to contact the place I bought it but can&#x27;t seem to since I am past the 30 day window.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that falls about 2-3 inches past my shoulders with a little curl to it.  I like to blow it out straight because it does not hold the curls very well.  This curling iron is perfect for me.  I blow dry my hair until it is mostly dry and then I use this curling iron to smooth, straighten, create volume.  My hair looks great.  It comes out either slightly turned under or slightly turned out but not really tightly curled and not stick straight.  It also allows me to spend less time blow drying and give less focus to getting my hair perfectly straight with the hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Love this! Heats up quick and give me the most perfect curl/wave. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This curling iron grabs the hair-is hot enough to curl curly or coarse hair without damaging it-and makes my hair look shiny and healthy.  I can skip blow drying now and let my hair air dry and add a curl-it looks beautiful.  The black tip stays cool so i can get my hair around the barrel.  This product is excellent for long hair!</li>
    <li> This curling iron works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to. It is a large barrel which means you&#x27;re going to get big, soft curls. If your hair isn&#x27;t very long, you&#x27;re not going to get any curl at all. My hair is down to the middle of my back and I don&#x27;t think I would use this with hair much shorter than that. If you have shorter hair, use a 1.5\\&quot; curling iron or learn how to use a 2 inch flat iron to make curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron is comfortable to use and the purple is cute. I definitely recommend it if and only if you have very long hair.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because this product STRAIGHTENS reallyyyyyy well. It looks natural. However, it doesn&#x27;t curl at all.</li>
    <li> Well, my experience with this curler was bad. Honestly, the curler does not heat up enough to curl the hair. My hair are in fact fine and relatively easy to style. I tried the spray and with extreme hold spray by Aussie it was not curling enough. Do not waste your money on this product.I returned the product cost me six dollars for return shipping. Moreover, few day latter I saw the same product offered for half the price I paid. Hey where is the price guarantee?</li>
    <li> For some reason the grip on the hair when curling isn&#x27;t the best. it really doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair. I will be lucky if the curl lasts 15 minutes. Usually my hair can keep a curl for a while but with this curling iron it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> This unit works well to obtain a hotter curling iron setting. The unit is comfortable to usead has a cooling stand built in.</li>
    <li> I bought this in an attempt to get oliva palermo locks.  I have no idea what is wrong with this product or what you are supposed to do with it.  My curls last maybe one minute.  I hate using hair spray but it doesn&#x27;t even matter because by the time I reach for my hair spray the curl is out.  DON&#x27;T GET THIS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually been having this iron for a while.  When I first got it, I really liked it.  It heats up enough to curl my frizzy hair and make it smooth.  BUT...the handle is terrible.  I ended up throwing the iron away Friday afternoon when I tried to use it and my hair actually got stuck to the handle because of the stickiness.  It&#x27;s so sticky that you can&#x27;t even hold it to use it.  My hands were sticky like glue after using it.  It&#x27;s disgusting.  Hot Tools needs to come up with a better solution for the handle.  Disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a 2&amp;#34;. I thought this was a good price.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well. My hair is just over the shoulders. Would work better for longer hair. I did buy the smaller one and it works great!!!</li>
    <li> Did not curl my hair - even holding hair around the iron until my hair was smoking!</li>
    <li> I owned the gold barrel version of this curling iron before it got a short in the cord after owning it for some 3 years (my fault, I was wrapping the cord too tightly when storing it). I opted to upgrade to the tourmaline version since I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s easier on your hair.  I don&#x27;t know that I can really tell a difference in the health of my hair using this one vice the gold barrel, but I do love the purple coating on this one.  There was something about the coating on the gold barrel that grabbed random strands of my hair and would pull them out - the purple coating is somehow smoother and doesn&#x27;t yank on my hair as hard, even though the clip is quite strong.  I use this curling iron to smooth and straighten my hair.  I&#x27;m just not talented or patient enough to blow out my hair with a hair dryer; this curling iron does just as good as any salon blowout with just slightly more bend (and is much faster!).  The barrel is just too large to create curls, so I would not purchase this if you are looking to add wave or curl to your hair.  I knock a star off because it still does not have a automatic shutoff function like my Conair or Revlon appliances.  I forgot to turn the curling iron off one day and discovered 10 hours later after coming home from work that the curling iron was still piping hot.  That scared me and made me forever paranoid when leaving my house until I bought an outlet timer to use with it.  I also knock it for not being dual voltage.  I hate not being able to take it overseas with me when I travel - all of my other cheapo curling irons and straighteners are dual voltage.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Has made such a difference in how I style my hair.  Lobe the instant heat up.</li>
    <li> My daughter had one and I just had to have one of my own.  It works great, heats up quickly and styling my hair takes only a few minutes.  I  love it.</li>
    <li> got it for my sister, and she said she fell in love with it right away ! great buy! thanks.</li>
    <li> This curling iron has such a strong clamp and spring that your hair gets caught in it all the time, It  doesn&#x27;t open all the way down so the hairs closest to the handle don&#x27;t get released. I&#x27;ve tried using smaller sections of hair, but the same thing happens. The clamp part should be a little more tapered close to the handle. I hate it.</li>
    <li> OK - this is really good  Perfect size.  I no longer have to use curlers and this is FAST to heat up and fast to work.</li>
    <li> I would have given five stars except the stand isn&#x27;t very strong so the iron is often touching the counter. That is annoying to manage but otherwise the device works great.</li>
    <li> I had tried a large hair curler at my daughter in law&#x27;s house, and wanted one for myself.  I looked at reviews and found the Hot Tools&lt;br /&gt;brand is well liked.  It it heavier that the regular, small curling irons so you have to be careful and it takes a little time to get use to it.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair so nice and smooth. After I use it on a section of hair, I wind my hair on very large rollers mainly to keep it out of&lt;br /&gt;my way.  Also, when holding the iron next to my face, I will hold a little booklet between it and my skin to avoid getting a burn.  It goes all the way up to 450 degrees.  I had it set on 380 for a long time, and just started turning it down to 300.  I thought it might be drying my hair, but I use it almost every day.  I put a little hair oil on before using it.  It does a great job on longer hair. It&#x27;s too big to turn my bangs so I still use the smaller iron for that.  In summary, it works great but is heavy so you have to be careful and take your time getting used to it.  Keep it away from kids of course !</li>
    <li> Awsome curls and it is so easy to use love it use it all the time im so pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Hot Tools Tourmaline Irons are the only irons that will hold a curl in my hair.  I have gone through several of their tourmaline curling irons and  my curls take shape quickly and hold for at least the whole day and often into the next day.  This 2-inch curler got very hot but my hair literally just fell straight after unclamping it.  I compared the iron to my other hot tools iron which works well and the color of purple on that iron is much deeper with a thinner coating.  I suspect that this iron was not made to standard or is defective.  If your hair takes curls easily then this will probably work for you, if not then look for something else because you will probably be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this tool infrequently.  When I do use it I get aggravated with the stand on the tool.  The stand that supports the tool on the table.  It is so large and I have to move it back each time I use it.  It does a fair job with curing my hair.  I am just so use to the ease of using my Instyler tool.  No comparison.</li>
    <li> I actually really enjoy using this product.  The heat settings are great.  the size is exactly what I need.  My ONLY complaint is that my hair gets pulled by the little screws.  Wish there was a way to cover those or something.  Overall, a great products</li>
    <li> The product was not what I expected.  It did not do what I wanted it to.  The curls do not hold.</li>
    <li> I agree with many other reviewers that this curling iron doesn&#x27;t create scrumptious curls due to its size. However, this creates natural volumes that give your hair softer look. That&#x27;s what I wanted anyways, so I am very happy about it.</li>
    <li> my favorite curling iron ever</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without this! I haven&#x27;t used my trusty 12 year old flat iron once since getting this curling iron! I love it so much! I can use it to get straight, wavy or large curls! Also get great volume when I use it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. It just stopped working. Smoke started coming from the on/off switch and now it won&#x27;t turn on. It seemed to work just fine until then but it would get pretty expensive to have to buy a new one every 2 or 3 months.</li>
    <li> After three months of infrequent use, the purple paint on the barrel began flaking off into my hair. The seller would not let me return or exchange the item even though I still had the box and the receipt. Poor quality and poor customer service.</li>
    <li> Loved this product at first, but then a lot of the paint started chipping off.  I only had this product for less than 2 months. I would not recommend this curling iron to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not impressed, I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times and the finish started flaking off in my hair. The only reason it is getting 2 stars is because of the features.</li>
    <li> After 4 months of use (approx 2 times per week), a big section of the purple paint on the barrel of the iron is just flaking off in big chunks. I never use the iron on the highest heat, and I do not use a lot of styling products, so I have no idea why this has happened. I&#x27;m very unhappy and would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Does not curl at all! I returned it after one use. I wanted a wavy look and it did nothing but flipp the ends of my hair</li>
    <li> i have super long hair and didnt want tight curls. this gives me the kind of wave that i want without looking overdone during the day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling iron based on other reviews however my hair will not hold a curl with this iron, conair actually works a lot better for my hair.</li>
    <li> WARNING...the purple coating will start burning off and onto your hair within just a few uses...I also have thick, coarse hair and this iron does not heat suffiicently enough to curl it. I&#x27;m a hair expert so I&#x27;ve gone through all brands and models...I would go back to using the regular gold one but make sure you use some kind of protectant or your hair will fry.</li>
