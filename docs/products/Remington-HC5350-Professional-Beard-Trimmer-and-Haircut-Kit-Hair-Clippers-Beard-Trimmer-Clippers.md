      <li>Good trimmer .</li>
      <li>Over all a really good unit and saves you a ton of money.</li>
      <li>it works while the charge cord in plugged in, good feature,</li>
      <li>Very pleased with cordless clippers purchased on Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>I bought this clipper head, very pleased.</li>
      <li>The USB feature will come in very handy when traveling abroad, since most of us will have a laptop or PC access.</li>
      <li>Battery charge is good, cuts evenly and is easy to maintain!  </li>
      <li>This device looks great and it has strong blades.</li>
      <li>Really really nice.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my fault in selecting this kind for him</li>
      <li>Before taking a razor to his body, it is nice to have somewhat shorter hair, and this product did well for that.  </li>
      <li>the cage part slides all over and has a mind of it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s a nice feature.  </li>
      <li>It does help you clean the trimmer, but the advice to rinse the blades in water after each use strikes me as not so great.</li>
      <li>I love the easy-to-wash feature of this trimmer, the size is very appropriate for traveling and the usb charging is a plus.</li>
      <li>The tappering tool is attached to the clipper and it worked great, so that was cool.  </li>
      <li>On the bright side, cleaning is really easy, since you can run it under water (the blade area pops up).  </li>
      <li>you can not do it very easily.</li>
      <li>The cuts have been nice and clean and battery life is good, though it lacks the power of a heavy-duty corded unit.    </li>
      <li>, feels comfortable in the hand and, has good power when cordless.  </li>
      <li>I have an old Remington body shaver that I think is the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It is also nice to be able to use one trimmer to trim the beard and cut the hair.  </li>
      <li>showed up on time, its a great christmas gift, perfect for trimming hair, and beard little to no pulling on hair.</li>
      <li>I had used some others better than this and cheaper than this.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this hair and beard trimmer.  </li>
      <li>but I am sure I will get years of use out of it.  </li>
      <li>My wife put something on top of the case.  </li>
      <li>Now when traveling I do not need more chargers.</li>
      <li>i recommend this product and am pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Best of all, it was relatively inexpensive, and still works as of this writing.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
      <li>but I suspect they&#x27;d be more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is what I use it for about once a week, 2 at the most, depending on what is going on with life at the time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I mostly use this for beard and sideburn trimming.</li>
      <li>I also use it on my most precious area with no problem.</li>
      <li>I do think the wall plug provides more power than the cordless.</li>
      <li>I love shaving outdoors.</li>
      <li>It cuts okay</li>
      <li>I love that it is cordless</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve been using this clipper for almost 6 months now (about 10-15 hair cuts and trims) and it has been one of the better ones we&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When attached to the Remington, the Remington felt more unwieldy than either Conair or the Wahl when I tried to use it on myself.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it would work better for thicker hair?  </li>
      <li>but I have gotten better life from a charge than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also love that I can shave while it is charging.</li>
      <li>the width of it is more so</li>
      <li>I use the beard attachment which works OK.</li>
      <li>Just OK.</li>
      <li>but I love Remington and preder to buy their products.</li>
      <li>He did wish it had a smaller tool option, but the adjustable settings are perfect for a variety of uses.</li>
      <li>I love having an electric razor that I can charge and use again and again without wasting batteries.</li>
      <li>I cannot comment on how many charges it will take</li>
      <li>It has the smoothest cut and with the different length blades gives an excellent hair trim.  </li>
      <li>I am very happy with my purchase and I am sure that it will last many trimmings</li>
      <li>You can squeeze 2-3 months of at home cuts and each time your quasi-barber will get just that much better.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am less than thrilled with this product ... it&#x27;s big and clunky and using it on your face almost feels like having each hair ripped out of your face one at a time in slow motion. There is no way to keep a length setting ... the cage part slides all over and has a mind of it&#x27;s own feels like it wasn&#x27;t designed correctly to stay \\&quot;connected\\&quot; to the base.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m going to end up heading in this direction ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005PUZZR8 Remington MB4040 Lithium Ion Powered Men&#x27;s Rechargeable Mustache and Beard Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not even a good paper weight ;-)</li>
    <li> Did not last as long as I would had liked. Good concept for when deployed. Even buying a new one of these a month is still cheaper than paying the rediculus price of a haircut these days.</li>
    <li> Having a household full of young boys, we need a clipper that can handle a workout.  We&#x27;ve been using this clipper for almost 6 months now (about 10-15 hair cuts and trims) and it has been one of the better ones we&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It is quiet and pretty strong (it doesn&#x27;t get bogged down on longer hair).&lt;br /&gt;You can plug it in if the rechargeable battery is losing power.&lt;br /&gt;The weight/design make it easy to grip and use handle.&lt;br /&gt;My kids actually sit well through a cutting when I use this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Hair gets stuck in the guards/attachments quite often.&lt;br /&gt;Even though the blades easily pull out to clean, it isn&#x27;t so easy to clean as hair sticks to a little foam strip inside the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must be said that this clippers is too big for smaller areas; it is for hair cuts, not precise trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product for those who want a quiet, strong, and easy to use hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: EDIT MAY 2012 - We&#x27;ve been using this clipper quite often for almost one year.  It is still going strong and my review stands without correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve reviewed this product as part of the Amazon VINE program.</li>
    <li> This is my first hair trimmer, therefore I cannot really comment on how it compares with other similar products.  I was surprised with the build quality for the price. The blades seem to be made of high quality stainless steel and are very sharp. They claim that the blades are titanium coated self sharpening. You have to be careful when using this without the guards.   One of the best feature of this trimmer is that it is cordless, giving you the freedom to use it anywhere. The battery stays charged pretty long and the indicator tells you how much you have. I cannot comment on how many charges it will take but I am sure I will get years of use out of it.  The USB charging is a bonus, especially for travelling people but I can see myself using it when I cannot find the power adapter.  Not that it matters for the functionality of it, but I was impressed with the quality and the looks when I received it. It looks fancy and expensive. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Nice heavy duty construction and cuts great.  Not cheaply made which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> While my husband wasn&#x27;t over the moon about this product, he did say the trimmer was a solid performer. It works well and does a good job on trimming. We didn&#x27;t use it for hair cutting, just cleaning up what was missed after a cut. The price is very decent and for it you get a good, quality trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality (professional) hair trimmer. It is larger that I have purchased in the past to groom facial hair. You just need to be careful or you remove more than you planned for. This unit would definitly be good for hair cutting ! I am very happy with my purchase and I am sure that it will last many trimmings</li>
    <li> Simply great, very well built, and easy to clean...</li>
    <li> I use electric clippers to clean up between haircuts - sideburns, eyebrows, etc. I would consider this to be light duty for any clippers, and in this role these clippers do a fine job. I have not tried them on larger jobs but I suspect they&#x27;d be more than sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are very lightweight and compact. Remington did a good job of designing these to be convenient for the traveler, even though that&#x27;s probably not their intended use... In spite of the built-in rechargeable battery, these clippers are very light which actually makes them easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with the battery life. Having charged them when I received them, I have not charged them since and the clippers are still going strong. The documentation says they will run for approximately 40 minutes on a charge but I have gotten better life from a charge than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a proper cable the clippers can be charged via USB, though I do not have the right size cable for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the clippers is a snap. With the push of a button the blades pop forward, making cleaning out the blades simple. Using a can of compressed air, getting out any little bits of hair and dandruff is effortless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though not something I use every day, these clippers meet my needs admirably. There&#x27;s no fumbling with an awkward cord when using them, they are lightweight and are easy to adjust and clean.</li>
    <li> Currently, we have an old standard clipper/trimmer/haircut kit from Wahl and a Conair iStubble cordless clipper/trimmer.  These are what I will be comparing the HC5350AM against for this review.  I&#x27;ve had this for approximately one month, and now that my hair has had a chance to grow back and get cut again a few times, I&#x27;m ready to do my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big deal about the Remington is that it&#x27;s rechargeable, including the option to charge via USB.  That&#x27;s the main push in the advertising.  It also has multiple guide attachments, allowing you to adjust the length of cut 15 different ways.  But, I asked myself, is that really enough for me?  While giving it its first 16hr charge, I read over the instructions to familiarize myself with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you&#x27;re down with metric folks, as that&#x27;s how the attachments denote length of cut - in millimeters.  Typically, I know which number attachment to use for the Wahl.  As far as I know, these aren&#x27;t lengths, just a number.  For the Remington, I had to do a bit of conversion, thinking, and some bit of trial an error followed on body parts not typically visible to others.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you just whip the Remington out and start cutting without testing it out yourself.  My wife used it for herself on her \\&quot;usually not visible parts,\\&quot; and it left a rash and cut her skin when she wasn&#x27;t even pushing hard.  Now I know, it isn&#x27;t meant for this kind of usage necessarily, but be forewarned, it can and will cut sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Wahl, I found the guide attachments for the Remington to be subpar.  They both looked, and felt, cheap.  It didn&#x27;t seem to take much pressure to cause them to flex enough to give an uneven cut.  Unlike the Wahl attachments, these were huge.  When attached to the Remington, the Remington felt more unwieldy than either Conair or the Wahl when I tried to use it on myself.  It may have had a cord on it, but the Wahl felt right in the hand and was easy to use, whereas the Remington didn&#x27;t.  I thought perhaps this was because I wasn&#x27;t as familiar with the Remington, but after a month of use, I can say that that is not the case.  On the plus side, the Remington only uses 2 guide attachments total for the various length cuts, while the Wahl requires a new attachment for each length and style.  (The Conair doesn&#x27;t need attachments.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting are is about the same as the Wahl and larger than the Conair, and this lead me to wonder about the USB charging and \\&quot;for guys on the go\\&quot; marketing.  Could I picture myself using this in a hotel room? Likely not.  Would I likely be giving myself a haircut while on a business trip, risking a botched job and leaving me looking stupid?  Certainly not!  For travel, I&#x27;d be wanting something smaller, with fewer parts to lose/forget, for trim work and shaping only, which is where the Conair would come in.  I can&#x27;t say that I find the Remington would meet the needs of someone that travels, someone that&#x27;s \\&quot;on the go.\\&quot;  If I shaved my head regularly, maybe, but a razor would do just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To finish this up, I just wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with the Remington.  The cordless feature, while the best thing I think it has going for it, just isn&#x27;t enough to save the whole package.  The attachments and their use isn&#x27;t up to the same standard as the competition.  The price isn&#x27;t bad, true, and if I didn&#x27;t need the attachments at all, it might be a good buy.  Perhaps for shaving animals at a vet&#x27;s office or dog groomer?  Anyhow, that&#x27;s all folks.ought perhaps this was because I wasn&#x27;t as familiar with the Remington, but after a month of use, I can say that that is not the case.  On the plus side, the Remington only uses 2 guide attachments total for the various length cuts, while the Wahl requires a new attachment for each length and style.

The cordless feature, while the best thing I think it has going for it, just isn&#x27;t enough to save the whole package.  The attachments and their use isn&#x27;t up to the same standard as the competition.  The price isn&#x27;t bad, true, and if I didn&#x27;t need the attachments at all, it might be a good buy.  Perhaps for shaving animals at a vet&#x27;s office or dog groomer?  Anyhow, that&#x27;s all folks.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this to give himself a buzz-style haircut.  He has used it many times and says it is the best one he&#x27;s ever had.  No problems with it in over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 19, 2013 - still working great, hubby still uses it regularly and loves it.</li>
    <li> In agreement with the other 1 star reviewers: I put the trimmer on the lowest setting \\&quot;3\\&quot; and it cut different lengths all over my head and beard.  I had to shave everything down to nothing (using the trimmer without attachments) and grow my hair back.  Since there are so many positive reviews, I thought maybe it was user error and tried again when my hair grew back.  No dice - it was another butcher job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to return it to Amazon, they said my return period expired two days ago and that I would find out if I can get a full refund only AFTER shipping the item back to them.  Not the customer service I&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon: they have always been great to me and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been a customer since 1996.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: THEY DID REFUND ALL MY MONEY.  I thought they were slipping, but nope, Amazon still has great customer service!</li>
    <li> Remington makes excellent shavers, and this one is no exception. I use it both to cut my hair and trim my beard. It works very well at both tasks. It also has an excellent cordless battery, charging quickly and holding a charge for a long time. I have a similar product from Norelco that doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well. I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad and he said it&#x27;s cut great so far. He did wish it had a smaller tool option, but the adjustable settings are perfect for a variety of uses. Good price, too. It was more expensive in several stores I looked at.</li>
    <li> Several years of use and still working great. I use it only for beard trimming.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer when I was stationed overseas for my personal use.Let me say this about  this particular trimmer without any exaggeration that I haven&#x27;t seen such a perfect trimmer. As compare to the other trimmers available in the market, this trimmer is almost half the price but when it comes to its functionality and durable design there is no matching at all. The material used is highly durable and can be used for heavy duty with years to last. The beauty of this trimmer is that you can use  it as corded  or cordless, because the built in rechargeable batteries can work for more than 40 minutes continuously.</li>
    <li> If your hair style lets a barber or stylist to buzz cut you in 10-15 minutes and you have a friend or partner who is willing to spend 30 min cutting your hair once a month a clipper is the way to go. You can squeeze 2-3 months of at home cuts and each time your quasi-barber will get just that much better. Then you can go in for a professional buzz, but by then the cost of the clippers have already been recouped from the cost of the haircut and tip.    We use Wahl clippers for the most part and have been very happy. The Remington set does a find job, but I miss the extended accessories, the additional attachments and the sheer power of the Wahl set.    This Remington set does the job and does it well enough, especially if you have a family of men and boys who like buzz cuts. With a little practice you can go well beyond buzz cuts and just use the clippers for trimming with a comb and add in some scissors.     There is plenty of power in the clipper. You do have to watch the lubrication and cleaning of the clipper, but this is standard for all clippers.     Well worth the cost and you just need to use it 2-3x to break even and after that it is all cost savings.</li>
    <li> The best feature of the Remington clipper is that it is cordless.  I charged it up, when I got it, let it sit for some weeks and it held the charge fine.  My spouse didn&#x27;t care for the clipper attachments. They got clogged with hair and had to be removed often.  Also, we found them a little confusing. As I helped him with the final trimming of his new, very short hair style, I thought I noticed a little striping pattern. It appears there are some advanced features of this clipper that we didn&#x27;t really figure out.  It is a little quieter than our other clipper.  I think that we will be a two clipper family as we like the cordless feature, but we don&#x27;t think this will do everything that we want a clipper to do.</li>
    <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair myself and we have a Wahl set with 5 guard sizes and two different trimmers.  I thought I&#x27;d give this one a shot because it was cordless.  While this unit is definitely quieter when in use and also easier to use in more places due the lack of cord, it is not as effective as the Wahl with giving a haircut.  It took longer and I had to go over the hair several more times.  Maybe it would work better for thicker hair?  I do like the ease of cleaning and maintainance compared with the Wahl.  You just pop the head off and clean it out.  It is also nice to be able to use one trimmer to trim the beard and cut the hair.  The different adjustable settings make it easy to get a precise cut.  It&#x27;s possible that I am just more used to our old clipper and that&#x27;s why I prefer it.  I do think the wall plug provides more power than the cordless.</li>
    <li> well, a few weeks ago, i decided it was time to chop off my near shoulder-length hair. i used scissors to cut off most of the hair, but luckily, i had this nice little haircut kit to do the fine-tuning. for me, it worked flawlessly. the ergonomics are nice and it does exactly what its supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the kit comes with several attachments for cutting to various lengths. its pretty solidly built....doesn&#x27;t seem flimsy like cutters i&#x27;ve gotten from some other brands. sure, its not professional quality, but for the price you get a great deal. i recommend this product and am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I have two children with profound handicaps and trimming their hair si difficult at best. I use an plug in hair trimmer that works pretty good but it would be so much easier if I could use a cordless trimmer so I ordered this one. After charging it I attempted to cut y son&#x27;s hair. His hair is thick and nappy and this trimmer just couldn&#x27;t cut it, literally. It immediately bogged down and fortunately I was able to back it out without it staying caught in his hair. So if you have children with thick nappy hair this is not the trimmer for you. I do not know if it works on the hair of children with other types of hair.</li>
    <li> i like that i can recharge this machine with usb cable, because i live tri continental lifestyle. machine itself works excellent and has been worry free for half a year. five points!</li>
    <li> Adjustable head does not stay put, low setting only.</li>
    <li> Decided to get this rather than the specifically \\&quot;kids\\&quot; one by Phillips Norelco.  My 4-year-old hate the big regular clippers.  When we were done with his first hair cut using this clipper he said, \\&quot;mom, we can keep this one, I like it.\\&quot;  It was quiet.  It cut fast.  And my son didn&#x27;t mind holding still at all.  We got done at a fraction of the normal time.  Since it&#x27;s actually designed for an adult, I don&#x27;t take it that I&#x27;ll have a problem for my husband.    The only thing is that the combs take a bit of figuring out.  The instructions weren&#x27;t clear at all other than what the lengths are.  It doesn&#x27;t even tell you with one is the \\&quot;short\\&quot; comb and which is the \\&quot;tall.\\&quot;  I used my old combs from the heavy old clippers to figure it out.  The measurments are 1 mm off.  For example #3 is 10 mm and the comb here is 9mm.  So not standard, but 1mm isn&#x27;t much.  The tappering tool is attached to the clipper and it worked great, so that was cool.  It was great with a slightly wigglely 4-yr-old and I didn&#x27;t take a chunk off just because he moved a bit.    The video shows the highest model&#x27;s abilities.  This one isn&#x27;t far off, though there isn&#x27;t a time left display.  It has the USB charging abilities, but only can with a regular a/c plug.  Also the packaging is manufacture packaging and not store display packaging.</li>
    <li> My past experience has been limited to two prior Conair trimmer/clippers - one corded, one cordless. The Remington has both my wife and I impressed. The unit is quieter than either Conairs, and sharper than either was when new. I have not tested the duration of charge on the Remington yet, but it cannot be worse than the cordless Conair was - it never held a charge for the three to four weeks between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Remington cam without instructions so we had to puzzle out the use of the combs, which was not too difficult, though we did find that they become &#x27;clogged&#x27; with the trimmed hair and need to be shaken out periodically (not a problem with the Conair&#x27;s combs). I do like the fact that the one adjustable comb replaces the 5-6 that we had with the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we are very pleased with the product and will be using it in preference to our prior set of clippers.</li>
    <li> This is a very well constructed clipper, and I think it hits the sweet spot for value.  As I was reviewing this, I also received a very cool [[ASIN:B004QG88MG Norelco Do It Yourself Hair Clipper - Norelco QC5530]], which has a fundamentally different design.    If I were going to have to pick, I would chose this one, even though it&#x27;s less expensive.  I&#x27;d also pick this over my $12 clipper.   The construction quality is better, and the ability to adjust the comb&#x27;s length instead of switching them is just a killer feature that makes clippers lacking this feature seem terribly inconvenient.  This one is easy to clean (under a sink!) and the charge lasts forever.  I haven&#x27;t charged mine in a month, and use it at least a couple times per week.    In case you can&#x27;t tell in the photo: it&#x27;s a little thinner than traditional clipper.  Since it&#x27;s cordless and convenient to pick up, I&#x27;ve been using it quite often simply to clip my side burns.  Occasionally, it will be Monday morning and my facial hair is a little too long for my shaver, and this item kills that stubble very quickly.  When you add these tasks onto simply cutting hair, you will come to appreciate that it&#x27;s a little thinner.  It&#x27;s easier to use because of that, and I don&#x27;t miss the width when I&#x27;m cutting my hair.    It&#x27;s just a nice solid cordless hair clipper at a pretty reasonable price.</li>
    <li> If you have a handful of youngsters who need haircuts, it can run maybe $100 for a barber run for everyone. So why not start a home- style barber shop, which is exactly what this haircutter/ trimmer does. Plus have lots of fun..Easy to use, easy to store, and guaranteed to get smiles and a few laughs, along with  fine haircut for all. how can you beat it!?</li>
    <li> The kit is well equipped for the basic haircut that you can give to a kid or your roommate. The power is good enough on a fresh charge to get through some of the thickest wiry hair. The kit is probably a bit on the light side for truly professional use, however, it will provide a high quality set for the household.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of clippers, and these are the lightest I have come across.  Additionally, they don&#x27;t make a lot of noise, which is great for skittish kids or animals.  It may follow that they would be too weak, but I haven&#x27;t had an issue with that.  The cuts have been nice and clean and battery life is good, though it lacks the power of a heavy-duty corded unit.    The comb style is a bit strange, but the ability to adjust length is great.  The only problem is that long hair might build up and need to be cleared periodically.  I think they were designed this way for stability, but using stronger plastic instead and keeping the traditional shape might have been a better choice.    On the bright side, cleaning is really easy, since you can run it under water (the blade area pops up).  This feature is not something I&#x27;ve had and it is a great surprise.    For the price, I think this is a good bet.  Even with heavy-duty units, I find it convenient to have a light trimmer like this for jobs that don&#x27;t require more power.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for beard trimming as my current beard trimmer guide was broken. The first day I got this trimmer I opened it, plugged it in to charge, and \\&quot;tried\\&quot; to read through the directions. As others have mentioned the instructions tell you nothing you need to know and might as well be tossed in the trash. While it was charging I decided to test it out. I set it to a high setting to try and gauge what length I would need to use and as soon as I pressed it to my chin, the plastic guide bent so far as to put the blades right to my chin and shave the hairs down to nothing. I immediately plugged in my old trimmer, trimmed it all down evenly and sent this POS back the next day. I advise anyone looking for a good trimmer to avoid this one like the plague.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with cordless clippers purchased on Amazon.com. They are light weight and seem to be sturdy and very reliable so far..</li>
    <li> This device looks great and it has strong blades. It would be fine if you are shaving your head but I must critique the usage of the plastic levelers. They are so fickle and once they snap to the side, they slide up and down so it is way too simple to make a mistake and accidentally cut too dep. Luckily this hasn&#x27;t happened but after a few uses, I found myself using another clipper.</li>
    <li> I took the advice of the raters and reviewers of this and similar products when shopping for my trimmer. This is not a very good product. First off.... the trimmer does not achieve a full charge. Secondly the user instructions are completely inadequate. There is nothing to them and they do not explain how to fully use this product and its attachments. The attachments do no sit well on the razor and slide on their own, back and forth,  this makes for some scary trimming. I am dissatisfied with this purchase and if this product represents this company, I will not be buying a Remington product in the future. This was poorly done.</li>
    <li> This is well built and useful.  Compact and handy for anyone interested in a haircut, trim or both.  Good price considering its workmanship.</li>
    <li> Attachment/ guide  was flimsy.. broke easily.  Attachment had to be removed for cleaning and then replaced on the trimmer head. Settings were hard to manipulate and adjust  each time.  Part broke despite gentle use.  Item is not robust enough.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice clipper/trimmer set. My husband has a very handsome, well groomed beard and generally uses an electric trimmer set to trim his beard with.  He&#x27;s always getting compliments from complete strangers and he loves the attention, especially compliments. He&#x27;s just a big ol&#x27; ham. However, because of his profession, he is always on the go and sometimes doesn&#x27;t get around to grooming when needed.   This was the perfect unit for him to take with him on the go. Fits excellent in his laptop bag which he has with him, almost always.  He loves the USB charging cable. He says that sometimes there is never any power sources where he&#x27;s at and he must always look well groomed when meeting with important clients. He always says, \\&quot;appearance and attitude can make or break a deal\\&quot;.  Overall, my husband likes this clipper set and I like it too.</li>
    <li> It was not new But it works good</li>
    <li> I just got it this weekend.  I found it very confusing and, the pamphlet that comes with it says NOTHING about HOW to use it with the \\&quot;extensions\\&quot; AKA \\&quot;combs\\&quot;.  It gives you all the supposedly different lengths but, not how to get them there.  AND why is there a lock on one \\&quot;comb\\&quot; and not the other?  It said 15 settings? NO! not even close.  Too bad because it looks nice, feels comfortable in the hand and, has good power when cordless.  So, hey, Remington!  Are you reading this?  Put a lock on the second comb, and put detailed instruction..then it would probably get at least 4 stars if not 5!</li>
    <li> Great product so far.  Hope it holds up for years.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Still working excellently well after  over three and a half years</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband who goes to the barbershop every 10 days to get his hair trimmed. For someone who is bald on top, I think it&#x27;s a waste of $$$ so I offered to get these and do it for him. Besides, I always had to clean up the back of his neck with a razor when he got home because they never fixed it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are both very happy with this trimmer. It works great for super short hair trims, even for a novice.  I did a better job on his hair than Supercuts does with their professional clippers. I love that it is cordless so we can do this outside and not have to clean up tiny hairs all over the bathroom.  Cleaning up the trimmer after a hair cut is super easy- just push the buttons on the sides, the blade head slides out and rinse. They recommend changing the blades every 6 months. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet but I&#x27;m assuming it will be pretty easy too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I assume it would be great for beards as well.  Over all a really good unit and saves you a ton of money.</li>
    <li> guard sizes are wrong and it doesnt cut very close without a guard. but other than that it works well.</li>
    <li> I have had the product a month and have used it three times.  After the initial charge, I have not charged it again yet.  Still working on first charge.  Product is easy to use.  It feels sturdy in the hand and is not a lightweight, flimsy product.  The blades flip out and are relatively easy to clean.  It says I can run water over these, but I have been reluctant to do that so far, so cannot comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Still like product.  Quiet and easy to use.  Washes out nicely - no problems.  HOWEVER, plastic blades break easily.  Be careful not to bang the plastic blades or flex them too much.  I stored my trimmer with the blades attached  in a soft plastic zipper case under the sink in the bathroom.  My wife put something on top of the case.  Broke both edge blades off.  New blades are $4 plus $6 for shipping.  Trimmer seems sturdy, but not the plastic blades.  If you&#x27;re very careful with them and store them in a safe spot, they should be ok.</li>
    <li> I did not get this trimmer to cut head-hair but body hair.  For that, it works well.  My husband swims, so he periodically shaves to go faster.  Before taking a razor to his body, it is nice to have somewhat shorter hair, and this product did well for that.  I also needed \\&quot;shorter\\&quot; leg hair before using an epilator, and this trimmer worked well for that, too.  It is quiet and fast, though charging takes 14+ hours (overnight) before it works at full speed...unless you want to keep it plugged in.</li>
    <li> my hubby just started growing a beard and it is great for trimming it</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cordless.&lt;br /&gt;- The comb clip is notched so you can adjust the length that it provides.  One clip to do it all.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean.  It has a switch that pops out the blade for easy rinsing and cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;- USB charging.  I guess it&#x27;s a nice feature.  It seems like this would be more useful on something like an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The first charge seems to take a really long time.  I had it plugged in for almost 24 hours before I got impatient and just started using it.  Worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;- No battery indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good, basic clipper if that&#x27;s all that you need.  I think it&#x27;d be perfect for people who have kids and it might even work on pets.</li>
    <li> Works good charge lasts a log time</li>
    <li> Like many guys who are balding, I prefer to keep it very close cut and usually use a beard trimmer to get the job done.  This trimmer must be targeting people who keep pretty shaggy beards as you can&#x27;t cut the hairs short at all with it</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I have found so far, and believe me that in the last 20-something years I have had my share. That is what I use it for about once a week, 2 at the most, depending on what is going on with life at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no use for the attachments. I also use it on my most precious area with no problem. I just have to take my time and not rush. Any time I have nick myself has been my fault...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scanned thru the reviews and it seems to be an issue with the plastic clips. I cannot comment on that, since I have no use for them. I use it with no guards to shave my entire head or do &amp;#34;military crew cut&amp;#34; when honoring our military on special holidays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been MY experience:&lt;br /&gt;~ Charge holds very well. I prefer to use it cordless. I am not bound to the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;~ I love shaving outdoors. Less cleanup to do. Can enjoy the view and watch the birds while I shave my head...&lt;br /&gt;~ I like the way it feels in my hand. Not too bulky or heavy, but sturdy instead of fragile.&lt;br /&gt;~ Water resistant is a major plus. Can be washed after every use, specially the intimate ones. I like taking it with me into the shower for that.&lt;br /&gt;~ Easy to clean when hair is a bit longer than usual while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;~ Travels well. The USB feature will come in very handy when traveling abroad, since most of us will have a laptop or PC access. One less wall charger to pack.&lt;br /&gt;~ Priced well as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will be getting a second one (a back-up) in case something happens to the one I have. After all, it has been with me at least for a couple of years already, if memory serves me right... I am considering the HC-5550. Will see.</li>
    <li> Not as functional as other remington products.</li>
    <li> This shaver was working just fine, holding charge and working well until this January after 4 months of use, it just died. We charged it according to the instructions and it won&#x27;t turn on. We would like a refund or replacement.</li>
    <li> in Greece wee have 230 volt! you send me transformer for charge the battery 120 volt !!! the Remington HC5350 is off</li>
    <li> Have used it twice a month for last 7 months. It works perfect and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;However, you can keep it on charge for days but the charging light will never go off or change colour to indicate fully charged</li>
    <li> Very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;The added battery is great for when your on the run.&lt;br /&gt;Quite compared to other brands I owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a bunch of these, searching for one that does it all. It may not exist. But I like this Remington HC5350 because it has one hard-to-find feature that I really need: the ability to work when plugged in. Other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned become useless bricks when the battery no longer holds a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: powerful enough motor to run at a consistent speed -- makes obtaining an even trim easier. Ni-Mh batteries, better than Ni-CD and less expensive than Lithium. Fairly easy to clean. Comb attachments do not flex, which also helps achieve even trims. Parts feel less fragile than other models I&#x27;ve used. Overall comb adjustment range is good, but see below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: having one more notch between each of the existing adjustments for beard length would be a big improvement. My preferred beard length is right between two settings. Blade is too wide to trim my mustache at the lip line -- back to scissors for that step. The &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; button is a silly feature. It does help you clean the trimmer, but the advice to rinse the blades in water after each use strikes me as not so great. You then need to oil the blades and be careful not to get water into the trimmer. Push the &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; button and blow or brush out the hair and I bet the trimmer will last a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though my cons list is longer than my pros, I like this trimmer because the cons do not really hinder the operation and as long as I can power it with the cord, it will not end up in the landfill prematurely due to dying Ni-CD batteries.</li>
    <li> This device is built well and large.  I think it is good for those individuals who want to keep a thick beard.  The current adapters are not good for small stubble beards.  I basically have to shave my beard without the guard (bare).  It cuts okay but not as great as the small Wahl devices I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I think its great that I can use it while plugged into the wall.  I couldn&#x27;t even use my old Wahl device when plugged into the wall.  I would have to wait for it to charge with each use.  The battery life on this device is sufficient too and its also easy to clean the device.  If you need more of a small stubble beard with more refinement, you may want a smaller device. This device is almost 7.5 to 8 inches long and pretty heavy.  It can also be hard to make refine cuts with the device since it is big.  Be forewarned, it does not come with a traveling case or a haircut comb.  It only comes with a stubble and beard comb.  Both combs are really adequate for just regular beard cuts.  The stubble comb doesn&#x27;t cut small enough for my liking and there is no adapter to allow you to cut regular hair too.  If you want all the adapters, you have to buy either Titanium models HC5550 or HC5750.  3.0 to 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s first charge takes about a day, after that its a lot quicker.  Comes with two trimming blades that can be adjusted to different lengths.  Having a cordless cutter is so much better than a corded, especially when you have a squirming 3 year old to trim.  No more catching the cord on your leg or not having enough cord to reach the other side.  This cutter is much quieter than our regular cutter.  And I&#x27;m sure it was the loud buzz that scared my son.  This one still bother&#x27;s him a bit, but he&#x27;s not screaming bloody murder anymore.  This item can be used on the go and charged via outlet or USB port.</li>
    <li> I took this hair clipper with all it&#x27;s attachments to my Guatemalan \\&quot;family\\&quot; and EVERYONE immediately got a haircut, and the neighbors did too! No instructions necessary, as practically no one at the time spoke English and they switched out the attachments and tried all the speeds and their haircuts looked great. Highly recommended and at a good price. Thanks for giving me a chance to test it out and review it! And all my Guatemalan friends in need of hair cuts thank you too!</li>
    <li> I used this on my two year old and I got a lot fewer tears and objections than when we&#x27;d bring him into the kiddie salon. I think partially because we let him touch the guard while it was on so he could see that it didn&#x27;t hurt, just tickled a bit and that it is much quieter than full size or corded units. I&#x27;m sure that its not suited to particularly thick and/or long hair and it&#x27;s a little thinner than most, so more passes are required, but it fits our needs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Quiet!&lt;br /&gt;+ Guards slide up and down, so no switching necessary.&lt;br /&gt;+ Cordless and Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;+ Built in thinning switch&lt;br /&gt;+ Washable&lt;br /&gt;+ Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Light weight &#x3D; Light Duty?&lt;br /&gt;- Guard lengths are only in increments of 3 (0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21mm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ODD:&lt;br /&gt;o It&#x27;s USB rechargeable... I can&#x27;t think of a good reason since you don&#x27;t cut hair on a whim and away from conventional power (maybe one or the other) and the wall charger works just fine. I suppose the only real advantage it has by having a USB interface is that if you lose the charging cable a replacement is cheap and easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it&#x27;s not a device you&#x27;d open your salon with, but if you have a need for a basic buzz cut more than two or three times, then this thing will easily pay for itself quickly.</li>
    <li> I have an old Remington body shaver that I think is the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;This one is too big and not as easy to use for beard treaming.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is working well.</li>
    <li> Its a little large to trim beards</li>
    <li> Fantastic tool for all my in between haircuts.  Battery charge is good, cuts evenly and is easy to maintain!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have not used this much, but have used it to trim my hairline which grows longer than my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet&lt;br /&gt;Soft on the skin&lt;br /&gt;Quick&lt;br /&gt;Efficient&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy</li>
    <li> not great just okay type product ..started making noise in 5fth use.they need to work on quality. I had used some others better than this and cheaper than this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit bulkier than I wish it would be. Runs quietly, which is nice. Maybe it&#x27;s the shape of my head but it has problems with a consistent cut of all my head hair. Overall: good yet, could be better.</li>
    <li> Excente producto, gracias.....</li>
    <li> I mainly bought these because of the usb charging. It is brilliant. Every other item I have charges on microusb. Now when traveling I do not need more chargers. It is a pretty heavy trimmer which feels solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair with these and trim my beard. They work well for both functions. The battery holds a good charge. I get probably 7 days+ of trimming beard. Cutting hair takes a lot more juice but I never do that while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair trimmer attachment is kind of fragile. That is what deducted a star. One of the edge spokes broke off already. Makes me kinda concerned that my haircut will come out uneven. But so far I think my haircuts have looked okay and nobody has commented :/</li>
    <li> I wanted to use it to trim my bear. It is easy to use and functions well although nothing fancy about it.</li>
    <li> I cut my husbands hair and was disappointed that the machine comb heads were not low enough for his hair. Maybe it&#x27;s my fault in selecting this kind for him but I love Remington and preder to buy their products. Great product but not for Afro ethnic hair unless you are cutting it to almost bald in which case you use it with no comb head on</li>
    <li> A little wider than the previous models, a bit too wide for me.</li>
    <li> This might be a good hair trimmer, but it&#x27;s pretty bad as a beard trimmer.  Wish I had known that \\&quot;eight length settings for versatile trimming options\\&quot; means 8 settings over a 1 inch range.  With settings in 1/8 inch (3mm) increments, I couldn&#x27;t get the kind of fine control over beard length that I used to have with my 15-year old Panasonic beard trimmer.  And if that wasn&#x27;t a problem, the tines on the flimsy beard comb separate when pressed down too hard.  I used once and had one of the most uneven trims I&#x27;ve ever had.  In short, I returned it.  Lucky for me that Amazon took it back.  In its place, I purchased the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco QT4070 /41 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro]].  It has 1mm increments, sturdy beard comb, and a cool vacuum feature.  I&#x27;ve been happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product is too bulky to fit underneath your nose. Thus I DONT recommend it as a beard trimmer. Ended up using it to cut my hair instead to make the purchase plausible. It works pretty well for hair (on my head) so far, yet I wouldve preferred buying a professional hair trimmer for that.... 3 Stars only for the products quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loss of one star for the size and loss of one star for the picture not correctly depicting the products size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got the very similar model (HC5356).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an OK product with nice to haves but to be a good product it misses&lt;br /&gt;- to be able to cut short beard or hair. The plastic clips move too much that made my beard and hair uneven. Note that I wasn&#x27;t event using the smallest number in the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;- hair gets stuck in the blades and machine head and the products doesn&#x27;t come with a small brush to clean it (if such simple details are missing, I wonder what else is lacking!)&lt;br /&gt;- the small clipper (detail trimmer) is a very useful addition, but it&#x27;s a pity that it cannot be re-charged as well. It comes with a throw away battery. While turning the bottom to turn on/off I end up opening the device battery compartment all the time. Poor design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad, but not good either. Just OK.</li>
    <li> Terrible, won&#x27;t hold a charge at all.  Used this for less than a month.  Unusable, even when plugged in.  Extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> A little clunky, and attachment teeth are too wide. Though also called a haircut kit this model does not come with the haircut attachment. I use the beard attachment which works OK. When this one breaks, I will consider another manufacturer, not likely to buy again.</li>
    <li> I had to buy this as a gift but I ended up giving it to my dad because the gift giver said it is a type of razor that pulls the hair. I&#x27;m not sure if it does, but my father hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it whatsoever with pulling.</li>
    <li> It works well. It&#x27;s relatively quiet. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it after a few months. Remington manuals and packaging has always been back-handed and an afterthought, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised with the contradictions in included stuff (oil for never needs oiling, or usb cords etc).&lt;br /&gt;I guess at this price-point, there are no glaring warnings about this trimmer.</li>
    <li> showed up on time, its a great christmas gift, perfect for trimming hair, and beard little to no pulling on hair.</li>
    <li> hair comb does not fit &#x3D; the cutter does not work &#x3D; all around bad deal.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. EASY TO USE. GOOD VALUE. WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND IT. ON TIME DELIVERY FOR THIS PRODUCT. CHARGES QUICKLY.</li>
    <li> Great all around product. Sharp blades. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> From the professional grade cutting blades to the ability to charge via USB and run the device while plugged in, this Remington HC5350 beard and hair clipper has a lot going for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting options are fairly good, and the unit operates fairly quietly and fast.  Clean up is easy.  It works well as both a cutter and a trimmer.  I don&#x27;t really use the USB charging feature...I don&#x27;t see myself plugging this into my laptop any time soon, but I do use a USB wall outlet to charge this sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included documentation is insufficient, and you have to just guess at some things.  Although the product is advertised as never needing to be oiled, it paradoxically comes with a tube of oil for the blades.  For me, the HC5350 did not last for the advertised 40 minute runtime on a full charge, but it does last a sufficient amount of time.  I also have a gripe with the plastic levelers which can slide up or down if you handle the unit too roughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, the Amazon product features list says \\&quot;It does not contain a USB Cord\\&quot; yet the product description area for \\&quot;What&#x27;s in the box\\&quot;  says it contains a \\&quot;USB charging cord\\&quot;.  Mine had a USB charging cable.  Overall - for the price, this is a fairly good trimmer/cutter kit.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair and beard trimmer.  It has the smoothest cut and with the different length blades gives an excellent hair trim.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone for lots of uses.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and seems to last forever, I have dropped it, submerged it in water, accidentally stepped on it and it keeps going. I have been using it for at least 2 years and I have not had a problem yet. I only have one thing bad to say about it, it is a bit big for beards and does not give the clean cut I want for my beard.</li>
    <li> I use to have a beard. I love the easy-to-wash feature of this trimmer, the size is very appropriate for traveling and the usb charging is a plus. It comes with two attachment. One of the attachments offers 8 different positions (heights), whereas the other one is fixed (1 height). The difference between the fixed attachment and lowest height of the adjustable attachment is bigger than it should be. Therefore I could not find the intermediate height I wished.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer . Not great for beard.</li>
    <li> be careful, although the product looks good and seems to be working Ok, it will not last more then a month&lt;br /&gt;mine got all burned out and it never recharged after 3 days of usage.  total waste of money, what would i except for the price?! :(</li>
    <li> Long losting charging, fine trimming, working good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to improve in side burns and moustache trimming. Changing of blades required</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper head, very pleased. Before that I had a machine Philips - very poorly.</li>
    <li> A little bit larger than I expected</li>
    <li> Very good product for the money.</li>
    <li> i feel it well good&lt;br /&gt;i like it&lt;br /&gt;very much&lt;br /&gt;i like it like it like it like it ,</li>
    <li> This product does not turn on never. It´s not recommended to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Este producto no encendió nunca. No lo recomiendo comprar</li>
    <li> This i by far the best beard trimmer I have owned in recent years!  Every other brand I have tried have all died within a year, even after regularly cleaning and oiling them.  This one has been going strong and in addition to not dying out on me, it has more power and cuts better than all the other cordless beard trimmers I have tried.  Not only that, but the battery lasts FOREVER in this thing.  I hardly ever have to charge this thing, its actually impressive how long the battery lasts in it!</li>
    <li> it works while the charge cord in plugged in, good feature,</li>
    <li> everything is perfect about this when it comes to hair cutting or clipping but when you want to trim your beard it not good coz the width of it is more so you can not do it very easily.</li>
    <li> Really really nice. Im a hairdresser and bought it for a gift. Loved it</li>
    <li> This is a high quality and solid haircut but not much of a beard trimmer.. If you are looking for a great hair clipper, this is the one for you. Please don&#x27;t buy it if you are only getting for beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I love having an electric razor that I can charge and use again and again without wasting batteries. I also love that I can shave while it is charging. No more half shaves then waiting 2 hours for a device to charge or sending someone to the store for batteries. It is also super easy to clean. I like that I can run this over my face to get the majority of the hair off my face with ease then run a razor over my face for a quick super close shave. I have not use the hair attachments yet, however, I plan to next time I need my hair trimmed to see how it works. The main reason I wanted the device though was for a razor so I am still happy with my purchase regardless.</li>
    <li> Holds a charge, gets as close as I need for my self-inflicted hairdo&#x27;s.  Best of all, it was relatively inexpensive, and still works as of this writing.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Yeah, so what that everything is made of plastic isn&#x27;t everything these days? I got this unit to trim my chin beard, nothing else. I want the stubby look which the 1/16th&amp;#34; attachment does a fine job of. Noise level is between a Remington and Norelco electric shaver and very acceptable. Handle fits small hand [5&#x27;7&amp;#34; frame], holds charge well, and like that 1/16th, 1/8th, and 1&amp;#34; attachments can be purchased separately.</li>
    <li> This does an even trim every time! Much better than my last trimmer and worth the money. And I like the usb charger a well.</li>
    <li> I much like this product as this is really a nice deal and could shave nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will help us to save the money by shaving. (&amp;#34;Shaving beard Saving Money&amp;#34;) This is what I could feel, I can hv clean trimming at home itself.</li>
    <li> works good, I like it so far.</li>
    <li> I mostly use this for beard and sideburn trimming. It works well and seems to be good quality. As far as trimming the beard, the head seems a little big for that since this is designed for both haircuts and beards. I have found that you need to be careful guiding the trimmer or else you&#x27;ll inadvertently get an uneven cut. Other than that, this seems to be pretty durable and easy to maintain. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone looking for a multi-use device (haircuts and beard trimmer) but to also consider others like [[ASIN:B004WIUNCG Braun Cruzer 6 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer 1 Count]] which I use for just beard trimming.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was larger than expected and therefore did not do a good job of close trimming and outlining of a goatee.  Nice quality, but had to return due to size.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised, no complaints. Use the pop-up blade guard to do close trimming of beard or body hair. Cleans easily and looks professional.</li>
    <li> has no fade capability and blades suck. This product was my fifth pair of clippers that I&#x27;ve owned and the HC5350 was by far the worst in performance.</li>
