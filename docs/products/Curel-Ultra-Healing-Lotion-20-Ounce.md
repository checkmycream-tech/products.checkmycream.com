      <li>Ultra healing is still good</li>
      <li>Good price too.</li>
      <li>the Aveeno Baby Cleansing Therapy Moisturizing Wash. This is so good, I&#x27;ve even mailed it as a care package for my nephew in England to fight his eczema.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any scent which is good.  </li>
      <li>Still don&#x27;t know how good it is on healing.</li>
      <li>The lotion arrived quickly and feels great on my hands!</li>
      <li>I have been using it ever since, more as a preventative agent, and it has been working great.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; lotions to get relief from the itching or even hives I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>

      <li>Love this lotion!</li>
      <li>Amazing difference after just one use.</li>

      <li>This lotion is amazing..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Almost as effective as Kiehls.  </li>
      <li>A nice, hydrating lotion</li>

      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
      <li>This ultra healing lotion is great, but curel&#x27;s itch defence lotion has worked better for me on all levels, so it is worth comparing the two to find the best fit for you or your child.</li>
      <li>Excellent lotion keeps our skin very moist.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And to be honest, this lotion&#x27;s performance has deteriorated over the years, too.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin so nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>

      <li>By far the best lotion I have found.  </li>
      <li>Many are quite effective and of value.  </li>
      <li>Oh Ultra Healing is even better than Curel&#x27;s own eczema line.</li>
      <li>I love to try new lotions, but have to admit that Curel really does a great job of keeping my skin looking good in the winter!</li>
      <li>OK I did it.  </li>
      <li>glad I did.</li>
      <li>It works better than others I used.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite lotion for over 10 years.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i only use curel.  people at work come to my desk only and use my curel.  i think i have had so many peole tell my how soft my skin is and its due to my dove and curel use for so many years.  simple!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your skin feel really soft.  It is a very good product.  I alternate between this product and Jergens Ultra Healing.  I would recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great if you have dry skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave you looking oily. You can see it working after one use and you&#x27;ll never want to stop using it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, it arrived quickly and was packaged well.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! I don&#x27;t know about you but my face is so hard to please!!! When I put stuff on it to treat pimples it say... I&#x27;m to dry, when I put stuff for dryness it says that is making me to oily.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally use lotion on my face cause my face breaks out like crazy after oily stuff. But once I say it was non greasy I decided to give it a shot. The first day (about 20mins later) my face felt a lot smoother. I&#x27;ve been using it two times a day and both my pimples and dry skin have been fading, I find it amazing. I don&#x27;t expect that to be a reason for most of you to buy lotion, so I&#x27;m sorry if this didn&#x27;t help. But if you have pimples I suggest you give this a try!</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever. I always try new lotions and always come back to this one. It&#x27;s light weight, moisturizes perfectly. Skins stays moist without being oily for hours. Light scent so I can use perfume and body spray over it. It&#x27;s pretty much the perfect lotion.</li>
    <li> jury still out!  dealing with EXTREMELY hand and body dryness.  loved, loved, loved curel in the late past but it has NOT helped me in recent years but decided to try the new.  we&#x27;ll see..........</li>
    <li> A MUST for severely dry skin- I LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
    <li> I used to love this lotion and heartily recommended it to everyone.  However, the formula seems to be leaning more toward watery/gunky than in the past.  This means I have to use more lotion and tolerate more residue for the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the worst issue is that my last bottle purchased from Amazon had a different ingredient list from what is written in the description.  My bottle shows two paraben ingredients when I hadn&#x27;t expected any based on past purchases and the description.  Looking at the picture now, I see that the photo of the bottle shows the (updated?) actual ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Amazon will correct the description soon, but in the meantime be sure to check the photo of the bottle for the real ingredient list of what you&#x27;ll be receiving!  If the idea of parabens in your lotion bothers you, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this lotion for two years, but I&#x27;ll start looking for an alternative now.</li>
    <li> best lotion ever!  It&#x27;s moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I realized almost immediately after buying my last bottle that something had changed because it smelled funny--almost waxy/plasticky and it felt like it didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin but rather sat on the surface like an unbreathable film...it then made me start itching like crazy.  Like another reviewer here, it was then I noticed that they have ADDED parabens back into the ingredients.  I had been using this for many years but will stop now if it continues to have parabens.  Prior to the ingredient change I used to LOVE this moisturizer.  I think it&#x27;s terrible they didn&#x27;t notify the consumer in any way when they changed their ingredients--which really should be illegal since many people have chemical allergies and shouldn&#x27;t have to read the bottle of the same product they buy, every single time they buy it, due to the off chance that THIS time the ingredients are different than they were before;  instead, just let us know when it has been changed (which I am sure wasn&#x27;t done since they would have had to announce they added the parabens--hardly something to be proud of or something that the consumer wants).  I have a mast cell disorder and have to be aware of everything I use due to an almost mind-numbing list of allergies and sensitivities that can have serious health consequences. Too bad I need to shop for a new daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I felt its just like a base item, I ordered a perfumed new product,but I received a non-perfumed item.Its just too expensive comopare to other local store.I never go with amazon for these type of items.But its fast shipping . Too pricy</li>
    <li> I agree with the comments on how this formula has changed. For at least 11 years if not more Ive used Curel Ultra Healing as I have eczema and it kept it under control. I also like the smell as fragrances bother me. I know its got some other chemicals but they could not leave well enough alone. They just HAD to add the parabens. Your so called \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; is the reason Im looking for another lotion.    I refuse to put parabens on my skin as much as I use lotion. Ultra healing is still good but they should have not altered anything. Now Im stressing out and spending more money as I seek out other natural alternatives or at least ones with no parabens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema my entire life and I&#x27;ve tried everything including strong prescription ointments and creams, prescription antihistamines, herbal remedies, drugstore lotions and everything else you could imagine. But nothing worked, some even made my skin worse. And this was always frustrating because my face was always the part of my body affected most by my eczema and my embarrassing skin was always the first thing people would notice when talking to me. Recently my skin flared up dramatically. I woke up with eyes swollen shut and my skin was scaly, dry, crusty, oozing, cracked, scabbed, bleeding, red, irritated, burning, itchy, chapped to the point where I couldn&#x27;t open my mouth to eat because my lips and the area around my lips would crack open and bleed and this lasted for days while I searched, once again, for a miracle cure. I stumbled upon this product expecting nothing, but now, on the fourth day of using this product, I know I&#x27;ve found my miracle cure. Anyone with eczema as bad as mine on their face just yearns to have normal skin and I finally have it because of this product. My skin is healthy and moisturized. I honestly can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
    <li> Product works well and came in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best moisture creams I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have really dry feet and if I don&#x27;t use a cream my toes will slip and bleed in&lt;br /&gt;the joints.  Other creams help, but Curel ultra healing forms a protective film when it is applied.  It lasts much longer and does a better job than other lighter creams.</li>
    <li> Keeps you smooth all day.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this product only because it helps with dryness, unlike some other products.</li>
    <li> I find this lotion sticky after it&#x27;s applied, even if I&#x27;ve rubbed it in well.  It is gentle enough for me to use everywhere, even on my face and on my legs after shaving, and it lasts on my hands after washing them.  The lotion has a faint orange smell that&#x27;s not unpleasant.  I will probably use the rest of the bottle I have since it&#x27;s moisturizing enough for winter time, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because of the sticky residue.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion...  I have very dry skin and this lasts for hours and hours.  Well worth the $$.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that I have ever used that leaves my skin so incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Use this!</li>
    <li> Have on a monthly ordering plan- only lotion we use in our house- everyone has skin allergies and the only lotion that does not bother anyone!!</li>
    <li> Since moving to a dry climate, this lotion is the only thing that soothes my dry, cracked skin.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Only moisturizer I will use...  provides good moisture without leaving me feeling all greasy.</li>
    <li> I work in dermatology and love this moisturizer. I also have eczema/atopic dermatitis and have very dry, sensitive skin that requires daily application of moisturizers. This is the best that I have ever used. I have never had an adverse reaction to this and have also used it on my children, who also have atopic dermatitis. This is one of the more expensive OTC lotions but is well worth the price. Amazon seems to have the lowest price as well especially when use a coupon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on accutane which makes your skin super sensitive, as well as extremely dry. It&#x27;s also winter and I live in the north east, so I dry out and get eczema on my arms very easily. But if I apply this once a day my skin is completely fine. It goes on easily, isn&#x27;t greasy, and leaves a protective layer that lasts an incredibly long time. It&#x27;s lasted me 24 hours before, which is pretty incredible. The only downside to it in my opinion is that it smells strange, but the smell isn&#x27;t strong and goes away quickly.</li>
    <li> I take very low dose Accutane for my rosacea and thus need heavy duty moisturizer for my face and body. This one doesn&#x27;t get absorbed easily and sits on top of your skin. I apply it immediately after my shower but still it gets absorbed only partially. Easily rubs off from face to your pillow case if you apply it before going to bed. I wait for half an hour before going to bed but still it totally comes off on the pillow. And you wake up with very dry visible patches as if you never applied any moisturizer at all. Second, it leaves a slimy layer on my skin which is fine since this is the way these synthetic moisturizers prevent the loss of moisture from your skin and lock the moisture in.  When I wash my face, that layer comes off and once again my face feels very dry with red dry patches and no difference whatsoever in visible peeling. It doesn&#x27;t clog pores but doesn&#x27;t help with eczema either. I apply it multiple times a day but still no relief in dryness. Plus it has parabens. I am going to try Cetaphil or CeraVe now.</li>
    <li> This lotion works, especially during the dry winter months. I like the very light citrus fragrance, almost undetectable, but pleasant.</li>
    <li> I say this because my older Aunt used to use Curel products.  While she had beautiful skin, I thought that&lt;br /&gt;she just wasn&#x27;t up to date on the lotions and moisturizers.  I used another brand because I thought my brand was&lt;br /&gt;better.  Since moving to the desert over three years ago,  I find this brand much better&lt;br /&gt;for keeping my skin moisturized and subtle.  This brand is soothing, non greasy and has loads of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this lotion, it works really well and absorbs quickly.  I have extremely dry hands most of the time but they look great after using this product.  I will definitely buy it again once my 20 oz bottle is used up.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I use it on my dry skin, in the winter especially. My 2 year old has eczema and it has even helped him. Super product!</li>
    <li> Only lotion that keeps my skin from looking like I&#x27;m part alligator!!  absorbs quickly not really smelly last all day even after a second mid-day shower at the gum.</li>
    <li> one of the best creams I&#x27;ve used, it keeps me moisturized all day, not greasy. My husband also uses it, he is allergic to many products, but this cream helps with one of his problems is dryness of the skin without causing irritation.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this lotion to anyone even for babies with very dry skin problems. Especially to women who has really dry skin as they experience menopause!! I am telling you I&#x27;ve been there and I tried everything else and when I tried &amp;#34;CUREL ULTRA LOTION&amp;#34; there is none other than &amp;#34;CUREL&amp;#34; I vow to use curel, for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Amazon had the best price for this great product.  This is the only lotion I buy because my skin is extremely dry and this does the trick.</li>
    <li> ▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀█▓▒░▒░░░ PERFECT ░░▒░░▒▓█▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀</li>
    <li> The lotion arrived quickly and feels great on my hands!</li>
    <li> love the natural to the ski formula that Curel has come up with.  So soothing,;;;so natural to my skin. Not much if any chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great as always.Came just as I was finishing my last bottle, right on time.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FOR SENSATIVE SKIN, GREAT PRICE!! LOVE THIS LOTION!! FEELS FREAT ON MY SKIN TOO!!! THIS IS ALL I WILL EVER USE.</li>
    <li> Curel lotion is the only lotion for me.  I have very dry skin, I use it everyday and no other lotion works as good for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! After giving birth I experience very dry skin. I tried a lot of lotions, creams, oils. Nothing helped as well as Curel. It absorbs quickly, does not leave greasy feeling, has no smell and hydrates my skin instantly. I also noticed that I do not need to use it every day which is great because as a mom, sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the time for my regular routine.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and I really like how thick and emollient this feels. When she&#x27;s really struggling, I will use some stronger lotions like Stokolan (bought on amazon too). The whole family uses Curel and we like it!</li>
    <li> Use it daily after showering.  It&#x27;s not greasy and keeps my skin feeling smooth.  Priced well on Amazon compared to local drug/big box stores locally.</li>
    <li> So I read all the reviews on all the Curels, etc. I&#x27;m a fan of Curel while my wife likes a different brand. Previously I had used the daily or whatnot and it was great. I thought I would try this one, hoping the citrus smell or whatever it&#x27;s called wouldn&#x27;t be bad. I was wrong. Not only does it have a citrus smell - it has another type of smell in it. I can&#x27;t really quite describe it. But it&#x27;s terrible and I&#x27;m not mistaken - my wife smells it too. I&#x27;m going to stick to the zero smell of the daily.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and helps a lot during the winter.</li>
    <li> For the Winter dryness Curel Ultra Healing is what the entire family reaches for (have tried vaseline/nivea etc). Well worth the price for a superior product&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear, this is what I use for the body. For the face I prefer Nivea enriched cream...</li>
    <li> A few winters ago I was constantly battling dry hands/eczema.  Other lotions would simply mask the problem, cause further irritation, or were just not effective.  I gave this stuff a try based on the reviews and the Curel name.  I was not disappointed.  I have been using it ever since, more as a preventative agent, and it has been working great.  Every so often a steroid cream is still needed for a few spots, but overall, this stuff has been great.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion keeps our skin very moist.</li>
    <li> For the last two years (I&#x27;m 63 years old), I have truly suffered from very dry fingertips which have started flaking and cracking to the point of bleeding.  I have tried at least 20 different lotions and potions with only mediocre results...until I found a small 6 oz tube of this lotion which worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  But the tube was expensive, about $10, and didn&#x27;t last long and now I&#x27;ve been unable to find it in any store.  That&#x27;s why I was so thankful to finally find it in a large pump bottle for the unbelievable price of $8.07...thank you Amazon!!!&lt;br /&gt;Michael</li>
    <li> I was hopeful, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  Initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just me but this lotion takes several weeks to actually be affective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On application, it takes a while to absorb, and it is quite thick.  I heard complaints of an odor, but I don&#x27;t smell anything.  I didn&#x27;t think it was greasy either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost as effective as Kiehls.  Almost.</li>
    <li> Curel Ultra Healing Lotion has been my lotion of choice since shortly after it was introduced on the market. I loved it and used it daily. I am now throwing away my last bottle only half finished. The scent of this lotion for years was nearly unscented, it had a very faint citrusy scent that disappeared quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That has changed. Now it smells like sour milk. And the odor lingers. I thought I had simply bought an old bottle that had turned but after trying it in several different stores over the past year, it isn&#x27;t me, it&#x27;s the lotion. So this is my break up letter. I am sad because I really did love this lotion and was a loyal customer. I never even considered other lotions. My eye never wandered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to be honest, this lotion&#x27;s performance has deteriorated over the years, too. It has gotten greasier and less absorbent. But I kept on out of loyalty and a devotion to the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have started dating other lotions that don&#x27;t stink. So far Eucerin Calming Cream was okay, but it has parabens apparently and it is in a squeeze bottle. Too many negatives for a long term commitment. I need a pump to dispense lotion conveniently and would prefer no parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m searching for lotions I can stand to have near my face, especially as I sleep, since I moisture right before going to sleep at night and my hands are near my face when I curl up. Curel no longer comforts but irritates to the point where I have gotten up to wash my hands again. I have to find another choice before winter comes and lotion becomes a critical tool in my daily comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now trying Aveeno and while it&#x27;s not my Curel, it doesn&#x27;t make me wash my hands again after using it. It doesn&#x27;t stink. And it moistures fine, too. I&#x27;ll be trying others, too, so look for me sniffing lotion in the lotion aisles, hoping to find my next love affair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So good-bye Curel. It was a joy while it lasted....</li>
    <li> Great lotion at a great price. Subscribed!</li>
    <li> This has been a great product for my type of eczema (atopic dermatitis) but did you know that Curel also makes a lotion specifically for eczema? It&#x27;s the itch defence and it has the eczema seal of approval on it. You might want to check that one out and compare to see which one works best for you or your child. I was diagnosed when I was a wee little baby, so I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of lotions. As soon as I tried the itch defense by curel, I was in love. For me, it had no initial sting on contact and my immediate thought was &amp;#34;oh I wish we had this when I was younger! Woulda&#x27; saved me a bunch of pain!&amp;#34; That initial sting can be killer as a baby/toddler with gaping sores, and I found the itch defense curel to be awesome in that regard. The ultra healing for me stings just a little, so still much much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I also noticed that ultra healing numbed my itch for a while, which is awesome, but itch defence completely stops the itch for a great deal longer, which I love. My absolute favorite thing about curel though is that it feels light and breathable on my skin. I HATE the feeling of having stuff on my skin, you know-making everything you touch coated in greasy bleh and ruining clothes and bedding and being sticky and not being able to breathe- eww. Yeah. Curel is the best balance between protection and breathability I have found in the last 20 years, hands down. That being said, my skin stops responding to lotion after extended use, so I have to switch off between curel itch defense and Aveeno eczema therapy every now and then and I still use my prescription topical steroids for spot treatment and flare ups, so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: curel is my favorite brand. This ultra healing lotion is great, but curel&#x27;s itch defence lotion has worked better for me on all levels, so it is worth comparing the two to find the best fit for you or your child.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, so Curel is my go-to body lotion after every shower. It eases the tightness, with no residue. I also use it for my hands all day after washing.</li>
    <li> good product at a nice price.</li>
    <li> A nice big bottle of hand creme for about 8 bucks. It works better than others I used. It does not leave a slippery greasy residue. Wait, I will pump out a glob and use it right now.  OK I did it.  Hands are nice and soft and only the slightest bit greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and its the only lotion I m using. The price also is reasonable.</li>
    <li> And the only one that works!  Keeps skin moist for a long time without a greasy feel.  Does exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> Great value for such a good product</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It works so well and is such a great price.</li>
    <li> have used this for a lot of years.I have very dry skin.works very very good.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It helps keep my skin smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> Hard to find on the shelves sometimes. Works well on extra dry skin during the winter months with the windy days.</li>
    <li> Great lotion!  I use it every day, and order every month.  Seeps into skin and hydrates.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, Curel is the only lotion that I have found that makes my dry skin disappear.</li>
    <li> Find his very helpful for dry skin without leaving it greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Good product for everyone here at the office.</li>
    <li> I love what this does for my skin.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> The only lotion I use. I used to have itchy skin after a shower but after one use of this it completely stopped. Love that it has no scent as well &amp; you can&#x27;t beat having it delivered to your house by Amazon. The price is very good as well.</li>
    <li> All classic Curel lotions (including Ultra Healing) are more like cream than lotion. When you put it on your skin, you can feel the hydration right away and you don&#x27;t need to put a lot.  Other newer formulas tend to be more like watered down versions. I like both Original and Ultra Healing but I prefer Ultra Healing a little bit more.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion.  Does great things for dry summer skin.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Curel. In the winter months the Ultra Healing comes in handy/</li>
    <li> This lotion is fantastic, it really helps with dry skin for a long time. not too oily, but effective. the best!</li>
    <li> After just a few minutes of applying, this lotion is almost unnoticeable. I don&#x27;t get that greasy feeling, nor does it feel too watery like some lotions. It does a very good job of relieving dry skin.</li>
    <li> A nice, hydrating lotion</li>
    <li> This lotion smells like fish, with a touch of lemon.  Ew[...]  Maybe it contains fish oil.  It&#x27;s too bad, because I like the consistency.  The scent is disgusting.</li>
    <li> Love the Curel Lotion. It isn&#x27;t sticky &amp; a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> The best for very dry skin!</li>
    <li> I was having problem with my left ankle, open broken in accident. My skin in that anckle was very dry, until start using curel, Everything change to better</li>
    <li> I usually do not use lotion, but after having scars from a knee surgery, I needed something that would both help reduce the redness of the scars but also help heal them. I was recommended to use this, so I bought it and after using it a couple of times, my scars were already healed! It&#x27;s an amazing product, and it practically sinks into your skin as soon as you put it on, which makes everything easier than having a greasy residue. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am somewhat surprised that this product has received such high reviews. I started using Curel Ultra Healing about 10-12 years ago because in the winter my skin would get so dry that my shins burned and knuckles split and sometimes bled a little. The product was a miracle cure and to top it off, the stuff was extremely smooth and it neither make my hands greasy nor did it make my hands smell like any scented product! Over the past decade or so, the product has undergone several major changes with each subsequent version being significantly worse. The \\&quot;newest\\&quot; version (I think it&#x27;s been around for about two to three years now) is completely unusable in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel with ceramide is so unpleasantly greasy that I returned the bottle to the store immediately after trying it. It&#x27;s no longer smooth and it doesn&#x27;t absorb nicely like the old product used to, so my skin doesn&#x27;t improve as much. Unfortunately I&#x27;m almost out of my last bottle of the old stuff (silver bottle, although the older white bottle was even better), and I would gladly pay twice as much for more if I could find some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a Vaseline hand lotion I like (Vaseline Intensive Rescue Healing Hand Cream) to replace this, but it&#x27;s not so great as a body lotion. To be honest, it doesn&#x27;t do nearly the job the old Curel Ultra Healing used to do. Guess I&#x27;m back to searching...</li>
    <li> Awesome  lotion!  I don&#x27;t leave home without it.  You won&#x27;t  be disappointed in any of the 4 seasons.</li>
    <li> By far the best lotion I have found.  It is the only thing that touches my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, nice big bottle,rich quality. nice smell. it works good on very dry legs. my new brand of lotion.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Curel Ultra Healing if you live in a cold climate and/or have very dry skin. For overnight use, though, try O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands, as it is stronger.</li>
    <li> Curel Ultra Healing Lotion is such a pleasure that each of us &#x27;hit the bottle&#x27; as soon as it arrives.  It provides sufficient lubrication during those dry winter, humidity free months.  At a time when it appears that almost every lotion company has a plethora of magical healing products.  Many are quite effective and of value.  Curel has and is our number one choice.</li>
    <li> Hands down the &#x27;Best&#x27; thing on the market for dry skin!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find the one I bought a few years ago but this works just as good. It has not scent but does smell like lotion.  Keeps my hands normal all winter long.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price!!</li>
    <li> HAVING VERY DRY SKIN I NEEDED A CREAM THAT FELT COOL AND HEALING...IT MET THE REQUIREMENT OF COOLNESS, BUT ONLY MODERATELY WAS IT HEALING TO AREAS THAT NEEDED IT....IT WAS REASONABLY PRICED, CAME QUITE QUICKLY.</li>
    <li> You certainly get what you pay for, especially when using Curel. After trying several types/brands of lotions, this one works very well for my family and I.</li>
    <li> Searching for quality lotion in these harsh MI winters. This lotion is very thin and burns if your hands are dry and cracked, as mine are. Then it doesn&#x27;t soak in very well and seems to just wash off in a slimy mess when you wash your hands within a couple of hours of application. Because of the burning I assumed there&#x27;s something in this that&#x27;s not good for the skin so I just threw my hardly-used tube out.</li>
    <li> This lotion is excellent for dry skin even on the feet. Amazing difference after just one use. Recommended for my face by my dermatologist for very dry skin. Wonderful product, lightly scented that disapates very fast. Have allergies to fragrance and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I live  in a very very dry desert climate and i am 67, fair-skinned, i dry out easily.  i can&#x27;t afford expensive creams.  i use a lot of body  moisturizer , so i&#x27;ve had to search for something effective but not expensive.  Curel&#x27;s &amp;#34;ultra healing&amp;#34; is the best one i&#x27;ve found.  i used it all over after  my shower and it keeps me moisturized all day.  i have something else i use for my face, however.  but this is the best body lotion for the price.  very good.  curel makes a lot of different ones, this one is my favorite, &amp;#34;ultra healing&amp;#34; .</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I READ INJUSTICE FOR ALL\\&quot; ON MY AMAZON KINDLE, AND GOT THE BOOK FROM AMAZON KINDLE BOOKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS BOOK WAS EXCELLENT, FAST MOVING, WITH CHARACTERS YOU COULD IDENTIFY WITH,  AND REMEMBER. GREAT PLOT. IT IS THE BEST OF SCOTT PRATT&#x27;S THUS FAR, AND I HAVE READ ALL OF HIS NOVELS. IT IS UP THERE WITH THE BEST OF THEM. NEVER DULL. I RE-READ NOVELS THAT I REALLY ENJOY, SO I WILL BE VISITING THOSE CHARACTERS AGAIN.  I LOOK FORWARD TO HIS NEXT EFFORT!&lt;br /&gt;  LAURA GOOD</li>
    <li> Great lotion for dry skin. My heels have been dry for as long as I can remember. I used all other brands and decided to try Curel and I am sue glad I did. After 3 months use my heels look like they did when I was a kid, so soft. Great lotion with little smell!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best &amp; most smooth lotion we have used so far.</li>
    <li> Thought it is not noted, it is for extra dry skin, which is out of my expectation and very good. It is a little oily when you rub it onto your skin after bath, but it feels soft and light after a while. It doesn&#x27;t have any scent which is good.  Still don&#x27;t know how good it is on healing. After all it won&#x27;t happen over night. Good product.</li>
    <li> I cannot stress how much I love this lotion!  It absorbs into the skin so nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I&#x27;ve use so many different brands of lotion over the years and I&#x27;ve been using nothing but this lotion for the past five years.  I like this lotion more than the expensive, brand name hand creams that you buy at specialty shops.  I&#x27;ve tried the regular unscented version from Curel (the green label) and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Ultra Healing, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope Curel doesn&#x27;t change their formula for this one!  Scared me for a second when they changed the label design and bottle color a few years back.</li>
    <li> Cruel was advised to me by a doctor. I have very dry skin in the winter and it totally does the job.</li>
    <li> God forbid there be a skin moisturizer out there that I have not tried. Over the past 3years illness and multiple meds have made my skin drier than the Mojave.  I had been using Aveeno 24 hour for the past year and been satisfied but not bowled over with its performance.  I must say the same for my first foray into Curel.  The best part of the purchase is my first use of an Amazon coupon along with free shipping really appealed to the shopper in me.</li>
    <li> In a meeting at work, we were all discussing products that we are advocates for to our friends and family. A female co-worker mentioned how she recommends her Curel Ultra Healing lotion to people after she had issues with dry hands, especially in the winter. Worked well, stayed effective for hours, but never greasy. Then all the women in the office were going to her to try it that day. With my dry hands in the winter - they get red and splotchy - my lotion clearly was not enough, so I had to try it. I bought the big bottle that weekend at my local supercenter and have stuck with it ever since. I only put it on at night, one pump for my hands and elbows, and my hands have been great. I always take a small tube to travel, and keep one at work for problems in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since recommended it to others, and people love it when they come visit and borrow my lotion. They find that a little goes a long way with this as well, compared to many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few products where I didn&#x27;t use what my mom recommended, and have since gotten her to test it out!</li>
    <li> The best of the Curel lotion collection, I use it on my 8yo who has eczema and very dry skin. It does not sting or cause rashes and is non irritating. PLUS contains ceramides which help hold moisture into the skin (per our dermatologist), so is a MUST for us. We usually use creams but find this thick (yet not greasy) lotion to meet our needs without causing any skin drying. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> The children did not scratch anymore</li>
    <li> Excellent high quality body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy next time again and I will  also try foot cream too.</li>
    <li> I use this on my sensitive, oily-prone skin-face and body. Never have had a bad reaction. With a faint hint of natural orange fragrance, it&#x27;s pleasant and not sticky--absorbs quickly, yet is very moisturizing. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> This lotion moisturizes my dry skin very well.  The price was right and shipped on time.  Unfortunately I recently found out it contain parabens so I most likely won&#x27;t buy again unless they take them out.</li>
    <li> Red (Ultra) is oily and does not absorb very well. Blue label Daily is much better, worth the extra buck.</li>
    <li> I have severely dry skin. I mix this with a few drops of grapeseed oil when I get out of the shower.....</li>
    <li> Love this lotion it really works on super dry or damaged skin.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> it saves my dry skin!</li>
    <li> After a year of battling eczema on my newborn this was the only stuff that finally worked. I had tried neosporin  brand, aveeno, nutregena, Johnson&#x27;s any thing I could get my hands on this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> Staple in my household. Not sticky or greasy like Eucerin or Vaseline or Cetaphil. Helps my two boys fight off eczema. I lather it on as a post shower routine for them. I also have sensitive skin on my face and use this as well. I&#x27;ve tried everything from California Baby, to herbal creams, to Aveeno. This one is the best. I use this in combination with the Aveeno Baby Cleansing Therapy Moisturizing Wash. This is so good, I&#x27;ve even mailed it as a care package for my nephew in England to fight his eczema. Oh Ultra Healing is even better than Curel&#x27;s own eczema line.</li>
    <li> I love to try new lotions, but have to admit that Curel really does a great job of keeping my skin looking good in the winter!</li>
    <li> Great deal on 20 oz bottle of the best lotion around. I have been using this for years &amp; I still love it &amp; how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I buy. It&#x27;s not heavy or too perfume smelling. I won&#x27;t try anything else; this is the one.</li>
    <li> This Curel Ultra healing lotion is the best. I love this product. Keeps my skin super soft without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I have really dry, sensitive skin and ezema. I have tried so many &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; lotions to get relief from the itching or even hives I&#x27;ve experienced. My dermatologist recommended this one. Using it daily, I don&#x27;t experience anything bad, but instead I have soft, smooth, hydrated skin. The itching, redness and ugly apperance of bumps are gone. If you haven&#x27;t tried this wonderful lotion before, it is a thick, creamy lotion that is easy to apply. It hydrates you all day long. It is the only lotion we use in the household now. My granddaughter even rubs a little on her lips at night before climbing into bed. She doesn&#x27;t get chapped lips like she used to. Big thumbs up!</li>
    <li> great on the skin but a bit of a medicine smell, it goes away after a bit</li>
    <li> Lotions can be expensive and many don&#x27;t to the job. But Curel Ultra Healing works and is a bargain on Amazon.</li>
    <li> After using several brands, I&#x27;ve chosen this one as the best one, my skin doesn&#x27;t look like a snake skin anymore.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing..my skin is dry and scaly as a snakes skin but after using this lotion its softer than a babys bottom!</li>
    <li> After finding cetaphil lotion, this one took backseat. It&#x27;s still great lotion but not near as moisturizing as cetaphil.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive, dry skin. Provides lasting moisture and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with dry hands especially in the winter.  This is far and away the best lotion I have ever found.  It moisturizes my hands and does it without being greasy.  The moisture lasts for hours.  It&#x27;s great.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Decent lotion for the price!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin on my legs, and this is the lotion my doc recommended. Works great, absorbs into skin, and doesn&#x27;t smell to much. I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion.  Works great, absorbs quickly, has a very light pleasant scent.  Just perfect!</li>
    <li> This is the brand we use all the time, as well as Cetaphil. We live in the desert, so we need tons of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fair price.  Delivered to my doorstep in two days for free (PRIME)  :  )</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Gentle enough to use on face\\&quot; : This is definitely not true. Especially if you have sensitive skin. I use this for body lotion but when I ran out of face lotion, I thought I would give this a try.    If used on face, it will leave a sticky/oily feel.    Works fine as body lotion but -2 stars because I CAN&#x27;T use it on your face.    Smells: light lemony-citrus    PS: FACE AND BODY skin is different and one should never apply body lotion to their face as body lotion is less sensitive and feels/is different.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions for dry rough spots. I noticed it worked well after using about week.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite lotion for over 10 years. I have very dry, sensitive skin, and have yet to find something that gives all-day moisture!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for my extra dry skin.  I gave four stars because it states that it \\&quot;helps heal and protect extra-dry skin\\&quot;.  I have been using this lotion for months now and I do not feel like any healing has taken place.  It moisturizes my skin for the day or my hands in between washes. Nevertheless, it is a great lotion option for regular use - just do not expect healing as this product claims.</li>
    <li> Most stuff that is touted for dry skin doesn&#x27;t even phase mine.  I&#x27;ve got mild ichthyosis and for as long as I can remember (35+ years) my skin has been dry, cracking, crunchy, flaky, painful, etc.  It&#x27;s been somewhat controllable, summers being almost normal with the help of lotion, but fall/winter being completely miserable.  Most lotions disappear as soon as I put them on, and definitely don&#x27;t last the day.  That alligator on the Lubriderm commercial... yeah.  When I was a kid I used to rub petroleum jelly on my skin at night in the winter to help (doctor&#x27;s suggestion).  No fun being greasy all night but it helped to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY, recently my girlfriend found this for me.  It&#x27;s a miracle.  Seriously this is the first time ever that I have an idea what it&#x27;s like to have normal skin.  It only took about a week of every day use (after a shower) to have my skin feeling smoother and flexible.  After a couple weeks now, I don&#x27;t have the flaking issues any more, water in the shower actually runs off my skin now, and best of all it&#x27;s very reasonably priced.  I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am, especially with winter coming on and the air being dry.  I wish I could give it 10 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have excessively dry skin this stuff is probably overkill for you and might feel greasy.  If you&#x27;re like me, you want it a little greasy or it will vanish as soon as you put it on.  Let me clarify though, it&#x27;s not like \\&quot;clothes stick to your skin\\&quot; greasy, it rubs in well but still sticks with you through the day.  If you&#x27;ve rowed through lotions like I have you know what I mean, some vanish and some leave you feeling, well, greasy but not lubricated or supple.  I&#x27;m usually a pessimist when it comes to manufacturers claims, but I believe what they have on their label after using this for a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a slightly odd smell as soon as you put it on (acidic is the only way I can think to describe it) but that&#x27;s gone almost immediatelyafter you rub it in.  Doesn&#x27;t burn or sting or have any other oddities I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bless you Curel!!!</li>
    <li> Curel body lotions one of the very best (at least within my price range). Good value; use less to accomplish more. Good feel on skin, not greasy.</li>
</ol>
