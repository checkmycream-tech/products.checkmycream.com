    <li> You can see results in only one app! PERFECT!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 20 years. I really love this product. I use it along with other conditioners. I like to use half of the intense hydrator and half of the other conditioner. I really like the way it gives you more control over your hair. It helps to make your hair less frizzy and more controllable.</li>
    <li> Love this product, my daughter and I both use it and love it.  It brings life back to my hair.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by a stylist she hit the nail on the head! This leaves your hair soft. Im a man with long hair and my curls pop with this stuff love it. Women compliment me on my hair. I wash it out then I add a little back in on just the ends. Price piont is a rip off on here TJ Maxx sells this for $17</li>
    <li> Great smell and it works well on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why the picture shows the small container. I ordered this thinking that I was going to get the small hydrator but got the big one instead. Well, maybe they will change the image for the right one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this product is totally amazing. As soon as you put in on your hair feels different. I wished I had bought this from the beginning, I would had saved about a hundred dollars. But because I found it too expensive I decided to buy substitues. Well, the substitutes did nothing for my hair, so I ended up buying this one. My god, I had never tried a product so good.</li>
    <li> Intense moisturizer for my relaxed, dry hair</li>
    <li> even in the deep humidity of a midwest summer, my hair is soft and hydrated. i shampoo once every other week, and use joico intense hydrator every morning in the shower. my hair has way fewer split ends and dryness than before, and i&#x27;ve been using it for almost a year now. i dont think i&#x27;ll ever buy another conditioner ever. only complaint is the price: $30 is a little steep. but worth it</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for my hair! Shipped fast and makes my hair feel so much thicker and soft.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair extremely soft and manageable.  I would definitely recommend this product (the whole K-Pak product line) for African Americans with natural hair.</li>
    <li> Joice K Pak Moisture Intense Hydrator for Dry and Damaged Hair is an excellent product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The final step (of 4) in a fabulous system. Leaves hair shiny, hydrated, and feeling &amp;#34;weighted&amp;#34; like healthy hair. Thick, luxurious product with a phenomenal clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> This product really works and lasts literally. forever. I shre this big bottle with my two sisters and it lasts months before i have to purchase another bottle. My hair has never been so soft,shiny,healthy and easy to work with. Just a tip, leave it in longer that directed. Your hair. Will be wayyy softer!</li>
    <li> I credit this with the reason I can go 8 months between hair cuts and still not have split ends.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  Leaves hair soft and manageable every time.</li>
    <li> great stuff for you hair</li>
    <li> If your hair likes protein, it will like K-Pak.  Leaves hair very soft and results last for days.  A little goes a long way and this economical size is also economically priced.</li>
    <li> Great product, moisturizes without leaving any build up or greasy looking hair. It also helps detangle my sun damaged hair.</li>
