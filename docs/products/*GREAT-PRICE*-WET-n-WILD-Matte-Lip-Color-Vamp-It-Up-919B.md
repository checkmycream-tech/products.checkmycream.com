      <li>This is a great dupe or alternative for MAC&#x27;s Cyber but has a bit more sheen</li>
      <li>I feel like it would look good on anyone with a neutral to cool undertone.</li>
      <li>THANKS GUYS GREAT PRODUCT.</li>

      <li>I really love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about.</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>love this color.</li>
      <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I do make sure that I wear a liner</li>
      <li>More purple than I thought it would be</li>
      <li>Under good lighting it looks like a beautiful dark purple.</li>
      <li>I bought the Spotlight Red one and it is so beautiful.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the color is great for the colder months either by itself or for adding dimension to a red lipstick.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;M LOOKING FABULOUS</li>
      <li>But it was a cheap way to try a color</li>
      <li>It looks great sheer, too.</li>
      <li>It is a bit daring, but that is exactly what I love about it.</li>
      <li>dark purple looks great on my brown skin.</li>
      <li>Good way to fix that is to wear a dark lip liner underneath</li>
      <li>Nice color, dry formula.</li>
      <li>The lipstick arrived earlier than expected and was packaged great to protect it during shipment.</li>
      <li>Very versatile.</li>
      <li>Was really looking forward to using this</li>
      <li>Also shown well on various skin colors from light ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s that sexy dark vampy look</li>
      <li>I love these little things.</li>
      <li>It almost looks black, but if you get a good look at it, it looks like the deep purple that it actually is.</li>
      <li>Lasts pretty long.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than the matte MAC lipsticks, and same color payoff.</li>
      <li>It stays on Pretty well for 4 bucks you just have to re apply a few time when first trying to get it to stay on.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s rich and dark and matte, and still creamy and dos not dry your lips.</li>
      <li>This is a nice color but it can&#x27;t look a little messy.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if I would call it a true matte lippy.</li>
      <li>This was a really good price, i just don&#x27;t have the coloring to pull it off and my upper lip is too thin to wear a dark color like that.</li>

<li> Under bad lighting, it looks like a beautiful black purple color.</li>
<li> (it&#x27;s actually $1.99 or so at other places) speaks volumes about the quality.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a super dark purple, almost black, and looks really edgy when applied &amp;#34;full strength&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s just to dark for me to wear in public.</li>
<li> Personally I just can&#x27;t work the black lips look.</li>
<li> I finally found a color that isn&#x27;t black but still in the purple colors.</li>
<li> but I think the consistency could be creamier and less dry.</li>
<li> Is a matte, so if it feels dry, I add a little balm, not gloss</li>
<li> This is VERY dark purple and actually almost black!</li>
<li> to dark.</li>
<li> Waaaaay to dark for me.</li>
<li> Im of darker complexion, i was scared it would be too dark for my preference...</li>
<li> It makes me feel really dark and gothic.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if its because their not use to seeing people wearing dark lipstick or because they like it.</li>
<li> I had thought this was a black, but it&#x27;s just really dark purple.</li>
<li> If your looking for an almost black lipstick then this would be for you.</li>
<li> The formula is a little drying, but lip balm under or gloss over would fix that.</li>
<li> It is very dark.</li>
<li> Definitely dry so I do glide on a thin layer of carmax or chapstick.</li>
<li> you can buy it at Walgreens for $2.19 :/ if it wasn&#x27;t as over priced on here as it is, it would feinitely be a 5 stars</li>
<li> Ridiculous.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not that bad</li>

    <li> Love it. Also shown well on various skin colors from light ... fair .. to dark. Very versatile.</li>
    <li> Nice color, dry formula. But it was a cheap way to try a color I wasn&#x27;t sure about.</li>
    <li> I had thought this was a black, but it&#x27;s just really dark purple. However, this is still a wonderful color, and I love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color. absolutely love it. it&#x27;s rich and dark and matte, and still creamy and dos not dry your lips. the only thing i dont like is the price. you can buy it at Walgreens for $2.19 :/ if it wasn&#x27;t as over priced on here as it is, it would feinitely be a 5 stars</li>
    <li> This was a really good price, i just don&#x27;t have the coloring to pull it off and my upper lip is too thin to wear a dark color like that.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous matte shade for Fall!!  Much cheaper than the matte MAC lipsticks, and same color payoff.</li>
    <li> This color is so awesome! I finally found a color that isn&#x27;t black but still in the purple colors. you do not need a lot on you lip at all for it to show. Wet and Wild did well making this color!</li>
    <li> Definitely dry so I do glide on a thin layer of carmax or chapstick. Otherwise I love it.</li>
    <li> Looovvveeee this color! It&#x27;s that sexy dark vampy look</li>
    <li> I really love this lipstick. It&#x27;s a super dark purple, almost black, and looks really edgy when applied &amp;#34;full strength&amp;#34;. It looks great sheer, too. The formula is a little drying, but lip balm under or gloss over would fix that.</li>
    <li> love this color. dark purple looks great on my brown skin. I always get compliments. I do make sure that I wear a liner so I dont know if it bleeds by itself. Lasts pretty long. Is a matte, so if it feels dry, I add a little balm, not gloss (matte isnt supposed to shine).&lt;br /&gt;bought another tube for when i run out</li>
    <li> Buy it! I bought it for Halloween after another one I bought didn&#x27;t work. This lipstick was great. I love the color.</li>
    <li> Bought this and the lipstick product just came out as soon as I opened it. Was really looking forward to using this but no. Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it great color too.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Im of darker complexion, i was scared it would be too dark for my preference...but nope!! It is perfect, my friend is buying one now!! :)</li>
    <li> Waaaaay to dark for me. For Halloween or dressing up for a photo shoot or something like that this lipstick would be good but it&#x27;s just to dark for me to wear in public. If your looking for an almost black lipstick then this would be for you. It stays on Pretty well for 4 bucks you just have to re apply a few time when first trying to get it to stay on.

    <li> I love this color...It is so perfect...</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff. It is very dark. It almost looks black, but if you get a good look at it, it looks like the deep purple that it actually is. I wore it out today and I do get looks from people. I don&#x27;t know if its because their not use to seeing people wearing dark lipstick or because they like it. Under good lighting it looks like a beautiful dark purple. Under bad lighting, it looks like a beautiful black purple color. I&#x27;ve read that its just like MACs Cyber. I think that&#x27;s the one. I bought this online (which I regret) because these are sold at Wal-Mart for $1.97. I paid $3.97 on Amazon. I bought the Spotlight Red one and it is so beautiful. I love these little things. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Ordered on a saturday and got it on a monday. just how i wanted it. The lipstick was beautiful</li>
    <li> AWESOME LOVING IT, HUGE SENSATION IN THE CLUB AND EVERY WHERE I GO I&#x27;M LOOKING FABULOUS AS ALWAYS THANKS GUYS GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> The lipstick arrived earlier than expected and was packaged great to protect it during shipment. This is a great dupe or alternative for MAC&#x27;s Cyber but has a bit more sheen so I&#x27;m not sure if I would call it a true matte lippy. Otherwise, the color is great for the colder months either by itself or for adding dimension to a red lipstick. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE this color. It is one of my go-to lipsticks. I feel like it would look good on anyone with a neutral to cool undertone. It is a bit daring, but that is exactly what I love about it.</li>
    <li> This is VERY dark purple and actually almost black! It&#x27;s not that bad but I think the consistency could be creamier and less dry. I think for the price (it&#x27;s actually $1.99 or so at other places) speaks volumes about the quality. Buy She-Devil by NYX instead. It&#x27;s a perfected and improved version of this.</li>
    <li> Drier than I thought it would be</li>
    <li> This is a nice color but it can&#x27;t look a little messy. Good way to fix that is to wear a dark lip liner underneath &amp; you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> More purple than I thought it would be but I still like it. Lipstick is fragile as mine broke even though I didn&#x27;t twist it up in the tube.</li>
