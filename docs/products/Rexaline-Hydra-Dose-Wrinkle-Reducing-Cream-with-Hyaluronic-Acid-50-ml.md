### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The texture is perfect for even application.  </li>
      <li>Perfect, shipping and cream</li>
      <li>and she is very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>Great face cream!!  </li>
      <li>its a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>, so any product that makes an improvement in my skin -- even if it&#x27;s just the way it feels -- well, that makes me happy.</li>
      <li>This is a great moisturizing cream.</li>
      <li>Good moisturizer and good price!</li>
      <li>It is good as a moisturizer but not an antiwrinkle cream.</li>
      <li>Now that I have used this for a good 2 months...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 32 with fair, freckled skin.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I love this!  </li>
      <li>That way there is more for me!</li>
      <li>Rexaline has a beautiful and expensive-feeling container, a really wonderful scent, but bottom line is that I see no difference using this for 30 days over using my regular [[ASIN:B001E7688Q</li>
      <li>When it was no longer available, I turned to Amazon and was happy to find it.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I both liked the way it smells</li>
      <li>/&gt;But it does smell and feel nice.  </li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s warm again, and the sun has been drying me out(especially</li>
      <li>The cream has a very light rose fragrance that I like.</li>
      <li>It works with my skin very well and moisturizes very good...</li>
      <li>report: very easy to apply and most of all doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling, something that cheaper products sometimes do.</li>
      <li>, the listing clearly states:  creating a plumping effect that minimizes the look of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the ideal candidate for this as I have very fine lines showing in my forehead</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad they sell it on Amazon because although I still have the full bottle there wasn&#x27;t any more at Ross as its kind of a hit or miss place and felt a bit panicked at not being able to buy more!</li>
      <li>I have tried so many creams and nothing works.  </li>
      <li>Even my makeup looks better because it goes on smoother and looks more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>but love it as a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Although the Garnier worked well, this one is a much better moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Since the product packaging states 8 weeks for best results, when used in conjunction with another Rexaline product which we don&#x27;t have, I can&#x27;t give a final judgment (Amazon requires reviews within 30 days).</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion, SPF 15, 2.5 Ounce (</li>
      <li>and I apply Neutrogena lotion (SPF30) on top of it for morning application.</li>
      <li>but I was ready to drive over the bottle to get at the rest of this great night cream!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and I end up beating on the top to get it to come out and nothing works.  </li>
      <li>I felt it had a bit of a greasiness to it that does better soaking in while I sleep.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also impressed at the ingredients--no parabens, in particular, unlike most powerful creams.</li>
      <li>The packaging is nice, the smell is nice, the product is very moisturizing...</li>
      <li>I love the smooth texture of this cream.....</li>
      <li>I  also very picky as I want what I want and also need a good under foundation lotion.</li>
      <li>So far as face cream goes it seems very nice with a light pleasant scent and seems to be very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This is a repurchase since I had nice results the first time around.</li>
      <li>Definitely a pleasant and easy to use product with clear hydration</li>
      <li>The foundation goes on smoother and doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines now.</li>
      <li>I believe it does help minimize fine lines.</li>
      <li>It has a light fragrance.</li>
      <li>The scent is so light as to be almost unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So from a very picky woman to give this product such a good rating, yea, it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m delighted with the results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
      <li>but it does seem to have a mild plumping effect on my fine lines.</li>
      <li>I have good skin but very sensitive to too much product.  </li>
      <li>I was totally surprised that my fine lines did look better after using this product.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to find any type of face cream that makes much difference when it comes to getting rid of wrinkles and fine lines.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Rexaline is a smooth, buff-colored cream with a nice floral scent that is subtle and it goes on very easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed recently more fine lines popping up, especially when I smile.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, the Rexaline&#x27;s subtle botanical scent is much more pleasant.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant botanical smell that fades quickly, and absorbs in a few minutes.</li>
      <li>You just need a little bit of this cream to keep your skin moisturized - one pump is good for the face and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy as it&#x27;s absorbed quickly.</li>
      <li>Works nicely within a few minutes to minimize fine lines and hydrate.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what the name says in hydrating your skin.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried it was when we got from Vine</li>
      <li>The chemical smell put me off at first.</li>
      <li>and it never fails to deliver.</li>
      <li>If the anti-wrinkle aspect works out, then \\&quot;maybe\\&quot; as this is a pretty costly cream.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Really good for dry, sensitive older skin.</li>
      <li>I used nightly and it moisturizes very well...</li>
      <li>My skin looked youthful hydrated smooth and younger.</li>
      <li>I am a makeup artist with really messed up skin in the winter.</li>
      <li>The cream has a faint, pleasant scent that fades quickly and works well with foundation.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I saw that Amazon carried Rexaline, I ordered several!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried creams with hyaluronic acid as a main ingredient before, and never noticed much of an impact.</li>
      <li>It looks great and has a small window along its side to allow the user to see how much is left</li>
      <li>Works better than any other product I tried!  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I think most women are looking for more, like a fulfillment of the promise made in the product description.</li>
      <li>No seriously, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
      <li>The main ingredient is Hydrolonic Acid which is the main ingredient that makes of Hylunia skin care which is the biggest product used in spas...</li>
      <li>I first purchased this in a major cosmetics retail chain.  </li>
      <li>On the whole I do really like, though don&#x27;t know if I can personally justify the price tag when I have other more affordable things that work just as well.</li>
      <li>Really works on my ultra sensitive</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to be overly sensitive to scent, this one is just too much for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about two weeks, and am noticing that my skin does feel more firm.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure that all my &#x27;fine lines&#x27; will be gone after 8 weeks, especially since I&#x27;m not using the companion product, and you still need something for sunscreen, but this definitely lives up to its &#x27;hydrating&#x27; claim and will last you a good while.</li>
      <li>With this, I skipped my serum and still had better results than usual.</li>
      <li>I am not sure if it works or not; the perfume used in the cream is so overwhelming that there is no way I could continue to use it.  </li>
      <li>She likes the applicator bottle design as it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t waste any of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s more expensive than Olay ProX, I might just wait few more years to consistently buy and use Rexaline.</li>
      <li>I do see a marked difference in the way my skin looks.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use much and it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary to do so.  </li>
      <li>I did not have that experience this time and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m almost 70 years old</li>
      <li>I use it right after doing a daily scrub at the end of the day, and at first there is a slight tingly sensation.</li>
      <li>also that line is very expensive but works great.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, but I really like it.</li>
      <li>My face also looks younger and feels soft after using Rexaline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pack of 2)]], and the Rexaline also is missing any SPF factor, which I feel is more important than any expensive \\&quot;Hyper-hydrating\\&quot; additive in the fight against premature aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I  also 7 months pregnant which really strips my skin and makes me look tired.</li>
      <li>But that is a minor detail that I will live with to have hydrated skin.</li>

    <li> Perfect, shipping and cream</li>
    <li> The chemical smell put me off at first. I use it right after doing a daily scrub at the end of the day, and at first there is a slight tingly sensation. I was afraid my skin was reacting to it, but over time, the feeling lessens. Now after using it about a month, I find I like the consistency and moisturizing effect of this cream. However, I have yet to notice any &#x27;wrinkle reducing&#x27; effect. That said, it does work well as a moisturizer (though an expensive one).</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist with really messed up skin in the winter. I  also 7 months pregnant which really strips my skin and makes me look tired. I have tried so many creams and nothing works.  I  also very picky as I want what I want and also need a good under foundation lotion. No matter what I&#x27;ve used foundation still looks gross on my dry sensitive skin. I went to Ross clothing store. I decided to look thru the lotions and after close comparing of products I chose this one...and I&#x27;m very glad I did.  The main ingredient is Hydrolonic Acid which is the main ingredient that makes of Hylunia skin care which is the biggest product used in spas...also that line is very expensive but works great. I put this lotion on in my car and was amazed at the immediate result. My skin looked youthful hydrated smooth and younger. I even put it on my hands. The next day I applied it as a primer because applying my makeup. The foundation goes on smoother and doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines now. It also stays on longer.  So from a very picky woman to give this product such a good rating, yea, it&#x27;s good stuff. I&#x27;m glad they sell it on Amazon because although I still have the full bottle there wasn&#x27;t any more at Ross as its kind of a hit or miss place and felt a bit panicked at not being able to buy more!</li>
    <li> Bought this at a local store figuring what do I have to loose..  Works better than any other product I tried!  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Really works on my ultra sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Initially got it at TJMaxx, but couldn&#x27;t find it again&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this!  I used it for 2 years before my local store stopped carrying it.  We are so dry in Nevada, and Rexalin hydrates without causing breakouts.  I have good skin but very sensitive to too much product.  I was so excited when I saw that Amazon carried Rexaline, I ordered several!</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a Black Friday deal.  I am not sure if it works or not; the perfume used in the cream is so overwhelming that there is no way I could continue to use it.  I rubbed a small amount on the back of my hand and could smell it until the next morning, even after washing my hands.  I don&#x27;t consider myself to be overly sensitive to scent, this one is just too much for me.</li>
    <li> Great face cream!!  Really good for dry, sensitive older skin.</li>
    <li> This is a repurchase since I had nice results the first time around. Does exactly what the name says in hydrating your skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, but I really like it. I&#x27;ve been using Garnier Ultra-Lift, and I definitely prefer Rexaline and will no longer be purchasing the Garnier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, the Rexaline&#x27;s subtle botanical scent is much more pleasant. Although the Garnier worked well, this one is a much better moisturizer. My face also looks younger and feels soft after using Rexaline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but if it continues to impress I will think about purchasing it in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 with fair, freckled skin. I&#x27;ve noticed recently more fine lines popping up, especially when I smile. I&#x27;ve also been spending a lot of time outside now that it&#x27;s warm again, and the sun has been drying me out(especially my forehead) so I&#x27;ve need a serious dose of moisture. Works nicely within a few minutes to minimize fine lines and hydrate. I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks and prefer to use it at night. I felt it had a bit of a greasiness to it that does better soaking in while I sleep. It was too shiny for during the day for me. I also don&#x27;t like the fragrance which is floral to my nose, but that will depend on your taste. On the whole I do really like, though don&#x27;t know if I can personally justify the price tag when I have other more affordable things that work just as well.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for a few weeks now and she is very happy with the product. I do notice the improvement in her skin on the face. Here&#x27;s her review of the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Olay ProX anti-aging lotion/serum for the last two years. The first time I tried it was when we got from Vine and I got hooked on it until Rexaline came along! I have been using Rexaline for the last 2 weeks morning and night (before bedtime) including under eyes. I use just a little for every application and I apply Neutrogena lotion (SPF30) on top of it for morning application. The cream has a very light rose fragrance that I like. I do see a marked difference in the way my skin looks. It does look younger and refreshed. Since it&#x27;s more expensive than Olay ProX, I might just wait few more years to consistently buy and use Rexaline. Overall I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve only been using this product a week it is too soon to&lt;br /&gt;say whether or not in can \\&quot;densify \\&quot; skin as the label promises but it does seem to have a mild plumping effect on my fine lines. It does leave my skin feeling moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll revisit this review in a month to report on any effects I see then.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I&#x27;ve tried creams with hyaluronic acid as a main ingredient before, and never noticed much of an impact. But even within one day of using Rexaline, I could see a big difference in the hydration of my skin--particularly my forehead, which I usually don&#x27;t see much improvement on, no matter what I use. With this, I skipped my serum and still had better results than usual. I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days, and will update this review after another few weeks to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also impressed at the ingredients--no parabens, in particular, unlike most powerful creams. It has a pleasant botanical smell that fades quickly, and absorbs in a few minutes. I&#x27;m usually hard to please with creams, but I would recommend this without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Whenever I try a new skin care product, I anticipate a slight reaction as my skin can be sensitive.  It is not unusual to have a blemish or two arise whenever I switch from one face cream to another.  I did not have that experience this time and was pleasantly surprised.  My husband and I both liked the way it smells and it goes on well, absorbing into the skin without leaving a heavy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the listing clearly states:  creating a plumping effect that minimizes the look of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the ideal candidate for this as I have very fine lines showing in my forehead and I was curious to see if those delicate indications of age would indeed fade.  They did not.  Not even a little.  And for the cost, I can get [[ASIN:B0012J30LY Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, 1.7 Ounce]], which I usually use, for less.  I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would pay $75 for this product and even at the amazon.com bargain price of $37.56 it is simply not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does smell and feel nice.  Unfortunately, I think most women are looking for more, like a fulfillment of the promise made in the product description.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing cream. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. It has a light fragrance. I believe it does help minimize fine lines. Be careful not to get to close to the eyes as it will burn.</li>
    <li> This review is a bit shy of the &#x27;8 weeks&#x27; that the product suggests to see results, but I can say that for the almost three weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it (instead of some other products), I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results. You just need a little bit of this cream to keep your skin moisturized - one pump is good for the face and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy as it&#x27;s absorbed quickly. The cream has a faint, pleasant scent that fades quickly and works well with foundation. I&#x27;m not sure that all my &#x27;fine lines&#x27; will be gone after 8 weeks, especially since I&#x27;m not using the companion product, and you still need something for sunscreen, but this definitely lives up to its &#x27;hydrating&#x27; claim and will last you a good while.</li>
    <li> For double the price, I usually expect twice the performance from a product. Rexaline has a beautiful and expensive-feeling container, a really wonderful scent, but bottom line is that I see no difference using this for 30 days over using my regular [[ASIN:B001E7688Q Neutrogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion, SPF 15, 2.5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]], and the Rexaline also is missing any SPF factor, which I feel is more important than any expensive \\&quot;Hyper-hydrating\\&quot; additive in the fight against premature aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this product, but there&#x27;s also no compelling reason to purchase it over a considerably less expensive drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this in a major cosmetics retail chain.  When it was no longer available, I turned to Amazon and was happy to find it.  I use this as my &#x27;emergency night cream&#x27;; the next morning when I wake, my skin looks (to me) fresher, smoother, less wrinkly and clearer.  To me, it&#x27;s a miracle worker.  I don&#x27;t use it every night, just when I feel I&#x27;ll need that extra boost in the morning and it never fails to deliver.</li>
    <li> I started putting this cream on in the morning and at night before bed and in 2 days of use I notice a definite increase in hydration of my skin.  I used to have those small dry patches on my face but since using this twice a day I have not developed any.  The only problem I have had with this cream is the pump.  It doesn&#x27;t stay primed and it takes 3 or 4 pumps to get enough out to put on my face.  But that is a minor detail that I will live with to have hydrated skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. But you will hate it. No seriously, don&#x27;t buy it. That way there is more for me!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if I like the actual product because I cannot get the pump to work, to get it out of the bottle.  I have pumped it over and over and over again trying to prime it but I only get a tiny spit to come out and I end up beating on the top to get it to come out and nothing works.  I am going to try to contact the seller to see if I am doing it wrong.  But buyer beware.  The bottle does not work well.</li>
    <li> I love the smooth texture of this cream.....its a great moisturizer. I have been using for 3 weeks and have yet to notice any visible results.....but love it as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer and good price! Have tried it before and will continue to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell and texture, not greasy.</li>
    <li> It is good as a moisturizer but not an antiwrinkle cream. Don&#x27;t waste your money unless that is what you want it for..</li>
    <li> The packaging is nice, the smell is nice, the product is very moisturizing...but there is nothing about this product that a drugstore face cream couldn&#x27;t do.  I used nightly and it moisturizes very well...I&#x27;m just not impressed with the price of this product.&lt;br /&gt;***Edit*** to say that I must eat crow!  Now that I have used this for a good 2 months...I have decided I would pay for this product and in fact, I am going to. It works with my skin very well and moisturizes very good...I think my face looks younger.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find any type of face cream that makes much difference when it comes to getting rid of wrinkles and fine lines.  With that being said this is my first time using this product so it will take a little time for me to judge its effects.  So far as face cream goes it seems very nice with a light pleasant scent and seems to be very moisturizing. I&#x27;ll stop back by in 30 days and let you know if I look any younger.  :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about two weeks, and am noticing that my skin does feel more firm.  Since I don&#x27;t have access to whatever tools clinicians use to measure skin hydration or diminution of lines and wrinkles, I can&#x27;t speak to that -- yet.  Time will tell, but the fact that my skin feels different makes me optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy.  It absorbs instantly and leaves no residue.  I don&#x27;t use foundation or powder. Someone who wears makeup might see a different effect.  The scent is so light as to be almost unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost 70 years old, so any product that makes an improvement in my skin -- even if it&#x27;s just the way it feels -- well, that makes me happy.</li>
    <li> My wife is using this product currently. Since the product packaging states 8 weeks for best results, when used in conjunction with another Rexaline product which we don&#x27;t have, I can&#x27;t give a final judgment (Amazon requires reviews within 30 days). I will update this review in another couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her report: very easy to apply and most of all doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feeling, something that cheaper products sometimes do. She likes the applicator bottle design as it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t waste any of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She definitely notices differences in hydration. The product works quite well for that if used twice a day (once a day doesn&#x27;t seem sufficient).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can&#x27;t speak yet to anti-wrinkle properties. It&#x27;s too soon; we&#x27;ll update the review later on to reflect ongoing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good. Definitely a pleasant and easy to use product with clear hydration benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big question: is it worth the price compared to much less expensive \\&quot;generics\\&quot;? Not based on \\&quot;feel\\&quot; and hydration alone. If the anti-wrinkle aspect works out, then \\&quot;maybe\\&quot; as this is a pretty costly cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom to review, and so here she is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I began using this cream about a month ago.  So far, I&#x27;m delighted with the results.  I use it strictly as a night cream, applied about one hour before bedtime and on my wrinkle-prone areas such as under my eyes, forehead, above my lips.  I use it nightly under an overall cream and in the morning, my skin is firm, supple, and hydrated.  The areas where I&#x27;ve used Rexaline are softer and wrinkles are less obvious.  Even my makeup looks better because it goes on smoother and looks more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rexaline is a smooth, buff-colored cream with a nice floral scent that is subtle and it goes on very easily.  The texture is perfect for even application.  I don&#x27;t use much and it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary to do so.  After one month, I&#x27;m about halfway through the bottle so comparatively, the price is not unreasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the pump bottle, though.  It looks great and has a small window along its side to allow the user to see how much is left but before I had reached the halfway point, the pump no longer raised the &#x27;floor&#x27; in the bottle to bring the product up and out, so I would press the pump to no avail.  I asked my son if he could fix it and he did: there is a small hole on the bottom of the bottle and he took a hex screw, inserted it into the hole, so that I can pres the pump while pressing in on the screw and the problem is solved.  I&#x27;m not sure if I got a lemon or if this is a design flaw but I was ready to drive over the bottle to get at the rest of this great night cream!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I am a skeptic when it comes to any products that make promises to turn back the clock and fix wrinkles.  However, Rexaline Hydra-Dose actually does make my skin look younger and plumper.  I was totally surprised that my fine lines did look better after using this product.  My skin looks younger, and feels softer.  I recommend this product.</li>
