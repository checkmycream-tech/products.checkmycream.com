### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Looks great!</li>
      <li>I loved as a polish</li>
      <li>Love this color!</li>
      <li>now I love it as a gel!</li>
      <li>Although it is way browner and greener tinged than that photo, this seller at Beautyland was amazing to deal with.</li>
      <li>The color is kind of a graphite with glitter.</li>
      <li>This was a fabulous color that went with everything I wear very nicely.</li>
      <li>I appreciate a seller who stands by their products, its a great way to run business in a world where people rarely care.</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>Such a great quality product!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always pleased with OPI gelcolor polish.</li>
      <li>I love this color as a polish</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an appealing color at all.</li>
      <li>the color is very transparent but after 3 good coats/UV dries is it brilliantly sparkled, and a very woodsy, mossy ,bark like color.</li>
      <li>I have learned my lesson and now google images of OPI color swatches to see more accurately what I&#x27;m purchasing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Tt did pull back from the edges a bit and is fairly transparent, although it is still a nice fall color.</li>
      <li>It did stay on well despite being see through and really light towards the tips of my nails, just not at all what I was going for.</li>
      <li>Be sure to really shake it before application.  </li>
      <li>The color on their bottles is VERY misleading!!</li>
      <li>This is such a great color, i have it in regular nail polish and suede version, and now i have it in gel!</li>
      <li>It was more of a greenish brown color, not grey at all</li>
      <li>Seller was great, polish is hard to paint.</li>
      <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
      <li>First time buying OPI brand gel polish.  </li>
      <li>so I know already what they are going to look like, but if you are unsure, google first.</li>
      <li>The regular (non gel) version of this color is much more bearable.</li>
      <li>which is why I plan to buy more of their products in the future.</li>
      <li>I wish it had been more grey than mossy brown sparkly</li>
      <li>The color on the bottle is VERY misleading.</li>
      <li>Straight up liquid poop brown.</li>
      <li>OPI should stick to normal polish!</li>
      <li>However, this is more of a brownish/ dark copper type color.</li>
      <li>Very translucent, tends to pull back from tips.</li>
      <li>its more like a gross green.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more grey and less hideous, but still not ANYTHING like the label on the gel polish pretends it is.</li>
      <li>the black is really not black neither grey, not my favorite</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much product would settle and my first application was uneven...</li>
      <li>When my nail girl painted the first layer we were both like, &amp;#34;OMG this is terrible, but maybe it gets better with more coats.&amp;#34; Not the case.</li>
      <li>Not what I expected but pretty just the same.</li>
      <li>This is not a grey...</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see myself wearing it again, but the seller helped me regret my $10 polish purchase a whole lot less.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the original formula of my private jet (a charcoal with holographic glitter), it&#x27;s the new one (a weird grey brown with barely there sparkle).</li>

<li> The color on the handle of the bottle is not indicative of the color it will dry on your nails.</li>
<li> The color is like a shimmery dark gunmetal grey, similar to the color of paint on some cars.</li>
<li> I used at least 3 coats for decent cover.</li>
<li> This product is runny and much harder to work with than Gelish or RedCarpet.  </li>
<li> Lasts longer than other brands I have tried (even during a camping trip).  </li>
<li> Grey green.</li>
<li> It is a dark brown black color.</li>
<li> But its hard buying polishes online.</li>
<li> The color was either not right or something was wrong</li>
<li> Seriously, unless you like baby poop green/brown, this color is not for you.</li>
<li> This polish is thin and runny.</li>
<li> Very hard to explain!</li>
<li> I like the quality of OPI, but I was disappointed in the color.</li>
<li> You almost need a color as a base for it.</li>
<li> The base color underneath the glitter is brown.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m giving this horribly colored polish a 5</li>
<li> Absolutely horrible color</li>
<li> HORRIBLE COLOR!</li>
<li> Of all the gel polishes I have bought, OPI is the worst.</li>
<li> I accidentally ordered two...and they are a TERRIBLE color on your nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I loved as a polish n now I love it as a gel! It&#x27;s easy to apply. If you can paint your nails you can do the color gels!</li>
    <li> NOT the color I was hoping for. But its hard buying polishes online.</li>
    <li> This product is runny and much harder to work with than Gelish or RedCarpet.  The color is kind of a graphite with glitter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always pleased with OPI gelcolor polish. This was a fabulous color that went with everything I wear very nicely. It is a dark brown black color. I used at least 3 coats for decent cover.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible color but maybe I got a defective bottle. It was more of a greenish brown color, not grey at all</li>
    <li> I love the color. I haven&#x27;t put it on yet but that is my goal for the weekend.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE COLOR! Seriously, unless you like baby poop green/brown, this color is not for you. The regular (non gel) version of this color is much more bearable. It&#x27;s more grey and less hideous, but still not ANYTHING like the label on the gel polish pretends it is. The base color underneath the glitter is brown. Straight up liquid poop brown. When my nail girl painted the first layer we were both like, &amp;#34;OMG this is terrible, but maybe it gets better with more coats.&amp;#34; Not the case. Don&#x27;t be fooled. It&#x27;s not an appealing color at all.</li>
    <li> This is such a great color, i have it in regular nail polish and suede version, and now i have it in gel!</li>
    <li> The color is like a shimmery dark gunmetal grey, similar to the color of paint on some cars. Love this color!</li>
    <li> I love this color as a polish and so I decided to buy it as a gelcolor.  Looks great!</li>
    <li> First time buying OPI brand gel polish.  Such a great quality product!  Lasts longer than other brands I have tried (even during a camping trip).  Be sure to really shake it before application.  I didn&#x27;t know how much product would settle and my first application was uneven...totally user error.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this horribly colored polish a 5 and here&#x27;s why. Although it is way browner and greener tinged than that photo, this seller at Beautyland was amazing to deal with. Tt did pull back from the edges a bit and is fairly transparent, although it is still a nice fall color. I wish it had been more grey than mossy brown sparkly but that is an OPI issue, not this seller. I messaged her with my disappointments, and shes sending me a replacement. which is why I plan to buy more of their products in the future. I appreciate a seller who stands by their products, its a great way to run business in a world where people rarely care. the color is very transparent but after 3 good coats/UV dries is it brilliantly sparkled, and a very woodsy, mossy ,bark like color. I can&#x27;t see myself wearing it again, but the seller helped me regret my $10 polish purchase a whole lot less. It did stay on well despite being see through and really light towards the tips of my nails, just not at all what I was going for. I plan to share pictures, bc apparently I&#x27;m not the only one who purchased expecting a grey.</li>
    <li> This polish is thin and runny. Took four coats to build up an acceptable level of color. It&#x27;s not the original formula of my private jet (a charcoal with holographic glitter), it&#x27;s the new one (a weird grey brown with barely there sparkle).</li>
    <li> the black is really not black neither grey, not my favorite</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery! Great product!</li>
    <li> Of all the gel polishes I have bought, OPI is the worst. Save yourself the time and money and go to Sallys and buy either fingerpaints or Orly gel polish. No complaints about the seller! Arrived on time and as described. OPI should stick to normal polish!</li>
    <li> Color sample on bottle looks flat gray.  On hands has a lot do sparkles in it. Not what I expected but pretty just the same.</li>
    <li> this was supposed to be jet gray when it went on my nails it was brown</li>
    <li> The color on the handle of the bottle is not indicative of the color it will dry on your nails. My boyfriend calls it a sparkly brownish/green, I say it&#x27;s an almost-black sparkle. Neither of which I was going for.</li>
    <li> The color was either not right or something was wrong bc the color was a brown and it didn&#x27;t work well at all</li>
    <li> I like the quality of OPI, but I was disappointed in the color. I was hoping for a sparkly granite type color and from the picture and even some of the reviews, I thought that was what I was buying. However, this is more of a brownish/ dark copper type color. Very hard to explain! I have learned my lesson and now google images of OPI color swatches to see more accurately what I&#x27;m purchasing. The color on their bottles is VERY misleading!!</li>
    <li> The color on the bottle is VERY misleading. There are some colors that I&#x27;ve had on before in the regular polish so I know already what they are going to look like, but if you are unsure, google first. I thought I wanted this color until I read the reviews and googled it myself.</li>
    <li> Seller was great, polish is hard to paint. You almost need a color as a base for it. Very translucent, tends to pull back from tips.</li>
    <li> This is not a grey...its more like a gross green. Grey green. I accidentally ordered two...and they are a TERRIBLE color on your nails.</li>
