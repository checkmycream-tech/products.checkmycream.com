      <li>This is my favorite shadow out there.</li>
      <li>Still I love the way it looks and goes on.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more of a peachy color with some shimmer.</li>
      <li>I received this in an Ipsy sample bag, and it&#x27;s my favorite eye shadow ever.</li>
      <li>I love this eye shadow</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so smooth, and silky!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Thank you for developing such a great product, I hope you&#x27;re thinking of developing a blusher or bronzer soon!!</li>
      <li>I LOVE everything about it, the smoothness, shade and shimmer.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this eye shadow.</li>
      <li>That is why I bought more of it.</li>
      <li>That upset me, but the eye shadow itself I love</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s has a cute packaging.</li>
      <li>Lovely shade, and applies like a dream.</li>
      <li>Elizabeth Mott products are becoming my favorite eye makeup brand.  </li>
      <li>This is excellent - all day long and not a crease.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for an eye shadow that does NOT crease - and very important to me, was cruelty free.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very nice accent color, giving my lids a warm glow that looks natural and stays true all day.  </li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this eyeshadow is that it is light, and does not settle into the creases, and wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The texture is wonderful, coverage is solid and easy to achieve, blends well, little to no fallout, excellent wear time.</li>
      <li>It blends well with other shades and products, and time and time again, I am impressed by this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of bright eyepopping color, and this is a great accent shade.</li>
      <li>I love the 3 earthy tones from this range - they are versatile for both work and play because they have just the right amount of shimmer!</li>
      <li>It provides great coverage to my eye, and I love how long it lasts.</li>
      <li>This has quickly become my all time favorite eye shadow.</li>
      <li>goes the shadow because unlike many products out there, it does EVERYTHING it claims to do: it blends and goes on effortlessly, is highly pigmented and lasts ALL DAY with ZERO CREASING!!!</li>
      <li>Shadow seems like it is smooth</li>
      <li>I like the creamy texture and how it just applies on smoothly.</li>
      <li>This eyeshadow goes on velvety smooth, and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I received a sample last year and was so happy to find that I could replenish my supply via Amazon.</li>
      <li>Once I used it once, I loved it, and since then, I&#x27;ve bought several more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s So Big Mascara and the eyeliners - their shadow is consistent with a company that shows it makes a great, quality product and it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
      <li>My new favorite eye shadow!</li>
      <li>Goes on super smooth.</li>
      <li>The mascara is amazing for Florida weather (hot, humid, and HOT).....</li>
      <li>I received this full sized product in one of my Ipsy bags.</li>
      <li>I also like to use this as a highlighter - it&#x27;s about the same color on my fair skin as the Benefit Watts</li>
      <li>Very pretty color</li>
      <li>A pretty, neutral color that&#x27;s also special.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just sparkly enough to look nice without making me feel like I doused my face in glitter.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
      <li>High end product (is silky smooth) for a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed the product with its richness in color, smooth and easy application, and small size for travel.</li>
      <li>My skin tone is pretty close to albino, and my eyes are a really light greenish yellow color.</li>
      <li>Up stick that costs 3x as much.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend pop!</li>
      <li>Would absolutely recommend to others.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for colorful eyeshadows, as they take away from my dramatic eyeliner, so this is the absolute perfect color if you just want to put a little something on to make the look, well, look complete.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Although I usually prefer pearls, satins or mattes, I feel like the finish on this particular shade is a good one to bring luminousness to the eye, especially balanced out by a matte crease color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I live on the beach</li>
      <li>My only complaint about this eyeshadow is that it is so light and glittery that it rarely stays only where I put it.</li>
      <li>I order the Champagne color, which I thought would be a little bit more pink colored but was closer to a soft beige.  </li>
      <li>The shadow is very shimmery, but not in a loose way, like a lot of eye shadows are to attain that look.</li>
      <li>It is closer to a dull peach color, than a light color showing in the picture.</li>
      <li>but the container needs to be a jar not a flat container.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with many eye shadows that creased in the past so it is absolutely relieving to find a product that actually works to address my very concern!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i bought this for my daughter.  We received a sample from ipsy and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this shadow</li>
    <li> This is a must have in my makeup bag- it is just shimmery enough!  It is perfect for both day and night wear.  My favorite thing about this eyeshadow is that it is light, and does not settle into the creases, and wrinkles around my eyes.  (which is a common problem I have with shimmery eye shadow.)</li>
    <li> perfect shimmery shade for me</li>
    <li> I knew what to expect from the color of this shadow because I was replacing a pan of it that I dropped and broke all over the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Champagne is a peachy-pink neutral tone similar in its degree of shimmer (but not its color) to Stila Kitten. It&#x27;s slightly lighter than my natural eyelid color so I like to use it over the lid for a brightening but neutral/ &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toned look. Although I usually prefer pearls, satins or mattes, I feel like the finish on this particular shade is a good one to bring luminousness to the eye, especially balanced out by a matte crease color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is wonderful, coverage is solid and easy to achieve, blends well, little to no fallout, excellent wear time.</li>
    <li> Shadow seems like it is smooth but when I opened the package....the shadow was broken up......it very disappointing and will be asking for a refund ASAP!!!! I contacted the seller and the company was great at customer service as well as replacing my product. Here is what I think now: I think your products are great and your customer service is phenomenal!! I get compliments on my eyeshadow I wear (champagne and antique brass) and mascara (it&#x27;s so Big) and I promote your name and website whenever asked. The mascara is amazing for Florida weather (hot, humid, and HOT)..... I live on the beach and I have been wearing your mascara and eyeliner in the water as well as sand volleyball..... And it doesn&#x27;t smudge or move!!!! Love the product!!! I will be purchasing your products for life!!! Thanks so much!!!</li>
    <li> Lovely shade, and applies like a dream. So happy to have been recommended this great product!</li>
    <li> This has quickly become my all time favorite eye shadow. I received a sample last year and was so happy to find that I could replenish my supply via Amazon. The color is beautiful and stays on all day. I can&#x27;t wait to try her other items.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! There hole line of products are awesome.</li>
    <li> Great eye shadow.  Stays on all day.  My only complaint...it was loose powder not a cake.  I don&#x27;t mind eye shadows that are loose but the container needs to be a jar not a flat container.  Every time I open it, I have to be careful not to spill it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shadow out there. Once I used it once, I loved it, and since then, I&#x27;ve bought several more. It provides great coverage to my eye, and I love how long it lasts. The shadow is very shimmery, but not in a loose way, like a lot of eye shadows are to attain that look. It blends well with other shades and products, and time and time again, I am impressed by this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow. That is why I bought more of it. The only issue I had was both containers of it were all cracked. That upset me, but the eye shadow itself I love</li>
    <li> I got this in one of my ipsy glam bags and fell in love. It&#x27;s the perfect shade. It&#x27;s powder, but goes on so creamy. It&#x27;s shiny but not ostentatiously so. It&#x27;s my go-to eye shadow now.</li>
    <li> looks just like Stila&#x27;s Kitten and it does not crease. looks beautiful on the eyes ! great buy thanks !</li>
    <li> I highly recommend pop! goes the shadow because unlike many products out there, it does EVERYTHING it claims to do: it blends and goes on effortlessly, is highly pigmented and lasts ALL DAY with ZERO CREASING!!! I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with many eye shadows that creased in the past so it is absolutely relieving to find a product that actually works to address my very concern!

Thank you for developing such a great product, I hope you&#x27;re thinking of developing a blusher or bronzer soon!!</li>
    <li> I received this full sized product in one of my Ipsy bags. I&#x27;d never heard of Elizabeth Mott before, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend. Hopefully they expand their product line. This is my favorite neutral shadow, sparkly without looking like a hooker! I also like to use this as a highlighter - it&#x27;s about the same color on my fair skin as the Benefit Watts Up stick that costs 3x as much.</li>
    <li> My new favorite eye shadow! Great amount of shimmer and it&#x27;s has a cute packaging. I like the creamy texture and how it just applies on smoothly. Great product, Elizabeth Mott!</li>
    <li> Great color and not too sparkly. Goes on super smooth.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous product. Love it! Very pretty color, I&#x27;ve already worn it a few times.</li>
    <li> Great color. High end product (is silky smooth) for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is my new best friend!  I LOVE everything about it, the smoothness, shade and shimmer. A lot of times I just wear one eye shadow color and this is the perfect for that because it gives the right amount of pop. Works great for under the eye highlighter as well! I can&#x27;t wait too see what other products they come out with</li>
    <li> This is the best eye shadow I have ever had. Hands down. It&#x27;s so smooth, and silky! It stays put all day, and the color is beautiful! I would call it luminous peach. My skin tone is pretty close to albino, and my eyes are a really light greenish yellow color. This color is the perfect complement for my fair complexion, but I do think it would look great on anyone, and for tanner skin, it would make a great face highlighter.  If you are on the fence, BUY THIS SHADOW!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeshadow I have used!!! It stays on, doesn&#x27;t crease and is a great nude color !!</li>
    <li> Love it! This is a great color and it stays on all day! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this beautiful champagne color. It has great pigmentation and is perfect for a natural daytime look. Also, it can easily be a base for a great smokey eye for nightime. Love it!</li>
    <li> I received this in an Ipsy sample bag, and it&#x27;s my favorite eye shadow ever. A pretty, neutral color that&#x27;s also special. Goes well to work or a party. I love it!</li>
    <li> I order the Champagne color, which I thought would be a little bit more pink colored but was closer to a soft beige.  Still I love the way it looks and goes on.  It&#x27;s a very nice accent color, giving my lids a warm glow that looks natural and stays true all day.  Elizabeth Mott products are becoming my favorite eye makeup brand.  I&#x27;m already a big fan of the It&#x27;s So Big Mascara and the eyeliners - their shadow is consistent with a company that shows it makes a great, quality product and it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I received this product in a beauty box monthly-sample-thing about 6 months ago. I really enjoyed the product with its richness in color, smooth and easy application, and small size for travel. Plus its a color you can wear everyday and also glam up for evening with a little more liner or dark shadow. When I ran out, I knew I&#x27;d need another one, so I purchased it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like velvet and is quite durable standing up to long days at work (retail management, heavy lifting, miles of walking). Would absolutely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye shadow that does NOT crease - and very important to me, was cruelty free.  Hurray!  This is excellent - all day long and not a crease.  Perfect shade that goes with almost everything.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Champagne is a wonderful eyeshadow. It&#x27;s not so off-colored that it appears white on my eyelids... it&#x27;s more of a peachy color with some shimmer. I don&#x27;t really care for colorful eyeshadows, as they take away from my dramatic eyeliner, so this is the absolute perfect color if you just want to put a little something on to make the look, well, look complete. It&#x27;s a great color!</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow</li>
    <li> My only complaint about this eyeshadow is that it is so light and glittery that it rarely stays only where I put it. Within minutes, my glasses and rest of my face have a slight shimmer (the glasses have to be cleaned about an hour after application otherwise it&#x27;s annoying). This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but an unexpected thing.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow goes on velvety smooth, and lasts all day. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of bright eyepopping color, and this is a great accent shade. It&#x27;s just sparkly enough to look nice without making me feel like I doused my face in glitter. Definitely will buy other shades of this brand!</li>
    <li> I did like the color of this product but it came damaged.  I returned the item.</li>
    <li> When the package arrived I opened my pop goes the shawdow and it was broke</li>
    <li> I bought this as the highlighter for my eye area. It is a little darker than I expected from seeing the picture, but I still like it a lot. It is closer to a dull peach color, than a light color showing in the picture. It goes on great and stays! I would buy again and purchase different colors.</li>
