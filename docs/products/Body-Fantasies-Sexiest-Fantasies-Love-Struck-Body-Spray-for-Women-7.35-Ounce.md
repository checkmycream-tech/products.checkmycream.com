    <li> This body spray is wonderful and I appreciate it arriving quickly and in the condition as it was described.  I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells sooo Good! Definitely a VS-Love Spell knock-off. However, this particular spray lasts ALL DAY LONG, especially when layered with lotion. A bit strong. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine wore this all the time and I loved how she alway smelled so sweet but clean and fresh. She told me about this spray and said it was similar to Victoria Secret Love Spell.

This one last longer and I get SO many compliments on it every day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s essentially Victoria Secret&#x27;s \\&quot;Love Smell,\\&quot; just a little more subtle (which isn&#x27;t very). It smells great on some people, but on everyone else, it&#x27;s too much. It&#x27;s a very sweet, and bright smell. It also fades really quick, but with as overpowering of a fragrance as this is, that&#x27;s kind of a good thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 yr old. She started using it about a month ago because a friend of hers used it and gave her a small bottle of it.

I would recommend it.</li>

    <li> I really like this light scent for summer especially.&lt;br /&gt;The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to stick like the older scents do (Vanilla, Cucumber Melon, etc)&lt;br /&gt;Those were on your skin all day, but the Sexiest Fantasies, even though they smell great, just don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;seem to hang on like those other earlier perfumes do/did.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try though - it could just be me.</li>
    <li> has a Simi strong smell of sophistication and fruity flowers, but I feel the sent doesn&#x27;t last long, I found my self re-applying it</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift.  When I received it the bottle had no cap on it, When I contacted the seller he immediately apologized and sent a replacement.
