      <li>and she loved it.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>Love it thanks !!!!!</li>
      <li>Its easy to take on the go!</li>
      <li>Basically, it&#x27;s not the best straightener for being in a hurry, which is a major con for me.  </li>
      <li>This is super cute and the print is great, but it&#x27;s not the greatest flat iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>But if you have a lot of time and you really love Hello Kitty</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed it until a couple months after and the paint started peeling.</li>
      <li>and you really love doing your hair, you should try it out.  </li>
      <li>Works great, got delivered fast, and have had no problems at all with it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cute but the iron doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t heats up</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get to hot, but it does work, and it&#x27;s Hello Kitty, so what more could you ask for? :)</li>
      <li>She was very happy about the flat Hello Kitty style and says it works very well!  </li>
      <li>unless you put huge amounts of hair in, the hair isn&#x27;t even touched by the iron.  </li>
      <li>My sister was with us for Christmas and as soon as the iron was out of the box, she said it was cheaply made and wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>So happy with the color, style, and especially the price.  </li>
      <li>As I don&#x27;t use one, I wasn&#x27;t familiar with brands, types, etc.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>I do however still have the hairdryer several years later, and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my grand-daughters, and they really loved it, Pink, Hello Kitty, is really popular with the young girls these days!</li>
      <li>The irons are a little cheap and don&#x27;t have a good surface for your hair.</li>
      <li>I guess for $40 you can&#x27;t really expect something fabulous, but still...</li>
      <li>My drug store straightener works significantly better as far as functionality goes.  </li>
      <li>But it works just fine and my hair ends up being very soft.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cute and gets super hot, plus it adds a bit of shine to my hair (the way the flat irons are made).</li>
      <li>Does a great job on my daughters thick hair</li>
      <li>Came on time, absolutely adorable but only has four settings!  </li>
      <li>Heats up and gets pretty hit but firs not flatten well.</li>
      <li>She loved it and uses it a few times per week.</li>
      <li>Hello Kitty heats up quickly and nicely, but the whole upper half of the straightener gets hot (really hot)</li>
      <li>Although its outside is fabulously hello kitty</li>
      <li>I bought the straightener along with the matching hair dryer when it first came out at Hot Topic, I ended up returning the straightener two times due to a shortage in the wires.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>The iron does not close completely there fore does not straighten well.</li>
      <li>She uses this with adult supervision and loves her new flat iron.</li>
      <li>I ordered this simply because she&#x27;s 9, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a flat iron for a 9 year old!  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m back to using my old flat iron, because this one&#x27;s just not doin&#x27; it for me.  </li>

    <li> As much as I am in love with Hello Kitty, this straightener hasn&#x27;t impressed me.  My drug store straightener works significantly better as far as functionality goes.  I guess for $40 you can&#x27;t really expect something fabulous, but still...my drug store straightener!!  Hello Kitty heats up quickly and nicely, but the whole upper half of the straightener gets hot (really hot), so it&#x27;s a bit difficult to handle whilst doing your hair.  The biggest pro is that people compliment me on it.  But I&#x27;m back to using my old flat iron, because this one&#x27;s just not doin&#x27; it for me.  It can&#x27;t handle a lot of hair at once, so you&#x27;ve really got to do it in sections if you&#x27;re serious.  Basically, it&#x27;s not the best straightener for being in a hurry, which is a major con for me.  But if you have a lot of time and you really love Hello Kitty and you really love doing your hair, you should try it out.  Bottom line: this straightener boasts appearance instead of functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit as of 4/12/13: I actually just need to apologize... I&#x27;ve finally figured out how to use the straightener and it works great. My hair is also in a bob cut. But it works just fine and my hair ends up being very soft. So, yeah. I basically didn&#x27;t know what I was doing and now I&#x27;ve figured out how to use it. My bad, my bad. I&#x27;m not a straightener expert after all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grand-daughters, and they really loved it, Pink, Hello Kitty, is really popular with the young girls these days!</li>
    <li> Does a great job on my daughters thick hair</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister, whom LOVES Hello Kitty. She loves it! It doesn&#x27;t get to hot, but it does work, and it&#x27;s Hello Kitty, so what more could you ask for? :)</li>
    <li> omg this came in the worst box! it was like taped up to the max! and had another layer of plastic taped around it!!! it was so hard to open i had to cut it all up just to take the straightener out so i can test it!!! and the part of the box that is open so you can see the straightener was taped to the straightener so when i pulled the tape off the hello kitty face peeled off:( :( :( otherwise it does work</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect! It&#x27;s really cute and gets super hot, plus it adds a bit of shine to my hair (the way the flat irons are made). Its easy to take on the go! &amp;#60;3 And it shipped faster that I expected.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is so in to Hello Kitty.  It was great to see so many items available with that theme!  She was very happy about the flat Hello Kitty style and says it works very well!  So happy with the color, style, and especially the price.  This is NOT a &amp;#34;get what you pay for&amp;#34; item!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift. I really enjoyed it until a couple months after and the paint started peeling. This can not be used for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Love it thanks !!!!! A+++++++++++++ Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. I works as advertised and hasn&#x27;t had any problems since she got it.asdfsd asdfasdfsd asdfasdf asdfsadf</li>
    <li> i guess they liked it idk im not a girl. but she does use it a lot since i got it for her</li>
    <li> My younger daughter asked for a hair straightener for Christmas.  As I don&#x27;t use one, I wasn&#x27;t familiar with brands, types, etc.  I ordered this simply because she&#x27;s 9, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a flat iron for a 9 year old!  My sister was with us for Christmas and as soon as the iron was out of the box, she said it was cheaply made and wouldn&#x27;t work.  She was spot-on correct.  The two &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; sides of the barrel don&#x27;t even touch, so unless you put huge amounts of hair in, the hair isn&#x27;t even touched by the iron.  Putting enough hair in to fill the gap, so to speak, results in no results.  The iron also looks bent on one side when held level.  I will be returning this item.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas.  She is constantly on You Tube learning about hairstyles and she had to have a flat iron for her desired hair styles.  She uses this with adult supervision and loves her new flat iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my God Daughter who is 8 and loves Hello Kitty. I was going to purchase this from Target but this was actually about 5.00&#x27;s cheaper than buying it at Target and having to pay for shipping bc I have Amazon Prime. She loved it and uses it a few times per week. I would definitely purchase this again. Perfect for the Hello Kitty fan!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! it works great heats up fast and does a great job on my hair. This is a great product</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy the straightener! I bought the straightener along with the matching hair dryer when it first came out at Hot Topic, I ended up returning the straightener two times due to a shortage in the wires. it&#x27;s not safe and it&#x27;s a waste of your money! I do however still have the hairdryer several years later, and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is super cute and the print is great, but it&#x27;s not the greatest flat iron I&#x27;ve used. The irons are a little cheap and don&#x27;t have a good surface for your hair.

There is not much option for temperature either.</li>
    <li> Although its outside is fabulously hello kitty it does not work well. Heats up and gets pretty hit but firs not flatten well. The iron does not close completely there fore does not straighten well.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter for christmas it&#x27;s cute but the iron doesn&#x27;t work, it doesn&#x27;t heats up so my daughter still uses my flat iron.</li>
    <li> Got this for my son&#x27;s girlfriend for a present and she loved it. Works great, got delivered fast, and have had no problems at all with it.</li>
    <li> Came on time, absolutely adorable but only has four settings!  Otherwise definitely worth it!</li>
