### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>disappears after a while but smells delicious when you put it on.</li>
      <li>The difference in price becomes insignificant when every time you walk into a room, women and men alike notice your wonderful fragrance.</li>
      <li>Great buy and excellent fragrance!!!</li>
      <li>this is close to the skin and will not affend anyone however people will notice this beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>An excellent product at a good price.</li>
      <li>My favorite!!</li>
      <li>The scent is somewhat &amp;#34;muted&amp;#34; but still very nice.  </li>
      <li>no mistake though, for an elegant and nose-catching fragrance this is an excellent addition to any mans collection of fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Dane</li>
      <li>I am always looking for good perfumes/edts for my husband.</li>
      <li>Always buy my colonge from store,bought it for a good price.</li>
      <li>Gets some great views, and quite a bit more on occasion.</li>
      <li>I am love it!</li>
      <li>glad I made the purchase!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing scent that you don&#x27;t smell everyone else wearing.  </li>
      <li>It is nice to have variety though.</li>
      <li>it just smells good, ok?  </li>
      <li>It has a nice musky fragrance for autumn/winter</li>
      <li>Lasts all day had many people tell me this week how they liked it.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly and pricing was good too.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not as strong, but that&#x27;s a good thing, because then you can have more control over how strong you want it to be on your body.  </li>
      <li>I love this scent very good price for such a nice exclusive scent.</li>
      <li>It lasts through the day, but I will say by evening you will probably want to add more if you&#x27;re still planning to be out and about at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Winning at life?</li>
      <li>and I love the bottle.</li>
      <li>If you are debating, and thinking to yourself, how much better than Calvin Klein can this be?</li>
      <li>A sexy scent, along the Polo lines, but a richer, deeper mix of tones to this blend of Ford fragrance...</li>
      <li>it is more on your body than on your shirt.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a sophisticated smell.  </li>
      <li>Not at all overwhelming--</li>
      <li>Ok, there are my 18 words minimum...</li>
      <li>I just wish I could say more about this product.</li>
      <li>Trust me, this is the best and it is really not even close.</li>
      <li>Already I had his Tom Ford for Men and wasn&#x27;t impressed, my sister&#x27;s boss was wearing Tom Ford Extreme</li>
      <li>but most people are unaware of tom ford and just how great his products are.</li>
      <li>The fragrance of high quality, luxurious and good delivery service</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.  </li>
      <li>only wish it didn&#x27;t cost so freaking much, but it&#x27;s worth it if you want to smell good and this will make you smell good.  </li>
      <li>All of the others (Aqua di Gio, Play, Givenchy, Clean For Men, Diesel, etc...)</li>
      <li>Weird, I know, but honestly, this is the best stuff around.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a strong scent, this isn&#x27;t exactly it.  </li>
      <li>The great thing about Extreme is it&#x27;s potency.</li>
      <li>Like this perfume pretty much came on time the seller very professional good deal</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more a woodsy, dare-I-say tobacco but in a good way, masculine, spicy but not Old Spice spicy....</li>
      <li>Let it dry as best as possible before putting your clothes on so</li>
      <li>And then you will smile because they noticed how good you smell but don&#x27;t recognize it as something more common.  </li>
      <li>This smells woodsy yet classy, manly yet sophisticated.</li>
      <li>Very pleasant fragrance and different from my other Tom Ford colognes.  </li>
      <li>I loved the smell of the Tom Ford Black Orchid</li>
      <li>/&gt;Spray onto your body in places that are hot</li>
      <li>Hahahahaha!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be getting another Ford soon ;)</li>
      <li>I have gotten lots of compliments  while wearing this fragrance, and it has reasonable staying power without being overbearing..highly recommended!</li>
      <li>The scent is long wearing and sexy</li>
      <li>It even gets better as the day goes on by allowing the more subtle notes to come out.</li>
      <li>At the beginning it has a strong wooden scent, that becomes milder within 10-15</li>
      <li>I smell leather and fine pipe tobacco when I&#x27;m smelling it mixed with the heat of my body, but I can&#x27;t pick up on the rest that some people say they can smell.</li>
      <li>very versatile</li>
      <li>Then you&#x27;re ready to twerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used 3 different fragrances from Tom Ford, all epic, this one being my favorite.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say what it is that&#x27;s in the scent particularly, but I can certainly tell you that while working on the Las Vegas Strip, inside the casino&#x27;s, talking to nurses in the ER, and patients in the back of the rig certainly tend to lean forward to &amp;</li>
      <li>I dont know if this is the original tom Ford Extreme.</li>
      <li>While one spray in your hot zones can suffice, I spray 3 or 4 times to get my personal smell quota.  </li>
      <li>I use it when I will be outside or in large indoor events.</li>
      <li>This dynamic, spicy and woody fragrance is set far apart from the rest of the Tom Ford range and really equisite.</li>
      <li>These are obviously old.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have the developed nose that some of the reviewers do, so</li>
      <li>Well, don&#x27;t think and hit complete purchase.</li>
      <li>I was worried ordering it without ever having smelled it--and &amp;#34;Extreme&amp;#34; made me a bit nervous, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>and I was surprised.</li>
      <li>This is a mature man&#x27;s scent..</li>
      <li>And then you will feel like all that money you spent was worth it.  </li>
      <li>This is a very intense fragrance, so not much is needed.</li>
      <li>It smells like pure rubbing alcohol after using Extreme by Tom Ford.</li>
      <li>I do, because I googled the shit out of that, and I&#x27;ll tell you right here.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this is likely old batch or faulted somehow because it is definately not as strong and fragrant from the ones purchased at Niemans.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s very classy and makes me want to stay extremely close to him!</li>
<li> I may be one of the few that was hesitant at first to try Tom Ford Extreme.</li>
<li> /&gt;Unfortunately the scent does not last very long as some have already mentioned.</li>
<li> I love some of the other Tom Ford perfumes (Leather/Tobacco etc) but they are fairly expensive and that&#x27;s when after reading some reviews, I settled for this one.</li>
<li> so I picked up Tom Ford Extreme!</li>
<li> And one drop won&#x27;t destroy you like some other colognes would.  </li>
<li> The scent is a little over powering on me.</li>
<li> Now it is an Eau De Toilette (I&#x27;m too lazy</li>
<li> I am not satisfied.</li>
<li> /&gt;So when someone walks past you, and you ask yourself, how do I smell like that guy, start here.</li>
<li> I usually spray once on my chest in the middle where the hair is thickest, and once at the base of my neck where the chest hair begins.</li>
<li> For starters, the smell is quite weak and doesn&#x27;t linger on.</li>
<li> Bad buy for the price.</li>
<li> Very disappointed. ...</li>

    <li> I dont know if this is the original tom Ford Extreme.</li>
    <li> Weird, I know, but honestly, this is the best stuff around. It is manly and it stays around for the ENTIRE day. It even gets better as the day goes on by allowing the more subtle notes to come out. Trust me, this is the best and it is really not even close. I just wish I could say more about this product. I try to get others to try it but most people are unaware of tom ford and just how great his products are. Mr. Ford, send me something please!!</li>
    <li> Great buy and excellent fragrance!!! I am love it!</li>
    <li> This dynamic, spicy and woody fragrance is set far apart from the rest of the Tom Ford range and really equisite.</li>
    <li> I may be one of the few that was hesitant at first to try Tom Ford Extreme. Already I had his Tom Ford for Men and wasn&#x27;t impressed, my sister&#x27;s boss was wearing Tom Ford Extreme and I was surprised. There is only a third of the fragrance left but it isn&#x27;t my number one cologne. It is nice to have variety though.</li>
    <li> the price is around triple any fancy cologne at macy&#x27;s but cheaper in essence.&lt;br /&gt;musky, woody very english in defining masculinity as opposed to french perfumery that is for women&lt;br /&gt;and the italian that don&#x27;t go beyond citrusy.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and pricing was good too. This is a very intense fragrance, so not much is needed. The scent is long wearing and sexy</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a good price. Timely shipping and arrived well packaged to protect the product.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. ...</li>
    <li> Always buy my colonge from store,bought it for a good price.Lasts all day had many people tell me this week how they liked it.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of the Tom Ford Black Orchid I got my wife so I picked up Tom Ford Extreme!</li>
    <li> I switched to the Tom Ford line of cologne several years ago. If you are debating, and thinking to yourself, how much better than Calvin Klein can this be? Well, don&#x27;t think and hit complete purchase. I have used 3 different fragrances from Tom Ford, all epic, this one being my favorite. This smells woodsy yet classy, manly yet sophisticated. After using this for a while, I went back to smell a Calvin Klein fragrance I used to use. It smells like pure rubbing alcohol after using Extreme by Tom Ford. The difference in price becomes insignificant when every time you walk into a room, women and men alike notice your wonderful fragrance. I am complimented every time I wear this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when someone walks past you, and you ask yourself, how do I smell like that guy, start here.</li>
    <li> I love this scent very good price for such a nice exclusive scent. very versatile and I love the bottle. this is close to the skin and will not affend anyone however people will notice this beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> At the beginning it has a strong wooden scent, that becomes milder within 10-15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the scent does not last very long as some have already mentioned. This means that you will probably run out of it quite soon and the price of a bottle  is not low.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a strong scent, this isn&#x27;t exactly it.  The scent is somewhat &amp;#34;muted&amp;#34; but still very nice.  Not at all overwhelming--I was worried ordering it without ever having smelled it--and &amp;#34;Extreme&amp;#34; made me a bit nervous, but I was pleasantly surprised.  My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> This is a mature man&#x27;s scent.. No boys allowed! I have gotten lots of compliments  while wearing this fragrance, and it has reasonable staying power without being overbearing..highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I discovered this as a sample in a Sephora sample pack.  All of the others (Aqua di Gio, Play, Givenchy, Clean For Men, Diesel, etc...) smelled sort of the same but this one is different from the pack... it&#x27;s more a woodsy, dare-I-say tobacco but in a good way, masculine, spicy but not Old Spice spicy.... it just smells good, ok?  It&#x27;s also a sophisticated smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.  Now it is an Eau De Toilette (I&#x27;m too lazy to spell-check that one) so it&#x27;s not as strong, but that&#x27;s a good thing, because then you can have more control over how strong you want it to be on your body.  And one drop won&#x27;t destroy you like some other colognes would.  While one spray in your hot zones can suffice, I spray 3 or 4 times to get my personal smell quota.  It lasts through the day, but I will say by evening you will probably want to add more if you&#x27;re still planning to be out and about at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know the rules of proper cologne application?  I do, because I googled the shit out of that, and I&#x27;ll tell you right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray onto your body in places that are hot BUT ONCE YOU SPRAY DON&#x27;T YOU DARE RUB IT!  This will interfere with the curing of the cologne the way it&#x27;s supposed to.  Let it dry as best as possible before putting your clothes on so it is more on your body than on your shirt.  Then you&#x27;re ready to twerk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it didn&#x27;t cost so freaking much, but it&#x27;s worth it if you want to smell good and this will make you smell good.  It will also make people ask, \\&quot;What IS that?\\&quot; and start sniffing on you in a flirtatious way because you just gave them a reason to, you player!  And then you will smile because they noticed how good you smell but don&#x27;t recognize it as something more common.  And then you will feel like all that money you spent was worth it.  Snap!</li>
    <li> The scent is a little over powering on me. Use it sparingly, but it lasts all day. I use it when I will be outside or in large indoor events.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant fragrance and different from my other Tom Ford colognes.  Would definitely buy again when it is time for a refill.</li>
    <li> These are obviously old. The great thing about Extreme is it&#x27;s potency. Unfortunately, this is likely old batch or faulted somehow because it is definately not as strong and fragrant from the ones purchased at Niemans.</li>
    <li> Smell like $100 bill each time you wear this.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas. I have never smelled it before as he just wanted ANY Tom Ford cologne. It has a nice musky fragrance for autumn/winter but I don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s a bit pricey and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger...disappears after a while but smells delicious when you put it on.</li>
    <li> Tom Ford&#x27;s Extreme is LUCIOUS, I get lots of compliments but only early in the day.  It seems to have a short &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; on my body.  Maybe I should have gotten 2 of them.  One in the morning and one at work for a &amp;#34;booster shot.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake though, for an elegant and nose-catching fragrance this is an excellent addition to any mans collection of fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Dane</li>
    <li> What can I say. Two sprays of this and the girlfriend started clawing at my chest. Scratch marks? Check. Winning at life? Check! Hahahahaha! A+ will buy again.</li>
    <li> My favorite!! Suggest all males try a sample at your local &#x27;upscale&#x27; men&#x27;s fragrance counter... you might just like it and I know she will! Ok, there are my 18 words minimum...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for about 7 years now. I work as a paramedic, and wear it during work. I usually spray once on my chest in the middle where the hair is thickest, and once at the base of my neck where the chest hair begins. It lasts all through a 12 hour shift, and definitely changes during that time. I don&#x27;t have the developed nose that some of the reviewers do, so I can&#x27;t say what it is that&#x27;s in the scent particularly, but I can certainly tell you that while working on the Las Vegas Strip, inside the casino&#x27;s, talking to nurses in the ER, and patients in the back of the rig certainly tend to lean forward to &amp;#34;really pay attention&amp;#34; to what it is you&#x27;re saying when you&#x27;re wearing this. Gets some great views, and quite a bit more on occasion. I smell leather and fine pipe tobacco when I&#x27;m smelling it mixed with the heat of my body, but I can&#x27;t pick up on the rest that some people say they can smell.</li>
    <li> I am always looking for good perfumes/edts for my husband. I love some of the other Tom Ford perfumes (Leather/Tobacco etc) but they are fairly expensive and that&#x27;s when after reading some reviews, I settled for this one. I am not satisfied. For starters, the smell is quite weak and doesn&#x27;t linger on. An hour or two is what I can smell it for. After which it is replaced by a powdery smell that some low end perfumes/ deodorants have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have it in my collection but don&#x27;t end up using it. Bad buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Once u pop... you cant stop they say. So once i started buying this, i couldn&#x27;t stop. I&#x27;m ordering my third this week</li>
    <li> A sexy scent, along the Polo lines, but a richer, deeper mix of tones to this blend of Ford fragrance...glad I made the purchase! I&#x27;ll be getting another Ford soon ;)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing scent that you don&#x27;t smell everyone else wearing.  I recommend it!!</li>
    <li> The fragrance of high quality, luxurious and good delivery service</li>
    <li> TOO PRICY !!!!!  If I knew now what I didn&#x27;t know then I would never have purchased this product.  Over rated</li>
    <li> Like this perfume pretty much came on time the seller very professional good deal</li>
    <li> My fiancé wears this cologne well. I can&#x27;t get enough. It&#x27;s very classy and makes me want to stay extremely close to him!</li>
