<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have never used fibers before to thicken my lashes as I have used regular mascaras to obtain that effect. I decided to buy this product and I am so happy that I did. I got compliments that my mascara and eyelashes were full and different than usual. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Wow! This works GREAT. Love how it makes my lashes look. Also doesn&#x27;t flake like other fiber mascara.</li>
    <li> These ladies are pretty cool but they do clp so you need a lady brush. Also they smear</li>
    <li> The fibers easily get in your eyes and was irritating.</li>
    <li> It really makes your lashed long and thick but it does flake little fibers on your cheeks during the day.</li>
    <li> This is the best fiber mascara that I have tried so far. I have worn several different kinds of fiber lash mascara and with the Catzeyes I have been able to wear this mascara all day without any fibers falling out. Im very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I first applied this fiber mascara this past Sunday (Mother&#x27;s Day) and I absolutely love it...Im so grateful to have a product that substitute me from applying false lashes all the time. I don&#x27;t have very long eyelashes so this product come in to great usage for me. I will purchase this product with my own money as soon as I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION AS WELL!</li>
    <li> Very very disappointed in this product.  I read the many reviews before purchasing this product.  The mascara completely clumped on lashes.  Awkwardly, I went ahead and put on the fibers.  They did not add any length, just more clumping.  I looked like i had spiders on my eyes.  Not attractive at all.  I will return this product.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I tried the CatZeyes Fiber Lash and LOVE IT!! I have short and thin lashes, but look like I&#x27;ve got good lashes today because of this product. I would recommend it to anyone, even if your lashes are decent. They&#x27;ll be better with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using fiber lash mascara for awhile and this works just like the other brands I have tried. Fiber lash mascara is the best cosmetic invention in some time. At the end of the day, it is easily removed with any facial or eye cleanser. You will love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product makes my eyelashes look long  , doesn&#x27;t glob or make a mess.</li>
    <li> Love my fiber lashes!!!! See the difference! And that&#x27;s one coat!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay..... I used it for 2 months.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again. Not that it was bad, it just wasn&#x27;t all that it was bragged to be.  I didn&#x27;t like that no matter how careful I was, the little fibers always ended up on my cheeks.  It did, however, last through my workout, which I liked.  But if one drop of water or sweat gets near your lashes, this stuff is off faster than you can say rain.</li>
    <li> pretty good, comparable to yonnique!</li>
    <li> Received the mascara in a very nice box.  I have very short lashes it is amazing how long and thick they look after I apply it. I&#x27;m in love. The mascara is easy to apply does not run and even just as easy to remove. I now know this is my go to mascara. Finally at my age I found mascara that I like. I received this mascara at a reduce rate for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I have only used it a few times so far but it is incredible.  The results you get are amazing.  Lashes are long and think, does not clump at all.  Look forward to continued use!!</li>
    <li> Clumps don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> The fiber bottle was completely empty..</li>
    <li> This has been a very fun product to use- I honestly didn&#x27;t realize what the package deal was- mascara and the fiber brush.  Definitely makes a big difference on my eyes and I&#x27;m really enjoying getting dolled up without the pricetag of lash extensions!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  You can totally see a huge difference. I will be posting pics shortly, it&#x27;s much easier than I thought it would be too apply as well.  Doesn&#x27;t smear or end up under your eyes (even when you forget to take it off at night, woops!)  I did notice if I apply early around 10am - i do need another application around 5 if I plan on going out for the night, but its not a problem.  Would definitely reocmmend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have long lashes to begin with and always want them longer. This goes on easily an comes off easily. I wear contacts and didn&#x27;t bother me one bit!</li>
    <li> Great Mascara!  Doesn&#x27;t clump and looks fabulous!</li>
    <li> I like as much if not more than the brand that is double the price.</li>
    <li> I got this at a great discount for a review. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I got this today and just had to try it right away. Let me start by saying I feel naked without mascara. I&#x27;ve heard of fiber mascara before and thought about trying it. I&#x27;m sure glad I did! I love this product. I normally put on 2-3 coats of decent mascara and am somewhat satisfied. This stuff required one coat and built up my lashes much better than my go to mascara. I will certainly be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Best eyelash fiber product I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> Was excited to try the mascara since there were so many positive reviews. The mascara was good, but the fiber material made my eyes itch. There must be a recommendation for removing the product included since it took several attempts to take the product off. I would like to return it as I don&#x27;t think I will use it again.</li>
    <li> Omg ! I&#x27;m in love ☺️ wore for two days now n I will never buy plain mascara again this stuff is awesome will definitely purchase again very satisfied!</li>
    <li> So glad I don&#x27;t have to apply my lashes everyday. This gives me the length I need.</li>
    <li> As a busy woman in her 30s I look for easy and effective make-up tools and techniques. I had not heard of fiber mascara so was curious to receive this as a gift. It&#x27;s very easy to apply - a layer of mascara, then a layer of the dry fiber, followed by a final mascara layer. I think you can keep layering for even thicker lashes but I&#x27;ve not needed to do this. Lasts all day and opens up my eyes for a more youthful look without the fuss of false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two brushes come in a hard case that includes a mirror. Very useful for packing in my gym bag to apply after showering at the gym. Some lip gloss on my lips and I&#x27;m ready to go out!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I:ve tried to find, so I LOVE the product.  Will continue to use..  THE COLOR IS PERFECT. APPLIES EASILY. HOWEVER, I CAN&#x27;T GET THE BASE TUBE TO WORK FOR ME......AND THE BASE TUBE DOESN&#x27;T HAVE MUCH IN IT. I LIKE IT VERY MUCH.</li>
    <li> I have never used fiber lashes before so I had no clue what to expect.  It&#x27;s quite amazing!  My lashes looked soooo full!  And long!  And you can keep applying over and over and they just get thicker and longer!  Check out the pictures, one side is done one side is not.  Pretty incredible.  This is after just two coats.  The third picture I put my normal mascara on which takes several coats of several different types and still doesn&#x27;t add length to them.  I received this item at a discount for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Holy. Cow.  Where has fiber lash mascara been all my life?  I was a little hesitant at first about it being 2 products that need to be applied, one after the other.  I am used to curling my lashes, then applying 1 coat of mascara and having to separate the lashes.  Let me tell you: there is NO need to curl your lashes when using this product, and it takes less than a minute to apply it all.  The mascara goes on smoothly and gets each lash the first time around.  The fibers make my lashes longer and fuller immediately, and in my pictures below you can see the difference between no mascara and this product. What a difference!  I am totally SOLD and am excited to keep using this product!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and I am a daily user of it. If u get clumps what I have done is put some other mascara on bottom I use covergirl then I apply the mascara then a few swipes of the fibers over my whole lashes, then apply mascara then do just the tips of my lashes til I get the length I am happy with. After that I use the color eye enhancer to help if I get any clumps. Like I said I love this mascara!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Longer lashes. Easy clean up when you make a mistake</li>
    <li> I love the mascara but I don&#x27;t love the fiber that you are supposed to apply after. The little fibers got everywhere including in my eye.  I wound up throwing the fiber away. I will continue to use the actual mascara though.</li>
    <li> not worth the price-seemed like there was hardly anything in the mascara bottle</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and made my lashes longer and darker and thicker. I didn&#x27;t have to use fake eyelashes</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I usually just use the mascara without the fiber. Although for the dramatic look the fiber is great!</li>
    <li> The only issue I had is even after being super  careful &amp; following the steps, i kept getting fibers in my eyes which is very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have had nice results with the mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this! Used it this morning for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use and it looks great! Made my tired eyes look young and full again! Will use this every time I use mascara from now on!</li>
    <li> I love this Mascara. I can throw away my fake eyelashes. :)</li>
    <li> I cant believe how long and luxurious my lashes are after using this product, Makes my eyes look so pretty. I have had 2 compliments in 5 hours from people saying how beautiful my eyes look. Wish I had this before. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> The application of the 3D fiber lash mascara is very simple and easy. If you properly apply the mascara then you will have no fibers dropping on your face, no smearing and no eye irritation. I put it on at 7am and washed it off at 8pm. My eyes looked just as freshly done as when I did it at 7am.</li>
    <li> Really nice packaging, can be a great gift for mothers day girlfriends birthday etc. The mascara itself is individually sealed, so if you do not want to open it and use it immediately, it wont dry out right away. I have very short and straight eyelashes, and mascara is a must have for my everyday routine makeup. I like this fiber type of mascara, with a couple of coats, lashes look longer and fuller. Easy to take off with eye makeup remover or just warm water with cleanser. Great purchase, amazing quality.</li>
    <li> First time trying this produce... I&#x27;m a fan. It does make your lashes look drastically fuller.</li>
    <li> OBSESSED this with mascara! The lengthening fibers are insanely awesome!</li>
    <li> i dont think i could use this product every day as the little fibers do get in my eyes and are impossible to get out. But the look you get once applied is nice.</li>
    <li> This is a great fiber mascara</li>
    <li> I may need to get used to this more. It looks good, but the fibers can irritate my eyes and fall below my eyes so I have to make sure to wipe underneath my eyes throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have short, light colored lashes and have found this product to work very well for me.  I see a lot of people who have issues with application or confusion about the fibers.  Hopefully my review will help with that.&lt;br /&gt;You will get 2 tubes, one is mascara and one is fibers. The fibers are dry and loose, the mascara is just like any typical mascara.  I suggest applying this before doing all of your make up,  if that&#x27;s not an option I would then suggest getting a piece of tissue and laying it under your eye to catch loose fibers that fall during application.&lt;br /&gt;Apply the mascara to both eyes and allow to dry.  Then one eye at a time,  apply mascara again and while it&#x27;s still wet get your fibers.  Slowly pull the wand out of the tube,  tap the wand to get any loose fibers to fall off.  Gently tap the fibers onto the tips of your lashes.  Don&#x27;t stroke them on like you do the mascara, if you do that,  the fibers will fall into your eyes. Repeat if necessary,  just put the mascara over the fibers you just applied and add more fibers.  The more you do it,  the more dramatic it will look.  If you haven&#x27;t done your makeup yet,  you can wipe away any fibers that have fallen on your cheeks or under your eyes.  If your makeup is done,  use the tissue to catch those falling fibers because they are not easy to remove without messing up your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest playing with the lashes and seeing what works best for you BEFORE you intend to wear it out so that you can get used to the application process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional discount to purchase, test and review this mascara.</li>
