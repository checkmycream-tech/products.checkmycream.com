      <li>I have very fine and dry hair and my hair</li>
      <li>Hair feels so much healthier &amp; seems to grow faster when using this stuff.  </li>
      <li>; because my&lt;br /&gt;hair is also very fine.&lt;br</li>

      <li>is so soft after using this!</li>
      <li>I heard a bunch of things about this product and had used it for a short time in the past amd liked it, so I decided to try it again.</li>
      <li>I had only gotten in to the top of my collar bones, which is only half as fast as my hair normally grows.</li>
      <li>Only issue I had was that I would have to use another conditioner after this one because this set makes my hair feel super dry, even in the shower.</li>
      <li>Same large and all same.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been using this product again and the Macadamia Oil Natural Deep Repair Masque I also purchased from Amazon, for only about 4 weeks.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t think I would say it makes my hair grow any quicker as in some reviews I&#x27;ve read or seen on other sites because it&#x27;s a natural process to let it grow, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product for anyone trying to grow their hair long (mine used to be down to my knees).</li>
<li> I will try other pumps from other bottles for use in the shower with my new Mane &#x27;n Tail Shampoo and Conditioner.    </li>
<li> Then about a month or so ago my hairstylist suggested it (I&#x27;m growing my hair long again).  </li>
<li> A year and a half ago, I had to shave my head for medical reasons, and ever since then I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it back out noce and long!</li>
<li> I will continue using this, even after my hair gets as long as I want it!</li>
<li> i brought this to make my hair grow long and it has work!</li>
<li> hair is quite dry</li>
<li> I&#x27;m partial to John Frieda products and have a lifetime supply of those</li>
<li> not what i expected.</li>
<li> Just as any other shampoo and conditioner, this pair does its job.</li>
<li> omg it sucks..</li>
<li> i have thick hair</li>
<li> wasted 25 dollars over this product!!!</li>
<li> will use it as it isn&#x27;t bad--</li>

    <li> Great product!  Fast Delivery!</li>
    <li> i always see this in the dog isle at stores, but figured I would give it a try for myself. Just as any other shampoo and conditioner, this pair does its job. I don&#x27;t think I would say it makes my hair grow any quicker as in some reviews I&#x27;ve read or seen on other sites because it&#x27;s a natural process to let it grow, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Only issue I had was that I would have to use another conditioner after this one because this set makes my hair feel super dry, even in the shower.</li>
    <li> omg it sucks.. not what i expected. wasted 25 dollars over this product!!!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner I have ever used!  Hair feels so much healthier &amp; seems to grow faster when using this stuff.  Nice smell also!</li>
    <li> My teenagers swear this makes their hair grow faster....it smells nice....price is decent for the amount you are getting.</li>
    <li> First bought this product around 40 years ago in a local pharmacy, but then I didn&#x27;t see it anymore.  Then about a month or so ago my hairstylist suggested it (I&#x27;m growing my hair long again).  I was flaberghasted - I didn&#x27;t think the shampoo existed anymore!  I&#x27;m very happy to have found it again.  I highly recommend this product for anyone trying to grow their hair long (mine used to be down to my knees).</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product! I have very fine and dry hair and my hair is so soft after using this! I live the light, fresh scent and my hair has even started to grow a bit! This is the best shampoo and conditioner on the market!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo my hair feels super healthy and looks shiny and beats expensive shampoo results&lt;br /&gt;So glad I tried it</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of the hair when done</li>
    <li> I love it..&lt;br /&gt;My favorite shampoo and conditioner ever.&lt;br /&gt;It is highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I will get another one soon. :)</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t too heavy and leaves a fresh scent as well as clean hair.  I actually use it for my dog as well and works equally as well!</li>
    <li> This package came packed REALLY well, and it came sooner than I thought! Great experience......thanks so much!!!!</li>
    <li> The product is well priced--I will say that.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it as it isn&#x27;t bad--but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great either--for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is quite dry and I need a richer condition that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;too rich&amp;#34; because my&lt;br /&gt;hair is also very fine.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s any better than others but I will use up both 32 oz. Shampoo and Conditioner - eventually.  I&#x27;m partial to John Frieda products and have a lifetime supply of those but I like these as well.  I do wish they had a pump dispenser on top as convenient as the Mane &#x27;n Tail Hoofmaker Lotion which I enjoy because of the ease of use.  I will try other pumps from other bottles for use in the shower with my new Mane &#x27;n Tail Shampoo and Conditioner.    UPDATE January 16, 2015:  I have been advised by Straight Arrow Products company spokesperson that others have reportedly used pumps for syrup bottles from restaurant supply companies.  For me it&#x27;s worth checking out and I was pleased that they responded to my inquiry so quickly.</li>
    <li> I saw this in Safeway today. Buy one get one free. Each one only spend $5.99. Same large and all same.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I got mine at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for $6 each, but it is the same thing! This product has made my hair fall out less, be more healthy in general, and it really has helped my hair grow more quickly! My hair grows about 1 1/2 inches each month!</li>
    <li> My son loves this product.</li>
    <li> Really great, helps improve my hair condition.</li>
    <li> Hair feel smooth and soft after using this product. I woould buy it again. Good price too</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and great products!</li>
    <li> A year and a half ago, I had to shave my head for medical reasons, and ever since then I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it back out noce and long! I had only gotten in to the top of my collar bones, which is only half as fast as my hair normally grows. I heard a bunch of things about this product and had used it for a short time in the past amd liked it, so I decided to try it again. I&#x27;m glad I did! My hair has grown to the bottom of my collar bones and I&#x27;ve been using this product again and the Macadamia Oil Natural Deep Repair Masque I also purchased from Amazon, for only about 4 weeks. Everyone is telling me &amp;#34;your hair is growing so fast!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;your hair is so healthy!&amp;#34; which makes me very happy, because I&#x27;ve always wanted hair as healthy as mine for a LONG time. I will continue using this, even after my hair gets as long as I want it!</li>
    <li> i love main and tail shampoo and conditioner! it works amazing! i brought this to make my hair grow long and it has work! and it has made my hair very healthy looking and smooth. it is worth ever pennie! i have got my main and tail at walgreens for 8$ each and it was the 32oz. i have herd u can get it at The Dollar Tree Store for like 4$ i believe, and its only the 12oz. i have thick hair and i have had the 32oz for about 1 month and i still have most of it left so, it does come with alot of product! i am going to repurchase this product any time soon!!!!</li>
