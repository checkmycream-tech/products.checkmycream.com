      <li>Just use it as suggested &amp; be sure to keep thorough track for a full refund, should it not work.</li>
      <li>One of the reviews I read before purchasing this called it a &amp;#34;glorified heating pad&amp;#34; which, based on my three weeks of experience, seems fairly accurate.  </li>
      <li>Light Relief System</li>
      <li>The oval shape of the hand held device was comfortable for application to joints, even feet.</li>
      <li>I think this is my fifth Light Relief.  </li>
      <li>All my relatives have pain relief with light therapy unit.</li>
      <li>Like the light system.</li>
      <li>After using it for 30 minutes that pain as greatly subsided for several hours without having to take anything for it.  </li>
      <li>feel comfortable recommending this product.</li>
      <li>The light relief had helped to get rid of the pain.  </li>
      <li>this is a fantastic product.  </li>
      <li>Comfortable pad(s).  </li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t go a day without using the Light Relief.  </li>
      <li>Works best to loosen stiff muscles that were sprained or otherwise damaged.</li>
      <li>There is still tenderness and I will need the surgery eventually, but for now, I am able to enjoy the summer without being in so much pain.</li>
      <li>At 61 I have more aches than I used to and this really helps.</li>
      <li>Not to sure if it really works for my pains yet</li>
      <li>This is a great deal because you get the extra large body pad with it.</li>
      <li>Once I&#x27;m settled &amp; find a good chiro and/or acupuncturist (both have helped me in the past with a whole host of issues, once a good one is found), I&#x27;ll supplement with those treatments, but I&#x27;m amazed that this has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THE LIGHT RELIEF SYSTEM WAS NOT AT ALL EFFECTIVE FOR THE DEEP HIP AND THIGH PAIN</li>
      <li>so i was lucky in 30 days return</li>
      <li>pretty colored light display to hide the fact that machine is not helping pain level.</li>
      <li>This one gets the most use, by far!  </li>
      <li>; he sells super quality 2x more light for almost same price</li>
      <li>I will need surgery but in the meantime Light Relief helps much.</li>
      <li>The unit is not as powerful as some I have used</li>
      <li>After three good uses it has developed an electrical malfunction that feels like a short and burn.</li>
      <li>I had to call Light Relief directly.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Even the back of the neck was able to be covered by the pad.</li>
      <li>back is better, since using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking you will be able to find out the entire charges at the end of the order process, it&#x27;s Way</li>
      <li>My daughter in law borrowed my first one and it never made it home.</li>
      <li>It worked the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>Even if it is for a couple hours, when there is no other relief available.</li>
      <li>I have worn the first one out from using it so much.</li>
      <li>Sporatic use is much less effective.</li>
      <li>After 2 months the large pad stopped working.  </li>
      <li>The Large body Pad does not work.  </li>
      <li>and you have already been charged before you find out that theirs does not come with the AC Adapter or the large body pad.  </li>
      <li>If I had purchased the device without the large pad</li>
      <li>LED on both the large pad and the hand held device.  </li>
      <li>This is the second Light Relief I have purchased.  </li>
      <li>Stopping siatic pain very well wife has copd she put it on her chest doctor</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and was packaged very well.</li>
      <li>This newer one has a rectangular light pad that covers a larger area.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for ease of use &amp; well made rugged design!</li>
      <li>She really likes it and says it helps her a lot.</li>
      <li>It has not helped my arthritic wrist much, but</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s myalgias and arthalgias improved with the system.Her pain gradually improved. I recommend the system We are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I got a variety of IR red/blue lights systems to see which I liked.  This one gets the most use, by far!  Easy controls.  Comfortable pad(s).  Seems to help joints and muscles a bit, but not a complete miracle.  Works best to loosen stiff muscles that were sprained or otherwise damaged.</li>
    <li> not sure too early to tell.</li>
    <li> Using it for my knee.  The extra large body pad &amp;#34;kind of&amp;#34; wraps around my knee.  I usually use a rubber band to hold it in place.  However, that&#x27;s no big deal.  I&#x27;ve used this twice a day, for about a month now, and I am noticing that my knee is not so stiff and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; so much as it was before.  I seem to be able to walk &amp;#34;normally&amp;#34; most of the day.  However, by evening, when I&#x27;m tired and have been on my feet a lot during the day, the hurting returns.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> this is my fourth system......they are Christmas gifts for relatives with back pain...works for me</li>
    <li> I use this for my back and for my torn rotary cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used heating pads and it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light Relief System is the most wonderful thing there is.</li>
    <li> Great product, reasonably priced</li>
    <li> It works great right off the bat.  It is easy to apply to the many places that I need relief of pain caused by a Surgery I had 4-4-2013.  I already recommended Light Relief to my older sister that is having pain in her spine due to arthritis and joint pain.</li>
    <li> Both my fiancée and I use this device to assist with sports related issues and so far it has relieved pain and issues about 80% of the time.</li>
    <li> I have had pain in my lower back and head/neck.  The light relief had helped to get rid of the pain.  The extra large body pad is needed for the back.</li>
    <li> This is the second Light Relief I have purchased.  I bought the first one through the company&#x27;s website for my mother who has had rotary cuff surgery on her arm multiple times.  She doesn&#x27;t go a day without using the Light Relief.  I bought the second one for my boyfriend who has degeneritive bone disease.  I use the boyfriend&#x27;s on occasion for my arthritis pain.  Buying the second unit through Amazon meant that I didn&#x27;t have to put up with a sales person trying to get me to upgrade my order.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve been using it on my knees and feet every night. Seems to work no better than any heating pad out there. Works good in that aspect but not a miracle worker like in the commercials on TV.  I&#x60;ll never trust Him again either Natalie!!!</li>
    <li> This product works for me. Relief from aches and pains. At 61 I have more aches than I used to and this really helps.</li>
    <li> I think this is my fifth Light Relief.  I have sever back pain and this has given me excellent help with my pain.</li>
    <li> Okay, at the risk of sounding off-kilter &amp; woo-woo, this thing works. I&#x27;ve used it on a chronic neck/shoulder muscle/nerve problem with intense stiffness &amp; PAIN. A chiropractor said it was thoracic outlet syndrome... basically pinched nerves between the 1st rib &amp; collarbone, which was severe enough that my arm/hand was weak &amp; I couldn&#x27;t hold a cup in my left hand, I couldn&#x27;t turn my head to the left without a verbal outburst &amp; I had tingling &amp; pins &amp; needles all through my arms &amp; into all fingers on both sides. When it began affecting my sleep severely &amp; I began swallowing Ibuprofin like they were candy, I knew I needed other treatment than what I&#x27;d already tried. This has been a 5-yr problem (initially a packing/moving injury) &amp; flares up if moving heavy things or a long period of repetitive, unnatural motion, like packing belongings, which I did for a recent move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 5-yrs, 6 chiropractors made little to no progress &amp; at times, made me feel worse. I didn&#x27;t see a dr (that was a last resort) as at times it would go away for months, until I lifted something again &amp; I don&#x27;t want pills or surgery, which is what the chrio said would happen. PT exercises exacerbated pain. Ice helped when on the injury, but that&#x27;s just a temp fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I searched for other solutions &amp; bought the machine. Used twice/day for 15-min (according to directions), within 1-mo, it&#x27;s 75% better. Just recently, I stopped using it for 1-wk &amp; I noticed it&#x27;s flaring a bit, so I&#x27;m back to twice/day. Once I&#x27;m settled &amp; find a good chiro and/or acupuncturist (both have helped me in the past with a whole host of issues, once a good one is found), I&#x27;ll supplement with those treatments, but I&#x27;m amazed that this has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my 83-yr old mother has had troubled feet &amp; legs since her late 20s &amp; it now affects her walking. She has varicose veins &amp; very twisted up toes/bunions, cannot feel her feet at times &amp; needed surgery decades ago, but opted not to... probably not a good idea in the long run. In any event, I urged her to use it... she balked for days &amp; thought it was silly, then thought she&#x27;d give it a try one particularly painful day &amp; lo &amp; behold, with decades of pain &amp; discomfort, she said that after 1 day, she can stand &amp; walk without wobbling &amp; she can move her toes. She hasn&#x27;t yet had pain relief in the month she&#x27;s been using it, but she&#x27;s also not consistent &amp; will go for days without using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recognizing that different things work for different people, if you&#x27;ve got a chronic problem &amp; wish to try a non-invasive treatment, I really do hope this will work for you. It&#x27;s pricey, but there is a return policy... I believe 30-days from the date of receipt. Just use it as suggested &amp; be sure to keep thorough track for a full refund, should it not work.

    <li> Seller needs to specify the number of red LED, number of Blue LED, number of non lighted (infrared emitting) LED on both the large pad and the hand held device.  Also, the maker should develope show how many of the infrared emitting LED are functional. After all, that is where the &#x27;money is&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Great service!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I tried it for my shoulder and knee arthritis for the recommended two weeks, and I could not really tell any difference in my pain level. The heat felt OK, but not as good as a moist heating pad.</li>
    <li> the only thing I did not like is it kickes off after 15 minutes, otherwise it is great.would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This came broken.  I never could get the lights to come on.  The way the packaging came, it looked like it had been returned once already.  I should have known that it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Followed directions. After three good uses it has developed an electrical malfunction that feels like a short and burn. Will be returning. May just be a fluke. It worked well before the failure.</li>
    <li> Amazon is the only place I would recommend buying this product.  If you go directly to lightrelief.com their site is HORRIBLE and you think you are getting the same package until it&#x27;s too late and you have already been charged before you find out that theirs does not come with the AC Adapter or the large body pad.  Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking you will be able to find out the entire charges at the end of the order process, it&#x27;s Way Too Late by then.  Also reading all feedback on the LightRelief Company Customer Service will lead you to believe that all they really want to do is charge you shipping charges for any type of problem that you have with their products.  This is a shame that a pretty good product that helps with some people&#x27;s pain is so poorly supported by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This my second Relief light. My daughter in law borrowed my first one and it never made it home. It relieved her pain. This newer one has a rectangular light pad that covers a larger area. I love it. It helps relieve the pain in my knee. I will need surgery but in the meantime Light Relief helps much.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with my thumbs that only surgery will take care of.  I am in constant pain and have lack of strength in my thumbs.  I am in need of basel thumb arthroscopic surgery.  I did purchase the light therapy system to see if I could postpone my surgery until after summer is over as I am very active in the summer months and could not be in a cast for 6-8 weeks.  I am very pleased with the results I am getting with light relief.  The pain has lessened and I am able to function better.  There is still tenderness and I will need the surgery eventually, but for now, I am able to enjoy the summer without being in so much pain.</li>
    <li> Works for our family to heal and relieve pain. Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Was skeptical about purchasing this, but I am so glad I did.  I have bulging discs in my neck and back plus fibromyalgia.  After using it for 30 minutes that pain as greatly subsided for several hours without having to take anything for it.  For me, any relief is welcomed.</li>
    <li> my !st set few light stop working so i was lucky in 30 days return so i gave them back and other another one new for even less $ 65 and 2 weeks they still work&lt;br /&gt;but&lt;br /&gt;not sure how longer....it helps my tummy etc&lt;br /&gt; BUT if u need qulity and more 2x more light google &amp;#34; the ledman&amp;#34; he sells super quality 2x more light for almost same price</li>
    <li> Does the job without hassle effectively. So good I bought one for a buddy.  Seems to hold up to the use it gets.</li>
    <li> My physical therapist suggested I buy this because I have a back issue. It&#x27;s been wonderful. I feel relief and the price was great.</li>
    <li> When used regularly, relief is gradually gained. Relief is cumulative. Sporatic use is much less effective.</li>
    <li> Versatile enough with the pad to enable application of light to lower back or upper back. Even the back of the neck was able to be covered by the pad. The oval shape of the hand held device was comfortable for application to joints, even feet. The heat/light generated was very helpful in modulating pain in the muscles and joints. For anyone reluctant to keep taking pain medication, the light system works surprisingly well. Even if it is for a couple hours, when there is no other relief available. Being able to move about makes the healing seem to progress faster. A good product, but needs to be handled gently.</li>
    <li> not sure, wished I did not have to worry about break down by bending it.Otherwise I have not felt any improvement in use for joint pain. My dog seems to like it but gets restless after 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped my wife yet after months of using.</li>
    <li> VERY POOR PRODUCT. A wast of good money. I would NOT recommend this item to anyone. the light show does look nice.</li>
    <li> Works great, helps ease pain in both my feet and shoulders.</li>
    <li> The Light Relief System works great.  When I received it in the mail it was in great condition and well packaged.  the handheld device functions just as instructions say in the enclosed manual.  When I received it I was unable to bear any weight at all  on my right knee.  I am now walking in the house with walker.  I hope to get back to my quad cane in a few weeks more.  The Large body Pad does not work.  It worked the first time I used it.  Then the second time it was plugged in it had a weird smell like hot wiring.  I called my son and he agreed I needed to turn it off and not use it again.  If I had purchased the device without the large pad It would be 4 stars.  btw - I have also used this on other body areas.  It has not helped my arthritic wrist much, but oh what relief to my knee!</li>
    <li> I would not even give this product a star.  Does not provide any pain relief at all. Will be sending back.</li>
    <li> pretty colored light display to hide the fact that machine is not helping pain level. I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> i do like the product.  I was having hip pain and after using the product for about 3 days the pain went away.  I start using it again if i feel like the pain is coming back.</li>
    <li> One of the reviews I read before purchasing this called it a &amp;#34;glorified heating pad&amp;#34; which, based on my three weeks of experience, seems fairly accurate.  This is not a miracle cure or solution.  I think it provides some relief but that&#x27;s not what it advertises nor what I had hoped for.  If I had it to do over again, knowing what I know now, I would not have purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have two of these.  The one extra pad broke within several weeks and I have to contact the manufacturer to replace it.  The unit is not as powerful as some I have used but overall it works very well.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal because you get the extra large body pad with it. Seems to work well enough but I&#x27;m not throwing my pain pills away.</li>
    <li> product is great work like a charm and I now have a back up just incase this one breaks. I have tried every heating pad there is, but nothing works as good as this one. When something works so well you always keep a backup. I have worn the first one out from using it so much.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Gives relief to aches and pains.</li>
    <li> Seems to help my sore shoulder</li>
    <li> These are the type of things that are used in physical therapy. I find I get relief for back problems with the large pad and I get relief for the pulled tendons in my arm with the smaller one. The heat is an added plus . I am very glad I purchased this one with the additional large pad.</li>
    <li> I like it very much, so handy to have it in my home.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my pain. It does work to make the pain go away after repeated use.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was packaged very well. I&#x27;m not sure if this is working properly however.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything different when I toggle between low med and high.  I called the company but they weren&#x27;t very helpful. I may return it and get another one since I can&#x27;t confirm this one is functional.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about one week. Then some bumps that turned into sores appeared on my left leg, which if you know about bursitis the pain shoots down your legs. I only used the product on my left leg. I ended up having to take a week off work to semi-recover. The sores are still on my leg and they are painful to this day. For me this was a set back for my pain.</li>
    <li> Light Relief System I did get excellent relief the first time I used it. Thereafter I think the heat feature was giving the most relief. The size of the pads allow for them to be targeted to specific areas more readily than a standard heating pad. 2016--still using both pads. Highly recommended for ease of use &amp; well made rugged design!</li>
    <li> Good product with exception of the heat generated on the fourth and highest setting, could be a little hotter.</li>
    <li> This has been of great benefit to my husband and I in easing the pains that pop up.</li>
    <li> Like the light system. I think it works!&lt;br /&gt;My back is better, since using it.&lt;br /&gt;I feel comfortable recommending this product.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift for my Mom.  She really likes it and says it helps her a lot.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time at work and home.  Can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> Stopping siatic pain very well wife has copd she put it on her chest doctor we have had about four years said best lungs have ever sounded I work away from home quite a bit so am going to order one for her works good</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve use my sister&#x27;s for years prior to getting my own and it has been known to take away severe knee pain for months at a time without further use.  I like to focus on a particular area with consistent intermittent use for extended periods and once the relief is found I can move to a different area without an expectation of the return discomfort.</li>
    <li> All my relatives have pain relief with light therapy unit.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Dad.  After 2 months the large pad stopped working.  I had to call Light Relief directly.  They required me to pay $9.95 shipping and handling for a replacement.  It didn&#x27;t seem fair, but I paid the shipping.</li>
    <li> THE LIGHT RELIEF SYSTEM WAS NOT AT ALL EFFECTIVE FOR THE DEEP HIP AND THIGH PAIN IT WAS PURCHASED TO RELIEVE.  WE TRIED IT FOR ONE WEEK WITH NO IMPROVEMENT AT ALL  WE WERE QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH NO RESULT ACHIEVED..</li>
    <li> Apparently this was not the product for me.  Did not get any relief from any pain, anywhere!  Cost me quite a bit in the end.  Had to pay for the shipping (which was free initially).  Of course I had to pay to have it returned.  So this was a big loss to me for a gadget I got no relief from.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v e used this several times and not sure it does a darn thing. Thinking it is a waste of money and will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Not to sure if it really works for my pains yet but it dose work. I&#x27;m still using it so we will see my PT said it can take some time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful warming sensation and it takes the ge off of chronic pain for a little while.</li>
    <li> They were just as we had expected and worked wonderfully for what we needed them for. We will use them well.</li>
    <li> help relief the pain of her broken legs</li>
    <li> this is a fantastic product.  It has helped several of my family members of various aliments.  I also used it on my pet&#x27;s paw when it swelled up overnight (unknown cause)  and it took it down to normal size after only one use.  It has cured nail fungus on my husband and granddaughter (who had it over 2 years without any medications helping).  I use it for backaches, pain, and a lot of other  things I cannot recall at the moment.  Give it a try.  If you have one,  Use it.</li>
    <li> I love it.I stand all day and my legs ache. It Helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Cannot see that is made a difference</li>
