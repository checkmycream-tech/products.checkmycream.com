    <li> My wife has changed from many favorite scents to wearing this almost exclusively.  Delightful comination of lily of the valley and jasmine</li>
    <li> Jessica Mc Clintock is my favorite perfume. I absolutely love all of the products. I have always purchased Jessica in department stores, and this was almost too good to be true that I could purchase them on Amazon.com. I am so happy with the body powder. It&#x27;s a nice size and will last a long time. It&#x27;s such a silky body powder. My body feels so smooth and I don&#x27;t perspire. The  product is top of the line for me.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased when I got the package in the mail. It was wrapped very neatly inside the box with lots of very sturdy paper to support that there be no breakage.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it came really rapidly after I had placed the order.&lt;br /&gt;It is 100% what I had expected, and more!&lt;br /&gt;It is the first Christmas gift I have purchased for a friend, so I don&#x27;t know how they like it .....yet.&lt;br /&gt;BUT! They are HUGE fans of Jessica McClintock products, and asked specifically for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for helping me with my shopping</li>

    <li> Amazing fragrant quality for mail order perfumed powder.  Smells better than store bought.</li>
    <li> I did not know Jessica Mc Clintock came in powder and body lotion..I have always worn the perfume, so am really enjoying my purchase. I&#x27;m 102 yrs old!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for when I&#x27;m traveling.  I cannot be without this item when I travel, so always keep one on hand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been many years I had been using this fragrance. But with time I have felt its not the same as it used to be. I donor understand the reason. I think the overall quality is declined.</li>
    <li> the powder was a bit old.  different packaging than previous purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mother and she said it was just what she wanted and at great price.The product came within the time frame it was promised and all is well.</li>
    <li> It complements my perfurm and is wonderful for summer.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Light great smell</li>
    <li> This powder is nice.  Silky and smells great.  Love this after a shower and layers well with the perfume.  If you like the perfume, you will like the powder.</li>
    <li> The powder works very well with the perfume. It&#x27;s light and airy&lt;br /&gt;without smelling like baby powder. Definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this powder it&#x27;s perfect for after your shower and when you don&#x27;t want to use the actual perfume product.&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty good size for the price.  Thanks a ton.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy as it is very hard to find.  It serves so well as a refill for a Jessica M. powder box and powder &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; that ran out of powder.</li>
    <li> From a man&#x27;s point of view...it&#x27;s simple.  Anything with Jessica McClintock on it has a smell which can almost lift a dude onto his toes.  He will then folliow you, almost floating, with his eyes closed and head tilted slightly to one side.  He will most likely have a stupid grin on his face.</li>
    <li> Very nice sent, lite powder. Enjoyed wearing it. Wish it came in a dispenser where I could use a power puff. This would make it much easier to apply. However, It is a beautiful and fresh sent. I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Jessica McClintock is a fragrance I have used since it was developed in the 1980s.  It is the most beautiful scent I have ever worn.  I love to layer my fragrance with the body powder and the body lotion as well as the cologne itself.  I receive compliments all the time when am standing in line or in a elevator, etc.  I hope the fragrance and all of its products never goes away!</li>
    <li> why I chose this rating was it is fit the experience to the tee looking forward to shopping again it arrived on time and the price was great thank you quite satisfied</li>
    <li> I have used Jessica McClintock Eau de Parfum and Body Powder for 20 years.  I love the fragrance because it is not overpowering and is very fresh and clean.  I love the consistency of the powder and have the container with the puff from the last order.  I highly recommend all Jessica McClintock products, especially the Body Powder.</li>
    <li> This is the best body powder that I have used in a long time.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  I used it on my vacation to a very humid Belize where I was always wet and sticky except when I used Jessica McClitock body powder.  Amazon you ROCK! for getting it to me in two day without extra charge. It came just in time for my vacation.</li>
    <li> Smells so good.  Use it everyday and also to layer with the body cream and perfume when not going to work.  Works better for me than baby powder.</li>
    <li> Good powder, not widely available.</li>
