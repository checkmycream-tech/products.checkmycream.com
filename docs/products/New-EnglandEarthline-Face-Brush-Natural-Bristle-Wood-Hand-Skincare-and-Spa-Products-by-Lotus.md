### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great price too!</li>
      <li>It works great!</li>
      <li>Awesome scrub brush!</li>
      <li>The bristles on this brush are perfect for beginning body brushing.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>It is a great exfoliant for the face and neck, I love it!</li>
      <li>The handle is a good length for reaching all over the body.</li>
      <li>I ordered this brush because I had ordered it before and loved it.</li>
      <li>Its a good brush</li>
      <li>This brush is really good.</li>
      <li>Fabulous complexion cleansing brushes,especially good for exfoliation!</li>
      <li>Will be buying more!</li>
      <li>I use it with my face scrub, he is a nice brush.</li>
      <li>its a nice brush</li>
      <li>love this brush,it good for get blood circulating in the face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit more durable than another scrubber I got a year ago.</li>
      <li>Probably ok for a body brush</li>
      <li>so did not use it more than once.</li>
      <li>This is not the most durable skin brush.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a Clarisonic, but the bristles needed to be shorter, closer together with more in the brush, and could have been stiffer.</li>
      <li>I love the strength of the bristles.</li>
      <li>I get better results with a washcloth.</li>
      <li>i was just hoping the bristles would be more stronger, i really like a good scrub.</li>
      <li>The brush itself is sturdy and is holding up great so far at four weeks&#x27; use.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really found another good use for it either.  </li>
      <li>Fits right in your hand very comfortably.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth</li>
      <li>Now i just use to clean my fingers and toes - not on the face.</li>
      <li>Although I do notice the difference in how clean my face feels, it is an ongoing process to repair what has been going on for years.</li>
      <li>Low cost, simple, and effective is always a winning combination for me :) I recommend this.</li>
      <li>Of course there&#x27;s lots more to my retinue of beauty products, but for something so cheap this brush is nice and firm and really gets in there.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the $5-$6 dollars</li>
      <li>and this helps keep my pores nice and clean and keeps my face smooth of blackheads and dead skin that can flake off my face during winter months.</li>
      <li>so you really get a good cleanse and get off all the excess dry skin, etc.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable also.</li>
      <li>This brush is exactly what I was looking for in the shower.</li>
      <li>I tried to soften it up by scrubbing my leg with it and using hot water but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
      <li>But I love the wooden handle.</li>
      <li>and it looks much healthier!</li>
      <li>This brush is actually about 3&amp;#34; across and is much better for brushing.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve found this little cheap brush is awesome at both dry and wet exfoliating my face.</li>
      <li>I also bought a much stiffer brush for my body.</li>
      <li>They also flatten out and don&#x27;t really stay up.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>This is my first experience with natural bristles, so perhaps this is normal??  </li>
      <li>Nothing crazy incredible</li>
      <li>I loved the coarseness of bristles; unfortunately, they matted within the first 2 uses.</li>
      <li>This time I was sent a brush too large for a facial brush and too soft.</li>
      <li>but i have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised to see the price at 8.99 because I purchased two for under $6.</li>
      <li>Also, the brush head is too large to adequately clean/scrub the small spaces and curves of your face.</li>
      <li>After using this brush for less than two weeks, the bristles are pretty much shot.  </li>
      <li>Nice brush for dry brushing use; not sure if the face should be done though.</li>
      <li>Just go easy in small circles</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m currently looking for a new one.</li>
      <li>It is gentle, but rough enough that I feel my face is being exfoliated without added irritation that some brushes create.</li>
      <li>After this whole time which has been about a month only one bristle has fallen out but that is too be expected.</li>
      <li>Better than a buf-puf, and less expensive than the rotating facial brush, so, with a little old fashioned elbow grease, this little natural bristle facial brush does all that and more.</li>

<li> Better than a buf-puf, and less expensive than the rotating facial brush, so, with a little old fashioned elbow grease, this little natural bristle facial brush does all that and more.</li>
<li> After awhile the bristles in the middle are smushed down completely.    </li>
<li> This really gets rid of the dead skin too!</li>
<li> The bristles on this brush are far too stiff for facial skin.  </li>
<li> I like hard bristles but this was too much.</li>
<li> I recommend it as a travel brush or if you&#x27;re thinking about giving dry brushing a try.</li>
<li> A few of the bristles were falling off and some of the bristles were short and long.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s fairly soft on the skin and does what it should do but it also loses bristles every time I use it.</li>
<li> Bristles on brush are extremely rough.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s harsh and has left me with scratches on my face.</li>
<li> I just wet the brush, place a dab of cleanser on it, and start scrubbing in circular motion all over my face.</li>
<li> The bristles are not soft or hard, there somewhere in the middle</li>
<li> The bristles are not soft; they&#x27;re firm.</li>
<li> Cleanse extremely well on the face.</li>
<li> The bristles are too long and not packed tight enough for you to evenly exfoliate your face, you&#x27;ll wind up pressing hard to get it to work (which it won&#x27;t) and</li>
<li> It is very stiff and actually hurt.  </li>
<li> The only ones that are not bent, smashed down, and/or completely useless are the ones on the outside perimeter of the brush head.</li>
<li> then one odd bristle that stays up will scratch you.</li>
<li> I bought this brush because I heard if you wash and exfoliate with a brush it will help with black heads, etc.</li>
<li> But this little guy is sturdy.</li>
<li> I tried to stick it out for a few cleansings but the bristles never softened with use.  </li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> and you&#x27;ll get used to them, some reviewers complained about them being too rough</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s too small.</li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> It was a waste of money!  </li>
<li> it looked so small in the picture.</li>
<li> The quality was poor and not worth the $6-$7 that I paid for it.</li>
<li> and I have started seeing some improvement with my worst patches of large pores and blackheads</li>
<li> Its too harsh for the face, it hurts :(</li>
<li> Needless to say, I am returning this item.</li>
<li> I use Cetaphil cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals.</li>
<li> Do not throw away your money on this horrible brush.</li>
<li> hate it!</li>
<li> worst amazon.com purchase ive ever made!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t like anything \\&quot;soft\\&quot; or \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; when it comes to exfoliating or microdermabrasion. I&#x27;m an \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; user of these and I&#x27;ve found this little cheap brush is awesome at both dry and wet exfoliating my face. I glow. I don&#x27;t have to wear a stitch of foundation. Of course there&#x27;s lots more to my retinue of beauty products, but for something so cheap this brush is nice and firm and really gets in there. I love the strength of the bristles.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I heard if you wash and exfoliate with a brush it will help with black heads, etc. Although I do notice the difference in how clean my face feels, it is an ongoing process to repair what has been going on for years. But I love the wooden handle. I picked this one because I heard some complaints from customers that bought the plastic one saying it cracks in the shower. But this little guy is sturdy. Fits right in your hand very comfortably. The bristles are not soft or hard, there somewhere in the middle so you really get a good cleanse and get off all the excess dry skin, etc. After this whole time which has been about a month only one bristle has fallen out but that is too be expected. I find it does the job well and it looks like I&#x27;ll have this for awhile. So I would recommend this product out of all the brushes that are on amazon</li>
    <li> I read up on different brushes and ended up taking the plunge with this one. The brush itself is sturdy and is holding up great so far at four weeks&#x27; use. I use it with my cleanser when I wash my face and I have started seeing some improvement with my worst patches of large pores and blackheads (this doesn&#x27;t happen overnight.) Low cost, simple, and effective is always a winning combination for me :) I recommend this.</li>
    <li> Awesome scrub brush! Cleanse extremely well on the face. A+++Seller!</li>
    <li> After using this brush for less than two weeks, the bristles are pretty much shot.  The only ones that are not bent, smashed down, and/or completely useless are the ones on the outside perimeter of the brush head. This is my first experience with natural bristles, so perhaps this is normal??  Also, the brush head is too large to adequately clean/scrub the small spaces and curves of your face.</li>
    <li> This brush is really good. The bristles are not soft; they&#x27;re firm. You don&#x27;t even need to apply pressure when you&#x27;re washing your face. Since I keep my beard short {stubble}, this helps with any hairs in case I cut too close and it might become ingrown.     I&#x27;m surprised to see the price at 8.99 because I purchased two for under $6.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this brush I think it was $6, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t spend $9 for it. It was shedding bristles as soon as I opened it. After awhile the bristles in the middle are smushed down completely.    The bristles are too long and not packed tight enough for you to evenly exfoliate your face, you&#x27;ll wind up pressing hard to get it to work (which it won&#x27;t) and then one odd bristle that stays up will scratch you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m being asked to review something I never puchased. I bought a similar brush, but not this one.</li>
    <li> Nice brush for dry brushing use; not sure if the face should be done though. The price was very reasonable also. Will continue to order from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I loved the coarseness of bristles; unfortunately, they matted within the first 2 uses. Needless to say, I am returning this item.</li>
    <li> I like hard bristles but this was too much. They also flatten out and don&#x27;t really stay up. It&#x27;s just a smooahed brush now. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it and I&#x27;m currently looking for a new one. Ugh.</li>
    <li> This is not the most durable skin brush. It&#x27;s fairly soft on the skin and does what it should do but it also loses bristles every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Bristles on brush are extremely rough. Will not use this for my face. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> The quality was poor and not worth the $6-$7 that I paid for it. A few of the bristles were falling off and some of the bristles were short and long. I so do NOT recommend anyone to buy it!</li>
    <li> I use it with my face scrub, he is a nice brush.</li>
    <li> Its a good brush but i have sensitive skin and it kinda damaged my facial skin so did not use it more than once. Now i just use to clean my fingers and toes - not on the face.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are perfect for beginning body brushing. The handle is a good length for reaching all over the body. I initially bought this to use as a face brush bc it looked so small in the picture. I also bought a much stiffer brush for my body. This brush is actually about 3&amp;#34; across and is much better for brushing. I recommend it as a travel brush or if you&#x27;re thinking about giving dry brushing a try.</li>
    <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for in the shower. It is gentle, but rough enough that I feel my face is being exfoliated without added irritation that some brushes create. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a deep cleaning exfoliation brush!</li>
    <li> its a nice brush i was just hoping the bristles would be more stronger, i really like a good scrub.</li>
    <li> Its too harsh for the face, it hurts :( I dont think I will be using at all. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush because I had ordered it before and loved it. This time I was sent a brush too large for a facial brush and too soft. I cannot recommend this brush, nor will I try again.</li>
    <li> It was a waste of money!  After one use, the bristles got mangled and started to fall out. I had to throw it out! Do not throw away your money on this horrible brush.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a Clarisonic, but the bristles needed to be shorter, closer together with more in the brush, and could have been stiffer. I get better results with a washcloth.</li>
    <li> Seems well made but I couldn&#x27;t use this on my face.  It is very stiff and actually hurt.  I haven&#x27;t really found another good use for it either.  I tried to soften it up by scrubbing my leg with it and using hot water but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> Better than a buf-puf, and less expensive than the rotating facial brush, so, with a little old fashioned elbow grease, this little natural bristle facial brush does all that and more. It is a great exfoliant for the face and neck, I love it! Definitely worth the $5-$6 dollars and then some. A++</li>
    <li> I decided to try this out before buying one of those spinning brush kits. It works great! I use it every morning and night to wash my face. I have very oily skin and this helps keep my pores nice and clean and keeps my face smooth of blackheads and dead skin that can flake off my face during winter months. I use Cetaphil cleanser because it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals. I just wet the brush, place a dab of cleanser on it, and start scrubbing in circular motion all over my face. As a result, I haven&#x27;t had to hide under makeup to cover my zits and blackheads. This really gets rid of the dead skin too! It makes my skin feel so smooth and it looks much healthier! Great price too! Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Nothing crazy incredible but it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s a bit more durable than another scrubber I got a year ago. Wood and solid. I like it.</li>
    <li> Fabulous complexion cleansing brushes,especially good for exfoliation! Just go easy in small circles and you&#x27;ll get used to them, some reviewers complained about them being too rough but I&#x27;ve used a Clarisonic so I&#x27;m used to exfoliating my skin.</li>
    <li> love this brush,it good for get blood circulating in the face. will reccomend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are far too stiff for facial skin.  I tried to stick it out for a few cleansings but the bristles never softened with use.  Probably ok for a body brush but it&#x27;s too small.</li>
    <li> this brushes bristles bent during the second use. hate it! it&#x27;s harsh and has left me with scratches on my face. worst amazon.com purchase ive ever made!</li>
