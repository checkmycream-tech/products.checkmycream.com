<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product - I have been able to grow my hair long again due to this keeping my hair in such good shape.  I have tried Argan Oil - but like this better for finer hair.  Does not weigh the hair down - or build residue.</li>
    <li> i am currently deployed in Afghanistan and constantly having to wash my hair combined with the quality of water in this country has taken its toll on my hair leaving it dry and dead. this product makes it feel soft again and gives it just the perfect amount of life back to my hair, not too heavy, not too greasy. love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love morrocan oil and the light makes my hair not be so weighed down! It&#x27;s an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I was using morrocanoil treatment but decided to buy the light one, it seems to me that the original (not light) worked better for my hair.</li>
    <li> I tried it on once I received it on my dry hair and I can feel the difference already! It leaves my hair so shiny and soft. Will keep putting it on for a few more days to see if it helps with my frizzy fine hair.</li>
    <li> For the money and the great reviews this product has received, I was a little disappointed when the product didn&#x27;t make my hair any softer or silkier. It smells great when you put it on but after several hours or overnight, my hair felt dry and frizzy again. Maybe I just have really dry hair but I&#x27;ve used other products for half the price that do a better job. My wife who has thinner and softer hair also wasn&#x27;t impressed. Probably will not be buying this product again. I also tried using a lot more of the product in hopes of getting better results but it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
    <li> I got the light thinking it would be great for my fine hair. WRONG. I use just a tiny bit, I mean tiny bit, and my hair looks dirty. It has the grossest texture. I&#x27;m so disapointed! I DID however find a product called peratin that is amazing! This stuff was a waste of money</li>
    <li> This product is pretty helpful! Makes my hair shine, but doesn&#x27;t make it heavy. I use it almost everyday, even when I don&#x27;t wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I saw this product recommendation in InStyle magazine. It makes my naturally curly hair soft and silky and smells wonderful, too.</li>
    <li> Had used the product because a friend had it, loved the way it made my hair feel. Smells good too. It is a tad pricey, but found a  seller that had a bunch in stock, a good price and shipping wasn&#x27;t too costly. Shipped fast too. Would definitely order again through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Good service; I didn&#x27;t pay for expedited service and it arrived in 3 days.</li>
    <li> The aroma of this oil is to die for! very good.. i always buy this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great for color treated hair esp if you use a flat iron.</li>
    <li> There are only three words for this product, Oh My God.  I first read about this product on a Yahoo beauty article so I did more research into the product.  Every single review that I read only had great things to say, so I bought a bottle.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and this product makes my hair feel super soft, manageable and shinny.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> When I received the bottle today, the top had not been screwed on tight and the contents had leaked out into the packaging.  When I opened the package, the oil spilled onto my clothes and the front seat of the car.  I don&#x27;t know whether I would have liked the product since my 30+ dollars was completely wasted and now I have to figure out how to get the oil out of my clothes and upholstery.</li>
    <li> Love this product I color my hair and the oil make my hair shine and smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that helps keep my hair moisturized while I transition from chemically processed to Natural hair, and this product is it.  It&#x27;s not too oily or greasy, and although I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week, I do feel like my hair looks healthier.  I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone who is transitioning or even if you&#x27;re not transition, this is a good product for general hair health.  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is rather fine and it is pretty damaged from using a blowdryer and flat iron...the moroccanOil light treatment brought my hair back to life and it feels great!</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially for keeping the humidity from destroying my straight hair styles. I sm transitioning to natural hair and I sometimes still want to straighten my hair out and have it looked relaxed. this product helps to keep my hair from reverting. I like it better than the original one because it is so light. It is quite expensive but it is worth it if you want to keep the style in your hair  and because you don&#x27;t need to use alot of it a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy fine hair that&#x27;s dry from coloring. In the summer the only way  I can get it to look good is to get a salon blowout.  I have tried many products  and this product actually works.  It&#x27;s fabulous!  I did my own hair today and  it&#x27;s actually shiny and smooth!  Although it&#x27;s expensive I&#x27;ll actually save by  not getting salon blowouts!</li>
    <li> I have very fine blond hair and was concerned this product would make it look darker or oily or weigh it down, but it doesn&#x27;t!! I wanted something that would keep my hair healthy and enhance some shine and it does. I put it on when my hair is wet. Then I typically blow dry it and I have fewer broken hairs and split ends. It is smoother, shinier, and not weighted down, darker or oily looking. I have also used it but then let my hair air dry and it works just as well. It is an awesome product!</li>
    <li> MoroccanOil Treatment Light 3.4 Oz. was purchased for wife she is in love with this product,she said she would buy again</li>
    <li> Morrocan oil really keeps my hair soft and shiny and I use this product every day.  It is however, very expensive to buy from my Salon.  This was the exact product sold at the hair Salon I visit for much less money.  Shipping was very fast too!</li>
    <li> The oil was delivered long after promised and after the holidays. It was promised well before actual delivery. Would not purchase from the same vendor again.</li>
    <li> I a have fine, not sparse, full head of long naturally light-reddish blond hair.  I have a tendency to have oily scalp and the ends tend to be dry, esp during winter months.  I tried this at the recommendation of my hairdresser friend.  I absolutely love it!  I put it on the shaft and ends of my hair and avoid my scalp.  It keeps my hair from looking frizzy and fly away, while not making it flat and heavy.  I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product and speedy shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and I have dark brown waist length hair. I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil Treatment for about 3 weeks. I started by replacing my after shampooing products with Moroccan Oil. My hair was very shiny and smooth and I got a lot of complements from strangers but the downside was static. I now use the Moroccan Oil first, then the Graham Webb Silk Repair followed by Pantene Ice Shine Mousse and blow dry. My hair is noticably shinier but without the static. I&#x27;m not fond of the smell of the Moroccan Oil but it is not noticable after I blow dry. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with long hair or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This product does not give me the results I expected at all. I have long wavy hair (mid back) so I used a dime sized amount of oil on my damp hair on the bottom half then went about my routine like normal and blow dried and straightened my hair. Oh no! My hair was incredibly greasy! It looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in days. So I tried it again, this time just letting my hair air dry and be wavy. This time my hair wasnt greasy however the moroccan oil didn&#x27;t help with moisture or to decrease frizz at all. I&#x27;m still playing around with it trying to find some way I can at least use it since it was so expensive but I&#x27;m very disappointed with the product and will never purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have very damaged, fly away, fine hair and just a small amount of this detangles and conditions my hair making the fly aways almost non-existant. It also smells great-a faint beachy scent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccain Oil in my hair for the past 1 1/2 years and it has made a huge difference. I have thin hair that is prone to drying out and this product helps keep my hair healthy and looking healthy.  I actually bought the \\&quot;lite\\&quot; version on accident but like it even more then the original, it helps me have more volume and does not weigh my hair down.  I have recomended this product to many people and everyone is always pleased with their results.</li>
    <li> I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have limited options for hair products because I have fine, wavy hair.  Lots of popular products tend to weigh down my hair or make it look oily by 10am.  I have hair down to my shoulder blades and use about a nickle size drop for all of my hair.  Never flat or oily, it calms my frizz and softens all my ends.  I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this oil.</li>
    <li> My product just arrive!! It&#x27;s new and arrived in time!! I&#x27;m so happy :-) My hair ill be beautiful and shine...Thanks</li>
    <li> Most products are too heavy for my very fine and thin air.  This one makes it soft, shiny and smooths out any frizz without flattening it down.  I also really like the scent.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible!  My hair looks and feels so healthy now.  I usually don&#x27;t put product in my hair, but the light formula leaves it clean and shiny. I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my hair stylist used it in his salon. It really made styling my thick, curly hair very easy. I used it to blow dry it straight and to define curls. It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I use the light versoin of the oil because my hair is fine and shoulder length. I use just a dime sized portion in the palm of my hands, rub my hands together and spread evenly throughout my hair. It gives my hair shine and manageablity without weighing it down. It works especially well when I blow dry my hair, just leaving it to air dry I have to use half the amount of oil. My hair is dry due to having it foiled and because it is fine so the oil takes care of the static and fly away hairs and actually giving it a soft and luxurious feel with lots of body leaving it look very healthy for the first time in my life. I love it! Highly, Highly recommend it! Less expensive through Amazon then buying it from my hair care professional.Kudos Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This is very expensive but TOTALLY worth it! And you only use a tiny bit each time, so it really goes a long way. I still have about half a bottle left after using it everyday for 5-6 months . It just absorbs right into your hair and makes it really shiny. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all on your hair (a little greasy feeling on your hands, but I just rub it into my hands too!). I would highly recommend this to anyone with frizzy, curly hair like mine and anyone else for that matter. It really doesn&#x27;t feel greasy in your hair, so I think people with flat hair who could never use oily stuff in their hair could use this. And buying here through Amazon is much cheaper than getting it at the salon! I paid $40.00 for my bottle!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this on my hair, she didn&#x27;t have time to blow dry my hair, so I walked home (in the rain)...when I got home I styled my own hair... and was amazed at how soft and shiny it was!  If this was all done at the salon, i wouldn&#x27;t have given it that much thought...because my hair is always shiny and soft after a salon blow-out.  But since I styled it myself, I KNEW that the difference was the product itself.  I ordered it the same day!!  yes, it&#x27;s expensive...but you only need a little.  I have long hair, it&#x27;s naturally curly very thick and prone to frizz.  There are other products that work well... but NONE are this lightweight leaved no residue and the results are truly amazing. Bonus: it smells really good!  the first time I used it my boyfriend commented on how good it smells!</li>
    <li> Perfect for fine hair.  No snarling with this.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thin, limp, blonde hair. It gets greasy SO fast... greasy to the point that I can&#x27;t go a full day without rewashing my hair. When I use Moracaan Oil I can go for over two days without getting greasy... its crazy since its oil and every oil makes my hair greasier except this one. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell you if it actually makes my hair healthier... but it looks better and smells great. Very good for light hair.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this oil for my hair obsessed teenager, but ended up using it myself. I had tried a new coloring product on my own hair which came out far too dark. So I used a clarifying shampoo to remove the excess color followed by Moroccanoil. My hair was not only a lighter color, but it came out tangle free and soft. I now use Moroccanoil about once a week on the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift and it&#x27;s incredible. I have long wavy blonde hair and after using this, it became soft and smooth - i can&#x27;t stop touching it! I just put a few drops on my hair after showering - first on the ends and the rest all over the rest of the hair. love it!</li>
    <li> About 6 months ago, on a whim, I decided to go platinum blonde.  Since my natural hair color is dark brown with some gray but I had been dyeing it dark ash brown (almost black), I spent practically the entire evening stripping my hair with the strongest chemical bleach I could buy from a beauty supply store.  I must have put the bleach in my hair and waited for it to strip the dye and the natural color 6 times!  Needless to say, I woke up the next morning with little tufts of broken-off hair all over my kind-of-whitish-blonde head!  And then, just to make sure my hair was TOTALLY fried, I tried dye after dye from CVS to try to get a nice blonde color.  I finally gave up and went to a hairdresser who absolutely refused to touch my hair for at least 3 months because she was afraid it would all break off!  I had read about MoroccanOil in InStyle magazine, so when I saw it there at the salon I bought a bottle and started using it constantly, washing my hair as little as possible and adding the oil every day.  My hair didn&#x27;t look oily at all; it was so dry that it just drank this oil in; the amazing thing is that as soon as I started using the MoroccanOil, my hair didn&#x27;t look half bad! Within 3 months, the hairdresser was able to foil my hair to a more natural streaky brown and blonde color.  My hair is still damaged, but as long as I keep using the MoroccanOil in it, it looks very shiny and almost healthy.  Great stuff, and it smells very light and clean.  If this product could make the fried hay I had made of my hair look almost healthy and shiny, it will absolutely cure anything you&#x27;ve done to your hair!</li>
    <li> The product came as the description. It was new and well packaged. I was surprised with the delivery, because I live in France and it arrived sooner than it was previewed. At the beginning, I was a little worried, because I have never bought something from a seller different than amazon, but I am very satisfied. Today I bought two other bottles from the same seller to offer to my mother and my grandmother. They have not arrived yet and I hope not to be disappointed this time!     Another advantage of this seller is that it delivers outside USA, so we can also buy!    The product is excellent (morrocanoil light). I really recommend to everyone who has a thin and dry hair. Normally, this kind of product makes the hair heavy, but not moroccanoil. I am really satisfied and I will buy again and again! ;)</li>
    <li> I had read that this product was good for fine hair.  I can&#x27;t see any added value after using this for a month.  I think it is more for thick curly hair.  My mistake.  It&#x27;s probably a great product for those with a lush head of hair.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother.  She said it makes her hair soft.  Naturally, it&#x27;s kind of dry and stiff.  She said with this, her hair is soft and easier to style.  It makes a world of difference.</li>
    <li> MoroccanOil is my favorite hair treatment. It imparts shine without being greasy. It helped me grow my hair long since it helps with combing (no clumps or tangled hair anymore!) Plus it smells terrific. I have tried other argan oil treatments but this one is the best.  Absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Loved using this product. I got the Light version, because I have a lot of fine hair and always worried about weighing it down with products. A little bit goes a long way with this oil. Love the benefits and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product works really great for my thin hair.  It leaves my hair smooth all day without weighing it down.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I was worried about buying it on here because alot there are tons of scammers selling fake products - and the reviews tell horror stories. I don&#x27;t know if I just got lucky or I found a seller that wasn&#x27;t shady (UltrabeautyDayspa), but I&#x27;m sure I got good stuff. I have used the regular MoroccanOil in the past and now having used the &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; version I think it&#x27;s a little easier on my thin/fine hair, but not a major difference from what I can tell. The scent/feel is the exact same.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for blondes.  My hair has never felt healthier. It does good on wet or dry hair. One bottle lasts a couple months. Just two or three squirts per day, massaged into hair, brush throughly and style as desired.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like heaven in a bottle for girls with long hair. No more breakage and drop or two on your palms run through hair and it combs like a dream. Also adds a wonderful shine.</li>
    <li> This product is why my hair is down to my waist and I don&#x27;t have any split ends!  Works great with Andrew Lessman&#x27;s supplement for Healthy Hair, Skin &amp; Nails!</li>
    <li> I have VERY thin hair, this product does not weigh my hair down at ALL!  Sometimes products can even give a \\&quot;greasy or oily\\&quot;  look - NOT Morrocon oil.... I use this product daily as a detangler and even after blow drying to polish the look!</li>
    <li> With just a single pump, this oil leaves my fine hair feeling like silk.  At this point I have only used it after a light conditioning in the shower, but it&#x27;s winter, and it has helped my dry scalp induced flakes diminish.  More so, my hair is not breaking as it did before in the winter time (BTW, my hair is not dyed or treated in any manner). I would highly recommend this product, but do not put it directly on your scalp or near it or you will have a greasy hair look.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product for long wavy hair-makes it dry straight and smooth. For daughter&#x27;s long curly hair, helps keep frizz away. Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> this does wonders, I even use it on my infant&#x27;s hair, it all natural and few drops goes along way, it&#x27;a great for split ends, weak fragil, hair lacking luster not to mention smells great... this will last for few years.</li>
    <li> This is the best single hair treatment I have to have. Love at first sight, it made my hair silky smooth and glossy and I don&#x27;t want to be without it.     However, the glass bottle is horrible! I&#x27;ve already broken one and had to wipe off the not so very cheap oil off of my floors :(((( $40 down the drain!    Otherwise, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have blonde and very thin hair, I really worried that it could not work for me!&lt;br /&gt;But it is great! Use it everyday! Recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased MoroccanOil treatment light in this 3.4oz size from a local beauty supply store in the past, at a higher price for the exact same size and also included the pump top. There are a few minor differences in the layout of the box this came in and the label on the bottle (yes, I know this for certain because I kept the old box and bottle for comparison with the ones I just received!) but that happens, and isn&#x27;t a sign of a &#x27;counterfeit&#x27; product, as far as what I purchased and received. The light version isn&#x27;t just for blonde hair and fine textured, it&#x27;s also recommended for color treated hair - my hair is currently a little darker than the mid-level light brown, but I&#x27;ve colored it everything from blue black to burgundy to strawberry blonde and a lot of shades in between, so it&#x27;s important to use quality products that protect my hair from styling damage and add moisture so it doesn&#x27;t feel like straw. Add on the fact that I have hard water that I need a filter on my showerhead to reduce the chlorine level and it&#x27;s no wonder that I need a quality shampoo/conditioner followed by a hair styling treatment like MoroccanOil! I know that beauty supply stores and salons probably hate the fact that just about everything they carry on their shelves can be found on Amazon.com for less, but why pay more for the exact same thing??</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of the original Moroccan Oil at a spa and I was instantly in love. I didnt think it could any better until I discovered the Light version. I have long blond hair but its thin and this product works amazing. Leaves my hair silky, soft and protected from my blow dryer and straightener. I have yet to find a product that could do this without weighing my hair down. It&#x27;s amazing. And the bottle last forever since you only need a small amount. It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> The oil is nice and not greasy. It leaves the hair with a nice shine. I would recommend it. Unfortunately,the freight was too expensive.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best! I never go without it!!! My hair is so soft and manageable and smells so good! A little goes along way!</li>
    <li> Purchased a small bottle  of Moroccan Oil first to see how it agreed with my over-processed L&#x27;oreal blondish #8 hair color.  It worked wonders it give my blonde colored hair a natural shine that those spray bottle fail to accomplish.  I absolutely love this Moroccan Oil.  I just purchased this 3.4 oz. bottle and it is stupendious too.  Don&#x27;t hesitate - this is one great product.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil is one of the only hair moisturizing treatments that actually soaks into your hair and doesnt leave it greasy - love love love this product!</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Moroccanoil treatment&lt;br /&gt;which i purchased with the hydrating mask.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products, hence, i was a bit&lt;br /&gt;skeptical about the effect until i really tried&lt;br /&gt;and experienced the effect of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously my fine and colour damaged hair felt like dried twigs,&lt;br /&gt;upon 1st time application of the Moroccanoil treatment after the hydrating mask,&lt;br /&gt;i can feel big improvement on the texture, coz it feels more like real hair again, and now after several weeks usage, my hair is not so frizzy and i can actually see shines on my hair, which has not been there for several years til now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a really good product that even multiple visits to the saloon for hair treatments also cannot compare. And best part is, it does real repair, not temporary effects from so-called hair treatment products that are purchased off the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the price is slightly higher than as compared to some of those on-shelf products, but the important thing is, this moroccanoil really does repair and those does not neccessary will. Not just myself, before i order, so many people are using and praising it, so i thought to take a risk and try it, now i love it!</li>
    <li> This works well on the hair for shine and smooth silkiness. I just wish it was easier to apply so it wasn&#x27;t so messy.</li>
    <li> Great product but a bit too pricy so now I just buy pure argon oil and use that instead on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I like it very much. I recomend this product to other shoppers . .</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product is an old favorite of mine and I was thrilled to find a source to deliver it safely and quickly.</li>
    <li> this oil does miracles my hair was slightly damaged as soon as I applied it within 2 days it was as if my hair was never damaged my hair is now feels healthy I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Excellent product for managing frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and lasts for a very long time. gives hair a great shine.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser used this on me and I  just love it, so I keep getting ordering it. Friends ask me about what I use on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am really happy the way this oil smells. I can apply this oil during summer and go out. I have to wait and see how this oil helps my hair to grow and shine.</li>
    <li> Love it ...the fragrence is wonderful and It really tames wild hair...my husband loves it on his hair too. Good price</li>
    <li> After a recommendation by my hairdresser, I started using this everyday before styling and I never have split ends anymore.  I love it!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser has used this product on me and I loved it.  Having it at home to use everyday is great.  The product goes a long way - one bottle will last six months.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  very light scent and texture, i add a dab before i style and voila!</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair!! It helps it out a ton and doesn&#x27;t leave it nasty and oily like other oils do. My hair stylist only uses this oil and she couldn&#x27;t believe the deal I found on it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go a day without this!</li>
    <li> I live in Florida, have highlighted and multi processed blonde hair. This product is Fantastic and makes my hair feel like human hair and not straw. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the stuff that never runs out! I use 2 pumps per day and I&#x27;m still using it, months later. Worth it!</li>
    <li> Much better than conditioner</li>
    <li> The oil works wonders in my hair leaving it soft and shiny without weighting it down. I also use it in my 4 yr old daugther who has fine hair that tangles a lot; it helps keep her hair without many tangles. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it, makes my hair smooth and shining!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  I have finer hair but a lot of it and this oil is just making my hair so soft and smooth and getting rid of my tangles.  I used the regular Moroccan Oil but I saw this one and there IS a difference where this is a tad lighter for finer hair. LOVE IT and will order more.</li>
    <li> Loves what this does for my hair.. keeps it soft and shinning. I&#x27;m glad they have a light version for baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best for the hair!  Can&#x27;t go without it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product...Love it! Great for fine hair, doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Product and shipping as expected from seller.</li>
    <li> Greg&#x27;s wife here....A friend recommended this product to me and I am sure glad she did.  I have fine hair that often gets weighed down with different conditioners.  That is not the case with this product.  My hair is shiny, bouncy and healthy.  A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t let the price deter you from trying it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my hair is soft and shiny - looks so healthy. I used it at the beach to also protect my hair from the sun. Would definitely keep using this! It&#x27;s great to rub into hands and cuticles when done rubbing on your hair too! Last night I put some on my face as a night conditioner. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I must have. I have found this product to be one of the best things to apply on my hair. It does not weigh your hair down or make it look greasy. My hair looks healthy since I have started using it.</li>
    <li> This products good! I ordered this by accident and when I tried to exchange it they wouldn&#x27;t let me and told me to read the return policy horrible customer service! People who don&#x27;t back there products and keep your money are shady</li>
    <li> Fantastic product at a great price! My hair has gone from very dry to perfect texture. I love this product....</li>
    <li> This works great to keep my hair smooth and less frizzy. I was buying the smaller bottles but it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy the bigger one and to control how much you&#x27;re using with the pump. I highly recommend this for regular use for anyone with thick hair and to prevent damage when blow drying and straightening with a flat iron regularly.</li>
    <li> simple, if you have dry hair you must buy this product.  I have tried many expensive treatment oils, and this is the winner.  just put a small amount on damp hair and style....they look nice, heatlhy, and shiny.  yes, its expensive but it lasts a whileeee.</li>
    <li> I love this product for fine hair!  I have naturally curly which gets highlighted every three months so I&lt;br /&gt;HAVE to use the Moroccan Oil.  I have noticed that the Light variety is better for fine hair!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much this is a good product, I had got it in my salon after my hair stylist use it on my hair&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;m happy to know I can buy it online now</li>
    <li> The best oil I&#x27;ve used for my extremely dry hair.  I now use the shampoo and conditioner too.  Really softens my coarse dry hair, and makes it shine too!</li>
    <li> Can only use a little tiny bit and only on my ends. But it makes my hair look amazing and healthy.</li>
    <li> My hair can get dry especially in the humidity. I was hoping that this would make a difference.  It did not in any way improve the texture of my hair and I was very disappointed.  I even tried it as more of a hot oil treatment in the shower but that also did not help any.  I am now using Frizz Ease serum which is working better and is a lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> No seriously, this stuff is liquid gold to me. I have the most unmanageable frizzy hair, yadda yadda you know the story. Now I&#x27;m not saying this is going to turn you into a sex goddess overnight, I had some learning curves with this product (I used 3 or 4 pumps one time and my hair felt like an oil field for a week) and had to learn how much oil my hair was producing naturally but once you understand just how much you actually need, it will soak into the hair and let it do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine is this: After washing hair, and while hair is damp (not wet), I apply 2 pumps to my palms and rub them together to &#x27;heat&#x27; it up a little, and then slowly comb it through my hair, focusing on the ends. Do not let this product touch your roots! When palms are dry, brush out hair and it will magically become smoother. The next morning, I add another two pumps and for the next few days my hair is bouncy, fresh and gorgeous. This is one of the 3 items I will bring with me to a deserted island (the other two is chocolate and ipad). Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for hair that I bought recently.  I have lights in my hair and they were badly damaged. The oil recovered completely softness and shine. No doubt a quality product.</li>
    <li> This product is very good, my hair is thin and this product don&#x27;t leave my hair &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; . I recommend.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel great.  I have blonde, fine, wavy hair that I straighten and will often feel dry and frizzy on the ends.  This makes my hair so smooth, free of tangles, smells great, love it!</li>
    <li> My hair is really soft with that product. I use Moroccan Oil Treatment Light every day that I wash it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Moroccan  oil product ,, have tried different ones in past but this one is the best ....</li>
    <li> not as good as i imagine. my hear is the super thin type and easily to get static in it. after saw the feedbacks from others i decided to try it. however, this moroccan oil light not only didn&#x27;t make my hear shining but not make my hear smother. actually i didnt see any change or effect before and after using the oil. perhaps i&#x27;ll try normal moroccan oil version next time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love Moroccan oil. My hair is fine and thin and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
    <li> fast shipment good packing love the product.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine and tends to dry out very quickly with daily use of a curling iron. The Moroccanoil keeps my hair healthy and shiny.  Did I mention on how much I LOVE the smell!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser just told me about Moroccan oil yesterday at the salon. I tried it in my hair before blow drying it, and it was amazing! It left my hair very soft and shiny. I have very fine blonde hair, which tends to get very oily and weighed down quite easily. I had no problems with this whatsoever... just make sure you avoid your roots. I think people are getting confused with the Moroccan oil LIGHT. It&#x27;s not that the oil is just lighter feeling on your hair, it&#x27;s made for people especially with light ( blonde hair) bc people with light hair were having a problem with the original Moroccan oil. Since it&#x27;s such a dark colored oil, it was giving people with blonde hair a dark amber tint to their hair. That&#x27;s why they came out with the light version.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised when I received this product only because in the lower back of it, there is a spot that states the expiration date and the year 201 was there with the last two digits smeared...not sure if it&#x27;s expired? Probably....so not too happy with this product</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  My hairdresser had used it on my hair and seeing the beautiful sheen on my hair,I immediately bought a bottle.  You won&#x27;t regret buying this product!</li>
    <li> No matter how many other oils I try, I always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great for your hair. My hair is so much better after using this oil. This oil has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I started using MoroccanOil about 4 months ago and I have seen a HUGE improvement in the overall health of my hair. I use it daily after washing my hair, and when I last went to get my hair cut and colored, my beautician said my hair has never looked or felt better and she asked what I was doing differently. I cannot say enough great things about MoroccanOil Treatment! It is kind of pricey but it is SO worth it!</li>
    <li> when used immediately after a shampoo while the hair is still damp, it is absorbed , never leaving a sticky residue. It is especially good for the coarser gray hairs. It leaves my hair softer with a beautiful shine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 years now &amp; it has made my hair fabulous! It&#x27;s strengthened my hair &amp; has grown so long. Could not live without it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. it makes my hair so healthy after continual use.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccan Oil and this ran a little cheaper than in the salon!!! Came super fast I will def order again when I begin to run low!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, very fine hair (an awesome combo, let me tell you).  This product makes my curls completely manageable.  The product is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  Also, a little goes a long way so the bottle lasts forever!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and was having dryness problems. This oil is very light and makes my hair feel stronger, healthier and shiny. There is no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel at all and the scent is mild and lovely.</li>
    <li> My wonderful mother has been trying products for her hair as long as I can remember. She loves this stuff, so I figure it must be good. I never have used it. It sure did make a great stocking stuffer for her.</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to this product. She used it on her hair. I use argan on my skin and on my face. My skin is terribly dry. Working out side doesn&#x27;t help. Using argan does help. I hope anyone who uses argan likes it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, with the main ingredient, argon oil that is scented. Regular argon oil isn&#x27;t scented; if it&#x27;s stale, then it won&#x27;t smell right. With Moroccan Oil, there is know stale scent, but a pleasant one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rather expensive, so use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> Suffer from dry hair, especially the ends, in the winter.  This is nice and light and works! I would recommend to anyone with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different oils. This is the best and worth every penny. Do not substitute for a cheaper version.</li>
    <li> Very light on my hair, doesn&#x27;t make it sticky or bogged down with an oily feel.  Pleasant fragrance that fades gradually - not overwhelming or perfume-y.  My hair is both color treated and permed, and this product softens it wonderfully between washes.  A little goes a long way.  I use this in addition to conditioner and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for curly frizzy hair, its light and not to greasy and it makes your hair extremely smooth and shiny. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect product, perfect delivery. Thrilled!</li>
    <li> Love love love it.  Makes my hair feel so good.  My hair looks healthy.  This product is the best.  Can&#x27;t say enough and I always get compliments on how good it makes my hair smell.</li>
    <li> Awesome product and sent in good time! It makes my hair soft and shiny and it smells amazing! I love this!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I used to buy it through a friend&#x27;s daughter who is a hairdresser but even at her discount I was paying $40 for a 3.4 oz bottle.  This is a wonderful buy!</li>
    <li> Great for wavy or curly hair.  Smooths my hair when I blow it straight.  My hairstylist recommends this product as well.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best.  The formula isn&#x27;t different from the original.. it&#x27;s made for blondes or light hair.  Can&#x27;t get by without it.  This and WEN are my secret weapons to shiny healthy hair, even though some of the ingredients in MorroccanOil may not be the purest for your hair- haven&#x27;t looked at the ingredient deck lately. All I know is it works time and time again with no yucky buildup problem.  I like the light version (blonde beauty) better than the original. Just awesome stuff. Period.  I use it on pillow case dried hair.  Greatest body and shine. Any light haired person needs this.  I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> I have tried the Suave keratin treatment and the Agean Oil. NOT THE SAME. Moroccan Oil is the only thing that smooths my hair all day and makes it look shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> Since the 1st application my hair looked great, this oil honors its benefits - will order more products of the same brand!</li>
    <li> I have tried others like Kerastase and in my opinion no other oils beat the Marrocanoil - Normally, I buy the ordinary version, but this time I bought the light one. I truly recommend for those who has dry and damage hair. Also, when I color I add 2 drops in the hair color, it is adds shine to my hair, it works for me! You pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> Love the product and the price and would certainly recommend buying in on Amazon to friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product and pay almost doulble to purchase it in the store.  It was such an easy process.</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan oil products and this one works great.  It defrizzes my hair without weighing it down.  Great for blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My African American hair is natural and I get keratin treatments to help with the frizz.  Part of my regimen is to put a little of the Moroccan oil on my hair nightly.  Coupled with the Moroccan Oil hydrating shampoo, conditioner and hydrating mask, my hair is always soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this or not. I was really worried it would leave my hair feeling and looking greasy and weighed down but it didn&#x27;t do that at all. In fact it added body, helped control frizz and left my hair super shiny looking. I would buy this again in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> For dry hair this is perfect.  I have normal hair on top and it does not make your hair greasy.  It eliminates fly aways and is good for dry ends.  You can&#x27;t &amp;#34;over do&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as good as the regular treatment that isn&#x27;t light. I&#x27;m not happy with it. It&#x27;s got to be because it&#x27;s a light product. I have used the regular type before and loved it.</li>
    <li> I have not bought this item but I was wondering if it comes with a pump that connects to the oil?</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan Oil! It is not greasy at all and cuts the drying time in half. MY hair is very thick and frizzy but when I finished blowing my hair dry this product makes it silky and smooth. Love it. Will keep repurchasing!</li>
    <li> The Moroccan Oil was an excellent deal. Despite of being not so chip, this product is very good. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the passed and it&#x27;s absolutely amazing! It really does the job of making your hair soft and shiny plus it smells great! I can&#x27;t wait to get my next bottle!!</li>
    <li> I first used this product at the salon. I loved how it made my hair shine, but didn&#x27;t make it feel greasy. It can also be used on your&lt;br /&gt;skin.  Great product, and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair really soft and silky. It makes my hair smell even better than it feels too! Wonderful :)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> It does leave my hair softer, but it doesn&#x27;t help with my frizzies at all. I use it more for conditioning.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and using this product every other day, makes my hair much softer, so less breakage is occurring!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Suave keratin treatment and the Agean Oil.  NOT THE SAME.  Moroccan Oil is the only thing that smooths my hair all day and makes it look shiny and healthy.  I use it everyday.  When I run out of Moraccan oil I use the Agean Oil I bought but never finished and every time I remember why Moraccan oil is the best.</li>
    <li> I used the original Moroccan Oil before this lighter version and it is lighter. With the original, if you use too much then it can make your hair sticky and greasy, where as with this one even if I use a bit too much it sort of absorbs in or works itself in, especially over night. It certainly makes my hair more smooth and thicker, it sort of adds a protective coating as well as nourishing it. My hair is naturally dark blonde and has been highlighted to medium blonde. My hairs are quite fine but there are a lot of them!</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by reading all of the wonderful reviews. I&#x27;m a brunette with heavy thick hair that still somehow finds a way to fly around my head. So annoying. Yes, it&#x27;s a little problem but annoying.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to read about this oil and how it would solve the flyaways. Once I received it, I used it 3x the first week. I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and make my hair oily looking. I was very careful (and still am) to apply it to the ends of my hair (and mid shaft).&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using it for a month, and my hair does look better for it. Just not that much better. Not one person has noticed, and I even forget I&#x27;m using it half the time when I look in the mirror to see how it&#x27;s going. :)&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;ve been happy with this product but would probably not order it again as it didn&#x27;t solve my flyaway issues. I&#x27;ve also noticed that Target is now selling a version by Fructier/Pantene (one of those brands) and it works just as well. The name brands in the store are so much cheaper and work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed an improvement in my hair but not enough to continue to buy this. I am saddened by this as I was expecting an absolute miracle.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try it, I would still order it as I think it has more to do with the structure/chemistry of your personal hair. I think everyone is going to have different experiences with this. I like it, I just don&#x27;t LOVE it as much as I thought I would.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried it on the little munchkin. Weighed her hair down but she is a little one (grade school) so shocker there.</li>
    <li> I fined that it helps detangle my hair and dries my hair faster. It is a nice smell and leaves hair smooth. It has also helped with my dry scalp. Great delivery time and great price.</li>
    <li> I tried morrocanoil years ago and loved it but because of the price stopped buying it... Since then I have tried every other cheaper version I could find and still never was as happy as I was when I wa using morrocanoil. I opted for the light this time as I have thin hair and I will never go back to anything else! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me &amp; I LOVE it!  It makes your hair soft and I think easier to manage styling!  It smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and I love it!  (I hate when products smell terrible!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair so I buy the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference from when my hairdresser uses the &#x27;regular&#x27; Moroccanoil on me.</li>
