### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful scent and product.</li>
      <li>And awesome company.</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to getting a wonderful whipped moisturizer to use on my face &amp; hair.</li>
      <li>This cream, plus Elma &amp; Sana&#x27;s Argan Oil, and my humidifier &#x3D; wonderfully hydrated winter skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for that.</li>
      <li>This butter smelled wonderful.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels great!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This does a great job.  </li>
      <li>This cream felt good</li>
      <li>BUT......... I order one and it came in all full of MOLD!!!</li>
      <li>the oil is good but there are chunks of it that does not blend in and lays in chunks on my face and there are also some kind of leaf that does not i have to pick out.</li>
      <li>I liked this cream but would have loved it if it were smoother and creamer.  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I bought it for my hair, feet, elbows, and I&#x27;m happy with it, except the lavender smell in my opinion is too strong.</li>
      <li>The lavender scent is a nice bonus, since I do use it at bedtime.</li>
      <li>when I take some, I rub it between my palms to warm up and soften and then apply.</li>
      <li>The lavender is pleasant and not too strong.  </li>
      <li>In this heat this is perfect, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t take a lot love it, thank you for sending so fast</li>
      <li>love it real rich, creamy</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of this product as a moisturizer however and wish it was more of a body butter, its more like a moisturizing balm</li>
      <li>I received this as a gift, and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this product.</li>
      <li>I have used argan oil in my hair and love it</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It is light and creamy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light, soothing scent.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave oil on my clothing.  </li>
      <li>and this stuff feels like butter, sinks in nicely and smells amazing.</li>
      <li>Another great whipped shea butter with argan oil and some other neat stuff.  </li>
      <li>MOLD growing from inner lid all across top of the brand new whipped butter moisturizer !!!!</li>
      <li>Love the ingredients but wished it came in larger sizes!</li>
      <li>It was hot and it came to me liquid.</li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Initially, it feels like a very dense cream (almost a clay consistency), but as soon as it comes in contact with body heat, it turns into more of an oil consistency.</li>
      <li>but this is just fine as i have super dry skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>This product has helped so much.</li>
      <li>When I lifted the inner lid -the product was full of mold.  </li>
      <li>It is great for the backs of my hands and cuticles, which were becoming incredibly dry, but this butter fixed the dry spots and kept them moisturized far longer than other hand creams.</li>
      <li>I mainly use it just before bed, as it does feel a bit oily just after application.</li>
      <li>With this beware you too might get in your new unopened jar.</li>
      <li>There was a slight issue with one shipment, I contacted the company via email, they responded very quickly and rectified the issue promptly with no fuss.i have purchased thir Argan oil and clay powder as well</li>
      <li>First time I tried this product and the last.  </li>
      <li>After trying ump-teen products for dry weathered skin, this moisturizer truly makes a positive difference.  </li>
      <li>Seems like the older I get, everything starts to dry out!</li>
      <li>and I will continue to, these products are a great natural alternative for all that toxic skin care crap.</li>
      <li>, well worth it in only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I live in the Midwest, and the winters are very, very dry and create skin chaos, especially on my hands and face.</li>

<li> I live in the Midwest, and the winters are very, very dry and create skin chaos, especially on my hands and face.</li>
<li> Highly scented but just a little bit too greasy for me.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick, but warms quickly in your hands for easier application.</li>
<li> I have very dry hands</li>
<li> From other reviews it doesn&#x27;t appear that I received a product in usable condition.</li>
<li> Minnesota winters are extremely D-R-Y!</li>
<li> The lavender smell is slight and doesn&#x27;t linger all day.  </li>
<li> This is a thick cream which has resolved my dry legs and elbows almost  overnight</li>
<li> Inside the factory shrink wrap was the small plastic jar.  </li>
<li> I have allergies but usually items with lavender</li>
<li> Upon opening the jar what I found was a unusable hard dehydrated blob caked to one side of the jar.</li>
<li> If you are not a lavender fan, don&#x27;t buy it (or use it on your feet, since it&#x27;s hard to smell them) or you&#x27;ll just have to wait till the smell airs out.</li>
<li> What I received from my Amazon order through Health Spot, the supplier was a BIG disappointment.</li>
<li> it is just too ICKY to describe.</li>
<li> does what it says it will but its just to thick to put on your arms or legs.  </li>
<li> So sorry I wasted my money buying in this manner.</li>
<li> Smell of this product actually made me sick.  </li>
<li> I like the product, it&#x27;s very thick, so</li>
<li> Smells like an expensive spa.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product from Amazon&#x27;s sources as the quality is questionable.</li>
<li> I have terrible problems with my heels cracking and extremely dry feet during winter.</li>
<li> Maybe this jar is bad, thinking of going to a retail store and smell another jar.</li>
<li> i was disappointed with this product.  </li>

    <li> Love the smell of this product. Smells like an expensive spa. I don&#x27;t care for the consistency of this product as a moisturizer however and wish it was more of a body butter, its more like a moisturizing balm but this is just fine as i have super dry skin.</li>
    <li> And awesome company. I&#x27;m on my second jar of this stuff and can&#x27;t recommend it enough. I have very dry hands and this stuff feels like butter, sinks in nicely and smells amazing. There was a slight issue with one shipment, I contacted the company via email, they responded very quickly and rectified the issue promptly with no fuss.i have purchased thir Argan oil and clay powder as well and I will continue to, these products are a great natural alternative for all that toxic skin care crap. My skin feels great!</li>
    <li> I have used argan oil in my hair and love it so i thought i should try it on my face.  the oil is good but there are chunks of it that does not blend in and lays in chunks on my face and there are also some kind of leaf that does not i have to pick out. i was disappointed with this product.  It was hot and it came to me liquid.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I live in the Midwest, and the winters are very, very dry and create skin chaos, especially on my hands and face. I received this as a gift, and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s very thick, but warms quickly in your hands for easier application. The smell is pleasant, not overwhelming. It is great for the backs of my hands and cuticles, which were becoming incredibly dry, but this butter fixed the dry spots and kept them moisturized far longer than other hand creams. Plus my hands don&#x27;t feel sticky. I love it! This cream, plus Elma &amp; Sana&#x27;s Argan Oil, and my humidifier &#x3D; wonderfully hydrated winter skin.</li>
    <li> Smell of this product actually made me sick.  I have allergies but usually items with lavender don&#x27;t bother me.  The smell is stronger than I thought and I won&#x27;t be using this product.  Maybe this jar is bad, thinking of going to a retail store and smell another jar.</li>
    <li> I love this product. BUT......... I order one and it came in all full of MOLD!!! UGH..................UGH UGH UGH UGH</li>
    <li> Another great whipped shea butter with argan oil and some other neat stuff.  The lavender is pleasant and not too strong.  The only reason I left my review at two stars was because I have yet to confirm if the lavender oil that they use in this product is actually food grade (food grade being what you want for almost any interaction with essential oils).</li>
    <li> After trying ump-teen products for dry weathered skin, this moisturizer truly makes a positive difference.  My hands and face feel like they did twenty years ago.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts all day.  I&#x27;m sold.  Thank you Elma &amp; Sana.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to getting a wonderful whipped moisturizer to use on my face &amp; hair. Having read blog testimonials about the benefits of Argan oil. What I received from my Amazon order through Health Spot, the supplier was a BIG disappointment. Upon opening the jar what I found was a unusable hard dehydrated blob caked to one side of the jar. From other reviews it doesn&#x27;t appear that I received a product in usable condition. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product from Amazon&#x27;s sources as the quality is questionable. So sorry I wasted my money buying in this manner.</li>
    <li> love it real rich, creamy</li>
    <li> Minnesota winters are extremely D-R-Y! I have terrible problems with my heels cracking and extremely dry feet during winter. This product has helped so much. Initially, it feels like a very dense cream (almost a clay consistency), but as soon as it comes in contact with body heat, it turns into more of an oil consistency. I like this because it&#x27;s easier to apply (as a cream) than liquid oil, yet it penetrates the skin like an oil after it had been rubbed in. I use it on my feet, cuticles, lips, hands, elbows, and have even used it as an overnight hair treatment. I mainly use it just before bed, as it does feel a bit oily just after application. I don&#x27;t mind that, because it WORKS! The lavender scent is a nice bonus, since I do use it at bedtime. It&#x27;s a light, soothing scent. I&#x27;m on my second jar and have gotten a third to get me through this winter.</li>
    <li> This butter smelled wonderful.  It is light and creamy.  I would recommend this to others!  Love the ingredients but wished it came in larger sizes!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has 5 ingredients.  That&#x27;s it.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave oil on my clothing.  I use it after showering and wait about 3 minutes after applying it to get dressed.  The lavender smell is slight and doesn&#x27;t linger all day.  This does a great job.  I had surgery and use it on my surgical scar and I swear, it is helping it to fade.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Highly scented but just a little bit too greasy for me.</li>
    <li> In this heat this is perfect, not greasy, doesn&#x27;t take a lot love it, thank you for sending so fast</li>
    <li> I liked this cream but would have loved it if it were smoother and creamer.  It def. does what it says it will but its just to thick to put on your arms or legs.  So I use it on my feet.  It&#x27;s perfect for that.</li>
    <li> This is a thick cream which has resolved my dry legs and elbows almost  overnight, well worth it in only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought their oil which I use sparingly on my hair. Seems like the older I get, everything starts to dry out!</li>
    <li> This cream felt good but I just did not like the smell.  I would ave given 5 stars if the scent were different.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it&#x27;s very thick, so when I take some, I rub it between my palms to warm up and soften and then apply. I bought it for my hair, feet, elbows, and I&#x27;m happy with it, except the lavender smell in my opinion is too strong. If you are not a lavender fan, don&#x27;t buy it (or use it on your feet, since it&#x27;s hard to smell them) or you&#x27;ll just have to wait till the smell airs out.</li>
    <li> First time I tried this product and the last.  Inside the factory shrink wrap was the small plastic jar.  When I lifted the inner lid -the product was full of mold.  MOLD growing from inner lid all across top of the brand new whipped butter moisturizer !!!! ICK !!!  With this beware you too might get in your new unopened jar. I would not even give it one star it is just too ICKY to describe.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and product. Helps heal and protect you skin.</li>
