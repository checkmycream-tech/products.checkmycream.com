      <li>That might work fine for a lot of people.</li>

      <li>It is lightweight and adjusts to fit any sized head.</li>
      <li>That isn&#x27;t a great big deal since once you adjust it for you head,</li>
      <li>This is adjustable, fits perfectly, it&#x27;s comfortable and it works.</li>
      <li>The mask is lightly padded.</li>
      <li>Comfortable.</li>
      <li>enjoy using this mask because whenever I put it on, I do not feel it at all, it is so light and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>

      <li>/&gt;- blocks out the light very well.</li>
      <li>I really love how soft and squishy this sleep mask is compared to others that I have tried.</li>
      <li>This has to be the most soft and silky sleep mask I have ever felt.  </li>
      <li>I did a test hand wash with a tiny amount of Woolite and warm water</li>
      <li>That, combined with a fairly generic, but effective adjustment strap make this one</li>
      <li>Out of all the masks I have owned, this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>It did not let light in, so the absence of the flap is not an issue - and most brands do not come with the flap anyway.</li>
      <li>just right.</li>
      <li>Needed a light weight comfortable mask to keep out light and shield eyes from dry out from use of our ceiling fan.</li>
      <li>One way is to have it professionally dry-cleaned, but I am not sure this is the best route because out of the bag this mask has zero odors.</li>
      <li>Folds up small so this product would be great if you travel.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great eyeshades - soft, luxurious-feeling, snug but not hot. A good price, a good buy! A year+ later, used every night,  and these are still my favorite eye shades.</li>
    <li> works as expected. soft and comfortable</li>
    <li> WOW!  It just WORKS! Very comfortable, stays on, no light leaking, and I haven&#x27;t been waking off and on all night.  :)</li>
    <li> VERY SOFT, internally-padded with adjustable rubberized-strap headband for comfort. Item is well made for long service and the price is the best I have found for a this quality of sleep mask.  ~ Yes, I would recommend it to anyone looking for such an item and would buy it again, if needed.</li>
    <li> I like the fast delivery. The material is nice and smooth. I am very satisfied with my order.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a sleep mask that my wife used that was staining our pillowcases. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too thin to really feel comfortable on her face; she prefers the kind with lots of padding. The pictures for this made it look like there was at least some thickness to it, but it&#x27;s actually very thin -- basically just two layers of cloth. It&#x27;s probably a great choice for a lot of people, but it doesn&#x27;t server our needs.</li>
    <li> It is so thin it presses against the eyes from the tug of the strap. Not my cup of tea. This item is a perfect example of why I so rarely am satisfied with web purchases unless I have first seen them in person.</li>
    <li> Very soft abd silky. Helps me fall asleep faster. Feel as if my eyes are well rested when i wake up</li>
    <li> The description doesn&#x27;t lie - this is extremely comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologise if the video is a bit dark but I wanted to show off the product just before I went to bed and that unfortunately means it is pretty dark outside!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love sleeping with this even though I never used to use sleeping masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommend - especially if you do shift work and night work</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using a sleep mask, but needed one on a recent trip. This mask exceeded my expectations - very comfortable and quite effective.</li>
    <li> This has to be the most soft and silky sleep mask I have ever felt.  It blocks out all the light except for around your nose but, I find that a normal thing for sleep masks that I have tried.  I like the adjustable elastic band that hold the sleep mask in place.  Lightweight and very comfortable to wear.  Folds up small so this product would be great if you travel.&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> This mask is really comfortable. I&#x27;ve tried so many now that my very old one is falling apart. I&#x27;m very happy with this. It&#x27;s a bit warmer on my eyes than I&#x27;d like, but still really nice. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and blocks out all light.</li>
    <li> Comfy, blacks out completely.</li>
    <li> Works well, very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  I&#x27;ve used it for three nights so far and find it very comfortable.</li>
    <li> feels good, keeps out the light, fair price, I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> I love this eye mask! The silk fabric is fantastic, not hot at all! It is lightweight and adjusts to fit any sized head. It fits over my nose just fine, with no light coming in from the bottom. There is great coverage all around. Out of all the masks I have owned, this one is by far my favorite. I never want to be without it!!</li>
    <li> I really love how soft and squishy this sleep mask is compared to others that I have tried. This one has an adjustable strap that makes it much better for me too. I can get a perfect fit. The eye coverage area is fairly large, so no light can sneak in. For some strange reason, I can not get myself to fall asleep until the early morning hours, so I tend to sleep in a bit in the mornings. I use the sleep masks so that the might doesn&#x27;t wake me in the mornings. This mask is made of silk, so keep that in mind before you wash it. It&#x27;s very soft and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, this is a wonderful product.  I love it.  I have used it for short daytime naps and will use it for migraines.  Please note that it ships from Europe and needs more time to be delivered.</li>
    <li> Very soft and silky. Covers a large area. Strap is adjustable and stays tight on my small head. It does feel a little warm though, so someone sensitive to the heat may not like that.</li>
    <li> this mask is so simple yet it feels very luxurious&lt;br /&gt;the material used is silk which is by itself a very smooth, thin, and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using this mask because whenever I put it on, I do not feel it at all, it is so light and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the length for additional comfort, that is always a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for meditation too, since it is very comfortable, silky and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;over all I like this mask, it is very simple and it came as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;The mask was sent to me for testing</li>
    <li> It goes beyond  expectations</li>
    <li> Most certainly blocks out light, but even when fitting comfortably, it somewhat presses on my eyes as I use it.  If I loosen it anymore it will slip around so it&#x27;s at a happy medium.&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend it for the comfort I do have &amp; the price point.</li>
    <li> This mask has a nice fit, I have slept well with it on.  Sometimes it moves a little, but not much.  It doesn&#x27;t put undue pressure on my eyes.  I like it!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very Comfortable and keeps light out - love it!</li>
    <li> Even after being washed it stains the pillowcase.</li>
    <li> Feather light and silky. Keeps the light out. Don&#x27;t know what else I could reasonably expect from a mask.</li>
    <li> As advertised. I wear this under my C-PAP Mask for a more comfortable sleep while wearing my mask. Very soft and used it right out of the package.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, the silk feels very soft. I use it to prevent the morning light of waking me up, so this mask suffice to my purpose. It doesn&#x27;t block light completely. If you move too much at night, the mask will come off. Also, if you keep the mask tight to prevent it from falling, it may get a little uncomfortable on the eyes.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is light weight, completely shuts out light and is very comfortable on my small sized, tender scalp and pressure sensitive ears. I&#x27;m ordering another for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> Soft, well made, blocked out all the light for me.  I travel a lot and I&#x27;m not leaving home without it.</li>
    <li> It is totally comfortable and blocks out light nicely.  Stays in place( since I am a side sleeper) but does not give me a headache.  Great product.!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable and soft.  The elastic adjustable band is easy to adjust and works just fine.</li>
    <li> Nicely made and comfortable to wear. Light weight and not too hot.</li>
    <li> - SO soft.&lt;br /&gt;- blocks out the light very well. Better than many eye masks I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;- no staining! My last eye mask put stains on all my pillows and sheets. This one is stain free.&lt;br /&gt;- stays on all night, even though I toss around&lt;br /&gt;- adjustable strap so that I can get a perfect fit.</li>
    <li> Very soft and comfortable.  Bought for me and my husband.  No complaints</li>
    <li> Very light weight. Covers surprisingly well. Comfortable.</li>
    <li> This mask is soft and comfortable and definitely blocks out the light. It has an adjustable band so you can get the tightness just right. It does leave a few purple marks on my pillow case by the end of the week, but they wash right out. That is why 4 vs 5 stars.</li>
    <li> THE BEST PART IS THAT THERE IS NO CHEMICAL SMELL!!!  The best mask I ever had!!!  Soft to touch and light weight.</li>
    <li> I sleep late mid day to early A.M. I got these yesterday and slept in themt. They are great. Not hot and the adjustment clip never bothered me. I was concerned it might, but it did not. I recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good product.works great</li>
    <li> This is adjustable, fits perfectly, it&#x27;s comfortable and it works. I have a large head.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  I ordered 2 others that were more expensive but this one was the best. Total light blockage. The others leaked too much light around the nose area!</li>
    <li> I no longer have to put a blanket over my head when I am trying to sleep during the day to cover the sunlight! This fixed my issue because when I slept with a blanket over my head, though it did block out light, I had problems breathing fresh air. Now I can finally sleep comfortably during the day! The mask is very soft. I do wake up without it sometimes for some reason tho.. haha</li>
    <li> Needed a light weight comfortable mask to keep out light and shield eyes from dry out from use of our ceiling fan. This mask did it all. I thought I would need time to get used to it but I slept well the first night. The no odor was indeed an added plus. The ability to adjust the strap further enhanced comfort.</li>
    <li> best buy i love this  mask it feels so good .would recommend this for everyone .</li>
    <li> This is an OK sleep mask. The material is synthetic and soft like rayon. The mask is lightly padded. The head band is firm elastic that is adjustable. The adjustment is a metal ring like the kind found with pre-made bow ties. The mask is flat on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of trouble fully blocking out light with this mask. If you are looking for a complete total 100% pitch black, can&#x27;t see any light anywhere mask, this is probably not the one for you. The only way I could get it to totally block out light was to make it so tight I had to close my eyes. That might work fine for a lot of people. Adjusting the head band was not terribly easy. That isn&#x27;t a great big deal since once you adjust it for you head, it pretty much won&#x27;t ever change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
    <li> I received this mask as a review sample. Unlike some products many of the crop of sleep masks have different characteristics and boil down to personal preference. This one is well made and effective, and has some distinctive features on its own that you may want to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s thicker than any of the half dozen or so that I have tested. That, combined with a fairly generic, but effective adjustment strap make this one very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the coverage area on this one is about the same as on other masks I have used. Unlike some, though, this one does not have a &#x27;flap&#x27; that helps to seal out light. I tested this one over the course of three days, most of the time in the daylight hours since I tend to keep vampire hours. It did not let light in, so the absence of the flap is not an issue - and most brands do not come with the flap anyway. It definitely stays in place and is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final note: Because it&#x27;s silk you need to be careful with how you clean it. You definitely do NOT want to toss this into a washing machine. One way is to have it professionally dry-cleaned, but I am not sure this is the best route because out of the bag this mask has zero odors. That is fairly remarkable in itself. I did a test hand wash with a tiny amount of Woolite and warm water and it did not diminish the black dye nor harm the shape.</li>
    <li> Comfy but no washing instructions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft &amp; comfortable ~ I may purchase another one for my husband.</li>
