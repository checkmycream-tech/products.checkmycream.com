      <li>This wig is amazing.</li>
      <li>super great</li>
      <li>Although it looks a bit shiny but the color is beautiful and it fits me very well.</li>
      <li>Style wise, it&#x27;s not bad, it does mimic what&#x27;s shown in the picture.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and thought, &amp;#34; Okay, it&#x27;ll be a good wig.&amp;#34; Best wig I have ever had, hands down.</li>
      <li>Love the color, style, and length.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a blond-ish brown than an auburn.</li>
      <li>anti static comb etc...</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty thrilled!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s okay..</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>I will be mostly using it for display</li>
      <li>I love the hair.</li>
      <li>I have paid much more than this for Halloween wigs that were hideous by comparison.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>It is very red, although it&#x27;s still beautiful.</li>
      <li>Super cute it&#x27;s.</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;ll have it looking more like real hair than it already looks!</li>
      <li>I loved it, it almost looks like real human hair.  </li>
      <li>No heat, mild shampoo,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit thin, shed a lot when it came out, the fitting isn&#x27;t great but it stays where it should.</li>
      <li>Not really bad over all, I got what I paid for, so I really don&#x27;t have a right to complain.</li>
      <li>The color matches the picture exactly and it arrived almost 3 weeks ahead of schedule.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the color showed in the picture, it&#x27;s more of an ashy-brown.</li>
      <li>It has a pretty nice texture, not too shiny, added a little dry shampoo to give it a more realistic look.</li>
      <li>The wig was very inexpensive and I will probably use it if I ever need to dress up for Halloween.  </li>
      <li>but it looks real and feels very soft!</li>
      <li>This looked like real hair (after a little styling) and it was very natural-looking and elegant.</li>
      <li>Have to be careful with it because it came tangle easily.....</li>
      <li>The hair is very soft too..</li>
      <li>Color was brown, but looked and felt higher quality that I expected at the price.  </li>
      <li>but it looks great super easy to wear but didn&#x27;t have a wig cap in it so disappointed and tangles a little bit only reason for the 4 stars other than that</li>
      <li>Had to do a little trimming to the bangs, but overall fantastic purchase.</li>
      <li>I was shocked at how realistic and nice this wig was for under $10.</li>

<li> but I&#x27;ll  trim them down and soften them up.</li>
<li> A little bit of playing with it</li>
<li> For less than $20 it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
<li> Hair had a lot of curls at the bottom and bangs were blunt and thick.</li>
<li> It looks fake.</li>
<li> It did tangle a bit throughout the day but not so bad that it was a problem.</li>

    <li> Love the color, style, and length. Have to be careful with it because it came tangle easily.....but I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the hair. Although it looks a bit shiny but the color is beautiful and it fits me very well. The hair is very soft too..I just brush it using my fingers very gently and slowly. I&#x27;m very happy with the item. It also comes with one hair cap. I would buy from the seller again.</li>
    <li> The wig came in no time! I&#x27;m very happy with the Quality of the wig that this company gave too me.</li>
    <li> Good Quality. Love it.</li>
    <li> It is amazing! Its cheap but it looks real and feels very soft!</li>
    <li> Color is darker..came tangled..and there&#x27;s no head cap..but it&#x27;s okay..gotta use it once</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how realistic and nice this wig was for under $10. I have paid much more than this for Halloween wigs that were hideous by comparison. This looked like real hair (after a little styling) and it was very natural-looking and elegant. It was for a renaissance festival so I don&#x27;t plan on wearing it multiple times but it suited the purpose well. It did tangle a bit throughout the day but not so bad that it was a problem. Great purchase overall.</li>
    <li> Super cute it&#x27;s. Darker brown than a light brown but it looks great super easy to wear but didn&#x27;t have a wig cap in it so disappointed and tangles a little bit only reason for the 4 stars other than that super great P.s I straightened it and cut bangs don&#x27;t straighten</li>
    <li> beautiful fit super fast shipping feels natural on</li>
    <li> Great wig.  Color was brown, but looked and felt higher quality that I expected at the price.  Had to do a little trimming to the bangs, but overall fantastic purchase.</li>
    <li> Very cute,used for Halloween ,probably not for everyday use</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing. I read the reviews and thought, &amp;#34; Okay, it&#x27;ll be a good wig.&amp;#34; Best wig I have ever had, hands down. It shipped way sooner than I expected it to: I was told between Sept 26 and Oct 12, but Sept 8 it was in my mail box! It is very red, although it&#x27;s still beautiful. I was expecting more of a blond-ish brown than an auburn. But hey, it works great with my ideas and, like many others have said, it&#x27;s flattering on anyone! The bangs are a teensy bit long and when styled they poke me in the eyes (ow!), but I&#x27;ll  trim them down and soften them up. A little bit of playing with it and I&#x27;ll have it looking more like real hair than it already looks!</li>
    <li> Bought this and I&#x27;m pretty thrilled! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how it only came with a hair net, not a wig cap..</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought  it would  be</li>
    <li> Fun to wear on the weekends!</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig about 2 weeks ago and am very pleased with my purchase! It is synthetic hair, and as such, it has specific care instructions. No heat, mild shampoo, anti static comb etc... I think the length lets it tangle easier than say a shoulder or mid length wig, but you&#x27;ll find that with any synthetic hair. The color matches the picture exactly and it arrived almost 3 weeks ahead of schedule. For less than $20 it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not the color showed in the picture, it&#x27;s more of an ashy-brown. Style wise, it&#x27;s not bad, it does mimic what&#x27;s shown in the picture. It&#x27;s a bit thin, shed a lot when it came out, the fitting isn&#x27;t great but it stays where it should. Curls have fallen out a bit since wearing it, but I&#x27;m not really all to heart-broken about it. It has a pretty nice texture, not too shiny, added a little dry shampoo to give it a more realistic look. Not really bad over all, I got what I paid for, so I really don&#x27;t have a right to complain. Once I figure out how to upload pics, I will.</li>
    <li> The wig was very inexpensive and I will probably use it if I ever need to dress up for Halloween.  It looks fake.</li>
    <li> Wig was similar to pic but not the same as shown. Hair had a lot of curls at the bottom and bangs were blunt and thick. Ended up selling it.</li>
    <li> I loved it, it almost looks like real human hair.  I will be mostly using it for display so i&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
