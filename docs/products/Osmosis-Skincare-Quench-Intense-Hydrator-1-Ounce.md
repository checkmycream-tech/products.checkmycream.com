    <li> Love this line been using for 3 yrs I use the renew serum and replenish repair serum along with this daily will purchase again great price!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have been using this line for a while and really like them. I use this with the &#x27;Replenish&#x27; serum.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t oily at all which is perfect for oily skin types like me and it leaves skin nice and moisturized!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and rosacea and this is by far my favorite moisturizer. It&#x27;s pricey but worth it to me as I have finally found something that works without feeling oily or making my face break out. I have gotten so many complements on how smooth my skin looks since using this product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is priced pretty high, but the smell is divine (think lemonade with a less tart scent). Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t offer sun protection so I have to have another as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It keeps my facial skin moisturized like no other seems to.  I recommend it highly as well as the seller.</li>
    <li> I must first admit that I meant to order Immerse by the same company.  That product keeps my skin moist in our dry Montana climate and is great under makeup.  Somehow I got this instead but seemed to be my mistake. Must have pushed the wrong button and didn&#x27;t review my order carefully. Thus cannot return. An expensive mistake.  This product is horrible.  It is drying and smells like petroleum.  Maybe it is supposed to be that way for people with oily skin but Hydrator suggests moisturizing and this does not moisturize.  Can&#x27;t stand the smell either.</li>
    <li> This the best hydrator and skin conditioner I have ever used.  Been using it for well over a year and will definitely continue.  It can be mixed with any other serum  or repair cream and just is the best moisturizer ever</li>
    <li> I tired and tried and Osmosis is the best brand I have tried 44 yrs Young</li>
    <li> Very light, absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face moisturizer ever. It is light weight and leaves your skin soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Light and moisturizing without feeling like a heavy hydrator.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product 2 wks ago and have yet to receive it - not promised for another 2 wks.  I will not purchase from this supplier again as it takes too long to travel across two states.  If a realistic ship-arrival date had been provided, I would not have ordered.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. It is so hydrating but light weight and doesnt clog pores. Perfect for my combination skin. Love It.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  Does what it says it will do -- moisturize!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel all greasy or cause breakouts. It goes on well and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hydrator.  Plus, you don&#x27;t need very much of it.  Only draw back is such small bottles, but I find that with so many of the face poroducts.</li>
    <li> My aestetician introduced me to this line. It works really well for me. My skin is hydrated all day long!</li>
