<li> My little ones rash was gone in a matter of days, like completely vanished!</li>
<li> I was unable to find it anywhere local and my pharmacy couldn&#x27;t special order it</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very creamy and won&#x27;t burn when applied to delicate skin.  </li>
<li> We use it for just about everything - athletes foot, cracked skin, burns, dry skin, bug bites...  </li>

<li> One thing to note, and when your baby gets relief it is of no consequence IMO, but the pink color WILL stain clothing and bedding.  </li>

<li> just wasn&#x27;t going to work, and didn&#x27;t work even when I buckled down and tried it.  </li>
<li> Both my kids have extensive food allergies and get bad diaper rashes when we retest them or find a new sensitivity to something.  </li>
<li> Seems to work every well - very thick and will stay for a long time.  </li>

<li> When I had my first little one we went crazy trying to find something that worked for a nasty diaper rash that started after a round of antibiotics.</li>
<li> Works so well for hard to treat diaper rash!</li>
<li> This saved my son who got awful diarrhea and diaper rash as a result of being on antibiotics throughout his first year (yay for ear infections).  </li>
<li> the poor things inherited from me</li>
<li> I turned to the internet to try and find something else because I knew I couldn&#x27;t have possibly exhausted my options.</li>

<li> I recently ran out after my son had an antibiotic and he got a horrible rash.  </li>
<li> I was buying a prescription form my sons very bad rashes and the pediatrician recommended this one...</li>
<li> It is miracle serum that helps prevent /heal the worst rashes!</li>

    <li> Works so well for hard to treat diaper rash!</li>
    <li> No other diaper cream would heal my baby&#x27;s bottom.  This cream is a miracle worker.  Place it on her bottom at night and by morning her bottom has cleared up.  Give stars on this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! When I had my first little one we went crazy trying to find something that worked for a nasty diaper rash that started after a round of antibiotics. We tried it all, desitin, butt paste, calmoseptine, you name it we tried it and nothing worked. I turned to the internet to try and find something else because I knew I couldn&#x27;t have possibly exhausted my options. I came across Pinxav on a momma blog and she absolutely raved about it. I was unable to find it anywhere local and my pharmacy couldn&#x27;t special order it so that was a drag. Considering it was a bit costly to order and have shipped I first contacted the company directly and asked for some samples. They were more than happy to send some and it was practically overnighted to my house. Let me just say that this product is worth its weight in gold! My little ones rash was gone in a matter of days, like completely vanished! It only took that long because it was a serious rash triggered by diarrhea from antibiotics , smaller rashes are gone in a day! I use this on everything now, from burns to bites and it always does the trick. I purchased these 3 tubes so I have one everywhere. They will last FOREVER as a little goes a long way! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended. This is one of my go to gifts for first time moms as well.</li>
    <li> Best diaper cream ever! And I&#x27;ve tried them all!!</li>
    <li> Slightly thicker than Desitin, I think it seems to work a little better.  We&#x27;re pretty preemptive with the cream, so rashes rarely even start to develop.  The cream is pink, so it freaked me out the first time I saw a giant pink smear in the diaper.  But that&#x27;s mostly because I&#x27;m an idiot and forgot that I had used it.</li>
    <li> This works on diaper rash when nothing else will.  I recently ran out after my son had an antibiotic and he got a horrible rash.  Fortunately, this shipped pretty fast.  I buy the 3 pack and try to remember to keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  Will continue to purchase over and over.  We use it for just about everything - athletes foot, cracked skin, burns, dry skin, bug bites...  After 3 of my own children and 1 grandson its the BEST we have found for diaper rash.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that instantly cures diaper rash. Tried all the other products out there but this is the best!</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  It&#x27;s very creamy and won&#x27;t burn when applied to delicate skin.  For severe diaper rash it&#x27;s best to apply very thick and liberally.  Works beautifully every time!</li>
    <li> Recommended by our pediatrician. Smells better than most creams. Goes on easier than most high zinc creams.</li>
    <li> This stuff works,  like nothing I have ever used! It is miracle serum that helps prevent /heal the worst rashes! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My favorite rash cream. Clears things up fast!!</li>
    <li> The best cream ive ever used! Works on just about anything. Diaper rash disappeared within hours. Bug bites, burns, rashes, and more. Smells fresh...but looks really pink when applied.</li>
    <li> Best diaper rash product to prevent and heal irritated babies tender bottoms</li>
    <li> In the diaper rash world, you just sort of have to keep trying until you find one that works.  I don&#x27;t know about you but keeping my son naked on the floor to let air get to his skin just wasn&#x27;t going to work, and didn&#x27;t work even when I buckled down and tried it.  Poor baby&#x27;s butt burned every time he pooped and air wasn&#x27;t helping that.  AND newborns poop practically every 5 minutes.  Plus the problem really wasn&#x27;t excess moisture on the skin, it was the acidity of the poop.  No, we needed something to protect and soothe his skin!  I tried all of the Desitin formulas, the butt pastes, the homemade concoctions (several with and without cortisone cream, mylanta, etc), Aquaphor, Johnson&#x27;s professional moisture barrier (the kind they put on incontinent adults usually bedridden) and several others.  Pinxav was the last one we tried and (voila!) the one that finally worked.  We use it to this day on my 26 month old and now 14 month son&#x27;s diaper rashes.  Now when we use it as a preventative (their skin just gets &amp;#34;that look&amp;#34;) the rash doesn&#x27;t go much further.  My kids both have sensitive skin, a trait the poor things inherited from me I think, and eating certain foods makes their poop burn their skin. even now.  Highly recommend Pinxav.  One thing to note, and when your baby gets relief it is of no consequence IMO, but the pink color WILL stain clothing and bedding.  Usually I manage to get it off my fingers okay but using a wooden tongue depresser to spread it around helps, especially if you end up getting the king size tub of it like we did.  Also it smells strongly like cloves, and we have been asked more than once about it, so just be aware.</li>
    <li> Best. Diaper cream. EVER. This saved my son who got awful diarrhea and diaper rash as a result of being on antibiotics throughout his first year (yay for ear infections).  This is a standard gift for me to take to baby showers.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my grand-daughter &amp; luckily she hasn&#x27;t needed it again, but her little sister will be born later in the fall.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery from the seller.  This was recommended to me by my mother-in-law, who had it recommended from HER mother-in-law.  I&#x27;ve given it as shower gifts, and my daughters have asked for it when they move into their own homes.  Great healing properties, and fast acting!</li>
    <li> I was buying a prescription form my sons very bad rashes and the pediatrician recommended this one...I was paying over $50 for the Rx and now I save tons of money and my son is happy.</li>
    <li> Seems to work every well - very thick and will stay for a long time.  1 tube seems to last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a rash cream like this for 3 years.  Both my kids have extensive food allergies and get bad diaper rashes when we retest them or find a new sensitivity to something.  This is my go-to cream.  It works overnight to lessen the rash - like magic.  I&#x27;ve tried everything I could get my hands on and was lucky that a nanny I met gave me a tube of Pinxav.  I was instantly hooked.  I always keep 2 extra tubes on hand - one as a backup so I never run out and one to give away.</li>
    <li> We keep coming back for more - works great for our son and the doctor thought it was safe to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent diaper cream and my baby&#x27;s bum is sensitive!</li>
    <li> miracle cream. my grandson had a chemical burn from some baby wipes and was in alot of pain. This cream healed him in just one application</li>
