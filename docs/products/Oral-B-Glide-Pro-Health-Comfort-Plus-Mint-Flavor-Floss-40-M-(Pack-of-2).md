<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used. The floss is flat and covered with mint, which refreshes the mouth significantly. The form of the floss ensures that you don&#x27;t hurt your gums while flossing. This is all I&#x27;ll use for now....</li>
    <li> Good deal and quality product. Painless, soft and comfortable, never causes bleeding. I am hooked on this brand of floss. Never breaks down. I can floss my whole mouth effectively with only one small area on the floss, getting by using a shorter piece. Also, the dispenser works as smooth as silk. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Performs as expected.</li>
    <li> I love Glide. Much better than regular floss.</li>
    <li> My favorite dental floss.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite floss and I&#x27;m glad it comes in a 2 pack, so I can have one in the bathroom and one in my purse!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss because it doesn&#x27;t shred and it can comfortably reach even the tightest of spaces.</li>
    <li> Love this floss...easy between the teeth.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the only floss I will use now. I used to get pretty mad at floss that shredded while using it so I hardly ever flossed before. This stuff is perfect though, I buy it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love floss? Nah. LIke is OK. Do not break easily and fits between teeth well. Good value</li>
    <li> Works great just as I&#x27;ve come to expect from Glide.</li>
    <li> Seriously, how can someone love dental floss but this stuff is great.  I have arch wires behind my top and bottom teeth and have a heck of a time with the usual thin narrow floss.  BUT... with this stuff I can insert it under the wires, floss and don&#x27;t need one of those darned threader thingys.  For me it&#x27;s a great item and I use it every day!  Thanks Oral-B</li>
    <li> Very good quality floss. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I like glide floss.  Dentist says you have to be careful to pay attention as this will glide over plaque - as long as you know that you are good.</li>
    <li> Seems to be brittle... dried out... breaking easily compared to same product from store...</li>
    <li> Exactly what you need in dental floss - easy glide, minty fresh, and multiple packs to hide around the house so there&#x27;s no excuse not to floss!  I also set a calendar appt reminder everyday at 9:30 p.m. to keep flossing top of mind.  Easy choice, will reorder when the time is right.</li>
    <li> What more can you say about Glide floss. It makes flossing a much better experience. Glides in between your teeth easily with a minty taste. I can&#x27;t floss with anything else.</li>
    <li> This Glide must be a defective batch; it breaks easily and shreds easily.</li>
    <li> Keeps me and the dentist happy.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, it works great! It&#x27;s much easier on the gums than string floss. The flavor is there, but doesn&#x27;t really make much a difference.</li>
    <li> I prefer this floss over any regular floss; This floss gets even in the smallest of spaces. My teeth are very tight and regular floss sometimes gets stuck and then it is a hassle to get the stuck floss back out. This floss never gets stuck. Great floss - highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great floss, works well.  I sometimes have a problem with floss not moving smoothly through the teeth, or getting stuck.  Not with this one.</li>
    <li> If you gotta floss (which we all do), do it with a good product like this.</li>
    <li> I found it funny how this came in a box much larger than it needed.</li>
    <li> Good dental floss, gets out those tough to extricate little food bits.  It&#x27;s wider than most floss so I like it for that reason. It does have a minty flavor that I could do without, but it does make your mouth feel fresher after you floss.</li>
    <li> i have always liked Glide and it was one of the few floss products that would easily move between my tight teeth. This, for some reason, snaps after the first or second tooth. Not sure if I got an old or faulty batch or if the mint version somehow weakens the floss itself (which of course, makes it pointless). Very disappointed, and of course this was the one time I choice to &amp;#34;stock up&amp;#34; 😑</li>
    <li> Great great design for floss. The soft matte dispenser feels comforting to touch. The string is crazy strong, yet it doesn&#x27;t cut my gums at all.</li>
    <li> Favorite dental floss ever. It holds together, and gets into those tight spots between my teeth. The flavor is nice, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I prefer these... thick ribbon tape instead of string.  works/tastes best</li>
    <li> Not overly minty or waxy. Does what it is expected.</li>
    <li> This floss is great at getting into teeth because it is thin and tape shaped versus string.  At the same time, because it is so thin it does rip especially for sharp teeth or if removing at an angle.</li>
    <li> I once asked my dental hygienist which dental floss she recommended. She said, &amp;#34;The one that you will use.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different dental floss brands and types, and this is my favorite. My teeth are very close to each other and it is hard to find a floss that will go between them and also not feel like I am pulling out a tooth when I try to remove it. I use this every day and love it. The minty freshness is a bonus, though I do wonder what they used to get it minty tasting.</li>
    <li> Great floss for tight spots and aging gums too.</li>
    <li> My favorite floss.  It goes easily through my teeth.  My teeth are very tight and these go thru easily and don&#x27;t shred. I have bought others in the past and had such a hard time getting the floss out of my teeth not with these been using them for a year or more and very very pleased with how they work.</li>
    <li> One of the floss containers was broken</li>
    <li> It flosses my teeth, doesn&#x27;t hurt. This is the ribbon type, not the rope type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Effective, easy to use, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Nice product to have.</li>
    <li> I was never a big flosser growing up...it&#x27;s time consuming, it can be painful, and my big hands combined with small mouth is similar to moving couch into a bathroom. But this floss is softer and wider, which makes it more comfortable and more effective!</li>
    <li> This is the best floss out there. I grew up with Dentists in the family and spent over 8 years in braces, let&#x27;s just say my teeth were jacked up. Now, they sit a little tight but this floss is GREAT and allows me to get between my teeth without the floss BREAKING and leaving strands of floss between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great stuff... this is all I buy now. I have 4 extra laying around.</li>
    <li> The examples I&#x27;ve received are so heavily waxed that the tape is difficult or impossible to get out of the container  With the first sample, I was able to get the tape started with a pliers and managed to use the whole roll by pulling out an extra couple of inches which I left on the roll as a &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; for the next piece.  With the second sample, the tape was so waxed that it broke before I could get enough out to use.  I will not buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using this floss for the last several years. For me - and my teeth - this floss is more comfortable when getting into the hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time and has a very pleasant mint taste.</li>
    <li> I think this floss is okay... When using it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my teeth feel cleaner than before I used it. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they are rougher in texture when moving them across the teeth giving me the impression that it&#x27;s scraping away the debris. This floss doesn&#x27;t give me that impression. It&#x27;s too smooth. It is easy on gums though which is nice if you have sensitive gums for whatever reason.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break into small pieces (hence the &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; in the name) and isn&#x27;t too thick that it makes my gums bleed. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Great add on purchase.  I don&#x27;t always remember to get this at the store so Amazon will bring it to your door.</li>
    <li> It is good to get in the habit of flossing especially when it helps save your teeth.  Now that I&#x27;m older [mid sixties], grateful to have my own teeth.</li>
    <li> I buy this floss all the time. But this smells weird. It smells old. Like musty....</li>
    <li> My favorite floss.  I keep getting the off brand at the store and it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
    <li> Thick but easy to slip inbetween teeth.  Does outstanding job.</li>
    <li> We like this flosss because of it&#x27;s flavor and it&#x27;s a two pack so me and my husband both have one.</li>
    <li> Love this Glide floss.  This is the only dental floss that I can use that doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my teeth!</li>
    <li> My favorite dental floss! My teeth are all impacted, so flossing can be a nightmare with other floss. This brand is the very, very best!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite floss. It is the most gentle on my gums and gets out the most food particles. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was nicely surprised by this floss and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off, this twin pack is a good deal with the Add-on shipping program. A decent total length of floss for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss itself is tape-style floss; the material is thin so it easily gets between tight teeth, but the floss is wide so it comes in to contact with a larger area of the tooth making it seem to be more efficient then the little string type floss. I think it cleans my teeth very well, and it does have a nice minty taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This floss is made from a very soft material and that, combined with the tape-style width, makes it very easy to handle. One of the things that bugs me about the thin type of floss is that it gets so tight around my finger (sometimes seemingly cutting off circulation). This floss does not have that issue at all! It is very soft and only needs to be wrapped around the finger a couple tikes, and it stays put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had braces years ago, but lost my retainer a decade or so ago. While my teeth are still nicely lined up, a few of them have moved so closely together that standard floss gets shredded every time I use it. Not this tough stuff! I have used this floss for a month or so now, and have not had a single strand fray, split or break on me. Given my track record, that is impressive to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, I like this and will purchase it again. If you are searching for a new floss and want to try this style, go for it. Think you will be just as pleasantly surprised as i was.</li>
    <li> Constantly breaks apart while flossing; the quality seems to have substantially dropped based on recent purchases.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like.  It&#x27;s floss at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is indeed comfortable and gentle on the gum but YOU CAN&#x27;T IGNORE OTHER PROBLEMS!!!&lt;br /&gt;It does not clean your teeth as well as the Reach floss does. There was a period of time when I used this floss every night and still got gum problems. Now I&#x27;ve switched to Reach, which is way more effective in terms of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it easily breaks and gets stuck (the container is problematic).</li>
    <li> Works very well, gets into my tight teeth where others have fail or get stuck.</li>
    <li> Does not easily break! Lives up to its name.</li>
    <li> the only floss i would ever use. leaves no waxy residue and doesnt stretch, preventing that snapping motion when you get between tight teeth.</li>
    <li> Only floss that doesn&#x27;t hang up in my teeth around fillings.  This stuff is the best.</li>
    <li> the only floss we will use in our house!</li>
    <li> Good, thick.  Not as strong as it used to be: breaks when going around implants.</li>
    <li> I like this item better than store brands. I can use less per use than cheep ones. A good price.</li>
    <li> Better for teeth than even a waterpik.</li>
    <li> Same story along with tooth paste !.</li>
    <li> it is so comfortable,the floss is 2mm width</li>
    <li> Works as intended. Doesn&#x27;t get stuck between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Cleans pretty well.  Better than most brands.</li>
    <li> This floss is so smooth and glides right through my really tricky spots. I love that it&#x27;s minty fresh, and that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the little hairs from the other kind splintering or being caught in my tight areas in my teeth. I like that it&#x27;s a two pack too because I can keep one at home and bring one in my travel bag. I floss each night, or after eating sticky meals like meat or broccoli and things - and this floss always seems to get in all the right spots to get everything out. Glides in and out perfectly smooth between all teeth.</li>
    <li> This satin type floss is my favorite, good stuff.</li>
    <li> Awesome floss. The only kind I use. It&#x27;s not too thin so it won&#x27;t hurt fingers but does a great job cleaning.</li>
    <li> Very durable and efficient floss. It makes my mouth feel very clean!</li>
    <li> Great product for oral hygiene!  Easy to use &amp; your mouth feels clean &amp; fresh after using it.  Highly recommended for care of your gums &amp; teeth.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, easy on the teeth, and with a mint-tasting outer layer -- I buy no other flosses.</li>
    <li> Works well, arrived quickly.  What is not to like?</li>
    <li> great came just as promised and works like you get from store.</li>
    <li> Product is thin enough to slip in between tight spaces between teeth.  Relatively strong, but can be broken by sharp edged teeth - though not as quickly as some brands.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite floss.  Its thin and slides in nicely.  I have tight teeth so this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Minty Floss! This product is very helpful, for helping keep my teeth and gums healthy. I have had no problems with tearing or anything and I have braces. This floss is thin, waxy and smooth. It does it&#x27;s job well and for 2 sets of it for it&#x27;s price, I definetly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The only floss I trust and use on my busted up grill.</li>
    <li> Best floss on the market!</li>
    <li> Gentle on the teeth with just the right hint of mint.  Double pack at an excellent price.  Easier on the teeth than typical wax floss and better than competitors with similar products.  Best floss I have ever used.  Still cavity free!!!</li>
    <li> As someone who has put off regular dental care for waaaaayyy too long my recent and actual forays into the dentist have shown that I had to pay the piper.  While at the dentist office I was asked multiple times, in an effort to shame me I suppose, how often I flossed.  I didn&#x27;t even bother to lie and replied with an honest &amp;#34;0&amp;#34;.  The look of exasperations told me that obviously I was deserving of all the cavities I had accumulated.  So now, as I do wish to keep my teeth, I am finally joining the flossing ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first flossing product I ordered as the ancient string floss I had in my medicine cabinet seemed suspect.  I have never been a fan of flossing as my teeth are very close together and it is difficult to get floss through.  I can say this product is true to itself in that it actually does get through the spaces in my teeth and doesn&#x27;t snag or break, which I have experienced before.  The slight minty taste is subtle and not overtly waxy.  So all in all I now begrudgingly floss my teeth at night and am trying hard to stick to my new routine.  I gave 4 stars because I still don&#x27;t like flossing but that&#x27;s not poor Oral-B&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> this is a hard to find product - and I was so glad to find it on amazon. the floss is a tape type - not a string - so it slides easy with minimal effort and no pain. if you have tender gums and teeth that fit close together then this is the type of floss you won&#x27;t mind using.</li>
    <li> Like regular floss better -- doesn&#x27;t seem to do as good a job as regular floss</li>
    <li> good taste ,more useful,i want to but it again</li>
    <li> I loooove this floss. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Glides easily through my teeth. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pleasure to use. So much better than the thin thread-like floss. The thick width of this floss really gets into the gum line. I was given some of this at the dentist&#x27;s office and stores in my area were out of stock. I&#x27;m purchasing it again here on Amazon when I run out. Nice minty flavor and  a great value too!</li>
    <li> Best floss ever. I have tight teeth so I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t shred.</li>
    <li> Glide does not break off while flossing, Glide does the job I purchased it for.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Works well in the process of flossing.  Glide does a&lt;br /&gt;nice job.</li>
    <li> My go to dental floss. Smooth as silk</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how this feels - it&#x27;s really smooth and just doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; the way regular floss does. Maybe it&#x27;s just me...</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of floss and for me this is the best floss available.  It does not fray and leave threads between your teeth as some do.  and as an add-on was very economical.</li>
    <li> I hated flossing because the floss always felt like it was grinding against my teeth and gums while leaving an artificial residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought this product. The floss feels much smoother and lighter on the gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like something out of a TV commercial--for a few dollars more, you too can make flossing a slightly more enjoyable experience!</li>
    <li> I have major problems with floss breaking between my teeth. Glide is the first floss that doesn&#x27;t brake.. or I should say rarely breaks because it does happen occasionally. But it&#x27;s miles better than any other on the market. It is very smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my gums like others do. The taste is fine. I thought maybe the satin floss from another brand would be better (the packaging looked nice ha) but it&#x27;s not good at all. Glide is where it&#x27;s at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the case.. it&#x27;s easy to open and snap a piece. Some packages of floss roll back into the container or break too easily. I&#x27;ve had zero trouble with Glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to get more items online rather than locally and this is one of them that turned out to be priced right.</li>
    <li> awesome gets all the crap i dont want in my teeth</li>
    <li> Best floss there is. Wish I could find it unscented.</li>
    <li> a little pricey, but this is my favorite floss</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a convert to the Glide product line.  I like the way that it moves between my teeth, cleans easily, doesn&#x27;t cut into my gums, and does not shred like some some other floss products.</li>
    <li> Smooth and thin, but yet doesn&#x27;t break apart. The Glide brand is the best floss around, hands down. I bulk order them as to not run out.</li>
    <li> I posted a review about the &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; floss as well. If you use Glide because your teeth are very tight together like I do, stick to regular Glide in the white packaging. This stuff breaks way too easily. The green box is slightly better than the &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; in the grey one, but I still have to be very careful not to snap the floss when I use it.</li>
    <li> These are great at really getting your mouth clean without snagging on any fillings.  They leave your mouth feeling nice and rush and the wide string is more gentle on your gums.</li>
    <li> The best floss out there</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty regular about flossing, and I usually like Oral B Glide.  I found that this floss consistently broke whenever I tried to really clean my teeth.  I tried flossing more gently for a few days, but then I noticed plaque building up.  I switched to another brand.  I&#x27;ve never seen floss snap so easily.  Perhaps that&#x27;s part of the &amp;#34;Comfort Plus&amp;#34; feature.  Serious flossers beware.</li>
    <li> My husband refuses to use any other brand or kind of floss after using this.</li>
    <li> This works really great for me.  I had only used the thinner thread-like products in the past.</li>
    <li> Always buy Glide floss, because they easily go in between teeth.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t rip, doesn&#x27;t fray, doesn&#x27;t get stuck. Glides and slides and cleans perfect without hurting gums. Ideal for us!</li>
    <li> I have tight teeth and this has been some of the best floss to help.  It does not shred, although it can be a bit slick to grip, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about pieces of it coming off and getting stuck between my teeth or threads.  It&#x27;s more than your basic transportation but if you have tight spacing it&#x27;s totally worth the extra cost</li>
    <li> Best floss out there!! I am in love with it. My teeth are tightly close together so flossing was always an issue but now I don&#x27;t worry about my floss breaking ir getting stuck in my teeth</li>
    <li> Why would you buy anything else??? I have had dental work done, and I have had numerous name brand, expensive dental flosses get stuck (really stuck) between my teeth before. The last thing I want to do is pull out a crown while flossing; I don&#x27;t have that worry with Oral-B Glide.</li>
    <li> Nice floss!! Not too thick!</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price! Just about as expected, cant go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Works with hand as well as clippers, does the job.</li>
    <li> This dental floss works great if your teeth are tightly spaced.  Minty flavor is nice too.  Subscribe and save is convenient and a good price.</li>
    <li> Our entire family has been enjoying this dental-floss for the past few years. It is easy to use, does not injure our guns and has a pleasant flavor. I just wish it were a little stronger: in order for it not to tear one has to be a little gentle with it.</li>
    <li> Great to clean your teeth.  Buy it and keep it in your car or keep it in your travel bag.</li>
    <li> very good tasting.  does an excellent job.  almost no gum pain after using (I have very sensitive gums).  good price for home delivery</li>
    <li> Good floss; strong and pleasant tasting.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is a good width - not too thin, and has a slight minty taste which I like</li>
    <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve ever used.  Slides easily between close teeth, doesn&#x27;t pop down in making my gums bleed.</li>
    <li> Product works as intended.  I can get it to glide between my teeth without problems.</li>
    <li> Glide has been the only floss I can stand to use (others shred, and require too much force to get between my teeth). They&#x27;ve had a unique product and been able to charge a premium. Looks like that&#x27;s been giving way ... found an equivalent at the Dollar Store recently. The price Amazon is showing currently is deeply discounted, but still not quite as cheap as the generic ... $1 for 25m.</li>
    <li> Works great. Great for $4</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this floss.  It is thick enough to clean between your teeth and does &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; through per its name.  Will definitely purchase again.  Also, we love the mint!</li>
    <li> Everyone should use this every day. Dentist told me that this is the most effective way to protect the gum. Believe it, it IS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are mint flavor, very nice. Strong and easy to use. I don&#x27;t have the break problem, actually it is kinda hard to break the floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, use it everyday!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt the gum. I love it.</li>
    <li> Regular floss will shred and get caught between my teeth as they are so tight. This type of floss is like a fine tape. It will glide between the tightest spaces and does a thorough job of cleaning. I would not use any other type of floss and would recommend it to any one but especially those who have trouble with regular floss shredding.</li>
    <li> It does not get stuck in between the teeth while flossing.  It glides smoothly beteween the teeth and cleans impeccably, leaving a feeling of cleanliness..</li>
    <li> Great product! Good for tight teeth which can be difficult to floss around. I use this as an accompaniment to my dental picks as they cannot get up around the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Tends to break, but otherwise I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> My husband like this floss. I still prefer the regular waxed.</li>
    <li> I really like this floss.  It slips in between tight teeth well and is easy to handle when flossing.  There is not a lot to say - it&#x27;s floss!  The mint taste is not overpowering, in fact you can barely detect it which is how I like my mint floss...if you want a very strong mint flavor though, I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable. Love it.</li>
    <li> I only use Glide. All other flosses seem to break or cut into my gums.</li>
    <li> Great floss. It is smooth and fits easily between my teeth, even the couple of teeth that are a little too close together. I also find that this floss picks up plaque really well. I just slide the floss forward while I&#x27;m getting in between my teeth, and the plaque comes out really well. I will keep buying using Subscribe &amp; Save. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how people use dental tape.  This stuff works great and tastes great too.</li>
    <li> I have used the following brands (or their generics): Gum, and Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach.  Oral-B Glide floss (or a similar store brand/generic version) is the best.  It is a ribbon that slides/glides easily between my teeth.  Some of my lower teeth are very close together, but Glide does the job on those teeth perfectly.  So, my gums don&#x27;t bleed, the floss does not get stuck/break in my teeth, it does not fray, and I can spend time actually FLOSSING (i.e., gently working the floss back/forth between my teeth to remove debris).  Since it does not fray or break, I end up using less floss.  Now I enjoy flossing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE COMPETITION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gum floss was thin.  It not only frayed quickly, but broken in my teeth right away.  I tried regular Gum floss, not the butter-weave version.  The labeling on both versions of Gum floss make the same claims: strong, slides easily between tightly spaced teeth.  Not true...not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach is a thicker floss, it was difficult to get between some of my teeth, it also frayed after flossing a few teeth; and when it broke, it was uncomfortable and difficult to remove from between my teeth.  I have used Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach in the past, because it was cheap.  However, I do NOT like it.  It did not encourage me to floss.  For some of my tightly spaced teeth, I hate having to put so much pressure on the floss to get it between my teeth...then as it gets forced between my teeth, it slices into my gums, and that hurts and causes bleeding.  And when I pull the floss back out, it feels like my tooth might come out with the floss (only applies to my tightly spaced teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Glide floss, I am able to purchase the Equate store brand (generic) at Wal-Mart; it sells for about 4 bucks for a two-pack; each item in the pack is 40m (43.7 yards) for a total of 80m (87.5 yards) for the whole pack.  In comparison, Gum was 3.50 for 200 yards, Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach was 1 buck for 50 yards, and the generic version of Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach was 1 buck for 100 yards.  In comparison to the other brands of floss, Glide is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t need to use as much Glide, because it doesn&#x27;t break or fray (and because it slides easier between my teeth, which means I don&#x27;t need to have a death grip on the floss itself).  Instead of needing about 18 inches of floss tightly wrapped around the fingers of both hands, about 12 inches of Glide works just fine for me.  So, using 1 foot per day at 87.5 yards means that one two-pack should last me almost 9 months. And that&#x27;s pretty good for 4 bucks!s, and the generic version of Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach was 1 buck for 100 yards.  In comparison to the other brands of floss, Glide is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t need to use as much Glide, because it doesn&#x27;t break or fray (and because it slides easier between my teeth, which means I don&#x27;t need to have a death grip on the floss itself).  Instead of needing about 18 inches of floss tightly wrapped around the fingers of both hands, about 12 inches of Glide works just fine for me.  So, using 1 foot per day at 87.5 yards means that one two-pack should last me almost 9 months. And that&#x27;s pretty good for 4 bucks!</li>
    <li> Delivered just as expected</li>
    <li> This is the only floss my daughter will use.</li>
    <li> Best floss ever.  Does not shred.</li>
    <li> A few words about this floss - very good, very nice, great service, thanks for sending it so quickly and keep flossing, it&#x27;s good for your teeth.</li>
    <li> Breaks too easily.  I wasted a lot of floss for one flossing.</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the best floss out there. The ribbon design really helps cover more surface area while providing some gentleness on your gums. I floss twice a day now and the bleeding is becoming better. Highly recommended and great value when you purchase for add-on price.</li>
    <li> This is the only dental floss that does not get stuck between my teeth and shred.  It has a ribbon consistency that &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; between teeth and cleans the gunk out.  This is the brand my dentist uses.</li>
    <li> Perfect one. Do not tear, do not stain parts in teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Has nice smell.</li>
    <li> Oral-B Glide is like a silk ribbon gliding through the tiny spaces between my teeth.  I have tried them all and this is the best.</li>
    <li> I like the Glide Floss, doesn&#x27;t stick to my teeth or shred and it&#x27;s minty! I guess my only slight negative is that it feels a bit sticky but that doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.</li>
    <li> This is pretty bad. It break all the time, even places that I have never seen other product breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a general fact, any &amp;#34;gliding&amp;#34; product will clean less. So the only positive is that it&#x27;s minty...</li>
    <li> The best floss. Does the job and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Really good floss. Thicker and stronger than typical floss, in a kind of flat, tape-like shape.</li>
    <li> The only floss I use. It really does glide between your teeth, and is thick enough not to get caught in jagged teeth/cut your gums to bits. Basically that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> ..that is very comfy to use!</li>
    <li> This product splits and breaks too easily. I was very happy with the plain glide floss of this brand, so I thought the mint version would be even better. For some reason this version of the floss tears very easily. The plain one didn&#x27;t. I wont buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Great product brand new and were shipped as promised I&#x27;m very satisfied. RECOMMENDED THIS ITEM!</li>
    <li> My favorite floss so far, very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This stuff works the best</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stick in my close teeth</li>
    <li> Love that they come in a small package so I can carry a pack with me where ever i go.  Strong and easy glide</li>
    <li> I have crowns.  The other type of floss, waxed/unwaxed string does not work for me.  This Glide - teflon kind, is a life saver.  If it was not for the crowns, and because of the price, I would use the other kind.</li>
    <li> With regard to smoothness of the floss, Glide is one of the best flosses I&#x27;ve used, especially compared to ye olde waxy floss. Unfortunately, some of my teeth are close together, making flossing between these teeth a tight squeeze. Here is where Glide fails as it breaks very easily. Whenever I floss with Glide, I have to take out at least two long strands to floss as the strands break, wasting a lost of floss. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with Colgate&#x27;s floss.</li>
    <li> I love it because it does not shred or break easily.</li>
    <li> Does what it suppose to.</li>
    <li> soft on your gum and minty!</li>
    <li> Most comfortable dental floss out there.  I have it on my Subscribe &amp; Save list now.</li>
    <li> very reasonable price..u cannt go wrong</li>
    <li> Bought a few of these for the family. Like the fact its a multi pack. Got tired of running to the store for such items. Good value without Too much shopping.</li>
    <li> I  am not sure exactly why, but this is the best floss I have ever used.  It does the job!  smoothly and effectively getting debris removed from in between tight spots.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> glide is the best dental floss.  It does not stick on teeth and seldom breaks.  I do not use anything else.  This 2 pack is a good deal. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite floss because it does not split into many threads when wedged in and out of my teeth.  It holds together perfectly.  I&#x27;ve tried other branded &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; like floss and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to stay together.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly for me. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
    <li> My fave kind of floss! Smooth, easy to use</li>
    <li> Great! As others have stated, this floss is more like a ribbon than the normal floss. This gives the floss a narrow edge and a little bit wider edge so you can insert the floss into very narrow spaces, but can still cover a wider area when flossing.</li>
    <li> Flossing is important, and this is a good floss!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s floss.  It flosses.</li>
    <li> Does its job and slides smoothly between teeth. Quick tip, just use a long line instead of trying to save up and using short lines. Long ones will be comfier than having your fingers in your mouth all the time.</li>
    <li> This floss is so AWESOME!! Everyone knows you&#x27;re supposed to floss. The dentist is always asking, Even my doctor asks now if I&#x27;m flossing, Apparently it&#x27;s one the predictors for a longer life: Those who floss regularly tend to live longer. Well, with this floss it is not a chore! It is a pleasure. It is so smooth and minty. It&#x27;s name is very apt because it does glide. Flossing is now something to look forward to.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss on the market period. Have tried them all and this one works the best.</li>
    <li> Other floss shreds in my teeth.  This works.</li>
    <li> I had braces so my teeth are really tight and this works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than all the other floss I used. It&#x27;s on the thicker side. It glides flawlessly and leaves a mild minty taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I encounter is whenever I use it on a tight area, it shreds then snaps. Doesn&#x27;t happen often but it can be a hassle. Although whenever it snaps, it doesn&#x27;t leave a piece in between the teeth like the ones I used before did, which can be really uncomfortable and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for a year now and it&#x27;s still the best floss for me out there. Out of around 10 of these that I used, around 2 of them had issues with the floss getting stuck inside. No amount of pulling helps. You&#x27;ll have to open it and untangle the floss inside so you can use it again.</li>
    <li> This brand works the best for me.  Not running out ever is pretty nice too.</li>
    <li> Perfect one. Do not tear, do not stain parts in teeth. Has nice smell.</li>
    <li> This floss is great - the &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; lets the floss get more surface area of a tooth, and it slides easily between your teeth.  Plus a minty flavor doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Great taste. Great quality and great price.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> This is a really good price for floss, particularly with the subscribe &amp; save option.  I&#x27;m a regular flosser and I have permanent retainers behind my teeth, so I need a strong floss for threading.  This one never frays and slides in and out easily.  It&#x27;s basically everything you could ask for in a floss.</li>
    <li> I already love the product, but the price was really good and I bought a large quantity so I won&#x27;t run out for a long time, will have plenty of time to order more.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use; smooth, effective.</li>
    <li> Glide is the only floss I can get between my teeth because they&#x27;re pretty close together. Any other floss shreds and breaks while I&#x27;m using it. Glide doesn&#x27;t. This was a great price for it, and I&#x27;ll always buy it from Amazon because it&#x27;s about 1/2 the price of elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Only floss that doesn&#x27;t break for me when getting my back molars! Smooth and minty too, will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Excellent floss.  More shred resistance than other brands of floss that I have tried.  Just need a few more words...</li>
    <li> Flossing with the mint flavor makes flossing an enjoyable and rejuvenating experience.  Otherwise, I feel like I am just flossing.  Get the mint!</li>
    <li> I needed some dental phlox</li>
    <li> great product although it does smell a little funny.</li>
    <li> really comfy floss, doesn&#x27;t hurt gums</li>
    <li> Love this floss!  Works the best, love the mint, and well priced.</li>
    <li> This review will be simple.  Glide is great smooth floss that leaves my mouth feeling fresh.  This is much more comfortable to use than &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34; floss.</li>
    <li> This floss is horrible. I have used Glide for years. This stuff disintegrates about every fourth tooth. I have to reel off about 4 times the floss that I normally use. My wife looks at all the shards of mangled floss and says, &amp;#34;Lost another floss battle, huh?&amp;#34; Rediculous.</li>
    <li> One of the better flosses out there.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and relatively shred-[roof.</li>
    <li> if you have some tightly spaced teeth this is the best floss! silky smooth and fits any tight spaces. only downside is it does tear more easily than some other floss so if you have sharp edges, avoid working this floss around those spots.</li>
    <li> Always a good product.  Dentist says I should use something that will grab more plaque but my teeth are abnormally close together and tight to put regular floss.  This stuff never tears and gets inbetween my teeth.</li>
    <li> This floss really does &amp;#34;Glide&amp;#34; in between your teeth &amp; has a minty taste.  I am more used to the pick flossers so sometimes its tricky to use the string floss but this kind def makes it a little easier.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums either and I feel like it does a great job.</li>
    <li> This is the best flos I have ever used. Because its a tape instead of a line I hurt my gums much less. Its also more resistant, as floss often gets trapped between my teeth and this has not.</li>
    <li> Love how easily and effectively it glides.</li>
    <li> Looks kinda cheap... But does the job I guess</li>
    <li> Glide, Slide, Slippery and Slide!</li>
    <li> This floss isn&#x27;t flimsy and it does it&#x27;s job. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> the floss frequently gets stuff and unravels.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, on and off, including in the last few months, and I thought it was great, if a bit expensive. Mostly I use a local store brand that is similar, but more affordable. Lately that brand had started shredding on me. So I got some Glide and was really disappointed. Both quantity (from 50 m to 40 m) and quality have gone downhill. It doesn&#x27;t usually shred--it just breaks. Then the leftover piece is too short, so I have to use more. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Good prices on great floss.</li>
    <li> I expected way better since I regularly use the Glide original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version seems to be only 30% the strength and durability as the original Glide.  It shredded during use. The first incident I thought was maybe a manufacturing glitch, then continued with a fresh line, and that too shredded and broke.  Continued again, with a third, yup, that shredded.  It took 4 lines to do what the Glide original could accomplish.</li>
    <li> We normally get a different type of glide (satin?) and he says this one falls apart in his teeth compared to that one. I&#x27;ll be getting the other one from here on out.</li>
    <li> Great floss! I used to use reach waxed floss. It was always splitting and getting in my teeth. This is the most effective and I feel like it definitely gets the job done better than anything else.</li>
    <li> Great deal for a two pack of my favourite floss! Works well, threads through a permanent retainer.</li>
    <li> Strange tooth floss, kind of feels like thread seal tape like for plumbing. It&#x27;s strong and gets a lot of gunk out from between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Best floss on the market.</li>
    <li> So many mint flavored flosses are just over the top nasty; but, NOT this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mint is very subtle and the Glide brand remains our favorite with its Teflon smooth coating and super strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape is so much better than string and so much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only brand we buy and use!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s floss. It works. It does break a little bit easier that I would like otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I like it and buy it regularly</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
    <li> What can one say about floss, except we are encouraged by doctors/dentist to floss for better health. I particularly like Glide as it seems to work better than other flosses; easier to get and move between teeth.</li>
    <li> Do it every day so your mouth is happy! We like glide so it doesn&#x27;t get shredded by our tightly packed teeth.</li>
    <li> Get a bunch of these ...... they do a good job of flossing, convenient to have everywhere you want them !</li>
    <li> Breaks way too easy, Very thin product.</li>
    <li> The floss is exactly what I expect from the Glide line -- wide, nice &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;, slightly slick and tough to avoid getting stuck and/or ripping. Perfect.</li>
    <li> Much better than standard floss.  The Oral-B Glide floss is a bit thicker than standard floss so it cleans between teeth better it is also stronger so it does not break as often as standard floss</li>
    <li> Best floss I&#x27;ve ever had, flavor is just stuble enough to not be over whelming while pleasant enough to make flossing less unappealing, smooth enough to get between a couple of my teeth which have become nigh unassailable with normal floss since my dentist put fillings that all but connected my teeth together.  Because they slide through smoothly, I don&#x27;t get the pain from yanking other slide floss through into my gums, yet they still seem to adequately remove food and whatever else from the sides of my teeth and pockets of my gums.  They do still get cut up a bit between my teeth where the dentist made the filling edge extra sharp, but almost always manage to hold up enough that I can get in and out before they full break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, hard to see myself going back to any other floss after using this.</li>
    <li> Slides in between teeth easily and has a fresh mint taste.</li>
    <li> If you have some tightly spaced teeth this is the best floss! Silky smooth and fits any tight spaces. Only downside is it does tear more easily than some other floss so if you have sharp edges, avoid working this floss around those spots.</li>
    <li> great flavor. good product. very smooth. i love it</li>
    <li> Oral-B Glide has been changed so many times over the years - glad they still have the sense to make it.  Nothing worse if you get a piece of dental floss stuck between your teeth!  These get the job done!</li>
    <li> Best floss around.  Food sticks to it, it&#x27;s comfortable, and it tastes good.</li>
    <li> I like this floss because it&#x27;s flat and more like tape than floss. I find that shape/flatness to be more comfortable, more effective for flossing hard to reach back teeth, and also less likely to break or shred while flossing. This is the only floss I use.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  Could never do without this floss!</li>
    <li> Mint flavor is a little icky (dentist mint flavor). Will get plain next time. However the actual floss works really well and does not shred.</li>
    <li> Love this floss. I have sensitive teeth and tight contacts between my teeth, but this floss slides easily between my teeth and doesn&#x27;t tear up my gums.  I just it every day and have healthy gums that never bleed.</li>
    <li> I have used this floss for years and really like it.  It is easy to use, effective in cleaning the teeth, and the mint taste is very refreshing.  Buying it in the twin-pack makes it more affordable and it is always good to have an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; around.</li>
    <li> its the perfect pack and I love that I can subscribe and save. No need to remember to pick it  up at the store.</li>
    <li> Floss don&#x27;t get no better than this!</li>
    <li> works and tastes great</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know much about flossing but this is the best ever. it is easy to use and not aggressive at all.</li>
    <li> So here is my review of the Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Dental Floss.  It&#x27;s dental floss!  How do you review dental floss?  It works.  It tastes great (but don&#x27;t swallow). It comes in an easy to use small package (keep away from small children).  It came well packaged (but then what&#x27;s to get damaged?) and it shipped fast.  Would I purchase it again - of course!</li>
    <li> Shreds easier than it used to</li>
    <li> Sometime ago our dental professional (that&#x27;s just too faux for me) make that dentist suggested Oral-B Glide Floss so like good little patients, we tried it and have not looked back at the old floss.  (Gotta change that too.  Almost sounds as if we are reusing floss.  Not.)  We changed brands immediately and use the old for fishing and sewing buttons on to stay for a long time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of some flip comments, this brand of floss has it all over the other brands including the ancient one.  The one matter that is of particular positive interest for us is the absence of the floss getting cut by teeth while using.  Other brands could not say that as firmly.  Overall, a fantastic product and Oral-B has a new set of fans.</li>
    <li> I like this so much better than the &amp;#34;stringy&amp;#34; floss.  This is VERY minty and fresh.  Glide is the best!</li>
    <li> This is the best dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s gentle on my gums and the mint taste is nice.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side it that it occasionally breaks when it draws by a sharp tooth.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Does the job. No complaints. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> standard dental floss.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Standard product with standard performance. Packing and delivery were satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This floss is too &amp;#34;flossy&amp;#34;. It is soft and pulls apart too easily. Maybe I can use it for something else, but haven&#x27;t figured out what yet, All I know us it doesn&#x27;t work well as an actual dental floss.</li>
    <li> Probably the best floss I&#x27;ve ever bought - usually floss gets stuck between my teeth and irritates my gums.  This is much thinner and easier to work with - even my 3 year old figured out how to use it watching me!  My teeth have been much cleaner since using it.  Great for the price.</li>
    <li> This floss makes flossing a pleasure. I always stock up so I never have to worry about running out. A great product!</li>
    <li> best floss I have ever tried</li>
    <li> Best dental floss out there.  They&#x27;re very soft and flexible.</li>
    <li> Its floss, nice minty taste. I can not really say I love it, since it is dental floss. I will buy this again once I run out.</li>
    <li> FLOSS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as it should, Silky-smooth, more thin than other floss so you can work it between even tight&lt;br /&gt;spaces. I have a few tight spots that shred most floss but this holds up to the test</li>
    <li> Typically, I love this floss, and have found that this is the only floss that doesn&#x27;t snap into a million pieces while flossing my teeth. It is soft, yet thick and sturdy. I think I got a bad batch this go-round, though.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss continuously attempts to sliver into thin threads, which will of course break the instant it goes in-between a tooth. The loose end that you pull has also been lost inside the container twice, and when separating the container to retrieve the lost end, it has somehow disappeared, and you are left viewing a continuous loop of floss, with no loose end in sight. Good grief! I only want to floss my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product overall. Best overall floss I&#x27;ve used to date. I gave 3/5 stars only because of my aforementioned troubles. Whenever I buy this at Target, I don&#x27;t have any problems. As said, I think I just received a bad batch.</li>
    <li> Soft for your gum and teeth. Even though OralB has other floss, but this one is the best</li>
    <li> I like this much better than the string; especially the unwaxed kind.  This is much easier on my teeth and gumbs and works very well.</li>
    <li> Good value, very expensive in the grocery store.</li>
    <li> In some ways, floss is floss is floss. This stuff is comfortable, doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums, slides well between my teeth, keeps a grip on my fingers, and doesn&#x27;t shred. No real downside.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss that I use. I like this floss because it feels so smooth between my teeth. It doesn&#x27;t break like other flosses that I&#x27;ve used including Johnston&amp;Johnston or even other Oral-B Deep Clean floss. I highly recommend this floss.</li>
    <li> the best for my teeth!</li>
    <li> Love this floss! Best on market!</li>
    <li> The only dental floss I can use</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s dental floss, can&#x27;t say too much about it but it doesn&#x27;t fall apart or shred in use and you get a good amount of it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I found this floss to be easier on my gums. I have been using this floss for over two years.</li>
    <li> Have really tight teeth, floss works fine for me.</li>
    <li> I like using this brand of floss for my teeth.  It works great, and tastes nice and minty.</li>
    <li> this is the most comfortable floss I can find that does not irritate my gums.</li>
    <li> Glide is the only floss I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t shred. I usually have issues with flossing my crowded teeth, but no more. Stick with what works!</li>
    <li> I have always liked this floss. Amazon offers a great deal on it!</li>
    <li> Well, it is what you think it is, two pack of mint flavored floss.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for three weeks or so now, and I&#x27;ve never had any breaks or fraying so it does its job fine.  I don&#x27;t believe it is worth the cost though for a two pack, you could probably just pick some floss up at a supermarket for a little less.</li>
    <li> ONLY DENTAL FLOSS THAT WORKS FOR ME. I HAVE SMALL GAPS BETWEEN MY TEETH MAKES IT HARD TO USE MOST FLOSS. IT EITHER WON&#x27;T GET IN BETWEEN AT ALL OF IT USUALLY GETS STUCK. THIS IS ONLY ONE THAT WORKS AND DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A PROBLEM DOING WHAT IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO.</li>
    <li> I always use Glide because it does the best job getting by all my fillings.  Doesn&#x27;t make my gums bleed either. Have never found it in the double packs like this before.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only floss I can use since my teeth are to tight together!  I&#x27;ve tried using those thicker flosses that seem like they are made of yarn and they just get stuck in my teeth and make it worse.  My past 2 dentists have also told me to buy only this floss because of how it actually &amp;#34;glides&amp;#34; in and out of teeth and does not cut up your gums like some others can.  It has a refreshing flavor and doesn&#x27;t snap when you pull on it a little too tight.  Oral-B got it right!  You can also buy Crest Glide Floss as well, it&#x27;s the same thing as this since Oral-B and Crest are both under the Proctor-Gamble Corporate umbrella.</li>
    <li> Definately comfortable to use. Glides easily.</li>
    <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t so slippery.</li>
    <li> The floss is somewhat weak, and breaks on me about half the time</li>
    <li> This is the only floss I will use.  Goes easily in and out of my teeth, gently removing anything necessary.  It does not leave a waxy residue in your mouth, as some cheaper brands will do.  I have introduced this floss to several people who were not avid flossers before, and now they do so religiously with this floss, as do I!</li>
    <li> This is the best dental floss I have found after trying 4, 5, 6, ... different kinds.  It DOESN&#x27;T SHRED and is very easy and comfortable to slide between my teeth.  Will buy again.</li>
