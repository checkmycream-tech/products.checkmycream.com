      <li>Try the California Poppy, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
      <li>Its great take it about an hour before you want to go to sleep</li>
      <li>did not find it very effective for me.</li>
      <li>I successfully weaned myself off of opiates with the use of California Poppy..</li>
      <li>/&gt;After that, I got up, realized what had happened, got a bowl of vanilla bean ice cream, and thought about the experience, enjoying a wonderful afterglow from the herbs.</li>
      <li>Supplier was great in delivering product in good condition on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it would keep me out for the night and give me a good 7 hours sleep...</li>
      <li>/&gt;There were plenty of things lost in memory from this dream, but it was filled with wonderful imagery, and the nature of the experience made me wonder what things might have been like if I had a sister.</li>
      <li>But what good is it if you cannot use it?</li>
      <li>Nothing better than a great nights rest.</li>
      <li>It was absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing to me that Drs.</li>

      <li>To me it is delicious, almost sweet, and I enjoy allowing the tincture to linger in my mouth for the needed absorption time.</li>
      <li>Best on the Market by Far.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not exausted all the time, I can think better, I sleep alot more now.</li>
      <li>I find taking 10 mg of melatonin does a much better job.</li>
      <li>I brought it to help sleep better</li>
      <li>Any more</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, I know it may not work for everyone</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought a bottle for my girlfriend and mother and plan to buy more as gifts.</li>
      <li>It seemed weaker and required more of it in order to control the symptoms.</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>first sequence I remember was erotic in nature but didn&#x27;t involve me in any way.</li>
      <li>and I have been able to sleep most of the day and evening which is fine with me</li>
      <li>I do believe that I have better dream recollection when I take it, and that my dreams may be more intense.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how those will work together.</li>
      <li>I had significant euphoria, and I was quite sedated.</li>
      <li>I get so excited on some days that I can&#x27;t sleep at night.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t go to prison for over prescribing drugs to good people and later herding them neurologically into Heroin/Opiate junkies.</li>
      <li>Good for low tolerance users.</li>
      <li>but it does for me, very lucid dreams and able to recall them upon waking up.</li>
      <li>This quickly changed, and I started browsing through landscapes as if I was looking at a book of portraits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
      <li>The effect of the mixture was certainly better than using the herbs by themselves, though I still love drinking Passion Flower tea on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well, I had also ordered some California Poppy tincture from this company (Sense LLC), as I had been experiencing headaches, and I figured it would also be useful for my mild insomnia, so I went ahead and used 2 tablespoons of Passion Flower, 1 tablespoon of Vervain, and about 20 drops</li>
      <li>I Love this Natural Sleep Product!  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this since it was touted as a more natural alternative to the codones...and man, has it been a life saver!</li>
      <li>It worked ok, when I tried matching the dose of a 2-1 extract, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the brand I previously tried.</li>
      <li>which you should only take 3 drops to start out is amazing.</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s your aim, then this might be worth a try.</li>
      <li>Wow.. Absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>As I drifted off into a state of sleep that I could describe as \\&quot;not quite half-asleep,\\&quot; the visions were becoming quite vivid.</li>
      <li>Besides, the label does not mention Sense LLC,instead it has  a line (on the lower right)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is more like a \\&quot;whole \\&quot; body pain relief, not so generalized..and no negative side effects.</li>
      <li>&quot; I didn&#x27;t experience with the opiate, BUT, it is worth giving up more physical activity to not be controlled by a substance that 1)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>I decided to try it on the advice of a local Herbalist who&#x27;d owed a store for many years</li>
      <li>The first night I put 10 drops in a cup of tea</li>
      <li>I cannot give to him and will have to buy from the vet at a higher price.</li>
      <li>Woke up refreshed and alert for the first time in over a year.</li>
      <li>and I get VERY sleepy very fast.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had three lower spine surgeries in the past seven years and still have nerve pain that prevents me from getting a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
      <li>My hands and feet start to warm and tingle slightly while I can feel my tension ease away.  </li>
      <li>This brand is excellent and the price was lower than the other brand I usually buy.</li>
      <li>I have been trying to stay clear of using prescription sedatives to calm my mind and body, so I made a tea with a mixture of herbs.</li>
      <li>I use to get up and write things and draw scetches of products I should invent that was how fast my mind would race, or</li>
      <li>started the process as I always do, and I noticed my relaxation making room for very lucid thoughts.</li>
      <li>, it eases you into a gentle slumber</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help me sleep</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>, I have on and off health problems, so there are days I real have nothing I have to do</li>
      <li>As for the taste, I happen to really and truly like the taste.</li>
      <li>However, about once a month, my pain is so intense that I need something to break through the pain.</li>
      <li>Maybe you&#x27;re supposed to drink the whole bottle at once?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Because of these unique effects, I decided to go back inside and meditate.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many sleep aids, from melatonin to other over the counter stuff.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy my tinctures from any other source, they are caring and their quality is top notch</li>
      <li>This particular experience was very unique.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This particular brand, is not as strong as some of the other brands available in the same size.</li>
      <li>There was fantastic natural imagry with two naked women bathing in a pool of water.</li>
      <li>(that did not work at all) and so tried this, anything to get a decent night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
      <li>It seems like a very clean and pure remedy for trouble sleeping and relaxing.</li>
      <li>I highly recomend this to anyone who&#x27;s mind races when they got to bed.</li>
      <li>, I have tried several other brands and even bought for awhile from a person who makes her own, (not advisable bc of hygenics)...  </li>
      <li>There were light, transparent images floating through my vision as I layed there with my eyes closed.</li>
      <li>My meditation requires no complex procedure.</li>
      <li>And when I have stuff to do I&#x27;m not falling asleep tired when I have things to do because I&#x27;m sleeping Good when I do sleep.  </li>
      <li>I was completely dreaming at this point, and I was slightly less aware of the world around me, but I am quite sure I would have been alerted if I heard any intrusive noise from the outside world.</li>
      <li>I felt like a new person.</li>
      <li>I typically add it to my night time tea, it has a sweet very tolerable taste.</li>
      <li>This natural opiate...</li>
      <li>But as far as this product - it truly has been a life-saver</li>
      <li>So far, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I recently added Calea Zacatechichi Tincture - Lucid Dream Inducer and I HIGHLY recommend it also!</li>
      <li>If someone were in the room, I could have carried on a conversation with them at that level of awareness, yet I was in an almost complete dream state.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am completely diasppointed.  </li>
      <li>It was at the part directly before the fellowship was formed where the meeting was held in Rivendell.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t through months of using it nearly every night.</li>
      <li>My anxiety was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Memories were being recalled of books that I had read when I was young, and I was actually looking at the pictures of a particular book in the dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>On this particular late afternoon (around 6pm), I was experiencing some significant anxiety.</li>
      <li>I have tried other similar products such as this and none compare to the taste, quality and having it arrive at my home quickly!  </li>

    <li> Best on the Market by Far.  I have tried other similar products such as this and none compare to the taste, quality and having it arrive at my home quickly!  I Love this Natural Sleep Product!  It Rocks!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Wow.. Absolutely love this. I was very skeptical at first but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try due to my lupus pain and insomnia, this product has worked wonders. No unwanted reactions, feels like instant relaxation and over a few days my pain had eased so much I felt like a new person. Best sleep ever. Overall I would recommend this to anyone with pain and restlessness. Works great! Thanks</li>
    <li> Supplier was great in delivering product in good condition on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is still be tested to see if it works as they claim on Dr. Oz.  So far, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> worthless item is not as advertised. Has a bad taste. not sure what it effect it was to have on me.</li>
    <li> On this particular late afternoon (around 6pm), I was experiencing some significant anxiety. I have been trying to stay clear of using prescription sedatives to calm my mind and body, so I made a tea with a mixture of herbs. I am very experienced with Passion Flower (Passiflora incarnata), which has seemed to be medicinal in a variety of ways. Recently, I was also introduced to Vervain. I have found that the mixture of Passion Flower and Vervain enhance the positive qualities of each other. Well, I had also ordered some California Poppy tincture from this company (Sense LLC), as I had been experiencing headaches, and I figured it would also be useful for my mild insomnia, so I went ahead and used 2 tablespoons of Passion Flower, 1 tablespoon of Vervain, and about 20 drops California Poppy which are all typical doses for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 15-20min. after drinking the tea, I went outside to smoke some Tobacco, and I was very interested in the synergistic effect the herbs were having with each other. It was the perfect remedy for my issues that day. The effect of the mixture was certainly better than using the herbs by themselves, though I still love drinking Passion Flower tea on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could feel the typical effects of the Passion Flower, but there was something else going on within my neurological receptors that was quite pleasurable. I had significant euphoria, and I was quite sedated. My anxiety was completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of these unique effects, I decided to go back inside and meditate. My meditation requires no complex procedure. It is simply characterized by laying on my back and clearing my mind of everyday thought that can induce anxiety or generally anything preventing me from completely relaxing. Usually when I do this, I achieve some level of conscious dreaming, and once in a while I fall asleep. This particular experience was very unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started the process as I always do, and I noticed my relaxation making room for very lucid thoughts. There were light, transparent images floating through my vision as I layed there with my eyes closed. As I drifted off into a state of sleep that I could describe as \\&quot;not quite half-asleep,\\&quot; the visions were becoming quite vivid. If someone were in the room, I could have carried on a conversation with them at that level of awareness, yet I was in an almost complete dream state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first sequence I remember was erotic in nature but didn&#x27;t involve me in any way. There was fantastic natural imagry with two naked women bathing in a pool of water. This quickly changed, and I started browsing through landscapes as if I was looking at a book of portraits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, scenarios started to form. I was completely dreaming at this point, and I was slightly less aware of the world around me, but I am quite sure I would have been alerted if I heard any intrusive noise from the outside world. At this point in the dream, I was a child about eleven or twelve years of age. I was in my house that I had lived in my entire life, but it looked identical to how it did when I was that age. However, things were different. I had a sister that was a couple years younger than me. (in reality, I have no siblings). I remember walking into my bedroom while my sister was walking out of the bathroom, and I just looked at her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the scenarios transformed again, and I was a child of a younger age. Memories were being recalled of books that I had read when I was young, and I was actually looking at the pictures of a particular book in the dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were plenty of things lost in memory from this dream, but it was filled with wonderful imagery, and the nature of the experience made me wonder what things might have been like if I had a sister. I found myself thinking about the psychological differences between feminine and masculine qualities later on that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this ended as I woke up, and \\&quot;The Lordof the Rings (The Fellowship of the Ring)\\&quot; was playing in my DVD player. It was at the part directly before the fellowship was formed where the meeting was held in Rivendell. Gimli, the dwarf says \\&quot;I&#x27;ll be dead before I see the ring in the hands of an Elf!\\&quot; I heard, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll be dead before I fall asleep in a bed of Tulips!\\&quot; What the...? At this point, I actually thought for a minute that I had a censored version of the movie, thinking that the quote was a statement of racism. \\&quot;Laughs\\&quot; It was quite strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I got up, realized what had happened, got a bowl of vanilla bean ice cream, and thought about the experience, enjoying a wonderful afterglow from the herbs. I thought that I had been in a dream state for 20-30min., but in reality, I had been there for over two hours! It was absolutely amazing. I have very little experience with Calea zacatechichi (Dream Herb) which also ordered earlier from this Hawaiian company in leaf cut form, but I am quite interested in it now along with other herbs having profound effects on dreams.</li>
    <li> It takes about 5-10 minutes to feel but you can definitely tell when it kicks in.  My hands and feet start to warm and tingle slightly while I can feel my tension ease away.  I have only used it a couple times so will try to update after some repeated uses if anything changes.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help me sleep but nothing except prescription meds work for me.</li>
    <li> For the past 10 yrs or so I have had a lot of trouble sleeping, Ive been on Ativan and Ambein and still had trouble staying asleep. I tried this product out of desperation after hearing Dr Oz talking about it. I have been taking 3/4 of a teaspoon before bed for about 2 weeks and Im sleeping like a baby! I recently added Calea Zacatechichi Tincture - Lucid Dream Inducer and I HIGHLY recommend it also!</li>
    <li> This california poppy tincture is relaxing. It doesn&#x27;t produce any unwanted side effects. It seems like a very clean and pure remedy for trouble sleeping and relaxing. If you need help unwinding after a long day, or simply help sleeping. Try the California Poppy, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I do like this product, like I stated will buy again, just it&#x27;s not as before. So it&#x27;s does deliver nice rest and no side effect , you will awake feeling rested.</li>
    <li> did not find it very effective for me. took about double the suggested dose, and still not much effect.  Oh well was hopping it would keep me out for the night and give me a good 7 hours sleep...I find taking 10 mg of melatonin does a much better job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing to me that Drs. don&#x27;t go to prison for over prescribing drugs to good people and later herding them neurologically into Heroin/Opiate junkies. This product could help someone way before they have their lives ruined by a $$$ deep pocket Dr.  I see a lot of &amp;#34;prescriptioned&amp;#34; lives ruined by immoral Dr. behavior in my line of work. Its sad and many are victims who end up in prison. Moving along....I get so excited on some days that I can&#x27;t sleep at night. Cant wind down. This natural opiate...which you should only take 3 drops to start out is amazing. It tastes bad because it&#x27;s usually alcohol-based. If you take 3 drops, then lay in bed, you can feel it go through your blood stream..or its slowing you heart beat which soothes your spirit.</li>
    <li> This brand is excellent and the price was lower than the other brand I usually buy.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy my tinctures from any other source, they are caring and their quality is top notch, I have tried several other brands and even bought for awhile from a person who makes her own, (not advisable bc of hygenics)...  Hawaii pharm has this down pact!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a hopeful, personal point of view...I successfully weaned myself off of opiates with the use of California Poppy..I was taking 4 pills a day for over 8 years!!..I decided to try it on the advice of a local Herbalist who&#x27;d owed a store for many years, I tried it, it took a couple weeks to adjust and make allowances for \\&quot;extra pain\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t experience with the opiate, BUT, it is worth giving up more physical activity to not be controlled by a substance that 1) \\&quot;knocks you out\\&quot;..2) causes organ damage,sleeplessness, trauma (such as sweats, diareah ,constipation, vomiting if you cannot get it)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more like a \\&quot;whole \\&quot; body pain relief, not so generalized..and no negative side effects.( and my doctor is on board with it!!)</li>
    <li> I work 3rd shift and have always been a night person but I have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep even with Ambian.  I take it 2 times a day not 3  like recomended and I love it it has changed my life.  I&#x27;m not exausted all the time, I can think better, I sleep alot more now. I dont have kids,and I work 3rd shift, I have on and off health problems, so there are days I real have nothing I have to do and I have been able to sleep most of the day and evening which is fine with me, my body so can use the rest to heal itself.  And when I have stuff to do I&#x27;m not falling asleep tired when I have things to do because I&#x27;m sleeping Good when I do sleep.  I highly recomend this to anyone who&#x27;s mind races when they got to bed. I use to get up and write things and draw scetches of products I should invent that was how fast my mind would race, or thinking I should be doing dishes or laundry or what ever task.  NowI lay down and I couldnt even tell you what my brain is thinking of and off to sleep I go. TRY IT !!</li>
    <li> Great product for anxiety and for sleeping.</li>
    <li> This particular brand, is not as strong as some of the other brands available in the same size. I&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t notice that when I bought the product. It worked ok, when I tried matching the dose of a 2-1 extract, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the brand I previously tried. This was the 2nd brand I&#x27;ve tried, since seeing this product on the Dr Oz show.</li>
    <li> Was weaker than other brands, however, it does say 1:3 ratio (1 part herb x tract , 3 parts alcohol) when the overseas one said 1:2 ratio. Good for low tolerance users.</li>
    <li> I had read that this did NOT have alcohol.. not true 60% alcohol base. I bought to give to my aging cat who suffers from joint pain as recommended by my holistic vet. I cannot give to him and will have to buy from the vet at a higher price. But what good is it if you cannot use it?</li>
    <li> Watching Dr. Oz, he suggested California Poppy for sever pain. Sleep seems to be the only relief I get and this product definitely does the trick.  I haven&#x27;t tried it during the day yet but works wonderfully (with my medications) to help me sleep.</li>
    <li> I have read about this plant extract in a health magazine and thought I&#x27;d try it. I&#x27;ve been waking up every 1 to 1 1/2 hours and could not sleep through the night. Completely exhausted every day. Had tried melatonin, even a doctor prescribed sleeping pill (that did not work at all) and so tried this, anything to get a decent night&#x27;s sleep. The first night I put 10 drops in a cup of tea (that was the amount listed in the article, I did not see any recommended amount on the product) and slept 9 hours. Woke up refreshed and alert for the first time in over a year. Been taking it for two weeks now and it&#x27;s working great. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I know it may not work for everyone but it does for me, very lucid dreams and able to recall them upon waking up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year now as needed for insomnia. It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;hangover free&amp;#34; remedy I&#x27;ve found. I wake up rested and not groggy.&lt;br /&gt;The supplier is excellent. Competitive pricing and their items always arrive on time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything, but at least it doesn&#x27;t taste bad.  Maybe you&#x27;re supposed to drink the whole bottle at once?</li>
    <li> I have a essential tremors in my hands and it has not helped me at all. Any other suggestions for me?</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it just does not work.  No effect whatsoever. This is scam. I am completely diasppointed.  Besides, the label does not mention Sense LLC,instead it has  a line (on the lower right)[...]. This is Russian web site.  BUYERS BEWARE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three lower spine surgeries in the past seven years and still have nerve pain that prevents me from getting a good night&#x27;s sleep.  I don&#x27;t want to rely strictly on prescription drugs for the rest of my life, so I tried this.  It doesn&#x27;t solve all of my problems, but it does help, and I&#x27;ll continue with it.  P.S. - I use 20 drops of the tincture in water before bed.  Any more and I get VERY sleepy very fast.  If that&#x27;s your aim, then this might be worth a try.</li>
    <li> I brought it to help sleep better but this simply doesn&#x27;t work at all. I just hope it does not have any bad side effects</li>
    <li> This product caused me to itch all over.i bought two different versions of this and I got the same result.</li>
    <li> Its great take it about an hour before you want to go to sleep, it eases you into a gentle slumber and you do not wake up feeling weird or groggy</li>
    <li> I am not a lucid dreamer so can not report on the product&#x27;s effectiveness if that is your objective. I purchased as a sleep aid, and I am unsure if it helps me to sleep. I do believe that I have better dream recollection when I take it, and that my dreams may be more intense. Alas, as a light sleeper, I sometimes wake from the intensity of a dream, so as a sleep aid it isn&#x27;t helping, but as an entertainment, it is. As for the taste, I happen to really and truly like the taste. To me it is delicious, almost sweet, and I enjoy allowing the tincture to linger in my mouth for the needed absorption time.</li>
    <li> I have fibromyalgia and have avoided using pharmaceuticals as much as possible. However, about once a month, my pain is so intense that I need something to break through the pain. I decided to try this since it was touted as a more natural alternative to the codones...and man, has it been a life saver! I just bought some passionflower and st.john&#x27;s wort in dried form from another source to use as a calming tea at night, since sleep deprivation is one of the biggest issues in my fibromyalgia. I&#x27;m excited to see how those will work together. But as far as this product - it truly has been a life-saver and I&#x27;m only sorry that I waited so long to order the second bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many sleep aids, from melatonin to other over the counter stuff. None compare to just 5-10 drops of california poppy. I typically add it to my night time tea, it has a sweet very tolerable taste. Puts me in a very relaxed mood, I never wake up groggy like other medicines, feels very natural. Unlike melatonin, you don&#x27;t build up a tolerance to this, atleast I haven&#x27;t through months of using it nearly every night. I&#x27;ve bought a bottle for my girlfriend and mother and plan to buy more as gifts. Nothing better than a great nights rest.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and while I received it much quicker than my previous purchase, it did not seem to have the desired effect (I have Restless Legs Syndrome). It seemed weaker and required more of it in order to control the symptoms.And did not last as long as I had needed to it, so I probably won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
