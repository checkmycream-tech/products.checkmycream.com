    <li> If you are in need of fin straighteners for an air conditioner you are looking at the right item!  Multiple sizes ask held together and they work great.  Just go slow and take your time and these things work great!  It will never be exactly perfectly like before they were flattened,  however,  these will get you the closest.  Just remember,  choose the right size,  and take your time!</li>
    <li> The tool was easy to use, and performed well. The plastic was strong and it fit in my hand comfortably.</li>
    <li> Was torn between going with an all-in-one fin comb, or these YJs. Glad I went with these combs, they work great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE! Takes dirt, mud, hair you name it out from the finns, while you straighten them out or just cleaning them.</li>
    <li> This worked exactly as expected.  I used it on my AC unit outside.  After I got the hang of it, it took minutes to straighten everything.  Also, although it does not look brand new,  it looks 100% better.</li>
    <li> Tool works as expected. Will not make the coil look as it did from manufacturer but will align fins to allow air flow. With a little work and correct comb you can correct most damaged coil fins.</li>
    <li> didnt come with the one I needed, I figured out of 6, Id find 1 that fit!!!!! nope</li>
    <li> Straightened the fins on the indoor side with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;The fins didn&#x27;t exactly look new afterward, but they were no longer blocked.&lt;br /&gt;It also removed some stuff from the fins that looked like wood putty, that a brush didn&#x27;t touch.&lt;br /&gt;The air conditioner works much better now. In this case, $20 well-spent.</li>
    <li> The best fin straighteners that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> perfect straightening and cleaning for my AC and car fins - let a mechanic borrow mine he is buy a set</li>
    <li> very good and excellent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these sitting around for the last month or so waiting for an opportunity to use them. I was actually excited to use them because of the great reviews they had and I was sure they fit my heat pump fins properly because I counted mine and read on a review that this fin comb set included the one I needed. That&#x27;s why I was upset when I discovered that they can actually damage the fins that are bent. I&#x27;m really not sure if the fact that they stripped off some of the fins was due to the hard plastic or because of something else but I did my best to be gentle with them and it still happened. It worked part of the time and straightened out some of the fins but it sure did rip up others. After several attempts at doing things differently to see if it was just me, I gave up. There is another fin comb I saw on amazon and even saw a video of it being used that had worse reviews but seemed to be made of a softer plastic/rubber material. I may be purchasing that one down the road to see if it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Fins bent in numerous places on inside coil by duct cleaning people. Bought these not knowing what size I needed, figured since there were so many sizes one would have to fit.  One did fit and put the fins back in place. Fyi Don&#x27;t ever hire a random company to clean your ducts, hire a good hvac company.  Put a stop payment on the check, lesson learned.</li>
    <li> No good if your fins are completely smashed.</li>
    <li> Good selection of sizes and exceptionally sturdy plastic material.  No breaking.</li>
    <li> The fins of my condenser were mashed completely flat by a hail storm. I found the correct comb and went to town. It worked perfectly, and improved the efficiency of my air conditioner by the boatload.  Great product, easy to use, excellent variety to meet any need.  An inexpensive and handy set of tools to have.  A+++++</li>
    <li> Kit came quickly. Its not the end all fix I was hoping for. It does an ok job with some of the fins but if they are really smashed down there is not much that can be done.</li>
    <li> This is just what I have been looking for.  It works great.</li>
