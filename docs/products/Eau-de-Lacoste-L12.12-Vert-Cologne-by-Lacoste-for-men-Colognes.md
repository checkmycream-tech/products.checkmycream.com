      <li>The moment I smelled the sample, I knew that it would be a great gift for a guy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I was using AVON&#x27;s Ironman which leave me smelling good for almost 8 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Bad</li>
      <li>I have been reading really good reviews about Lacoste EDTs, but I would like to try an EDT which I have never had before buying one.</li>
      <li>You know it&#x27;s good when your girlfriend steals it from you</li>
      <li>It smells good to me.</li>
      <li>So I purchased this Spray on line from Amazon for a good price</li>
      <li>He loved it.</li>
      <li>Great product and even better price</li>
      <li>Very pleased..</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>courteous service</li>
      <li>New, on original package, perfect!</li>
      <li>, it sells at Macy&#x27;s for more that $85.00.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s more of a summer time scent, but I don&#x27;t think that should stop you from ever wearing it.</li>
      <li>I opened and love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using their colognes for over a decade and they just keep getting better</li>
      <li>100% satisfied.</li>
      <li>gladly recommend it.</li>
      <li>You know you&#x27;ve just purchased a great cologne when even your ex can&#x27;t help but compliment your new smell.</li>
      <li>I like it personally because of how great it smells, I agrees with my temperament.</li>
      <li>And great price $38.68 total!!!!!</li>
      <li>though it&#x27;s not a new fragrance from Lacoste, their colognes/perfumes are great for day to day use.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my boyfriend because I love the smell of it so much.</li>
      <li>Clean, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Scent is as good as all of them, but none of them lasts as long as this Verde when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>A little on the sweeter side, seems more appropriate for the summer time.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t the right cologne that I wanted, but it definitely meets our expectations and more.</li>
      <li>Original fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Fresh, citrus, sporty scent: good for a young person that is active</li>
      <li>, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a new line or their original fragrance.</li>
      <li>, I really liked the product, what I expected.</li>
      <li>Knock off that smelled like hot garbage.</li>
      <li>This scent was exactly like the sample.</li>
      <li>A good scent for everyday and/or work.  </li>
      <li>Hope it works good for everyday use.</li>
      <li>What can you say about this stuff - pretty subjective really.</li>
      <li>As usual like with any other Lacoste product, you get the best quality you can get from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>light enough yet the scent has staying power.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s his favorite and it is half the price here than anywhere else</li>
      <li>Not overly expensive and great quality.</li>
      <li>do currently have, Dunhill Pure, Vesace L&amp;#34;Homme, and L&#x27;aeu D&#x27;issey, and now Verde which I orderd thru Amazon.</li>
      <li>Smells terrific and my wife loves it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>Not too heavy, but not too light and fruity, either.  </li>
      <li>Big bottle, fresh smell, he loooves green :) I only found it on the internet, the green bottle, not at kohl&#x27;s or at the mall where I looked for initially.</li>
      <li>It had a fresh scent, but what amazed me the most was how long the scent of the small sample I put on my hand lasted, 3 days (BTW, I shower at least once a day:-))!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not like this product, Its aroma doesn&#x27;t last even an hour, I hve been used Polo, Allure and Eternity before this, there is no comparison; I could feel their smell even next day.&lt;br /&gt;i am not going to try it again</li>
    <li> You know you&#x27;ve just purchased a great cologne when even your ex can&#x27;t help but compliment your new smell. I like it personally because of how great it smells, I agrees with my temperament. Just ordered a second bottle.</li>
    <li> You know it&#x27;s good when your girlfriend steals it from you and you have to buy yourself another one</li>
    <li> Clean, fresh scent.  Not too heavy, but not too light and fruity, either.  A good scent for everyday and/or work.  Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy this from this company. Knock off that smelled like hot garbage. Ordered two and they only sent one thank goodness. But then they would reimburse me for the one they didn&#x27;t send. Not happy at all with this purchase. Waste of 80 bucks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. It&#x27;s his favorite and it is half the price here than anywhere else I found it. He loved it. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> What can you say about this stuff - pretty subjective really. It smells good to me. A little on the sweeter side, seems more appropriate for the summer time.</li>
    <li> I sampled this fragrance in a Lacoste Store and they were sold out. So I purchased this Spray on line from Amazon for a good price and I am happy to add it to my collection.</li>
    <li> I received a small vial as a sample and left it out for my husband to try. It&#x27;s a delightful scent. Once he was out of the sample, I had to buy a regular bottle. This scent was exactly like the sample.</li>
    <li> Original fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Fresh, citrus, sporty scent: good for a young person that is active&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;Affordable price&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> courteous service, I really liked the product, what I expected. gladly recommend it. 100% satisfied. the seller was always responsive to my questions. This product is sold at a good price with very good quality in the material production.</li>
    <li> It smells great and my fiance loved it! It wasn&#x27;t the right cologne that I wanted, but it definitely meets our expectations and more.</li>
    <li> Great product and even better price, it sells at Macy&#x27;s for more that $85.00. Item arrived sooner than expected and I couldn&#x27;t be happier plus the wife loves it. Will order again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for my fiancé, I will give it for Easter! I opened and love it. Big bottle, fresh smell, he loooves green :) I only found it on the internet, the green bottle, not at kohl&#x27;s or at the mall where I looked for initially. Hope it works good for everyday use. Love it! And great price $38.68 total!!!!! YEY</li>
    <li> After reeding some reviews about this cologne ,got myself two .I am disappointed of the short lasting aroma that this product has.I was using AVON&#x27;s Ironman which leave me smelling good for almost 8 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Bad cologne for the price.  NO GOOD!!!</li>
    <li> The moment I smelled the sample, I knew that it would be a great gift for a guy.&lt;br /&gt;I brought it for my bf on valentines day.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Every time he wears it, he gets a lot of compliments :D</li>
    <li> Very pleased..light enough yet the scent has staying power. I&#x27;d recommend it for the man who  has delusions of driving an Aston Martin not under recall with Victoria Beckham in the front seat.</li>
    <li> I just bought it a few days ago directly from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller (didn&#x27;t want to risk getting a non-original product). Smells terrific and my wife loves it as much as I do.

I&#x27;ve been using their colognes for over a decade and they just keep getting better, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a new line or their original fragrance. Not overly expensive and great quality.</li>
    <li> New, on original package, perfect!</li>
    <li> I have been reading really good reviews about Lacoste EDTs, but I would like to try an EDT which I have never had before buying one. So, I stopped by one the chain stores which I knew would carry them and try them one by one. I didn&#x27;t like any of them except the &amp;#34;Verde&amp;#34; one which their sample bottle labled it &amp;#34;Relaxed&amp;#34;. It had a fresh scent, but what amazed me the most was how long the scent of the small sample I put on my hand lasted, 3 days (BTW, I shower at least once a day:-))!&lt;br /&gt;I do currently have, Dunhill Pure, Vesace L&amp;#34;Homme, and L&#x27;aeu D&#x27;issey, and now Verde which I orderd thru Amazon. Scent is as good as all of them, but none of them lasts as long as this Verde when you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my summer EDT next to D&#x27;issey.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because I love the smell of it so much. I think it&#x27;s more of a summer time scent, but I don&#x27;t think that should stop you from ever wearing it.</li>
    <li> PRODUCTO RECOMENDADO. BUEN OLOR Y DURADERO. Y LLEGO EN PERFECTO ESTADO Y EN EL TIEMPO PROMETIDO. GRACIAS. . . .</li>
