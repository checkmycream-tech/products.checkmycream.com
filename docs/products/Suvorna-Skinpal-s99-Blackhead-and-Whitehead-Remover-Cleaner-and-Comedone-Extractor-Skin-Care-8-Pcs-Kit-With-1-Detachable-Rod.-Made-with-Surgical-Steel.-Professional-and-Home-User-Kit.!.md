      <li>the case looks very nice and it does the job that suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;i am very satisfied with its quality.</li>
      <li>Good quality</li>
      <li>it is still good</li>
      <li>In glad I bought them!</li>
      <li>However you need patience and practice to use these kind of products</li>
      <li>It did more damage than good.  </li>
      <li>The set also comes in a nice case to hold every thing.</li>
      <li>Just hurts my face to be honest.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great set and is worth the price.</li>
      <li>It is much more effective:</li>
      <li>Not my favorite despite the good reviews that were given seems kind of cheap when I received it, but gets the job done in a pinch.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable to hold.  </li>
      <li>A nice set for a great price if you want to take care of your skin professionally.  </li>
      <li>This extractor does a much better job.</li>
      <li>Simply the best home dissection kit I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
      <li>I use this mostly for blackheads and it does help with the stubborn ones.  </li>
      <li>However, the quality of the attachments are superb and definate upgrade from my last skin care product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommened and good price.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and easy to clean off the experiments.</li>
      <li>Very well made products in a nice carrying case</li>
      <li>this thing is cool you will feel like you are a professional dermatologist and you will be looking for whiteheads on every body lmao!</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had nothing but a good experience with it.  </li>
      <li>So I ordered this set of tools for her to use on my back and she is pretty happy with them.</li>
      <li>I didnt expect this to be such good quality.  </li>
      <li>I just wish they would update the whole set to use something better than screwing in the attachments.</li>
      <li>I used to pick at my pimples, now there is no need to as this product has the perfect tools to get rid of whiteheads, blackheads and various types of pimples/acne which leaves my skin looking much better with little to no aftermath (scabbing &amp; scarring).</li>
      <li>Stainless steal is the way to go for anything that has to do with inserting it into the body because it can be easily sanitized over and over.  </li>
      <li>the case is very nice and holds all the part tight so they wont fall out.  </li>
      <li>Still learning to use the tools, it takes some learning to it, but well worth the $ since they can be sterilized.</li>
      <li>the only thing that could have made this set better would have been if they would have included another stem instead of just one for screwing the tips on to.</li>
      <li>and I am more likey to get a bigger scab</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a lot of sufficient light when using the spoon since the hole is tiny and it needs to sit directly around the whitehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My only word of caution is that you should push the easy ones out by using kleenex over the hands.  </li>
      <li>I noticed if I use it on easy ones, that it damages a bigger piece of the skin around it</li>
      <li>looks fine, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as ones i have purchased from local cosmology supply stores.</li>
      <li>These tools make life so much easier than using your hands</li>
      <li>WOW!!!</li>
      <li>It came in a nice storage box, the steel feels like it will last a very long time.  </li>
      <li>I am replacing an older set I had.  </li>
      <li>I gave the item 2 stars because I did not receive the main body of the tool to which the attachments screw into.  </li>
      <li>Make sure to read the information enclosed and also educate yourself on how to PROPERLY use the various tools included.  </li>
      <li>I usually take cotton balls and soak them with 90% rubbing alcohol to clean my pimple before extraction and also to clean my tools before I use them.</li>
      <li>Small case would make them very easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>This little case of comedone extractors allows me many options depending on the size of the comedone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They still might be useful if you are under anesthesia and have a doctor help you; but then we&#x27;re talking professional-use, and they may be using a different brand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like going to a spa and getting extractions done by a professional...</li>
      <li>That being said, now that I&#x27;m an adult and a lot smarter about my skin, I started using natural holistic remedies to cure my acne.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s usually a professional working on a patient; not someone using them solo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This kit is necessary for anyone that wants to take care of blemishes and blackheads without damaging skin or causing infecion.  </li>
      <li>I had a big break out on my back after getting it waxed for the first (and last) time.</li>
      <li>, you will like this because if one does not work as well just grab another, you will never feel like your missing something, all the tools you will ever need are right here in this carrying case.</li>

<li> She primarily uses the loop for things like an ingrown hair, the small bowl for white heads with puss, and the spear tip to scrape off dead skin or scabs that is clogging a pore.</li>
<li> Then I usually use the loop extractor for large whiteheads.</li>
<li> I usually go for the sharp pointed tool first even if i have a whitehead because it gently open up the whitehead for extraction.</li>
<li> I have been taking DIM supplements with Burdock Root and Vitex everyday.</li>
<li> For smaller harder whitehead bumps, I use the spoon and it get literally everything out.</li>
<li> I bought one for me, and one for my lab assistant who generally agrees with the previous sentences I typed.</li>
<li> Smaller than what I thought, not all of the attachments screw in tightly.</li>
<li> This kits got everything but be careful.....</li>
<li> The only negative thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that some tops are a little loose when they screw on, but it&#x27;s possible that this is just on my model</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried these on blackheads located on my nose with no success.  </li>
<li> Some things are not meant to be used by those who are not professional!!!!!</li>
<li> Tools are steel (surgical grade I believe) and allow you to use less pressure to remove pimples.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s quick, much less painful, and cleaner.</li>
<li> No more squeezing and spreading bacteria.</li>
<li> and I was afraid I might crush my septum before I applied enough pressure to get even one blackhead.</li>
<li> I purchased a basic two end extractor and that was terrible!  </li>
<li> During a facial, it was suggested that I purchase a tool to help extract the awful stuff.  </li>
<li> and unfortunately I started to breakout.  </li>
<li> You must have to push VERY hard, which is painful, in order to push out the gunk.  </li>

    <li> This kit is necessary for anyone that wants to take care of blemishes and blackheads without damaging skin or causing infecion.  Tools are steel (surgical grade I believe) and allow you to use less pressure to remove pimples. Highly recommened and good price.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set.  Very comfortable to hold.  Good quality nothing flimsy here.  A nice set for a great price if you want to take care of your skin professionally.  Small case would make them very easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> I use this mostly for blackheads and it does help with the stubborn ones.  My only word of caution is that you should push the easy ones out by using kleenex over the hands.  I noticed if I use it on easy ones, that it damages a bigger piece of the skin around it and I am more likey to get a bigger scab then if I just used my fingers.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and unfortunately I started to breakout.  During a facial, it was suggested that I purchase a tool to help extract the awful stuff.  I purchased a basic two end extractor and that was terrible!  It did more damage than good.  This kit provides the perfect tools for taking care of these pesky pimples and I don&#x27;t have to worry about scarring.

    <li> Smaller than what I thought, not all of the attachments screw in tightly. Not my favorite despite the good reviews that were given seems kind of cheap when I received it, but gets the job done in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for 15 years. I&#x27;ve been on accutane twice and have probably taken every prescription antibiotic and topical cream under the sun. That being said, now that I&#x27;m an adult and a lot smarter about my skin, I started using natural holistic remedies to cure my acne. I have been taking DIM supplements with Burdock Root and Vitex everyday. This is drastically reduced my breakouts.... but even when I do get pimples, I get whiteheads. So I bought the Suvorna extraction tools to help. WOW!!! these tools are amazing and extract whiteheads perfectly. No more squeezing and spreading bacteria. I usually take cotton balls and soak them with 90% rubbing alcohol to clean my pimple before extraction and also to clean my tools before I use them. I usually go for the sharp pointed tool first even if i have a whitehead because it gently open up the whitehead for extraction. Then I usually use the loop extractor for large whiteheads. For smaller harder whitehead bumps, I use the spoon and it get literally everything out. Make sure you have a lot of sufficient light when using the spoon since the hole is tiny and it needs to sit directly around the whitehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pimples are healed literally a day after I pop them now. Also, I bought a face steamer to pre-steam my face sometimes before using. It&#x27;s like going to a spa and getting extractions done by a professional... except once you get the hang of doing it yourself, you will do a better job than the spa!!</li>
    <li> The handle and part of the case were burnt when I received it, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the usefullness. it is still good</li>
    <li> Still learning to use the tools, it takes some learning to it, but well worth the $ since they can be sterilized.</li>
    <li> this thing is cool you will feel like you are a professional dermatologist and you will be looking for whiteheads on every body lmao!</li>
    <li> Works great. Great condition. In glad I bought them!</li>
    <li> Very well made products in a nice carrying case, you will like this because if one does not work as well just grab another, you will never feel like your missing something, all the tools you will ever need are right here in this carrying case.</li>
    <li> I am replacing an older set I had.  I find these tools to help me take care of my blemish a must have.  Nothing not to like about this set I just wish they would update the whole set to use something better than screwing in the attachments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve watched (gross) video on how to use these sort of tools and it&#x27;s usually a professional working on a patient; not someone using them solo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use these solo and I was afraid I might crush my septum before I applied enough pressure to get even one blackhead. I&#x27;d rather just go back to the standard squeezing than use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They still might be useful if you are under anesthesia and have a doctor help you; but then we&#x27;re talking professional-use, and they may be using a different brand.</li>
    <li> It came in a nice storage box, the steel feels like it will last a very long time.  Now I just need to learn how to use it properly.</li>
    <li> I had a big break out on my back after getting it waxed for the first (and last) time. My wife was trying to help some zits drain thinking it would help heal faster. So I ordered this set of tools for her to use on my back and she is pretty happy with them. She primarily uses the loop for things like an ingrown hair, the small bowl for white heads with puss, and the spear tip to scrape off dead skin or scabs that is clogging a pore. The set also comes in a nice case to hold every thing. the only thing that could have made this set better would have been if they would have included another stem instead of just one for screwing the tips on to.</li>
    <li> the case looks very nice and it does the job that suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;i am very satisfied with its quality.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  I didnt expect this to be such good quality.  Stainless steal is the way to go for anything that has to do with inserting it into the body because it can be easily sanitized over and over.  the case is very nice and holds all the part tight so they wont fall out.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As described. However you need patience and practice to use these kind of products</li>
    <li> This kits got everything but be careful..... Some things are not meant to be used by those who are not professional!!!!!</li>
    <li> Before getting this set, I used to use the two fingers method to pop pimples. This extractor does a much better job. It is much more effective: it&#x27;s quick, much less painful, and cleaner. There are multiple tops you can screw on to use depending on your need. The only negative thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that some tops are a little loose when they screw on, but it&#x27;s possible that this is just on my model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great set and is worth the price.</li>
    <li> looks fine, but doesn&#x27;t work as well as ones i have purchased from local cosmology supply stores. Just hurts my face to be honest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried these on blackheads located on my nose with no success.  You must have to push VERY hard, which is painful, in order to push out the gunk.  I&#x27;ve used the different attachments and just couldn&#x27;t get it to work even after looking at videos online.  Maybe I have the wrong type of blackheads, or perhaps the product needs to be used by someone else for a better viewpoint.  Unsure, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I gave the item 2 stars because I did not receive the main body of the tool to which the attachments screw into.  However, the quality of the attachments are superb and definate upgrade from my last skin care product.</li>
    <li> Simply the best home dissection kit I&#x27;ve ever bought. Easy to use and easy to clean off the experiments. I bought one for me, and one for my lab assistant who generally agrees with the previous sentences I typed.</li>
    <li> This little case of comedone extractors allows me many options depending on the size of the comedone.  So far, I&#x27;ve had nothing but a good experience with it.  They also autoclave well.</li>
    <li> This set has everything that I need for my face. These tools make life so much easier than using your hands</li>
