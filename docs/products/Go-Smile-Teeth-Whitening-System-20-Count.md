      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is amazing to me that anyone says this works.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>The capsule method of keeping teeth from staining is effective.</li>
      <li>I wondered if this product would really be effective.</li>
      <li>Truly works and I believe easiest product of its kind to use.</li>
      <li>I really liked about the results were</li>
      <li>But this product did lighten my teeth considerably and painlessly and I am very happy with it.</li>

      <li>I guess they&#x27;re super good at marketing to stores.</li>
      <li>Love this OTC brand of whitening...</li>
      <li>it seems it works better if you&#x27;ve had your teeth</li>
      <li>I am fully satisfied with the return and refund process.</li>
      <li>I stopped using it and felt better.</li>
      <li>also wouldn&#x27;t hurt to get the lovely GoSmile toothpaste that the company also makes.)</li>
      <li>GoSmile said on its site that you should avoid touching your gums with this product, but swallowing is ok.</li>
      <li>Great product gave it to my daughter so she can get ready for her wedding</li>
      <li>But this is THE MOST CONVENIENT.</li>
      <li>I have had one filling at the dentist and decided I needed to take better care of my teeth.</li>
      <li>I also wanted them to look healthy</li>
      <li>You get a much much better result with the whitening strips from Crest and for a lot cheaper.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is authentic.  </li>
      <li>The whitening tubes work much better than their mint product.</li>
      <li>The reason I am writing this is to point out that most of the reviews about this product do not come from &amp;#34;verified purchasers&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I even suggest the toothpaste from Go Smile was refreshing and gave a nice wake-up to the day.</li>
      <li>(my teeth are very sensitive) finally an easy way to have a great smile!  </li>
      <li>A bit more spendy than most over the counter systems but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Also have to mention the convenience factor - easy to carry in your pocket or purse and use it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy, you&#x27;ll think it won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are easy to carry while I was on business</li>
      <li>Easy to use and works quickly!</li>
      <li>And less than 50 bucks is the best price point.</li>
      <li>It worked fine and I will keep using it.  </li>
      <li>Taste was fine also.</li>
      <li>and 7 days is quick!</li>
      <li>I hope there will be more Go Smile products that can be shipped abroad.</li>
      <li>My wedding is coming up, so I thought it would be a good time to find a cheap and easy option to get my teeth as white as I can!</li>
      <li>I have friends that have used the product for years and they have wonderful bight white smiles and no negative side effects.</li>
      <li>The application was super easy, but I don&#x27;t think they worked and didn&#x27;t notice a difference for the before and after.</li>
      <li>I like this quick easy method to keep my teeth brighter.</li>
      <li>These are so great, love my new white smile and they are so EASY to use!  </li>
      <li>I bought this item (the british version which is basically the same) after seeing good reviews and some people on YouTube give it great reviews as well.</li>
      <li>This worked great, especially when using with the go smile uv light</li>
      <li>Works so much better than Crest strips and not nearly as expensive as a dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product several times and have found it to be more effective that</li>
      <li>I use it once a week and for special occasions.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you really rub it in so it can get in all the pores in your enamel and also keep rubbing in circular motions even after all the liquid is used up</li>
      <li>Break the capsule, brush on, no bad flavor or taste.</li>
      <li>The serum burns a bit on the gum line, but dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>On the very first application, my teeth became whiter.</li>
      <li>it definitely whitens and what I love most is that the ingredients are safe for those of us with sensitive teeth...</li>
      <li>Tried first time on cruise and have used it since!  </li>
      <li>It just wasn&#x27;t worth the time and money.</li>
      <li>I rarely have time to write a review</li>
      <li>and, IMO, is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I used the product, 3 vials worth before returning for a refund.  </li>
      <li>When ever I want my smile to sparkle and shine I reach for my Go Smile product to get the job</li>
      <li>Use in the past and had great results.</li>
      <li>Easy with no mess or goo.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the lite brite teeth!</li>
      <li>This is day and night application and definitely not needed more than once every 3-4 weeks.</li>
      <li>This is much cheaper than going to the dentist for whitwning and it works!</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
      <li>The only part maybe I enjoyed was yet the breaking vial thing.</li>
      <li>They are literally worth every penny..and really, they aren&#x27;t that much!</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied because my teeth were whiter.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After the first application, I thought I noticed some difference - used for one application 3 days in a row and couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement.</li>
      <li>It is important to follow the instructions in so far as not eating or drinking for the specified period of time.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just to make money, if there are people still willing to buy it</li>
      <li>These work very well!</li>
      <li>; and he was right, despite how much I tried.</li>
      <li>Id rink too much coffee (non-smoker).   </li>
      <li>My teeth were REALLY stained from smoking and drinking</li>
      <li>it did not whiten my teeth , i am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. This is the only product that consistently whitens my teeth without any pain.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed with this product. It does nothing for the teeth whatsoever. Yeah I know it doesn&#x27;t hurt as other whitening systems do, but for the money your teeth are supposed to look better. In my case they weren&#x27;t. The application itself is also quite \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; and unpleasant. The tube was very hard to press as it is made of hard plastic (glass consistency and covered by carton) that you&#x27;re supposed to crack open with your fingers and then press, while at the same time applying the gel inside. Also, after only two days of using it, I started feeling my throat a bit sore. I stopped using it and felt better. GoSmile said on its site that you should avoid touching your gums with this product, but swallowing is ok. Hmmm....  I don&#x27;t recommend this product, it&#x27;s not good for your gums and is may not be good for your health. And it doesn&#x27;t whiten, so I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re still selling it. Maybe it&#x27;s just to make money, if there are people still willing to buy it (it sells at Sephora and bloomingdales). I guess they&#x27;re super good at marketing to stores.</li>
    <li> I rarely have time to write a review but if I love (or hate) a product, I try hard to find the time. All the other teeth whiteners I&#x27;ve used over the years always hurt my teeth. I wondered if this product would really be effective. If effective, I wondered if it would end up giving me at least some sensitivity. I am extremely happy to say that I experienced no sensitivity at all. On the very first application, my teeth became whiter. I was thrilled. Honestly, between fake reviews and overly hyped- products, I never get my hopes up on anything anymore. With Go Smile, each time I applied an ampoule, my teeth got a little whiter. I am 5 days (out of 7) into it at this point, and I can tell I will be ordering this product again. I once had a dentist tell me &amp;#34;your teeth will never be Mary Poppins white,&amp;#34; and he was right, despite how much I tried. But this product did lighten my teeth considerably and painlessly and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My teeth were yellow, YELLOW as a constant coffee and tea drinker I was horrified but could not give up my delish drinks. So I got this product. It promises your teeth will be six shades lighter but after six treatments my teeth are nearly perfect. I HONESTLY don&#x27;t see how this product could be any more amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It also wouldn&#x27;t hurt to get the lovely GoSmile toothpaste that the company also makes.)</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this works, but Good Hosekeeping recommends it so I am considering it.  The reason I am writing this is to point out that most of the reviews about this product do not come from &amp;#34;verified purchasers&amp;#34;.  Be careful.  Those reviews are probably just put in by the people who are selling the product.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.The application was super easy, but I don&#x27;t think they worked and didn&#x27;t notice a difference for the before and after. I was disappointed as I was hoping these would be good on the go vs. a strip.</li>
    <li> I like this quick easy method to keep my teeth brighter. The capsule method of keeping teeth from staining is effective.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use for my wedding.  It is amazing to me that anyone says this works.  It is runny and doesn&#x27;t stay on your teeth.  Did not whiten.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought mine directly from Sephora. I followed the instructions exactly. After one applicaion, my teeth were noticably whiter.  I alos purchased the touch up kit to use after coffee. There is no tooth or gum irritation. This is much cheaper than going to the dentist for whitwning and it works!</li>
    <li> A little disappointed in this product - thought it would whiten more than it did - in researching it seems it works better if you&#x27;ve had your teeth professional whitened already</li>
    <li> Thanks for the lite brite teeth!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Works so much better than Crest strips and not nearly as expensive as a dentist&#x27;s office. Easy to use and works quickly!</li>
    <li> I bought this item (the british version which is basically the same) after seeing good reviews and some people on YouTube give it great reviews as well. I have had one filling at the dentist and decided I needed to take better care of my teeth. I also wanted them to look healthy so I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I was a bit sceptical as to wether it worked and after 3-4 applications day and night I did notice a difference. The taste is rather unnoticeable and my teeth feel no different to normal. Not only did it brighten my smile but it also evened out the tone colours of my teeth so no teeth were different shades. Don&#x27;t expect dramatic results after the first application because the hydrogen peroxide levels in this product is lower than in some others so it will happen gradually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would point out to people buying this product is to dry your mouth of saliva first because it can get in the way/dilute the product on your teeth. Make sure you really rub it in so it can get in all the pores in your enamel and also keep rubbing in circular motions even after all the liquid is used up so you do a thorough job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also whitening products can only go so far. Every person&#x27;s enamel is a different colour so some people may not have as white teeth as others. If this doesn&#x27;t make your teeth as white as some celebrities then don&#x27;t get annoyed at the product. If you want teeth as white as snow then you&#x27;ll have to go to the dentist and pay ludicrous amounts of money. However, for home whitening, this is a good product to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again? Yes I probably would but I would try other products like Crest Strips first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10</li>
    <li> Great, prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I think it made a subtle difference but nothing great. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. It just wasn&#x27;t worth the time and money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. Save your money and pay for a professional whitening.</li>
    <li> These are so great, love my new white smile and they are so EASY to use!  After years of ineffective Crest Whitestrips and painful dentist whitening (my teeth are very sensitive) finally an easy way to have a great smile!  Try them you will LOVE them!</li>
    <li> It worked fine and I will keep using it.  Very easy to use and not at all messy.  Taste was fine also. Karen</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! No aching gums &amp; it&#x27;ll whiten your teeth like no other! Not to mention it&#x27;s a great price!</li>
    <li> I bought 3 boxes of this product from Sephora, back when it just came out. They had back then just the box that came with the DVD. I gave this product 1 star since, it just barely moved a tooth one level in color, and my teeth are not stained, only one is yellow cause Id rink too much coffee (non-smoker).   You get a much much better result with the whitening strips from Crest and for a lot cheaper.  I am still amazed this product is still goign on at sephora and QVC..etc, by now you would think everyone found out it&#x27;s just water + good packaging/vials. The only part maybe I enjoyed was yet the breaking vial thing.</li>
    <li> I hope there will be more Go Smile products that can be shipped abroad. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great whitening system. Easy with no mess or goo. Break the capsule, brush on, no bad flavor or taste. A bit more spendy than most over the counter systems but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product whitens my teeth in a matter of minutes.  When ever I want my smile to sparkle and shine I reach for my Go Smile product to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to do what it claims to do fully - very short term results</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Love this OTC brand of whitening...it definitely whitens and what I love most is that the ingredients are safe for those of us with sensitive teeth...all other brands of whiteners (i.e., Crest strips) along with dental quality whiteners cause major sensitivity - this product does not and it works!</li>
    <li> my sister had white teeth on her wedding day thank you</li>
    <li> This product did not improve the whiteness of my teeth even though I used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;However, it did not make my teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> Great product gave it to my daughter so she can get ready for her wedding</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times and have found it to be more effective that other whiteners sold at the drugstore. Within a few days my teeth are brighter and stains are fading.  I have not experienced any adverse side effects.  It is important to follow the instructions in so far as not eating or drinking for the specified period of time. I leave it on through the night.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This worked great, especially when using with the go smile uv light</li>
    <li> Great product!  Tried first time on cruise and have used it since!  This is the whitening system - the touch ups are different flavors (mint).  This is day and night application and definitely not needed more than once every 3-4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Get product and takes the stain of coffee and tea from your teeth and you can see them getting whiter.</li>
    <li> You know how you buy exercise equipment and then never use it? I bought some of these about 4 years ago before a move, and unearthed them from a box about 4 weeks ago. My teeth were REALLY stained from smoking and drinking coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first application, I thought I noticed some difference - used for one application 3 days in a row and couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement. The fact that the stuff is inside the breakable glass tube clearly supports a long shelf-life. Also have to mention the convenience factor - easy to carry in your pocket or purse and use it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m VERY surprised by the negative reviews. I use it after brushing my teeth and then wait at least 15-20 min before I drink or eat anything. I also don&#x27;t read directions so not sure whether you&#x27;re supposed to brush it off - but I just leave it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> The whitening system seems to work quite well.  It is somewhat difficult to break open and apply.  The whitening tubes work much better than their mint product.</li>
    <li> NO WONDER THIS WAS DISCOUNTED. IT DIDNT WORK AT ALL!!! TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!! I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK!!!!</li>
    <li> No surprise, it worked. It does make your teeth a bit sensitive. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These work very well! I&#x27;ve been using them for years, and always receive compliments on my smile, especially how pretty my teeth are.</li>
    <li> After using the Go Smile system for the 14 days, I definitely saw results! My teeth are whiter, especially around the gum line. It has been a month since using the product and my teeth have maintained their whiter shade, I do continue to brush with a teeth whiting toothpaste to keep the color going. I would recommend this product over crest white strips for ease of use and lasting results</li>
    <li> I need to preface my review with the fact that I have very, VERY sensitive teeth and gums. I used the product, 3 vials worth before returning for a refund.  I avoided my gums but the solution still made its way onto them and left my gums shredded, infected, inflamed and bleeding. My teeth also felt very sensitive after. I am fully satisfied with the return and refund process. I recommend not using this product if you know that you have major sensitivity. I have friends that have used the product for years and they have wonderful bight white smiles and no negative side effects.</li>
    <li> I completely go by this product. It is amazing. I have tried with those garbage white strips but they didn&#x27;t do anything for me, then I found these amazing little things. My dentist is even amazed at my smile!&lt;br /&gt;The key is to keep squeezing the tube to get the mixture to come out of the tip. Leave it on for 30+ minutes and rinse your mouth out with water. Don&#x27;t brush or use mouth wash or you&#x27;re just washing the mixture away. Use them consecutively. You will have perfectly white teeth!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using in the past molds which I had gotten from my dentist and truly never noticed a significant difference with these molds and certainly didn&#x27;t like the application method so I thought I would try an alternative to the tape methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was easy to apply and I only noticed that it was sensitive to my lips if they were very dry but it was only minimal.  The key is reading the directions on how to get the ampoule to work but once you figure this out the application was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really liked about the results were they were steady over the week and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have people notice the difference at the end of the week as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are easy to carry while I was on business and I will be buying again.  I even suggest the toothpaste from Go Smile was refreshing and gave a nice wake-up to the day.</li>
    <li> I tried whitening strips (not good for sensitive teeth and made me drool like crazy), and I can&#x27;t afford the Zoom whitening treatments at my dentist&#x27;s office. My wedding is coming up, so I thought it would be a good time to find a cheap and easy option to get my teeth as white as I can! I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice and I&#x27;m sharing each ampoule with my fiance. There is plenty of serum stuff in it for 2 people. We&#x27;re only on the 3rd day, and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference! It doesn&#x27;t taste like anything, there is just a mild tingling, and the only restriction is you can&#x27;t eat, drink, or rinse for 20 minutes after applying. It&#x27;s SO easy, and if you don&#x27;t have bad stains like we do, it works quickly. I would definitely use it again!</li>
    <li> Use in the past and had great results. Not so much this time, which makes me wonder if this generic.? My packages appears to have been reheat sealed, and box was torn from previous opening, you could also tell it had been opened by the tape on the end of the box.  Very questionable. Makes you wonder could this product have been old too.....</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before but not from this seller. The product did not seem to be the same. The ampules did not contain as much product and dried up quickly. I didn&#x27;t have the same results either. It did create sensitivity with my teeth. I don&#x27;t think this product is authentic.  I was very pleased with the product I bought from another seller (which I don&#x27;t remember) and am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used crest white strips and done the trays in the past, but this product is legit. I did NOT believe I wouldn&#x27;t have sensitivity after using it as my teeth are highly sensitive for months after using any other whitening product. But honestly, this is the best whitening system I&#x27;ve ever found. And it&#x27;s better than paying hundreds and hundreds to have it done in the dentist chair! It&#x27;s so easy, you&#x27;ll think it won&#x27;t work. But I didn&#x27;t even have to use half of ONE kit to get the whitest teeth I&#x27;ve ever seen. I am asked all the time how my teeth are so white and it&#x27;s three things: I don&#x27;t drink a lot of things that stain, I brush 2 to 3 times a day with a sonic-care, and I use this product. But truthfully, I have only ever used half of one kit! It works that well, I have not had the need to keep using it. I wish I could hug the person who invented these. They are literally worth every penny..and really, they aren&#x27;t that much!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for sh*t</li>
    <li> This very good to have. It does an excellent job. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use and take no time at all !  The results are visible in a few applications!</li>
    <li> This works as intended but burns your gums and lips.</li>
    <li> I already have a mouth piece from another teeth whitening system I use to use, but no longer sell. I use it while I&#x27;m doing my GOSMILE. I divided the package of 20 in halve. Last year for a wedding I did two weeks worth and my teeth were amazing! I couldn&#x27;t stop smiling. I&#x27;m starting on the rest because I like to do it when i tan, its spring here. You have to use the product properly, and have patience. Some areas of my gums sting, and turn white later red, but goes away. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied because my teeth were whiter.  :D I&#x27;m a married 33 year old mother of two.</li>
    <li> It does what it is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Best whitening product I&#x27;ve ever used. Simple and quick. And less than 50 bucks is the best price point. I will not pay 100 bucks for this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other products that are stronger. Or work a little faster. But this is THE MOST CONVENIENT. and 7 days is quick! And I think this last the longest.</li>
    <li> Best whitening product on market.  Been using it since early 2000.</li>
    <li> tubes may be old; a bit dry</li>
    <li> it did not whiten my teeth , i am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectations but this product did not meet them.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all on me!!!</li>
    <li> Truly works and I believe easiest product of its kind to use.</li>
    <li> I was amazed this product worked so well as I have fairly white teeth. The serum burns a bit on the gum line, but dissipates quickly. I noticed a difference after 2 treatments.</li>
    <li> Good product does the job.</li>
    <li> On my 2nd application with the stick, I felt a burning sensation &amp; looked in a mirror &amp; my gums that edged my teeth were white from being burnt from the solution. .?????</li>
    <li> We have used this product for a few years and I love it.  I use it once a week and for special occasions.  It keeps my teeth noticeably whiter and, IMO, is well worth the price.</li>
