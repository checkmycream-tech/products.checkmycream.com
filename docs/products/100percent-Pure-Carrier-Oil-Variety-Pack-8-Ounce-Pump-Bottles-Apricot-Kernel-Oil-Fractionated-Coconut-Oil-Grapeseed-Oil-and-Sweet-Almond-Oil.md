    <li> I like these and for the price they are a fair deal.  The Coconut and Almond are labeled organic and highest grade.  The Grapeseed is highest grade available, but is not labeled organic which seems reasonable and honest if you know a little about Grapeseed oil.  My only disappointment was that the Apricot oil was cosmetic grade.  I expected better Apricot oil.  Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> GREAT oils for the price.Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>

    <li> great products..... love them!</li>
    <li> These fell great and were actually much larger bottles than I was expecting.  It will take me a while to get through all of these.  Great variety and you can feel a difference in each.  I&#x27;m glad I went with this variety.</li>
    <li> each one is very good</li>
    <li> Great Variety Pack...wish it was still available!</li>

    <li> This product arrived on time and is wonderful to use!</li>
    <li> Horrible!!! The oils were rancid.The smell was horrific</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like these before.  I just recently started using Young Living oils and I needed carrier oils.  I have tried each of these oils, they are all unscented, light and don&#x27;t leave an oily feel on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love love love these oils. I will definitely be buying again when mine run out!</li>
