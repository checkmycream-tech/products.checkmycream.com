      <li>like many things do.</li>
      <li>great product , fast shipping.</li>
      <li>patience :) works though</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>Have used this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is a better option.  </li>
      <li>I fnd this product works every bit as well as the $70.00 product I bought from my dermatologist and smells better as well, not as strong.</li>
      <li>I love this as it really does a nice job</li>
      <li>so I use this for light sunspots and dark circles but because it&#x27;s so good</li>
      <li>It’s not a fast acting treatment as it is very mild and gentle (good for more sensitive skin) but its great silky texture and high moisture content will ensure that you use it daily which makes it really affected.  </li>
      <li>My first tube was given to me by a friend who said it didn&#x27;t work for her hands.</li>
      <li>It really, really works!</li>
      <li>The Vita-K for acne scars actually works better.</li>
      <li>it has one ingredient missing, which the most important.</li>
      <li>The price is pretty much equivalent (i.e. within pennies).</li>
      <li>a moisturizer I end up using it on my whole face not just my problem areas.  </li>
      <li>Not only works on spots but also makes her skin smooth.</li>
      <li>The only other place I&#x27;ve been able to find this product consistently is Walmart and there isn&#x27;t one very close to where I live so for me</li>
      <li>ok I guess - seems to work a little to lighten, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
      <li>To my amazement, it completely took them away!</li>
      <li>This really worked on the age spots on the back of my hands!</li>

    <li> This smells pretty bad, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin- like many things do. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in fading of age spots yet over the past 3 weeks or so I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be helping with a dark spot on my cheek.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and I&#x27;d say the spot has lightened about 30 %.  I use it morning and night.  It is odorless which is a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> This really worked on the age spots on the back of my hands! It lightens them and some totally disappeared!</li>
    <li> I love this product! My first tube was given to me by a friend who said it didn&#x27;t work for her hands. I didn&#x27;t use it on my hands--I used it for very dark areas on either sides of my neck. To my amazement, it completely took them away! I was thrilled! Of course, once they are gone, you must wear SPF to keep them away, as with any spot product. I have been lax in that department and they have somewhat returned over the summer, but I have no doubt that they will again be gone before summer returns. I recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> ok I guess - seems to work a little to lighten, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Works very very slowly.  The Vita-K for acne scars actually works better.</li>

    <li> patience :) works though</li>
    <li> It is working, though very slowly. If you are expecting results overnight or in a week, this is not for you. But when you think about it, the spots took a while to show up. So, the product works, just not immediately.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.  Not only works on spots but also makes her skin smooth.</li>
    <li> great product , fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I saw a noticeable improvement after a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> This not the same Vita K I used to buy... it has one ingredient missing, which the most important.</li>
    <li> Great product goes on smooth.  Improves skin tone and texture</li>
    <li> I bought this a while back from Rite Aid but was not able to find it again. It works great at reducing the appearance of age spots. I just bought it again online. I love this as it really does a nice job</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, works really good on age spots.</li>
