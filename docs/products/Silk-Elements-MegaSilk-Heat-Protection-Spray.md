      <li>Lea es My hair softer and kind of silky.</li>
      <li>I love touching my hair!</li>
      <li>I have tried many leave on conditioners and hair protectors and this one is by far the best !  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4  starts because of the inconvenience of not being able to use it when I needed it.</li>
      <li>I was able to get it at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply for about seven dollars.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>I use it this way to avoid a greasy look: 3 sprays in the palm of my hand then scrunch it in my hair.</li>
      <li>It is fantastic!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair shine and look healthy.</li>
      <li>I love feeling my hair,</li>
      <li>After using morrocain oil products for years, i found something cheaper and much better.</li>
      <li>great product, leaves hair soft and manageable</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and am happy with the results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, or leave the hair stiff, plus it smell great!</li>
      <li>My hair was shiny, smooth and bouncy for the first time in my life!</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing, and my hair is always soft.</li>
      <li>How ever applying too much will make your hair greasy so go easy with the application.&lt;br /&gt;Spray</li>
      <li>It smells a bit like baby powder and is very overbearing right when it is sprayed but after ironed the scent settles into a light clean scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Either way, $17 would be worth it to me.</li>
      <li>This is a powerful spray.</li>
      <li>, I can see if I were to use more then a tiny bit, it would look greasy.</li>
      <li>After using this for 5 days my hair has stopped breaking as much!</li>
      <li>great on thick and curly hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good heat protection for months and all of them have either left hair crunchy or strange smelling.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really protecting my hair</li>
      <li>I am VERY picky with scents and this one is doable.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t straightened my hair or blowdry it very often, but using this product really DOES protect against heat damage.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sooooo soft!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;PS: until my new town finally built a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store, I was about to pay $17.00 from Amazon because it is THAT amazing, and I was running low.</li>
      <li>the product itself is great, ive been using the same bottle for the past two years.</li>
      <li>I went back to Sally to buy the full size.</li>
      <li>It  leaves my  hair soft and silky smooth instantly!</li>
      <li>Baby soft!!</li>
      <li>it far from your head because it&#x27;s very misty and concentrated.</li>
      <li>once on my left and once in the back and brush it through, when I&#x27;m done blow drying my hair, I have no more frizz or static in my hair!!</li>
      <li>I tried this today for the first time after getting a sample size for 3 bucks at sallys, and my only complaint is the smell is strong at first.</li>
      <li>Leaves my relaxed hair silky and soft!</li>
      <li>I use this product with a flat iron comb and my hair gets straight, shiner, and soft!</li>
      <li>, if you have a sensitive nose, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
      <li>Also, my hair does not straighten very well but with this spray the style definitely holds.</li>
      <li>The oil isn&#x27;t a problem for me though since I have a naturally dryer texture of hair.</li>
      <li>If you get oily hair, you put to much, or your hair just feels flat and won&#x27;t curl</li>
      <li>It is so worth the cost, it last a long time!!!</li>
      <li>and then it takes to too much heat to dry which defeats the purpose of the spray.</li>
      <li>I would think if you have real dry hair you would put a little more on then me, but still you don&#x27;t need much, this bottle should last me a long time, plus it wash my hair every 4 days.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair is and with only a couple of sprays.</li>
      <li>I flat iron my hair frequently and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have coarse, naturally curly hair and flat iron</li>
      <li>It left my long hair soft and shiny</li>

<li> so soft, no more dry feel!!!</li>
<li> Great product that I won&#x27;t use anymore because of the nasty over powering smell.</li>
<li> Others I&#x27;ve tried just make the hair wet</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> , i feel like it is extremely moustiorizing</li>
<li> One down side: it smokes up A LOT..</li>
<li> After spraying it on, even before applying heat, it already feels less frizzy and silky.</li>
<li> , you just need a little..</li>
<li> I have a few split ends that would normally not be able to be slicked down but with a little spritz on my ends you would never know.</li>
<li> , I rec&#x27;d the initial product with a broken nozzle and it wouldn&#x27;t spray, and some of the product had leaked.</li>
<li> I almost just went in and wrote a bad review because I really needed to use it on the morning</li>
<li> I have a curly texture and everything that &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for my hair makes it either greasy or heavy!</li>
<li> It is about half gone!!</li>
<li> Rememer you just need a little!!</li>
<li> You just need a little bit!!</li>
<li> I have thick Caucasian hair.</li>
<li> I have VERY thick, frizzy (Caucasian) hair.</li>
<li> the smell is just awful, it reminds me and everyone who smells my hair of old lady perfume.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
<li> too expensive tried to xx</li>
<li> Too bad it smells disgusting like aqua net hair spray!</li>
<li> My hair was breaking really bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have tried many leave on conditioners and hair protectors and this one is by far the best !  It  leaves my  hair soft and silky smooth instantly!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Lea es My hair softer and kind of silky. Also shiny.</li>
    <li> Godo product and excellent supplier</li>
    <li> The product is good as well. I&#x27;ve used it for years; it was recommended to me.</li>
    <li> too expensive tried to xx order but was not allowed to do so</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product. I have tried EVERY heat protection spray on the market. This one beats them all. The smell is amazing, and my hair is always soft. I have VERY thick, frizzy (Caucasian) hair. After spraying it on, even before applying heat, it already feels less frizzy and silky. But after I blowdry/straighten/use the curling wand, it feels like actual silk. My hair has been coloured multiple times, but this product does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: until my new town finally built a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store, I was about to pay $17.00 from Amazon because it is THAT amazing, and I was running low. However, just in time, Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store opened out here, and i bought it for $7.00. Score! So look to see if you can find a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store by you, first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, $17 would be worth it to me. I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> It is fantastic! I can tell that it is protecting my hair from the heat. Also, my hair does not straighten very well but with this spray the style definitely holds. I have a few split ends that would normally not be able to be slicked down but with a little spritz on my ends you would never know. One down side: it smokes up A LOT.. but I promise that its just the product smoking and not your hair. Also, it is scented and I personally like the smell (as do my sister and mom) but some people may not like it.&lt;br /&gt;Just a side note that may help: I am African-American and my hair is fairly coarse</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works wonders! I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair is and with only a couple of sprays. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really protecting my hair (I hope so) but it feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, naturally curly hair and flat iron it often. I have tried many heat protection sprays but this one works the best on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, or leave the hair stiff, plus it smell great! Others I&#x27;ve tried just make the hair wet and then it takes to too much heat to dry which defeats the purpose of the spray.</li>
    <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been searching for a good heat protection for months and all of them have either left hair crunchy or strange smelling. I tried this today for the first time after getting a sample size for 3 bucks at sallys, and my only complaint is the smell is strong at first.

It left my long hair soft and shiny, i feel like it is extremely moustiorizing</li>
    <li> My hairdresser stands by this product.  I like the way it makes my hair feel.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and am happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I rec&#x27;d the initial product with a broken nozzle and it wouldn&#x27;t spray, and some of the product had leaked. I almost just went in and wrote a bad review because I really needed to use it on the morning I found out it wouldn&#x27;t spray. I contacted the seller, instead, and rec&#x27;d a replacement and it came quicker than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4  starts because of the inconvenience of not being able to use it when I needed it.</li>
    <li> This product is a life savor!!! I have a curly texture and everything that &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for my hair makes it either greasy or heavy! I use this product with a flat iron comb and my hair gets straight, shiner, and soft! I am forever hook and would recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t straightened my hair or blowdry it very often, but using this product really DOES protect against heat damage. The only downside for some is that it can leave an oily residue afterwards. The oil isn&#x27;t a problem for me though since I have a naturally dryer texture of hair.</li>
    <li> My stylist use this in my hair, it is a good heat protector and a shine. I will always us this for my family. Thank you silk elements!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I straighten my hair every day and would never leave home without it. It is a staple in my home. I have thick Caucasian hair.</li>
    <li> the product itself is great, ive been using the same bottle for the past two years. it leaves a nice shine and makes my hair feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;however, if you have a sensitive nose, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. the smell is just awful, it reminds me and everyone who smells my hair of old lady perfume.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective if used sparingly. It makes my hair shine and look healthy. I use it this way to avoid a greasy look: 3 sprays in the palm of my hand then scrunch it in my hair. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> After using morrocain oil products for years, i found something cheaper and much better.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!! You just need a little bit!! I spray once on my left side, once on my left and once in the back and brush it through, when I&#x27;m done blow drying my hair, I have no more frizz or static in my hair!! It&#x27;s sooooo soft!!! I have oily hair, that&#x27;s why I use just a tiny bit, I can see if I were to use more then a tiny bit, it would look greasy. I love touching my hair! Running my fingers through it!! Baby soft!! I would think if you have real dry hair you would put a little more on then me, but still you don&#x27;t need much, this bottle should last me a long time, plus it wash my hair every 4 days. Hope my review helped :) have a great day!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/9/2015- still loving this stuff!!!! I have the same bottle I bought!! It is about half gone!! It is so worth the cost, it last a long time!!! Rememer you just need a little!! If you get oily hair, you put to much, or your hair just feels flat and won&#x27;t curl, you just need a little.. I still have never sprayed it on my dry hair before curling, I put it in my damp hair before I blow dry it.. I love feeling my hair, so soft, no more dry feel!!! A must have!!! If you have dry hair or using irons and drying your hair a lot.</li>
    <li> great product, leaves hair soft and manageable</li>
    <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
    <li> Great product! !! I was able to get it at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply for about seven dollars.</li>
    <li> great on thick and curly hair</li>
    <li> Too bad it smells disgusting like aqua net hair spray! I wish they would consider changing the scent! If they would it would be the perfect product! My hair was shiny, smooth and bouncy for the first time in my life! Great product that I won&#x27;t use anymore because of the nasty over powering smell.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful spray. It is also oily so it leaves you with a great shine. How ever applying too much will make your hair greasy so go easy with the application.&lt;br /&gt;Spray it far from your head because it&#x27;s very misty and concentrated. You don&#x27;t want it landing all in one place.</li>
    <li> I bought the travel size just to try  it out. I went back to Sally to buy the full size. It is amazing! I flat iron my hair frequently and&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t using a heat protector.  My hair was breaking really bad.  After using this for 5 days my hair has stopped breaking as much! I&#x27;m in love! If your hair is already oily this is not for you. If it is dry like mine then buy it! A little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s not sticky. Leaves my relaxed hair silky and soft!</li>
