<li> That is where at least 2 or 3 of those washes are wasted.</li>
<li> Impossible to find locally.</li>
<li> Worthless product, stops dispensing when half empty.</li>
<li> , also the can gets real slick when trying to reapply the soap.</li>

    <li> Worthless product, stops dispensing when half empty.</li>
    <li> Great service-great product</li>
    <li> Works good, however runs out of aerosol before empty</li>
    <li> Love it !  Smells fantastic and easy to use foaming soap.  Impossible to find locally.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  This is an English import sold under another name in the UK.  I first learned of it while on business there.  I only wish they sold the scents in the UK that they sell here.  The Dial branded scenes have ambiguous names that don&#x27;t tell you a lot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a shaving cream at first but then foams up . I like it, but then again I don&#x27;t.  The soap is great and smells good but it seems like I use to much of it during a shower, also the can gets real slick when trying to reapply the soap.</li>
    <li> Item as promised, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for traveling.  I got it as a gift and thought I wouldn&#x27;t use it.  I put it in my travel bag and when I use it the first time I decided to get more!</li>
    <li> It is a completely great product, just remember you do have to use a washcloth, also the red color is quite unfortunate. I much prefer Blue and Green because they make it feel a lot less like the shower scene from Psycho when using. Also, do not use it as bubble bath. Very bad idea.</li>
    <li> Liked the clean masculine smell. Feels vey good on skin when foams up. I rate the product highly.</li>
    <li> great stuff, so sorry Dial has discontinued it.  I think they chose the wrong test markets or did not let it run long enough to catch on.</li>
    <li> smell nice, good product just poor propellant. After a few uses the soap only just comes out, run can under hot tap it comes out faster but doesnt generally have good propellant properties.  I bought 12 of them and its the same with the first five</li>
    <li> I wish I could still buy this locally.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Will order more when I&#x27;m running low.</li>
    <li> Can advertises 40 washes. Really only about 25 washes.  Love the product though.  Dial needs to get the product to stop oozing out after use.  That is where at least 2 or 3 of those washes are wasted.</li>
    <li> th e best suds  the best  soap for the money  the  best for travel  very easy to use and smells great</li>
    <li> Wish I could still buy this at the store, was more economical.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff, I use to buy it locally and when they stopped I went to Amazon. That&#x27;s how much I love it.  I can get about 50 washes out of it. I&#x27;ve usually used the green but I&#x27;m trying the red.</li>
    <li> smells like shaving cream still</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
