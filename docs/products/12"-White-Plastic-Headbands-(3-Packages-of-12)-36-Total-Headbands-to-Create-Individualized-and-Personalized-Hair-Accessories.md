<li> They were thick enough that they didn&#x27;t break, even on adult size heads</li>
<li> They aren&#x27;t too tight at the ears for adults and aren&#x27;t too big for girls.</li>
<li> Not much to say, 1/2&amp;#34; plastic headbands.</li>
<li> They stay on your head and are not too tight.</li>
<li> Ordered these headbands to make Mickey Mouse ears for my little girls birthday party.</li>
<li> Made favors for 2 little girls birthday parties with these headbands.  </li>
<li> plastice is very hard.</li>

<li> I used them as the base for crowns, and used the extras for myself!</li>

    <li> Excellent.  Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and snap in half easily.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the quality of the headbands I received, but they were the wrong size. The description clearly states they were 1/2&amp;#34; (inch). The headbands I received are clearly marked 5mm (1/2cm). That&#x27;s a big difference. I assume I could have returned them but they worked okay for my purpose so I kept them.</li>
    <li> I cant wait to work with these. plastice is very hard.</li>
    <li> Ecactly what is was supposed to be and I got them in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> Sturdy, great for making &amp;#34;ears&amp;#34; for kids costumes and THE BEST price that I could find</li>
    <li> Tapered but will use them</li>
    <li> I was expected really cheap quality but they are actually really hefty. I used them as the base for crowns, and used the extras for myself! They are very comfortable and durable.</li>

    <li> These were pretty awesome! I made them into fairy crowns for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. All the girls including adults will be wearing one :)</li>
    <li> I like the sturdiness of them but I wish they were 1/2 all the way around and not just at the middle</li>
    <li> Used them for adults and kids. Very sturdy and priced well. They aren&#x27;t too tight at the ears for adults and aren&#x27;t too big for girls.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, 1/2&amp;#34; plastic headbands. Cheapies but exactly what I was looking for. They have to be covered still, but they we&#x27;re offered at a price that allows for that!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly. Packaged neatly. They aren&#x27;t flimsy which I was afraid of. Perfect for making headbands.</li>
    <li> Made favors for 2 little girls birthday parties with these headbands.  They worked great except they were pretty cheap quality.  No teeth on the headband or a cushion at the end, basically just a curved piece of white plastic.  They were thick enough that they didn&#x27;t break, even on adult size heads</li>
    <li> Perfect for craft project.  A bit flimsy but unless you wear it daily they hold up well.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quality of these headbands.  We used them to make Teddy Bear ears for an event. Liked that the band&#x27;s did not have teeth. They were very comfortable to wear.</li>

    <li> I bought these to make custom bunny ears. Since I&#x27;m covering them, they are perfect for what I need them for...&lt;br /&gt;But I would have been very disappointed if I really needed them to be white, because the ones that I received were more of a light grey...</li>

    <li> I purchased these headbands to use for balloon headbands and they worked perfectly for what I needed.  The headbands feel sturdy, are fairly durable, and have no teeth on them so the balloons did not snag or pop in any way.

They come in a pack of 36, so I was able to get a headband for everyone in the party!  These headbands were so great that I ordered them again - I will definitely keep these in mind for future headband crafts - they&#x27;re great!</li>
