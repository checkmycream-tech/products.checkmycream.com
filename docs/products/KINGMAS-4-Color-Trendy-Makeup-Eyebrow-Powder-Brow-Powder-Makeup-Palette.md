      <li>Very good powder hhe brush is not a eyebrow brush but it is good for other things</li>
      <li>LOVEEEEE this so much its the best hahaha!</li>
      <li>I was hesitant but it is actually pretty good.</li>
      <li>The product its self was great and looked natural on my eyebrows!</li>
      <li>I combine this powder with Prestige Cosmetics Brow Perfection Revitalizing Clear Brow Gel also from Amazon and am very pleased with the results!</li>
      <li>Went on perfectly the first time I used it, and by combining the second and third colors, it is the perfect shade.  </li>
      <li>Creamy texture is easy to spply.</li>
      <li>I use this for the eyebrows works fine.</li>
      <li>Packaging and delivery were fine.</li>
      <li>The colors are great, I&#x27;m definitely reordering this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was do excited to get this palette for my eyebrows</li>
      <li>Overall truly love the brow kit, I do not use the brushes inside as I have my own eyebrow brush I like to use.</li>
      <li>Mine came in perfect, its not like regular brow shadow its super soft idk if that makes sense.</li>
      <li>I use the second one from the left for my eyebrows and it&#x27;s the perfect colour.</li>
      <li>its so simple yet fantastic though I do wish there was a bit more color option for</li>
      <li>if you dab your eyebrow brush a little on water and then use whichever brow powder you use the after look is amazing!</li>
      <li>You can mix the colors for a lighter or darker tone, but it stayed all day long and looks pretty nice, not so overdone.</li>
      <li>The grey and black have glitter on this palette, The browns work great!!</li>
      <li>They look more grayish in the picture in reality they are to brown for me since I&#x27;m a blonde</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Love these definitely recommended</li>
      <li>I had always used pencils before, which looked exactly like a PENCIL over my brows</li>
      <li>My brows are dark and a little sparse in areas, and this product fills them in and they look really great and most importantly, natural!  </li>
      <li>what they really are don&#x27;t like the powder texture also.</li>
      <li>so I use them for a gentle highlighter under my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Like the brush it comes with but do not like the colores so much they look darker then</li>
      <li>My box was very beaten up.</li>
      <li>I didnt even notice it until 2 and a half weeks of using it that makes it even better one thing though I do wish</li>
      <li>I highly HIGHLY suggest this eyebrow palette.</li>
      <li>This comes out really matte and looks natural.</li>
      <li>I like natural looking eyebrows</li>
      <li>mainly use only two colors</li>
      <li>The brow powder is much darker than I expected.</li>
      <li>I will order this again in the near future.</li>
      <li>The powders are magic for my brows, and they don&#x27;t get all dusty every time you use it.</li>
      <li>I wet my brush and use it that way and normally when I&#x27;d do that with other palettes they&#x27;d come out shiny and really glittery despite having no glitter in them.</li>
      <li>Long lasting and natural looking.</li>
      <li>the colors are really blendable, the only thing that i didnt like was the little brush.</li>
      <li>and I was not able to custom blend the color which always looked either too light or too dark.  </li>

<li> Not good if you try both</li>

<li> I was so mad</li>
<li> Very disappointing</li>
<li> I received this broken!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Excellent, it works perfect. I love it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this.... I was do excited to get this palette for my eyebrows but when it arrived the 3rd one was smashed and there was powder everywhere on the front I was so mad never again I do not recommend and read all the comments before buying.</li>
    <li> They color faddes off withing an,hour</li>
    <li> Long lasting and natural looking.</li>
    <li> It was packaged very well but somehow the little mirror got broken. Not a big deal - Im very pleased with the shadows.</li>
    <li> Loooooove this mini pallet. The powders are magic for my brows, and they don&#x27;t get all dusty every time you use it.</li>
    <li> i thought it was an actual brand i was buying from.</li>
    <li> One color broken. No labeling on product inner or outer box telling you if it is for eyes or brows! Not good if you try both and you find out you are allergic on your eyes!</li>
    <li> The grey and black have glitter on this palette, The browns work great!! if you dab your eyebrow brush a little on water and then use whichever brow powder you use the after look is amazing!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend this product! took forever to arrive!</li>
    <li> Good product and great costumer service!</li>
    <li> Love these definitely recommended</li>
    <li> Very good powder hhe brush is not a eyebrow brush but it is good for other things</li>
    <li> I was hesitant but it is actually pretty good. You can mix the colors for a lighter or darker tone, but it stayed all day long and looks pretty nice, not so overdone.</li>
    <li> I received this broken!!! I wasn&#x27;t too happy about it but it could still be usable. I will not purchase from this company again!!!! The product its self was great and looked natural on my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> I like it, good quality and can mix colors.</li>
    <li> good eyebrow kit. I like natural looking eyebrows and this is a good powder for that type of look. good value.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! it is just how it looks in the picture!! and not only can you use it for ur eyebrows u can use it for eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> Good product for the price will recommend to friends</li>
    <li> The black was broken when I received. I do not think this was their fault though. My box was very beaten up. So I think it broke during shipping. 4 stars bc the product is ok.</li>
    <li> It okay. ...doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> The brow powder is much darker than I expected. I will not be able to use it.</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEE this so much its the best hahaha! its so simple yet fantastic though I do wish there was a bit more color option for when I use it on my friends for me its perfect my eyebrows have never looked so nice also id like to add I LOVE that theres a sponge on the end of the brush I didnt even notice it until 2 and a half weeks of using it that makes it even better one thing though I do wish the angled brush was a bit stiffer other than that BEAUTIFULL Ill definitely order again!</li>
    <li> One of the shades in the pallet arrived broken, and Eyebrow brush that comes with pallet isn&#x27;t worth anything. But fixing the broken pallet was a quick fix. Beside that shades work well.</li>
    <li> Like this small palette. I use this for the eyebrows works fine. Im still learning how to fill my eyebrows though.</li>
    <li> I really really love this palette. I use the second one from the left for my eyebrows and it&#x27;s the perfect colour. I wet my brush and use it that way and normally when I&#x27;d do that with other palettes they&#x27;d come out shiny and really glittery despite having no glitter in them. This comes out really matte and looks natural. I highly HIGHLY suggest this eyebrow palette. I will order this again in the near future.</li>
    <li> Got so many compliments when using this it&#x27;s great even the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. Mine came in perfect, its not like regular brow shadow its super soft idk if that makes sense. The colors are great, I&#x27;m definitely reordering this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I reordered on Feb 19th 2015 and 8 months later NOTHING. I NEVER received it so im going from 5 starts to 1. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow palette. It was my very first and it works great. My hair is very dark so I had to use The black powder, the rest of colors just blend into my skin so I use them for a gentle highlighter under my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I have dark black eyebrows and have a hard time finding eyebrow powder to match that doesn&#x27;t make it too dark or look awfuly light. With this I&#x27;m able to blend the colors to achieve the perfect color. Obviously for the price its not the best quality but I combined it with nyx eyebrow wax and it helps it last all day!</li>
    <li> the colors are really blendable, the only thing that i didnt like was the little brush.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Nice colors and perfect stay</li>
    <li> Nice selection of color pallette.Creamy texture is easy to spply.Like better than brow pencil.Would recommend. Packaging and delivery were fine.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and it works great love how it looks on my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> They look more grayish in the picture in reality they are to brown for me since I&#x27;m a blonde but it&#x27;s very nice to work with it!&lt;br /&gt;I like it</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product</li>
    <li> Best brow cover ever! I saw all 5 star reviews and had to try it.  I had always used pencils before, which looked exactly like a PENCIL over my brows and I was not able to custom blend the color which always looked either too light or too dark.  Problem solved with KingMas!!! Went on perfectly the first time I used it, and by combining the second and third colors, it is the perfect shade.  I will not be using the black except for use as a liner.  My brows are dark and a little sparse in areas, and this product fills them in and they look really great and most importantly, natural!  I combine this powder with Prestige Cosmetics Brow Perfection Revitalizing Clear Brow Gel also from Amazon and am very pleased with the results! My brows never looked better, honestly!</li>
    <li> Like the brush it comes with but do not like the colores so much they look darker then what they really are don&#x27;t like the powder texture also.</li>
    <li> Overall truly love the brow kit, I do not use the brushes inside as I have my own eyebrow brush I like to use. I may use one brush to powder my eyes after I apply eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use only two colors not sure if I am to blend the colors?</li>
    <li> This gone here wayyyy before it said it would! Love it! Works great!!(:</li>
    <li> Only problem I had was that the brush wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Very good, and the colors are true lights and true darks.</li>
