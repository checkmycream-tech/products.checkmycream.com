      <li>and there they were; 3 twin packs totaling 6 sticks, which makes this a fantastic deal!</li>
      <li>Great product, thanks.</li>
      <li>What isn&#x27;t okay is the deceptive title.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I never have to think out making sure it is on the list.</li>
      <li>And...it&#x27;s cheap!  </li>
      <li>Made my stinky son smell better.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Twin Pack\\&quot;--Indicates 3 per order (or 6 sticks) for over $11.00  -- pretty good Deal.  </li>
      <li>First I loved it because of how he smelled, and one day I ran out of mine and started using his</li>
      <li>Keeps me dry and the scent is awesome for men.</li>
      <li>Not only does it work great, but it has a really nice scent too.  </li>
      <li>Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon</li>
      <li>gets you some Degree toot sweet!</li>
      <li>That would have been a good deal at $12, since where I live this product sells for about $4 a stick and sometimes is on</li>
      <li>The deodorant itself is fine.</li>
      <li>The product is fine.</li>
      <li>I received my deoderants really quick!</li>
      <li>I was able to return them for free and was quickly credited.</li>
      <li>What a HUGE LIE this product is.</li>
      <li>Got it cheap</li>

      <li>overall, I think the service was great.</li>
      <li>The price is great over retail, but realize that you&#x27;re ordering 6 total sticks.</li>
      <li>sale Buy one get one free, or about $2 a stick, which I thought was the price.</li>
      <li>Keeps my man smelling clean and not stinky.</li>
      <li>I hope Amazon&#x27;s &#x27;review&#x27; gets all of us our full order eventually.</li>
      <li>Product itself is good, though not always necessarily invisible -- perhaps it&#x27;s because the boyfriend likes to cake it on himself!</li>
      <li>Degree is a tried and true champion of the deodorant world.  </li>
      <li>It comes in Clean and Fresh scents.</li>
      <li>I guess I got lucky as I got 6 deodorants unlike three a lot of people are complaining about.</li>
      <li>They are resending the order, so I revert to my opinion previous to this incident, that this is a great deal.  </li>
      <li>which will happen first!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First of all, while I don&#x27;t believe there is any room for misinterpretation when they state \\&quot;twin pack, pack of 3\\&quot;, I might say they are simply stating it in a confusing way and truly just mean 3.  However, at least 2 other places on the page they specifically state that it is 6 sticks.  When I contacted customer service, I was told that I ordered 3 sticks, not 6.  I call bull on that.  While I appreciate that they are willing to correct MY ERROR, I want them to correct THEIR ERROR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Next day, I heard back from customer service again.  They are resending the order, so I revert to my opinion previous to this incident, that this is a great deal.  Good job, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I was scared because of the reviews that people only got 3 sticks, when it clearly advertised 6 in the first line of the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Case of three packages, each containing two 2.7-ounce deodorant sticks (total of 6 sticks)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t read the reviews until after I purchased (I know bad habit) and was worried.  I was totally prepared to file my refund when the package came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened it up and there they were; 3 twin packs totaling 6 sticks, which makes this a fantastic deal! Less than $2 a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and hopefully I never get the 3 stick box ever.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Its sad that, as a chick, I have to wear guy&#x27;s deodorant.... but it works.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy for those who use Degree. The price is better than supermarkets and convenience stores. What a great buy!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant for my boyfriend and I am so glad I did!  Not only do we not have to buy deodorant for about six months, but it is WAY cheaper from this seller than ANY store.  This deodorant works GREAT (according to my boyfriend) and I lovelovelove the fragrance of it!  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> The price is great over retail, but realize that you&#x27;re ordering 6 total sticks. Have used these for a few years now and the faint smell is nice but not really noticeable. Perhaps I&#x27;m using it wrong because a single stick lasts me close to a year, yet I use it twice daily. Guess I&#x27;m set for the next few decade.</li>
    <li> The Degree deodorant I purchased was great!  The speed at which I received the item was very good.  The prouct itself was wrapped good and it was just like I had went to the store to purchase it myself.  overall, I think the service was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it continues to work for me.  Great price with subscribe and save.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Product description specifically says it includes three twin packs for six total but they ship one twin pack and a single.&lt;br /&gt;Somebody screwed up big time!</li>
    <li> Big fan of the deodorant.  I am a very athletic person and I find that some other brands simply do not &amp;#34;protect&amp;#34; as long as Degree seems to.  I can&#x27;t stand it when you are half way through a basketball game or fighting to get up a difficult hill on a mountain bike and you are catch a sniff of yourself and you just flat out stink.  Degree has always made me feel confident when it comes to these types of things.  I would have normally rated these a 5 star but I have found recently that some of their dispensers seem to be broken.  I have 3 brand new devices and the wheel at the bottom is broken so there is no way to get the deodorant to advance and come out.  Pretty disappointing!  Other than that I am a big fan.</li>
    <li> best cheap deodorant in the world</li>
    <li> I bought Degree using subscribe and save.  I use this every day, go figure.  It&#x27;s the brand and scent I like and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Degree gives me the best sweat / smell protection that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most other brands I tried do not work as well.</li>
    <li> What a HUGE LIE this product is. It says invisible, but it is anything but invisible. It leaves white stains on all of my shirts. I definitely advise avoiding this product at all cost, even if there was not any other single deodorants in the world. Had I known it&#x27;s not invisible, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted $20 on these 6 deodorants.</li>
    <li> I sweat, a lot.  Pretty obvious why I need deodorant, but I&#x27;ve learned the hard way that not all are created equally and I am now exclusively committed to Degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, no Antiperspirant is going to stop me from sweating, just not going to happen.  But there&#x27;s a marked difference in terms of preventing odor between a good and poor brand, and this one prevents me from smelling like the gym hours after I&#x27;ve showered.  I&#x27;d say it gives me a good 10-12 hours, in my book that&#x27;s as much as I can ask from any deodorant.  I&#x27;m sticking with Degree (no pun intended) until it stops working or I stop smelling...wonder which will happen first!</li>
    <li> I had placed an order and was expecting 3 - twin packs. 6 sticks total. I only received  3 sticks. I have seen some reviews with the same problem and was hoping they fixed it. I am giving this 4 stars because Degree is my favorite deodorant and Amazon customer service is top notch. I was able to return them for free and was quickly credited.</li>
    <li> Got it cheap but Smell is not great and barely lasts an hour. You get what you pay for I guess</li>
    <li> As like everyone else, I thought I was buying twin three packs and was disappointed when I only got three sticks of deodorant. The deodorant itself is fine. I&#x27;ve been using degree for a long time now and it works well. One star for false advertising.</li>
    <li> The product features and the product description clearly state that this is supposed to include 6 sticks of deodorant.  What I received was 3.  When you read the title, one logically and reasonably would conclude that the \\&quot; twin pack, (pack of 3)\\&quot; means 3 packs of 2 sticks (twin packs), however, that is not what I received. Buyer beware -- not as great of a deal as it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, Amazon fixed my order and set me the other 3  sticks! Satisfied. Only complaint is that it wasn&#x27;t right the first time.</li>
    <li> Best Deodorant out there. Stays on ALL DAY. Has a GREAT scent.</li>
    <li> I hate to leave bad feedback for a product when it&#x27;s really about the deceptive sale practices. I just didn&#x27;t know another way to warn others not to buy from this page. The picture and words clearly show &amp;#34;twin pack&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;pack of 3.&amp;#34; This would obviously mean 6 deodorants. As with other buyers, what I received was 3 deodorants, 2.7 oz each. They do not have &amp;#34;Twin Pack&amp;#34; displayed on the front, so the product as pictured is different from the product I received. I returned my items for a refund which I received.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deoderant for the past 10 years, and I&#x27;m deployed in Afghanistan where they don&#x27;t sell this, so I bought some here. Smells good, keeps you from sweating excessively, so I&#x27;d say it does the job well.</li>
    <li> In store, 6 of these would cost about $24, but online they are around $10 cheaper for 6!</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest way to order this stuff. You know you are going to use it, so buy it in bulk and save.</li>
    <li> My order came as advertised, 3 sets of twin packs. I read in the reviews that some did not get the same deal</li>
    <li> Got it for my boyfriend oh..and brother. 6 came inside. The smell is not strong. My boyfriend wanted an ever lasting scent and something that was gonna last longer. 5 hours tops i say it last. Maybe im wrong. But it was all 9.99 for 6. Cant beat that baby!</li>
    <li> I like the product, but Amazon makes it look like youi are getting a twin pack of 3 (6 total).  Imagine my surprise when there are just 3 for an outrageous price...</li>
    <li> Not only does it work great, but it has a really nice scent too.  And...it&#x27;s cheap!  5 stars all the way!</li>
    <li> This is NOT for 6 deodorants. it is for a total of 3 which makes the pricing way too high for this item. VERY POOR JOB ON AMAZONS PART HERE AS USUAL!</li>
    <li> The description made it seem like there would be three packs of two but I only got three sticks. This appears to be a common problem. I hope Amazon&#x27;s &#x27;review&#x27; gets all of us our full order eventually.</li>
    <li> Its deodorant and it does its job. Sometimes it gets a little clumpy or powdery, but overall good product that does as advertised.</li>
    <li> Advertised and priced as 3 twin packs (6 total) but only received 1 twin pack and 1 individual (3 total).</li>
    <li> Made my stinky son smell better.</li>
    <li> Amazon fullfillment says this is a two pack, pack of three. I thought that meant three two packs, or six sticks of Antiperspirant. That would have been a good deal at $12, since where I live this product sells for about $4 a stick and sometimes is on sale Buy one get one free, or about $2 a stick, which I thought was the price. Only three total arrived, which makes this $4 a stick, not a deal but a regular price.</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
    <li> This is not 6 individual units, as any ample-minded person might deduce. They literally took a 2pk and 1/2 of a 2pk, threw them in a box and called it &#x27;Pack of 3&#x27;. I would rate zero if possible</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the other purchasers, but I bought this on 02/18/2013, and I received all 6, 3-2 packs. Just as described in the description.</li>
    <li> The description makes it seem like you will be receiving 3 Twin Packs, but you will receive one Twin Pack and one single stick.</li>
    <li> That being said.  its a great deal on my favorite deoderant.  Better than my local store prices. No more words.</li>
    <li> Product works as expected.  I have used this product before so I re-ordered the item. ........... ....... ....... ...... ......</li>
    <li> I used to stink. Now I don&#x27;t. thanks Degree for making a great product. Now the ladies come from all around to smell my fresh pits.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different deodorants but this has to be the worst I have ever used. Whether you put on a little or a lot, it does not last very long. What I hate the most though, it falls apart very easily so if you are wearing a short sleved shirt, you will get deodorant crumbs everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Gillette Mach 3 deodorant. It comes in Clean and Fresh scents. I prefer the dry type over the gel and this deodorant lasts a long time, it does not fall apart, and the scent is nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> Degree is a tried and true champion of the deodorant world.  While deodorant may not be a big deal to YOU, it&#x27;s a big deal to everyone else when you stink like a skunk that just walked out of a swamp.  gets you some Degree toot sweet!</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting 6 sticks, but only received 3.  This would have been a fair price for 6 sticks but for 3 sticks I could have bought it at any store for less.  Maybe it was an incorrect shipment but I am not sure how to notify Amazon of an incorrect shipment amount (I can only find a return option which isn&#x27;t worth the time).</li>
    <li> I love these 2-packs. Why it took deodorant makers 30 years to invent a twin pack is beyond me. I have two arms, therefore two armpits. It&#x27;s simple math. I have been walking around for years with only one dry pit. Then I discovered this twin pack, and boom! DOUBLE DRY!! What a life saver! Now I get all the ladies. What&#x27;s especially great about this triple-double pack is that it is perfect for my brothers too! I am the middle triplet, and I bought this triple-double pack so my two brothers Huey and Dewey (no joke) can also now share in my dryness. The Killroy brothers give this product 6 thumbs up!!!!!!</li>
    <li> WOW They jacked up the price now.  Got if for a great deal a while back as six in a pack for about $2.50 each. WAY more now.</li>
    <li> This has been around for a while. It is a always good to stock up on things that you use daily and for this price you cant go wrong. It works well as a dry stick deodorant and antiperspirant. This is for the men that cut trees all day and do mans work, all-though im sure it works well for the computer tech also.</li>
    <li> this was a good value and I am happy with the product.  I am a female and I still use this product.  It has a pleasant smell.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> Degree is one of the more economical deodorants yet works better than some of its more expensive counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-not sticky&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t stain clothes&lt;br /&gt;-keeps you dry&lt;br /&gt;-nice scent but not intrusive&lt;br /&gt;-YOU DON&#x27;T STINK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously a good deal, does the job and you&#x27;ll be satisfied and a happy user for years as am I.</li>
    <li> The product is fine. I&#x27;ve used it for a while now, and it works. What isn&#x27;t okay is the deceptive title. It is NOT a pack of three twin packs. It is merely three sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inclusion of the word \\&quot;twin pack\\&quot; is illogical and deliberately deceptive. Three isn&#x27;t divisible by two, so there&#x27;s no reason to assume that you&#x27;d only be getting three sticks if the package was made up of twin packs. But it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s made up of one twin pack and one extra stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this particular listing though. You can probably find it for $3 a stick or less at your local drugstore or big box retailer. Amazon should take action to correct the title of this product and remove all references to twin pack.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant. Buying in the twin pack is a great deal. I selected subscribe and save - perfect way to remain stress free about running out of toiletries... and it&#x27;s cheaper than in stores.</li>
    <li> I thought it worked great. Before using this product I stank bad, now not so much. You must reapply every 24 hours or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for a few years now. It&#x27;s anti-perspirant properties are pretty good, usually keeps me dry. I wish the scent wasn&#x27;t so strong or unscented, that would be nice.</li>
    <li> I needed deodorant and found this. I always use this brand and it works great for me.  I received three 2-packs for less than $12 and it saved me a trip to the store.</li>
    <li> Great price thru Amazon for this deodorant.  Love this stuff but both of the ones I received were defective and I wasn&#x27;t able to push the deodorant up inside the holder.  With a complaint sent to Degree they sent me a coupon for a free one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Degree. If this is your deodorant of choice of course you&#x27;ll like this. Keeps my man smelling clean and not stinky. Nice smelling</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deal if you like this deodorant, but I prefer Old Spice personally. Don&#x27;t you hate that these reviews require a set number of words?</li>
    <li> My wife and I belong to BJs wholesale club and even they can&#x27;t beat the price of this deodorant on Amazon.  The scent is good (I still smell like the deodorant after an hour workout) and it lasts much longer than an gel type deodorant.</li>
    <li> This Degree does not smell as good as the Adrenaline Series. The smell is somewhat subdued and usually my spouse can tell if I just used my deodorant (I apply mine very lightly- 2 swipes usually)  I received 6 sticks total from my order at Amazon. If you want something with more fragrance go with another Degree product or brand but if you want something that keeps your pits dry for a cheap price, this is for you. Stay dry my fellow gentlemen.</li>
    <li> I sweat A LOT.  I&#x27;ve tried every brand out there and these are the only ones that I can stay dry using.  Very good product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was almost ready to return to Amazon,  Until I found out how to move the deodorant up and out of the case to use.  I like the smell and it really works on antiperspirant no wet under arm I would recommend this to anyone.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> Good product will always use it and get it from this website.. product keeps me fresh and feeling good at all time</li>
    <li> I guess I got lucky as I got 6 deodorants unlike three a lot of people are complaining about. At that price it is a very good buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and expected to receive 6 total, 3 twins packs.  Well I received a twin pack and a single one, 3 total.</li>
    <li> Degree is the first deodorant/anti perspirant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor and sweat protection. Put it on once in the morning and it lasts all day. I now use this brand and nothing else. An average price for a 3 pack is usually around the 10 bucks range and if you  see anything higher then you are paying too much.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t that why we purchase underarm deordarant to stay dry and not to stink.  I&#x27;ve Been a fan of Degree for years.  Found it on Amazon at a remarkable price and with Prime.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant.  It works keeping me from sweating through my dress shirts at work and it smells great.  And so many for such a low price.</li>
    <li> Great way to be sure never to run out.  I never have to think out making sure it is on the list. Great time saver all around.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deoderant, and frankly, mine too. First I loved it because of how he smelled, and one day I ran out of mine and started using his - it worked better than what I&#x27;d been using and still smelled great without being too &#x27;manly&#x27; for a woman. (Though it is certainly a manly enough scent for hubby, and I love it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought the pack of 3 - two sticks per, and it&#x27;s the same as if I&#x27;d gotten it at the store, except I caught it on sale and saved a BUNDLE. My wallet&#x27;s really loving this!</li>
    <li> Degree always is a great product and the price is very reasonable, considering what the grocery stores charge. Shipped quickly, very happy with my order.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 sets of these for hubby and I....(so what if I smell manly?).....It gets the job done and does not rub white onto clothes...The bonus pack makes it all.....twice as fun.....would recommend....</li>
    <li> Item is as description says, does what it is supposed to.  Lasts all day, even through hard workout.  Decent fresh scent, not overpowering or nauseating. Good price, shipping was on time.  Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price, would be nice if it returned to the subscribe &amp; save store though !</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Twin Pack\\&quot;--Indicates 3 per order (or 6 sticks) for over $11.00  -- pretty good Deal.  Instead I received on 3 individual  sticks of deodorant.  Not only misleading--it is a bad buy.  I did call Amazon and they immediately resolved the issue by resending the correct product AND UPS label for return of wrong product AND UPS pick Tag.  It may have been a misleading product or a mistake but nonetheless Amazon stood by me their customer and made it right.  I love AMAZON!</li>
    <li> This item was listed as 3 twin packs (6 total sticks) but arrived as 3 single sticks of deodorant. Either deceptive description or just straight up  false advertising.</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry and the scent is awesome for men. The scent is just the right balance for being deodorant as opposed to smelling too much like cologne or the overpowering smell some deodorants have. Also a great deal getting this regularly on Amazon instead of a local store.</li>
    <li> Good price, always need deodorant.  Tired of paying $4 each so the bulk option is worth it in the long run.</li>
    <li> Bought the deodorant through Amazon so I wouldn&#x27;t have to drive to Costco. Ordered on 2/25/13 and received it 3/2/13. Got all 6 sticks of deodorant --- all three twin packs were sealed in a plastic bag. Based on other reviews, it seems it is random whether you&#x27;re gonna get all the six as described or the faulty three. Product itself is good, though not always necessarily invisible -- perhaps it&#x27;s because the boyfriend likes to cake it on himself! He&#x27;s not too picky with his deodorant, and the smell is alright.</li>
    <li> The order should have been 3 doublepack a total of 6 .Ionly got 1 double pack and 1 single .I only got 3 instead of 6 .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened with the customers who only received a few deodorants. I received all Six, Three packs of Two. This was a great deal, and I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase! Degree is the only deodorant I use, it&#x27;s mild yet powerful. With the $1 off coupon Amazon was offering, this deal can&#x27;t be beat! I bought the same size deodorant from Sam&#x27;s Club for about $8 for a four pack.</li>
    <li> I received my deoderants really quick! wow what a great deal. a pack of 6 deoderants for 11 bucks. I was paying 4 bucks a piece locally! screw that not anymore!</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND GOT A SAMPLE OF THIS DEGREE DFODERANT/ANTIPERSPERANT &amp; REALLY LIKED IT BUT I NEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT 4 HIM IF IT WASNT 4 AMAZON. OUR LOCAL LARGE DRUGSTORE CHAIN CHARGES THE SAME PRICE FOR ONLY 2 STICKS AS OPPOSED TO THE 6 STICKS I GOT HERE. ..THEY ARRIVED QUICKLY IN PRISTINE CONDITION, MY HUBBY SMELLS GREAT &amp; U CANT BEAT THE PRICE. I WILL BUY AGAIN + HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this same package before. In the previous purchase I received 3 twin packs of the Degree Deodorant but on this new purhcase (2/22/2013). It only came with 1 twin pack and 1 loose. I&#x27;m was very disappointed. I will be sending this back and will no longer purchase this product from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> The description says \\&quot;Case of three packages, each containing two 2.7-ounce deodorant sticks (total of 6 sticks)\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t receive that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only received one pack of a single stick wrapped with a twin set of sticks, totaling three sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description of the product is unreliable and so is the title...\\&quot;Twin Pack,(Pack of 3)\\&quot;...or 2*3 &#x3D; 6 sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this product 5 stars but because I only received half of the expected product I&#x27;m only giving it a 2.5 (and I&#x27;m not rounding up)</li>
