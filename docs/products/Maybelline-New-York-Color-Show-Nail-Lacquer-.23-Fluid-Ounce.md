      <li>Rose:</li>
      <li>i liked this</li>
      <li>It is kind of matte yet still metallic.</li>
      <li>This color is a semi-sheer smoky rose with beige flop.</li>
      <li>Goes on very easily.</li>
      <li>I also use Konad brand and this gold is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>A beautiful shade and the polish holds up very well against chips and wear.</li>
      <li>This one I would call more a  chrome finish.</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>When I used it, I found what I had purchased was a holographic polish that is more than just a gold color.  </li>
      <li>I  would however add a top coat though.</li>
      <li>better pay 3 $ more for OPI</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for stamping with, which is why I ordered three bottles after not being able to find it in my local stores anymore.</li>
      <li>It is also more matte than shiny which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
      <li>Wish this was still available at drugstores!</li>
      <li>I found that it chipped easily too.</li>
      <li>like another reviewer mentioned it chips relatively easily without coverage.</li>
      <li>They apply smoothly and evenly.</li>
      <li>Nice metallic gold that is not dull at all but also not too shiny.</li>
      <li>so you need two coats to get full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold</li>
      <li>It took three coats before the color really showed a lovely gold.  </li>
      <li>True gold.</li>
      <li>but I do love that this is a very metallic gold.</li>
      <li>it does chip pretty easily.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get where the \\&quot;holographic\\&quot; part comes in, but this polish has a bold metallic finish which is immediately eye-catching.</li>
      <li>the gold is a very pretty color.</li>
      <li>, doesnt last too much time but for the price i think is good</li>
      <li>Again this is kind of sheer and watery</li>
      <li>You better hope there are some bottles left because I am going to buy them all.  </li>
      <li>really pretty.</li>
      <li>The name of this polish is pretty misleading.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m back to buy a couple more bottles.</li>
      <li>It is much more solid and opaque.</li>
      <li>I bought these to use for myself as well as for my actors and models with my production company, I loved the Green</li>
      <li>Very neutral and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It applies evenly and dries to be very metallic and glossy.</li>
      <li>They dry pretty quickly, and they remove easily with regular strength nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>I purchased this mainly for stamping, but used it as a nail colour for a party.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it chips relatively easily without a top coat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a fun gold nail polish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very rich and long lasting</li>
      <li>This polish is the exact shade of gold I was looking for (not too yellow).</li>
      <li>This is such a pretty polish and I get loads of compliments every time I wear it.</li>
      <li>One coat gives you complete coverage.</li>
      <li>Classy color.</li>
      <li>This polish is very thick, and so kind of difficult to paint on nicely.</li>
      <li>You do need at least two coats to get full coverage.</li>

    <li> This is a gorgeous gold color. I am very happy with the formula, thickness and color.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Love!</li>
    <li> The name of this polish is pretty misleading. It&#x27;s not at all what I would consider holographic (which is what color club nailed with their halo hues collections) but I do love that this is a very metallic gold. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect for stamping with, which is why I ordered three bottles after not being able to find it in my local stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Love the color. It&#x27;s very rich and long lasting</li>
    <li> This polish is the exact shade of gold I was looking for (not too yellow). It applies evenly and dries to be very metallic and glossy. My only complaint is that it chips relatively easily without a top coat.</li>
    <li> Goes on very easily. Nice metallic gold that is not dull at all but also not too shiny. Classy color.</li>
    <li> Love this color, and it sticks great. I have a hand heavy job and the polish lasted over a week without chipping.</li>
    <li> This is such a pretty polish and I get loads of compliments every time I wear it. I like that it&#x27;s actually metallic/gold leaf looking and not just shimmery or glittery</li>
    <li> the gold is a very pretty color. I  would however add a top coat though. it does chip pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Others have complained about how matte and thick it is.  This is perfect for nail stamping.  I bought this based on a recommendation from a nail blog that it is the best color for gold stamping polish.  I&#x27;ve tried several different gold polishes and they are all too shimmery.  Konad doesn&#x27;t do gold and silver metallic colors too well, but this is perfect for stamping.  I&#x27;m back to buy a couple more bottles. Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had heard it is an excellent polish for nail stamping. It is! Wish this was still available at drugstores!</li>
    <li> I purchased this simply to add gold to my collection of nail polishes.  When I used it, I found what I had purchased was a holographic polish that is more than just a gold color.  I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! Not shiny or glittery, which is what I wanted. This is an &amp;#34;adult&amp;#34; shade of gold. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> beautiful color... but not so hollo</li>
    <li> This polish is very thick, and so kind of difficult to paint on nicely. It is also more matte than shiny which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a fun gold nail polish. It doesn&#x27;t have a mirror finish - but really pretty. It does wear off fast though - thin consistency.</li>
    <li> It does not last even 2 days,the quality of the product is poor,would not recommend..better pay 3 $ more for OPI</li>
    <li> Bold Gold is PERFECT for nail stamping!  You will NOT be disappointed. I also use Konad brand and this gold is by far the best.  You better hope there are some bottles left because I am going to buy them all.  lol</li>
    <li> It took three coats before the color really showed a lovely gold.  I was pretty disappointed in it overall, I found it dull.</li>
    <li> Great color! True gold.</li>
    <li> A beautiful shade and the polish holds up very well against chips and wear. I wore it for Thanksgiving.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the color as it was much closer to bronze than gold. I found that it chipped easily too.</li>
    <li> i liked this and i use it for party outfits, doesnt last too much time but for the price i think is good</li>
    <li> It WAS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IN A GOLD COLOR...LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get where the \\&quot;holographic\\&quot; part comes in, but this polish has a bold metallic finish which is immediately eye-catching. I purchased this mainly for stamping, but used it as a nail colour for a party. I was running late and did not apply a topcoat... like another reviewer mentioned it chips relatively easily without coverage. I had not noticed that before then because when I stamped I always used a topcoat and never had a problem. also, when used for stamping, the polish is very difficult to remove from the plate unless 100% acetone-soaked cotton is laid on it for at least a minute.</li>
    <li> I have these polishes in a few different colors. I like all of them. They apply smoothly and evenly. They dry pretty quickly, and they remove easily with regular strength nail polish remover. I will describe each of the colors I have individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alluring Rose: This color is a semi-sheer smoky rose with beige flop. You do need at least two coats to get full coverage. Very neutral and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mystic Green:  Metallic sage green with a gold flop. Again this is kind of sheer and watery so you need two coats to get full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold Gold: on the bottle this one actually says Metallic, not Holographic. The texture is different. It is much more solid and opaque. One coat gives you complete coverage. This one I would call more a  chrome finish. It is kind of matte yet still metallic. It is a dull burnished gold color. It reminds me of Sally Hansen nail makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like these polishes.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for myself as well as for my actors and models with my production company, I loved the Green With Envy (320) sea foam color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLUS SIDES&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth&lt;br /&gt;-Bold Color&lt;br /&gt;-Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;-Strong&lt;br /&gt;-Price: Compared to Sally Hansen, amazing price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOWN SIDES&lt;br /&gt;-Too thick of a brush, you need something smaller to do any styling</li>
