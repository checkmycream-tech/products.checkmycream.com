<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My 11 year old desperately wanted this collection.  She is not only a HUGE fan of the Hunger Games, but also of funky nail polish colors.  I&#x27;m not one to spend this kind of money on nail polish for her, but this was a well placed investment!  The colors are rich and people have given us great tips on how to best use China Glaze colors (ie, a lot of the shades are metallic, so there is a particular way to apply them which she and I didn&#x27;t know before).  The colors are rich and truly represent each of their districts with pride!  Though there is no guide as to which color is which district, it is not hard to figure out most of them.  My daughter has already applied Fast Track (District 6) and Mahogany Magic (District 7), and you can&#x27;t ask for easier application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will definitely buy more China Glaze products, especially if they still have this line around in the uture, though I&#x27;m hoping she doesn&#x27;t use them up quickly!</li>
    <li> THG nail polish collection is beautiful! Most nail polish looks similar to one that you might have. Not these! I have never seen these colors anywhere else. At first I was leery about buying the whole set. Normally I think that most glitter nail polish looks like it has confetti in it. However, I just got the whole lot of them because it worked out to be a better deal. One flat rate for the product and one shipping cost. I love every single color in the collection. You can&#x27;t go wrong!!!</li>
    <li> i love the colors- they dry fairly quick and the colors coordinate well. the only color i don&#x27;t like is the clear with glitter- the flakes come off to easily and causes chipping, but it is an easy fix with a clear topcoat.</li>
    <li> I would never purchase brown or grey nail polish and I didn&#x27;t even know what mate was before I bought this set.  It&#x27;s a beautiful set and great for any Hunger Games fan.</li>
    <li> My experience was a bit rocky at first. I actually ordered these because I fell in love with Fast Track. When I got something in the mail it was only 3 bottles of polish with a note that says I got refunded for Fast Track as it was out of stock. Heart broken I quickly got over it because the rest of the collection is amazing. They look great in the bottles and when you put them on your nails they that much better. And they apply very nicely There was a bit of trouble with emails but in the end I was able to talk to someone about not getting the rest of the bottles. She was really nice and very apologetic. I got the bottles shortly after She said they sent. Even though this wasn&#x27;t an idea experience with shipping I would definitely order from them again. So nice and understanding.</li>
    <li> This product was awesome! The colors are not cheesy and they look like what the adds show. Sometimes with essie the colors is a little darker on the nail but this stuff is spot on.</li>
    <li> I love these nail polishes!  They are mostly dark, muted, wintery/fall colors which match the tone of the books perfectly.  There are a few (Riveting, Luxe &amp; Lush) that are bright and brilliant.  Overall, they go on well, don&#x27;t chip, and are perfect for any Hunger Games fan.  Very impressed.</li>
    <li> I am very mad, I only received 10 bottles instead of 12, I will write a better review if I get ALL the bottles I  PAID FOR! I also recieved my nail polish 3 days later than the LATEST time they said they would send it!!!! They still have not gotten back to me about the product!!!!!!!!!! THIS WAS AWFUL !</li>
    <li> Every single one of these colors is absolutely gorgeous!! I have ordered a ton of China Glaze Collections and this is by far my favorite. I have never even seen the hunger games movies nor read the books...I just saw this collection and immediately fell in love with the colors in the pictures. This seller doesn&#x27;t have the best picture....but I did find a different seller on here who had images you could make really big so I took a look at that sellers images, but went with this seller because it was a much better price for 12 bottles. I was so happy I got all 12 colors. In the past I&#x27;ve ordered collections that unfortunately fell short of 12 bottles because they were out of stock on that particular color! Nothing about this was disappointing. I am so happy. By far my favorite collection thus far!! Sooooooo HAPPY! Would highly highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great collection with a variety of colors, there are even two top coats which are versatile and go with almost anything.</li>
    <li> They have the names on the bottom and the colors are so different from what you can find in regular nail polish! My favorite is District 5, Electrify! Its sparkles and they best thing is, a layer of District 2 Stone cold with a thin layer of District 5 and it looks fantastic!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance, she said she wanted one of the colors, but the whole collection was a much better value.  She thanked me and uses them everyday, so I assume it is good.</li>
    <li> This product has a very different and wide variety of colors that I was extremely excited to add to my collection.  The colors are unique and after buying them I did not regret it one bit.  Te colors were every bit as exciting as I thought they would be.  The shipping time was quick and I was overall very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only recently that I started pampering my nails with at-home treatments and polish. I&#x27;ve tried most drug store brands, from cheap $2 brands that chip a day after to the more expensive brands that cost as much $10 per bottle. I happened across a fashion blog post that was all about China Glaze.  I had never even heard of it but I loved the bold, dramatic colors of the Capitol Collection.  I immediately searched for them on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t believe how cheap they are.  I was skeptical.  I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome this brand is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied two coats on my fingernails and finished them off with an off-brand top coat.  It has been close to a week and they still look as if I had painted them only a day ago.  I hand wash my dishes in fairly hot, soapy water at least twice a day (and I don&#x27;t wear gloves).  I also work with my hands a lot doing arts and crafts, using tools that sometimes find their way banging on to my nails.  But my sparkly nails still look fab!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with how quickly the polish dries.  I am a bit impatient when it comes to any type of beauty regimen so I often bought the fast-dry brands.  The problem with many of those was that it was next to impossible to get a smooth finish.  With the China Glaze, it goes on evenly without it clumping or creating unsightly dry lines in the middle of the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend China Glaze.  In fact, I don&#x27;t plan on ever buying another brand.  I am hooked!</li>
    <li> I received 11 instead of 12 but the seller refunded me for a bottle right before it&#x27;s shipped so I am okay with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will just go buy the missing one from my local store. It&#x27;s going to cost a bit more but for a full collection it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, Beautiful colors! I started swatching on my wheel and every time I add a color, the more I feel in love with them! One of my best buy here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love them! The colors are so different from what I&#x27;ve seen in stores. My favorite is Dress Me Up. I had already bought it from Hot Topic but now I have an extra bottle!</li>
    <li> China Glaze has really moved its way into salons that do manicures and pedicures.  It is a rival to O.P.I. and works just as good.  They have a LOT of interesting colors from bland to bright.  I love the cover, the shine and the wear......D</li>
    <li> This collection doesn&#x27;t have a single color that I don&#x27;t like. I think hook and line is my least favorite and foie gras is the best!</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter and she loves it. Now she&#x27;s convinced all her friends to get it as well.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m unable to actually review the polish since I had to throw the entire thing in the garbage.. And while I&#x27;m completely aware, especially when coming from overseas, the issues that can occur with shipping - it was so poorly packaged, it&#x27;s no wonder all of the polish was smashed and went right in the trash. Please beware of the very poor packaging, this is a $50 gamble.. 12 nail polishes wrapped together in flimsy boxes in plastic wrap. No filler or bubble wrap. So disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, Amazon is AMAZING with their customer service and issued me a refund immediately, no questions asked. Since it was nail polish, it was not able to be sent back.. So had there been some salvageable, I would have gotten those for free. They even offered to pay one day shipping costs if I ordered again.</li>
    <li> I ordered full set of this collection, all of them are such wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;All of them are neutral which I like except the orange color.&lt;br /&gt;Everything has shine finish except the stone cold which is matt finish.&lt;br /&gt;All dries super fast and I&#x27;ll enjoy them for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;My favorate is the dress me up which is the muted mauve pink color.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little upset to find out the mahogani magic was broken during shippment, but I hope the seller will send me the replacement soon.&lt;br /&gt;I have more than 200 nail polishes and china glaze is my number one regular nail polish brand.&lt;br /&gt;They are chip resistent, harmful chemical free and shiny even without top coat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this set. China Glaze is a great brand, and these polishes are no exception. Each polish is quite unusual, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed in any of the 12 colors. Stone Cold is probably my favorite, with a peculiar matte, stony grey finish. Riveting and Smoke &amp; Ashes are also quite unique. The glitter/foil polishes layer nicely. These all wear very well; note that I use a base coat and top coat with 1 to 2 coats of the polish. Typically, these will last a week with that system...even longer with touch-ups. No chipping at all so far. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love these colors!! And I was very happy with the China Glaze product. I never understood that differences between good finger nail polish and great finger nail polish! i am really impressed with this!!</li>
    <li> I really like these colors they are true to the colors you see in the picture and I really like how one coat is all you need.</li>
    <li> I received this so fast and nothing was broken as mentioned in other posts.  There was so much wrapping it took about 10 minutes to get into it.  Which I appreciate!  I already knew I liked the colors but they really are amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this, not only because I am a big hunger games fan, but also because I was in the market for some more \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; tones to add to my growing nail polish collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard about China Glaze from a girlfriend, who mentioned they were pretty good because it was long lasting and shiny, even without a top coat (this of course only counts for normal polishes, not the matte ones..) I must admit, the matte colour is this range is seriously not my thing, but I guess that&#x27;s something I&#x27;m going to either get used to, or not...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I jumped in when I saw this offer. All the bottles came well packed against breakages (all intact!) and the colours were astonishing. LOVE the vibrant orange glitter and the brownish/neutral tones. Colour goes on smooth, 2 coats and you&#x27;re good to go. Dries well and doesn&#x27;t muck up and lasts at least 5 working days. (Yes, I was dishes by hand, play volleyball, work with my hands and what not.. &#x3D;D In short, I am not kind to nail polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great colour pay-off, good lasting properties.</li>
    <li> All are wear-to-work appropriate  and look great.  You do need to use 2 coats to really make these look good.</li>
    <li> I love painting my nails but have found many polishes just dont stand up to a lot of work that requires you to use your hands.. (military). I&#x27;ve seen CG polishes in the past and figured they were just the same as the polishes in the drug stores. Man was i wrong! THese polishes last a really long time! Im no longer in the military but still have a job where im working with my hands, and the polish still lasts the whole week or longer vs another brand that will only last a day or two! amazing! I recommend to anyone CG polishes! They are a little more then the drug store brand but the extra money is worth it for the quality you get in these polishes!</li>
    <li> MY girl friend absolutely loved these nail polishes. She has always been a big fan of the books and movies, and she said that the names and colors of the different nail polishes portrayed the series very well. I hope these will stay around for a while I have a feeling i might be buying another set for her. :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much I love this collection. I love each and every one of the colors, but I have to admit that I keep going back to Dress Me Up! It just never wears on me. :) Each and every color in this collection is unique; I have never seen any other colors quite like these. Stone Cold dries matte, so if you&#x27;re not a fan of that, just slap a shiny topcoat on it. I love it both ways. I even throw a matte topcoat on some of the others just to play around and see how they look. Beautifully pigmented, long-lasting, gorgeous polishes; didn&#x27;t expect anything less from China Glaze. Love, love, love this collection.</li>
    <li> She loved the colour range and was right into the hunger games.  Also.. at the price we pay in Australia for nailpolish.. how can you beat buying from OS?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love China Glaze polishes and this collection is all around awesome. You don&#x27;t have to be a fan of the Hunger Games to enjoy all the beautiful and neutral colors this collection has to offer. China Glaze polish is a quality yet nicely priced polish. The consistency and opacity is on par with other higher end polishes; you only need two coats on most of these (3 to make the sheers opaque if you want to). It lasts a decent amount of time if you use base and top coat but that is pretty much true with most polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy them all but my favorites have to be Argo (metallic olive green), Harvest Moon (metallic copper), and Riveting (orange red w/ shimmer).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these nail polishes- each based on a Hunger Games district.  They dry fast, and look amazing.  At least for  a little, then they chip like crazy!  After 3 days  with no, or little help all of the polish chipped off on it&#x27;s own.  Some chip more than others, but all are really chippy.  I figure it&#x27;s just another excuse to try a new polish of the 12 each time one chips off, no harmful polish remover needed.  I&#x27;m glad I got them, and I think they are beautiful, but because of the fact the paint won&#x27;t stay on nails, I have to give them a 2.</li>
    <li> so i have had these a while now and i have worn most of the colors an i gotta say... i love them!!! the creams come off in seconds with nail polish remover and the grey matte drys so quickly!!!</li>
    <li> my boyfriend&#x27;s daughter wanted this badly. It came in a very cheap packaging for such an expensive product but I am glad it was available.</li>
    <li> most colors in this set are really great and look like the pictures.  the only two I wouldn&#x27;t use are &amp;#34;Mahogany magic&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fast track&amp;#34;.  &amp;#34;fast track&amp;#34; is more of a cream color with gold flecks in it and is doesn&#x27;t look look nearly as good as it does in the picture.  &amp;#34;mahogany magic&amp;#34; is just really poop brown colored and I can&#x27;t see myself wearing it.  all the other colors are very pretty and look true to the picture when dry.  My two favorites are &amp;#34;dress me up&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;frois gras&amp;#34; because they could go with any look. I would recommend this set to others except the two mentioned above.</li>
    <li> Great colors. Long lasting. Superb quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative point to this is that it&#x27;s really thick, but again, I&#x27;m a newbie when it comes to putting on nail polish.</li>
    <li> the colors are absoloutly gorgeous. they represent the 12 districts of panem fabulously, but they chip like crazy. and that is kind of strange for china glaze...i painted my nails before i went to bed, and by the afternoon of the next deay, the would be really badly chipped</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, fast shipping. I love OPI polish, decent middle grade polish. I love these colors, range from vibrant to earthy, lots of neautal tones.</li>
    <li> Love all of the colours of this collection. All seem to be easy to apply as well which is great. So good I might just have to order again.</li>
    <li> I got these for my girlfriend and she didn&#x27;t know where to start, she liked them all so much. I&#x27;m pretty interested in them myself and really enjoyed the Hunger Games stories along with all the colors that come with the nail polish collection. They are fun to talk about and a month later she still can&#x27;t decide which one to choose for her nails. Wonderful set and a good value on here compared to buying individual bottles or buying the set on an online store.</li>
    <li> They came during the expected time range, and look way better than the online photos. Each of them has a little surprise waiting when I apply onto my nails, so don&#x27;t judge a book by its cover ;) Some of them make good combinations with each other, so with as little as $3 each bottle, I have at least 20 ways to decorate my nails. Score!!!</li>
    <li> I love all of these colors and I am not a Hunger Games fan. My Granddaughter is and a fan and I used one of the colors from her collection and loved it.  So I purchased a set.  Buying the set is so much cheaper than buying 1 bottle at a time.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever spent more than $3 on a single bottle of nail polish. I actually got the whole set.&lt;br /&gt;And I lovelovelovelove them.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are sophisticated versions of the colors I grew up wearing. They have incredible staying power on your nails, even without a base coat or a top coat. My favorites are the green, the dark blue, the orange, the copper, and the matte-finish dark silver. The pinkish one is actually closer to a nude shade on me, which is useful for when I have match something for a special occasion. The opalescent top coat turns any plain color into something special. The only one I really don&#x27;t like is the straight up red and gold glitter, but even that has it&#x27;s time of use.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about buying these, do it. Totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;*edit t+2 years*&lt;br /&gt;I used the red and gold glitter for a school project and also to help identify keys. Glitter polish stays forever.</li>
    <li> Great quality and colors!</li>
    <li> Good price, great polishes. There are some that I find a little more blah, but then I&#x27;ve done friends nails and those are their favorite colors. So, a good selection.</li>
    <li> Great nail polish, stays on without chipping even on natural fingernails, even in pool, at beach, and with frequent hand washing.</li>
    <li> A1 thx a lot, really like my new nail polish!! i&#x27;m so in love!!! thx again! Can have new nail each day yeah! :D</li>
    <li> It is great for the price. China Glaze is not the cheapest and it is Hunger Games. However, I actually do not like about half of the colors, so if you want them all to have them all, get it, but if there are just a few that you know you like, just buy the few.</li>
    <li> Great product wearing one of the colors right now and amazing collection lots of glitters and pretty neutrals love it</li>
    <li> Awesome colors for an awesome price.  Love them. I think the Argo is my favorite.  Reminds me of Rue too :)</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not all my top list, but I like the fact this set gives you a big range from glitter to a more demure color.  Standard China Glaze formula, no complaints on the brushes, and the cap is big enough not to cause gripping problems for me.</li>
    <li> Great collection for anyone, you don&#x27;t have to be a Hunger Games lover to enjoy it, but that will certainly make it more exciting! Its mostly very basic and neutral colors that go with anything, I would say mostly fall colors but they can be worn year around! As a nail polish guru I give this collection two manicured thumbs up!</li>
    <li> The box of polishes arrived on time and everything was carefully and tightly packaged so nothing was damaged. I received all 12 colors and I am super excited to try them all! So far I have tried 6 out of the 12 and have been very impressed. This is my first time using China Glaze and I am officially a fan. All the opaque ones were very opaque, and all the shimmery ones were extremely shimmery. The only color that I was expecting to be more opaque is Fast Track. It turned out sheerer than I was expecting, but it is still a very pretty color regardless. And the two glitter nail polishes, \\&quot;Luxe and Lush\\&quot; and \\&quot;Electrify\\&quot;...can&#x27;t get enough of them! They are so pretty when layered on top of another color. my nails still looked good after a week with minuscule chips that only I would seem notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the more neutral colors like \\&quot;Dress Me Up\\&quot; and \\&quot;Fois Gras\\&quot; I think are pretty common (but pretty!) colors that can be found in other brands, but this set is such a steal! Even though there are only 10 fingers and 10 toes to try them all on, it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to a nail polish junkie! Love the collection and the colors that are in it, minus the brown. Other then that the gift was a hit!</li>
    <li> This nail polish never gets tacky. These colors are perfect for fall! I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments each time I wear these colors. It is very fun to apply some of these colors over each other or adding an accent nail that goes with the rest.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE these colors!  They represent the districts so well.  Are there going to be more colors when the new movie comes out?</li>
    <li> I purchased this collection based off a review I had read and I don&#x27;t regret it! The colors are great and, if you know what you&#x27;re doing, your manicure will last really long. I love it and can already tell you that this collection will be used A LOT:)</li>
    <li> as i was hoping it to be. china glaze is the best. the colors are nice, also the shimmery ones have really nice chromatic. great, great, great!</li>
    <li> I love this collection.  Be careful of the green, it stains your nails.  I am having so much fun with this set!</li>
    <li> I purchased for the sole idea of having a limited edition hunger games polish set. There are some colors I stronly dislike. But others I love. Great product but a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> I must start by saying that this item was bought as a gift for my granddaughter who is a &amp;#34;Hunger Game&amp;#34; fan and have therfore, not used any of the polish.  I know that my nail salon uses China Glaze polish, so I&#x27;m presuming that these will be good.  I just the idea of one for each of the districts!</li>
    <li> colors are great but the polish doesn&#x27;t last very long on my natural nails. starts to chip just after a few hours and that&#x27;s with a clear top coat.</li>
    <li> I was a lil skeptical about getting these colors since some of em are not to my liking. I love nail polish n wouldn&#x27;t want to waste money on something that I didnt like. I was totally surprised these are very nice colors. So glad I got my collection definitely beat my expectations :)</li>
    <li> This collection is gorgeous! There isn&#x27;t a single color in this list that I don&#x27;t like, and 12 polishes for $33 is unbeatable, especially China Glaze! I would make this purchase again in a heartbeat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the colors go on smoothly, and look gorgeous on. The only thing is that Lush and Luxe is definitely a top coat that doesn&#x27;t really go over any of the other colors in the collection. I haven&#x27;t yet tried a few layers to see if it could be wearable on it&#x27;s own.</li>
