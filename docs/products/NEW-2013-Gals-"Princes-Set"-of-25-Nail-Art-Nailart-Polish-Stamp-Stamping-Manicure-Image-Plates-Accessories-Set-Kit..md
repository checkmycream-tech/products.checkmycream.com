<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the wide variety of designs in this nailart stamp kit, but I wish it had more image designs and not so many of the &amp;#34;entire nail&amp;#34; designs.</li>
    <li> Some of the images are pretty similar, but overall it is a great selection and works well.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> These are some of the best stamping plates I&#x27;ve bought. The designs are really intricate and stamp on crisply. The edges of the plates are sharp though so be careful!</li>
    <li> I really love these plates.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the set I got. I bought two more for my family as gifts.  I love all the designs and they work great.</li>
    <li> Awesome patterns Love the compact size</li>
    <li> It Not Good at All...I would recommended this to other customers! The plate design doesn&#x27;t cut deep enough for the paint to sink in it..so when I try to scraped the polish off and stamped the design on the finger it does not show ass a design at all but a smeer paint!!! Not a good one... Please don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
    <li> Bought these for a friend but like them so much i had to keep them for myself and got my friend something eles next on my tll list is the fairy set love cheeky nail stuff and are great value for money and delivery is always on time or before</li>
    <li> WOW the design are gorgeous... compare to store buy, well this one kicks rear... perfect to make your own crazy design with out paying an arm and leg for them,</li>
    <li> This is a good product but the stamper I got does not work</li>
    <li> Got duplicates but still happy with product.</li>
    <li> The product has many many designs. I work hard to decide one to put on my nails. but, all the plates are good. The box contains a QR code to see others ways to use the plates or to do other styles</li>
    <li> these are great plates. The fast that they are from Cheeky make them good from the start. Wish the images were a bt bigger for longer nails and wider nail bed but over all good. Good engraving and great stamping. highly recommend</li>
    <li> some of them work and other dont.</li>
    <li> some of the pics too big</li>
    <li> Somewhat confused as to how useful a lot of these can truly be. Also, do your research on the best kinds of polish to use with these plates, because you cannot effectively use just any polish with stamps. I prefer to free-hand my nail art but if you don&#x27;t have that kind of patience, try the stamps. You&#x27;ll definitely find designs you like.</li>
    <li> I got these right away and couldn&#x27;t wait to use them. The scraper I bought didn&#x27;t work as well with these plates as I thought it would but I didn&#x27;t buy the special polish. I&#x27;m going to be purchasing it soon to see if it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> This set comes with a ridiculous amount of stamps for a very low cost. I was happy. Some of the stamps are a little weird, but some are just down right awesome. Worth the buy for me!</li>
    <li> These stamping plates are WONDERFUL! I have used some very bad plates in the past. For the price they are even better. The selection is also very great. Very comparable to Konad plates for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used about half these plates. Or should I say, I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;tried&amp;#34; to use these plates. These are TERRIBLE! I&#x27;ve done everything, used every trick in the book, but after I scrape off the excess polish, the design will NOT stick to the stamper. And don&#x27;t say I&#x27;m not doing it right, I&#x27;ve been using nail stamping plates for a while, MASH makes some good ones, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them. These designs are cute, really they are, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such a bummer that I can&#x27;t get them to pick up! It&#x27;s so frustrating. I&#x27;ll never buy any of these plates EVER again.</li>
    <li> Loving it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &#x3D;) easy to use with great design!&lt;br /&gt;You will have fun while you doing nail stamping artwork!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping with good value product! Will return to buy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> My stamper does not pick up the whole image like it does with my konad plates. Whenever it does pick up part if the image, it looks like crap.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these.!!! It was my first time buying anything like this, so it took some getting used to, as far as stamping them onto my nails. I only wish that it would have included a stamper/scraper. I had to order it separately.</li>
    <li> 5 star I absolutely love em they work great and look super cute definitely worth the money super fast shipment</li>
    <li> Item as described the 2013 Gals \\&quot;Princes Set\\&quot; of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit images are very nice.  Good product and an excellent transaction-- thank you</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, well packaged.  I love these plates very nice designs , protective backing, design transfers easly will buy more.  5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it sats, but plates contain mostly whole-nail designs. I would hace enjoyed more small designs. Otherwise it works perfectly. Designs come sharply onto your nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I needed an easy way to designed my nails and this item works very well i would diffidently buy this item again</li>
    <li> my sister purchased this but when i saw it there were a lot of cool designs that she put on her nails and i would recommend this if you like doing your nails and want variation.</li>
    <li> They just don&#x27;t fit all my nails because of its size but I would still have boughten it again... And would recommend it to others...</li>
    <li> have yet to use them but i have checked them out cant wait to use them great very small which i like because i have small hands and not very long fingernails</li>
    <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
    <li> I am SO happy about this set! There are many different designs. These plates are very easy to use and don&#x27;t require the Konrad stamping polish.</li>
    <li> Getting the designs on perfectly is not an easy task, but that&#x27;s where practicing comes in.  Great and durable plates.</li>
    <li> I love these plates along with the sister set, \\&quot;Fairy\\&quot;....they are of awesome quality and stamp wonderfully.  Some reviews talk of the \\&quot;smallness\\&quot; of the images....I have small nails, and keep them short for work...so these are perfect for me. And seasoned stampers know how to \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; an image out...so don&#x27;t let that stop you from getting these!!!  I am pleased and would recommend them to any one!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my stamps! some of the designs didn&#x27;t stamp because its not cut deep enough and it was usually the ones I like...ugh Please cheeky fix this so I can give you five stars.</li>
    <li> I own a nail salon and these nail plates are very useful. They create designs in seconds which saves me time and my clients love them. I really like these plates particularly because the designs are big enough to fit adult hands. I will definitely buy more plates from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping the image on the plate would cover my whole nail but it doesn&#x27;t so I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this set and like many of the patterns.  For the most part these work really well, stamping clearly, and the plates, while a little thin, are fully backed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away a star because a few of the patterns have too much negative space to fill properly and become nearly impossible to use.  But, more than that, the curve at the bottom of the all over patterns as well as their narrow width mean they don&#x27;t fit on some nails.</li>
    <li> Some of my plates seemed to of have been mishandled and with scratches, other than that the plates stamp fine.</li>
    <li> these do NOT fill the nail...</li>
    <li> Another great set of plates from this company. WAITING ON MORE SETS TO COME OUT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great images! Comes out clear and precise. I will be buying from Gals again!</li>
    <li> Fun to play with, nice designs</li>
    <li> Worth every penny . Coming from a cosmetologist they&#x27;re well made and work extremely well.</li>
    <li> Works well. However, some of the plate designs are smaller and don&#x27;t work well for longer nails. You can try to stamp it again in the missed blank areas and try to line it up but that can be tricky sometimes.</li>
    <li> even though I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use any YET I looked through and cant wait !!!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this set because im more of the geometric design kind of person. also i have small nails so it works quite well, maybe not on my thumb but no biggy. i do recommend this product to those that have small nail beds though. if you have long nails, this set isnt for you, unless you like a small designs on your nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift but they were so beautiful that I had to buy another gift for my friend. They stampped very well. I do not use a special stampping polish.</li>
    <li> great stamping plates i recomend them if you love stamping!</li>
    <li> Great!!!!! Fabulous Designs</li>
    <li> These work great! Nice sized images</li>
    <li> Like others, I was very excited about the new sets as I am a big fan of the other Cheeky plate disc sets and XL stamping plates.  This set was the first one available on Amazon, so I snapped it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: good plate design mix.  There are a lot of designs you&#x27;re going to find in any plate set (houndstooth, for example) for a beginner who wants the basics, but also enough all-purpose new designs to make the set worth considering if you already have a couple of sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Image size.  The &#x27;half moon&#x27; bottom of the full plate images shrinks what would be a reasonable size image for short-medium nails to unusable.  Full plate image dimensions would have been 5/8\\&quot; long x 1/2\\&quot; wide, but with the half moon cutout, it shrinks to just over 1/2\\&quot; long x 1/2\\&quot; wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who should buy this: People with very small nail beds, people with short-medium nails who like having a half-moon cutout on each nail, people with long (but not wide) nails who like french tip designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to give these to a small-nailed friend, because I just can&#x27;t use them.  I don&#x27;t have long nails. I keep them trimmed to about 1/8\\&quot; from the quick, and don&#x27;t do french tip designs because I don&#x27;t have enough &#x27;tip&#x27; for the designs to be visible!</li>
    <li> I love these plates, their images are very nice, will buy again for sure more kits of their plates ! ;)</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2MV2YK3CYNKQZ]]Here I am showing you that these plates do stamp flawlessly. :)</li>
    <li> I got these plates and have been really impressed with the image quality. I have to take a star off because after a few times of using the plates, the backing starts to peel off. The backing feels like a similar plastic to the blue protective covering, only glued on better. Please be careful when using these plates after the backing starts to peel because the edges on the plates are very sharp. I love the images, though, and will replace the backings myself once they completely come off.</li>
    <li> Mt granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Most work very well. Different nail polishes provide various results. Experiment!</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I have thin nail beds, and I like to keep my nails cut short.  That said, I looove this set.  I wish I had bought it sooner.  I use it more than my other 3 sets put together.  No problems stamping at all.  Designs are great.  I especially love the travel themed plate.</li>
    <li> The images are crisp and clear.  They stamp beautifully.  Lots of unique images.  Great overall quality, I definitely am glad to have these in my collection.  And a great price too!</li>
    <li> Love the patterns in this set, they are very feminine and individual. Its a nice complementary set to the Gals &amp;#34;Fairy Set&amp;#34; which is more geometric</li>
    <li> This set does a great job of holding the paint so it&#x27;s easy to get the imprint. You will however need A LOT of patience when using these type of printing discs because they need to be wiped clean after each use (you have to wait for each nail to dry and carefully use acetone without removing the polish on your nails). The quality of the stamps are excellent and I&#x27;m tempted to buy a another set as a gift.</li>
    <li> These stamp very clear and I was very impressed :) The images are not huge but at least the same as the original cheeky plates not as big as the summer plates though.</li>
    <li> I love this set of stamping plates. I have yet to find an image that does not come out precise, clear and perfect.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of using it its great! the designs are clear and fun! remember to get polishes that work well, that are thick and opaque or the images wont come out well, not because of the design but because of of the type of polish. ANd dont forget to order a scraper and stamper if you dont already have them.</li>
    <li> The product&#x27;s images r relatively small on my finger nail and not deep enough but i cant coplain much about the product since i am a beginner</li>
    <li> While these look like nice quality plates, the full nail designs are TINY, even more so than many other plates. I thought since Gals are products made by Cheeky, they&#x27;d be the size of newer CHeeky products - they are not. The individual designs don&#x27;t have much detail, and there aren&#x27;t many of them. The nail tip designs, are oddly large considering how small the \\&quot;full\\&quot; nail designs are, but since I file my nails to an oval shape, they aren&#x27;t much use to me unless I want to put them in the middle of my nail. So once again, I have another collection of plates that won&#x27;t fit my thumbs or even moderate length nails. Each is 1/2 inch wide by 1/2 inch tall, from the center, so actually SMALLER than Konad because of the rounded base.&lt;br /&gt;If you have small and short nails, then you&#x27;ll probably enjoy these. If you are a professional who has to deal with many nail sizes, stick with the Cheeky XL plates or just don&#x27;t taunt your customers with larger nails with these designs so they won&#x27;t know about what they can&#x27;t have. Or get busy coming up with a different design for thumbs. I like the ease of picking a plate and knowing it will work on all of my nails. I guess that&#x27;s too much to expect again. Big waste of my money.</li>
    <li> These are great quality. I just used a plain over the counter .99 white polish. You can see the word &amp;#34;Kisses&amp;#34; perfect. I also have the Fairy Set.</li>
    <li> I just received these plates (along with the other matching set- the Fairy set). I ripped the package open and was so excited I had to try them out right away!!  &#x3D;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a LOT of stamping plates and other nail art stuff in general. I&#x27;m not an expert, but a very dedicated fan, lets say... ;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These plates have some awesome designs!!!  The variety you receive is wonderful- full nail designs, French plates, and individual images galore...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the full nail images are not as large as the images are on the new CHEEKY plates.  They were definitely large enough for my nails as they are right now- I have them fairly short at the moment- sport length I&#x27;d say.  It seems to me that since the line is called &amp;#34;Gals,&amp;#34; it is meant for smaller fingers / shorter nails. Maybe intended more for the younger market.  However, if you heave shorter length nails like me, these at going to be perfect!!! No again, an awesome value.  There are way more plates I&#x27;d use than plates I won&#x27;t.  ;0) I can&#x27;t say that about some other sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The etching is definitely good quality. The plates are not thin and bendy at all- they are a good thickness and strong. Each one has the blue film on the top- it removes as easily as most sets I own- start peeling from the edge and it comes off very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also love the fact that the backing is black- my other plates with a sticker on back are all white- after I use them, there is always polish on the back and when I try to clean it off, it will either take the printing with it or just smear around and not come clean.  The black backing is much nicer- looks more finished and not at all messy when I&#x27;m done- polish cleans off it way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both sets are a awesome value!! I prefer the designs onthe princess set- I love love love that there is a faux bios design (wood grain!!!!!). I also love that there are complimentary designs- there are a few different sizes and orientations ofsimilar designs so you can create a unique mani that is matching but not all the same or &amp;#34;matchy-matchy&amp;#34; if that makes any sense... &#x3D;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I love is the packaging- most other plates come with each plate packaged in its own cello bag. Such a waste!! It takes a lot of time to open each bag and remove the plates and they always end up in the trash right away! &#x3D;0(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These plates come with no bags- the whole stack is housed neatly in a little square box.  I love that!! &#x3D;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is- I LOVE THEM!!!  if you like stamping, these sets (Princess and Fairy) are a must buy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for your time and Happy Stamping!!!  XD</li>
    <li> I bought both Fairy Set and Princess Set and have no complaints with either; they both stamp well and have loads of cool designs.  Lots of full size images which are handy to use for a quick mani.  The box is handy to keep them all together for storage and travelling!</li>
    <li> Like the patterns a lot and they work perfectly fine once you understand how it all works. They&#x27;re great :)</li>
    <li> I like this set of stamping plates.  This set has a ton of great geometric designs (that are otherwise hard to do freehand) to choose from.  Protective films were very easy to remove.  And these plates are small enough to fit the pockets of the Bundle Monster Plate case.  Great Price too!</li>
    <li> Even though the discs are rather small, they do have great designs. The only thing is that I haven&#x27;t found the right nail polish.</li>
    <li> I loved these plates. They are a little smaller than other brands, so the images are smaller, but my fingers are small anyway so it does not bother me. Would not work for larger nails though.</li>
    <li> I havent had a chance to use the stamps but i received the complete set and the designs were great.  This was a good set for the price.</li>
    <li> I do my own gel nails at home and saw this in a salon and thought wow i have to have that!!  so i bought the stamper, and nail polish that goes with it. once they all came i took off my current nails so i could redo them and use this, I kept trying different designs and taking them off bc i couldnt decide on which on i liked the most.&lt;br /&gt;I have enough designs to last me for a long time. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I just received the plates. They came very quickly. I was appreciative of the speediness. I was expecting all 25 plates to each have different designs. Seen quite a bit of repetition. However still excited to use the plates. Oh yea i figured they would be bigger kinda small.</li>
    <li> Arrived just in time for my granddaughters Christmas gift.  However, Amazon did not tell us that we needed additional scrapper and stamp pad for these to work on the nails. So, my granddaughter couldn&#x27;t use them until she purchased the other needed products to use the disk. Once we did receive it was a little difficult to find the right tutorial on-line to see how these work in doing your nails, that&#x27;s when we discovered that we needed the scrapper and stamp pad.</li>
    <li> i had ordered these plates based on the picture shown i thought those were the ones i would be receiving i got none of the ones that were shown at all. they were completely diff. designs. yes the ones i received were awesome but i would of lived getting the ones i thought i was paying for.</li>
    <li> We had a lot fun with these</li>
    <li> I purchased these plates as soon as they became available and at the time I had to wait for them to ship from China. I received them after 5 weeks. And they were surprisingly very well etched. The designs are all geometrical shapes. However, the designs are not like the XL Cheeky images which I love since I have large nail beds. That&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t give these plates 5 stars. The designs are way too small for a nice even roll on my fingers especially my thumbs which I have to double stamp causing a overlap in design giving it a messy look. I may have learned my lesson and just stick to the XL plates. But these are a nice addition to my collection, just don&#x27;t see myself using these often...</li>
    <li> This is the first plate set I&#x27;ve bought for my brand-new Konad stamper, and I&#x27;m thrilled with them. I have fairly small hands and nails - I wouldn&#x27;t call them tiny - and the full nail designs were big enough to give me a bit of overlap even on my thumbnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The designs are beautifully etched and stamp like a dream. I did purchase one individual plate from another company, and that one wasn&#x27;t etched deeply enough; it made me REALLY appreciate this set. Without even practicing, and using ordinary nail polish (gold chrome from Wet n&#x27; Wild, and black from Color Cosmetic), I stamped all 10 nails and each one of them turned out great. I&#x27;m so torn - I can&#x27;t wait to try more of the designs with different colors, but my manicure looks so good I don&#x27;t want to take it off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super fast and the plates were in a nice little box, which I&#x27;m going to keep them in. The plates arrived in perfect condition, all accounted for, none missing and no dupes. I&#x27;d definitely buy another set - got my eye on the Fairy set next.</li>
    <li> These stamp great  I havent had a chance to use them all but those i have used are very well engraved</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews about the images being too small to fit on the nail, but these being the cheapest plates I could find with good reviews and prime shipping, I bought them anyway. I figured my nails weren&#x27;t that long and the images would fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews were right - the images are too small. The only fingernail I could fit the images onto was my pinky. But I found a solution soon enough - google &amp;#34;stretching nail stamping image&amp;#34; and watch the nailstamp4fun&#x27;s video on YouTube. She shows you how to stretch a small image using a squishy stamper. I used her technique with these plates and it worked like a charm. I was able to fit the images perfectly even onto my thumb nail. If you don&#x27;t want to go through the extra step of stretching your image, then you might want to consider buying other plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the other quality of the plates - I&#x27;m very pleased with them. These are good plates to practice with. I&#x27;ve gotten a clean stamp with *most* of the images I&#x27;ve tried so far and I just started stamping 4 days ago.</li>
    <li> I like it and I&#x27;ll said it works okay. Fast shipping and great product. Brand new item plus cute stuff in the plate</li>
    <li> I had bought one of these before and loved them and decided to get this set also because they are so much fun!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the designs as soon as my Konad stamper gets here I&#x27;m going to be designing nail left to right! LoL . Thanks &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> These seem to be nice plates except they are small, which is ok if you have short nails or are just going to use them for french tips!</li>
    <li> Well, these stamp great.  They are well packaged and exactly what I was expecting.  The only negative is the half moon shape of the full nail stamps.  It makes them a bit small for full nails.  I&#x27;m not much of a fan of the half moon look and stamping.  Luckily I have quite short nails so it isn&#x27;t a problem for me.  May be a problem for people with long nails/nail beds.  Other than that these are great.  The price is amazing!  Why isn&#x27;t the Fairy set this cheap?  I actually like the designs in the other set better, good thing I bought both.</li>
    <li> Im so excited got both my fairy and princess set today, have not try it out yet. The reason im rating 4 stars is due to my envelope was teared when i got it, i guess its too heavy for both set to be pack in one fragile envelope. Im lucky that none of the box is drop out. Another down side is i got a duplicate and miss out plate, BUT cheeky team was great for their customer service. I just got the replied from them that they will send me the missing plate and i can keep the duplicate one. Omg that was a very fast responsed and im very satisfied of the way that cheeky solved my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheeky definitely worth a 5 stars rating if the plates image gonna transfer well (i have not try the plates so im still giving a 4 stars ^^) and improve on the parcel packaging.. Overall, im a fan of cheeky plates still!</li>
    <li> It came right in time for my wife.  She likes it and wants to buy more.</li>
    <li> Love all the geometric shapes. but that&#x27;s about it. Transfer well too. They came in nice packaging and nice backings.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! There are endless possibilities for nail art! I will never pay to get my nails done again!</li>
    <li> It is good for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing.</li>
    <li> ton of options. received faster then expected. It came less then 72 hours. the plates are clear and stamps really clearly.</li>
    <li> Fun designs, stamp well. No problems with what I have tried so far. Having a good time playing with these plates.</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations when I ordered this set.&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively small nails, but these motives are so ridiculously small that I simply can&#x27;t use most of the set. I&#x27;m sorry to say that this was a waste of money for me. Only buy this set if you have got tiny nails!</li>
    <li> Without a doubt cheeky puts out my favorite plates and the gals sets are adorable. There are many images that I fell are geared to the little ones and that is a plus in my book.</li>
    <li> I really like this plates, they all work really good, the are perfect size for my nails, and they&#x27;re cheap, I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> I really like this set. The images stamp crisp &amp; clear. The only problem is that the images are really short especially with the half moon. I have to either double stamp or use the images as tip designs. Waiting for more plates from you GALS without the half moon :) .</li>
    <li> I have no problems with these plates so far... Just remember to remove the blue film before using and clean your plates with acetone after each use. Btw, they scratch easy so use a old gift card not the scraper that ones with your kits.... Enjoy this worthy buy!</li>
    <li> Absolutly gorgeous... very nice!  Fast shipping.  I can wait to start using them.&lt;br /&gt;I will be sending you my pictures!!!  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> such amazing designs. fast delivery, great designs, no flaws, transfers well. 5 stars all the way. also got the other &amp;#34; fairy set: equally as amazing as this one.</li>
    <li> even with my short nails, most of the designs are too small to fill my full nail bed.  This is particularly disappointing since I had hoped they would be on the larger side based on a youtube review.  Good designs but not workable even on short and small nails.</li>
    <li> First off, I bought these and they said they wouldn&#x27;t be in for like 4 weeks...It only took a week and a half! That was great.  I love doing fun things with my nails and this just opened the doors for new designs.  I love these stamp pads and I would definately buy more of them.</li>
    <li> I was looking at these plates online and I noticed that the plates didn&#x27;t look the same.&lt;br /&gt;on 12 of the plates one or two images are different some look half etched.&lt;br /&gt;other than that they are okay.</li>
