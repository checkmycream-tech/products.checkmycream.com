      <li>Best way is to dab it on with</li>
      <li>Its the best...</li>
      <li>I agree it works best when you pat it on.  </li>
      <li>I am very impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>It will stay put all day and give you a flawless finish</li>
      <li>To my surprise the &amp;#34;effect&amp;#34; lasted a good 6 hours!</li>
      <li>All the on-air personalities use  it in order to look great on HDTV.</li>
      <li>and I almost don&#x27;t want to tell others how great it is.</li>
      <li>Great product, it&#x27;s used on any scars or cuts on face and hands.</li>
      <li>I also feel like some of my finer wrinkles are greatly reduced in appearance with this on.</li>
      <li>Great quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great when you cover with a bit of foundation too.</li>
      <li>A GREAT ONE NIGHT OPTIC EFFECT</li>
      <li>But I do feel like it takes a good 5 years off of my face just for the fact that it&#x27;s like a mini photoshop in a bottle.</li>
      <li>product does give a great optical illusion of near flawless skin.</li>
      <li>I love the product!</li>
      <li>Amazing how Nanoblur softens your face.  </li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this.</li>
      <li>It can also be used on make-up free skin, to decrease shine &amp; blur the appearance of pores, so it&#x27;s also a great product for men, or lovely ladies with no need for make-up.</li>
      <li>so if am going to be outside all day I will wear that instead because it&#x27;s good to have layered sunscreen if you are going to be in the sun for many hours,  but this one is superior to that!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Matte,  but glowing and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would be more like a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not at all.</li>
      <li>I like it better than the Monistat Chaffing Gel that I was using.</li>
      <li>For me, personally, this stuff works best if I use it as a primer.</li>
      <li>I love Nanoblur.</li>
      <li>The directions say to use it on top of your foundation.</li>
      <li>it on top of foundation</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>but I like it &amp; use it on often :)</li>
      <li>(I need both!) :)</li>
      <li>luck!, or lovely ladies with no need for make-up.</li>
      <li>There are too many better items on the market that work much better than this.</li>
      <li>(I need both!) :)</li>
      <li>It could be that it works better for some skin types than others.</li>
      <li>It makes your scars blend more into the skin.</li>
      <li>I also love Miracle Blur by loreal because it has sunscreen in it</li>
      <li>/&gt;After finding success, now my foundation (Exuviance) and Nanoblur is now all I need for me to feel like my skin looks pretty good!</li>
      <li>It goes on like a cream but dries quickly and kind of pulls your face taut.</li>
      <li>It does help to blur my pores and fine lines.</li>
      <li>People think I have great skin health all of a sudden, and I&#x27;m gonna let them continue to think that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>when it is on, quickly smooth it out before it dries.  </li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s a dollar cheaper at my local Walgreen&#x27;s), but it&#x27;s quite remarkable</li>
      <li>Plus I got hit on by a guy who&#x27;s a good 6-7 years younger than myself, so that says something.</li>
      <li>I would say that it knocks off a good 5 years, especially around the eyes.</li>
      <li>but I definitely look better after using it :)</li>
      <li>I have a better product that I purchased for $11.99 that does an even better job, because it actually softens the lines over time and they almost fade away.  </li>
      <li>I use a foundation brush to apply my concealer and it works for me, I just brush quickly.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely  thrilled with the instant result using Indeed Nanoblur.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I put it on twice and took it off right away.  </li>
      <li>If you can find it like I first did (a \\&quot;try me\\&quot; tester on display)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Nanoblur may not make you look 10 years younger, and not that I&#x27;m exactly \\&quot;old\\&quot; and I personally haven&#x27;t had anyone tell me I look younger, but my self-confidence in the appearance of my face is best when I have this on.</li>
      <li>When I first tried it, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions and if you *rub* it onto the skin over foundation</li>
      <li>but I have an exceptionally rough face and it wasn&#x27;t as effective as I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>My first time to use it.  </li>
      <li>Of course I was happy with the results but wondered how long it would last.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>If you can find it like I first did (a \\&quot;try me\\&quot; tester on display)</li>
      <li>:) I am of mixed racial background with a super oily T-Zone, and drier cheeks, so I mainly use it in my T-Zone.</li>
      <li>My skin looks flawless when I wear it, albeit a little dry.  </li>
      <li>However, for fear of the product being discontinued one day due to mixed reviews I have seen online, I want to make sure many people know how great it is because after trying this, Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how I ever thought I looked acceptable without it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Life long goal :))</li>
      <li>use a decent moisturizing foundation, then before the foundation is completely set, will put the Nanoblur on and gently, yet quickly smooth it in.  </li>
      <li>It also minimizes some large pores.</li>
      <li>I am in my mid 40s with oily skin, enlarged pores and some fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>This product is OK, but be careful when applying it.</li>
      <li>terrific product - goes on smooth and blends in.....</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for this product.</li>
      <li>Really works....amazing</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>Helped smooth out lines under my eyes and made my pores appear way smaller.</li>
      <li>Here is how I use Nanoblur and what works best for me: I wash my face, apply my Vitamin C serum, my sunscreen, then use approximately the size of a grain of rice (of the Nanoblur) for my entire face, then my Skin 79 BB Cream (I use that in lieu of foundation).</li>
      <li>I mainly use this product for hand modeling auditions and jobs.</li>
      <li>This product works well if used correctly, but can look like a complete mess very easily.</li>
      <li>I am a male and occasionally wear light makeup.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about three weeks now and finally feel comfortable enough to write a review.</li>
      <li>If I could make my face stop being so oily/shiny &amp; have clear skin then I wouldn&#x27;t need to use any product at all!</li>
      <li>I doubt I look 10 years younger, but this product does something that NO other product in my life has done for me -- keep my face from getting really oily!  </li>
      <li>and I pass for early 40&#x27;s, so</li>
      <li>I have tried every &#x27;oil absorbing&#x27; product I can find, but this is the only product that works for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artist/ professional and thought I would give this a try.  </li>
      <li>The key here is to not put too much on and</li>
      <li>your finger go do something until it dries and then rub softly.</li>
      <li>Not really tight or anything</li>
      <li>:) A little Nanoblur goes a LONG way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After applying your foundation, rub a small amount between your fingers to make it a bit more fluid</li>
      <li>It has not made my skin too dry even now in the middle of winter when it would be most likely to be dry.  </li>
      <li>With makeup or alone it makes my skin appear smooth and the wrinkles and slight bags were less noticeable.</li>
      <li>but Nanoblur has a less intense smell and feels softer on my skin.</li>

<li> but makes you face feel really dry.</li>
<li> Also makes skin look very dry and shows every line.  </li>
<li> Since I use so little of it, the 1 ounce tube should last well over a year.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I do do not wear foundation anymore,  I put this on after my sunscreen and it makes my face look  like a baby&#x27;s butt all day... Matte,  but glowing and healthy looking.  I put a little Sonia Kashuk Chic Luminosity Glow powder over it with a little powder blusher and I&#x27;m set for the day! I also love Miracle Blur by loreal because it has sunscreen in it so if am going to be outside all day I will wear that instead because it&#x27;s good to have layered sunscreen if you are going to be in the sun for many hours,  but this one is superior to that!</li>
    <li> This product is a holy grail product for me. I haven&#x27;t ordered it online (it&#x27;s a dollar cheaper at my local Walgreen&#x27;s), but it&#x27;s quite remarkable and I almost don&#x27;t want to tell others how great it is. It&#x27;s hard for a girl to give up her secrets! However, for fear of the product being discontinued one day due to mixed reviews I have seen online, I want to make sure many people know how great it is because after trying this, Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how I ever thought I looked acceptable without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A creamy, white, almost lotion like cream in a tube. It has no discernible scent that I can tell. It dries colorless, and would work equally well for men as well as women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claims:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes you look 10 years younger in 45 seconds. I&#x27;m not sure about that. But I do feel like it takes a good 5 years off of my face just for the fact that it&#x27;s like a mini photoshop in a bottle. I do have a couple of deeper wrinkles (forehead elevens) that nothing but botox will probably fix, however; this product isn&#x27;t meant to remove/reduce deep wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does give a great optical illusion of near flawless skin. This stuff does \\&quot;blur\\&quot; my pores and give me a matte finish that no powder ever could without looking cakey. I also feel like some of my finer wrinkles are greatly reduced in appearance with this on. Now that I&#x27;ve found this product, I just use my liquid foundation (wait about 5 minutes for it to dry &amp; set) and rub a small amount of Nanoblur between my fingers then gently pat it over my foundation as instructed on the box. It works like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me &amp; my skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t reveal my age, but I am a female between 21-35. :) I am of mixed racial background with a super oily T-Zone, and drier cheeks, so I mainly use it in my T-Zone. I feel like Nanoblur keeps me from being an oil slick at the end of the day and helps my makeup stay on. I try to use as few products as possible because I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin. Being that my T-zone is oily, I try not to touch my face at all after using this, for fear that I will wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use a primer. I tried one once and I broke out after using it, so I try to be very careful about what I use on my face. Being skeptical of this breaking me out (like most products with glycerin in them), I tried a sample of this product for a couple weeks by using the product in the display \\&quot;try me\\&quot; tube at my local Walgreens. I wanted to make sure it would work for me, plus it&#x27;s not the cheapest thing to buy with the some of the bad reviews I read &amp; being currently unemployed, so I just took a little bit of it home with me in the palm of my hand...&lt;br /&gt;Hey now, don&#x27;t judge! :) A little Nanoblur goes a LONG way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finding success, now my foundation (Exuviance) and Nanoblur is now all I need for me to feel like my skin looks pretty good! I can&#x27;t wait until my skin is clearer, then I may finally get to forego foundation all together and just use Nanoblur by itself. If I could make my face stop being so oily/shiny &amp; have clear skin then I wouldn&#x27;t need to use any product at all! (Life long goal :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nanoblur may not make you look 10 years younger, and not that I&#x27;m exactly \\&quot;old\\&quot; and I personally haven&#x27;t had anyone tell me I look younger, but my self-confidence in the appearance of my face is best when I have this on. Plus I got hit on by a guy who&#x27;s a good 6-7 years younger than myself, so that says something. ;) Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this. I have read a lot of mixed reviews on Nanoblur. When I first tried it, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions and if you *rub* it onto the skin over foundation it IS a disaster. However, if you *pat* it on top of foundation it is a dream. It can also be used on make-up free skin, to decrease shine &amp; blur the appearance of pores, so it&#x27;s also a great product for men, or lovely ladies with no need for make-up. If you can find it like I first did (a \\&quot;try me\\&quot; tester on display) definitely try it out! Even if you can&#x27;t, I still swear by this product. Maybe Boots will see my review and offer me a job &amp; lifetime supply of Nanoblur. (I need both!) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!, or lovely ladies with no need for make-up. If you can find it like I first did (a \\&quot;try me\\&quot; tester on display) definitely try it out! Even if you can&#x27;t, I still swear by this product.

    <li> Amazing how Nanoblur softens your face.  Especially when applying after a bit of foundation.</li>
    <li> I have been using nanoblur for a year now and it really works. Best way is to dab it on with your finger go do something until it dries and then rub softly. Its the best...</li>
    <li> This suff is awful.  I&#x27;m a makeup artist/ professional and thought I would give this a try.  Even with the smallest amount it clumps up and looks caked.  Doesn&#x27;t even mix well with other products or work overtop of makeup.  Also makes skin look very dry and shows every line.  Loser of a item... don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  There are too many better items on the market that work much better than this.</li>
    <li> This product was quite a find. With makeup or alone it makes my skin appear smooth and the wrinkles and slight bags were less noticeable. I would definately by Nanoblur again</li>
    <li> The Nanoblur did blur the lines the way it was supposed to but I have an exceptionally rough face and it wasn&#x27;t as effective as I had hoped.  I have a better product that I purchased for $11.99 that does an even better job, because it actually softens the lines over time and they almost fade away.  Therefore, I give it 4 out of 5 stars for doing what they said it would do, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase the product again.</li>
    <li> Overall it does tighten my facial skin, doesn&#x27;t take off ten years but I like it &amp; use it on often :)</li>
    <li> The directions say to apply over make-up, but I think this creates a cakey-look. Not a look that I desire.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now and finally feel comfortable enough to write a review. I have found that there is a learning curve with this stuff. The directions say to use it on top of your foundation. I do NOT use it that way. For me, personally, this stuff works best if I use it as a primer. I am in my mid 40s with oily skin, enlarged pores and some fine lines and wrinkles. Here is how I use Nanoblur and what works best for me: I wash my face, apply my Vitamin C serum, my sunscreen, then use approximately the size of a grain of rice (of the Nanoblur) for my entire face, then my Skin 79 BB Cream (I use that in lieu of foundation). I have found that a little bit of the Nanoblur goes a long way. I have not had any issues with the Nanoblur reacting with the sunscreen or the BB Cream. It does help to blur my pores and fine lines. Since I use so little of it, the 1 ounce tube should last well over a year. I like it better than the Monistat Chaffing Gel that I was using. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Picked this up at CVS and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I thought this would be more like a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not at all. It goes on like a cream but dries quickly and kind of pulls your face taut. Not really tight or anything but makes you face feel really dry. I use powder as a foundation but do use a liquid concealer under my eyes. I put it on after my moisturizer and BEFORE my concealer or powder. I know it says to put it on after liquid make up but I don&#x27;t. I use a foundation brush to apply my concealer and it works for me, I just brush quickly. Also if you do use it on top of liquid make up, PAT don&#x27;t rub or it will look horrible. Of course I was happy with the results but wondered how long it would last. To my surprise the &amp;#34;effect&amp;#34; lasted a good 6 hours! Helped smooth out lines under my eyes and made my pores appear way smaller. I think it&#x27;s keeper.</li>
    <li> I doubt I look 10 years younger, but this product does something that NO other product in my life has done for me -- keep my face from getting really oily!  I have tried every &#x27;oil absorbing&#x27; product I can find, but this is the only product that works for me. It also minimizes some large pores. It has not made my skin too dry even now in the middle of winter when it would be most likely to be dry.  It lasts all day too. I am very impressed with this product. I hope it holds up as well during the summer heat and humidity. ( FYI, I am age 50+, and have oily skin since a teenager prone to break outs even now and have a bit of rosacea now too! )&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I apply Nanoblur over my usual moisturizer, then put my foundation over it a few minutes later, so I am using it like a primer, but not my entire face - just the T zone and cheeks.</li>
    <li> terrific product - goes on smooth and blends in.....i use a powder base foundation.  Not sure how it works if you use a liquid foundation though. You only need to apply a very little amount and it covers your whole face. Plus, your face (or at least mine) does not become shiny throughout the day!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. It&#x27;s a small tube that not worth the price nor the shipping. It did nothing for my skin</li>
    <li> Nice product. I am a male and occasionally wear light makeup. This product works well as a pore refining base under powder but I also use it by itself for no makeup days. I have a similar product by Clinique which works well but Nanoblur has a less intense smell and feels softer on my skin.</li>
    <li> I heard about this on Dr Oz (of course).  I couldn&#x27;t use it for very long because it caused my Rosacea to flare up.  I  gave it to a friend at work and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help her .</li>
    <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t know what I would do it they ever stopped making it. You have to apply it properly. Put a nickle size amount in the palm of your hand and PAT it over your foundation. Do not rub. Let it dry then finish with your powder or blush. It will stay put all day and give you a flawless finish</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works.  It&#x27;s weird.  People think I have great skin health all of a sudden, and I&#x27;m gonna let them continue to think that!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not gonna share this with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is pretty small though.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I love the product! It does what it promised to do! I got compliments after using the cream. Not sure I look 10 years younger but I definitely look better after using it :)</li>
    <li> This product delivers everything it promises.  My skin looks flawless when I wear it, albeit a little dry.  Surprisingly worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely  thrilled with the instant result using Indeed Nanoblur.  The bags under my eyes and discoloration DISAPPEARED!!!  I recommend this product without any reservation or hesitation.</li>
    <li> Nanoblur is definitely a product that does what it is supposed to do.  Just a dab of it is all that is needed on the areas that need the &amp;#34;attention&amp;#34;.  The key here is to not put too much on and when it is on, quickly smooth it out before it dries.  I also find that if you put it on before your foundation, you will get white dry flaky pieces on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a decent moisturizing foundation, then before the foundation is completely set, will put the Nanoblur on and gently, yet quickly smooth it in.  To the person that had a white face, you put on too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this product make you look 10 years younger?  Well i am 49 and I pass for early 40&#x27;s, so I would say that it knocks off a good 5 years, especially around the eyes.</li>
    <li> IT´S A GREAT ONE NIGHT OPTIC EFFECT</li>
    <li> Great quality. Thank you</li>
    <li> My first time to use it.  Am still learning proper application but can definitely see an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love Nanoblur. One of my friends who works at a TV station tired me on to it. All the on-air personalities use  it in order to look great on HDTV.</li>
    <li> not really what i thought it was...does not work well with my makeup</li>
    <li> Dont like at all..When I put it on my face I look like a dead person.. Makes my face very pale. I put it on twice and took it off right away.  Didnt like how my face looked.</li>
    <li> It is not a miracle product, but it works.  It provides a softer image.  I agree it works best when you pat it on.  You do not have to use a lot to get results.</li>
    <li> This product works well if used correctly, but can look like a complete mess very easily. After applying your foundation, rub a small amount between your fingers to make it a bit more fluid and then DAB (do not rub) the product over your foundation. Do not overwork it or you&#x27;ll end up with a stubborn glob of makeup that takes a palette knife to remove. If used correctly, it gives your foundation a matte finish and &amp;#34;blurs&amp;#34; your pores, making them much less noticeable. I find it lasts longer on areas that don&#x27;t tend to get oily throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last longer than four hours on my nose and chin, but if you don&#x27;t have combo skin, that may not be an issue for you.</li>
    <li> Really works....amazing</li>
    <li> Great product, it&#x27;s used on any scars or cuts on face and hands. I mainly use this product for hand modeling auditions and jobs. It makes your scars blend more into the skin. It&#x27;s great when you cover with a bit of foundation too. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This product is OK, but be careful when applying it. It gets clumpy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this product. It could be that it works better for some skin types than others.</li>
