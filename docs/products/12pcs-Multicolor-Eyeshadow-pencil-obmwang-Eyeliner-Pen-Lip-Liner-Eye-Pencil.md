<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered it before reading reviews read reviews after I received it. Now I&#x27;m afraid to try it. Did examine the brush it came with it sucks. My bottle doesn&#x27;t say MAC on it.</li>
    <li> The water proof Eye liner is water proof yes but it is not smudge proof.&lt;br /&gt;I Think the product applies very well the pigment is great but the only thing that i did not like was&lt;br /&gt;the fact that it smudged.Dose wash of with soap and water so that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;This product looks and goes on great but i would suggest that they make it smudge proof as well.&lt;br /&gt;Over all  looks good until it smears with minor improvements with it could be a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner and applicator that i have had in a while.  I WILL BUY IT AGAIN!</li>
    <li> worked pretty good, I don&#x27;t use eye liner too much, but it&#x27;s there if I need it.</li>
    <li> If anyone is interested in buying Avon products please use my website&lt;br /&gt;https://strandpink.avonrepresentative.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just joined yesterday to see how it is. I&#x27;m trying to find ways to earn money while being a stay at home mom&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this. The price was great and it lasts all day. Only problem was the shipping takes awhile- it&#x27;s definetly worth it, though.</li>
    <li> Bought this two times. Its super glidey and smooth. Easy to work with. Cheap. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Later but it&#x27;s a good product..</li>
    <li> Its soooo small. Thought it would be a little bigger but its so tiny.</li>
    <li> Only received two of the three ordered but product is good and although they a little bigger than a quarter in size, one will last a while. I recommend another brush though for applying. But definitely a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> The color of this shadow gel looks almost like regular eyeliner, except it is applied differently. Very reliable and sticks to your skin like glue.</li>
    <li> This is an okay product. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s water resistant and it&#x27;s smooth. When ordering, I didn&#x27;t realize that it was coming from overseas (didn&#x27;t pay much attention... my fault), otherwise I would have passed on ordering it. I am a bit weary when it comes to ordering things from overseas because they usually turn out to be totally the opposite of what is expected. Not in this case, I was gladly surprised by the item. Like I said, it&#x27;s smooth, dark and it&#x27;s water resistant. The brush that came with it is a bit crummy, I don&#x27;t recommend you using it. So, since it&#x27;s coming from overseas, you have time to go and buy an angled brush (if you don&#x27;t already have one). The bristles on the brush are a bit ruffled, mine didn&#x27;t come with the plastic bristle protector, so some of the bristles were bent. I don&#x27;t really care because I will be using my own brush, I was more curious on trying out the cream eyeliner. However, I did moisten the brush that it came with and it did an okay job, I still prefer the angled brush, though. I placed the order on April 1st and I received it today, April 15th. Expected delivery date was between April 27th &amp; May 13th. It got here sooner than expected. Oh, one more thing! The container does not have any kind of sticker/label, so, I really don&#x27;t know what the brand is or what&#x27;s in it. I&#x27;ve had it on for about 6 hours now and I seem to be okay. No allergies or anything. Overall, it&#x27;s a good little product... brush sucks.... Well, I hope this helped you... Good luck! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Not happy with product</li>
    <li> Love it will order again thanks</li>
    <li> Everything was great. The eyeliner and brush came in a small package and in time and it was fantastic. I&#x27;ve only ever used liquid and pencil eyeliner and I wanted to try gel. This gel eyeliner is the bomb. Its completely amazing. I love it. Only thing I have bad about it is that I don&#x27;t particularly like the brush. Some people like their brushes like that one is but I didn&#x27;t. I preferred a more stiff brush. So I took a paint brush I had and used that and it was splendid! :) Thanks!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the greatest gel liner I&#x27;ve ever used, but it gets the job done if you have your own brushes that are decent. The one that comes with it is not even a little bit okay. You get what you pay for, though. And I knowingly bought this for the price and use it when my higher end gels are running low. Sometimes mixing them together. Good product, but obviously not great.</li>
    <li> This product smears so bad!! Do not order!</li>
    <li> Amazing I love the gel but I&#x27;m not a big fan of the brush</li>
    <li> Very watery, does not seem to be warerproof.</li>
    <li> Got the liner in the jar but no brush to apply it like the photo shows.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really waterproof. It rubs off easily, and smudges.</li>
    <li> I tried this out, because I thought &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34; for the low price. Came here to confirm -- this eyeliner sucks. Really bad.</li>
    <li> It smudges a lot. By the end of the day you will have dark marks under your eye. Would be better use for play make-up for kids and for teens starting to use make-up. It also did not come with a protector over the brush like shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> great for brows. Brush is too large for this tiem.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, and I got even less! It&#x27;s oily, slimy, sheer, and slides EVERYWHERE! In order to use it I suggest setting it with black powder. It doesn&#x27;t work well with lashes or loose glitter.</li>
    <li> This seems to not want to dry and smudges...</li>
    <li> Really small size &amp; the brush kinda sucks</li>
    <li> This was an item I purchased for review and they are great little eyeliner compacts !  It glides on smoothly, not wet and definitely not dry like many are ... I love how small they are so they fit in one of those little pockets inside my purse and don&#x27;t get lost in the bottom.  Perfect for me !</li>
    <li> It works well but not with the brush. It runs down the eye over time.</li>
    <li> love this smooth gel liner. you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
    <li> Brushes were in pieces doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth $2 in my opinion. I am curious as to what the ingredients contain.</li>
    <li> Liquid liner is just fine. Just get yourself a new brush.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it a negative star. This doesn&#x27;t stay. It wears off within a couple hours. Never again will I buy this product</li>
    <li> For me, this product wasn&#x27;t the best..it smears too much and doesn&#x27;t last long, it also burned my eyes every time I wore it..</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes..I&#x27;m a make up artist and I have used many eyelashes in the past and by far these are the best!&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the price there well worth the money. Easy to apply and very natural and beautiful! I&#x27;ve also bought many other&lt;br /&gt;styles from these brand and been very happy too!</li>
    <li> Waste of money, poor Quality</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is ok not what I expected it&#x27;s just like the regular ones you can buy at the store and definitely NOT waterproof</li>
    <li> Bought it and it took forever to come. When i received it the gel was so hard I could not even use it. Threw it away. No point in returning it for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Hate the brush! But the gel its self is really nice. glides on easy and stays all day. I bought a cheap very little $1 concealer brush to replace the brush it came with. Im in love with the stuff and if you make a mistake while applying it a simple swipe with your finger erases it so that you can try again.</li>
    <li> SOOOOOOO AMAZING!!! GOES ON SUPER BLACK AND IT CAME WAY EARLIER THAN EXPECTED~!</li>
    <li> Having fun with this eye liner. Goes on great. Thank you</li>
    <li> Get what you pay for, smears everywhere  and on every thing</li>
    <li> Terrible. Just use some car grease.</li>
    <li> Not bad trimmed brush with scissors and works just fine. Isnt waterproof</li>
    <li> Great value and really nice brush to use as well goes on well and stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> I was actually really pleased with it. I love the way it looks on my skin and how it stays hydrated without flaking throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with this at all. The consistency is greasey and the lasting power is horrible</li>
    <li> This is great.. it works better then a pencil</li>
    <li> I believe this is just some kind of oil...it even smells like it. It never dried, so obviously it wasn&#x27;t water proof. It stayed oily and smeared till it was gone...a few minutes later that is. It also itched my top lashes. Not to the point of them falling out, but it was very irritated with in a few minutes. It took forever to get this off. It did smear as it was like an oil. I wouldn&#x27;t put this near my face let alone my eyes.</li>
    <li> This product is waterproof but it also smudges way too easily.  It goes on smoothly, if you have good brush to work with and looks good as long as you don&#x27;t let anything touch your face. If you don&#x27;t uncontentiously rub your eyes or absently touch your face you might be able to ware this well. I always end up looking like a raccoon when I wear it. My daughter likes this because she says it makes her look like Bill Joe Armstrong (from Green Day).</li>
    <li> Good deal for the product.</li>
    <li> Its okay smugges thoe</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not water proof it smears off with just a touch !!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic must order!</li>
    <li> Surprise this is a tiny little bottle of stay put gel liner. I have had the good fortune of working with some of the best cosmetics in the world but I am always on the look out for those secret products that give us that wow factor and this product did just that. It is not a big jar but as the saying goes a little bit goes a long way! I knew as I was ordering this that I would use my own brush so do take that in consideration when you buy this. I am not saying that the brush is horrible I just feel that when using a product like this, a precise product, you may want your own brush. I love the velvet like feeling of this Eye Liner and that is how it goes on, just like velvet! I think that brings us to the ease of use. I do not feel that the trend of the cat-eye look is going anywhere soon so if this is your intended use for this product it may take some practice. I find that true about any product you use for the cat-eye look though! Now if you are using this as a traditional eye-liner or water line liner then you are going to find it truly easy to use. It does stay on and I found it to stay put even during swimming. So to sum this product up: great water proof product, velvet like feel, fantastic in the water- line and it does a superb cat-eye ( with some practice). It is affordable but you may want to use your personal brush. Oh and a little goes a LONG way. I give this product and this seller an A++</li>
    <li> Brush is a little bad but it&#x27;s a good eyeliner</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for and I finally managed to get , easy to apply , durable in makeup ; it is also very comfortable to use because it brings fine brush to apply according to the taste of people. Fast delivery and in very good condition , would recommend.</li>
    <li> This works wonders!!! I am a big fan of the cat eye makeup look and the Waterproof Eye Liner + Brush Black works perfectly for that. The brush is small so i&#x27;m able to make fine or bold  lines depending on my desire. Giving it the swatch test -(test on hand) it is waterproof.  Overall i am very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> It does stay all day it last like three hour the most don&#x27;t think is really water prove</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner! Cheap and durable !</li>
    <li> Mine isn&#x27;t waterproof and I also need to get a different brush since mine started falling apart. It also smudges after wearing for a few hours. I do like how smooth it goes on.</li>
    <li> It is a little oily and the brush does not work.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry. stay wet and smudges very easily.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on. It wears off in MINTUES. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Would never buy it again. It didnt try so it got all over my face. I ruined the rest of my makeup and extremely hard to take off. I would never buy this again.</li>
    <li> It is economical but not as good quality</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this eyeliner. She said it goes on so nice and smooth and it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> The eyeliner was good the brush was horrible.</li>
    <li> i was a little disapointed because i thought it was water proof and it is not at all. but i guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> For the price its an amazing gel eyeliner.I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> The brush that comes with it sucks &amp; the makeup is cheap.</li>
    <li> Love this products last all day and night</li>
    <li> Smooth, stay&#x27;s in place . I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth stays on LONG! VERY Hard to smudge or wipe off once dry. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. And has a rich color. I don&#x27;t however like the brush that comes with it but that&#x27;s not a big deal just use a diff brush. Over all good product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to use, and stays on all day!</li>
    <li> Good quality.  These were a replacement for another brand that didn&#x27;t work well.  Like the results and will buy another when this finishes</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible eyeliner! It ran down my eyes and I ended up with a pool of black gunk! I looked like a raccoon!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Took awhile before recieving but it was worth the wait since it was so cheap.</li>
    <li> makes great lines . for the price works great.</li>
    <li> this product glided on my eyes and made my eyes looking good. its everything that i expected it would.</li>
    <li> First off, the brush that came with it was horrible.  It bent way to much to apply a straight line.  I then tried using my own eye liner brush that has very stiff bristles.  This helped but it has a very shiny appearance when applied and just isn&#x27;t right for me.  I typically go with a very smoky eye and this wouldn&#x27;t blend at all.  It is also almost impossible to take off.  I have pretty sensitive skin and my eyes were irritated by it towards the end of the night.</li>
    <li> Not very waterproof or long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;But good for waterline.</li>
    <li> Gel was dry and brush very flimsy</li>
    <li> It is okay for quick use. The quality is not good at all and brush is useless. Just pay alittle more and get something nicer.</li>
    <li> It was really thin eye liner like the gel wasn&#x27;t thick enough or dark.</li>
    <li> It was too thick to use on my eyes, so I gave my dog some chola eyebrows instead. He loves them!</li>
    <li> I hate it. You cannot apply it well at all. It just sucks.</li>
    <li> Love it will buy again only $1.66 !!!!!!</li>
    <li> The brush is not stiff enough to apply with precision. The product is definitely waterproof, but not smudge proof! It smears during the day and then you can&#x27;t wipe it off without remover. :(  But I love the application with a better brush, and it&#x27;s a great price for large groups like high school theater productions, which is why I really bought it.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time yesterday and I&#x27;m amaze by how pigmented this is. I love it. I will buy more in the future :)</li>
    <li> The brush it came with is horrible. It did not keep its shape at all.&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner itself does not last more than 1 hour. It disappears! It has 2 be reapplied to often thrughout the day.</li>
    <li> This new waterproof eye liner is a great buy for those people who love be able to line and shape your eyes different ways also you can add as much as you want with the applicator.I just love how its water proof and stays on . If you want a eye liner that wont fail and last this products for you . Buy some today.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner itself is great. But the brush it comes with isn&#x27;t. But for the price, zero complaints.</li>
    <li> Love this, very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the brush but yet I don&#x27;t use the brush that come with my blush but this is easy to work with n latest long I had one for 5 months n still full n get ready everyday with a lot of eyeliner used u get more then what it cost</li>
    <li> Brush isn&#x27;t so good...</li>
    <li> Havent tried yet but exceed expectations</li>
    <li> Love the eyeliner but hate the brush it&#x27;s not what was showing in the picture brush is too small an the brush hairs are falling off not even even!! I recommend buying a better brush separately!! But the eye make up is great!!</li>
    <li> Easily smears. The brush is horrible. It&#x27;s very stiff and straw like.</li>
    <li> I love the color however, it smudges very easily.</li>
    <li> put on in the morning, by lunch time I had to take it off! It was smudged all over my eyes -_- I looked like i had black eyes. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but do to the low price I am not surprised, the brush it comes with is not great but using my own brushes it goes on very well and looks awesome.</li>
    <li> Did not expect it to look like something you can buy from a little girls make-up kit. Brush was like a toy, not firm, and a joke! The eyeliner did work somewhat .....which is ok I guess.</li>
    <li> took about 15 days to come</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much because the price was so inexpensive. However I work two jobs as a cook by day and a server by night. The eyeliner stays on through both shifts and at the end of the day comes off easily. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Pretty small brush looks a little cheap but other than that its not bad for the price</li>
    <li> It messes up real bad after you apply it. Especially if your under the heat or sweating.</li>
    <li> Generally a cheap product, scared to know what it actually contains.</li>
    <li> I should start by saying I have never used the brush for this product or applied it by itself. I mixed this with my eyeliner and with my mascara (I bought the wrong colors as I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the labels). Anyway it darkened them to the colors I wanted, but this stuff is a little thicker than mascara and you kind of have to gouge it out. Overall it served the purpose for what I needed it for. Be aware that it may be kind of difficult to wash off soon after applying it.</li>
    <li> Comes off really easily -.-</li>
    <li> Just got this today! Came exactly on time, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this. Glides on easy, doesn&#x27;t smudge over the top of you eye and is actually dark enough! Yay. i definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I smears everywhere even with primer.</li>
    <li> You definitely get what you pay for. The brush is awful and just not useable, the eyeliner itself applies easily but does not dry and will without a doubt smudge, I applied it then talked to my mother for about 10 minutes,then when i came back and looked in the mirror it looked awful there was smudged eyeliner everywhere.. Even though its a great price it is not worth getting,it makes me sad because i was super excited about getting it but i will never be able to wear it. So save your money.</li>
    <li> Great liner. Could use a better brush</li>
    <li> The worst thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Didn&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> it saya water proof but not smudge proof and it smudges  it souldnt go no furter than the lid</li>
    <li> eye liner is of low quality. smudges easily. better off buying a drugstore brand.</li>
    <li> Still kinda smudges but it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
    <li> It was very very tiny. Sooooo small. The brush wouldn&#x27;t pick up the liner on it but fast delivery</li>
    <li> the bottle is tiny! however I am please with the product</li>
    <li> The product was ok but the brush that came with it looked used but the eyeliner was smooth on top and appeared ok.</li>
    <li> this doesn&#x27;t even work it comes off within one minute. its bull!!!</li>
    <li> This eye liner is smoother then the mac one i brought for 28$ I would definitely by this again. The only down fall it the brush you get with it. I would by a brush from somewhere else</li>
    <li> Such a great gel eye liner! Great price!! Brush isn&#x27;t that great...but hey the liner itself is amazing...and with that price....you can&#x27;t EXPECT everything to be amazing....but again don&#x27;t let it fool you the gel is great! I have like 6 other brands that I have purchased at Walgreens, Target, Sephora, and Ulta...none come close!! However a slight bit of patience is required...shipping does take quite a bit....arrived as promised...but still takes a bit. Totally worth the wait. It will feel like Christmas once it actually arrives!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother to order this. I had totally different expectations and boy was I ever disappointed. It was so small I almost threw it away. Never again for a product like this.</li>
    <li> Decent product. Wouldn&#x27;t order again. Brush was useless. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again only because there are plenty of drug store options that work better</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for....the little brush that comes with it is horrible. It&#x27;s like the brushes that comes with children&#x27;s lip gloss sets. I wouldn&#x27;t use it at all. The eyeliner itself is not gel, its more of a cheap hard cream. just like children&#x27;s cheap lip gloss. it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly at all and hard to spread. not at all waterproof.</li>
    <li> I received my product but it did not come with a brush like it said it did and I only use gel eyeliner but how do they expect someone to use the product of it does not come with a brush just saying</li>
    <li> Not a good buy at all it doesn&#x27;t go on well at all the brush pokes your eye and hurt really bad I recommend not buying this product and if u do don&#x27;t use the brush that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Product almost immediately starts irritating eye upon application. Although irritation goes away after a couple of minutes, if your not conscious of make-up you can rub your eyes and cause further prolonged irritation.  Product did ship in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Product is much smaller than anticipated and took over a month th get here</li>
    <li> product is good. its just that whoever sent in its package forgot the black stick so that i am able to apply the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Super nice liner!  :)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on very well</li>
    <li> Very pigmented, goes on smooth, I love it</li>
    <li> Another gift and she is happy with it.</li>
    <li> The brush was all crusty and the liner doesn&#x27;t even stay on</li>
    <li> Got it for my sister. She liked it!</li>
    <li> NOT Waterproof feels fake messes up easily 👎👎 horrible</li>
    <li> Lol i dont see how the tiny brush would work, came with the plástic off of brush.. The eyeliner is easy to glide just not the best quality nor the right brush for it ..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for eyeliner, you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> It is easy to apply with a different applicatior then what came with it. I tried the original brush and my eyes were a mess, but that could just be because Im not that great with eyeliner. But I got a different longer handled eyeliner brush at home that I used with it just yesterday and it was so easy and turned out great. It lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t come off easily and I like that. I would recommend it to anyone as long as they have a eyeliner brush of their own.</li>
    <li> Glides smoothly and easy to apply as well.</li>
    <li> I got 2 since it was such a low price. The brush that came with it wasn&#x27;t that great, so i used another one. It came on time, too. It looks very good once you put it on,but idkk about the waterproof part.</li>
    <li> This product was kinda good. I like the look of it but it smudges and the took it came with was atrocious. I had to go out and my the right kind of tool. But over all you get what you pay for. I would say this is good for a beginner who doesn&#x27;t know much about makeup</li>
    <li> the gel color very easy to apply it does last all day and it looks fab, I would suggest a smaller liner brush than the one it comes with but it works.</li>
    <li> Not Happy with how small it is</li>
    <li> This item was wax it left a black residue on everything that was hard to remove,would not recommend or repurchase.</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth however, it bleeds and gives me an black line in my eyeball crease.</li>
    <li> I can get the same thing at my local Dollar Store for a buck. The container/lid/brush are beyond cheaply made, and the liner runs very easily. Plus, six weeks shipping time is rediculous for something I can get down the street for less money.</li>
    <li> Very greasy. Doesnt dry, brush is garbage, took forever to get here.You get what you pay for though I guess :(</li>
    <li> I ordered two I only received one and the liner doesn&#x27;t dry at all! This is the most horrid thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased !</li>
    <li> Like it. But it came with no instructions.</li>
    <li> The actual gel is ok but the brush is way too thick for a nice application. I used my own liner brush to apply the product and it was ok. Not as good as some I already have though so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d repurchase this one.</li>
    <li> Not oily goes on smoothly</li>
    <li> Great product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Came earlier then expected! The gel liner was good but the brush wasn&#x27;t good</li>
    <li> Comes out practically clear</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> The applicator brush is way too soft and the bristles are too long. It&#x27;s impossible to get the gel eyeliner on that applicator and draw a solid line ... fortunately i have the applicator that came with my first purchase (from Rite Aid) and i can use it. the gel eyeline, itself, is great. this is not the fault of the seller, who was excellent and did everything right.</li>
    <li> smears easily; applies easily</li>
    <li> its too watery-like when u put it on it doesnt go on smooth at all and it smudges quite a bit i would just go to walmart and buy a liquid eyeliner that doesnt smudge and it is also not waterproof it comes off very easily with just the tiniest bit of water</li>
    <li> Want more. Do yall have more colors?</li>
    <li> My daughter likes this eyeliner, it&#x27;s easy to store and easy to put on. It doesn&#x27;t leave clumpy spots and hasn&#x27;t smeared so far. Although she doesn&#x27;t wear eyeliner much, she likes the color and wants more of them especially since she&#x27;s so picky when it comes to her makeup. I&#x27;m glad she likes and enjoys it.</li>
    <li> This shipped super fast and is really good quality. The only thing I would recommend is buying a brush with a finer tip. It is not waterproof but lasted throughout the day without touch up. It is one of those products that a little goes a long way and will last awhile. Love it and will order it again.</li>
    <li> Was kind of surprised by the size of the liner but I must say it works very well. I do use a different brush other than the one it comes with because I feel it applies better and I have better control of the brush and product. I would say the product does need to be reapplied during the day but nothing that I wouldn&#x27;t mind doing anyway. The color is what was expected and a nice black that I love to wear. You honestly couldn&#x27;t pass this product up for the nice low price.</li>
    <li> Was a great gift. But a little small.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t  wasn&#x27;t  waterproof</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice since it has arrived. It literally took almost 3 months before it arrived. I honestly forgot I ordered it by then. It smears easily.</li>
    <li> It was really small jar.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t get my waterproof eye liner shadow</li>
    <li> Work fine but I suggest buying new fine brush to apply because the one they give is worth 2 cents</li>
    <li> its creamy and easy to apply but doesnt dry and it moves if you dont seald it with eyeshadow. but its very cheap wich its cool</li>
    <li> Runs alot once it gets on your warm skin. Dont like at all!!!</li>
    <li> WONT BUY AGAIN SMEARS VERY OFTEN</li>
    <li> This is amazing it&#x27;s intensely black and is definitely waterproof. The brush sucks but that&#x27;s ok you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> easy to apply though product is not smudge resistant non the less smudge proof. will stay on when wet as long as you dont touch product like to dry your face which is quite impossible. still dark and pretty, though the brush that came with this product was a joke. It resembled a water color loose brush like you would find in a kids paint by number book.</li>
    <li> The pigment is pitch black and looks awesome but the color rubs off super easy. You get what you pay for and I wouldn&#x27;t personally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product. Although i am still getting used to the correct way to apply it is what i expected it to be and a great price.</li>
    <li> Not even waterproof, I went off the reviews and bad idea I guess you pay for what you get</li>
    <li> Arrived early which is always a plus.  Goes on easy and feels sulky not thick. The price was awesome I ordered two. I will be ordering more. Very black not grey or watery. I only had to apply it once and it lasted all day.</li>
    <li> Its ok i guess i rather have the liquid eyeliner instead of the gel</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! WORKS VERY WELL! I HAVE NEVER USED GEL EYELINER BEFORE SO ONCE I BOUGHT IT, I HAD LOW EXPECTATIONS, BUT NOW I WOULD NEVER GO BACK!! TRULY AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
    <li> Only got the brush and I broke when I try to use it with my other gel eyeliner</li>
    <li> Love it .. Not waterproof as it says it is but still really good easy to apply...</li>
    <li> its so good and i love it</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. The viewer that literally was very dramatic with her review really went overboard with it stating she should of kept it for scientific research....and also stated that it could be motor oil! C&#x27;mon.... Smh!!  Yes the brush is a bit off, but you can purchase (if you&#x27;re not a make-up user or artist) a brush at any drug store or online. In other news....the product is fabulous. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Got it today &amp; I love it. It works great.</li>
    <li> I have re-ordered a couple times in different colors.. Great Product for a great price.  Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all. Made my eyes itchy and red.</li>
    <li> It transfers easily, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s waterproof or not.</li>
    <li> Does not go on dark have to go back and keep reapplying it. The brush is pointless.</li>
    <li> Until it dries , this formula smudges everywhere . It is very smooth going on but you have to wait before applying mascara or you will have it everywhere. I will have to try other brushes with it . The brush that came with it is cheap and not slanted so didn&#x27;t work well for me. I just have other gel liners that preform better for me.</li>
    <li> Love it love it. I wear tons of eyeliner all the time, nd have for 30 years. This is my choice now. Very very black, creamy yes but not greasy or runny. So far I havent had smuge problems, but I doubt this would hold up to ruff use. Very glad I took a chance on this item!</li>
    <li> Eyeliner was dried up and chalky</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!!!</li>
    <li> My gf was happy with her product until her sister stole it lol.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done but u need u buy your own angled eyeliner brush.  The one it comes with is just a cheap paint brush.</li>
    <li> It smudges badly under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she didn&#x27;t like it that much because it smears after a while and makes your whole eyes black</li>
    <li> Although it is a smaller amount, it goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks now and Ive barly made a dent in it.</li>
    <li> Smooth to apply and nice finish</li>
    <li> This is not waterproof. I bought this and have tried it several times and every time it smeared and looked very cheap.  Not satisfied whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Okay I have it two stars because it did arrive earlier than expected. First off the brush is beyond cheaply made, it started falling apart just looking at it. The brush had no protection tip on it, and they were just put in a bubble packing bag. I know it was like $2.00, but I have spent less on better. I&#x27;m just going to stick with what I know. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Great for the price!  Brush isn&#x27;t anything special but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be.</li>
    <li> It smudges easily. Not the best.</li>
    <li> I like this product is ok.</li>
    <li> Its nice, really easy to apply, but its really messy. Through out the day it runs a lot, sometimes i put black eyeshadow on top of it and that kind of keeps it in place but not really.</li>
    <li> Very good product but prone to smudging and you have to buy a brush you can actually use to apply with skill</li>
    <li> This product was greasy and never dried, out smudged all over my face. Tried to return and still haven&#x27;t gotten any response from seller.</li>
    <li> Product does not dry and rubs off on upper eyelid.</li>
    <li> The brush didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Look nice and good quality</li>
    <li> Very hard to apply precisely</li>
    <li> The item was not what I went it. I didn&#x27;t even get the brush. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Nice product, but was missing the brush.</li>
    <li> Love this product all that it promised. It goes smooth and last a long time. the brush makes it so easy to apply on just the right spots and lets you get as creative as you want, go from everyday look to a night look with just one application.</li>
    <li> This little pot of liner is a great way to test the gel liner waters! It&#x27;s tiny and the price is right to give it a try. The color lasts a decent amount of time (2-3 hours without primer, 4-5 with) and is easy to apply with a proper brush. I did not use the included brush because it did not look up to the task, but I&#x27;m sure with a good cleaning first it would do well in a pinch. The black is dark and blends beautifully!</li>
    <li> As others have said, the brush that comes with it is horrible. I did receive this product in a timely manner, and had no shipping issues. I am not a big fan of eyeliner, but like the way it looks. I just can&#x27;t seem to get the hang of how/where to apply it for the best look. But for the price, I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. The color was as expected and went on fairly easy. However, on the two occasions I have worn it I ended up looking like a raccoon after a short while. It is summer, with very hot/humid temperatures. The product does not &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; after application and tends to run, smear and cake in creases, and most definitely was not waterproof.  I am middle aged and did not use alot of product, and was not trying to go for a dramatic look, just a thin line along the lid to make my eyes pop a little. Will not use again and the product was tossed after second attempt.</li>
    <li> Smudges off instantly. Small amount but reasonably priced for size. Nice brush.</li>
    <li> I actually really love this I was expecting poor quality but it&#x27;s very pigmented and goes on very bold and black. I&#x27;ll buy it again the brush. Not so much the hairs fall out and it&#x27;s just crap basically. Still gets the job done though ya know</li>
    <li> Eye liner is okay you will need to get another brush this one  is not a good quality, I did not pay much for this product!! I give  this two stars up.</li>
    <li> Smears everywhere just a gross sticky gunk</li>
    <li> brush that comes with it blows, i had to use my own... and it is tiny. Pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> The eye liner last all day. Pretty oil based. Tlits great quality for the chest price. Although is small. Basically the circumference of a quarter, n night of a centimeter. Its oil based. But higly pigmented. So a little goes a long way. The brush is pretty small as well. The length of a pinky.I cut the synthetic hairs of the brush to make it angle.&lt;br /&gt;Its packaging came in an clear plastic bag.  In a yellow envelope. From hong Kong. Came qicker then expected.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Very small container but it lasts a long time</li>
    <li> For what I payed this is a great oroduct!!! Only complaint is brush so I bought me new one was worth using this product stays on .one thing when removing use the eye remover or it will smear and it&#x27;s hard to take off without  it.</li>
    <li> This product is so creamy, but almost too creamy that it comes off almost immediately! The brush also broke around the second day! The bristled just popped in. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> U all know its fake Mac and it smudges</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price but I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this for the price. Tge gel was fine as for the brush mine fell apart as soin as I unwrapped the package hence the title oh whell (sigh)...</li>
    <li> The product said it is waterproof...but what can you expect from a one dollar thing,,,definetlly no waterproof at all,,,i apply it,,and it went all over my eyes,,,very bad thing,,,</li>
    <li> The Brush in the picture is not excetly what you would get. You would get a dinky little paint brush</li>
    <li> Not good! Cheap you get what you pay for. Makes your eyes water, and smears off if you so much as sneeze w/ it on. Its just a cheaply made product and its not worth the buy</li>
    <li> The brush was not good at all!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> I live in Florida  and it melted with the Florida  humidity.  Not buying  it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. For the price it&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
    <li> Shows up very nicely... You can do designs easier with this eyeliner...</li>
    <li> Teeny Tiny kit and the brush is okay but not great.</li>
    <li> brush could&#x27;ve been finer , but it does its job.</li>
    <li> I loved it loved it loved it price is good and also the way it applies to my eye if they&#x27;ve a long time I love it nothing bad to say I loved it</li>
    <li> Glides on like a dream.. then glides right off. Perfect for that smokey-smudged-been-dancing-for-six-hours look six minutes after applying.</li>
    <li> iit was a gift for a teenager</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would say this is waterproof. The brush that came w/ it sucked. I threw that away immediately. I use an angled brush from a set I bought here on amazon w/ it now. The gel liner seems to go on opaque in some areas of my eyes. The liner never seems to completely dry either. It tends to run from the top of my eyelid to the bottom in my inner corner. Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off onto my lid which I am very happy about. I just fix my inner corner w/ a q tip and resume my day. To solve the completely opaque problem, I just add more product to my brush and apply it again over the areas I want darker. Satisfied customer for the price</li>
    <li> Brush is small and not so great but eyeliner is nice but definitely not waterproof and it doesn&#x27;t last too long it smudges.</li>
    <li> Watery! The brush is very limp and unusable</li>
    <li> Small and cute. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really like it and it does stay on very good!</li>
    <li> very hard to controll ended up with black everywhere</li>
    <li> My eyes watered.  Will stick with name brand eye liner.</li>
    <li> it is 80 percent waterproof and its amazing...</li>
    <li> The brush fell apart. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Graet Eyeliner 😊. Nice Price N Came  Fast!</li>
    <li> I just love the shade of jet black this product is and it stays as dark as it needs to. I would deffinately buy more when it comes to that time. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great but the brush isn&#x27;t the best so I just use the brush I have</li>
    <li> it was k not to my liking but it depends on everyone</li>
    <li> container is smaller than anticipated.but great product</li>
    <li> The brush itself is okay, but not for fine lines like most would like. Smudge proof is a lie. It smudges so easily. Its the first &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;  eyeliner I have owned, but it isn&#x27;t that bad. It gets the job done but should definitely get a new brush.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! Long lasting all day! Very tough to remove but I like my makeup that way. I don&#x27;t use the brush that comes with it but the gel liner is great!</li>
    <li> Would order more items received it way before the expected date</li>
    <li> this is way too oily especially for people with oily skin and the brush that came with it was useless. I used this by applying it with a maybelline gel eyeliner brush and i worked well but smudged and rubbed off after applying. however i will still use it to fill in eyeliner gaps and things like that because it is well pigmented.</li>
    <li> Mine arrived earlier than I expected (overseas shipping). I noticed 2 things: the container is very small &amp; the brush is not suitable for applying gel eyeliner. This is almost more like a creme liner than gel. It&#x27;s very similar to elf creme black eyeliner. I sincerely hope the brush was synthetic but it would be useful as a lip brush. I used my own brush (elf studio bent eyeliner brush the 1 w the black handle that&#x27;s $3 IKR it costs 3x as much as this eyeliner!!) but the eyeliner itself is totally awesome. I wish that I knew which sellers had which liners being this is generic coz some major variations going on in the reviews like ppl R saying it&#x27;s either really good or really bad &amp; some having diff brushes or a fake MAC logo on it. Mine has no writing on it. And I can assure u for less than $2 it&#x27;s def not MAC no chance no way no how. What you do get is an awesome creme-like waterproof eyeliner w a brush u can use for a lip brush. Realistically this container though very small (I&#x27;ve seen a container like this, I own an Estée Lauder creme liner in this size so it&#x27;s not totally unheard of), but by the time I u se it up if it were bigger it would have dried out. Keep tightly capped when not in use. This surprisingly did not irritate my very sensitive allergy prone eyes &amp; mine seems pretty water/smudgeproof but I haven&#x27;t cried or gone swimming. For every day use this is gr8!! I did a gr8 cat eye feline flick w this using the elf bent brush. Very happy w my purchase! The ONLY thing that would make me not reorder would the shipping costs &amp; that it takes 3 weeks to arrive, also I&#x27;d want to only buy from the sellers I already did business with. This eyeliner is perfect! It&#x27;s inky black opaque not too matte but not greasy shiny. Can&#x27;t beat the price pointe.</li>
    <li> False advertisement, it is NOT waterproof, not even close! Doesn&#x27;t stay on longer than 10 minutes, literally.</li>
    <li> Not at all impressed. The applicator brush it comes with it not at all ideal for lining.</li>
    <li> Not water proof and burns ur eye / bulrry</li>
    <li> Like how the stiffness of the tip of brush is used to help the eyeliner be applied more evenly.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> this was a good product it worked good i did not like the brush that came with it it made the eyeliner smudge. But it went on better once i got a better brush. The liner lasted all day and did not smuge off its a good liner .</li>
    <li> Bad service , the eyeliner is okay the brush doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Amazing and came within 10 days of ordering</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, for the price the quality matched it. It would smear easily and wouldn&#x27;t stay on long. I would have to constantly check to see if the eyeliner smeared all over my face or if I would have to apply more. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Does not go on thick enough</li>
    <li> Does not go on smoothly. Real skippy.</li>
    <li> Smudges really easy applicator brush is useless thank god I have my own but other than that good</li>
    <li> It Took About 2 Or 3 Weeks To Arrive , Which Is Shorter Than The Estimated Delivery Quote I Was Given . Surprisingly When I Opened Package The Container Said MAC . I&#x27;m Not Sure If It&#x27;s Really MAC Or They Just Used The Label. It&#x27;s Just Like All The Other Gel Eye Liners. But It&#x27;s A Great Buy Compares To Buying It Anywhere Else.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! yup it makes me more beautiful!  This is what I wantedcto buy to walmart but I  didn&#x27;t find the best one like this. But now this is it! I can use this to my eyes and make me look more pretty on it! I tried it this morning and this is so awesome! This is only in a cute bottle but for sure I&#x27;ll use this for long period of time. And if I&#x27;ll be out of it I will surely order another one! This product is the best for gifts as well. And I will surely recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item with a great discount in exchange of my review.</li>
    <li> great price and i love the product long lasting as well</li>
    <li> Brush came broken and eyeliner too thick like tar</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this is motor oil.</li>
    <li> I love this eye liner !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last you have to keep putting it on but other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Good quality creamy eyeliner. It stayed on well after swimming for a couple of hours in the pool. I was surprised at how long lasting it is. It goes on smoothly for nice straight lines. I highly recommend this product for the summer time and you just can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
    <li> I love how soft and rich it is. It applies well with a small brush and stays all day. The only complaint I have is that the brush that came with it is way too cheap and small to use so I advise that you use another small brush of better quality.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much, considering the price, but this is a decent gel liner! Yeah, the brush sucks. It isn&#x27;t going to help you get a clean line. With a nice, small angled liner brush, you&#x27;re good. It isn&#x27;t totally waterproof, but darn near close. As long as you use primer &amp; let it set a few min., it will stay put 8hrs+ It&#x27;s totally worthwhile! will be ordering more, ASAP!</li>
    <li> at first i thought i loved this and i do the way it goes on hoe-w it looks every bit of this is perfect but how it wont stay on u wip it smears all over ur face im gonna give it a 4 cause i like itbut dont forget and touch ur eye  its waterproof it say so it dont have tell its not smudge proof</li>
    <li> i do NOT like this product AT ALL. It does not go on smoothly and it&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s an eyeliner just like all the other eyeliner you can buy they smudge and don&#x27;t go on smoothly as they claim</li>
    <li> Love it...and its MAC</li>
    <li> The eyeliner gel itself it&#x27;s ok, had to buy a new brush because the one it came with wasn&#x27;t firm enough.. Other than that,  great product.</li>
    <li> I Loved It . Love Love Love..... I don&#x27;t like the little brush it came with but I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Horrible product Just smudges on and doesn&#x27;t stay at all!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would with stand 115 degree weather. It did not last to the car.</li>
    <li> Mine was shipped the next day and delivered in 3 weeks. This product isn&#x27;t matte more velvet it has a slight sheer, but it&#x27;s not glossy. The brush is terrible but a real eyeliner brush. It is water resistent, if you run water on it it will resist it but if you rub it with water it comes off. It doesn&#x27;t dry so anytime of the day if uo rub it will come off or smudge. Just don&#x27;t rub it. Product was decent overall.</li>
    <li> While this product is waterproof, it does not apply easy and goes on very streaky. In order to get my desired look I had to apply this product three times while letting it air dry in between. Also this product did not come with the eyeliner brush as depicted.</li>
    <li> I like it, does what it should. Had to fix a few strands in the brush but that was no problem. Also tiny in person. But most people might already expect that, this is my first time buying gel eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Shipped so fast and a great product! So happy!!!!</li>
    <li> Best eye liner ever!!! Love it..watery eyes ,sweat whatever does not bleed. Love it</li>
    <li> love this gel it is the first time i have ever used them and i love it, the brush makes a great line, makes your eyes pop they look good and feels like you are not wearing any thing,</li>
    <li> Awful DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I was very unhappy with this product the eyeliner smudges to much and gets all over my eye lid</li>
    <li> The brush could be more precise. The liner does not stay on all evening, but it is easier to apply than the pen style like eyeliner. I will add an addendum when I have been able to use it more! :)</li>
    <li> Ok so like the brush that comes with the eyeliner is super cheap it was falling apart when I got it! Not only was the brush falling apart it was really limp it bends back and forth , while you are trying to use it !! It sucks big time!!</li>
    <li> It says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; which it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed so far with this eye liner.  It stays on and is water proof.  But if you touch it, it comes off.</li>
    <li> Everything went well with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice liner, but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
    <li> Soooo cheap. But gets the job done. NOT smudge proof AT ALLLLL !</li>
    <li> i dont know if it was affected by the cold weather during shipping but it just crackled when i dipped the brush in. it was not gel like at all. it was not usable.</li>
    <li> Hard are crap to get off and it just flakes off...  Made a mess in the tub.</li>
    <li> It is tiny, but fits the price. Not sure if it&#x27;s really MAC...but says MAC on the cover. Applied just to check it out, and looks good.</li>
    <li> I applied this to my eyes and it went on so well was super smooth. But later in the day my eyes were so itchy I was worried I was going to get an infection.</li>
    <li> Eye liner was solid by the time I got it and the brush looked inferior.</li>
    <li> It just came today . I love the texture and the convenience of the size. Compact size works well for me. A little goes a longway. Very nicely packaged. The turnaround time ... Was a bit frustrating , but, for the price and quality it was all good!</li>
    <li> I expected it to be better.</li>
    <li> very disappointed it burns my eyes and smears</li>
    <li> Def not waterproof until you try to wash it off your face. But dont cry w it on</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as great as I thought. Brush could have been better, but very good overall with the pricing</li>
    <li> Absolutely NOT waterproof. Never really seems to dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used gel liner until now!! Love it</li>
    <li> Arrived a melted mess!</li>
    <li> It has been easy to use. It was the first time I have used it. Going to buy more.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff in fact I ordered three more</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really waterproof  but still a good product,  it took a long time to arrive</li>
    <li> Great product, takes a little while to receive but totally worth it .</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used gel liners before this one so I wanted to start cheaper and get comfortable before moving up. This liner bleeds like crazy. By the end of the day I ended up with raccoon eyes. It was not a good look at all. I tried all of the tricks like setting it with eye shadow but it still bled. I gave up on this and purchased a different, well known gel liner and have not had any of these problems. I would not purchase again. Two starts instead of 1 because the color was really good and it went on smoothly. Product NOT waterproof!</li>
    <li> I loved this eyeliner, but the brush it comes with isn&#x27;t very useful. I used my own eyeliner brush. The eyeliner says it&#x27;s waterproof, but comes off by just rubbing it, even if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;dried&amp;#34; which it doesn&#x27;t really do. Not the best for all day wear, but if it&#x27;s only a few hours, it will do it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> The brush is flimsy and does not work, but the eyeliner is amazing. It came in perfect condition and stays n all day.</li>
    <li> The brush isn&#x27;t so great thats for 1, the gel eyeliner itself is fine but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this since its so cheap but if you are a starter then you should buy this so that you wouldn&#x27;t have to spend more on a better quality to start with</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good amount for $2. It does not dry very quick and when you try to take it off it smears everywhere, kind of like engine oil. If you want something that is going to make you look like a panda, this product is perfect for you!</li>
    <li> its goes away easy not really lasting</li>
    <li> it takes way too long to dry! it smears easily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for mine but I&#x27;ll give it a 4 stare review because from the reviews it looks like it&#x27;s just what I want. When I get it I&#x27;ll update my rating</li>
    <li> I have read that the texture of the eyeliner was oily, but it is not, it has the exact texture a gel eyeliner has to have. It&#x27;s not very big, but you just use a little bit each time, so it&#x27;ll last quite some time. The only &amp;#34;but&amp;#34; is that the brush is not awesome, it will do its work, but I would use another one. For the price, is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> This product is awful. Not only did it take over a month to be delivered, when I got it the container was broken. Also the brush that comes with it might as well be a paintbrush for water paint. No way to put eye liner on with that brush.</li>
    <li> took forever to receive item, but that&#x27;s expected.  Mac is the best. saved me tons of money on this item</li>
    <li> Horrible. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mac eyeliner it&#x27;s smooth and very dark . Be sure to get your own eyeliner brush this one not to good</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:b346117f8643142f736aeba2d534928c]]I&#x27;m not a fan of regular eyeliner pencils and decided to give this one a shot because the price was right up my alley, even though the reviews were only so-so. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the brush wasn&#x27;t that great - I had to buy a new one after the first use - but the eyeliner gel itself is pretty cool! It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts a long time, something I haven&#x27;t been able to find with all-in-one eyeliner pencils. I use this with [[ASIN:B00QDUX1UC false eyelashes]] when I go out at night and it works really, really well with them, haven&#x27;t had a problem yet! I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more when this little pot runs out.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00QDUX1UC False Eyelashes - 70 Pairs in 7 Different Styles Allows You to Select Your Look From Natural to Dramatic! + FREE Bonuses]]</li>
    <li> A bit cheap (consistency) for my taste but over all great color, smooth application and waterproof for sure. Brush is good for touch up but I recommend using ur elf or mac angle brush.</li>
    <li> Great liner; doesn&#x27;t smear and I like the container it comes in.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> thank you, great product.</li>
    <li> Merchant states this eyeliner is waterproof either I received a defective on or it&#x27;s not waterproof. None the less if your not crying or in the water it works just fine.</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail...I applied the eyeliner once an it goes on very wet - I am not sure how long it takes to dry, but you will need t be careful not to mess up your eye shadow application one this is applied.  It looks very good once it is on.</li>
    <li> Love this.  First time using this type eyeliner.  It goes in smooth and stays on.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I&#x27;ve tried the best and some not so expensive, thought I would try this eyeliner given the low price.  I love it, the brush is ideal for creating a defined line over the lid and under.  Strongly recommend</li>
    <li> Took a while to come but I love it</li>
    <li> Is super tiny, and the brush sucks and to top it off the gel smears everywhere, false advertising saying that is waterproof, well it sure AIN&#x27;T.. I can go to the swap meet and buy a gel eyeliner for a dollar and work way better</li>
    <li> is very small!! the bush is hard and makes it rough to apply. first time receiving a product I didn&#x27;t like. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> They are the best. Shipping takes time, but I love the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof...</li>
    <li> I didnt like it!! It didnt work at all.</li>
    <li> Seems ok just got it today and ant put it on my eyes yet but here the shipping a little bit but hey for the price</li>
    <li> The brush does suck but other than that this eyeliner is perfect</li>
    <li> I like the liner what I don&#x27;t like is the brush that came with it . It&#x27;s more Luke a lip brush the a eye liner brush</li>
    <li> This gel liner is amazing!! Definitely going to re-order!!</li>
    <li> Maybe waterproof but it&#x27;s not smudge proof!!!</li>
    <li> barely works with a really bad brush</li>
    <li> Eyeliner is great, creamy, not hard to remove, but  smudges easily if not dried.</li>
    <li> Took forever but great product</li>
    <li> I love this .....its easy to put on and looks great on</li>
    <li> I love this!! I need a new brush though it doesn&#x27;t last long.. But I will buy again, turns out great. Where can I get the same brush from?</li>
    <li> I hate this eyeliner the only thing I can probably say I liked is how black it is its not waterproof takes forever to dry and it smears everywhere I had it smug all over my had and face. The price is too good to b true by cheap and u get junk.</li>
    <li> i like it but need to update the brush..</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry and gave my eyes a raccoon look all day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the fact that they had a sticker on the top that was name brand MC, but peeled off very easily. That was a waste of time for the seller in my opinion. Product is okay.</li>
    <li> The price says everything. Did not expect to get something amazing, but the fact that it does not dry at all makes me feel extremely unsatisfied. Also, the only way I see it &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; is that it makes your eyes black even after you try to clean it... Plus, the sticker that says &amp;#34;MAC&amp;#34;... Seriously?</li>
    <li> Stays in place . Doesn&#x27;t smear at all.</li>
    <li> Ehh its all right I guess if you want a good cheap gel eyeliner buy ELFs version for 3 dollars its a mac dupe. But this product looks and feels cheap and honestly I only use it for face paint. you could use it with a better brush because the brush it comes with is useless. Its will do in a pinch and its not terrible but it will smudge.</li>
    <li> Just plain ol amazing best product for eyeliner I have had and I never did gel eyeliner. I will be buying this again soon</li>
    <li> If you have never used gel eyeliner, what are you doing with your life? Pencils are rough sometimes and liquid eyeliner is definitely evil not to mention it cracks. Gross. Gel eyeliner is really easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t crack. Some of them need to be set. The gel liner I got from Evergoods is great. LIKE. It&#x27;S AMAZING. I had to set it with shadow but it turned out really good. I do however recommend putting it on after applying lashes and not before (I made a mess). But it gives good coverage and it barely feels like it&#x27;s there. It&#x27;s not irritating to my eyes and I have super sensitive eyes when it comes to eyeliners. Shipping did take like two weeks but it told me that it would take about that long anyway so it came when I expected it too. I&#x27;m not complaining. Free Shipping is Free Shipping, am I right? All in all I HIGHLY recommend this product for the thrifty shopper. It&#x27;s incredible. Full makeup review with images here: http://tatsuusan.tumblr.com/post/110365855409/okay-so-i-promised-a-review-like-forever-ago-so</li>
    <li> My brush was broke when I got it, and every time I try to wear it, it makes my eyes swell up so I won&#x27;t be buying any more of that, thank u</li>
    <li> I guess it will take some time to get use to using this instead of the pencil, but other than that I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> It feels less like eyeliner and more like facepaint and the brush is not the best</li>
    <li> I like it it gos on easy and stays on...</li>
    <li> Really great customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Bad quality not complaining since it was a dollar but yeah it&#x27;s bad 👎</li>
    <li> Excellent sellers. I recommend 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neyeska.</li>
    <li> Bought this a couple of months ago&lt;br /&gt;Package and product came perfect&lt;br /&gt;Only and biggest problem&lt;br /&gt;It smears on your eyelid really easy and its super annoying</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!!!! Is creamy, easy to put on, and it lasts. I&#x27;m super happy with it.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t good at all. The product is in a small 2 in. container, the brush is extremely cheap (too soft and didn&#x27;t let me apply the eye liner), and not at all waterproof. It didn&#x27;t even have to be in the humid, get caught by tears, etc. It literally melted on its own. Not bad of the price but in the other hand, I got a much better waterproof eye liner at the dollar store.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps your decision</li>
    <li> the mascara is smaller than I expected, width is as little as my two fingers.&lt;br /&gt;the brush does not look good but does the job, you can buy a new one if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;and yes, it&#x27;s not waterproof but if you don&#x27;t touch it, it won&#x27;t smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my first time using gel liner, and i must admit that I like using this better than a pencil eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not mac, although the sticker says it is..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product but took a long time to get here</li>
    <li> Horrible eyeliner, its waxy and melts on your eye lids and lower lash area.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> Very considerate fast shipping product way above my expectations.  Will gladly order again.</li>
    <li> Great thank u great price fast shipping</li>
    <li> It seems to be okay. The brush is to big to get definite lines. It took over a month to arrive and the brush was a bit damaged. I haven&#x27;t used it much yet though. Overall for the price is was as much as I expected.</li>
    <li> I like the ease of use but its not waterproof</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all&lt;br /&gt;- bad quality&lt;br /&gt;- not on time&lt;br /&gt;- the brush to cheap&lt;br /&gt;- that&#x27;s not Mac</li>
    <li> Good color but the brush sucks.</li>
    <li> I AM VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT USING IT... IT HAS NOT GONE THROUGH ANY CUSTOMS OF ANY KIND HERE IN AMERICA, THE PACKAGE IT CAME IN SAY&#x27;S  [ PRODUCT UN--TRACKABLE] AND NO INGRIEDIENTS I WISH I WOULD HAVE NEVER ORDERED IT... VERY SCARY......DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT., YOU HAVE NO INFORMATION ON WHAT IS EXACTLY IN IT........</li>
    <li> Clean line just not waterproof like they said it ran into my clients eyes before a shoot I almost lost my job</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved it</li>
    <li> Too greasy.  it smears &amp; make you look like two black eyes.</li>
    <li> very happy and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this Eyeliner, Dark as expected,Not a fan that it smear every easily, Last all day with a few touch up through out the day.</li>
    <li> Good quality and arrived in an okay time frame.</li>
    <li> worst purchase of my life.. lmao is this what you call eyeliner? This smudges like crazy and its tiny and abnormal. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I love gel liner so I rushed  to order this product when I saw the price.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived after a bit of time, not that I needed it right away though.&lt;br /&gt;It did come with a brush, but I use my own eyeliner brush. I&#x27;m not very fond of the brush that it came with. The brush that I use has thinner bristles and is slanted, which makes it easier to use than the brush that came with.&lt;br /&gt;The color is nice and dark, the consistency is slightly wetter than what I&#x27;m used to when it comes to gel liners. I think this makes it smear easier, because it did tend to smear a little after having on for a few hours. I don&#x27;t like that very much. I end up having to reapply. I also got a little bit in one eye and yes it did irritate a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is ok if you apply very thinly so it won&#x27;t really have a chance to smear much. Worth the price, which like I said is pretty low.</li>
    <li> Not waterproof in any way but you get what you pay for. For a few hours it looks awesome. Works great with fake lashes.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with the product, smeared and sucked</li>
    <li> This is the best gel liner I have used.  Goes on jet black, it&#x27;s waterproof and dries fast. It&#x27;s also smug proof as well.  Excellent product and sooooooo cheap</li>
    <li> Although my order came a week late, I feel the product is very good for the price. The jar is small about the size of a quarter and but if used sparingly it could last for years. It doesn&#x27;t run much or smudge, it stays put for the most part and is highly pigmented. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Got MAC product! So awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Also, works amazing and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> the brush is cheap. If you buy a different brush the eye liner is ok.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is horrible! It is very runny and I couldn&#x27;t even leave the house with it on I had to redo my makeup because it kept going all over my eyelid!! DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> Another product I purchased for my daughter-in-law. She likes make-up and she said this was nice and did not irritate her skin. She went out to dinner and dancing with my son and had to reapply it once during the evening. She liked that it was small and fit in her bag but the brush came without a protective sleeve so she had to make sure that it was cleaned before she put it back in her evening bag.</li>
    <li> Trust me well worth your money, i would buy again it looks like a small container but I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and haven&#x27;t even gotten through a quarter of the container. You might have to apply it about twice a day but its amazing for the price. you might need a different more fine brush but other then that it is truly well worth your money and the long  shipping date. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok but the brush isn&#x27;t good at all</li>
    <li> Racoon eyes and somewhat difficult to remove even with specific mascara removing pads</li>
    <li> This is horrible DO NOT BUY. And it&#x27;s not a mac product. Would have given it 0 stars if it was possible</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof and does not stay on all day when it&#x27;s hot which I live in California so it&#x27;s always hot here but is it worth buying? Yeah if you just need a eyeliner and don&#x27;t care if it fades</li>
    <li> Mine did not even came with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Works like a pencil eyeliner, will give you the racoon eye effect after few hours.</li>
    <li> Wish I could give it 9 stars. I had racoon eyes in under an hour</li>
    <li> I received this item in about 6 weeks, ordered Jan  31, received Mar 14, so don&#x27;t order if you&#x27;re in a hurry.  As noted by other reviewers, it came with a really shoddy child like paint brush, not the one pictured above.  If you have your own brush, the actual product isn&#x27;t terrible, once applied it&#x27;s ok, although it doesn&#x27;t appear to actually be waterproof.  I cannot recommend this product heartily.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever had. Brush isn&#x27;t too big either. Took forever to get here but was worth the wait AND the price. Should last you over a month. About the time it takes for your second order to come in.</li>
    <li> It came early, shipped in 2 weeks when it said 4 weeks. It isn&#x27;t very dark, but you can layer it. It isn&#x27;t thick, veryyy thin consistency. Might seem gray and have to use many little strokes because a long stroke would not have any product on the brush left. It is kind of waterproof, it doesn&#x27;t wash off fully but might still run but not too much. The brush wasn&#x27;t protected when I got it.</li>
    <li> Felt like I was putting car oil on my face. Is nothing close to water proof...a waste of money. Lol whole $2.</li>
    <li> Definitely not waterproof. And the brush is very thick and difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I really loved the way it went on so smooth.  I plan on repurchasing this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> it didnt go on as smoothly as expected and the texture and thickness were not easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I love it great product</li>
    <li> Falsely advertised, it had a Mac sticker half on the lid crookedly, NOT embossed as is Mac&#x27;s style. The brush is too thick for an eyeliner brush. It looks like a kids paint brush. The eyeliner inside of the jar consistency is way too thick for eyeliner. It Also WASN&#x27;T Waterproof. IWant My MONEY BACK. It is very hard to see how to return it because I can&#x27;t read Chinese/Japanese. I need help so I can return this and get reimbursed.</li>
    <li> Does not dry and tends to smear.</li>
    <li> its so smooth yet greasy like cheapest Halloween substance of blk junk grease like film you can find! no gel@all! not worth a cent! I personally would like to submit misrepresentation and have my 2 dollars bck Mann! what a lie...and claims to be Mac, and is so much smaller than all the one&#x27;s you buy i&#x27;m just into the makeup! it can work for about an hr. long i&#x27;d say tho....fair? really unsatisfied :(</li>
    <li> the brush is stiff and flat so you have to apply it on the side of the brush but it works....a softer round brush would have been better but  for the price can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Not even close to being waterproof</li>
    <li> really good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no need to reapply</li>
    <li> Kind of a crappy product. Liked the brush tho.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner looks absolutely flawless its just the brush that messes everything up. order your own brush.</li>
    <li> The brush was horrid, so I need to buy a new one to replace it, but the color is exactly what I wanted, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Received product works better then I imagined</li>
    <li> meh.  I use a different brush because the one that came with it was useless. This product says waterproof but is far from it. I have major issues with it running just during the course of a normal day.  It only stays on for a few hours, tops.  Definitely not a good buy.</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes look better</li>
    <li> Alot smaller than I envisioned and the brush is really low quality. Not the product to choose if you&#x27;re planning to wear it all day or to a long event</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as waterproof as they claim but overall it&#x27;s a good eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t smudge at all and the brush is really soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like the color and the texture of it but I can&#x27;t stand the brush it came with and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> i wish it were a bit darker, but other than that its as described, oh and i didnt even try the brush it came with i just bought a little pink brush set for like $3.30 and it works really well</li>
    <li> Such a waste of money... after reading all the reviews of customers i ordered the product but believe me its a waste of money if it would have been send for Free then also i won&#x27;t recommend it to any one not only because of the cheap brush which is of not any use but also for the gel...its just a black color if you will use ,it will smudge the same time you will apply it on your eyes ether its not a waterproof or a smudge proof eyeliner !!!</li>
    <li> No waterproof i don&#x27;t liked ....</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;Eye Liner&amp;#34; is mor than just terrible, it stinks!  I am not sure what it is made of but, it is so weak that it smudges very easily.  After applying it (I am not a novice by any means) I had to fix my make up 5 times because it just kept smudging...it was all over...it just never seemed to dry or set at all.  I ended up having to go over this product with a different Gel Liner (Revlon)...which worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner was as expected but brush was poor quality.</li>
    <li> I loove the eyeliner works great! And the eyelashes most of them where smash and used so i couldnt use some of them its how they came  packed...</li>
    <li> Do not buy this it is not worth it !!! It&#x27;s not even dark enough nd it melts soo easy it&#x27;s  ridicoulous brush sucks just horrible</li>
    <li> When I got it I was thought it would have come a bit bigger but it was quarter sized. It smudges more than my regular eyeliner and fades more. The only thing I like about it is it&#x27;s a very dark and smooth to put on the brush is okay too.</li>
    <li> the brush sucks and its not as waterproof as they claim.</li>
    <li> I received it fast . but its small</li>
    <li> I got it today in the mail and I loved it!!! It&#x27;s amazing honestly.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews saying that the brush is no good but I actually was able to put it on and quite nicley might I add. It was easy. It&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> It was a lot smaller than i thought it would be. other than that it is pretty decent.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing</li>
    <li> it does the job, but is sort of watery...</li>
    <li> Not good quality at all. Brush is not helpful and the makeup is so oily and just not good for anything.</li>
    <li> its pretty good for the price</li>
    <li> Gel doesnt dry at all and keeps smearing and l dont have sensative skin but This product irritates my eyes....i regret</li>
    <li> wiped off way too easily and was basically grease.</li>
    <li> got it much fastrr thsn rdtimatrd nice surptis</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is exactly what I expected and am very happy with it! The only thing was I had to get a new brush. The bristles are off and didn&#x27;t make a clean line but other than that u can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> brush sucks! i order this because of the brush, i havent tried the eyeliner</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Even tho its a lil to small but its really nice..i will be buying move soon:)</li>
    <li> It says Mac on it, but it&#x27;s not made by Mac and it smears very easily. To the touch. I used it a few times and tossed it out.</li>
    <li> This was not at all what I thought I was purchasing, I do not want to ever buy makeup online again! :-(</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction and great product</li>
    <li> THIS is my favorite by far comes on nice and smooth. Excellent</li>
    <li> Alitttle runny for me.  Brush is not what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Its not dark eyeliner .. Really poor product</li>
    <li> Not really waterproof but goes on rather well</li>
    <li> It was perfect &amp;came in the mail so perfectly packed.</li>
    <li> It started to do this greasy separation. Brush is no good</li>
    <li> i like it but it didn&#x27;t include the brush.</li>
    <li> it is really great and stays on a long time. will be buying it again</li>
    <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT WORTH EVERY PENNY THANK U THANK U THANK U</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work! I tried to put it on and it wouldn&#x27;t even go on my eye!!! So I was very disappointed with it!!</li>
    <li> love this so much just a little disappointed with the brush it came with was hopeing for a more angled one</li>
    <li> love it but brush was not the best quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered this but i don&#x27;t really like it, because it doesn&#x27;t stay for day long  on the eyes.. needs to reset hour in hour :)</li>
    <li> love this product I bought an exspensive one for 10 bucks and that one dried up and was so hard to blend this is smooth and I also use this for my brows you might wanna invest in a good brush for application</li>
    <li> Good item came exactly as I had in mind</li>
    <li> works great for the p[rice.</li>
    <li> I saw this and tried this one out and it was perfect! It doesn&#x27;t smudge, and last for a very long time. I use this all the time ever since I got it! :)</li>
    <li> I ordered three. Came before expected delivery. Not broken or nothing missing. Very glad!</li>
    <li> Didint like the eye liner pencil or brush its not what I expected</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very slippery and has a fake mac logo</li>
    <li> This is definitely not my favorite eyeliner and brush combo but it is ok. Just hard to put on in a straight line.</li>
    <li> It never really dries so if you touch it it gets everywhere. It&#x27;s ok for face painting like if you want to make war stripes or something. or if you want to practice doing gel eyeliner without using a more expensive eyeliner</li>
    <li> Swipes on easily! Have never put on eye liner  that fast before and with it straight and beautiful!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Not waterproof! It smeared all over me after only having on for a few minutes</li>
    <li> it is so smooth, and also i have very sensitive eyes and other ones don&#x27;t work but this one&#x27;s color is so pigmented and bold. I love it.</li>
    <li> Smudged and runs down your face. Horrible.</li>
    <li> love this producted goes on so smooth</li>
    <li> Its a good product and shipping was on time but it slowly starts to smudge and fade.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t set, which really sucks</li>
    <li> fades after a while but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Just go out and get like Mabelline or something, because this is NOT water proof, this is not very good, it doesn&#x27;t dry, it doesn&#x27;t stay, when it does dry, it flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crappy product. Very very crappy.</li>
    <li> The shipping took only 2 months! The eyeliner smears and the stick is horrible. Not surprised for the lroce better off getting the brands at walmart amd walgreens for 8 bucks.</li>
    <li> Not super black or wet.</li>
    <li> I have used this multiple times now. For work &amp; going out. It smudges, fades, runs. Water proof Not really. Not my fav eyeliner!</li>
    <li> Wish this was a little more liguid than cream. Goes on well though. Very sexy.</li>
    <li> Such a small container, won&#x27;t last very long!</li>
    <li> Brush is awful. Luckily I have a few other liner brushes. but the liner itself is is pretty good. However it isn&#x27;t really waterproof.</li>
    <li> Loving this product,it just took so long to get here.</li>
    <li> nice black rich color, however takes forever to dry, so waterproof aspect down the drain. Forever to drive it so what</li>
    <li> Not water proof as it states it is, doesnt last long AT ALL,and rubs off easily.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money or time</li>
    <li> The brush was broken when I recieved the product</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price and I got it in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Not to happy. Very dry.</li>
    <li> Good price ok product</li>
    <li> Love this very satisfied I ordered another one</li>
    <li> i like it but takes too long to get to my house I ordered this almost a month ago!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like it, goes away really fast :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> You definitely get what you pay for. This is an okay product for beginners, but if you are advanced, you know you have put a black shadow on top of it, as it is too transparent on the skin. Smooth application though. And the brush it comes with is horrific, throw it away when you open it.</li>
    <li> NOT waterproof. And is really hard to apply.</li>
    <li> love it! Will buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product. NEEDS a different brush</li>
    <li> A little bit thicker than expected but still a good product.</li>
    <li> This is the worst eyeliner ever! Omg</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright I guess, wears off fast, but easy to apply</li>
    <li> Went on black, which is good. Rubs off way too easily though.</li>
    <li> i didnt like the eyeliner because i found myself applying it frequently it, it would smudge a lot specialy in the heat outside during the summer.</li>
    <li> I love, love the eyeliner itself, and the price of course but the brush isn&#x27;t too good,  def suggest buying or using a different eyeliner brush!</li>
    <li> It is not waterproof but it is very cream and does take a bit to dry. I like for the price it stay on a long time I set it with a bit of black eye shadow.</li>
    <li> Very running use with a primer, but you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I was going to get permanent eyeliner that cost $600 until this. This takes practice but looks awesome!</li>
    <li> I like the gel eyeliner. I just don&#x27;t like the little brush that comes with it. Its to cheap but you obviously get what you pay for. But its easy to use so I like it.</li>
    <li> After purchasing this eyeliner, i noticed that it states &amp;#34;Generic&amp;#34; but I figured I would try it just to see. I&#x27;m sure you can tell from the price that it&#x27;s not going to be greatest thing, but it&#x27;s not to bad actually. It stays on for about 5 hours, however,  it smears HORRIBLY! Within an hour of applying it will be smeared under your eye really bad &amp; sink into the creases under the eye if that makes sense. I would recommend saving your money though, unless your in dire need of some cheap eyeliner.</li>
    <li> perfect for a subtle eyeliner on the beach and in the pool.</li>
    <li> Not good at all I guess I got what I payed for. The brush came off the eyeliner is very thin n feels like it&#x27;s water based eyeliner...</li>
    <li> I used for the first time yesterday, it went on smoothly and I did use a different brush..also my shipping was pretty fast..it is definitely black..don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s water proof based on reviews but it worked for me</li>
    <li> It took along time to dry and smeared .. It was good after it dried</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is NOT waterproof, it rubs right off! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> Very black does not dry out so fast that it can&#x27;t be used on my eye brush. I love it. Fast shipping great price. Will buy again</li>
    <li> Came pretty fast which was good but I opened my eyeliner cap I found a dead little spider/tick looking thing in my cap by my brush! Not happy do not get this item!</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, the little brush it came with broke very early on(my own fault) so I bought some disposable lip gloss applicators that works perfectly.</li>
    <li> On time but product not t as do scribe</li>
    <li> i didnt use the brush since i read reviews that the brush doesnt work for them but the gel works quite well its pretty good!</li>
    <li> I love it...it so wonderful it&#x27;s make my eyes glow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to gel liner use. So I think as I attempt it more, I will like it. So for being new I think it works well.</li>
    <li> The shipping time was great and product was as promised, but this is by no means waterproof - at least not for me. If you have even slightly oily skin it will give you raccoon eyes in a matter of minutes. It goes on very smooth and I like the color but it won&#x27;t stay on at all. No problem with the seller - it was the product.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s cheap and good and the color is good but it wears off so fast and it&#x27;s so oily</li>
    <li> Its ok. Looks great when it goes in but then ends up on my upper eye if you don&#x27;t put some powder over top of it to set it.</li>
    <li> This product was awful when i went to use it all the cream just flaked into little pieces and i could not even use it, and i bout 6 of them and they all did the same.</li>
    <li> This goes on very easily,  however it smears terribly...all day.</li>
    <li> Came fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But smuges too much and doesn&#x27;t dry!</li>
    <li> IT CAUSES IRRITATION WHEN ACCIDENTALLY FALL INSIDE EYE BUT ALL EYELINERS DO BESIDES THAT ITS AWESOME</li>
    <li> gave it to my mom as a gift :)</li>
    <li> Not impressed at all. This was more grey than black and smudged super easy. I was cleaning around my eyes all day but I still looked like a raccoon!</li>
    <li> First off the bristles of the brush are too soft. The brush is more useful as a lipstick brush than an eyeliner brush. The gel eyeliner itself is not as thick, so it comes off easy, doesn&#x27;t last. The plus side, it glides on easily. For the price, it&#x27;s good. I gave it to my teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not smooth. When applied it gets lumpy! Don&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is the first of its kind i have ever used. I can apply it easily and it last all day. The brush allows me to apply either a thick line or a thin one. I recommend this if you are using this type of eye liner for the first time.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner itself isnt bad, isnt the best quality but for the price you cant expect a whole lot. But my main complaint is with the brushes. They are very poorly made. I can&#x27;t even make a straight line with them. The bristles are jagged and i even tried wetting themto make them stiff and straight but didnt work out. not very happy overall....</li>
    <li> I really do like the product. It&#x27;s easy to apply, but it IS NOT WATERPROOF...</li>
    <li> smudges to easy, brush is flimsy</li>
    <li> I found this about the same time I was looking for a drugstore gel liner but being broke it&#x27;s not easy to find one. There&#x27;s not a brand name to it but thats okay. It&#x27;s a deep deep dark black and really does stay on my eyes for the whole day. It&#x27;s very pigmented and comes out very dark. Only problem is that it&#x27;s kind of hard to take off even with waterproof eye makeup remover and it does crease in the beginning if you don&#x27;t apply a primer or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a brush which in my opinion sucks as an eyeliner brush but instead I use it as a lip brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product (either free or at a discounted price) in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.</li>
    <li> Needs a firmer brush.</li>
    <li> Waste of money . Poor quality ..container is the size of a nickel..The brush that it came with looks like a toy paintbrush ..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. For the price it works. Not that smooth but for the money it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I would just like to start off saying i have tried a whole lot of different eye liners. This one is</li>
    <li> The brush they give you is too thick for my liking. However, the eyeliner applies very well and is easy to control. However, no matter what I try the liner keeps smudging EVERY WHERE and I end up looking like I was crying.</li>
    <li> Vary well sucked.and not waterproof like i said.</li>
    <li> Bad quality. smears everywhere. Very messy</li>
    <li> Product not to my expectations.  Liner doesn&#x27;t go in well.  Guess that&#x27;s why so inexpensive</li>
    <li> The consistency of the product is not creamy but for the price is really good. You need to find a really nice and thin brush in order to apply it.</li>
    <li> Used a few times don&#x27;t really like it because it runs but u get what u pay for</li>
    <li> It is not easy to apply for me, maybe I need other kind of product but this one was not I was expected</li>
    <li> The product itself is pretty good, but unfortunately shipping took forever, the brush itself isn&#x27;t good quality and the product size is very small :/</li>
    <li> its smears :/ but still cool</li>
    <li> First, I was surprised arrived early.  The product said Waterproof, don&#x27;t believe it.  It&#x27;s not waterproof so it smash.  Oh well. what do you expect for that price? Never again.........</li>
    <li> I was worried about buying this online, but I love it. It lasts all day. It did stay on in the pool pretty well. It is very easy to apply and work awesome. I love it</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed with the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;ness of this product. I wore it one time and within 15 mins of application it was smudging off without me touching it. It was due to perspiration due to heat.</li>
    <li> Is not waterproof....:-(</li>
    <li> Does not dry on well leaving big smudges. Love the gel concept though</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t sent the brush but the eyeliner says Mac on it and it works good</li>
    <li> Received it earlier than expected which was a pro. Smaller than expected. The brush was messy and there were fibers sticking out. Overall it applies very well and it is waterproof like you can cry whilst wearing it and it won&#x27;t come off</li>
    <li> it smears and smudges all over my eyes... Not good... Imitation . I highly DONT recommend this &amp;#34;mac&amp;#34; eyeliner ... Save your money for something else... :(</li>
    <li> Super cheap. Loved the easy application on…I did not have any trouble with the brush (surprisingly)…totally NOT waterproof at all. Smudged very easily. Not a MAC makeup at alllll! I honestly think it&#x27;s like a face paint instead of an eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I only got one color which was black and a brush and that was it so where are the rest of the color im still waiting 4months later</li>
    <li> Definitely won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> it smears real easy it is not water proof at all.</li>
    <li> I love it a lot it&#x27;s not water proof but it&#x27;s sooo creamy the way it goes on it&#x27;s like painting with paint ❤️</li>
    <li> Got it today,it came in about two weeks. It did not come with the brush.It was also like black lip gloss, it was greasy I had to set it with black eyeshadow.But it was only a $1 so I didn&#x27;t expect much anyway.</li>
    <li> look exactly like the picture it cam within two month</li>
    <li> At first i didn&#x27;t receive anything inside my little jar but they resent it and it came with everything... the little brush they have isn&#x27;t much help, so i recommend to use a angle brush.</li>
    <li> does not stay on at all</li>
    <li> great product easy to use</li>
    <li> It looks good but  its not waterproof  after a while its all over ur eye messed up :/</li>
    <li> I would say the eyeliner does the job for the price I love and only wear cream eyeliner shipping came sooner the brush it came with sucked but all in all it does the job it smears at time but heck its only like $1.66 so I&#x27;m say I&#x27;ll buy again...</li>
    <li> This is trash... It&#x27;s not good... I wasted my money &amp; time... When you use there is smaude stains all over your eyes.. &amp; flows to your nose. Smh ... Not good periods</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this was an eyeliner I thought it was something else but I tried and well, it&#x27;s super black so I was able to use it for &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; purpose.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, only thing is the brush was cheap but I had another brush to use.</li>
    <li> Definitely not what it was advertised to be...... Very small</li>
    <li> The brush that comes with it came damaged.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner gel, but I think the brush is not good for this, it&#x27;s too soft, but love the eyeliner</li>
    <li> I love it ! I use it mainly on my bottom inner eye lid and it last ALL day. And when i do wear it on top with a little wing and all, it still works perfect, nice abs dark and gentle on my eyes. Yeah the brush isn&#x27;t all that good but i just got a shorter more firm one, but that&#x27;s not what i pay for, it&#x27;s for the eyeliner. It is kind of hard to take off in the shower, but hey i like that, it&#x27;s like water proof, just use make up remover and it comes right off!!! It&#x27;s small BUT will last forever!! LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> I love this product, its amazing, affordable, easy to apply brush works for me nicely.</li>
    <li> Not up to standard at all.  Feels very cheap.</li>
    <li> This came farely fast, eye line brush not like the on shown and the eyeliner itself smudges and is greasy.</li>
    <li> its great and stays on</li>
    <li> Great! All I have to say</li>
    <li> Very dark, but only after two or three coats. Goes on smooth, but has a strong odor till it dries.  Will Likely purchase again once I Run out.. which may be neverrr</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is nice &amp; smooth. I wasn&#x27;t worried about the brush because I already had one I like.</li>
    <li> This product isnt water proof.  It run down your eyes before u put it on good.</li>
    <li> Shipping was slow but it came from China and itis as described. Worth the wait but if your like me and use this all the time order more than one this way you wilk have a stock and still have saved a bundle on what stores charge $12+.</li>
    <li> Really great eyeliner. Stays on all day.. Only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t dry, so try not to rub your eyes.</li>
    <li> This is amazing if you use it correctly. I read all the reviews and figured why not try it because the price was so low. I did trim the brush down shorter after I had read the reviews. You do not need to push the brush down in very hard just gently on the top to get a small amount on the brush. Use gently across your eyelid. If you do get it on yourself it easily wipes off around the eye with a Q-tip or off your hands with soap and water. I read a lot of drama queen replies to this product and it is not as bad as they make it out to bid you just have to keep in mind that a lot of people are drama queens and attention seeking. This is a great product and a fantastic price</li>
    <li> loved it better than eye liner</li>
    <li> I loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> Love the liner. I use it daily, I&#x27;m only giving four because the brush was worthless. I have brushes so it wasn&#x27;t an issue- for those who don&#x27;t though buyer beware.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like kid makeup it smears and VERY cheap!!!!! I will probably just stick to buying my makeup at sephora!! Will be keeping this eyeliner for kids play or Halloween....</li>
    <li> When putting it on, it looks GREAT. BUT, it does NOT last the day. You have to keep reapplying it. The brush is nice, the eyeliner its self is nice. I love how it looks, but it just doesn&#x27;t last. You get what you pay for I guess..</li>
    <li> great eye liner just wish I would have found earlier stays on all day with out touching up all day long and the brush is amazing can make very fine lines or bolder will keep buying this item for years to come its by far the best eye liner I have found I have tried over 25 brands and they don&#x27;t work as great as this one does.</li>
    <li> TOO WATERY. Not waterproof at all. it smudges within MINUTES,</li>
    <li> Really tiny and it did tend to rub off and it was a mess</li>
    <li> Sticky and gross feeling and it refuses to dry so u get it everywhere</li>
    <li> U get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not TEAR-proof and hardly waterproof.  Still, I like the brush and kohl so it&#x27;s useable.</li>
    <li> Works great but the brush can be better</li>
    <li> i give it a 4 star because of the brush but i read other reviews so i knew what to expect, besides that i used my own brush and it glide on easy, i fell asleep by 1pm and woke up by 7pm and it was still on my eyes with no smudges, so for the price and product i liked it :)</li>
    <li> Definitely way smaller than I thought it would be and not a good eyeliner at all.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and last all day. Love this</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but very very pigmented. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY FOR THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This is the worst eyeliner I have ever tried. Granted, it is cheap and I should have known better. It took 5 weeks for delivery, to boot. I applied this to a cousin who was visiting and it smeared right off in seconds. although it claims to be waterproof it is far from it.  I wouldn&#x27;t take it if it were free. Oh, the brush was, a joke.</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;m happy with it.. I would recommend &amp; most definitely buy again!... And its a GREAT price :)</li>
    <li> smeared every-time i used it i tossed it</li>
