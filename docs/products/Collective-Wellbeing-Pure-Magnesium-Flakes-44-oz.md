<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use to make Magnesium Oil to rub onto your skin!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff a lot. it is very pure, clean and works.</li>
    <li> great condition, was pleased</li>
    <li> I actually woke up and felt refreshed! That NEVER happens. I was in a good mood, and alert. That never happens either. Add in some energy, and I&#x27;m one happy customer! I use it at night as well as in the morning. The effect it&#x27;s had on me is simply incredible. Try it.</li>
    <li> Using this to mix magnesium oil. Going to be a long while before I go through the entire bottle! :)</li>
    <li> Highly recommended does the job in the least amount of time and use.</li>
    <li> great item, fast service</li>
    <li> I made magnesium oil lotion with it.  It melted wonderfully and blended with the oils great. Its just rather expensive if you were following directions and using 2 cups in the bath.</li>
    <li> First time using pure magnesium, but used in a body butter.  Seems to be potent and soothing when used on sore muscles.</li>
    <li> This product is awsome!! It litterally takes my pain away. I make it into Magnesium oil, and I spray it where it hurts.</li>
    <li> makes for such a nice, relaxing bath.</li>
    <li> Dissolves easily. Bought this to increase my magnesium and read this is the most optimal way for absorption.</li>
    <li> Recently bought to make some lotion. I think it&#x27;ll be perfect, but it was poorly shipped. The lid fell off and most of the flakes were loose in the box. I was able to salvage most, but still kinda frustrating.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s relaxing and definitely helps with muscle soreness</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Make my own magnesium oil with it.</li>
    <li> Working pretty well as making it into an &#x27;oil&#x27; to use on my kiddos to help them sleep.</li>
    <li> make my own magnesium oil with these flakes</li>
    <li> Dissolves easily in warm water. Cheaper than prepared mag oils</li>
    <li> Mixes very well-melts easily.</li>
    <li> Great value to make you&#x27;re own oil, cleared up my wife&#x27;s acne in 3 weeks, and we have tried everything.</li>
    <li> Great for baths! And MagAHol.:)</li>
    <li> I love these magnesium flakes, I combine them with my powdered MSM in distilled water to make some mean magnesium oil! Im always on the go and need my muscles to be top notch.Get better sleep too! 3/11/15 Update: I was looking to repurchase from this vendor, unfortunately had to order from someone else because this vendor upped the price by almost $8!!! I initally purchased for $13.85. I understand clearly the concept of supply and demand but not when i can find the EXACT same brand and size for $8 less. Epic fail on their part, you just lost one.</li>
    <li> After looking for a magnesium supplement and realizing that I just couldn&#x27;t swallow another pill, my daughter suggested spraying magnesium oil onto my body. I order this, made the oil by dissolving 1/2 Cup of flakes in 1/2 cup of boiling water. This has alleviated most of my severe leg cramps, but best of all, after reading some other reviews, I began spraying it on my toothbrush on top of my toothpaste. My last dental checkup caused the dentist to ask exactly what I had done, how I did it and where did I get it...It was that good. No plaque, no scraping and the easiest best checkup ever in my whole life. I had been using it for about 2 months before the appointment. I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> My doc said to take B vites and magnesium to handle the sensitive burning skin of my feet.  I was taking them orally, including the magnesium.  This combo helped somewhat, but until I began soaking the feet in this stuff every couple of days, the burning never really stopped.  Now it has and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m strolling over hot coals every day!  These feet now comprise an example of collective well being!</li>
    <li> amazing and good price.</li>
    <li> Love it. It leaves the skip clean and radiant.</li>
    <li> I boil this 1 cup to 1 cup with filtered water to make magnesium oil.  Let it cool in the pan then transfer to a glass spray bottle.  If you spray a little on your heels before bed at night it will get you moving!!!</li>
    <li> I am using these flakes as a bath tub soak for my legs.  I have metastatic cancer in my bones and I&#x27;m hoping to use this to elevate some pain in my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Posting as Michele Hogsett</li>
    <li> Received the day they said I would. Made my own magnesium lotion with this product.  Worked great for the application that I wanted and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Very relaxing in a tub.  I made oil from suggestions by other viewers.  Have used it for dandruff and it really works!!!  Better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> These flakes are ok for foot bath or shower. They don&#x27;t make a very good mag oil and should not be used in that way. I have read that all flakes contain impurities and are only good for lower concentration applications. They are one of the better values in mag flakes though imo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly why this works, but a 30 minute soak before bed makes my girlfriend and I sleep deeply and soundly. It also helps somewhat with our bum ski knees. We&#x27;re using one cup of this with one cup of Epson salts in a roughy 10 gallons of water so your mileage may vary - and this is the best price per pound at this quality level.</li>
    <li> It was ok. It didn&#x27;t work as I expected</li>
    <li> Better then epsom salts!</li>
    <li> I use for transdermal application in bath as well as spraying it on from my homemade magnesium oil. The results are amazing. Thanx</li>
    <li> These are very good quality magnesium for the price. It&#x27;s not quite as potent as other brands, but you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I was looking for some magnesium and this is the way to go!  Great price, for a great product!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hold my rating against it. I am still tinkering with the right strength and &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; of making mag oil. I have a lot of dietary restrictions which leave me low in magnesium and with my existing GI issues I felt transdermal was the way to go. I shall keep trying and hope I find my happy balance and can find the relief I am looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I am desperately needing more now so I will send a new order in soon.  I make my own spray and I feel it is helping me get my magnesium levels back up to par!!!</li>
    <li> Make my own mag oil and creams.  I supply my entire family (not necessarily voluntarily).  Hubby swears by it for eliminating his restless leg problems at night.  I use it on my arthritic hands and knees.  Daughter rubs a dab of the cream into each of her kids&#x27; feet to help them settle at bedtime.  LOVE.</li>
    <li> All the liquid version we tested came with a plastic smell. This product was clean of that and prices reasonably as well.&lt;br /&gt;We use it alot for massaging the aching muscles of our clients.&lt;br /&gt;Chen&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I received the package on time. I started using this product and I love it. My mom is using it as we&#x27;ll and is having great success. It is making a huge difference for her. Lots of physical improvements.</li>
    <li> I use it as body deodorant.</li>
    <li> I MUST get more of this!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Am making magnesium cream for what ails me which is much, this brand works perfectly for it.  I have low magnesium and the cream really works!</li>
    <li> Amazing .. It worked for me. I had restless leg syndrome RLS with no sleep while pregnant. I took bath every night just before sleeping and slept so well.</li>
    <li> Bought it to make magnesium oil because taking magnesium by mouth causes problems- it works, but it&#x27;s &#x27;oily&#x27; and sticky and I don&#x27;t really like using it- but it does what it&#x27;s suppoed to- I get leg cramps easily, and magnesium helps relieve cramps, especially after hiking- If I take mag right after, I will usually avoid the cramps- and I&#x27;ve noticed that using the oil seems to, at this point, help to avoid cramps as well as taking a pill of mag-</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this salt a few times. You go through it fast. I make a deodorant with it by dissolving 1/2 cup flakes with 1/3 cup water (makes a magnesium oil). Also super relaxing in the bath with a couple drops of lavender essential oil.</li>
    <li> I buy magnesium flakes in bulk and then use a 1:1 ratio (1 cup water + 1 cup flakes) to make my magnesium oil. This is a very frugal choice. Magnesium oil on its own is very pricey, it is cheaper to buy the flakes and DIY. I use magnesium for many purposes. I rinse my mouth with magnesium oil, I use it in my dread locks, I also rub the magnesium oil onto my sore muscles. I am also really into using magnesium flakes in my baths and foot soaks. Magnesium is a vital mineral that our bodies need to help regulate the nervous system. It can be absorbed topically as well as orally.  This product is so good for you. Everyone is deficient in magnesium, I Highly suggest you give it a try.</li>
    <li> Good price, and lasts for a long time! Good for restless legs, itchy ears, dry skin and long lazy baths. I usually use the flakes to make my own magnesium oil so I can easily dilute it to avoid the &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;.  Works as well for me as other more expensive flakes that I&#x27;ve bought.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I found out that I can make my own magnesium oil instead of buying expensive ready mixed oil. 1 kilo to 1 gallon of water! A great deal!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Great price....44 oz will last me awhile!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product to help with muscle cramps after working out, as an added bonus it has helped greatly with menstrual cramps as well!  I use two handfuls in a bath, once a week.  No more cramps!</li>
    <li> product arrived quickly,placed 1/2 cup  flakes and a cup of water to make an oil. I sprayed it on my arms and it stung a bit,had to wash it off but left a few irritated spots on one of my arms as if I am allergic to it. Think I may have to figure out what ratio would work best. After washing off I did notice my skin felt very smooth except for those few irritated spots.Will continue to work with it til I get it right, have read so many great reviews so it must be something im not doing right.No problems with the seller at all.</li>
    <li> I used this to make some magnesium lotion. It melts down nicely for beauty products.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my own magnesium oil, but ended up liking it for soaking as well. I have arthritis (since I was a small child) in my knees and this stuff has been a miracle worker for my pain! For intense pain I use it in the tub for soaking, but for frequent pain management, I just spray on some of the oil I made after using a heating pad and massage it in. I just recently ran out of the flakes so I&#x27;ll be ordering some more very soon!</li>
    <li> Its wonderful and I love how clean and pure it is.  Only 4 stars because dang, its expensive.</li>
    <li> Best value and works great!</li>
    <li> High Quality product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Mixed it with water and put it in a spray bottle.  I use it before bed and it has helped my Restless Leg Syndrome tremendously!  The magnesium supplement pills worked, but they were hard on my stomach.  Great stuff, would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Bought this because sulfur makes me very sick. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great product, use it in the bath, and for making Magnesium oil with distilled water for Muscle pain.</li>
    <li> I use these flakes to make my own magnesium oil and this price can&#x27;t be beat. I will continue buying.</li>
    <li> Great product, but horrilbe 2 day shipping...got it a week after I ordered it :(</li>
    <li> I use it in a bath tub, and it helps me relax for few hours...., but not much affect on my morning joint pain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought magnesium oil before and found it to be very beneficial to massage into my skin, especially where I deal with lymphedema and circulation type of issues.  I was running low and needed to buy more when I learned that I could make my own.  The Pure Magnesium flakes is magnesium chloride which is perfect for making magnesium \\&quot;oil\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s as simple as taking a tablespoon of magnesium flakes, enough distilled water to fully dissolve the flakes and a pinch of sea salt. Then I just massage it in anywhere I need extra magnesium.  The benefit of absorbing magnesium vs consuming magnesium - absorbed magnesium bypasses the digestive system to help avoid loose bowel issues common when consuming a high dose of magnesium.  It is well documented in the scientific literature the vast majority of us across the planet are deficient or insufficient in magnesium.  We found this mineral, plus vitamin D, along with some other trace minerals and alpha lipoic acid was instrumental in CURING my husband of his former 18 year long battle with Type 2 Diabetes (it&#x27;s often misnamed, very often it is really a basic metabolic dysfunction due to nutrient deficiencies.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great place to learn more about these issues includes: [[ASIN:0974858110 Hell&#x27;s Kitchen: Causes, Prevention and Cure of Obesity, Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome]] and [[ASIN:034549458X The Magnesium Miracle (Revised and Updated 2014 Edition)]] as well as [[ASIN:1591202914 The Sinatra Solution: Metabolic Cardiology]].</li>
    <li> Dissolves well for making magnesium oil.</li>
    <li> I took a hot bath with this and felt so totally relaxed and had the best nights sleep.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my daughter sleep a littly easier, she is soaking her feet anyway so we thought we would try it. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference between this and regular epsom salts.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on a recommendation for making magnesium oil.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a good price. You can feel the magnesium energizing you. It&#x27;s also less than half the price of a competing brand. That made me skeptical yet I don&#x27;t know what else the other brand could be offering as the Magnesium flakes come from the same place.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I used it to make magnesium oil which has been incredibly helpful with muscle tension, quality of sleep and anxiety reduction.</li>
    <li> The Magnesium Chloride flakes from the underground Zechstein seabeds are far and above epsom salts in their ability to relieve pain and spasm,  They even help for muscle spasms caused by your statin drugs (although you might want to consider giving those up based on a study review by the Cochrane Group unless you have already had a heart attack- cholesterol is a marker for inflammation, not a cause of heart disease, but I digress,)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a fraction of the cost of the well-promoted brands, even undercutting Swanson&#x27;s, although the container is less attractive if that matters. The salts can be made into magnesium oil (actually a brine) by adding hot water although I do suggest getting a spray bottle of magnesium oil for days when you don&#x27;t have time to soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost all of us are deficient in magnesium due to the loss of the mineral in industrial agriculture.  Between the mid-1970s and 1990s it declined by a third in food according to USDA studies, and who-knows since  then? It is used in hundreds of reactions in the body including those that process blood sugar or build bone.  Magnesium is likely more important than calcium in making bone and it is important to the nervous system.  Transdermal magnesium is often more effective than oral supplements which tend not to be greatly bioavailable.  So soak or spray it on.</li>
    <li> Better than Epsom salts for aches and pains.</li>
    <li> This works well for making magnesium oil.  It is a good product and the price was right.  I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This works wonders for stress!</li>
    <li> The product- magnesium flakes are very good. Only problem was that the bottle was opened and some of the flakes were spilled into the box when I received it in the mail. Better packaging and I would have given a higher review. Overall good.</li>
    <li> Thank you, this is wonderful for baths, works like a dream to relieve menstrual cramps or sore muscles</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the outcome of this purchase.  It was packaged well and arrived on time as promised.  We have been using the flakes in a footbath as well as making our own magnesium oil.  The product has been pure and we&#x27;ve had no problems with it.  I will be ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product and it arrived right on time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Makes great magnesium oil!</li>
    <li> I used this product to make Magnesium Oil and spray my body with it each morning and evening.  My sleep is AMAZING now that I use this.  I fall asleep quickly and if I need to use the bathroom in the night, I fall back to sleep afterwards very quickly.  I don&#x27;t think I could manage without this stuff!  Also, the leg cramps and restless legs are a thing of the past.  Make your own Magnesium Oil by mixing 1 cup boiling water with one cup magnesium flakes, mix, and let cool.  Put the cooled liquid into a spray bottle and spray your body about 10 sprays before bed.  You should see a huge change in the quality of your sleep.</li>
    <li> Very good and very pure magnesium flakes. They dissolve very quickly in the bathwater and really make me feel terrific, de-stressed, and relaxed. The next day a feeling of well-being occurs as does a lack of body aches and pains. This usually lasts for 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I used these to make Magnesium oil, so far so good!</li>
    <li> Read a ton of good reviews but did not seem to do anything for my grandson or myself. Said spray a mix of water and flakes and spray on bottom of feet to help relax and sleep seen no improvement. Put in bath water every night for a week must take a long time to see results. Not going to repurchase taking a magnesium supplement and that is works great for a lot of things only been taking a week and feel great. Think this product is just not for me since everyone is different.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my mineral bathes.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good service.</li>
    <li> I use this product to make magnesium oil.  Much cheaper than buying the ready-made oil.  I use a large 4 cup measuring cup and heat 2 cups of water to almost boiling, mix in 2 cups of the magnesium flakes.  Allow to cool until clear.  Dampen a washcloth with the oil and apply the cloth to arms or legs for a few minutes.  Store the rest of the oil in a glass jar, reheat and reapply as needed.  I made the mistake of spraying the oil on and it got on the floor!  Very slippery!  Once it dries, it&#x27;s not oily and cleans up easily.  I am chronically low on magnesium and develop cramps and bone pain when I forget to use it.  It works quickly when I  do use it.</li>
    <li> Saw a post on Facebook for a Magnesium spray recipe. I ordered this and liked how it&#x27;s packaged as you only need a small amount for the spray. I&#x27;ve been using it weekly now and am sleeping better!</li>
    <li> Huge jar. Using it to make magnesium oil. Very economical.</li>
    <li> Relieved restless legs for my wife</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. The benefits are amazing.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do what they said will do I used the entire jar and it didn&#x27;t help one bit to alleviated my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Came quickly.  Bought this to make my own Magnesium oil.  I just mix equal amounts of distilled water and flakes shake to mix and spray.  Works on our aches and pains great.</li>
    <li> Its a good product but a little pricey.  Its good for a bath soak and magnesium oil.</li>
    <li> This is a great value!  I suffer from Fibromyalgia and have found that soaking in this product reduces my pain and is very relaxing.  Buying a similar product locally is extremely expensive and I can&#x27;t come close to the amount I get by buying this product.  Completely worth buying if you suffer from any type of pain!!</li>
    <li> I did some research, and found that you can make your own magnesium oil for a lot less than buying it already made up.  I spray this on after a shower, and it works great.  It does feel a little weird and leaves a salty residue on whatever it comes in contact with (your hands, the floor, etc) so I spray it while still standing in the tub, then wash my hands.  It did sting a little, so I added more water than what it originally called for when mixing up the recipe. I think I used about 2 T per c of water. some people leave it on for 15  minutes, then wash it off if it is too irritating, but I did not want to have to get dressed, then go back and undress, rinse, dry off, get dressed again - too much of a hassle.</li>
    <li> I used it to brush my teeth and restore enamel and it really worked. My teeth were not as sensitive anymore after my dental cleaning. Would buy this again soon.</li>
    <li> This is one of those must-have products. If you&#x27;ve done the research on magnesium, you already know how essential it is to good, everyday health, and also how it is best absorbed through the skin. Sprinkle some of this in your bath and soak in the benefits. Knowledge changes over time but right now the research also indicates that these flakes of magnesium are better absorbed than your typical Epsom salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the price. This tub is always cheaper at your local grocery store, if they carry it. It is a little hard to find locally, which is why we order it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  I&#x27;ve been buying magnesium chloride flakes for about a year and a half now and have had great results.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any difference between this and other more expensive brands of magnesium chloride flakes because they come from the exact same place, the ancient Zechstein seabed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this primarily to make my own magnesium oil.  It&#x27;s not really an oil, but it feels like it.  I just mix either 50/50 with warmed distilled water by weight, not volume to make a 1:1 ratio or mix 2 parts flakes to 1 part warmed distilled water for a 2:1 ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who has never used magnesium oil, they may want to start at the lower dilution as it may sting.  Just spray a little extra water on your skin if it does and rub it in, it should take the sting away.  If not, then use less or use a lower dilution.</li>
    <li> I used these magnesium flakes to make a magnesium lotion.  I apply it every night, and sleep so soundly!  When I skip it, I can tell, especially if it&#x27;s a few days in a row - I sleep lighter, wake more often, and it takes me longer to fall asleep.  I feel so much more rested in the morning when I&#x27;ve used my magnesium lotion!</li>
    <li> Have found these flakes perfect for homemade mag oil. Will purchase again when needed</li>
    <li> This is great for soothing baths and making your own magnesium &#x27;oil&#x27;.  It helps relax muscles and relieve tension after a workout or shoveling snow - which we&#x27;ve done a LOT of lately!</li>
    <li> This is great for health it is more effective for me to get my magnesium, better than a pill and no stomach discomfort. It is very relaxing. I just wish the bottle told you how much to use.</li>
    <li> I use this when I have a bad fibromyalgia flare up day. It helps a lot. After a soak in the bath with this the pain is much more manageable.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s greT for taking a bath.  Came quickly.</li>
    <li> Great Item-Great Seller</li>
    <li> I have been using epsom salts, baking soda and lavender essential oil in my biweekly baths for almost a year-Its a great way to relax, detox, restore your skin&#x27;s ph and makes me sleep like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this kind of magnesium, hearing it was more potent and readily absorbed into the body-&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the flakes not dissolving quickly enough...&lt;br /&gt;I can tell its much more effective as I am more relaxed than usual and have noticeably more energy the following morning. I seriously have done many lifestyle changes that could have added to my overall boost in health and energy-but I know how integral magnesium is to processing all my other healthy improvements.&lt;br /&gt; I wish I had gotten my magnesium levels checked so I could state a before and after... I also rub Life flo brand magnesium oil on my skin daily.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this magnesium to make my own oil and lotions to maximize my total absorption&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased this several times now and intend to continue using it as I don&#x27;t want to lack sufficient magnesium in my body.&lt;br /&gt;Great product., I definitely recommend it and especially suggest pregnant women use more magnesium products topically. Its one of the main things I have added since my first pregnancy and I can&#x27;t tell you how great I feel at 5 months pregnant-or how fast my morning sickness disappeared after I began its use a month in.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with coconut oil. This is a great value, so grab some if you need some.</li>
    <li> I used these to make magnesium oil. They were priced right, and did the job.</li>
    <li> This is a VERY inexpensive way to get Magnesium into your system. I use this to make Magnesium oil (super-saturated MgCl), and for enhancing the flavor of my R/O water by adding a few flakes to a bottle/glass. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Wonderful to take a warm bath with these magnesium flakes. The flakes dissolve well in warm water and the magnesium relaxes your muscles.</li>
    <li> Lovely, thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of Magnesium, wonderful for soaking in the bath. Lessens all the aches and pains and relaxes me. My skin is so smooth after a bath soak using this product.</li>
    <li> I make my own magnesium lotion with this.  Works great!</li>
    <li> works great.... Have bought many times and will buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great to use in bath!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! Bigger then I thought</li>
    <li> I use this for back pain.  The way I do it is to dissolve it  and put it in a sprayer bottle and then spray it on the painful area.  It doesn&#x27;t do a lot for the actual nerve pain but it really helps with the muscle spasm that tend to happen due to the nerve pain.  I also love to use this as a bath soak.  Very relaxing, especially before bedtime.</li>
    <li> I love magnesium - supplementation with magnesium has helped me feel more energized and has reduced my headaches. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Made my own oil.  Used a lot of flakes and a little water.  Works great on pain issues and insomnia.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves this! He sprays himself with it as soon as he&#x27;s done showering. So many health benefits!</li>
    <li> so calming. So good for the muscles and for the spirit. Will order it again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  No problems.</li>
    <li> For my wife…she made Magnesium oil out of these with distilled water, and then again with organic vodka.  The flakes absorb equally well in both mediums. She said the vodka muscle rub was better absorbed through the skin. Magnesium oil is rubbed on the body to relieve aches and pains.</li>
    <li> We have just recently learn about magnesium and how we are all lacking in it.  Started using it and what a difference, if you have pain try it,migraines, arthritis the list is to long.  Do the research and try it out,you&#x27;ll be amazed.  Also my husband was able to find different formulas for the magnesium flakes for the different uses.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and at a good price!  Good size - will last for a while.</li>
    <li> great product great price, we all can use magnesium baths. would definitely buy this product again. try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it in a foot soak and it gives me the magnesium my body needs. Will purchase again as it came very quickly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Made magnesium oil and makes for a great additive daily!</li>
    <li> got this to make magnesium oil at home, I havnt started yet but great price and great seller</li>
    <li> Just used it once so far.  Very relaxing.  Magnesium is so important, and most of us are deficient, so I love the idea of taking a Magnesium Bath.</li>
    <li> I use this to make magnesium lotion and put in baths. Will continue to purchase this brand of magnesium flakes. Glad it is prime.</li>
    <li> I keep purchasing over and over!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Came in a timely fashion.  Really does feel like oil when sprayed on the skin. Helps with sleep. Good stuff.</li>
