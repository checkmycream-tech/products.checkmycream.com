      <li>I works really good.</li>

      <li>The kit is awesome and it is well worth.</li>
      <li>I was provided this product in exchange of a fair and honest review.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The trimmer comes packaged in a nice, leather-like travel case that also included tweezers, a comb, a lint brush along with finger and toenail clippers.  </li>
      <li>The case itself is nice.</li>
      <li>It is very cheaply made and is a wonder it lasted for</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s advertised as being able to do all kinds of trimming.  </li>
      <li>My husband is pleased with the product.  </li>
      <li>Thank you in advance:)</li>
      <li>I would give it a star if the light worked!</li>

      <li>My husband really is enjoying it.  </li>
      <li>My wife and I love this product.</li>
      <li>Overall the pouch is nice and great for travel.  </li>
      <li>Makes it easy to toss into an overnight bag or suitcase.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The rest of the items (comb, travel toothbrush, tweezers) are too cheaply made to offer any degree of functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The light still comes on, but the motor no longer operates.  </li>
      <li>Nice idea, did not work very well</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a snap to trim eyebrows and mustache with two available trim sizes.  </li>
      <li>I opened it and the light didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Some are really good; others are less effective.</li>
      <li>Piece of junk,Monroe on first use and wasn&#x27;t able to switch.  </li>
      <li>Does not work as good as the commercial,  But works</li>
      <li>cheap does not work right and tear up to quick.</li>
      <li>Piece of junk, lasted us about 1 whole minute of use and then the motor started to malfunction, not exaggerating, it&#x27;s cheaply built...</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work properly right out of the package.</li>
      <li>Fell apart right out of the package.  </li>
      <li>I’ve had one for years and it still works very, very well.</li>
      <li>and I do not want anything aggressive or a higher speed lest I hurt him.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nowhere near as functional as the original one that I had.</li>
      <li>It has a couple of useful items – the lint remover is decent as are the nail clippers.</li>
      <li>Both myself and my husband tried this product (which was given in exchange for review), neither of us had any real complaints with it.  </li>
      <li>this is much more than  I expected.  </li>
      <li>My husband really likes it.</li>
      <li>Cheap and only lasted a couple of months.</li>
      <li>These are only marginally acceptable for hair trimming and the light never worked.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well with nose hairs as other products.</li>
      <li>A classic piece of made in China garbage.</li>
      <li>Instead spend a few more bucks and get a wahl.  </li>
      <li>Fell apart right away, and in the meantime, did not get a close enough shave to shave any part of your body.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just looking for something to eliminate that bit of blonde peach fuzz from my cheeks, and more importantly when my husband is on chemo and too sick to have a hair cut - this works fine for me to use on hair in ears and</li>
      <li>Works great - except for nose trimming; a bit awkward</li>
      <li>It worked, however the light did not work, it is only good for small jobs, not good for beards.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do as well as my old one.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace my old micro touch.  </li>
      <li>It deserved this rating because the light didn&#x27;t work and the blade was dull and pulling out the hairs within one hour, other than this it worked fine.</li>
      <li>D not waste your money on this item.  </li>
      <li>Definitely had to order a new one!</li>
      <li>Even with a fresh battery the blade speed would vacillate up and down even when it was not being used to trim hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works as advertised and I was surprised it only used</li>
      <li>I actually went back to my old one.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this in the past from various sellers and have had some good ones and some poor ones.</li>

    <li> D not waste your money on this item.  Instead spend a few more bucks and get a wahl.  I bouth this item and it literally came all to pieces before I could get a good snipping.</li>
    <li> Nice idea, did not work very well</li>
    <li> Piece of junk,Monroe on first use and wasn&#x27;t able to switch.  A classic piece of made in China garbage.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Super happy with this trimmer!</li>
    <li> Was looking for something to manage nose hair and trim eyebrow hair sisors were not doing it. But this is just the thing. Works great. I was hesitant to get something &amp;#34;as seen on late night TV&amp;#34; but this actually works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Does not work as good as the commercial,  But works</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s already broken. Won&#x27;t turn on. Not worth the money to ship back.</li>
    <li> cheap does not work right and tear up to quick. I purchase two</li>
    <li> These are only marginally acceptable for hair trimming and the light never worked.</li>
    <li> Battery included did not work... low quality</li>
    <li> Worthless piece of crap.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I received it and it didn&#x27;t work,I tried several battery changes but it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The trimmer stopped working after a few months of occasional use.  The light still comes on, but the motor no longer operates.  It is very cheaply made and is a wonder it lasted for the dozen or so uses it did.  I&#x27;d look elsewhere if you want a product that will last.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Cannot even use it. Is cracked and a non working device!&lt;br /&gt; It is useless! Does not work on all levels. I want my money back frankly BUT don&#x27;t know how to go about getting it.&lt;br /&gt; Please assist!!! Thank you in advance:)</li>
    <li> piece of crap, fell apart and on off switch wont work, dont waste ur money</li>
    <li> My wife and I love this product. It is great for eyebrows, neck, arms ect.</li>
    <li> product arrived broken and is made very poorly.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do as well as my old one.</li>
    <li> Both myself and my husband tried this product (which was given in exchange for review), neither of us had any real complaints with it.  He uses it for trimming his sideburns and to keep his goatee from bushing out.  Me, I used it for shaping my eyebrows and removing my devil&#x27;s bridge.  It works as advertised and I was surprised it only used a single AA battery - two were supplied with the set.  Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer comes packaged in a nice, leather-like travel case that also included tweezers, a comb, a lint brush along with finger and toenail clippers.  Makes it easy to toss into an overnight bag or suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried a variety of different trimmers over the years, this ranks up there with the best of them.  Add in the travel pack and you just really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of trimmers. Some are really good; others are less effective. But I never had one that was as painful and useless as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is shaped like a tube trimmer, but the cutting area is a traditional set of teeth rather than tubes. The cutting ability is minimal. In fact, you can’t even say that it cuts hair – it sort of tries to gnaw through it. The result is messy and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is horrible. The housing is cheap and thin; the on/off switch is very fragile; the battery compartment had misaligned contacts. Even with a fresh battery the blade speed would vacillate up and down even when it was not being used to trim hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only saving grace, to a small degree, is the accessory kit. It has a couple of useful items – the lint remover is decent as are the nail clippers. The case itself is nice. The rest of the items (comb, travel toothbrush, tweezers) are too cheaply made to offer any degree of functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good tube trimmer check out the Philips Norelco NT9130. I’ve had one for years and it still works very, very well. This trimmer, in contrast, is useless. Avoid!&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Cheap and only lasted a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Good product.  My husband is pleased with the product.  I&#x27;ve used it to trim his neck.  Works well</li>
    <li> Bu en pro duc  to re co men da do fe li ci ta cio mes SA lu do s</li>
    <li> this is much more than  I expected.  it&#x27;s a snap to trim eyebrows and mustache with two available trim sizes.  don&#x27;t know how I did without it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nowhere near as functional as the original one that I had.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have enough power with the battery.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk, lasted us about 1 whole minute of use and then the motor started to malfunction, not exaggerating, it&#x27;s cheaply built...STAY AWAY. I&#x27;ve purchased various brands of these over the years and this thing was the worst of all of them.</li>
    <li> great to have especially to clean your ears</li>
    <li> Fell apart right away, and in the meantime, did not get a close enough shave to shave any part of your body.</li>
    <li> Works great! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Product keeps stopping after 3 minutes of use.</li>
    <li> works real great, love it</li>
    <li> RPM&#x27;s are too slow. pinches hair because blade moves too slow.</li>
    <li> Piece of junk. Didn&#x27;t work properly right out of the package. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Works great - except for nose trimming; a bit awkward</li>
    <li> convenient,does the job</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk.  Fell apart right out of the package.  DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband really likes it.</li>
    <li> It deserved this rating because the light didn&#x27;t work and the blade was dull and pulling out the hairs within one hour, other than this it worked fine. You get what you pay for. David H Clapp</li>
    <li> This comes with lot of accessories. The hair trimming kit is good - I use it for nose and ear hair. I don&#x27;t use it to trim hair - barber it is! The kit is awesome and it is well worth. Couple of nail clips, combs, and other accessories. Coupld of AAA batteries included. Overall the pouch is nice and great for travel.  I was provided this product in exchange of a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this in the past from various sellers and have had some good ones and some poor ones. This was a good one.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old micro touch.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good.  I actually went back to my old one.</li>
    <li> This is our second Micro Touch,.  I&#x27;m just looking for something to eliminate that bit of blonde peach fuzz from my cheeks, and more importantly when my husband is on chemo and too sick to have a hair cut - this works fine for me to use on hair in ears and the spots he misses when shaving, especially on throat area.  It gets the job done and I do not want anything aggressive or a higher speed lest I hurt him.  We think it is very good value.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s advertised as being able to do all kinds of trimming.  It&#x27;s okay, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well with nose hairs as other products.</li>
    <li> It worked, however the light did not work, it is only good for small jobs, not good for beards.</li>
    <li> You know that PENNY you found on the ground? Save it- junk</li>
    <li> My husband really is enjoying it.  I works really good.</li>
    <li> I opened it and the light didn&#x27;t work. The machine quality is very poor. I tried to trim from my hand and it didn&#x27;t cut. It&#x27;s a very bad product.Not recommended. It&#x27;s not worth the money. I would give it a star if the light worked!</li>
    <li> We had one and it got dropped and broke! Definitely had to order a new one!</li>
