      <li>My daughter wanted this item for Christmas, the first shipment contained both bottles leaking from the top pumps!  </li>
      <li>The lotion is very light, kind of runny, not a heavy Vaseline-style, and non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>I am a HUGE advocate for anything organic.</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic</li>
      <li>This hand and body lotion is fantastic.</li>
      <li>It feels very silky-smooth and nice.  </li>
      <li>Great alternative to getting moisture back to the skin, instead of creamy lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to have Dr. Bronner&#x27;s as an occasional lotion.</li>
      <li>Fragrance of peppermint is appealing since I love peppermint  Price reasonable.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This has so many positive reviews out there that I wish it would worked for me</li>
      <li>I really hoped to love this lotion, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
      <li>I bought this at a local food store and had high hopes for it because of the great reviews here.  </li>
      <li>This has a gellous feel and fresh, peppermint smell.  </li>
      <li>I especially like the fact that if I use it on my hands and then prepare food that no nasty chemicals will end up in the food.</li>
      <li>I starting using &amp;#34;Just Natural&amp;#34; brands - much better.</li>
      <li>Pros: love the ingredients except one, especially since they are organic.  </li>
      <li>(my first scent choice)</li>
      <li>Needless to say, he was very happy on Christmas morning this year!</li>
      <li>I looked on many website and could only find the 8 oz size.</li>
      <li>After the first use, I noticed a difference in the softness of my skin.  </li>
      <li>First, it does anything but moisturize your skin in fact, it seems to make my hands more DRY.</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
      <li>, the main is reason is</li>
      <li>is very strong, I&#x27;m not sure if it is the alcohol or the peppermint</li>
      <li>It takes only very little to cover your hands, which is great because the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>My wife really likes it too, especially since it smooths my hands</li>
      <li>I use to purchase directly from the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>Second, the peppermint is so overpowering that it&#x27;s too much to apply anywhere on my skin.</li>
      <li>Very oily, doesn&#x27;t hydrate skin for long.</li>
      <li>Again, I very much like the peppermint fragrance which is relatively long lasting.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also concerned that so much alcohol could dry my skin out instead of moisturzing.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, the peppermint fragrance is refreshing but not overwhelming, and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Recently, I decided to change my chemical based garbage for something all natural -</li>
      <li>It is completely organic and I use it as a total moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Lastly, the lotion is no more than a greasy oil, something that should be used to clean the floors.</li>

<li> The peppermint smell is light, I was skeptical at first, but it&#x27;s not a strong smell.  </li>
<li> Initially the lotion seemed very moisturizing but, similar to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Lip Balm, it seemed to be less moisturizing and maybe a little drying.  </li>
<li> He tends to get dry skin on his forehead during the winter months and then after sunburns in the summer.</li>
<li> Do you have dry skin even after you put lotion on.</li>
<li> (note some dry skin is an allergy).</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it apparently has A LOT of alcohol in it.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s there as a preservative, but the alcohol smell overwhelms the peppermint smell, which is a little disappointing.  </li>
<li> There is absolutely no greasy feel.  </li>
<li> I had a difficult time finding it online anywhere, but finally found it on Amazon with new branding on the front.</li>
<li> my skin a little dry (don&#x27;t know</li>
<li> /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take a little bit of dry skin (use coconut oil to supplement) for the quality of ingredients and smell!</li>
<li> Cons: Do not love the ethanol which is extremely drying, organic or not.  </li>
<li> As a man, my hands get dried out pretty bad from work, really split bad sometimes, and this stuff brings them back to life.  </li>
<li> If you have never used Dr Bronner&#x27;s, you are missing out.  </li>
<li> Also, when it arrived, the lotion had leaked out of both bottles for some reason and made a small mess in the sealed plastic bag.  </li>
<li> Its a little thin</li>
<li> I was extremely disappointing in this product and I am stunned that it has an average of 4/5...</li>
<li> that&#x27;s very hard to find, but if it does not accomplish the purpose of what it was made for, then what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I use thid brand of bodywash daily and I love the peppermint smell.  My order was two bottles, so I took one to work with me and whenever I wear it I recieve so many compliments on the fragrance and how relaxing it is. I love that it has oil in it, so the scent lasts longer without having an alcohol smell.</li>
    <li> My husband grew up with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s All in One soap and the fragrance of it brings him back to the days of his childhood in Oregon. I stumbled upon a gift pack of the Peppermint scent last Christmas that contained a bar of soap, a pump bottle of the liquid soap, and a pump bottle of this lotion. He had never tried the lotion before and instantly loved it. He tends to get dry skin on his forehead during the winter months and then after sunburns in the summer. This stuff goes on well and soothes without being greasy. Plus...it&#x27;s his favorite scent. I had a difficult time finding it online anywhere, but finally found it on Amazon with new branding on the front. Needless to say, he was very happy on Christmas morning this year!</li>
    <li> Very oily, doesn&#x27;t hydrate skin for long. Pleasant smell and tingling sensation.</li>
    <li> I started buying Dr. Bonner&#x27;s castile soap products back in the 80&#x27;s at my local co-op. Later, when diagnosed with cancer, I made an extra effort to buy bath and body products that were additive-free and I&#x27;ve stuck with Dr. Bonner&#x27;s products ever since. This hand and body lotion is fantastic. It absorbs quickly, the peppermint fragrance is refreshing but not overwhelming, and a small amount goes a long way. I&#x27;d also recommend the bar soaps, liquid soap (which can be used for all sorts of cleaning tasks) and the lip balm.</li>
    <li> Pros: love the ingredients except one, especially since they are organic.  Texture is good, do not find greasy.  Fragrance of peppermint is appealing since I love peppermint  Price reasonable.  Cons: Do not love the ethanol which is extremely drying, organic or not.  Container is a #1 Pete which contains chemicals that leach into the product.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect lotion with a perfect scent.  There is absolutely no greasy feel.  Hydrates the skin perfectly using all natural, all organic ingredients.  After the first use, I noticed a difference in the softness of my skin.  I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE advocate for anything organic. Recently, I decided to change my chemical based garbage for something all natural - this lotion was a mistake. First, it does anything but moisturize your skin in fact, it seems to make my hands more DRY. Second, the peppermint is so overpowering that it&#x27;s too much to apply anywhere on my skin. Lastly, the lotion is no more than a greasy oil, something that should be used to clean the floors. I was extremely disappointing in this product and I am stunned that it has an average of 4/5... I have one recommendation, STAY AWAY from this product. I starting using &amp;#34;Just Natural&amp;#34; brands - much better. Hope this helps you.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local food store and had high hopes for it because of the great reviews here.  It smells fantastic but after I put it on, my hands are just way too greasy.  I feel like I need to wipe them off on my clothes.  I really hoped to love this lotion, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I love the peppermint soap though!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find this lotion!  I love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s brand and I use their soaps all the time.  This has the best ingredients if you&#x27;re looking for something organic and if you&#x27;re wanting to avoid nasty chemicals.  It takes only very little to cover your hands, which is great because the bottle will last a long time.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and it doesn&#x27;t have a watery feel like some lotions do either.  It feels very silky-smooth and nice.  My only complaint is that it apparently has A LOT of alcohol in it.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s there as a preservative, but the alcohol smell overwhelms the peppermint smell, which is a little disappointing.  I&#x27;m also concerned that so much alcohol could dry my skin out instead of moisturzing.  I alternate what I use on my hands between this, jojoba oil (which feels great and is good for you skin), and organic coconut oil (which feels great and is known to keep your skin youthful looking, but is definitely greasy until it soaks in after a couple of minutes).  I&#x27;m happy to have Dr. Bronner&#x27;s as an occasional lotion.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;~Good quality&lt;br /&gt;~Love the Peppermint smell&lt;br /&gt;~Best price on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;~Leaves my skin a little dry (don&#x27;t know why this is)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll take a little bit of dry skin (use coconut oil to supplement) for the quality of ingredients and smell!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to getting moisture back to the skin, instead of creamy lotion. Do you have dry skin even after you put lotion on. Try this and you will see the difference, moist skin at last. (note some dry skin is an allergy). (my first scent choice)</li>
    <li> Its a little thin but I like how it works compared to the chemical lotions. Every time i use it people say my office smells so good.</li>
    <li> If you have never used Dr Bronner&#x27;s, you are missing out.  I use the Peppermint oil soap for my shower every day, including as a shampoo.  (My wife prefers and uses the Lavender or the Eucalyptus).  This organic and fair trade produce cleans better than anything I have ever  used.</li>
    <li> product arrived on time,well packaged and in perfect condition.since i got it,i use it every day - even for the face.it smells great and feels great on the skin.overall an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This has a gellous feel and fresh, peppermint smell.  It dries non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel like a bunch of chemicals slathered on.  I love this stuff and I&#x27;ll always have it &amp;#34;on hand&amp;#34;...no pun intended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how people can say this has a good smell (peppermint) is very strong, I&#x27;m not sure if it is the alcohol or the peppermint but I feel like a walking Clorets gum...after two weeks I think I got used to the fragrance but even so I find it very strong, if you LOVE peppermint I think you may like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now why I give it two stars?, the main is reason is because it&#x27;s too drying for me, I love the organic stuff, I find it great that all the contents seems to be high quality and certified!!! that&#x27;s very hard to find, but if it does not accomplish the purpose of what it was made for, then what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using until I finish the bottle if I find any improvement I&#x27;ll come back to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has so many positive reviews out there that I wish it would worked for me but it seems is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Bronner&#x27;s liquid peppermint soap for many years and this lotion is another product that has found a permanent place in my home.  The lotion is very light, kind of runny, not a heavy Vaseline-style, and non-greasy.  I can&#x27;t stand greasy lotion.  As a man, my hands get dried out pretty bad from work, really split bad sometimes, and this stuff brings them back to life.  The peppermint smell is light, I was skeptical at first, but it&#x27;s not a strong smell.  My wife really likes it too, especially since it smooths my hands and she also likes the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this lotion as a gift to some family members and they were raving about how good it works.  Time to order more.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this item for Christmas, the first shipment contained both bottles leaking from the top pumps!  I returned the item and ordered another and the same thing happened! Since it was so close to Christmas I wiped it off and handed it to her unwrapped of course!Don&#x27;t know what the problem was, but I wouldn&#x27;t order this again!</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It is completely organic and I use it as a total moisturizer. I especially like the fact that if I use it on my hands and then prepare food that no nasty chemicals will end up in the food. You may find you have to use more often than the  drug store lotions but it is not made with &amp;#34;mystery chemicals&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t mind applying more often. The price at Amazon is the best I have found anywhere. I use to purchase directly from the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website. Thank you Amazon for offering this product.</li>
    <li> This is really great lotion and I love the peppermint smell.  I found it once in a store but haven&#x27;t since.  I wish there was a larger refill bottle.  I looked on many website and could only find the 8 oz size.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I use it for aftershave and it does the trick perfectly. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> the product was smaller than i had anticipated, but it&#x27;s very good quality. thank you dr. bronners! i am always satisfied.</li>
    <li> Initially the lotion seemed very moisturizing but, similar to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Lip Balm, it seemed to be less moisturizing and maybe a little drying.  Again, I very much like the peppermint fragrance which is relatively long lasting.  I have been using it now just for the fragraance but have switched to another product for moisturizing.  Also, when it arrived, the lotion had leaked out of both bottles for some reason and made a small mess in the sealed plastic bag.  I may not order this product again but I do love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> feels great and cool.</li>
