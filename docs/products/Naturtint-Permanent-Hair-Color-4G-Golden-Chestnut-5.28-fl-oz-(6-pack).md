      <li>Overall I think this is the best hair color you can buy.</li>
      <li>Tried Naturtint and love it.</li>
      <li>After coloring my hair for many years with department store hair colors I found this brand on sale at my health food store.  </li>
      <li>Many of the ingredients I just listed are considered &amp;#34;probably&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;potentially&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to go get it at the store each month.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair healthy, bouncy , shiny.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Use it mostly to cover up grays.</li>
      <li>Love the conditioner that comes with it.</li>
      <li>I have been using Naturtint for many years.  </li>
      <li>Great natural looking colors</li>
      <li>Much more economical and convenient plus a great product that gives a very natural and healthy looking hair .</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the prettiest, most natural color, with it&#x27;s own beautiful dimensions and highlights, while never damaging my hair like all the others do, and it never stinks of ammonia (since it doesn&#x27;t have any ammonia)!</li>
      <li>and it is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Overall, great money saver when you buy 6-pack deal, great quality, natural product.</li>
      <li>So ordering through Amazon offers an amazing savings of more than $10 per box.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lastly, it makes my hair shinier and it feels great.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s like getting three free boxes when ordering from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth when applied.  </li>
      <li>No strong chemical smell, excellent gray coverage and leaves hair shiny and silky!</li>
      <li>More importantly it covers really stubborn gray!</li>
      <li>The first time I ever used this brand I got compliments on how healthy my hair looked.  </li>
      <li>I love this brand of haircolor because it&#x27;s all natural and it saves my hair from becoming brittle and thinning.  </li>
      <li>And since this is much safer, I can color more often without worry.</li>
      <li>Color is true to color option.  </li>
      <li>My hair grows rather quickly and my roots will start showing after 3 weeks, so I have gray roots for 1 week before I color it.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I am so happy with this product it has great coverage of the greys maybe not better than any other product</li>
      <li>Great and healthy hair product for covering grey naturally - cannot live without it!</li>
      <li>And you don&#x27;t have to worry about hair dye as this is the more natural hair color dye</li>
      <li>Therefore, by ordering 6 boxes I get one year&#x27;s worth of hair color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I color my hair to match my original hair color as much as possible and most people have no idea that I color my hair</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finding the right color is a bit tricky, but I think I lucked out.  </li>
      <li>Super gentle</li>
      <li>As a wonderful and necessary extra, this particular hair color is so close to my own and rich and complex</li>
      <li>And since it does no damage to the hair, this product is  very gentle on the hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My mother actually spent close to 15 dollars a purchase, and I am glad that I looked this item up on amazon, save half and be happy.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I did not have those wretched stains on my head.  </li>
      <li>hair didn&#x27;t smell like chemicals, and felt so soft and smooth after washing.  </li>
      <li>I noticed the difference almost at the first application, so that encouraged me to keep using it.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t really cover the gray !</li>
      <li>First of all the ingredients do not contain any of the harmful agents I had been concerned about, including No ammonia, No resorcinol, No parabens, No silicones, No paraffin, No formaldehyde derivatives, No Sodium lauryl sulfate,</li>
      <li>The color pretty much comes out to be like in the picture  </li>
      <li>Great product if you just want to just give your regular hair color a little boost , even if you are not looking to cover grey.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and never stings.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product esp.</li>
      <li>The conditioner makes my hair very silky.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>No heavy metals like aluminum, No mineral oils, No artificial frangrances.  </li>
      <li>Whole Foods sells it for $18.00 a box.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell if this color would be too light or too dark (the color on the cover of the box is different from the color on the top.)  </li>
      <li>Vibrant color, hair feels and looks much healthier</li>
      <li>as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to be light brown or even medium brown .</li>
      <li>I love it even though its darker shade, not golden at all</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase. I believe that says it all!</li>
    <li> The color pretty much comes out to be like in the picture  i.e dark brown with a little reddish-Golden touch ( not entirely golden ) . Overall, the color looks o.k  as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to be light brown or even medium brown .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than the box color. But I&#x27;ve used  it for  a while it keeps my hair healthy and does not dry my tips like other permanent hair colors. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Naturtint hair color is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have dark brown/gray hair and like to lighten it a little and cover the gray. This seems to do it and it lasts quite some time. Thanks</li>
    <li> The best! Even coloring, no skin irritation, stays longer than any over the counter CVS products. I tried it some time ago and felt the difference. No going back to anything else.Overall, great money saver when you buy 6-pack deal, great quality, natural product.</li>
    <li> Best hair color I have ever used, Make hair shine looks natural. And I,am a retired hairdresser.</li>
    <li> This color is so good that when I was getting a hair cut another stylist  came over and asked what color are you using on her it is magnificent!  She laughed and said she got it out of a box and does her own color.  It gives you color with highlight&#x27;s built it. I buy six boxes at a time to get a better price.  Whole Foods sells it for $18.00 a box.  Amazon gives you a great deal!</li>
    <li> Received it in a timely manner and got it for a great price. Colors my hair well without damaging it. Love the conditioner that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells great and it is easy to apply. No harmful chemicals and the price is excellent. The color is little dark but I didn&#x27;t mind. The conditioner makes my hair very silky. Overall I think this is the best hair color you can buy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used lots of different hair colors before and for years.  This is the first time I did not have those wretched stains on my head.  It seemed to take to the hair and not the skin (I even did my eyebrows, and didn&#x27;t end up looking like a wacked out Joan Crawford.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the right color is a bit tricky, but I think I lucked out.  I couldn&#x27;t tell if this color would be too light or too dark (the color on the cover of the box is different from the color on the top.)  It did, like most colors, go on dark for the first day or so, but softened over the next couple of washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair didn&#x27;t smell like chemicals, and felt so soft and smooth after washing.  Usually, my hair frizzes a bit.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have had grey hair since my 20&#x27;s (now I am in my late 30&#x27;s) so I have been using use all kind of  hair color products to conceal my gray hair since then. I don&#x27;t go the saloon to cover my gray hair I just buy the products at the store. After several years using  hair colors poducts my hair looked brittle and unhealthy and I got some split ends. Also my hair would tangle a lot, no matter what conditioner or treatment I would use to fix it,  I would cut my hair regularly to get rid of the dry hair that would cause the tangle, but that wouldn&#x27;t work at all. Anything would work. My hair was so dull. So when I found this product, even though I found it expensive I gave it a try. I knew all the chemicals in the other hair colors damaged my hair, but since this product claimed to be natural I thought it would help to heal my so damaged hair. I noticed the difference almost at the first application, so that encouraged me to keep using it. after a year or so and a couple of trips to the hair dresser to trim my hair, my hair is now almost complexly healed. It shines and it doesn&#x27;t tangle anymore and I don&#x27;t need conditioner to untangle it. I am so happy with this product it has great coverage of the greys maybe not better than any other product but it keeps my hair healthy. And now that I found it on Amazon with this great value pack I save 50% of the retail value.</li>
    <li> I have tried every hair color for over 10 years and always hated the smell; had to keep the window open! Tried Naturtint and love it. works great; stays with me for 4-6 wks depending on sun exposure, and no smell!!! It&#x27;s a bit expensive at Whole Foods or other groceries, but this price is fantastic. If you use the same color; try the 6 pack. I love that I don&#x27;t have to go get it at the store each month.</li>
    <li> This dye does not really damage the hair as much as other dyes. I really like it. Use it mostly to cover up grays.</li>
    <li> My wife was delighted to received her hair color so far and in great shape. This is her second order and would not be her last.</li>
    <li> The whole foods market near me stopped carrying this brand.  Now that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon, I&#x27;m so happy because the price is much better here than in the stores.  I love this brand of haircolor because it&#x27;s all natural and it saves my hair from becoming brittle and thinning.  As a wonderful and necessary extra, this particular hair color is so close to my own and rich and complex (I have not tried other colors).  The first time I ever used this brand I got compliments on how healthy my hair looked.  My friend bought this brand to use for herself because of how good my hair looks.  I also find that this brand is easier to use than others, ie.  less mess!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years.  The color does not fade, covers my gray hair perfectly, and has no chemical smell.  I use it once every three weeks because of my exposing roots.  I especially like that there are no harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service</li>
    <li> Naturtint hair color has long lasting color and doesn&#x27;t dry out or damage your hair.</li>
    <li> I really like that this product doesn&#x27;t contain many of the unhealthy chemicals that other brands do. I&#x27;ve seen that someone else stated they didn&#x27;t think it covered their gray long enough, but the expensive salon colors I&#x27;ve received don&#x27;t either. And since this is much safer, I can color more often without worry. Lastly, it makes my hair shinier and it feels great.</li>
    <li> Great and healthy hair product for covering grey naturally - cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> Brilliant color, covers the gray, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
    <li> Covers gray with natural color that last. It is gentle and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Totally perfect gray cover!  Love the results!</li>
    <li> I have used Naturtint for years and won&#x27;t go back to the drugstore brands.  It&#x27;s gentle and never stings.  This 6-pack is the best buy I&#x27;ve seen so I purchase this about every four months.  For this price, I would only get three at my local health food store but it&#x27;s like getting three free boxes when ordering from Amazon.  Great product, great deal!</li>
    <li> A great deal as what you pay for in the stores is a lot more!  And you don&#x27;t have to worry about hair dye as this is the more natural hair color dye</li>
    <li> I love it even though its darker shade, not golden at all</li>
    <li> this ismy favorite hair brand.no smelly chemicals</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 years now.  Very gentle to my scalp and non drying like other product I had used in the past. Fast shipment and great price!</li>
    <li> My hair was getty dry , dull &amp; lifeless with these permanent commercial dyes. And since my hair is almost 50% grey, it was hard to find a good hair color that would add the color without damaging my hair. Since i have been using this product, my hair is shiny &amp; not dull &amp; drab anymore. Growth is even better.&lt;br /&gt;Pros : Leaves hair healthy, bouncy , shiny.&lt;br /&gt;  Great natural looking colors&lt;br /&gt;  Excellent product to replace commercial brand name expensive salon colors.&lt;br /&gt;  Cheaper than salon color treatment.&lt;br /&gt;  Can be used for females or males&lt;br /&gt;  Excellent color &amp; body enhancer&lt;br /&gt;  And since it does no damage to the hair, this product is  very gentle on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;  Great product if you just want to just give your regular hair color a little boost , even if you are not looking to cover grey.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not last as long as conventional hair color if one has a lot of grey&lt;br /&gt;  Solution:  One just needs to use it more often , like touch up every 2-3 weeks. Even then it is a major cost saving.</li>
    <li> On time,  good packaging , love it&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This is the only hair dye for me. Organic, less abrasive and it really works.</li>
    <li> You will never find anywhere that beats this price. I bought these for my mother, and if you calculate the price of each pack, you are getting one for around 7 bucks. My mother actually spent close to 15 dollars a purchase, and I am glad that I looked this item up on amazon, save half and be happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Vibrant color, hair feels and looks much healthier</li>
    <li> I have been using Naturtint for many years.  started ordering from Amazon for 2 years now.  It has been great.  Much more economical and convenient plus a great product that gives a very natural and healthy looking hair .</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color in the market.  No strong chemical smell, excellent gray coverage and leaves hair shiny and silky!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but I always come back to this brand. Does not sting my scalp or smell horrible like other brands. Super gentle and they may have upgraded their formula because it used to make my scalp itch, and it doesn&#x27;t any more. More importantly it covers really stubborn gray!</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t really cover the gray !</li>
    <li> After coloring my hair for many years with department store hair colors I found this brand on sale at my health food store.  I have recently begun to read ingredient lists and was concerned about what was being absorbed into my body from hair dye.  I also was concerned about the burning sensation I felt every time I dyed my hair, even though I &amp;#34;passed&amp;#34; the allergy test on my arm every time.  So I tried Naturtint.  First of all the ingredients do not contain any of the harmful agents I had been concerned about, including No ammonia, No resorcinol, No parabens, No silicones, No paraffin, No formaldehyde derivatives, No Sodium lauryl sulfate, No heavy metals like aluminum, No mineral oils, No artificial frangrances.  Many of the ingredients I just listed are considered &amp;#34;probably&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;potentially&amp;#34; carcinogenic.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as to the product&#x27;s effectiveness, I have been using Naturtint for more than 3 years now.  I am 56 years old and am 100% gray.  I color my hair to match my original hair color as much as possible and most people have no idea that I color my hair - that&#x27;s how natural it looks.  I follow the directions, leaving the color on my roots for 30-40 minutes and then spread the rest down to the ends of my hair for the last 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I have baby-fine hair which is short/medium in length and have found a way to &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34;.  I divide the developer in half, and the colorant in half, using only half the product at one time.  Of course you cannot mix them and then divide them - they must be divided in half before they are mixed. By dividing them in half I can get 2 colorings out of one box.  Therefore, by ordering 6 boxes I get one year&#x27;s worth of hair color.&lt;br /&gt;I order the color through Amazon but it comes from the company, Naturtint, when I order 6 boxes at one time.  The cost for 1 case (6 boxes) is $41.94 which works out to $6.99 per box.  At my health food store the regular, non-sale, price is $17.00.  So ordering through Amazon offers an amazing savings of more than $10 per box.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, people ask me how long the color lasts.  I have been coloring my hair for 20 years now.  I would say that Naturtint lasts at least as long as the drug store brands.  My hair grows rather quickly and my roots will start showing after 3 weeks, so I have gray roots for 1 week before I color it.  If I was a fanatic about my roots I would need to color it every 3 weeks, but I manage to stretch it out to once per month.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend Naturtint.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smooth when applied.  Color lasts longer.  Reeceived compliments on color and texture. Color is true to color option.  Really liked it!</li>
    <li> Love it and I have been using for 3 three yeas , color is very natural look and last two months.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I had expected.</li>
    <li> Found this product 8 years ago and have been using it religiously since then. I&#x27;ve had to dye my hair since I was 13 due to premature grey that runs in my family, so I&#x27;m familiar with a LOT of hair coloring products. This is absolutely the prettiest, most natural color, with it&#x27;s own beautiful dimensions and highlights, while never damaging my hair like all the others do, and it never stinks of ammonia (since it doesn&#x27;t have any ammonia)! Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS!!! : )  Covers gray well, nice warm color.</li>
    <li> I really like this product esp. the condition which made My hair so soft after coloring. The color looks so natural.</li>
