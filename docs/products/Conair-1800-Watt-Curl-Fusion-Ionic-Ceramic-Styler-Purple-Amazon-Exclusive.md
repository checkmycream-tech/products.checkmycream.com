<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i have fine curly hair- i like it - i think its worth trying.</li>
    <li> No difference than other dryers IMO. AND the diffusers constantly falls off</li>
    <li> I love this dryer!  It dries hair super fast and keeps curls in tact.  I have fine hair with loose curls and my hair always looks bouncier when I use this dryer.  The diffuser attachment is great too and helps to dry the hair without changing the shape of your curls.  Very happy I found this dryer!  It&#x27;s saved my hair from a lot of damage from regular gun type dryers!</li>
    <li> Great in theory... Needs a large cup to keep hair in while diffusing...also, if you have long hair, it can get tangled &amp; sucked into the back of this machine. The advantage of the conventional hair dryers is that they are long &amp; keep hair farther from the back where all the air is sucked into it... Not bad thou...</li>
    <li> alittle to much flow for curly hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k.  I don&#x27;t use it much.  Bought one for my daughter too.  She doesn&#x27;t use hers much either</li>
    <li> Great little dryer, with only one shortfall - it needs a &amp;#34;bowl&amp;#34; around the diffuser part to hold your hair in one place while you&#x27;re drying it.  To that end, I McGuyver&#x27;d an old Sunbeam diffuser I had to work with this dryer using my Dremel.  See photo attached.  Other than not having a bowl, it&#x27;s great!  If you want yours to have a bowl, do what I did and make one.  I love mine even better, now.  It works fine without the bowl, but I have very fine blonde curly hair and needed the bowl to hold my curls in place while drying.</li>
    <li> Currently own this model and purchasing a second one &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; because they&#x27;re so difficult to find. A must have for curly haired girls. I&#x27;ve found that it does a way better job than diffuser attachments.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Arrived promptly</li>
    <li> It came in quick and well packaged, but the product it self, not so good in use. The power plugging system is not applicable in Australia, and due to its direction I have to use not one, but two electric devices to connect it. It gets too hot and red, kinda scary to use and makes too much noise. I do not recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Second one and it has not lasted more than 3 months either time.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length curly hair and this dries it fast even on the low setting. The heat isn&#x27;t variable, just the air flow, but it&#x27;s the right temp for me- hot but not scorching hot. It packs well and isn&#x27;t too hefty. The only downside is that if I do want to blow it straight I still need another dryer. So great if you&#x27;re curly everyday, but don&#x27;t toss the regular dryer if you ever want to mix it up.</li>
    <li> This is my second Curl Fusion hair dryer.  The first one is still working just fine, but I like to have a back-up hair dryer so I won&#x27;t end up with wet hair and a dead hair dryer.  I really like this dryer so I am relieved to find this as a &amp;#34;Today&#x27;s Deal&amp;#34; on Amazon.  Price was great.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly and i thought this would be great to try since my diffuser broke. I like the idea of it always diffusing the heat/air but i could nit straighten my bangs with it...at meant bringing out the original dryer to do my bangs! Ugh! Also, when i flipped my head dow to dry the underneath layers my hair git caught in the dryer...had to return it. Must be better for short hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair dryer a few times now, and I absolutely love it!  My old one was also a Conair with a diffuser, but it was the traditional shape.  It worked great, but I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try, in hopes of saving some space in the bathroom and in my suitcase when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that it wasn&#x27;t as loud as my old one.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong - it makes noise.  I think that&#x27;s unavoidable for a hair dryer.  But it was certainly not as loud as the other one.  Also, it dries my hair faster than the other one.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but it does.  I have long, curly hair (type 3a, for those who know what that means), and I use this hair dryer with the diffuser to dry it most of the way and then let it air dry the rest of the way.  It&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY thing I would change is that the cool shot button is just a button, rather than a switch.  What that means is that when I want to finish with cool air to set my curls, I have to hold down the button the whole time, which gets a little tiring for my poor thumb.  The hair dryer has two settings - high and low.  High is for high heat and low is for medium heat, I guess.  My other hair dryer has cool, medium and hot, PLUS a cool shot switch.  That being said, this hair dryer is still my favorite, and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this blow-dryer, I had to air dry my curls becuase otherwise I&#x27;d be left with a big frizzy disaster on my head. I&#x27;ve used it several times now and I can&#x27;t believe the difference. My curls are neat, shiny, and I my hair has real volume instead of just poofiness. It&#x27;s also much, much easier to straighten my hair after using this than a blow-dryer for normal hair.&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I&#x27;d bought one sooner, it&#x27;s an incredible difference!! No complaints!</li>
    <li> Had a similar dryer that was over  20  years old and only worked by shaking it so I am extremely happy&lt;br /&gt;With the replacement</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t really use this for my curls.  If I choose to go curly I usualy let my hair dry naturally.  That being said I do have very curly hair and when I use a regular blow dryer my hair seems to go pretty flat fast, but the conair dryer give me more volume.  I have thin hair, but it is curly, not a good combo.  This dryer works just has fast as my CHI dryer and for a fraction of the cost.  Having to hold the cool button doesn&#x27;t really other me since I just give my hair a shot at the end.  I also turn my head upside down to give it a little more body.</li>
    <li> My daughter has super long, tight, ringlets that are impossible to dry. She usually just lets them air dry but sometimes that&#x27;s not possible and normal dryers give her a giant ball of fluff. This has been her favorite hair dryer. A must for those with curls!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, frizzy hair. I have been trying to find a diffusor that would do the job and finally I did. I love it. It dries my hair and keeps my curls without causing them to frizz up like other diffusors would. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My wife had an original curley top hair dryed that she managed to maintain for many years. Unfortunately 20 plus years using the dryer finally killed it about a year ago. She was always saying hoe she liked the fact it dudn&#x27;t fry her hair and was compact.  Some replicas were posted online, but wherd always out of stock. Buying from ebay used just seemed like rolloing the dice on that old of a product, and the price wanted was more than these new ones.  I ran across this product on amazon this past week and knew i needed to get it. Its by conair, same as ghe original, but noted to be a bit updated in mechanism.  So far a week into using it, she really likes it.  It is more power ghan the old model, so she finds herself using the low power to get the temp of her old model. But, she says it drys without the fry factor.  She had been trying defusder and various dryers, but has finally found her replacement with this. Must have if fan of the original.</li>
    <li> nice and light weight - enough power and a good price</li>
    <li> Works well with my long, thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> works great and dries quickly.  It&#x27;s light and since it&#x27;s flat, it lays on counter easily.</li>
    <li> The diffuser part of the hairdryer allows too much air flow, which causes my curls to dry frizzy. Also, it&#x27;s not powerful enough and takes quite awhile to dry my hair in comparison with more expensive models. I&#x27;ve given this to my daughter, who is 2. Given her age, the quieter noise and lower heat doesn&#x27;t scare her the way other hairdryers have.</li>
    <li> I have had thus style hair dyer from Conair and I love it.  I have naturally curly hair and hate to have attach a diffuser to a regular already weighty hair dryer that falls off in the middle of using it.  This is an all in one diffuser and hair dryer and is very light weight.  It is also great for travel!  My last version lasted about 5 years.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer for curly hair!  This is the only hair dryer that I use with my naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! This is exactly what I was looking for and I could only find it on Amazon. My sister had one of these back in the 80&#x27;s (it still works!), but it&#x27;s in Oregon so I can use it when I visit family. I recently grew my hair out and I have curls I never did before! This dryer works GREAT!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected, love it!!  The price was really good, I had ordered a used one some months ago and paid more for it than the new one!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this.  Great for travel as it is very light and compact.  Keeps my curls soft and frizz free.</li>
    <li> Conair Curl Fushion Ionic Hair Dryer works well and was priced well. I like the 2 speeds and the cool air button.</li>
    <li> This is the updated and re-introduced version of the \\&quot;Curly Top\\&quot; dryers that came out in the 80&#x27;s. I&#x27;m SO grateful it has returned!! This is the only dryer that truly embraces curly and wavy hair--whether it&#x27;s course, medium, or baby fine flyaway hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regular blow dryers with diffuser attachments simply don&#x27;t match the gentleness of this dryer. And I love the curl lifting attachment; it allows the circulating air to reach under the top layers, so the hair underneath can lift and and dry without over drying (or frizzing) the outer layers. Pure genius!</li>
    <li> I started growing my hair out and wanted to accent my natural curls.  Not big and bulky like some other dryers/diffusers I&#x27;ve used.  Love it!  When/if this one goes, I&#x27;ll be buying another.</li>
    <li> I had a curly perm and this dryer is great - use it with the attachment-- to dry when I don&#x27;t want to wait for air drying.  If I don&#x27;t use the attached finger-like thing, the hair moves, which is not what I need.</li>
    <li> Not as awesome as I expected. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is light weight and perfect for natural curley hair.  Had one years ago and was delighted to find one again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after unsuccessfully trying to find a diffuser that fit my hair dryer. It works great! It has two settings plus a &#x27;cool&#x27; button. This is diffuser, not a blow dryer. It is meant to have a gentle heat so as not to disturb your curly hair the way a regular hair dryer would do.</li>
    <li> I have fine, naturally wavy hair and when I use a normal blow dryer, it just frizzes it up and straightens the wave.  But when I use this, it dries it beautifully, while keeping the body.  I use it while flipping my hair upside down and it creates excellent fullness...which, having such fine hair, I am desperate for!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 78 years old and this is perfect for my natural curly hair.  I can wash, dry, go!  This is my second Conair Curl Fusion:)</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for anyone with curly hair.  It makes styling my hair quick and easy. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has very little power and it takes forever to dry my hair. I am very disappointed! I would have returned it, unfortunately I threw away the box and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
    <li> Great dryer for curly hair.  blows in a wide path, gently but warm.  perfect to get the curls dry but not blow them around to create frizz.  I like using the attachment to lift hair from the scalp to add a little body.</li>
    <li> Did not know they had made an updated curly top hairdryer!  works great.  the low speed is the best part</li>
    <li> Loved this small dryer.  Very handy for travel and easy on the arms because it&#x27;s so light weight.  .....however, it stopped working after about 8 months.  And that was not even with every day usage.</li>
    <li> christmas gift for my niece she likes it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had one similar so I bought it.  It is really nice and great for travel as it doesn&#x27;t take up as much room in the suitcase.</li>
    <li> NOT ENOUGH FORCE TO DRY HAIR</li>
    <li> Does have wide flow but only gets to warm, not hot</li>
    <li> Great drier. I have curly hair and this works perfectly. Dries fast. Comfortably to hold. Quiet. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t blow the curl or body out of my hair.  I like the way the spikes add body and help the hair next to your scalp dry quickly without flattening it out.  I think it dries faster than the old diffuser that I used to use.  I would have given this  5 stars if the cord was longer.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews closely, then I bought it. I have thin, baby fine, curly hair.  I can&#x27;t use a lot of product or my head breaks out.  I  had a regular dryer. That I attached a diffuser to, but it whipped my hair around and I scrunched my curls with a towel.  This does not whip my hair around, I didn&#x27;t scrunched the curls and my hair had MORE volume and curls.  My husband even noted the difference.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that I could take to the gym and pack in my suitcase for traveling and this fits the bill nicely. My one issue is that it really doesn&#x27;t perform as well as a diffuser on my dryer.</li>
    <li> I use this for traveling -drys and styles my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Used to have one years ago-they are hard to find!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item before.  It has a nice built in diffuser, which makes it much easier to dry your hair.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed for my fine curly hair.  So easy to use and the weight is perfect for me to handle !!</li>
    <li> Very bulky so I wouldn&#x27;t pack it on a trip, and thought it would cost much less</li>
    <li> Was a gift and the recipient loved it :)</li>
    <li> If there&#x27;s one thing I insist upon it&#x27;s a good hair dryer, and hotel built-ins leave a LOT to be desired. The Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer is a great alternative. It&#x27;s shaped to sit flat, so it fits well in a suitcase without taking up too much space. It&#x27;s also extremely lightweight. I recently did a six-day trip with my small suitcase and was still able to take this along. The diffuser/volumizer also twists off easily, making the appliance even more compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for drying performance, the Conair gets another thumbs-up. The attachment detangles my hair just like my trusty [[ASIN:B0052BHMOO Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer]]. In fact, because this dryer doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot, I believe it will be less damaging to my hair overall. This might be an issue if you have really thick hair in terms of drying time, but it&#x27;s fine for someone like me with baby fine hair. It also helps lock in curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produces voluminous, tangle-free locks, even on the go. What more could a girl ask for?!</li>
    <li> I brought the Conair curl fusion iconic ceramic styler hair dryer for my sister she loves it. She has very curly hair</li>
    <li> I had another brand dryer of this type for about 20 years and it finally gave up  the ghost and I have been looking for a replacement for a couple of years.  I have been using the standard hand held dryer with the attachment but just never worked the same and was clumsy and hard to use.  This dryer is much easier.  My only complaint is the length of the cord.  With the oversized plug it could use a longer cord.</li>
    <li> I had a hand dryer similar to this for over 20 yrs until it died recently - saw this &amp; ordered it - it&#x27;s actually better than the one I had!</li>
    <li> She likes it: light, easy to store. handle and does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Don&lt;br /&gt;one two three four</li>
    <li> Great product. Works great for curly and natural black hair.  As always Conair has lived up to its expectation for hair care products.  I have been using their products for over 20 years and has never been disappointed</li>
    <li> I was really looking for a diffuser to use with curly hair. This blows so strong even on the low setting that it&#x27;s really just a flat hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot use it to &amp;#34;scrunch dry&amp;#34; curly hair, because any hair near it will be immediately sucked in to the fan and ripped out of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a big disappointment</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not for me. I have really Long hair and it gets sucked up into the fan way to easily. Possibly better for someone with short hair.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works well with my naturally curly hair.  I use it every day and my curls are perfect.</li>
    <li> A must have for anyone with curly hair. Works great with the pixie curl method. Wish I had this years ago!</li>
    <li> I like this dryer; the diffuser helps to keep the shape of the curl while drying hair quickly with gentle heat. I had one of the older &#x27;curly top&amp;#34; dryers that finally gave up the ghost and was glad to have found this one to replace it! It&#x27;s a good buy in my book!</li>
    <li> I have very very thick, long curly hair and this  drys my hair quickly and easily.  I would recommend it people who want to get there hair dried in a quick few minutes.</li>
    <li> Good replacement for my old Windemere curly top hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is ok, but the plug is so large and the cord directly below the cord is so inflexible that I cannot plug it into one of my bathroom outlets and in order to use the other outlet, I have to use an extension cord.  The dryer itself doesn&#x27;t really seem to be any better for my curly hair than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve used.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Good price, very gentle on your hair, especially if you have curly</li>
    <li> The name says it all (Curl Fusion). Really gives you full body (sexy) curls. Very light and easy carry for traveling.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how forceful the air flow was (not something I wanted for my curly hair) and how noisy it was (I have to wear earplugs). I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hairdryer. I don&#x27;t know what I would do with out this. I had one for almost 10 years before it wore out and was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find another, after looking in the stores everywhere I gave up and looked online and Amazon had it. The very same color and everything. The new one works just as good and I expect it to last for years.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this hair dryer. As advertised, it allows me to quickly dry my hair, without messing up the curls. The low setting, in particular, does now blow the hair around. It is comfortable to use, not too loud. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I probably would have given this a 5 star rating if it had more than one heat setting.  You can&#x27;t adjust the heat and the heat is very hot.  Other than that it works like it should.</li>
    <li> I would give this dryer a 2.5 rating if I could. It could use more power. Someone -PLEASE come up with a more powerful snub-nosed dryer! I had one from SASSOON (was great) but that one finally gave up.</li>
    <li> This dryer works great for curly hair. I don&#x27;t use the attachment because I like my hair smooth on top and curly on the bottom.  It works MUCH better than my travel dryer that I use with a sock diffuser so this will now also be my travel dryer.</li>
    <li> The lollipop design of this hairdryer is unique, and makes it loads easier to work with, especially for long hair. I can&#x27;t imagine why there aren&#x27;t more hair dryers made like this one, which doesn&#x27;t require you to hold your arms way out or up in the air and try to get the heat just where you want it. It has high and low heats and a good diffuser. Gets the job done fast and easy, and I&#x27;d hate to be without it.</li>
    <li> The Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler is good for frizzing hair and no good for drying while enhancing curls.  If you have hair which can be dried by being blown all over in the air, then this product is good.  BUT it&#x27;s NOT good for curly hair drying as the name implies.</li>
    <li> This works great on my hair, makes getting ready in the morning much faster. I have thick hair and a lot of it, so even though this thing really blows, my curls stay intact without frizz. If you have very fine hair, you may want to try it with the attachment on.</li>
    <li> I purchased the hair drier for my wife to replace an old one, also a Conair.  She loves her new Conair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair dryer 2 times since my initial purchase. It works okay on the low setting, but overheats on the high setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the high setting, the coils turn bright red and the dryer emits a burning odor. If the hair dryer gets too hot, it automatically shuts off for a few minutes and cannot be restarted until it cools down. I would be very cautious in using this device, possible fire hazard.</li>
    <li> This was a gift. I have not heard any complaints.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I love this brand of dryer and it works great. The last Conair I had lasted twenty years or more, Same style. With periodic cleaning of dust it will last many years.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!  It&#x27;s perfect for my natural waves without the frizz.</li>
    <li> I had great expectations for this, but does nothing special for curly hair.  In fact, may add to the frizz factor in comparison to my normal dryer used without a diffuser.  Waste of money - would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have an older model and had hard time finding one.This is a great diffuser...no more frizzy hair after drying.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of customer reviews and decided on buying it.  The diffuser would not stay on the hair dryer and kept falling off. The hair dryer made a real loud rattling noise. I thought I would be lucky to get 1yr out of it before it burned out or broke. It only had a hot setting and prefer hair dryers that have a choice of warm and hot.</li>
    <li> This diffuser dries my wavy/ curly hair quickly, leaving it frizz-free. I just use my fingers and lightly scrunch, and it gives my fine hair more volume than when I let it dry naturally.</li>
    <li> Great little product!</li>
    <li> This dryer blew my fine hair all over the place, completely defeating the purpose of using a diffuser.  It may work for thicker, coarser hair, but for my fine, blonde 2-b/c curls it was useless.  I sent it back and was promptly refunded by Amazon.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair at a slower pace than I am used to but it doesn&#x27;t cause my natural curly hair to frizz either. I gave it four stars because I wish it had a little more power behind the blow!</li>
    <li> Wonderful for curly hair, best blow dryer I have found! Thank you...</li>
    <li> Awesome!!  So glad they still make this.  I&#x27;ve had this dryer for over 7 years and it is just now on its last leg.  I love it because it drys curly hair without blowing it to smithereens.  It is so much better than a diffuser because the propeller type fan distributes hot air so it evenly coats the hair as it drys it.  And your curls stay in tact!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best damn dryer ever.</li>
    <li> This is the hair dryer my curly hair has been dreaming about! My hair dries quickly and curls maintain their shape. In the past other dryers have caused my hair to frizz because it takes so long for the curls to dry. Not with this hair dryer! My curls look amazing and frizz free. I bought another one for my sister and have recommended it to all my curly haired friends.</li>
    <li> just love it  it is perfect for my hair</li>
    <li> My wavy hair requires only a little handling and light touch. I have been enjoying this hair dryer for awhile and it is great and really delivers. It is comfortable to hold and maneuver. While it is gentle on my hair, I would like an even lower speed and even softer blowing of air than the two speeds offered. I&#x27;ve always had wonderful luck with Conair products and this styler is no different.</li>
    <li> I looked at several options for drying my curly hair before choosing to buy this one. There was also the option of buying just the DevaCurl diffuser for my old dryer. I looked at all reviews and there was a negative YouTube review and demonstration that actually sold me as a positive. The girl was blow drying here hair and commented on the downside that there was no air. I thought &amp;#34;duh&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t want air, blowing my curls all around. I hate it when I go outside in the wind. My curls are destroyed. That was what sold me! All the other hairdryers use a diffuser the cut down on the wind or deflect it in another direction. This one doesn&#x27;t have any. I use the dryer&#x27;s diffuser anyway because I want to to put it right down on my head, on my scalp to get to the root of the hair. It doesn&#x27;t burn my head or blow it around. It just dries it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for years, and it&#x27;s perfect for wavy/curly fine hair as it doesn&#x27;t blow it all over the place.  It&#x27;s the ideal solution, but it does take a bit of patience and time if you&#x27;re switching from your typical megawatt dryer!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair. This hair dryer drys it without creating frizz. I wish I had bought it earlier.</li>
    <li> Great on curly hair! The diffuser is awesome too!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled Ladies.  This dryer blew my curls around as hard as any regular dryer.  The force of air is just as strong as a regular dryer and the &amp;#34;diffuser&amp;#34; does not disperse the air.  My curls separated and I am a frizzy mess.  I used it on low with the finger attachment.  I&amp;#34;ll go back to a regular dryer with an attachment.  Nice idea but does not function as it is intended.  sigh.........</li>
    <li> It does the job but takes a lot longer than the diffuser sock used over a regular blow dryer.  Have actually stopped using this one in preference to using the regular dryer with the diffuser sock over it.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  My dryer went out recently and I tried another one that just blew my hair all around even on low.  I love that it helps me keep the curl in my hair without blowing so hard but still dries my hair fast.  I would have given it a 5 star if it had a longer cord.  I also like the fact that it can be held closer to my head which makes drying more convenient than a dryer with a diffuser  on the end.</li>
    <li> Just as good as always</li>
    <li> Returned due to weak flow.  Seems very cheaply made.  Ended up buying a more popular dryer with diffuser attachment.  I ended up quitting prior to my first blowdry.</li>
    <li> my sister loves this  going to order a nother one to have it as a back up  its nice to see someone have a good product for a change</li>
    <li> Great product that dries hair quick....</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to speedily dry and set my curly natural hair style. It offers high,low, cool and hot settings. Really controls frizz on my African American hair. Better to use this product, rather than sitting under a dryer that will blow your hair in all directions. This ceramic styler is also light enough to pack for travel. I was surprised to find a volume lift attachment in the package, which I have not tried yet, but others might find it handy. Good price,speedy and  packaged well for delivery from the vendor.</li>
    <li> Nice product. It&#x27; what she wanted.</li>
    <li> The cord could be a little longer, but the performance is awesome!</li>
    <li> Dries my hair quickly, but it&#x27;s hard to dry it without blowing the curls around.  Anyone with naturally curly hair knows that the secret to perfect curls is that they can&#x27;t be disturbed while drying...  My big dryer with a diffuser works better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS DIFFUSER! IT MADE MY CURLS POP!  IT DRYED MY HAIR IN HALF OF THE TIME, ADDED SHINE AND VOLUME.&lt;br /&gt;ALL WITHOUT THE FRIZZ. THIS AFRICAN AMERICAN CURLY IS VERY HAPPY. I WILL BUY ONE FOR MY SISTER I KNOW SHE WILL LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer.  My hair is naturally curly turned in later life.  I&#x27;m still learning to style my hair.  I like this dryer as it is low blow and great coverage.  It wasn&#x27;t a miracle but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as I had expected, but it does help my hair curl a little better than it was with the typical hair dryer I was using.&lt;br /&gt;My hair will not curl if it gets heated too fast.  All the curl gets blown away.  I thought the cool-shot button would help this problem.  It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s the power behind the blower; so I hold the dryer further away from my hair on the high heat setting and this helps a little.</li>
    <li> This product exceeds my expectation! It is easy to handle and quick to get the job done.</li>
    <li> It curled my hair but I don&#x27;t like the flat piece on the back that sucks my hair up. You have to be very careful using this! I&#x27;m still not sure if I should return it or not as I am too afraid to use it sometimes! Lol!</li>
    <li> Even though it is no one&#x27;s fault, I found out that the item has an American plug.Little did I know that American plugs are different from European ones, so I was a bit disappointed.Had I known earlier, I would have ordered one converter. Maybe this information should be included in the product&#x27;s features because some people don&#x27;t know that.So I have this hair dryer and I have to find a converter for 1800 W...Three stars,  which  later will be changed ( possibly ) into more or less depending on the quality.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer for curly hair.  It keeps the natural curls in without being frizzy &amp; blown all over the place.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> I am having the hardest time finding a replacement for my old diffuser and this isn&#x27;t it.  The best diffusers are sort of bowl shaped so it cups your hair.  This thing?  I don&#x27;t know what the heck it does.  And with the sides also being open there is way too much air coming out for a real diffuser.  It&#x27;s going back today.</li>
    <li> I have not used it yet, but it looks like it will be nice.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is just the hair dryer that I needed.... I have naturally wavy and some curly hair..... This dries it quickly ....keeps the curls in and give lots of volume.  Very happy with this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I love it! Even though the strength of the air flow is not the same as in any regular hair dryer, it leaves my hair beautiful and frizzless. I love it!</li>
    <li> Bought this to help my non-curly hair dry with more body.  Just flip your hair upside down and move the dryer up til it is near your head.  The fingers swirl your hair into waves while the heat dries it that way.  Not as loud as some dryers I&#x27;ve had, but louder than a few.  And the ion feature dries without fuzzies, for me.  Great job.</li>
    <li> Have been frustrated for years with diffuser attachments, but this dryer/diffuser is ideal.  No air blowing out and frizzing my hair.  Thank you Conair!</li>
    <li> Easy to handle.  arrived quickly.  no problems.</li>
    <li> Hate this, makes my hair limp and lifeless. A regular dryer with a diffuser is much better.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and I love it.  These are hard to find and was so happy to find it at Amazon!</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and it came quick!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I ever used!!</li>
    <li> Bought one at a store 5 years ago and it lasted a couple of years. Bought a couple of these because I couldn&#x27;t find them for a while. The first one didn&#x27;t last a long as I would have wished, only a couple of months. But when it works, it&#x27;s great for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this hair dryer.  I had one just like it for 15+ years - it held up through traveling everyday use sometimes twice a day.  I looked in all the retail stores for another one and finally found it here on Amazon.  This is one Happy girl !!!!</li>
    <li> I have long Curly and hate the frizzies, so I wished for this on my wish list and got it! It is fantastic, and works great! I have been searching for a long time for a quick way to dry my hair without the frizzies, and this did the trick!  If you have curly hair  and need to dry it quickly, dont hesitate to buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Good price too!</li>
    <li> This product is okay. If you take the time to slowly use this diffuser starting with wet hair, then the curls are definitely more lively but overall I don&#x27;t know if it made enough of a difference for my hair, to make it worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Love the way it dries my curls without getting it frizzy</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer for my natural curly hair!!</li>
    <li> Had one of these years ago and couldn&#x27;t find one in the stores. Then I thought I would look it up on line and see if I could find one. And I couldn&#x27;t believe It. There it was. I love this hair drier..</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hair dryer that I&#x27;ve ever owned and is perfect for my curly hair. It&#x27;s much easier to hold and manuever because of its flatter design. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser. It doesn&#x27;t have any attachments that pop off. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like the results I get with this blow dryer and diffuser attachment for my curly hair. It does take a bit of getting used to with the non-traditional shape and my biggest complaint with this product is that it takes much longer to get hot than most blow dryers.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for many years to replace my second Windmere Curly-top hair dryer which burned-out on me several years ago.  I have thick, coarse, curly hair and using a traditional hair dryer, even with a diffuser, causes it to get frizzy-blowout.  I am thrilled that this hair dryer works, and is designed like, my Curly-top dryers.  Soft curls with minimum frizz.</li>
    <li> Because it&#x27;s a diffuser I expected it to take a long time to dry my hair, but even on the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting my hair is dry almost as quickly as normal dryers manage on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;! Will know in a few months whether it&#x27;s really less damaging.</li>
    <li> I have very long curly hair and when I use this blow dryer my hair gets sucked in the back and it creates a knot. I have used many different blow dryers and diffusers and have never had this problem. It would be great for short hair.</li>
    <li> Lucky me.  I saw that this dryer was one of Amazon&#x27;s Deals of the Day.  with a big savings.  I&#x27;ve been researching dryers of this type for a while. This more than meets my needs.  I used it immediately to see if it works and does, very well</li>
    <li> I got this for myself, but for some reason it had a sort of straightening effect on my hair. I always air dry it to get it curly; all hair dryers do this. I had high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t keep mine curly. I wouldn&#x27;t use my hair to judge because its only semi curly. Mine is blond, thin, and fine. I will stick to air drying my own when I want it curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find a PERFECT use for it. My little girl has really fine super curly hair and she is a little scared of hair dryers. I wouldn&#x27;t use it often for her, but on special occasions, this is perfect for kids (with an adult using it!!). It barely seems to get hot at all. It is not super loud and it does not blow frighteningly hard.  There is no fear of burning her at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far n my curls  look nice n bouncy</li>
    <li> Wonderful, use it everyday after spraying hair.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is ok.  I thought I would like it based on the reviews, but it really does not perform.  I have thick shoulder length curly hair.  It leaves my hair looking brittle and it takes forever to get it dry.  It is also quite heavy and large.  It takes up more room in my suitcase than my old regular dryer.  I just bought a more expensive dryer with a diffuser attachment and that works so much better.  Save your money and get a regular hair dryer with a diffuser.</li>
    <li> I have thick,natural curly hair and want to dry it without having to use the flat iron at times. This dryer works perfectly on my hair. I use a mousse and tousle my hair with my fingers while using the dryer. It works quickly and does not damage my hair. I am not sure that this would be a great dryer for fine hair, but it works great on my thicker hair. I am very happy with this dryer and would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This dryer is designed to dry curly hair without blowing out the curl, but I used it to dry my ever-so slightly wavy hair to maximize volume. Even without the attachment, it does build volume if you just scrunch the hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to,get nearly as hot as my regular dryer, but it only took slightly longer to dry my hair. The real usefulness of this dryer, though, is to dry hair that has been rolled damp into Velcro rollers. That is,the longest lasting way to body into my baby fine hair, and no damage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. This hair dryer actually made my hair frizzier than my normal hair dryer with a diffuser on it. This &amp;#34;pancake&amp;#34; style dryer is awkward to handle and use. I regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift from Santa and I love it!!  Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> I received this product in August and after several months of use am ready to submit a review.  It is quite obvious that Conair hasn&#x27;t the slightest idea what is meant by diffused air.  This was advertised as a diffuser blow dryer.  My previous diffuser was a Vidal Sassoon diffuser dryer.  The drying speed was much slower, this is not, even on the slower speed.  The air was not as hot, this is hotter.  If I wanted to blow out all of my curls, I would have purchased a regular dryer with all of the attachments.  If I could find the Vidal Sassoon diffuser dryer again, I would purchase it immediately, throw this in the trash where it belongs, and not bemoan the $40 I wasted.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really understand this. Maybe the ways of the old prehistoric drying contraptions have been ingrained in my brain and I just can&#x27;t get behind this new gadget. Not for me.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of having a full-on diffuser.  It works well, but I have found that my fine, slightly wavy, long hair curls better if assisted by a small round brush, and left slightly damp.  So, I have to use 2 tools; a blow-dryer that really blows air fast, and a diffuser for lift in the back of the head.  But not until it is dry, because that zaps out all the moisture, and makes frizz.  I would say a person who will benefit from this product is someone with thick, healthy, curly hair...  My locks only stay in if they are not messed with very much.  Great product, wrong person.</li>
    <li> I have Type 2C \\&quot;Wavy\\&quot; hair.  It is pretty easy to work with: except in the summer-time and when my head sweats. I&#x27;ll work to get my short-length hair (cut in a pretty pronounced asymmetrical cut) to behave with a flat-iron, and, if it&#x27;s a humid day in Ohio or I have a hot flash, my hair goes *SPROING*, and I&#x27;m left with a real mess.  So, on humid days and many other days of the year, I like to style it so that it&#x27;s got a \\&quot;beachy\\&quot;-soft and wavy look.  It&#x27;s much easier with the right type of hair dryer.  A traditional \\&quot;gun\\&quot;-style hair dryer blows all the wave out.  This Conair Curl Fusion has a more diffuse stream of warm air, and it helps protect your curls as you dry.  When my hair is just-out-of-the-shower, cleaned with a specific-for-curly-hair shampoo, I wrap it in a microfiber towel after blotting it dry (don&#x27;t rub!)--another great way to protect my curls.  Then, when I&#x27;m ready to style, I use my product and this dryer, scrunching and pushing my hair the way I want it to go.  When my hair is completely dried, I have a \\&quot;beachy\\&quot;-soft wavy look.  When I use my \\&quot;gun\\&quot; style dryer, I use a flat-iron and get a completely different look.  I actually prefer the \\&quot;beachy\\&quot;-soft wavy look. It looks messy and feminine and soft around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  This hair dryer is pretty quiet and doesn&#x27;t run super-hot.  It has a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button, as most hair dryers do.  It dries my thick hair more quickly than my \\&quot;gun\\&quot;-style dryer.  I think the ceramic technology might be hype, but, then again, maybe my hair appears somewhat shinier because it hasn&#x27;t been blasted with hurricane-strength, super-heated air. The diffuser attachment acts like lots of fingers and is great for scrunching my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  The cord is shorter than most hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty happy with this.  If you like your hair&#x27;s curls, you might like Curl Fusion.</li>
    <li> The minute I took this hair dryer out of the box I knew it was gonna be tough for me to give it more then 2 stars!  Seriously... the cord is so short I couldn&#x27;t plug it in and easily use it for any length of time w/o turning my body towards the outlet to get the other side of my head.  I was shocked that the designer of this hairdryer couldn&#x27;t add another 1 1/2 feet to the cord.  From there, I felt like this hair dryer was just another ploy for someone to purchase yet another gadget to dry their hair and keep the curl.  A simple attachment to your current hairdryer would do the job.  I found this hairdryer to not do any better then my current hairdryer w/ the attachment.  Waste of time and space in the bathroom drawer is my thought!  Pass....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got thick heavy hair that curls more when long than when short.  I just got it cut and so was looking for a dryer that would help pump up my curl; sadly, this dryer didn&#x27;t enhance my curl at all.  That said, it was a very quiet dryer and I liked the wide open shape which helped dry my hair faster than my normal dryer.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the length of the cord, though I am fortunate enough to have a counter height outlet next to my bathroom vanity.  I tried the diffuser attachment and wanted to love it, but I did notice a lot of air escaping through the open sides because the device doesn&#x27;t seal to the dryer.  Overall a great dryer especially for travel because it packs so small, but I&#x27;m not sure how much it helps with the curls.</li>
    <li> We got this for my daughter because she has very thick, wavy, curly hair and this will allow her to dry it without removing all the curl. She is about 13 and used it when we first got it to get her hair dry. Although it helped to gently dry her hair, it did take a while to get it dry and in fact she kind of gave up trying to get it completely dry, because it just was taking too long. So although the dryer does help maintain your curls while drying your hair, it gives up drying power in the process. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if a normal dryer on a lower heat setting wouldn&#x27;t get the same results.</li>
    <li> My jew-fro&#x27;ed boyfriend and I love this hairdryer. My waves turn out perfect and his fro is less frizzy and we get to dry it before work.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer.  I can usually get a really good curl from my old hair dryer, but this one is a little better.  I like that it is light and easy to use.  I like the shape/design of the hair dryer, it is easy to manager with long curly hair.  Not to mention that purple is my favorite color.</li>
    <li> Great for short hair when you want to have some wave.</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer works great!  Just like the previous one that I used for years.  I would recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about is if you have long hair it kinda gets sucked in the back, where the air comes in.</li>
    <li> this replaced the one i had before works well</li>
    <li> I have super curly/kinky hair and I do not like the diffusers you add on to your hairdryer that look like a mushroom or a megaphone. Saw this dryer, ordered it and it is great! Never had a problem with a Conair so I felt confident ordering it and I was right!</li>
    <li> I returned this item after one use.  Way too windy for curly hair.  It needs separate heat and wind speed settings.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy to kinky hair and like to wear it curly.  I have a straightening iron, but my hair is resistant and I prefer it curly most of the time.  The best curls result from air drying but my hair holds water all day and makes me cold and I hate to be cold.  I already had a working version of this dryer and can&#x27;t remember if my first one died or what its fate was.  I have even taken mine to my stylist to use on my hair after a cut. I bought the additional one because Conair had quit making this model once and I didn&#x27;t want the one I had to die and leave me without the ability to get another. Also it was on cyber deal.  And it is now ionic and ceramic, and I just couldn&#x27;t resist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer does the best job of preserving my curls while drying my hair than any blow dryer/diffuser combination I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not as good as air drying, but the next best thing. Noise level is moderate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- use fingers, no comb or brush&lt;br /&gt;- bend over and direct air flow to the roots&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t try to completely dry hair, you&#x27;ll lose curls. I&#x27;ve found the heat and air are enough to start the drying process, lifting the sodden strands enough to let the under bits dry on their own.&lt;br /&gt;- dryer is light weight and easy to hold, unlike some dryer/diffuser combos that are nearly too long to fit with my arm fully extended. the tips of the diffuser part can be used to separate strands.&lt;br /&gt;- scrunching is highly overrated.  Your hand blocks the airflow.  I twirl strands along a finger, or just lift and blow.&lt;br /&gt;- leave in conditioner and a curl activator and/or styling product give the best results, otherwise I find my hair looks dry and frizzy, not glossy and curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The missing part that would make this the best curly hair dryer ever is dual voltage for travel.  Possibly make it quieter. Then it would be a 6 star product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was tired of all of the heat damage from my regular hair dryer that blew my hair all over the place. I bought this knowing that diffusing dryers spread out the heat, and this dries my hair in half the time. It doesnt leave it hard either like some other diffusing driers I&#x27;ve used. I would recommend this to people with delicate hair or with curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a High and Low setting, and a Cool button as well. The attachment is great for getting close to the scalp without burning yourself, and for adding volume.</li>
    <li> I have very long curly hair and revelry broke the diffusing plate on my old hair dryer. I like this hair dryer and it dries my hair well. I wish the diffusing plate was a concave shape so that it would catch my curls as opposed to me having to lay my curls on the diffuser plate otherwise they don&#x27;t fall within the diffusing plate and don&#x27;t get dried.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and was excited to see if this would enhance those natural waves.  I tried it with and without the diffuser, which is easy to attach.  With the diffuser, I found that my hair got more volume, but unfortunately it also became frizzier, rather than having more wave or curl-- and once I brushed it to tame the frizz, I lost the volume.  I like this much better without the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself has two heat settings, in addition to a cool setting.  It&#x27;s quieter than most hair dryers, and it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as most do.  I could hold it right up close to my scalp on the higher heat setting, and not feel burned by it.  I loved how fast it dried my hair; because the surface area of the dryer is probably 3 times a regular blow drier, it dried my hair more than twice as fast as my regular dryer.  It left my hair very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if this was just a regular dryer that didn&#x27;t purport to enhance natural curl, I&#x27;d have given it four stars, taking one star off for the diffuser. But because it didn&#x27;t live up to this expectation, I gave it three.  Overall, the unfulfilled curl enhancement promise and the diffuser aside, I like it very much as a blow dryer and will probably use it rather my regular dryer.</li>
    <li> I have wavy rather than curly hair but wanted to give this a try to preserve the waves without having to air dry my hair. This dryer worked well for that purpose. The dryer is noticeably gentler in drying my hair than other dryers without sacrificing drying time. It is well-made but still lightweight so not a strain to hold and use. I do think this could use a longer cord and I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to effectively use the diffuser, but I attribute that to user error. Otherwise this is a great all-around dryer for all hair types, not just curly or wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Great service. So happy to find this item.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair without blowing it out.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works well as advertised but it is a little heavy to maneuver.  It has prongs which you can clip onto the dryer.  They don&#x27;t do much for my short hair but they might work fine for long hair.  It has two heats.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I wish I had one of these sooner.  Natural curly hair is awesome once you embrace it.  This dryer doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and does exactly as it is advertised to do. The nubs do the work I normally do with my own fingers and a regular dryer. It&#x27;s silly not to have one of these if you have curly hair!  Just get it!  :)</li>
    <li> My wife Christine loves getting new beauty toys and this Conair brand of ionic ceramic hair dryer is a cool gadget. The first thing we noticed was how light it is compared to those big bulky hair dryers you&#x27;re used to. Not this one. And lest you think it lacks the power of the bigger predecessors, don&#x27;t worry. This bad boy does the trick to dry and style your hair. GET IT!</li>
    <li> An update of the one I have used for 25 years.  All the improvements are excellent.  Know this one will last just as long.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled through the winter with my hair since the curls go away and leave me with wavy, flat hair, despite all the curly products I had tried.  Not any more since I got this hair dryer. I flip my wet head down, lightly dry it all over, bring my head back up, and arrange the curls that have appeared!  It&#x27;s amazing. My husband got the idea after I had dried my hair in front of a quartz heater we had going in the kitchen.  When I stood up, we noticed the curls had popped out - not what I was expecting! But I loved it, so my husband got online to search for a hair dryer for curly hair and found this one!  Now I don&#x27;t have to wait for warm weather for my curls to return.</li>
    <li> Loved the attachment ti lift hair.  Could have been a bit quieter but overall a great product.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works great on my short curly hair...Would recommend it to anyone, my boyfriend ordered one also.&lt;br /&gt;Ive been looking around for just the right one and found it thanks...beyond my expetations</li>
    <li> I acquired wavy hair after giving birth to my daughter (EVERYTHING changes) and have since either found the need to straighten it or just let it air dry. I saw this as a deal of the hour on Amazon and scooped it up. I&#x27;m not sure that I see a huge difference though. The heat setting is much cooler than a normal hair dryer and I feel like it takes way longer for my hair to dry with this. I think I&#x27;ll need to play around with it for a while longer. I give it a B- for now.</li>
    <li> I returned the hair dryer.  I had nothing against the hair dryer, except I have a disability and it was too heavy for me.</li>
    <li> The Conair Curl Fusion works well.  The quality of the item is good.  I would have liked an even lower heat level.  I use it sometimes only.  If you like curly hair than use it for a short time and let your hair air dry the rest of the time.</li>
    <li> This is just very &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t love it but I so seldom style my hair needing a dryer like this, that I wasn&#x27;t going to spend much money on one.  It is noisy and barely satisfies my needs.  Probably should have sent it back.........</li>
    <li> Perfect for curly hair</li>
    <li> this is the best dryer I have ever used. If you have curly hair this is for you.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this diffuser.  This Conair diffuser replaces a 20 year old Conair diffuser that I loved.  Why would I try another brand if my old diffuser by Conair lasted so long?  I really like the choice of low or high settings and the cool blast option on this.&lt;br /&gt;If you are &amp;#34;on the fence&amp;#34; about which diffuser to try, give this one a try.  The price, quality and workmanship on this diffuser will fantastic!</li>
    <li> Works well and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have owned several of these diffuser dryers in the past 10 years or so.  This dryer has 1800 watts! Most other diffuser dryers have a maximum 1200 watts, which is not enough to dry thick curly hair.  Conair doesn&#x27;t offer this dryer on their website, and the only source I found was Amazon.  I ordered four of them!  This is the best dryer I have found for drying my hair and actually keeping my curls curly and not frizzy.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, and that is why I don&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair that is to the middle of my back. I LOVE this hair dryer! It has cut my drying time in half. My hand does not get tired from moving it all over my head like my traditional dryer did. My sister n law has naturally curly hair as well and I will be getting her one for her.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and for those of us with curly hair know that regular dryers really frizz out our hair. I try to stay away from drying my hair with a hair dryer as much as possible. My curls look best when they are let to air dry; however, there are times when I really need to dry my hair quickly. This dryer works great. It&#x27;s really not noisy which is great when something is right by your ear. It has a very wide drying surface and I use it with the curl diffusing attachment. What is great about it is that it really diffuses the airflow wonderfully and with the attachment, you can get into the hair without blowing it all over the place. For the price, this dryer is perfect!</li>
    <li> Not the greatest for curly frizzy hair</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel hair dryer and it works very well.  It doesn&#x27;t cause frizz and dried my hair pretty quickly.  I will say the cord is a bit short but not too short use.</li>
    <li> Works great, actuall better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it came in a different color(s) like black for guys..,&lt;br /&gt;Actually dries my hair 8 min faster then the other look a like dryer I was using,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast</li>
    <li> I recently had an American Wave (type of perm) done to my very straight hair.  Because I never needed a diffuser before, all the attachment were donated or trashed in my house.  Needing something to dry my new curly hair, I took a chance on this because it was not expensive and it was supposed to do exactly what I needed- drying without frizz.  While I am still new to styling curly hair, I think this diffuser works great.  I am not the most experienced person when it comes to styling, but I have been able to create soft, manageable curls and waves using this so I am sure it is doing the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is not the best quality dryer (I have much nicer ones..) I&#x27;m definitely happy with the performance and the outcome.  Other reviewers have commented on the length and curl pattern of their hair making a difference.  I have 2B in a medium length and thickness and it seems to be fine for me!</li>
    <li> So disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t work for my naturally curly/wavy hair. I have to use a diffuser to get my curls to spring up, instead of flatten out when air drying. The dryer looks really cool but there is no diffusion &amp;#34;filter&amp;#34; between the dryer and the diffuser attachment. So it just blows too hard with direct application, even on low setting. My hair turns into a frizzy mess. The diffuser attaches with difficulty to the dryer, you have to push hard to get it to snap. My short-term fix is zipping a dryer bag (Like the mesh ones you dry delicates in) around it to diffuse the &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; more. But I&#x27;ll have to purchase another diffuser and now I&#x27;ve got this HUGE dryer that won&#x27;t fit any standard diffusers, dang!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  As a curly girl, it seems to be the perfect hair dryer for someone needing a diffuser. Lightweight, quiet, and just so cute...makes it a winner for me!  The problem was 1) after only 4 months, it would only run on the low setting, even when I switched it to high, and 2) after about 1 1/2 year the &amp;#34;circuit breaker&amp;#34; on the plug refused to reset and it would no longer turn on.  So, I enjoyed using it until it started to break down on me.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan - pardon the pun. It works okay for my wavy to curly hair.</li>
    <li> Great for curly girls.  Great price. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer.  This hair dryer works really well.  In fact, it will probably get used until it literally wears out.  I am a fan of things like these.  Blow dryer, curling irons, straighteners, etc. get used at my house.  And with 3 girls (in addition to me), there are always lots of these type of things around.  So when this blow dryer came in the mail, my girls were ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the older I get, the more tired I get; therefore, I don&#x27;t use these type of things quite as often as I did when I was in my 20&#x27;s.  But I do still use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you use these type of products.</li>
    <li> BEST BLOW DRYER EVER FOR CURLY HAIR!!!!!!  I MODIFIED THE DIFFUSER PART WITH A OLD DIFFUSER TO MAKE MORE OF A CUP, BECAUSE MY HAIR IS LONG AND THICK AND CRAZY.  MY HAIR HAS NEVER LOOKED BETTER...SERIOUSLY.  ALSO IT&#x27;S SMALL, SO TRAVELS BETTER THEN MY LAST DRYER..TAKES UP LITTLE TO NO SPACE.  ONLY BAD THING, WAS I WISHED IT HAD A COOL SETTING INSTEAD OF HOLDING BUTTON DOWN TO HAVE COOL SETTING.</li>
    <li> Never used a diffuser before, this is awesome. Makes my curls look amazing and it doesn&#x27;t heat up too much or makes too much noise.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for curly hair.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.  I have curly hair and blow dryers, even with diffusers, make my hair frizzy.  This one doesn&#x27;t. I had a con air before similar to this that finally died after years of use.  I was afraid I would not be able to find another one like it but here it is!!!! This one is even better than my old one because it&#x27;s ceramic.  I hope I get as many years out of it as I did my old one!</li>
    <li> While not as small as some travel size hair dryers, this packs very well.  It works well on my short curly hair, diffusing the air flow so there is minimal frizz. I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these Conair dryers because they are hard to find, my wife is very happy with this product :)</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to the crappy plastic diffuser I already have and this is not it.  I swear the air flow from this thing is stronger than my old dryer WITHOUT the diffuser on it.  Returning.</li>
    <li> A must for curly hair-- you will not use any other blow dryer--even with a diffuser. This is it.</li>
    <li> This is the best diffuser I&#x27;ve ever owned. I love the shape and the way this product dries my hair without making it frizzy or messing up the shape of my curls. I also really appreciate the detachable diffuser piece that comes with it. My only complaint is that the cord is too short for my liking.</li>
    <li> This is great for travel. It&#x27;s flat so it packs easily. It works well for my wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I am literally writing this review after using the dryer for the first time ever. EURÊKA!!! I have been doing the natural, curly girl method for about 2 months with sad results and I was about ready to give up. My hair has multiple personalities.  It is naturally wavy for the most part, but  looser waves on top and with tighter curl at the nape of my neck, but very frizzy and also takes an eternity to dry, even when using a microfiber towel. Air drying took hours and the end result was inconstant and/or messy.Then I found this dryer. I am soo in love.  It dried my hair very easily without giving me thespongy hair I get if I attattempted to use a regular dryer. My waves are soft, bouncy and shiny. No more guessing games about how my hair will dry or how long it will take, and I can better control my wave pattern and style without the fear of looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket. LOVE, LOVE LOVE.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the item I ordered.</li>
    <li> Perfect for men and women with long, straight hair, TOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bend forward and dry the back of your head as much as you need and the rest will be dry too when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t make hair frizzy. Give lots of volume. The end results are great curls to beachy waves. Works well on natural curly and permed hair. The only downside....the cord could be longer. Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my purchase. The Curl Fusion met all my expectations. I would compare it to the old &amp;#34;Curly Top&amp;#34; dryer but better!</li>
    <li> This does a great job! I have thick curly hair and my hair looks good. I gave it four instead of five because it would have been better if it were larger n more powerful for all my hair.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this purchase! I have thin, soft, shoulder length, wavy hair with some loose curls around my face.  I had been using an old Conair with the cup style diffuser that came with it, but I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded.  The spiky diffuser holds my hair rather than me having to scrunch and burn my fingers while trying to encourage my curls to dry nice and sproingy.  I have gotten several unsolicited comments about my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this dryer, and can definitely recommend it.  I do use gel, which helps with the flyaways.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Can&#x27;t really say to much. Don&#x27;t think I could figure out how to use it w/o contending with the frizzy&#x27;s and wild hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never going to own any other hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Compared to my regular 1800 watt all purpose blow dryer with a diffuser, this Conair dryer is quieter, not as hot and has a wider area of air distribution. It&#x27;s not so powerful so as to blow your curls around vigorously and turn them into a frizzy nest. I got shiny, soft, frizz free curl definition and volume with this Ionic Ceramic Styler Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the flat diffuser attachment to cradle my shoulder length curls. I&#x27;m not sure how it would handle longer length curly hair. If you you dry your hair with it flipped upside down for volume this dryer is so much easier to manage than the regular dryer. Overall it&#x27;s nice and works well, but a concentrater attachment would be helpful for the option of blow drying your curls straight too. It doesn&#x27;t seem as sturdy as most dryers, only time will tell how this dryer holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very specialized for the curly heads or someone that wants a slower dry to allow natural curls and waves to rule. So if you are a curl aficianado and follow the curly rules to \\&quot;Stick with the low and medium settings for temperature and air\\&quot; prescribed by the high priestess of curls, Ouidad, then this IS the dryer for you!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I thought I was going to be disappointed yet again as so many products claim to be for curly hair, but, I needed something other than my stand up bonnet hair dryer.  Maybe this time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, time! Huzzah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was it&#x27;s heavier weight.  But this is necessary to accommodate the larger area of the blow dryer &amp;#34;mouth&amp;#34;.  There is also a &amp;#34;diffuser&amp;#34;, but actually, it acts as a curl separator, and for me, a guide so I didn&#x27;t place the dryer too close to the scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical blow dryers use a small aperture of air, about 2 inches in diameter at the mouth, and you pop on the diffuser.  Conair had the smarts to have a 1:1 ratio, where the diameter of the blower is equal to the diffuser.  There is a greater surface of air coming out, so it doesn&#x27;t get funneled.  How logical is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a curlygirl, I  tend to need to have my hair soaking wet and have product in my hair, so when I turned the dryer on, I smelled fabulously pungent ionic air which speeds up the dying time.  I don&#x27;t understand the technology, so I don&#x27;t know if that is something that can be used up, or wear out, but for now, it is super, and truly hope Conair built it with longevity in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 4+ star item after initial use.  I have a learning curve on how to best use this dryer, but I am now free to travel from my house knowing I have a portable dryer that does the job.  Buy this and try it for yourselves.</li>
    <li> Best dryer to keep my natural curls soft and bouncy!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was the equivalent to standing next to a dryer at the car wash. It blows air out so hard, even on the low setting, that I was left with GIANT frizzy hair that could only be tamed by washing it out and starting over again. the diffuser needs to have a bowl shape in order to hold the hair. I did like how small and light the dryer is. It&#x27;s being shipped back today.....</li>
    <li> Too heavy and really doesn&#x27;t promote any curls</li>
    <li> Great product for my curly hair!! It has 2 heat settings and button for just air, no heat.  It is so much lighter than the standard dryers with a diffuser attachment. I had a dryer like this many years ago and am so glad to have found one again.</li>
    <li> Great for curls even in winter.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Works great!!!!</li>
    <li> I use a diffuser on my large hair dryer.  Hate to have to carry it on a trip.  This is the perfect solution--teeth are a little shorter but works well.  Size makes it practical for travel.</li>
    <li> Love it!  This is a great dryer for curly hair - it&#x27;s basically a big diffuser without that stupid sock or diffuser attachment that always falls off a typical hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great!!! I&#x27;ve been having scalp issues for many years after trying the &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; method of hair care. For the past few years I was using a diffuser attachment on a regular hairdryer that was so huge I couldn&#x27;t maneuver it around my head. With this snub nose style I can easily dry my roots cutting down the dampness on my scalp (naturally occurring scalp yeast breed in wet places). I use the cool air button for most of the root drying. The only con (which another reviewer mentioned) is that your thumb gets tired holding the cool button down. Still, this dryer is the best.</li>
    <li> This seemed like a really great idea, and I love how light it is in comparison to the two blowdryers I currently use (a Sedu Revolution and a [[ASIN:B000R810A4 Inifiniti by Conair 228 Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic Styler, White]]), but it doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, if you have curly or wavy hair, you know that a blow dryer that blows the hair around causes frizz.  A deep bowl diffuser will usually cup the hair so that it doesn&#x27;t move too much.  This Conair dryer puts out too much air, even on the low setting, so that your hair gets blown about, and gets frizzier and frizzier.  I&#x27;ve tried it both with and without the extra attachment, and have had the same problem each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second main problem is that the attachment doesn&#x27;t hold your hair if it&#x27;s long.  The two other diffusers I have create enough depth for me to place my mid-back hair in them to dry.  The Conair one would work great if you had shorter hair that is perhaps above your shoulders, but for longer hair, it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as a regular dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, as I mentioned above, it is lightweight, and it has two settings:  high and low.  It also has a cold shot button so you can lock in your style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good idea in theory, but just doesn&#x27;t work as well in practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 4-30-14:  For the last few months, I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B00H2T4PR6 DevaCurl DevaFuser Hair Dryer Diffuser]] as my diffuser, and I love it! It leaves my curls frizz-free, and dries them pretty quickly.  It&#x27;s also come down in price since it first came out.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend the DevaFuser over this!</li>
    <li> My daughter and sister both have naturally curly hair. My daughter uses regular shampoos/conditioners that include silicones and sulfates. She used this dryer on her hair and it dried it without disrupting her natural curls and no frizz.  My sister uses only sulfate free \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; products on her hair, only towel/air dries to avoid frizz and she also used this dryer and now wants one of her own. I was surprised because my sister has not used a dryer in many years because she can&#x27;t find one that&#x27;s affordable that will only dry her hair without frizz. They were both very impressed with this dryer. I did not try it myself because my hair is straight.</li>
    <li> Just to be clear, this dryer does the job.  It&#x27;s just not an optimum design.  Somehow, I get the impression this wasn&#x27;t tested with unbiased women.  Here&#x27;s why I mark it down:&lt;br /&gt;-  It&#x27;s loud.  My 30+ year old Curly Top dryer was quieter.  Unfortunately, it recently broke.&lt;br /&gt;-  There&#x27;s no air movement in the middle.  The Conair logo blocks air flow and it&#x27;s noticeable.  I compensate by slightly rotating at the handle.&lt;br /&gt;-  The cord is annoyingly short.  It&#x27;s barely long enough for me to use while I bend over to give my hair a little lift at the roots.  I can only imagine what it might be like for others who don&#x27;t have a conveniently placed outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the handle is comfortable and the controls don&#x27;t interfere with my grip.  The temperature settings are comfortable.  It appears to be reasonably sturdy.  If you need a dryer like this for curly hair, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  It will do its job.  You&#x27;re just not likely to rave about it.</li>
    <li> I like this difuser/dryer, but it is louder than I expected.  It replaces one I&#x27;d had for decades that was much quieter.</li>
    <li> I have short straight hair. This dryer is relatively small and provides enough drying power to do what I need quickly without adding a diffuser attachment.</li>
    <li> Thi is a good product I loved</li>
    <li> Just okay. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power, and the attachment falls off easily, but it is compact and eventually gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Oh my god. I cannot rave about this enough. I got it yesterday after two days from when I ordered it. I just used it today when I got out of the shower after drying it with a cotton t shirt. My curls usually end up stretched out and turn into waves and a lot of frizz. With this, there was no extreme heat like with a blow dryer. Just enough to dry your hair and not burn your scalp. My curls came out so beautiful and soft and shiny. And no frizz!!!! It&#x27;s sooooooo easy to use and pretty cheap! Couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and this dryer is perfect for no &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the type I&#x27;m used to. Just wish the cord was longer.</li>
    <li> Knew I&#x27;d love it because I had one before.</li>
    <li> Love it! Perfect for wavy hair.</li>
    <li> My wife has been perfectly satisfied with this unit. I picked up some brownie points finding it for her.</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer for curly hair--doesn&#x27;t straighten it or make the hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations!  I have used a diffuser on a regular blow dryer before and this hair dryer works much better and faster!! On the days I don&#x27;t want to straighten my curly hair with round brush and hair dryer, using this hair dryer makes my curls shiny and full of volume. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to turn 30-years old and BARELY embracing my natural curls. I did my research and went for this little guy. I LOVE it! It&#x27;s easy to use, and my hair turns out nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I stay away from hair dryers, for the most part, because they leave my hair wild and  frizzy. This one sounded like it might work a little better with the ionic feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is quiet and the cool feature helps with the frizz.  I just haven&#x27;t been able to get the hang of the \\&quot;difuser\\&quot;. I keep whacking my skull. I think it would work better if you have very long, curly hair. Can&#x27;t really pick up shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Conair Curl Fusion Ionic Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer is quieter than my wife&#x27;s last hair dryer which was promoted as being very quiet.  This hair dryer has a much larger fan area than her previous hair dryer.  She has not noticed any difference in the quality of the drying.  She does feel that some way of narrowing the air flow to direct it to more specific areas would be handy.  Overall she is happy with the dryer and hopes that the ceramic heating really does cause less hair damage.  Oh, it does include a volumizing attachment that she said would only work with hair longer than hers.  I guess the biggest reason I like it is that it is quieter.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;After using this for awhile my wife loves the color and the quietness but she feels that this dryer does not work well with short hair.  She tried it without the defuser thing and then she couldn&#x27;t find a good way to lay it down when it was running.  She still thinks it is a nice dryer but more appropriate for someone with long hair.</li>
    <li> Since my hair is short these days, I turned to my stepmom to help me review this hair dryer. Simply put, she was blown away! Easy to use, it curled her hair in no time flat, just a few minutes worth and her long, dark locks were right where she wanted them. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot and has a cooling button, and even the noise is not that loud. We&#x27;re both duly impressed--well don Conair.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair with loose curls. My curls are not tight and well defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this product worked well. I used my normal gel(the pink stuff I get at Walmart for cheap) and scrunched my hair as I normally did. Then I tried to keep my hands off my hair(which is always hard to do). I noticed that it curled my hair well, but I was a little frizzier than normal. Still, it wasn&#x27;t an issue for me. I tried it a few more times and with the same results. My hair looked nice, but I like my conair hair dryer better. So I will be using that one instead. But this is a nice little product and smaller than a big hairdryer. I would take it with me on trips so I can get nice curls because those hotel hairdryers mutilate my hair.</li>
    <li> It is great; light weight travels nicely in gym bag. Has two airs speeds and temps so dries my curls without flattening them. All at a great price</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. . .cord is too short. . .&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off with a regular dryer and a wide diffuser.</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer for curly hair.  It is very hard to find.  I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries it and the price is great!</li>
