      <li>Helps to work the product into your skin for easy absorption!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this milk hydrating treatment.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>If you love the face products you need to try the argan oil body butter.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t it just  break me out more.</li>
      <li>and this stuff dries it out even more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try using it again to make sure</li>
      <li>I bought mine at Sephora and love it.  </li>
      <li>Found this one to be a rip off, I usually love Josie Maran products.</li>
      <li>and this is more like glue</li>
      <li>I notice the different in my face...is great!</li>
      <li>I saw my fine lines disappear with first use!!!</li>
      <li>works fine.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t sound like this buyer is trustworthy from the reviews here.  </li>
      <li>I was also really happy with the individual I purchased it from.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light oil</li>
      <li>This is not anywhere close to the original product.</li>
      <li>Works great and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s great for my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Like others have commented, this one is bright white and like elmer&#x27;s glue.  </li>
      <li>This is better than the Lancome products I&#x27;ve used which cost twice as much.</li>
      <li>I bought this product several times before and loved it.  </li>
      <li>When I first started using the product I had fine lines around my eyes, mouth and lips that have now vanished.</li>
      <li>My skin felt better instantly and looked much better within two days.</li>
      <li>All of Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil products are superior to all other brands.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, light moisturizer, but not really anything that special to warrant the high price, so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
      <li>Even my neck, which at age 50 had begun to look like crepe paper, looks smooth and young.</li>
      <li>I AM VERY CONCERNED!  </li>
      <li>Love always Josie Moran products,  this new one I&#x27;ve been using a short time and found a nice softness to my face, especially during these  winter months with dryness from the heat in your home.</li>
      <li>Less greasy than your typical argan oil and the milk is a great vehicle for application!</li>
      <li>I have used this one before and although it is touted as a miracle worker, I would just as soon use the 100% pure argan oil in the brown bottle.  </li>
      <li>It really makes your skin feel super soft after just one use.</li>
      <li>People I work with were shock when I told them my real age.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any difference after using.</li>
      <li>Really works.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this as I also use her 100% pur argan oil.</li>
      <li>Wow!!!  </li>
      <li>Amazing...everything I love for the face...delicate, absorbs perfectly, not greasy, light clean feel.  </li>
      <li>IT is the ONLY product that I can use on my skin that doesn&#x27;t break me out and keeps my skin  soft, oil free and radiant all day.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this one, there are better options.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Product in this particular bottle is  bright white like elmers glue and so thick you can&#x27;t even use the dropper to get anything out.  </li>
      <li>It got a strange texture after a few weeks, and to be honest does not moisturize well at all.</li>
      <li>The attached picture shows the white bottle on left, a new bottle on the right just purchased from a well known cosmetic store.</li>
      <li>keep  my skin supple, soft and radiant.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>It can&#x27;t possibly  be the real product.  </li>
      <li>Argan oil face cleanser so far.</li>
      <li>As far as oils or moisturizers go, I am not a fan of this one.  </li>
      <li>I have recently tried a lot of new products.  </li>
      <li>Im constantly  touch my skin and amazed at how soft it feels.</li>
      <li>No heavy perfume smell, no oily shine, keeps your skin hydrated all day long.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the real product before, it should be a slight yellow color, somewhat liquid</li>
      <li>I have very dry mature skin</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this milk hydrating treatment.  You can literally see it working as you put it on your face.  Smoothing lines and plumping skin.  My skin is so beautiful after I use this.  I won&#x27;t be using any other moisturizer after trying Josie Maran&#x27;s argan milk.  It is the perfect product!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product several times before and loved it.  Like others have commented, this one is bright white and like elmer&#x27;s glue.  It&#x27;s extremely hard to get the dropper to grab it.  It makes me think this one is fake!</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. My skin felt better instantly and looked much better within two days. I can&#x27;t believe how youthful and glowing my skin looks! Even my neck, which at age 50 had begun to look like crepe paper, looks smooth and young. This is better than the Lancome products I&#x27;ve used which cost twice as much. Try it!</li>
    <li> Found this one to be a rip off, I usually love Josie Maran products. It got a strange texture after a few weeks, and to be honest does not moisturize well at all. Save your money!</li>
    <li> So moisturizing!  It&#x27;s a light oil that&#x27;s great for my dry skin.  It is oil though and I find any mascara I wear runs</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any difference after using. The product starts smelling a bit &#x27;off&#x27; after a while, even thought it&#x27;s odorless.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Less greasy than your typical argan oil and the milk is a great vehicle for application! Helps to work the product into your skin for easy absorption! I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I can never say anything bad about Josie Maran  products because they truly deliver. I have been using her products for 3 years. I just turn 50 this year. People I work with were shock when I told them my real age. They thought I was in my late 30&#x27;s or early  40&#x27;s. Josie  Maran products  keep  my skin supple, soft and radiant. When I first started using the product I had fine lines around my eyes, mouth and lips that have now vanished. My skin is oily and proned to break outs. I initially thought who would put oil on their skin. Wouldn&#x27;t it just  break me out more. Boy was I  wrong this product actually did the opposite. It cleared up my acne and reduced my oil.  IT is the ONLY product that I can use on my skin that doesn&#x27;t break me out and keeps my skin  soft, oil free and radiant all day. Aragan Milk feels like silk going on my skin. Im constantly  touch my skin and amazed at how soft it feels. I use all off her products  from head to toe and will never  go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> I have recently tried a lot of new products.  As far as oils or moisturizers go, I am not a fan of this one.  I put it on at night and when I woke up my face did not feel moisturized.  It was greasy to the touch almost as if it did not absorb.  I have used Fresh Seaberry Moisturizing Face Oil which I like much better and love the smell, but am still on the hunt for the perfect one.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this one, there are better options.  I do however like her face Argan oil face cleanser so far.</li>
    <li> This is not the correct serum. I&#x27;ve used it for years and this is more like glue and it doesn&#x27;t come in the box that it typically is sold in. It made my face breakout.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!  Really works.  I saw my fine lines disappear with first use!!!</li>
    <li> Buy this at QVC for half the price.  Doesn&#x27;t sound like this buyer is trustworthy from the reviews here.  I bought mine at Sephora and love it.  Its a very nice light weight moisturizer that acts like a serum as well.  No heavy perfume smell, no oily shine, keeps your skin hydrated all day long.  Perfect for applying before makeup or at night with the argan oil.</li>
    <li> I love it! I notice the different in my face...is great!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this as I also use her 100% pur argan oil. This made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed. I&#x27;ll try using it again to make sure my break out wasn&#x27;t caused by something else.</li>
    <li> This is not anywhere close to the original product. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> IT GAVE ME A RASH ALL OVER MY FACE  WHERE I APPLIED IT. DIDN&#x27;T BOTHER TO RETURN IT BUT I SHOULD HAVE FOR THE PRICE. AND YET I USE 100% ARGON OIL WITH OUT ANY PROBLEM. IT MUST BE SOMETHING THEY ADD TO IT.....</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I like almost everything made by Josie.</li>
    <li> Amazing...everything I love for the face...delicate, absorbs perfectly, not greasy, light clean feel.  I want to bathe in it.  They need to sell it in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used this one before and although it is touted as a miracle worker, I would just as soon use the 100% pure argan oil in the brown bottle.  I fear this product may be a bit over-priced and over-rated.</li>
    <li> Love always Josie Moran products,  this new one I&#x27;ve been using a short time and found a nice softness to my face, especially during these  winter months with dryness from the heat in your home.</li>
    <li> I AM VERY CONCERNED!  I am returning this item and will report to Amazon.  It can&#x27;t possibly  be the real product.  Received without box in a plastic bag that had Zany Supplies printed on it in a bubble wrap mailing envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product in this particular bottle is  bright white like elmers glue and so thick you can&#x27;t even use the dropper to get anything out.  I&#x27;ve used the real product before, it should be a slight yellow color, somewhat liquid so you can shake it to mix the oil and the dropper works fine.  The attached picture shows the white bottle on left, a new bottle on the right just purchased from a well known cosmetic store.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice, light moisturizer, but not really anything that special to warrant the high price, so I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It moisturizes without breaking you out. Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. It&#x27;s great to use at night and during the day under sunscreen. Works great and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It really makes your skin feel super soft after just one use. It is bit on the expensive side though. Will wait to see the long term advantages to decide If I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have very dry mature skin and this stuff dries it out even more.  I put it on my face including my lips and my lips were so dry I couldn&#x27;t talk.  Seriously, this stuff is not good!</li>
    <li> This did not look, feel or perform like the samples I got from two different stores. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> All of Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil products are superior to all other brands. If you love the face products you need to try the argan oil body butter. I have had terrible skin issues and this product has saved me.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Argan Milk.  I was also really happy with the individual I purchased it from.</li>
