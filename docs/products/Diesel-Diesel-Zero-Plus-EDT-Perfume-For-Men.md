      <li>The shipping was fast and the price was great-</li>
      <li>Bought this strictly for the look of the packaging (it comes in a glass orb that is quite nifty and desginer label (diesel), one of my favorite brands.  </li>
      <li>Need I say any more?</li>
      <li>The biting cinnamon gave way to a more old-spice type scent.</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>its just ok .</li>
      <li>the description say woodsy aroma but is more like grandma smell.</li>

      <li>plan on buying some more this Christmas</li>
      <li>my best (female) friend helped me select, was about to run out.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne.</li>
      <li>Still better than the one time</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>nothing special , smells good but is not as strong as i thought it will be</li>
      <li>very original.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for many years and would recommend it to anyone who wants to smell good.</li>
      <li>This scent has captivated me for its packaging, delivery of Amazon was accurate, I&#x27;m really pleased and happy for such an effective logistical.</li>
      <li>Great cologne, very warm, powdery, cinnamon heavy, a touch of copper and tin, a bit of vanilla.  </li>
      <li>Really good job and thanks once again.</li>
      <li>Really didnt smell as good as I thought it would but for the price u cant beat it.</li>
      <li>You will read reviews about how this smell is powdery, or has that cinnamon effect, or is strong.</li>
      <li>Extremely strong and industrial smelling.  </li>
      <li>While I really wanted Vintage by John Varvatos, a nice darker and very unique scent, the price tag threw me off.</li>
      <li>cheap for some reason.</li>
      <li>It seems like it was filled with a knock off that smells   obnoxious and unattractive.</li>
      <li>It was a rather great hit of a cologne: reminding me of those sugary Smarties I used to eat as a kid, and my female company of the dark-but-goofy person that I seem to be so often described as.</li>
      <li>I would wear this cologne out and about, but would not wear it to important events or places.</li>
      <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>
      <li>It is soft and deep; excellent and Good quality and price, this fragance worth it and much attitude</li>

      <li>/&gt;Product smells clean and spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this scent, the pure spiciness and warmth reminds me of</li>
      <li>thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
      <li>Haha. :)</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s good enough!</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a Good buy for the price</li>
      <li>The wooden smell was just the way I appreciate and the fixation is quite good as well.</li>
      <li>WILL NEVER BUY COLOGNE in a store again for the simple fact of how fairly priced you can get it for on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That being said, they make some unique and fun scents.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m very glad I made the purchase and would buy it if necessary.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very strong smell, not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of Dr. Pepper, so I&#x27;d recommend it for someone peppy and fun; less for someone who takes themselves seriously.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
    <li> my wife said that this item smelled so good.... she even tried to rape me when i first sprayed it on.... LOL but yea this fragrance is not for everyone its smooth and strong at the same time and it has a hint of a cinamon smell.... but i must say got to your local store and test it out before you buy it... but definatly buy this product from amazon.com its much much cheaper than the store trust me.</li>
    <li> i think they should pay more attention to the quality of the packaging, the sprayer stopped working on the second week, and the bottle is still full.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular cologne practically everyday for the last three years; I bought several vials of it and know the fragrance well.  The container I purchased from this seller was NOT the same cologne!!!  Not even close.  I&#x27;ve bought colognes in the past that have expired and lost their potency, but this is basically apples against oranges.  For only $15, I&#x27;m not too upset, but if you&#x27;re looking for actual Diesel Zero Plus cologne, that isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re going to get.</li>
    <li> Diesel has hit another homerun w/Zero Plus!! My wife loves it, as do randoms.. 2.5oz is alot considering the bottle wasnt even $20!! Deffi will reorder when i run out..</li>
    <li> I love the design of this cologne. The cologne itself is nice, but it has a strong musk and it is almost if the cologne has a bit of a peppery scent. One of my friends said it reminded him of mace. I would wear this cologne out and about, but would not wear it to important events or places.</li>
    <li> excelente producto,llego en perfectas condiciones, responsables, la entrega se realizo en el lapso estimado de fecha de entrega, lo recomiendo absolutamente.</li>
    <li> I was impressed first by the delivery.  I bought it on the 12th and it was delivered by 13th through free shipping option.  I got it for my husband and I am real skeptical because I couldn&#x27;t smell it before purchase. However i like the fragrance.  It has a manly smelly...</li>
    <li> its just ok . nothing special , smells good but is not as strong as i thought it will be</li>
    <li> Diesel Zero Plus is a blast of cinnamon and powder.  It is definitely not for everyone.  The cinnamon and powder smell can be overwhelming at times, but it does last a very long time.  It is definitely a different scent from most mainstream fragrances out there today.  It is more ideal for an autumn or winter scent.  This is one you will want to try it out before you buy it.</li>
    <li> It was not the first time I purchased Diesel Zero.  I have a difficult skin, I mean, several fragances that I like on my friends do not smell quite the same on me or the smell do not stay long enough.  That was not what happened with Diesel Zero. The wooden smell was just the way I appreciate and the fixation is quite good as well. Besides that, the price is very affordable in comparison to other good brands.   I truly recommend you to try it. You won&#x27;t regret it and may even get surprised with the results.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for a butch Marlboro Man scent.&lt;br /&gt;More of a roMANtic, coffee-house guy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little like \\&quot;Tommy\\&quot; by Hilfiger meets \\&quot;Le Male\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;by Gautier; and they adopt a son - lol.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this cologne. I like the smell of it. Also I like the good reaction of some people around me. They keep asking what&#x27;s that you are wearing? So that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s a very good smell. Try it see if you like.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of Diesel, but have tried few and this one is probably the best! However it seems to me that it has some scent which is more feminine kind of thing, so if your man is very picky then just be careful in your choice. It&#x27;s a little bit sweet, just u to know.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing - it stays long!!!! unlike for a fragrance for women I had from Diesel some time ago...</li>
    <li> the description say woodsy aroma but is more like grandma smell. this is a ladies perfume&lt;br /&gt;is cheap for some reason.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this cologne for two years.  The smell is soft and sweet, very romantic.  Every time he puts this on, i literally jump on him and usually, we end up having sex (unless we have be somewhere, and then, we have sex on the way).  He was worried that he wouldn&#x27;t be able to find more, but here it is!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I still have the bottle I&#x27;m replacing (almost out) and the new bottle design font and smell do not match. Avoid at all costs. Would have returned but the product arrived one day after the return cutoff.</li>
    <li> Extremely strong and industrial smelling.  It&#x27;s ok, but not really something that makes you want to snuggle up to your boyfriend.</li>
    <li> I tought would be a better fragance… a bit disapointed. The smell does not match with the name &amp;#34;diesel&amp;#34; .</li>
    <li> This is definitely not the cologne I remember it to be.    It seems like it was filled with a knock off that smells   obnoxious and unattractive.</li>
    <li> This cologne is hard to find in stores at a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NEVER BUY COLOGNE in a store again for the simple fact of how fairly priced you can get it for on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product smells clean and spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and the product was as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying again...this is my third Cologne purchase over the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Not the best product from Diesel...it endures nothing! and the fragrance is very null. i prefer the white bottle! i do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> no wonder it was so cheap !  it&#x27;s worse than the women&#x27;s fragrance !  I used it to cover the smell of my sweatty underwear and socks returning from a trip.  Couldnt say what smelled worse, the dirty clothes or the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This product is not the perfume that i expected... But it&#x27;s ok for the price. I guess it&#x27;s good enough!</li>
    <li> This frange smells like baby powder with a little touch of cinnamon. I only bought to try it, but definitely don&#x27;t smells well</li>
    <li> the product met my expectations, arrived on time, excellent quality, size was the one that was asked, the color was the one asked. keep buying from amazon, thanks.</li>
    <li> spicy gourmand scent.  Its unique like other diesel colognes.  I prefer fuel for life over this one, but zero plus is good too.  It reminds me of a soft cut licorice, with some spicy after notes.  This was one of my first colognes, and took me a while to get through the bottle.  Its a very rich and thick scent, so spray carefully.  Excellent for winter, but may be overpowering in the summer air.</li>
    <li> You will read reviews about how this smell is powdery, or has that cinnamon effect, or is strong. Say whatever, once you develop a taste for it, chances are that whenever you go for your perfume rack, you might end up choosing this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has that fresh masculine smell, which some may find too powerful. It is not the regular perfumes that you might be used to. I for one, have developed a taste and will order it again. Will wear it for myself, if not for others!</li>
    <li> So delicious.  I bought this for a guy friend of mine and omg - what a delicious smell.  Yum-MY.  Go for it.  Give it as a gift.  Spray it on your pillow.  Spray it on your dog.  Just go for it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. It&#x27;s the proper balance of musk and spice for my body. Not too strong, not too soft.</li>
    <li> i love the way it smells, it comes unwrapped, so be careful to keep it wrap so it won&#x27;t loose the smell</li>
    <li> the bottle came with all the paint fading and the smell of the cologne vanish in minutes worst purchase ever</li>
    <li> it did not worth the money paid for it. it was not a good a choice and I will not buy it again</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase!  The company was efficient with their shipping and I got this product for a really great price.  It is one of my favorite scents and I gave it as a gift to my fiance.  This is one of his favorite scents too!</li>
    <li> It smells like an old powdery perfume. Very strong powdery smell.  I couldn&#x27;t give it away!! So I threw it in the trash  :-(</li>
    <li> Smells good, fair price. It was a gift for a friend is happy. But had few details perfume bottle... but cool</li>
    <li> is an acceptable product but the smell does not last nearly, would be good at the time of offer it will describe which is an imitation of the origina</li>
    <li> In terms of clothing, I am not typically a fan of Diesel. That being said, they make some unique and fun scents. Fuel for life is a great all year fruity yet masculine smell that my girlfriend is obsessed with. Out of curiosity I decided to branch out and try the other scents from this brand (plus plus, zero plus, green), opting for this one first due to its enticing packaging and (slightly) cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;Upon first receiving the  cologne, the plain white box it came in was practically falling apart. When i opened it, the plastic dome/cap was a bit scuffed up, but the seal was still intact. Unfortunately, the prongs used to hold the bottle in place had dug into the red matte paint, which while not affecting the usefulness or scent, does make me kinda bummed as it ruins the great look of this package. Anyway, on to the scent. When i first sniffed it i was totally confused. It smelled suspiciously like a hallmark store. That sort of synthetic, warm cinnamon commonly found in candles and chewing gum. While initially, i was put off, i left it on my arm to see where the smell went. To my surprise, about an hour after the spray it changed its character for the better. The biting cinnamon gave way to a more old-spice type scent. Complex in a nostalgic way. The cinnamon stuck around just enough to give it a younger, more modern flair. There is a subtle creaminess that shows itself later down the line that makes it even more agreeable I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least. It would definitely be a bit stifling in hotter weather, and i dont really think a highschooler or younger guy could pull it off. I also dont think it could be anyone&#x27;s signature fragrance due to its heavy, feisty qualities, but for the price theres no reason to not give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;4/5 for the scent&lt;br /&gt;3/5 for the packaging (as it was scuffed and the box was destroyed)</li>
    <li> The product is as expected&lt;br /&gt;This item is OK, I like it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everybody&lt;br /&gt;This product is good quality</li>
    <li> i just got this perfume in other to check it but i dont like the fragrance because is like too old for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews , I must say it last pretty long and smells great and the ladies love</li>
    <li> thanks a lot thanks to them is precisely what they offered me the article is very nice and is what I wanted thanks</li>
    <li> The last time I bought cologne for myself, alone, ended quite poorly. I wound up with some Versace scent that, to me, smelled absolutely great and fresh. To everyone else, it smelled like freshly cut grass. Obviously I found solace in that scent, but others were not quite so enthralled by it. That&#x27;s okay. Still better than the one time my (now ex-)girlfriend bought me something that smelled like dandelions. I don&#x27;t care if she liked it; it gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jump forward to a few weeks ago and I realized that my Diesel Fuel For Life, a scent my best (female) friend helped me select, was about to run out. It was a rather great hit of a cologne: reminding me of those sugary Smarties I used to eat as a kid, and my female company of the dark-but-goofy person that I seem to be so often described as. As much as I like Fuel For Life, I decided I might as well try something new. While I really wanted Vintage by John Varvatos, a nice darker and very unique scent, the price tag threw me off. So when some of the reviews of Diesel Zero Plus seemed to describe it in a similar manner, I took the plunge. Especially since the price was unbelievably good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package from Perfumeland Megastore was as good as could be asked for. A simple 6&amp;#34; cardboard cube, lined with crumpled butcher&#x27;s paper, inside of which the cologne was cocooned. The label on the display case / holder for the actual bottle indicated that it was all made in Germany, which is pretty cool. At any rate, shipping was quick and uneventful and the actual presentation of the bottle itself was quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How&#x27;s the scent? Well, it&#x27;s no Vintage, but it seems far more age appropriate for a mid-twenties male who wants to smell nice but also doesn&#x27;t wish to send weird vibes to his friends. While it has some considerable lingering power, especially initially, the scent eventually subsides after about a half hour / hour. A that point it becomes a more subtle hint, as it should be, opposed to the aura of stink/scent that everyone recognizes as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch&#x27;s Fierce. And when it matters, at the end of a night, and lady company rests her head upon your chest... yes. There&#x27;s enough left for her to pause, sniff, and then hug you even tighter. Need I say any more?</li>
    <li> Bought this strictly for the look of the packaging (it comes in a glass orb that is quite nifty and desginer label (diesel), one of my favorite brands.  Was dissapointed at first smell, since I did not get to test the cologne, this was my own fault.  The smell is very powdery, almost feminine, but I can smell the cinnamon and wood as well that masks some of the powdery smell. Overall it&#x27;s a Good buy for the price but if your like me and like a more masculine smell, I would suggest the Diesel Green for almost the same price.</li>
    <li> I use this cologne, and everyone that has smelled it on me has really liked it.  I get a lot of compliments on how I smell when I wear this.  To me, it has that \\&quot;I gotta get you in bed\\&quot; attraction. Haha. :)</li>
    <li> sobre este articulo no tengo critica alguna estoy totalmente conforme y satisfecho, hasta me gustaria comprar otro, cuando aparesca otra oferta.......</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and the price was great-It smells great and is something I would purchase again.Large bottle and has a clean fresh scent.</li>
    <li> compre 11 perfumes y me llegaron destapados y derramado todo los frasco se le quito la pintura y no tienen olor a nada</li>
    <li> After I bought this for the first time, I received lot of compliments from everyone especially girls. So I decided to buy it again and keep it in stock. The price was real good compared to retailers out there in market. Real Masculine smell and has a little bit of cinnamon flavor.</li>
    <li> Ordered it for my dad as a gift. He likes it but then again he doesn&#x27;t really know the difference between the real thing or the impostor. It looks like an impostor, the smell doesn&#x27;t even last that long, but like I stated he couldn&#x27;t tell so \\&quot;Oh, well\\&quot;</li>
    <li> gross.  i usually like diesel fragrance.  it smells like baby powder and aged cinammon. it smells musty.  wanted to like it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent, the pure spiciness and warmth reminds me of Santa Claus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying some more this Christmas</li>
    <li> The aroma is very nice and good to fall and teens. The presentation is quite original. It&#x27;s a nice gift</li>
    <li> It was fast, good,  everything I needed and expected. Really good job and thanks once again. Great doing business with you.</li>
    <li> Muy buenas cumplen con todo lo ofrecido por el proveedor, manejan buen tiempo de entrega, muy buen servicio y calidad.</li>
    <li> Thanks to your company&lt;br /&gt;By sending the products bought&lt;br /&gt;I received perfectly in my address in Brazil&lt;br /&gt;congratulations to all and much success</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,  VENDIDO TAL COMO DESCRIBE EN LA WEB DE AMAZON , RECOMENDADO ESPECIALMENTE PARA QUIENES DESEEN DARSE UN REGALO Y AHORRAR AL MISMO TIEMPO</li>
    <li> This is a horrible smell and in fact it actually smells cheap. I&#x27;ve bought other Diesel scents in the past and had high hopes for this even with the low price tag.... unfortunately it isn&#x27;t even worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> It smells very nice on the husband, and the price is right...no complaints here!!!&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t too feminine, nor too overpowering. My husband needed something to wear to work, or when he&lt;br /&gt;gets out of the shower, and this works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have never used this item, but my dad loves it, that&#x60;s the only reason I don&#x60;t give it a 4 stars</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for a good many years and I use others too. But I always have a bottle of Diesel on my dresser.</li>
    <li> I love it... It is soft and deep; excellent and Good quality and price, this fragance worth it and much attitude</li>
    <li> This cologne is one of the best smelling colognes out there... Hands Down!!! I have been using it for many years and would recommend it to anyone who wants to smell good.</li>
    <li> Really didnt smell as good as I thought it would but for the price u cant beat it. But wouldnt recommend</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for the past six years and women (of all ages) comment on how pleasant it is!! Personally its aroma is slightly woodsy and after its initial application you do not detect it on yourself, but it does last through the day!</li>
    <li> the aroma is good and the price is convenient, it is an excellent gift. the case is very attractive and elegant</li>
    <li> Pure cinnamon! I can see how some people may like it but definitely not for me!!! For older men I think.</li>
    <li> Great cologne, very warm, powdery, cinnamon heavy, a touch of copper and tin, a bit of vanilla.  Stylish, intimate, but not subtle.  It&#x27;s clean enough that you can get away with wearing it during the day, but it would be too much for the summer sun - stick to wearing at night or during other seasons.    Aside from a lack of subtlety my only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a cap unless you keep it in the ridiculous plastic globe/stand thing it comes in, so the nozzle gets a bit gummy.  Also can&#x27;t be brought with when traveling.</li>

    <li> I got this cologne for my boyfriend. He loves it. Its a heavy winter scent. You only need a little at a tim.</li>
    <li> This scent has captivated me for its packaging, delivery of Amazon was accurate, I&#x27;m really pleased and happy for such an effective logistical. Perfume is the seducer of men who always played with their wonderful machines carts as a child and became strong arms struggle.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto de acuerdo a lo esperado, el envío fue acorde a la fecha señalada, estoy muy satisfecha con el producto, lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> The price it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragance and bottle. I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s without box.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible I will recomend to my friends and paratentals.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected.  I was going to return it but the kids were playing around with a ball in the house and unfortunately broke the bottle before I could send it back.</li>
    <li> Perfume is maluquisimo, thank you, it was perfect, but it smells horrible, thank you very much for sending but not Good Holiday, the smell is unpleasant.</li>
    <li> very original. recommend the product. very good fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne un-sampled because my favorite scent is actually made by Diesel so I figured this could not be that drastic of a difference. I was very wrong. The closest thing I can compare this too is the smell of bug spray. I am not exaggerating on this and still love my other Diesel cologne scents I have smelled. I am going to end up throwing this one away though (unfortunately). Buyer beware if you are a fan of the brand and have never smelled this before. Hopefully this helps someone else who thinks they may be purchasing a different scent. Happy hunting.</li>
    <li> my grandson loves this really nice smell only thing was the package was broke when it arrived but it is a wonderful scent</li>
    <li> So I bought this because I took everyone else&#x27;s advice about how their experience with this product was pleasurable.  Truthfully, I sprayed this on myself and seriously equated it to my grandmother&#x27;s cinnamon perfume.  If you&#x27;re looking for a rugged more masculine scent, then this DEFINATELY is NOT it.  Although, if you&#x27;re into powdery cinnamon then go ahead and purchase.</li>
    <li> This cologne Diesel Zero Plus was a little on the powdery side. This is something that&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
