<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely terrible. I purchased it not having ever heard of &amp;#34;hard wax&amp;#34; versus what my salon uses. Tried legs first and it was messy and difficult to work with...and patchy. My husband decided he would try to help me and we moved to an area on my armpit...worst idea ever. Once again, patchy AND for the areas that did stick, ripped off layers and layers of skin leaving me with what feels like a huge scrape. Now have a bandaid over it because I couldn&#x27;t even put my arm down...attractive for bathing suit season, eh? Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent home product. Plenty of hard wax. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> It took me a while. To get used to this, just because I&#x27;ve never waxed before, but I love it. It works great. It does take a while to warm up, but that&#x27;s to be expected because it is a hard wax. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this more in the future. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have really coarse underarm hair and the roots are so deep and thick that when I shave my skin color there is grey :/  Some advice though if you&#x27;ve never waxed, maybe get it done professionally first until maybe you get a little used to it because OWW! I was regretting it a bit but it was too late to turn back once i started Had to take 2 shots of vodka just to finish the second underarm.. but my armpits have never looked better :)</li>
    <li> Not for beginners. I made a mess and didn&#x27;t have much success even after watching the DVD.</li>
    <li> I use this on my underarms and legs and they are almost painless. I like how this saves me time and saves me from unnecessary pain and cuts caused by razor. A must-have for every woman.</li>
    <li> I definitely love this product. I went to a well known wax place in town. It was my first visit ever and liked the result of my full Brazilian wax. It was painful at first coz its was my very first ever but the tech was good that it was bearable. This second time I wanted to do it by myself to save $50 per session. I decided to buy this kit on &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; but for some reason  the seller changed it to a regular UPS five days delivery. Whatever! I&#x27;m just glad it came and used the product by myself with same results as at the wax place. Saved me hundreds of dollars. I&#x27;m very happy and easy to use.  Please make sure to send my product PRIME when that&#x27;s what I paid for!</li>
    <li> This works great for our purposes, which so far has been facial hair.  It is MUCH better than any wax you buy in the store.  It&#x27;s just like going to a salon, only cheaper.  (Also more risky, as my daughter pulled out too much eyebrow recently.  But I&#x27;ve heard that sometimes happens in salons as well.)</li>
    <li> By far the worst purchase I ever made on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this several months ago - The package was damaged, and the upper lid was in pieces. Amazon promptly agreed to pay the entire price. However, since it was just the lid that was broken, I rejected the full refund, and only asked to be compensated for the lid.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I set out to use it. It took hours and hours to heat, and when I actually started to use it, it stuck to my skin and hardened. I ended up with red spots all over my skin. It did not satisfy its purpose at all. Created mess all over, and wouldn&#x27;t come out from clothes even after soaking them in hot water.</li>
    <li> I wish I could rate more than 5 stars.  This product is everything it says it is.  I have only gotten soft waxed once. This is my first time hard waxing and I must say I had a pleasant experience. I waxed my own bikini line as well as my underarms. the process is so easy and clean. I watched the dvd this came with which was a great help! I also read the instructions. If you do that, you will be just fine. You don&#x27;t have to be an expert to use it. I love this product and will be ordering more hard wax. I am so glad this came with a warmer!!</li>
    <li> I had never used wax products at home before this... so easy for a first timer and hardly any mess to clean up.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I was super nervous about waxing my own bikini line. No one likes ripping out their own hair. But my hair is dark and coarse and even when I go somewhere to have my eyebrows waxed they charge me extra. When I shave, it felt smooth but I still have dark little dots everywhere. So I decided to try hard waxing at home to save money and feel a bit more confident in my bikini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit arrived two days earlier than my delivery date. I set aside a few hours, took like 3 Tylenol and a hot shower and exfoliated. I also made sure to drink a lot of water throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the wax heat up for about 20 minutes on high. Figuring out the right temp to apply and rip is key. I found it only took a few seconds once on the skin. Also, watch some hard waxing videos on YouTube. It helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurt much less than getting my brows waxed. So much less that I gave myself the full &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; the first time out! I kind of used the whole can. But I did my legs, my bikini, my nether regions and even did my boyfriend&#x27;s downstairs. He&#x27;s a trooper. Plus he wanted to see what the fuss was about. I feel so good down there. Like a brand new gal! And three days later, it&#x27;s smooth sailin! I will totally buy another couple of cans</li>
    <li> One word &amp;#34;Amazing&amp;#34;, If you do it right like they explain in the CD you are a hairless queen...I have been epilating for years but with so much pain. The first strip that I pulled I had to assure myself that I didnt have any pain BUT the hair are gone. A must have if you are into waxing.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing! Although when it was shipped, the bottles were opened inside so the post wax cooling gel and the oil was spilled and all over the box.</li>
    <li> it works great, it warms slow but good</li>
    <li> My wife got this and loves it!!! it is simple to use and works great! she had never done waxing before and the video and instructions with this kit explained everything perfectly. and i love it because it saves me a lot of money, she no longer has to get it done professionally!</li>
    <li> I was not informed when I purchased this, but fortunate that it is in keeping with their claims.  Brochure accompanying product (DVD) gives good info/instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a &#x27;hard wax&#x27; which adheres to the hair vs skin.  Works very well even for self-application first attempts.</li>
    <li> A little messy but once you get the hang of it , works like a charm.....can you say OUCH boys and girls? Even the most course hair was no problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting full Brazilians for years - living in SoCal for so long its sort of a requirement. Since this is so common there it is inexpensive to get it done. Boy was I in for a rude awakening when I moved to D.C. The women must just stay hairy here because a Brazilian will set you back upwards of $65 and that&#x27;s without the butt strip! YOUCH! I found very few places that used the hard wax I preferred - the wax with strips leaving me with major ingrown hair. In desperation I turned to amazon to see if there was such a thing as at home waxing. Enter this GiGi kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First - my kit came complete and everything worked. No broken parts, spilled bottles, etc. All good. It was easy to set up - but did take much longer to get the wax hot than it said (took me almost an hour). Once it got hot I put it on Low for 15 minutes and was ready to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second - this stuff is MESSY. Very very messy - at least when doing a Brazilian by yourself. While some areas were very simple others were nearly impossible - and clumps of hair were the most difficult to get effectively - especially as the journey took me further down and under. It took 1/2 the container to do a full Brazilian including the butt strip part (and surrounding area). Unfortunately this wax sticks something terrible. About mid way through I switched from the oil provided to baby powder (which is what my wax lady uses) and that was markedly better. Still the under area was a real bear to do. The heat level of the warmer was just right and I had no issues. No ingrowns that I can see - and very smooth areas after wax. In terms of pain I&#x27;m a masochist so it didn&#x27;t bother me much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third - my lessons learned. Make sure you hold the skin taut - it just doesn&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t. Do put the wax on in the direction of hair but NEVER stop wax in a group of hair...you will be sorry. Try talcum or baby power instead of the oil if that doesn&#x27;t work as well as you want. Put a big towel outyou don&#x27;t care about as it&#x27;s gonna get wrecked. WEAR GLOVES - you will thank me later. Use smaller sticks in areas you cannot see - better to do smaller bits at a time than big globs that get stuck. Don&#x27;t wait too long to pull it off or it glops up and you cannot get it off. Use the cooling gel after - It really did help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck! Overall I am VERY happy with this kit. I am saving about $65-100 a visit using this even with the warmer cost. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have finally found a wax that actually pulls all the hair out. All the waxes I&#x27;ve tried have never been able to actually pull out all the hair. I was only able to do half today and I plan on finishing tomorrow. Yes it obviously hurts because you&#x27;re waxing but this product is extremely easy to use and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. It will also get easier with time since less hair grows in over time :) for $30 it really is worth the shot if you&#x27;ve been searching for a good wax.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of the wax that is included. It makes a huge mess, is hard to get it thick enough, and the line between to hard/brittle and to gooey is wayyyy to fine. I love the warmer. It keeps the wax at a great temperature. I just start hearing it in the morning on the day I want to wax to give it plenty of time to warm. The oil that is included it great. I love the cooling gel and experienced no burning even on irritated parts of my skin, would recommend. I will just be buying a different wax next time</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m a guy and I am hairy. There. I said it. Unfortunately for my kids, so is my wife (they&#x27;re doomed). We&#x27;d often find ourselves spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on salon visits and other creams for razor bumps and those sorts of things. I found myself searching for a cheaper solution and stumbled across this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it as a gift for my wife and she went to work with it right away. She has become a master and was using the kit immediately after watching the instruction DVD. The wax hardens after you apply it to the area and only waxes the hair off of your skin, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all if you&#x27;re used it waxing. I wax my eyebrows often and we&#x27;re still on our first tin of wax after a few months. For anyone that waxes often, you are spending too much money! Get this kit and do it yourself, you will NOT regret this purchase. It&#x27;s so easy!</li>
    <li> I had this unit before which I gave to one of my friend&#x27;s daughter since I am going laser. It is very slow to heat up the wax. You should plug it in 2-3 hrs ahead of time so you have the right consistency to get the job done. Once it gets upto the desired heat, it keep it warm and you can get through the job quickly.</li>
    <li> After I watched the video and read the reviews I knew what to do and it works great. I love it. Way better than strip wax. I&#x27;m using my husbands account- I didn&#x27;t know how to change it.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect purchase for me!! So simple to use and not too messy if I&#x27;m careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moved to a very expensive area so waxing a salon just was not an option anymore. After purchasing this kit, I had everything I needed. No more salon visits unless I get lazy or visit back home...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it hurts. It&#x27;s wax ripping out your hair. Yes, it can be messy. Just be careful. Yes, it&#x27;s hot. It&#x27;s wax. No, it is not fast and easy! It takes me about three hours to complete brazilian, full legs, and full arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re messy, have a low tolerance for pain, and don&#x27;t know the basics of self waxing, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit does come with a How-To dvd. But it didn&#x27;t help much and it had graphics that I could&#x27;ve gone my entire life without seeing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this kit... and so is my husband!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, watch the video before you start. Doing this randomly might hurt more than needed!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, so easy to use and so effective!  I tried the traditional wax (by the same company) first and was SOOOOO disappointed.  This, however, is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I ever paid for an expensive salon visit.  This is easy to use yourself and one can will probably last 4-5 times.</li>
    <li> this is a great home kit but waxing at home is messy. It takes about 45 min to warm and while waxing you have to keep it at lowest temp. I used in the past all purpose wax but with that you will have to use celulose strips. I prefer much better Brazilian wax that you just pull with your fingers. I am a mess so I have to buy a new warmer every year or so, but still cheaper than beauty salon. I have been using gigi for over 5 yrs but now I am considering laser.</li>
    <li> Makes waxing at home a breeze. I recommend getting the no bump roll on from gigi to prevent in-growns. :)</li>
    <li> This wax kit might be amazing....it just ran to hot for me. The lowest setting was to hot for my skin. So I am back at my professional waxer paying 850.00 a year (not including tips) and that only includes my under arms and bikini area, NOT my legs. Anyways, it took forever for it to melt the wax, then I put the heat to low for many hours in hopes that it would cool down. After hours on low it was still to hot to use. I tried it again later and it was still too hot for me. It really seems like an awesome kit, and it really might be. I was just to much of a wimp to take the heat of the wax, the wax melter needs more than just two settings.</li>
    <li> This kit will pay for itself in one use.  I found I could only bear to use the hard wax on my face because any other place had me close to crying!  so I ordered 14oz crème wax (also had to buy cloth strips) which also fits in the warmer and works so much better and is less painful on everything than the hard wax.  I would still recommend this kit over any other waxing system.  Just youtube videos on this to learn how to keep the mess to a minimum.</li>
    <li> love love love love love.....i have tried them all and this is by far the easiest, less messy (they alllllllllllll have some mess), less irritation, came with everything i needed...will repurchase over and over the rest of my life.....yes it takes longer for it to heat up (about 1/2 an hour) but it is a bigger tub of wax....i honestly will never try anything else again....video was very helpful and simple.</li>
    <li> Perfect for when you&#x27;re starting out.</li>
    <li> This wax works well most of the time. I would prefer this kit includes the wax remover as sometimes the wax will not come off the skin in strips and just sticks to me.  However, for the price it works to be swimsuit ready this summer.</li>
    <li> I loved this little wax kit! I was looking for a hard wax heater because it&#x27;s always a fuss to heat wax in the Stove or microwave,and I found it to be practical,easy to use,it does the job perfectly.It came perfectly packaged and with the DVD. I strongly recommend to watch the ****explicit**** DVD because it contains all the info you need to do your waxing at home safely.I also bought the clean collars (get them so your heater doesn&#x27;t get dirty with sticky wax all over it) and another can of wax separately.&lt;br /&gt;I love this kit and use it a lot!</li>
    <li> Everything in this kit is outstanding and the wax lasts longer then I was expecting which is nice. Nothing was cracked or leaking when my kit arrived either.</li>
    <li> This is the best at home waxing experience I have had. The warmer kept the wax at the perfect temperature and it was easy to use. I have no complaints and think it is a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> This kit is awesome! I have had many professional Brazilian waxes done in the past, and I always knew I could do a better job...with out feeling exposed to a stranger. This warmer kit has EVERYTHING you&#x27;ll need. The warmer itself works wonderful! I turn mine on HIGH for about 15mins. When the sides are melted I turn it to med/low and push the hard wax down into the melted wax. Make sure your wax is the consistency of honey...too thin and it won&#x27;t work and you&#x27;ll have a burned coochie.  For beginners, I would highly recommend dishing out the dough and getting a professional wax done first, this type of waxing is not for sissys. And there are a few tips to be cautious of, like holding the skin taught before pulling. WATCH the instruction video before you wax, even if you consider yourself a pro. Beware... the video is not shy. There are full-on lady parts in it. Oh and the wax lasts a pretty long time as well, my kit has already paid for itself three times over. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> My only complain is that my machine takes a while to heat up, but other than that, it&#x27;s great.  I like being able to do my waxing in private.  Especially because my hair grows back fairly quickly...I bought this product months ago &amp; I&#x27;m still on my first can of wax.  I didn&#x27;t watch the video, but I have used everything else on the kit....the one thing that will make this perfect, is if it came in a carrying case.</li>
    <li> The heater itself is good but the wax is not.  It heats and goes on okay but doesn&#x27;t come off properly. I have worked in a waxing salon so I know how to wax but this just didn&#x27;t work right.  I&#x27;m going to buy some really good wax and try the heater again.</li>
    <li> I got this machine and wax so I can start waxing my legs and down there. It takes time to learn how to do it, but once you master it, its good. And the bonus not spending 45+ dollars at a spa.</li>
    <li> The kit comes with everything that says it has. The video with it was very helpful on how to wax. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Definitely better than going to the wax parlor!&lt;br /&gt;Only waxed my legs and armpits so far...&lt;br /&gt;I had to have someone help me do my pits.&lt;br /&gt;LOL</li>
    <li> Normally I get waxed at European wax center and it&#x27;s very costly, I thought it would be cheaper to buy my own kit. I had bought the kit along w the muslin roll. I first tried to wax my legs and with the paper ontop of the wax it did not work. I was just pulling off the paper and not the wax, so I just started to peel off the wax by itself. It hurt like hell as it always does. But I learned that if you pull the wax strip off fast, the wax breaks off, it only works for me if you pull the wax strip very slowly but yes it hurts because you feel every hair being pulled. Make sure you buy wax remover or else u will have wax residue that you cannot rub off yourself. I give it 4 stars bc I&#x27;m mad u can&#x27;t pull the strip off quickly or with the paper strip.</li>
    <li> I purchased the waxing kit for my eyebrows and it works great!!! I will probably try other areas in the future.</li>
    <li> Loved the kit, but had to get a different type of wax--</li>
    <li> Best easy product! Must say I will probably never go to a salon to wax again!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had some BAD experiences with all different kinds of wax. This is finally something I will never switch from. Professional quality. Big pot, which is nice compared to some other pots that are horribly small. Easy clean up with the paper liner. It heats up quick and holds just the right temperature. I have pretty sensitive skin also and as long as I use the before and after stuff provided I have no problems, some ingrown hairs but that&#x27;s inevitable for me. I still must consume half a bottle of vodka and it still hurts like a mother but what do you expect with ripping your hairs out?! I have yet to wax my eye brows, but I use it regularly on my hoo-ha and my armpits. As long as you have the basic knowledge on how to wax yourself you will have no problems at all. (apply with the grain and rip off against the grain, hold the skin TIGHT and it will come off easy, and to lessen the afterpain touch it with your hand immediately, something about the skin to skin contact helps) I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> Great for thinner and longer hairs but not as good for short eyebrow hairs. But great on arms and legs!</li>
    <li> Made a HUGH mess.....had dried, sticky wax left on my legs for a week! Will never use again!</li>
    <li> Ahh, where to begin...&lt;br /&gt;Well, being a Latina (I&#x27;m Puerto Rican) and my genetics, I am just naturally hairy, which is a major pain in my ass. :( I&#x27;ve been shaving and waxing since I was 11 years old...I&#x27;m 20 now. Over the years I&#x27;ve spent SO much money waxing both in salons and at home with those pre-cut/pre-waxed Sally Hansen strips. Fortunately for me, I found this kit. IT IS AMAZING!!! The warmer itself is pretty good, I leave it for maybe 40 minutes on High to Medium heat to completely melt the wax. It also comes with some handy sticks, varying in different sizes to spread the wax, pre-waxing oil and cooling gel (for after) and a CD. I feel like the oil is pretty useless, though. Just make sure the area is clean, put on some baby powder and get to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax doesn&#x27;t require the muslin strips. Apply it, it hardens and then you pull it off. Make sure you apply this wax on kind of thick. Or else it will be hard to lift the corner to pull. The first time, I pinched my skin on accident a lot and ended up with like a billion bruises :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Wax in general can be pretty messy. If this is your first time or you&#x27;re inexperienced, I recommend doing this on a non-carpeted floor, like  bathroom and lay down an old towel/paper underneath you. And have baby oil ready for clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall thoughts, this kit has been the best investment I&#x27;ve ever made. Your legs, underarms, face and bikini area will be smooth and thankful (: I love my gigi wax warmer👍💕</li>
    <li> I used it one time, and while it did take a while to heat up (almost 2 hrs for me) I was happy with my purchase, and it did everything I expected it to do. The applicator sticks were a nice bonus, and the everything else in that kit worked well. Fast forward about 6 weeks, I plug it in and turn it on only to realize that the light wouldn&#x27;t come on. I checked the plug, and even tried a different outlet, but nothing worked. It will not come on at all, or produce heat of any kind. Total waste of money, and it&#x27;s a shame because it seemed like it could be a very good product. Maybe I just got a defected one; I&#x27;m not sure, but I would beware of buying it because of this annoying flaw.</li>
    <li> Really nice waxing kit ! you should get one . First time i try kinda hurt but after that it all okay</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit! I have saved so much money by waxing myself. The wax is good quality and I like the pre-wax oil that helps with the wax only adhering to the hair and not the skin. The post wax cooling gel is good as well. I only wish there were more applicators that came with the kit, but otherwise I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Closest to salon care I believe.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!  Face it ladies. As we get older and the hormones start bouncing around, hair starts growing where it isn&#x27;t supposed to!  Up to now I have been tweezing my lip and chin but it has reached the stage where tweezing couldn&#x27;t keep up.  Plus no matter how hard you try, there are those spots you just can&#x27;t see!  So I thought what the heck!  I  did my lip and chin area this time. I will be doing under arms next.  I didn&#x27;t let the wax completely melt in the heater and it worked fine.  I suggest playing with some on your forefinger tip and thumb.  You can feel when it starts to get sticky and get an idea of the proper consistency and thickness.  Spread on kind of thick and pull the applicator away from your skin at the end so it leaves an edge to grab on to. Start small till you get the hang of it. Just so you know,  I have very sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all, just a little redness...I think bandaids hurt more!  I took my time and twirled the applicator with wax on it like a cotton candy and made no mess at all.  I did put down an old towel just in case, cause accidents happen. The oil helps too but I don&#x27;t plan on buying more when it is gone.  I will use coconut oil. The gel seems to have some lidocaine or something in it that sort oil numbs the area a little. But like I said, it didn&#x27;t really hurt at all.  Just don&#x27;t psych yourself out!  I am very happy and satisfied with this product. I have a very bad back and it is hard to bend over to shave my legs. ...was even thinking about getting a shower chair! But I am not that old!!! Now I can sit in a chair and wax away!</li>
    <li> I use it for underarm and it is the best thing I have ever used for that area. The skin is hairless for quite some time, and leaves the skin very soft</li>
    <li> After years of paying an esthetician for Brazilian waxes, I finally decided I&#x27;d spent enough to cover my own kit ten times over! I did thorough research and the reviews on the GiGi Brazilian waxing kit were so helpful and accurate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before getting into my review, I will start by saying this process actually hurt LESS than when a professional did mine. Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m controlling the motion and speed but I handled it a LOT better. Watch the DVD for great tips! Also, drink plenty of water that day - it makes hair removal so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warmer worked perfectly. I actually forgot I turned it on so I had to wait a little longer for it to cool down on the low setting. The kit came with all the essentials. I used the pre-epi oil...not sure if it helped but my skin didn&#x27;t react so I&#x27;ll continue to use it. The post-wax lotion stung a little (as most cooling gels have that same effect) but ultimately, it did its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a full Brazilian, I barely needed any wax. The dvd explains that you need to use a thicker layer of wax than the wax used with strips (which I continually forgot but eventually got the hang of measuring the correct amount to apply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collar will probably last 2-3 uses but I echo the earlier reviews about buying a refill pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only word of caution I have would be that you should use only if you&#x27;ve been professionally waxed before. I took a lot of past experiences to help my technique. I can&#x27;t imagine doing this with no prior experience (ouch!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with my purchase. It&#x27;s definitely worth more than its priced at!</li>
    <li> It is amazing works well. It was in good condition when I received it. would suggest using paper strips with the wax because at times it remains too tacky to get off on its own and when using a strip of paper you feel not a bit of pain. Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and is very simple to use even if like me you have no experience with self-waxing.</li>
    <li> Step one when using this product- read directions and follow them exactly. Great product for hair removal. Oils don&#x27;t make me break out but all skin types are different.</li>
    <li> Like this very much  saves lots of money</li>
    <li> pretty good value for price.  if you&#x27;re good at self-waxing, this is a good product.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of it, its so easy and quick to use. I love the fact I am saving money by not having to pay to have waxing done. And saves so much time and money in the long run for me. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic waxing kit. However, no matter what you do, at home waxing is not for the faint at heart. Do see a professional, at least once before you attempt this to get an idea of how they apply/remove the wax. And be prepared to spend some time at this if its your first rodeo! My first attempt alone took me 3 whole hours. THREE HOURS. And eventually I wussed out and now I&#x27;m left with a random patch up top that looks silly. BUT seriously, three whole hours of ripping hardened wax and hair off your lady bits will come to that at times. Take some OTC pain medication about 45-30 mins before you start the process. DO use the oil, and if you have baby powder (or corn starch in a pinch) lightly dust that on as well. It helps so the wax only sticks to the hair and not your skin, also helps to remove and moisture. DO wax in the direction of the hair growth, always pull wax off in the opposite direction of the hair growth or you&#x27;re just going to end up ripping hair and not ripping it out. Not a pleasant experience. All in all, it does what you need it to do. Just be prepared, waxing hurts, no matter what you do.</li>
    <li> They serve its purpose for tge area I need waxubg.</li>
    <li> Saves me so much money going to the wax center. I now wax my sisters lip and eyebrows as well!</li>
    <li> Great my a beginner like myself.</li>
    <li> Waxing hurts. This kit DID contain everything necessary to perform a Brazilian wax, however I think I&#x27;m going to stick to shaving. :P</li>
    <li> Exactly what i paid for! very easy to use !!</li>
    <li> Love it! Packaged well  and comes with everything you could need. This is the first time doing an at home wax and I was a little nervous but didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected. Tips: Use in small/thick sections about an inch or 2 in length and rip off while breathing out.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> good enough and works well also</li>
    <li> While i do not use as a bikini wax, i do use on other parts of my body.  This is great and has lasted a very long time.  Does not take long to heat up or cool down.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I had used the Brazilian Wax and I love it. It was easy and the instructions were simple to follow.  It was also shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Pros and cons on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: wax was pretty easy to use, once I got the technique down. It worked well, and was forgiving on legs. I will keep practicing on legs before I try bikini.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the box was missing applicators. I did go out and purchase Gigi applicators at a local store, but I won&#x27;t buy them again. They were expensive, and broke!</li>
    <li> it hurt. i am a broken man.</li>
    <li> I was super excited about this product but it has been 1 and 30 min on high heat and the wax is only half melted. very dissapointed</li>
    <li> This kit was delivered in good timing and excellent condition.&lt;br /&gt;The product is great quality and I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Note: Wax is something you have to manage with gentleness and care.  Beware of the temperature.</li>
    <li> Great product , easy to use , the wax is very good on my skin and very comfertable to use.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY IT! Horrible packaging... My kit came with a broken lid and they won&#x27;t replace it. Products look used and old. Do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Takes a little long to heat up the wax, but I&#x27;d rather have that then scalding hot wax boiling over. The low feature worked well too. I have soft wax (14 oz) that I bought and I can use that in the same heater. I like that they included the oil (although you can use baby or olive oil when you run out) and the cooling gel (Haven&#x27;t found a cheaper alternative). I also like the assortment of sticks they give you. Only bad thing is it only comes with one collar so if you&#x27;re like me and you bought another type of wax you do need to get a pack of collars because it does get quite waxy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple months now. It works so well. I am never shaving again thanks to this product. Consider these items:&lt;br /&gt;1) You don&#x27;t need waxing strips. I was confused as to why I didn&#x27;t receive this in the box, but if you watch the tutorial that is provided- you just let the wax harden and pull the wax off your skin! It&#x27;s so impressive because it doesnt pull your skin off.&lt;br /&gt;2)I don&#x27;t use the little trial-sized containers that are provided. I use coconut oil at the end to take the wax off. It works fairly well for me.&lt;br /&gt;3)Always put down a throw-away towel wherever you&#x27;re waxing. I dripped some on my carpet and it&#x27;s really stubborn. I&#x27;m not sure how to get it out of my carpet without cutting it out.&lt;br /&gt;4)Yes, the first and second time suck. ESPECIALLY the first time. Damn! ~haha. But it got better and it&#x27;s really not that bad afterwards. Look up some YouTube videos if you don&#x27;t really know how to do it. The video they provide you, however, is really beneficial. Watch it! It&#x27;s only about less than 10 minutes long..&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m probably a client for life. Forget shaving!</li>
    <li> love this but pot gets messy</li>
    <li> I was expecting much more pain but I lovr . Really a big fan of it . It arrived in its time and they checked with me if everything is alright . They deserve the 5 stars</li>
    <li> Amazing! I have been waxing at a salon for about five years..After moving to a new city I was reluctant to trust a new salon. This kit gave me a cheaper, more pain free, and less Breakout excuse to not have to find a new place to be waxed. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t personally care for the gel. oil is good. dvd is very very basic. wax turns out to be about half the price of sally brand I was getting from cvs in the lil blue jar. also stripless. Honestly I like the sally brand better and have used all sorts over the yrs but for the price of this gigi stripless brazillian wax you cant beat it! And the warmer is an amazing convenience to keep you from running back to the microwave all the time when you&#x27;re in your own home. I am happy w it overall and will be ordering again...someday...when this big 14oz jar runs out.</li>
    <li> Great kit to have at home. It&#x27;s very easy to use and comes with everything you need. The wax is good quality and sets pretty quick. The warmer also works great and heats up the wax within 30 minutes on high.</li>
    <li> Great for nose hair:)</li>
    <li> One of my mostly used products! love it! super easy to use and easy clean up!</li>
    <li> Okey, the package came in perfect conditions. But once I start putting the wax with one of the stick it didn&#x27;t sick well and I made a mess cause latter the were sticky tings all over my body and floor. And once you try to take off the wax is too painful. Iwill never buy it again. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot. It is a good price for the package it comes with. I would recommend this basic waxing kit.</li>
    <li> The biggest problem with this wax is that it has to be JUST THE RIGHT temperature at any given time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s too hot when you apply it, it burns.&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s too cool when you apply it, it doesn&#x27;t spread well/evenly, and doesn&#x27;t adhere to anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s too hot when you try and pull it off, it just stretches and pulls painfully&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s too cool when you try and pull it off, it just breaks instead of pulling off in one strip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for professionals I&#x27;m sure, but I much prefer to just use the premade waxing strips you can buy. Plus with those, you can rub ice cubes over the area right before you pull it off to numb the pain. Faster, less messy, and less painful. Not to mention less chance of burning yourself or getting wax everywhere.</li>
    <li> Freaking painful and doesn&#x27;t freaking work! Totally bummed I made more of a freaking mess than I did pull out hairs.</li>
    <li> Bought it to use for my eyebrows and it&#x27;s working perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> Great product that makes at -home waxing as easy as it can be. This wax is the best for bikini waxing that I have found. The whole kit is a great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The kit is beautifully packaged, arrived within only three days. I had watched several youtube videos on waxing prior to receiving package. It comes with a DVD, but my player wasn&#x27;t working at the moment. So, after viewing those, I felt like an expert. Didn&#x27;t order all the special stuff to go with it - you simply don&#x27;t need it. Baby oil your face, blot dry. Lightly dust face with baby powder, and you&#x27;re ready to wax. Put wax on IN DIRECTION of hair growth (get a little magnifying mirror to put on regular mirror). Wax only needs to stay on slightly over 60 seconds. You want it somewhat soft and pliable. Keeping wax strip close to face, quickly remove it in opposite direction (against hair growth direction). There was absolutely no pain, except a bit of discomfort right under my nose. It worked like a dream. Only thing was I had a rash next day. Used once again, and one application of walmart brand hydrocortisone ointment right afterward stopped rash cold. Excellent results. Only sorry I wasn&#x27;t doing this the last 30 years. It&#x27;s easy and NOT messy at all. Just like frosting a cake.</li>
    <li> I like this hard wax. I am an amateur, and only wax myself, but this wax worked well on areas with course hair. I liked that it didn&#x27;t require strips, as I felt like this was less waste. I felt like it did take a while to get the full pot of wax warm enough for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still buy this if I hadn&#x27;t started making my own sugar based hair removal product now.</li>
    <li> The whole product is very nice and useful, I just wasn&#x27;t thrilled that when I got my package the Pre-Epilation Oil was partially opened and spilled all over the box. Smeared the writing completely off the warmer. Still worked great, but lets keep the stuff we pay for in the container because the returns can sure be a hassle.</li>
    <li> Good kit over all.  All components are of good quality and the instructional DVD was very helpful and educational.  We had good success with this product from the very first use. The 14oz wax is ample for numerous treatments.</li>
    <li> I love this product !!!</li>
    <li> More like 3.5 stars. It definitely gets the hair off better than sugar wax, but it&#x27;s very time consuming and there&#x27;s a big learning curve I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m up to mastering (and I&#x27;m only just doing my legs, not my other bits!). It works, you just have to be patient and mess around with it. And I mean MESS. But it works.  And one other thing: the product came with a bottle of oil that exploded during shipping, making everything a greasy mess before I even opened the box. I thought about returning it, but I cleaned it up and it was okay.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Works as it should and keeps the wax temp where it needs to be. Will say it takes a while to melt the wax in colder rooms / temps, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Love Gigi wax too, smells great and applies evenly.</li>
    <li> Great product I did not expect the quality I got</li>
    <li> Easy to use for bikini, face, and underarms. I found it pretty painless. Less irritation on my face than pre-waxed strips.  Happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> She says it works, it hurts less than any method she tried and she already did about 4 complete body cycles and still has some material to use..so probably a good value for you money too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this item to ANYONE! I&#x27;ve been trying to find a wax product that is right for me and I finally have. Minimal pain and irritation and my skin feels AMAZING for at least 3 weeks after, sometimes longer. I&#x27;ve noticed the more I use, the less time I have to go between waxes. I&#x27;ve noticed on my legs, after only having used it 5 times to wax my legs, there are quite a few areas that are actually not growing back at all. For me, the legs and armpits hurt the worst but everything else is a breeze. I don&#x27;t have a need to use it on my face so I can&#x27;t say if that is painful or if irritation occurs. Will not use any other products to wax now!!!</li>
    <li> The heating console works fine, but it does take at least another to fully warm up. I recommend letting the wax cool back down so that the wax consistency is thick and not so runny after being heated on high for an hour. This way it will make for a better waxing experience. I waxed my legs with this. The first time it was a hot mess, literally. The second time it was much better, the wax was easy to remove and took off all the hair. It took me a while but practice makes perfect!</li>
    <li> Great product for waxing.  Does the job very well!</li>
    <li> Dude, this is the best starter kit! The instruction video was a bit dated. Overall, the kit did what it should, how it should..in the right professional hands, of course.</li>
    <li> Wow. Fell in love with this!&lt;br /&gt;I used to go to salon for Brazilian waxing, and was planning to make an appointment again. Then my friend recommended this product (actually she bought a microwave one), so with a little suspicion, I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;It took 3~4days to arrive, and it was today.&lt;br /&gt;I read through the instruction, watched video (also youtube ones), tried it on my armpit first, and it worked wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;It was so much easier and cleaner than shaving or whatever. With armpit, it wasn&#x27;t painful at all, but the bikini area was quite a pain.&lt;br /&gt;I think it was partly because of my clumsiness.. so I don&#x27;t want to blame the product and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend this to my other friends too!</li>
    <li> I have wax my entire life and unfortunately I have to say that I had many problems with this wax. It is very sticky and it does not dry in 30 seconds as it says in the manual. I applied the wax on my leg and I was not able to remove it because it was not dry enough, I waited a couple of seconds more and it was too dry that it broke it peaces when I tried to remove it. I could not keep using it until the end. To end even worst, this was gave me bad allergies on my skin. I tried to return it but this product is not returnable, so I called Amazon and they were able to help me.</li>
    <li> Yay! great wax kit, Buy this!!! &amp;#60;3 You will love it, it&#x27;s easy to use and It warm up really very fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I got this for my pits, not for my &amp;#34;bikini area&amp;#34;.  This product comes with everything you need.  It took a lot longer than it claimed to melt the wax, which was my only real complaint.  Waxing is always painful and can be very messy, so I was expecting that.  To get the excess wax off just use crisco.</li>
    <li> Excellent waxing kit, much better than the tuna fish can in a pot of water on the stove that I used to use to melt the wax!  I use the wax on my upper lip and chin area and it works perfectly.  I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this waxing kit.</li>
    <li> I love the hard wax it is so easy to use and it comes with the pre and post creams so you have everything you need!&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it shipped so fast!&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this to anyone who needs a simple but effective wax kit</li>
    <li> I wax my whole face at least once a week due to this amazing kit! It just gets everything and I have extremely thick and dark hair! My legs alone always grow back an hour after I shave and step outta the shower...so embarrassing. My best friend is a beauty school student and is required to have this exact kit and she bought hers (same exact kit) for$136 through her school!!!! Can&#x27;t believe this kit is so cheap! I will never ever buy anything else! Comes with the oils the warming unit the wax and some wooden application socks in various sizes :) oh and comes with a DVD to show you exactly how to wax with different techniques and tips on how to make waxing less painful! By the way, hard wax is way less painful than soft! I already need to buy another batch of hard wax :)</li>
    <li> Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered mine on the 9th late at night, received the 12th, i was shocked it got here so fast!&lt;br /&gt;I used it right away, this was my first time waxing anything other than my eyebrows. it was easy to use and worked perfect for me even though i had no experience using something like this before. the wax works awesome!! Im so happy i got it. I think some of the other reviews are from people who were not using it on the right temperature because mine worked great.</li>
    <li> Works way better than the microwave kit. A must have for at home waxers!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and was pretty skeptical. I will say this- this first time did not go very well; however since then I have learned a few tricks and things are going well. Follow the instructions and I think it will go easier. You also must be sure to turn it to the lowest setting possible once the wax is melted- I have found for me, once it is melted I actually turn it off and as it cools it works great. I don&#x27;t care for the angled sticks, I bought regular popsicle like sticks and I feel they work much better.</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping for... Maybe even better!  Definitely like the hard wax better than soft wax, far less painful as it doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin, just the hair...</li>
    <li> The different size sticks means you can wax anything, anywhere. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend waxing down there by yourself though. Too painful, too messy.</li>
    <li> For less than the cost of one salon wax, this kit includes everything you need, and lasts a long time. The pre-epilation oil is fantastic and makes the waxing almost painless. I find that leaving the warmer set to &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; is the best for congealing quickly on skin, to prevent a mess. I will continue to buy this brand&#x27;s replacement wax tubs, and I also use regular craft sticks, although the small pointed-tip sticks work great for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Great product even for first time waxers. Product exactly as explained, no issues. Would recommended buying baby powder and additional sticks but not necessary. Takes a while but worth the results</li>
    <li> I thought I was orderng wax for the face not realizing that it was Brazilian wax. I wanted to send it back but it doesn&#x27;t qualify for a refund. It doesn&#x27;t come with the strip cloth that I&#x27;m use to for removing the wax. So I decided I better watch the the DVD that comes with it. I found out that the wax is the strips. Just apply and wait a few seconds until it sets then remove the opposite direction that you applied. It&#x27;s so easy. I only used it on my face and I love it. Make sure you watch the video</li>
    <li> This is a great kit, everything you need included and it will last a while.  Pretty much anybody can use it, from brows to bikini.  Just don&#x27;t forget to use the pre-oil prior to use!</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for about 20 years and have never used a hard wax and BOY oh BOY what have I been missing!  Just used this on my eyebrows (between the brows - I will still get my brows shaped by a pro), upper lip and chin and the hair came off with so little pain I was wondering if anything happened.  But my skin is soft and hair free.  The wax does take a very long time to heat up so if you need to do a quick waxing before a date you may be in trouble.  The whole tub, when new, took about 45-50 minutes.  And as many suggested, do use the guard, it does help keep the wax from clogging up the container and keeping the warmer clean.</li>
    <li> It takes a couple times to figure out how to get the application just right but once you do this set is great. I&#x27;ve saved countless $$ on bikini and leg waxes using this set.</li>
    <li> I had the worst experience with this product. The bottle of Pre Epilation oil was opened, dirty, and only had half of the bottle. The rest was ok</li>
    <li> Easy to use (as far as DIY Brazilians go...). Great kit that includes all you need, and for an unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to save money on waxing my eye brows and upper lip instead of going to the nail salon to have it done. I have zero experience in waxing and didn&#x27;t even bother to watch the instructional video (who has time for that) but guessed from all the years I&#x27;ve gone and haven&#x27;t had any issues. I recommend this product if you&#x27;re a regular person looking to save some money but still look fabulous!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times to heat both sugar wax and salon wax.  I&#x27;m getting better at it but I have had a few challenges.  The salon wax included in here doesn&#x27;t go on as thick as what I am used to (Sally Hanson).  It seems to cool very quickly, which can make it brittle and hard to remove.  I like the warmer but I think I will experiment with different brands of wax until I find something that&#x27;s a little more pliable as it cools.  I did also use this warmer on a lower setting to heat my sugar wax, and that worked perfectly.  The sugar wax is nice because it comes out of clothes and you can wash it off your body if you need to do so for any reason, but it&#x27;s not strong enough to remove bikini hair for me.</li>
    <li> Let me just tell you about my experience and I&#x27;ll let you decide whether or not this is worth your money. It was messy at the beginning, but that was because I don&#x27;t have experience nor practice with waxing. I&#x27;d suggest using an old towel underneath to catch any dripping wax. I&#x27;ve always had someone do it for me, so I expected to struggle and feel slightly foolish. The kit does come with everything that it claims to have, which I was extremely happy with. As noted by others, it does take longer than 30 minutes for the wax to melt. It took about an hour for me, but I usually go off and do something else as I wait for it to heat up. The wax can get extremely hot, so I would advise you to slightly rotate your wax on the waxing stick or blow on it to cool it off before applying. Using the pre-epilator cream helped a lot in regards to making sure the wax didn&#x27;t stick to my skin. I was also pleased to see that the wax grabbed onto some hairs I couldn&#x27;t pull out with my tweezers. Considering we are all different, I can&#x27;t guarantee this will work for you, but I plan on keeping my kit. :)</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s not exactly the &amp;#34;compete&amp;#34; kit it claims to be (the instructions call for things the kit doesn&#x27;t have, like powder), it is a great buy! The wax is perfect, the heater works great, and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Expectations were met</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best at-home waxing kits available on the market. The included DVD is helpful and the wooded sticks come in multiple sizes. Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was my first at home waxing experience. It went fairly well. Make sure the wax isn&#x27;t too hot. You want it to be somewhat thick. Otherwise it will be brittle and break off into little pieces rather than a strip. Using the oil first really helps as well although I will try powder next time. Overall, good product. I am ordering more.</li>
    <li> The wax ddin&#x27;t really work for me. It was hard to put on and peal off.</li>
    <li> But, it was easy and worked great.  The wax really does only stick to the hair (not skin).  Only a couple parts were painful, but I got through it.  The bf thought I went to the salon, I didn&#x27;t tell him it was a DIY.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily paid for itself with the one wax.  I got crazy and did my brows too.  It looks like I could probably get 3-5 uses per tin, especially once I perfect my technique.</li>
    <li> love it, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do!!</li>
    <li> Second Updated Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself is very good! It pulls almost every single hair on the first application. It typically takes a second application to completely remove every bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first pull/tug was the hardest. My...it was painful, despite the oil and pulling the skin tightly. Even after bathing with warm water to open up the pores a little. I&#x27;ve noticed that the pain tolerance may have gone up some toward the end. Keep at it ladies. It does get easier. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prep your area by trimming down to about 1/4 - 1/2 inch. Any longer and it may be even more painful. And the worst thing is that the wax may not stick properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely wear gloves. I had tile floors in the bathroom so it was a breeze to clean up. If you have carpet, use newspaper or a towel to cover the floor. It will get messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warmer does take time to melt the wax. Give about 15 mins on high then lower to medium for about 5 mins then lower it to the lowest setting for 10 minutes before applying the wax on your skin. Test it first on the back of your hand. Apply again direction of hair growth. The wax should not be too runny and start to dry almost immediately on your skin. Don&#x27;t let it harden. It should be soft to the touch but not sticky. Tug on the edge with the stick then pull the strip the opposite direction of the hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to request a replacement. The oil seeped through and ruined everything in the box. The warmer did not light up when plugged in. I waited for the light to turn on, thinking it may take a few minutes, but the red nor the green turned on after 15 minutes. I thought it may be my outlet so I tried two more outlets with the same result. Frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement is expected to arrive Thursday, August 1st. I&#x27;m hoping against hope that I will be getting a clean box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very upset! Just like some reviewers, I received an empty bottle of the Pre-Epilating Oil because the cap was not screwed tightly and it was not even pressed down. The oil leaked through the GIGI production box. It also leaked through the Amazon box. Why was it not wrapped or sealed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the product yet and will not use it until I get a complimentary bottle of the Pre-Epilating Oil. I&#x27;ve sent a message to Amazon regarding the packaging so hopefully they will respond shortly. The rating may change to a max of FOUR Stars should the wax exceeds my expectation. The spillage has deducted a star from the overall rating.ty bottle of the Pre-Epilating Oil because the cap was not screwed tightly and it was not even pressed down.

    <li> Watch the Gigi waxing video and follow the instructions step by step using the cloth strips. The first time I used the wax I did not use the cloth strips and it was the worst pain of my life!!  I brought the strips and now wax like a pro with minimal discomfort and no pain! I also purchased the clean + easy wax remover!  I recommend the Sally Hansen Zero Bumps spray for after waxing! The wax lasts forever.  I have used it four times and it is still full. I am on a mission, and saving money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00198XSG0 Fantasea Non-Woven Facial &amp; Body Wax Strips]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006LSYPFQ Sally Hansen Zero Bumps Bikini Spray, 0.85 fl oz.]]</li>
    <li> I have no experience in waxing at all, but this kit was so easy to use!! For the price of 1 brazillian wax, you have like a year&#x27;s supply of wax. Tip: put it on the lowest heat when first heating up and stir occasionally. I put it on medium heat the first time and burned myself because it was WAY too hot. Also, get baby oil (or any other kind of oil) to help get rid of excess wax after!</li>
    <li> the warmer is impeccable but the wax breaks my girl&#x27;s skin out, hence still not saving money on a wax.  I wish she would find out what wax the waxer uses lol</li>
    <li> I waited to try it a few times until I gave a review. There&#x27;s definitely a happy medium for the wax temperature. Too cold and it&#x27;s hard to manage. That&#x27;s easy to determine and just needs to be heated a little longer. It&#x27;s harder to tell if it&#x27;s too hot. You want to be able to take a good amount of wax out with the applicator. If it&#x27;s too hot, the wax will just run off and cause a mess. It will also likely be uncomfortably hot on the skin. After learning how to get the temperature right, it was actually pretty easy to use and worked great.  The reason I gave 4 stars was because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a low enough setting to keep the wax warm once it&#x27;s melted. It takes a long time for it to heat up. Like other comments I&#x27;ve read, I try to notice when the outside is melted and the inside is still solid and then turn it to the lowest setting. But it will still eventually get hot. Sometimes you just might want to leave it be and comeback when it&#x27;s all melted. Turning it off works but takes longer for it to cool. I found that removing the metal container worked better for bringing it down to the temperature I want. It&#x27;s hot so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using your fingers.</li>
    <li> hard to use unless you are a professional</li>
    <li> I have waxed my bikini area for several years. It is hard to find that wax that works perfectly. I used to use nair brazillian wax, until they stopped selling the product that I like. I only like the hard wax. It is alot more easy to use than the strips! I also didnt like that i had to run back and forth to the microwave. So, when I saw that gigi had the hard wax AND a warmer, I had to try it out! I love this product!!! It saves so much time, running back and forth. And the hard wax is easy to use, once you get use to the right consistency.</li>
    <li> I got this a few months ago and have used it at least 10 times since then and I absolutely love it!  It is so much more cost effective to wax my own legs, etc. than to go to a service provider every time.  This wax warmer is incredibly simple to use, heats up very quickly, and is easy to clean.  I do not use any pre-epi oils/lotions/powders and my skin does fine with that, but some people may find it necessary to take some extra precautions.  Also, this warmer get VERY hot so be certain that your wax is at a safe temperature before using it.  I use an aloe lotion after waxing as opposed to any of the post-epi specific products.  My favorite wax is the All Purpose Honee, it goes on easily and lasts for a long time.  Hard wax does hurt less than strip wax, but the results are cleaner (as in no leftover hair OR wax on the skin) with strip wax, so if you can handle that, I recommend using a wax with muslin strips instead.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! I&#x27;ve wanted to try something like it forever, but I was too afraid of the potential pain. Obviously it&#x27;s not *fun* to rip hair out, but this makes it super easy and worth the minimal discomfort. It was no more painful than getting my eyebrows waxed. This is my favorite beauty find in a long time. Used to shave every day, now I can wait at least a week, if not significantly more (only have used it twice so far). A+!!</li>
    <li> Best kit ever!!!!!!! Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It definitely takes a little practice, but I&#x27;m really enjoying this kit. I&#x27;m not too thrilled with the pre epilation oil however. I feel that it makes my skin a little TOO slick for the wax to go on. I would have much rather had some of the wax removing oil included instead!</li>
    <li> This was very easy  to use even for a beginner. The DVD is VERY explicit so please don&#x27;t leave it laying around young boys unless you are ready for the talk.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again if i could, no more paying to get a wax professionally done. i am so thrilled I can do it myself now. LOVE this!</li>
    <li> The waxing container itself is great.  Heats up fast and does exactly what I intended it to.  The wax that comes with the kit on the other hand... Is terrible.  I followed the directions exactly and the wax stuck to my skin like crazy,  Even once I pulled the strip off, all the way around was left a wax border.  I eventually ended up trying to pick it off and decided to leave it to stick to my clothing for a couple days. Awesome... Anyway... I&#x27;ll be contacting the seller for a return.</li>
    <li> Easy to use! Love it to save on waxing and hard wax hurts less. Only thing would be to have one if the pre cleansing creams that it recommends in the video but so far so good without it. It does come with one pre oil cream and a soothing one after.</li>
    <li> First time for me to use wax&lt;br /&gt;It was really great experience&lt;br /&gt;I like it very vey much&lt;br /&gt;No pain</li>
    <li> This waxing kit is amazing! Why didn&#x27;t I get this sooner? It&#x27;s very easy to use and cheaper than going to the salon. If you&#x27;re doing a brazillian for the first time, I recommend you have someone help with application.</li>
    <li> This is hard wax kit (different from soft wax FYI. I learned the hard way) which is used for the &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34; that need waxing (aka bikini area, etc). I was ordering it to wax my husbands back, which this can be used for but the soft wax seems more appropriate and cost effective. But, this is nice and comes with a helpful DVD.</li>
    <li> I gotta get some practice but over all works good. I prefer the strips of paper rather then waiting for the wax to cool off. and I could never get a good grip to take it all off with one try. Also it might help to see the instructional dvd cause I didn&#x27;t watch it. And it does take over an hour to heat up</li>
    <li> It hurts more than I would have expected, but it works, which is important! It pulls hair really nicely, but the substance can be a bit too sticky if thinly applied. Had a bunch of it stuck to my skin for days before chipping it off and freezing it with ice.</li>
    <li> OK, being a guy I&#x27;ve never waxed anything and I&#x27;ve never shaved anything other than my face for the most part.  My wife wanted this kit so she could do an at home Brazilian.  According to the DVD that comes with it she did the Full Brazilian and I got a Sphinx.  I&#x27;ve never waxed anyone before and the instructions were very easy to understand.  Her waxing went painlessly as I used a good bit of wax and went PAST the patches of hair I could get a grip on the wax WITHOUT pulling the initial few hairs individually.  After you rip the wax off you have to apply pressure to the area to slightly relieve the pain.  As I stated before her waxing went flawless and painless.  She wanted to practice so I volunteered somewhat reluctantly and let her try it out.  3 Things to remember: 1) You have to wax PAST the hair to make a grip 2) apply PRESSURE after you rip the hair away  3) make sure you pull with enough force to rip it in ONE shot.  My wife did not do any of those 3 simultaneously so I am not ready to ever let her wax me again.  She on the other hand loves the results and is more than happy to let me wax her again and is looking forward to it.  I contemplated payback but I like the results too and I love the view when I get to wax her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a guy, WATCH THE DVD AND DO IT RIGHT!  You&#x27;ll thank me later!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two weeks since and there is little to no hair growth still.  Be sure you have tweezers to get the few strays that have awesome root in your skin (yes, there will be a few tough ones).  Other than that, you might want to get the spill sleeves.  It comes with only one.  It&#x27;s so you don&#x27;t get the warmer all waxed up.  Very great purchase overall.  Much much cheaper than going to a spa and getting it done.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I honestly do not think that I can say good enough things about this kit.  I got my first Brazilian wax by a professional (who actually works with GiGi) about two months ago.  About a week ago something came up and I missed my second wax appointment with her and she didn’t have any openings for another month, so I figured what the heck, I’ll just buy the same wax kit and ‘try’ to do it myself.  Well my kit came in two days and right away I opened it up and plugged it in.  Needless to say, I don’t think I’ll ever be returning to the wax queen because this kit makes waxing so simple!  It took me about an hour and twenty minutes to do a full Brazilian and honestly I think it was less painful then getting it done by a professional! I highly recommend this kit to anyone!</li>
    <li> It got to me very fast, much appreciated! Everything was new, sealed and unopened. It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Super deal, the product works as expected!</li>
    <li> great product! first time use and i&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> Works very well, is definately professional quality and for a good price can&#x27;t go wrong! can be used with any kind of wax I tried using hard wax and it was too intense so I tried another kind and this is a good brand!</li>
    <li> Okay so first off, I have never waxed before professionally or not. I bought this because my husband and I are pregnant with our first child and he wants to go to the beach this summer. I have not swam since I was 14 (I am 24) because when I shave my bikini I get a terrible rash, ingrown hairs, &amp; redness by the time I heal the hair has grown back again. (sorry if this is tmi lol) Anyway I decided to wax my armpit first, nothing on God&#x27;s green earth could have prepared me for the extreme pain that was about to ensue, i bleed in a lot of places, it hurt so badly I almost cried. I will never ever wax my armpit ever again. I applaud the women who can. So i tried my bikini, hurt SO much less, it was bearable, and for my first time I did not do too bad. Got  almost all of my hairs. I did bleed a little but nothing compared to my armpit lol. I gave this a 4 star rating because it was insanely hard to remove the small pieces of excess wax, like almost impossible. This kit really would be perfect if it included wax removing gel or whatever this brand sells. As I am writing this I still have some tiny pieces I could not remove in the shower. Will not be using the kit again until i purchase a wax remover. But I would defiantly recommend to a friend or family member. Overall I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Since it won&#x27;t allow my detailed review and it doesn&#x27;t have anything profane I will leave this at shouldn&#x27;t even have one star! I will try to add original review. ***My product was used. Pre oil and cooling gel were nearly gone (and didn&#x27;t spill in the package: the wax was also used.) No seal??? That&#x27;s disgusting. Buyer beware! I have used this brand in the past and liked it however I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this seller. Not hygienic at all. Trying to contact the seller. I will update review with their response</li>
    <li> Definitely had to get the hang of the wax and timing of taking the strip off. Overall works well take a while to warm the wax but I usually turn it on and go do some stuff around the house. Little to no pain.</li>
    <li> i was my first time using a gigi product, love the quality and the resonable price!! I&#x27;m gonna buy a again if i use it all!! love it! totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> For the price you are paying you can&#x27;t expect to get the highest quality. Actually the wax heater is very poor quality and it takes really long time to have the wax ready to use.  Won&#x27;t recomend it!.</li>
    <li> Bummed it did not come with the strips</li>
    <li> Works very well but does get extremely hot.  Be careful and read instructions before use.</li>
    <li> This is literally the best waxing kit EVER! When I first got the kit I was expecting soft wax (because I failed to read everything) but I have to say I like the hard wax a lot better. I use this kit to wax my bikini area.  It&#x27;s less painful and less messy, for me anyway. I&#x27;ve had this thing for a little over a month and I&#x27;ve waxed about 5 or 6 times and I still have wax left over! That&#x27;s another thing, I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t need to wax as often and my hair isn&#x27;t quite as thick which is also great!</li>
    <li> It really works. Whenever I use it I don&#x27;t need to worry about the hair growing back too soon like shaving</li>
    <li> I like this product. the heating element works really well and it comes with all the product so that your skin does not get irritated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I was really happy with it. It was my first time using a hot wax, and it definitely wasn&#x27;t easy or pain-free, but the video helped, as did the reviews I read on Amazon before buying the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although my first experience was far from perfect (I burned myself a little and dripped wax around various parts of my body and surrounding areas WAY more than intended), I know it will get easier (and less painful) with practice. In the end, I got the job done and I&#x27;m very happy that I&#x27;ll be saving lots of money moving forward (no more salon fees!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a better way to get all the bits of wax off from my skin and hands. That was probably the most annoying part of the whole experience - even through the following day I was picking at wax on my fingernails, etc.</li>
    <li> The DVD isn&#x27;t at all what I expected.  Not as informative.  I just read online, and got all the right info.  It does hurt!  So be prepared.  If you&#x27;ve had it done before you know that.  :)  Only thing I like better about the salon is it&#x27;s a lot quicker.  Rest assured the more you pull your hair out by the folical the less it hurts.  I&#x27;m in love with this...</li>
    <li> could have come with a better video on how to do it. It is a crappy video. it just shows how to heat the wax and set up. It needs to actually show you how to do the Brazilian for all you&#x27;re paying for it</li>
    <li> Best waxing system ever!</li>
    <li> gud deal.wax was not gud but warmer was gud</li>
    <li> Very Good product would bye again hurts just a little need to do it fast but love it recommend it</li>
    <li> This is the best investment considering how much i used to pay every 4-5 weeks to get waxed as opposed to how much this kit costed to do it myself,  plus i get so many uses of of it. It comes with a warmer which is awesome. The only thing i will need to buy more of are sticks and that&#x27;s no problem at all.  I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
    <li> This is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!  I did receive the product damaged (the lid was shattered) but, amazon quickly refunded me some of the cost (I think like $11 or so) which was nice.  I have this warmer set up right on my counter in the bathroom.  The actual hard wax is so nice to wax with as it hurts a lot LESS than wax with the strips you place over.  It is really nice!  The hard wax does not adhere to your skin and pull your skin – it pulls the hairs only.  A lot of people complain about this being ‘messy’ but, once you get the hang of it, it isn’t messy anymore!  Here are a few tips:&lt;br /&gt;- Set a paper towel or cloth down underneath your warmer and around the counter you will be waxing by, also on the ground in case you do drip&lt;br /&gt;  the wax… it makes for easier clean up!&lt;br /&gt;- Plug the warmer in about 20 minutes prior to waxing&lt;br /&gt;- Put on rubber gloves for the first few wax sessions – until you get the hang of it and you do not require them anymore.  This makes clean up&lt;br /&gt;  WAY easier&lt;br /&gt;- Have everything set out prior to starting (your before and after lotion, tweezers, scissors if needed, your popsicle sticks, some cotton balls or&lt;br /&gt;  cloth to apply the after oil/lotion)&lt;br /&gt;- After the wax is completely melted – set the warmer to ‘warm’ and let it cool down for about 10 minutes.  YOU DO NOT WANT THE WAX&lt;br /&gt;  TO BE RUNNY!!! If it is, it will be really messy and more than likely burn your skin.  You want the wax to be a little thinner than honey!  &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the above steps, your process will be that much easier.</li>
    <li> I was worried that my money wouldn&#x27;t be worth it but I was wrong. I wanted to try waxing for the first time and read great reviews about this product that definitely proved itself to be true. The warmer it comes with sets it at the right temperature to ensure I don&#x27;t get badly burnt. I can tell the wax is good quality too because there was rarely instances of the wax breaking. Definitely an investment that&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this kit. I&#x27;ve waxed my Brazilion area three times so far and the wax is over half full. Real easy to use. Great product</li>
    <li> Exactly as described all my contents came in perfect condition. Use lots of the oil! If u don&#x27;t it will feel like it&#x27;s glued to your skin and not coming off but when I&#x27;m oiled up I have very little pain and it comes right up. I put a lot on rub it in let it sink in the lightly brushed over where I was applying wax with a rag or paper towel to get some oil off the hair follicle.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and everything in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I checked into Sally, and this is a way better deal than you are going to get anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Gigi is an amazing product &amp; you can&#x27;t beat this price!!!</li>
    <li> Loved it. Id recommend buying strips to use over the wax, make it easier on yourelf. Strips aren&#x27;t needed. Removes baby hair and up to thick hair well. worth it!</li>
    <li> Instructions were easy to follow and the DVD was very helpful. Plus thanks to all the other reviews, very insightful.</li>
    <li> Love the warmer although I would never recommend the hard wax it makes the process way more painful than the honne wax.</li>
    <li> works great! But I tried on my brows and made me breakout so I will have to purchase a sensitive type wax! This wax it too thick for brows but works well for bikini area!</li>
    <li> It is less painful than the other type.</li>
    <li> Good quality wax, a really nice starter kit.  My one complaint is that it takes quite a while for the full container of wax to melt down, which you really need to do with hard wax.  Of course this won&#x27;t be a problem once there&#x27;s less wax and more room to stir, but in the mean time I have to take extra precaution with stirring to ensure the wax doesn&#x27;t spill over the sides (like I used to do with my soft wax warmer, which eventually got so sticky it was relegated to a shoe box [which I suggest using, lined with aluminum foil, as a container for your warmer and supplies before things get out of hand]).</li>
    <li> The machine took three hours to heat the wax.</li>
    <li> it is perfect for strong heavy hair , but absolutely not good for soft small hair (leg or hand). thanks</li>
    <li> Love this kit, comes with everything you need, although I would recommend regular wax for unexperienced waxers as opposed to the hard wax that it comes with. Fast shipping and item as described!</li>
    <li> I really like it, it&#x27;s very clean and easy to use! I also like the wax because it doesn&#x27;t produce any weird bruning smell.</li>
    <li> Simple  to use . Everything you need to start to finish.</li>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t like the hard wax. Ill stick with GiGi honey wax I think.</li>
    <li> Works great and can&#x27;t beat the price! Gonna save  about $720 a year and I can do it when I have time at home rather than making an appointment!</li>
    <li> The wax cover was broken when it arrived. It made me bleed and I had to tweeze off alot of left over hair. However,  it did a great job on my husband&#x27;s underarm. His hair came off clean with no bleeding and no left overs, I&#x27;m jealous. It probably had to do with hair type and length? His hair was much longer and my skin is alot more sensitive due to me being pregnant. The wax was easy to use and wasnt to much of a mess for me. I gave it 3 stars because I had alot of left overs and one of the contents were broken when it arrived. I guess the results are different for everybody..</li>
    <li> Yes, it does remove every single hair. I have been using this product by boiling hard wax in a boiling pot.&lt;br /&gt;BECAUSE THEY SENT ME THE BROKEN WAX WARMER. The light turns into green. but the wax warmer stays cold no matter how many hours I turn the warmer on. Very disappointed. I had to throw away bc wax was overflowing and hardened.</li>
    <li> So glad I ordered this!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the lid came cracked, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to send it back.  The wax warmer is a life saver, it keeps the wax at the perfect temperature.  The wax comes off very easily and doesn&#x27;t stick to skin like soft wax does. Learning to wax at home (especially the bikini area) is for sure a learning experience and it will take a while to really get it down.  On that note, here&#x27;s some advice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Watch the DVD (and some youtube videos), and if you can get professionally waxed at least once.  Watch them carefully and notice all the little tricks they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s going to be messy, especially the first time.  I sat on my bathroom floor with an old hand mirror (I got wax all over it) and a sheet on the floor.  Keep the trash can nearby for your applicator sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Whether you use the oil the kit comes with or baby powder (I use powder because it&#x27;s what they use at my waxing place), don&#x27;t skimp.  The wax won&#x27;t really adhere to skin but it will come off much easier with the oil/powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Hold your skin as taut as possible when pulling the wax off. If your skin is not taut, the wax wont come off cleanly.  I had to experiment with positions for the more delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Less is more!  Keep the wax as thin as possible while still covering all the hair.  It actually grabs more hair that way and is way easier to remove. If your wax is too thick the top will be too cool and the bottom will still be sticky, so it will break and be stringy at the same time when you try to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use this kit it will be messy and imperfect.  But $45 for probably at least 6 months worth of waxing (probably closer to a year) is a great bargain.  Be patient, have fun, and happy waxing!</li>
    <li> This kit is great for someone who is used to being waxed! However I&#x27;ve never been waxed before and underestimated how painful it was going to be, I couldn&#x27;t finish the job because it hurt too bad. The next day I had a rash that looked and felt like razer burn. So I doubt I will be using it again for that area, but it worked great for my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> This product is really great, it works amazing, the oils are great for the before and after, for the price i recommend the product, very high quality.</li>
    <li> It works fine but the oils didn&#x27;t come</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all, and this kit has been the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for hair removal downstairs. Adding extra wax is a big no no with soft wax, and creates an impossible mess that practically requires a can WD-40 to clean up. I really like that with this product, if you don&#x27;t get enough wax on an area, you can build it up by just adding more on top, and be able to remove hairs without all the excess pulling! The strip-less application and removal made for a lot less mess, and I was able to wax with complete confidence. I am a new addict to the Gigi hard wax, and I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
    <li> This product is not really good, this just worked the first time (where took me like an hour to let it work) and every time it takes mooooore and mooooore time. I just want to give it back....</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money, time and effort. I rather spend the money at the spa and have waxing done there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the kind of product I was looking for but it was too messy.&lt;br /&gt;My nails had too much wax. I have to find a better way to do it again.</li>
    <li> Works well. Takes some finesse, but once you get a rhythm, it works well. Though I can&#x27;t say I feel a difference between the amount of pain with the strips vs. the hard wax when it comes to my bikini wax. But it definitely cuts down on the inflammation.</li>
    <li> I have never waxed on my own before, and much to my surprise, this was very easy to figure out and use. This kit includes everything that I needed. Of course, after doing it a few times it does get easier. The only down fall I have found is that you need to plan ahead, the red bumps and some irritation was present for about 3-4 days after waxing. Feeling much more confident in a swimming suit and saving money on top of it!!</li>
    <li> Worked great! Didn&#x27;t hurt much at all. Can be used all over.. I expected worse. Make sure you use the oil that&#x27;s included or you&#x27;ll be sorry!</li>
    <li> I refuse to go get waxed again! I wax myself!! Saves me so much money and is a huge blessing!! Love this thing!!</li>
    <li> the box was looking nice at first, after i opened it i realized that it is wet. the heater, CD everything was in oil. Apparently one of the oil bottles was opened, of course there is nothing left in the bottle, because it is all over the box. Why couldn&#x27;t you simply close it before you sent.  Very disappointing !!!</li>
    <li> I like it befor you star waxing pre heat for couple hours or more then turn it down to low it works and you don&#x27;t get burn to take off wax from your hands put some baby oil before you star waxing don&#x27;t try to scratch it off your skins go to bed the next day it will be off. I like to know what&#x27;s the difference hard wax and soft wax ? Please help</li>
    <li> No problems with the product, just have one set back. When I got it in the mail and opened the package. The lid to the machine cracked. Was a little disappointed but nothing that glue can&#x27;t handle.</li>
    <li> Great!  Came quickly, and easy to use!  Would recommend to anyone looking to use waxing at home.</li>
    <li> For a first time waxer it was ok, but very messy. It also leaves the wax on your skin, and all over fingers. I followed the directions, but still didn&#x27;t work that well. I tried my other leg using cloth strips, and I felt it didn&#x27;t hurt as bad. The only thing is, is that the wax wouldn&#x27;t always stay on the cloth. As for the bikini area..... I used the cloth with the wax, and seemed ok.</li>
    <li> Hurts like a mother, but that&#x27;s expected. The kit is nice. I ordered additional sticks. Wish the wax would melt evenly. Wax says it takes 45 mins to melt...more like an hour or more.</li>
    <li> Easy to use perfect machine, but no waxing strips.....got the machine and had to place another oder for the waxing strips</li>
    <li> Dont buy this product.Its more sticky and wax removal is not working properly.Once it is sticked ti any thing u need to spend more hrs to remove the wax.Its like a fevicol.</li>
    <li> Will never use any other type of wax and the wax warmer is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> it took me a few tries but once i got the hang of it i fell in love.  the only  unfortunate thing was that i was hoping to be the exception when it came to the oil spill everyone has experienced, unfortunately I&#x27;m never a lucky person, so my box was oily, who cares.  high quality results!!  i will defiantly be referring my friends!</li>
    <li> Great set and great price.  Love that it comes with so much.</li>
    <li> I cant bring myself to do my Brazilians myself yet, but this works great for underarms too! With underarm waxes being about $20 each, this more than pays for itself on just the second use, and the first if you do a Brazilian.</li>
    <li> Love this kit. It&#x27;s perfectly designed and it&#x27;s a good deal for that money. Gigi has amazing products and great quality.</li>
    <li> I bought the kit after reading the reviews many times (good and bad) but I figured I&#x27;d have to try it myself to really have an opinion and being so sick of shaving I just went for it and order it on April 20, 2015 Sold by: Think Fast...wanted to try it several times before writing a review...I can tell you, this is my new best friend!! It is very easy to use, instructions are clear but I also looked on youtube for a how to use video here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;DNdVkvixtcc). This was also my first time with hard wax and doing it myself. I started with my underarms and got them done in 45 mins and now I&#x27;m down to 30mins. This really pulls the hair from its roots, at the end, only some very thin, hard to get hairs are left which I pull with the tweezers, like they show in the video, and then apply the cooling gel. It also worked beautifully in my bikini area. Now, I wax once a week to keep myself clean and smooth ;) Some people in other reviews mentioned that the wax was green but mine was a honey color and there was nothing strange with it.  Tips based on my experience: - of course, do wax after the shower when skin is clean and hair is soft. - apply the wax and pull it after 1 min or so. It would be hard enough to trap the hair but flexible enough to pull. If you leave it too long it would be too hard and it will start breaking into pieces instead of coming all at once, it will be painful to take the pieces off. - don&#x27;t apply a very thin layer of wax, I found it grabbed more hair if the layer was a little thicker (not too thick, you&#x27;ll have to find what works best for you) Hope it works for you...</li>
    <li> Love this thing. It&#x27;s saved me a lot of money and time getting waxed at a salon. Definitely use the &amp;#34;pre-epilation oil&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product is just as described. All you need for home use; no additional products needed.&lt;br /&gt; No issues at all. Delivered on time. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Does the job, very handy. Soft wax is better than hard though. Easier and faster.</li>
    <li> My unit came with a broken lid.  This lid is used to cover the wax and keep it clean for future use.  I had purchased this unit at a beauty supply store and it worked great.  However, the wax on this kit hardens on the face before I could apply the waxing strip.  I had to pull the wax off using my hand.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Instructions were so easy to follow and I&#x27;ve found it to be so easy to use and no mess!</li>
    <li> The product is very good!! But I had problems with the delivery.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of using this. It always ended up in a big mess.</li>
    <li> This has everything you need besides the baby powder. Other than that it works great! Has instructions in a DVD and if that&#x27;s isn&#x27;t useful for your brazilian wax just look more videos on YouTube(I found some helpful ones). Besides the wax sometimes breaking on me it still removes most of your hair:) which is the best part!! Enjoy...</li>
    <li> This product is hard to use and time consuming.It took more than 2 hours to apply and remove but also I could not take out the particles of wax on my legs,nails,clothes till next morning.End of the procedure wax noodle was everywhere and some of the hair still remains on legs .More than half of wax was over just for below knees.Gigi warmer which was very neat at beginning got coated by wax at the end.</li>
    <li> This wax system seemed perfect, yet the warmer (at least mine) did not stay on the high setting in addition one the wax did melt the low setting didnt maintain the temp but instead felt as though it was getting even hotter. I am extremely disappointed I was so excited when I purchsed I told everone yet this warmer is far from a good deal.</li>
    <li> This kit is great, but I couldn&#x27;t handle the pain.  The container of wax is an ample amount for plenty of waxing.  The amount and size of the sticks were great.  The DVD was very helpful as this was my first attempt at a Brazilian.  First timers should probably do a lot of reading and make sure they know what they&#x27;re doing... don&#x27;t get a glob of wax stuck like I did. Talk about pain!  I also purchased the trial kit of lotions to use in addition to what was provided. The warmer seemed to be made of light plastic but it held up very well to the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure I&#x27;ll use this again, just not soon... at least not on the bikini area.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff. It worked really well and came with easy to follow written instructions and a dvd that actually shows how to use it, my boyfriend thought it was a piece of cake. I only used about a quarter of the wax it for the full monty so I expect to get at least 4 uses out of it, probably more. The price is great if you consider that it usually costs at least $50 to get this done professionally, making this is a way better deal. Plus I will be able to use most of the items for more than four uses and will just need to reorder the wax, not the whole kit.</li>
    <li> Watch the video have some wine with your partner and have at it.  This kit works just as advertised!  A must for a perfectly hairless area.</li>
    <li> I really love this wax, it allows me to wax at home, I have used it on my bikini area, my face and under my arms with no problems.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Gigi Brazilian waxing kit after trying their microwave Brazilian bikini hard wax thinking that the products would be similar but they were not. This formula has a thinner consistency which made application a little tricky. I&#x27;m new to waxing at home so someone with more experience may have an easier time with it. I was able to get the wax to work better by setting my warmer to low for the entire melting process and applying 2 to 3 coats on area to be waxed. I found that 2 coats often resulted in torn strips that were more painful to pull than thicker ones. On the other hand, the thinner consistency allowed me to &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; a few times and use wax strips for harder to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with Gigi&#x27;s pre-hon as well as pre epilation oil. I loved both products and would purchase them again separately in future. To remove excess wax, I used my coconut oil and jumped back in the shower for final removal. Overall, this was a great value buy since the warmer alone costs the same amount as the entire kit at local brick and mortar stores. I will continue to look for a hard wax with a thicker consistency to use with my warmer.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a wax that works really well....this is definitely it. Definitely have someone help you, this isn&#x27;t a great solo project product. I&#x27;ve only ever waxed at home, not at a salon so I don&#x27;t know what the pain is with this compared to at a salon. I can tell you that this didn&#x27;t rip my skin off at all but the pain was so bad it felt like all my skin was being ripped off. I couldn&#x27;t finish it hurt so bad but if you don&#x27;t mind pain, this for sure works. I think I&#x27;m realizing waxing just isn&#x27;t my thing, razors for no pain it is.</li>
    <li> Wax is a little thin and therefore had to rip off.</li>
    <li> i am used to waxing, i did not expect to ever get a rash like that! It is the worst i ever had, my skin looks like burnt though i know the temperature was right. its itchy everywhere and now the whole set needs to be trashed!</li>
    <li> Love it! Saves me tons of $$!</li>
    <li> Everything was good... it came on time, it worked, and everything was in the package! Why I gave it three stars? Because the top was cracked. They need better packaging</li>
    <li> Helpful tip- if you&#x27;re doing this on tile floor put some baby oil on the ground where you will be sitting.  Cleanup is so much easier if you do that!  This stuff sucks to get out of towels, etc so you could use paper towels under you if you are worried about your floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DVD is very helpful, I have never been professionally waxed, nor seen it done, and I had no trouble learning how to do this.  It definitely gets easier with practice, but it is not hard for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy tongue depressors to use when the limited amount of applicators run out.  You can even get &#x27;em in bulk on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work on making a &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; at the end of the wax for easy pulling.  It can save you tons of frustration. You can kind of swirl the wax back where you started it to make a lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days after you wax, exfoliate a bit to prevent ingrowns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used soft wax all the time and I find that using hard wax is definitely easier and less messy. If you let the wax cool down for too long, it will be difficult to peel it off. The same holds true if the application is too thin. With a thick application, yank the wax off when it turns a little pale in color and you will get a totally non-messy super good wax experience. I&#x27;ve used this only on lips, chin, underarms and legs until now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago, and have loved it. Paying $42 for brazilians (I have payed up to  $65) was becoming pretty pricey. I ordered this kit, used it, and cancelled my next appointment. I am still working on getting it just right (I have problems with thickness levels), but I am very happy with this product. The wax is disappearing very fast, but the replacements are less than $11. I am not perfect at this yet, but I am better off pulling wax off at my speed with less pain (I&#x27;ve had waxers pull the wax so slow), and cleaning the residue off myself (they have left residue and i felt very awkward walking around after), than paying someone the expensive service fee and a tip for something I haven&#x27;t been completely happy with.</li>
    <li> By no means am I a professional waxer, but this product is easy enough for me to use on my armpits.  Since I&#x27;m not an experienced self-waxer, it did take a few tries to get the job done and maybe a bit of tweezing after, overall I&#x27;m really satisfied with Gigi.  I also had one heck of a mess, but I think with experience, it&#x27;ll get better.  The wax doesn&#x27;t stick to my skin and it doesn&#x27;t hurt very much at all.  I do get my bikini waxed professionally so I&#x27;m used to the pain associated with waxing.  However, I would stick with just using this for legs and armpits.  Leave the sensitive bits to the professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a pain to clean off of counters and floors if it dries, so cover your surfaces prior to use and if you do get some on it, clean it up while it&#x27;s still pliable.</li>
    <li> im not sure if its this specific model, but i have one at work and it heats up fine. but i got this one and my friend got the same one and both of ours take hours to heat up...other wise it works great</li>
    <li> All items arrived intact, and got here extremely fast! I have super tough hair and sensitive skin, which make for a loose loose scenario when waxing. This stuff was amazing though! It took a few times to get a system going, but it works better than anything I&#x27;ve used before. There was minimal pain and massive results. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> my wife was super excited about this and i think she used it 3 times then it just collected dust and she went back to shaving because i guess this thing was just too much of a hassle for her... too much of a strain on her busy life that she uses to sit at home on the internet while im at work 14 hours a day and cleaning and doint all the stuff she was too busy to do when i come home from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my wife tried to wax me down there once using this thing but she got tired of it half way through so that was a fun couple months with my continuity down there. for what its worth... half of my downstairs will confirm that it does indeed work very well and is very lasting.</li>
    <li> Great product at an amazing price ! Highly recommend this set ! One bikini wax at the salon is way more pricey than this with everything alone</li>
    <li> Great price :) other then cracked lib its amazing :)</li>
    <li> The wax took TWO hours to heat and then only stuck to the skin without coming off on the strips, even after placing the strip on the wax immediately!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The worst waxing experience ever!!! Do NOT buy this product, since you can&#x27;t even return it!!!!</li>
    <li> not only is the warmer small (nice for people like me with small bathrooms) but the wax is fabulous! Better yet the tin of it lasts at least a month and a half (and I do brazillian, legs, stomach and underarms so that is definitely saying something)</li>
    <li> This is great. It comes with everything that you need as a starter kit and I love it. I use it for my underarms and it just takes the hair away. I great alternative for those who don&#x27;t want to shave their underarms.</li>
    <li> It will melt the wax! Some on the market will not get hot enough to melt the wax completely and that is disgusting with paying for a unit to melt wax.&lt;br /&gt;I maybe should have gotten a wax that would have the honey in it for facial use. I had to be very careful to put thick and roll that off...no cloth needed as it would not stick to the wax.  It thickened too fast for cloth. Will do honey wax next time but this is fast. Just be careful to not hurt your skin with the solid wax. I&#x27;m new to this one...it probably is more for the bikini waxing but  if I get the proper wax, I will be very happy with this unit.</li>
    <li> gigi is basically what they are using in most places, and usually it is gigi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is better than the soft wax and lotion waxes, its on and off, dries quick and it pulls off just a quick. let it dry just right or youll have to get a few stragglers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while and love it. I&#x27;ll actually need to reorder soon but I&#x27;ve used it on my brows as well and love that I don&#x27;t have to pay to go in and have them done every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t open and tried it yet, but will be sure to let you know how it work. I know many who have this product and they seemed to thoroughly enjoy having this product. They mentioned they have not had any issues with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit on a whim and am so glad that I did.  I had never tried waxing before but was sick of my other methods of hair removal, specifically in the armpit area as I was always getting razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a couple of uses I can already tell that I&#x27;m getting more adept at this system.  Here are a few of my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turn on the system in the middle of the day on high and let it heat up (the time this takes varies depending upon how much wax you have left in the can).  When it&#x27;s quite runny I turn it on low and wait until it thickens a bit to start the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collars are a must so keep some extras on hand.  They are a great place to lay the applicator while you&#x27;re waiting for the wax to dry and they also keep your machine from being draped in wax by the end of a session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the larger paddles are the best for me as the bigger the swath of wax I can apply at once &#x3D; larger area of hair removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the person who said to start on the &amp;#34;outskirts&amp;#34; where there is no hair:  THANK YOU.  This is the truth.  Start the wax out a bit past the hair line so you can lift up an edge and get the &amp;#34;tear away&amp;#34; process started before the real hairs are pulled up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes pulling against the growth of the hair isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s going to get the hairs out (especially true in the armpit area) so wait a few moments, reapply the wax and try again, pulling they wax in the opposite direction, if you see that the hair didn&#x27;t come out the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have gel nails, USE GLOVES.  This stuff can wreck gel polish and probably regular polish too.  I use medical latex gloves and they work fine.  If you do get some gel on your polish, wait until it dries before trying to pick it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the first time I do an area is the most painful.  The armpits were THE WORST.  But every subsequent time has been less painful.  Also the hair seems to grow in softer so maybe that&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is any residual wax left it will pick up the colors of the clothing fibers you wear.  For instance if you do your bikini line and wear black undies and PJ pants that night, the residual wax will be black the next day.  Worth mentioning if you do the wax one day and are expecting to be seen naked that night...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am medium skin toned and have only slightly sensitive skin and I get a considerable amount of red, bubbled up skin after a waxing session.  By the next morning it has lessened greatly and it&#x27;s gone within two days time.  Again worth mentioning if you intend to be seen naked that night...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any residual wax does come off on its own after a couple of days time and a couple of showers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this kit has been great.  I recently tried waxing my upper lip and it worked just fine there too.  Will keep buying replacement cans!of the clothing fibers you wear.

    <li> This product is overall a good one. I&#x27;ve never waxed before so I tried it on myself and my guy also took his turn on me. Personally I find the DVD useless (unless you&#x27;re starting up a business and not just using this for home use), I ended up looking up a tutorial on youtube and found this one to be very helpful [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself takes about an hour to get melted and warm so be prepared for that (it comes in a metal container so microwaving isn&#x27;t an option like I&#x27;d hoped). Also if you want to do large areas, this may not be the best choice. The waxing strips seem to be the better way to go because application of hard wax pieces is time consuming (esp if you&#x27;re a rookie like me) and not all the hairs come out... however with time and practice it will work well :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes as pictured with a ton of application sticks as well as the oil and post application lotion. When I got my kit the cap on the oil was partly unscrewed and half of the oil was in the box O_O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warmer itself works well and once you&#x27;re wax is melted its best to put it on medium and stir the wax a bit so you don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;molten lava\\&quot; effect that another reviewer was talking about (unless yours is as defective as hers was...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a neat little kit and it functions as it should. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars since I know a lot of its issues are likely the cause of my rookie mistakes but the useless DVD, the open bottle of oil and the long wait time for the wax to heat up makes this a 4 star product in my book.</li>
    <li> Third time buying this kit, and would purchase a 4th time, works great. Dropped it once and it cracked but still worked! great price i even replaced it because it was really dirty. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this kit.</li>
    <li> The plastic lid was already cracked</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this waxing kit -- in fact, I liked it a lot when I first got it and used it. The warmer works well, the wax tore off tons of hair once I watched the video a few times and got the technique down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 3 hours later, however, I was in allergic contact dermatitis hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get skin irritation, rashes, welts, etc. from bandaids, plasters, bandage adhesive, medical tape, or whatever else is similar, or rosin, colophony, etc., do NOT use the Brazilian Hard Body Wax that comes with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get bad rashes and angry, red, raised welts from most self-stick bandages and medical tape. I had no idea that usually the culprit is the sticky rosin or colophony that causes the reaction. That also happens to be the #1 ingredient in this hard wax. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily as a waxing noobie, I only practiced a little on 1 leg and then did both underarms and a bit on one side of my face before I got tired. If I&#x27;d have gone for the gusto with an actual brazilian, I&#x27;d probably be writing this from the hospital. My entire face turned red, hot, and itchy, including my ears, behind my ears, and some of my neck. My armpits are mostly flaring around the edges -- where the hair was thickest and my skin the wrinkliest was luckily spared. My leg took a day to break out in a rash, but now I&#x27;ve got lots of mottled skin, red marks, and pinpricks that are probably from scratching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wind up reacting to this wax, my advice is to self-medicate with Benadryl internally and hydrocortisone 1% topically. I kept myself in a self-indued semi-coma, sleeping the better part of 2 days with the help of Benadryl. I applied hydrocortisone to all irritated areas 4 times a day (sometimes more, if it was really itchy.) There are creams, sprays, liquid rollerballs, and cooling hydrocortisone forumlas -- I&#x27;ve been using various combinations of all 4 to keep my scratching to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be proceeding to an allergist and/or dermatologist as soon as I can get someone to fit me in. Until then, I&#x27;ll be hoping Gigi makes a rosin-free hard wax, and staying away from people since I look blotchy, am still hairy, and smell horrible. :( Hopefully my experience can help others avoid the same fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gigi -- PLEASE start putting a disclaimer on your product that people with adhesive or rosin allergies should not use this stuff! I watched the video and read the booklet and had no idea what I was in for until it was too late and I was googling to figure out whether or not to go to the ER.ogist as soon as I can get someone to fit me in.

    <li> Where are my 10 edge covers? I received just 1 waxing kit box without any edge applicator set.</li>
    <li> Works very well!  I am very happy with how the perished performed.  Instructions were a little vague but the DVD puts it all together. BUT DO NOT overheat the wax. If it gets too liquidy turn the unit off and let it cool before applying otherwise it will be a nightmare.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone I normally got bikini waxes at a salon and they didn&#x27;t do a great job and I ended up paying too much. With this kit my boyfriend helped wax me and did a better job than a salon. If you&#x27;re looking for a good price and good hard wax I suggest this.</li>
    <li> Nice, but doesn&#x27;t come with wax removal strips ;{</li>
    <li> I am used to getting a brazillian wax every six weeks but it was getting expensive to maintain. Based on the reviews I took a chance on this kit. And  I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I found that its easier to use strips with the wax, although, it&#x27;s not necessary because the wax can be pulled off in its own. It took me about 2 hours to finish my wax the first time. Mostly because I kept hesitating when it came time to pull off the wax. I&#x27;ve went on to use the wax in other places like my armpits, legs, stomach, ect. And it works well. Good luck to all!</li>
    <li> The exact same kit that my salon uses (and charges me $$$ for!!). I love this-- it was super easy to use and very high quality.</li>
    <li> Awesome.il definitely recommend it for those who wanted to be super clean N tidy.just need a little more practice to get good hands on.</li>
    <li> This is great, to me it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as a waxing paper would and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It no joke it hurt but the little hairs on my lip still haven&#x27;t grown back much and i waxed probably 4-5 weeks ago when i first bought it :) hope they don&#x27;t grow back at all</li>
    <li> Tried this hair removal product with help of girl friend. On HIGH setting wax was REALLY hot on the skin. On lower settings not effective at all. Using epi paper was not the professional touch needed either. Whether applied thick or thin, the pull off was never a quick one tug pull. The paper broke along with the Brazil wax and then turned SO hard on the skin, removal was a chore, not a home salon delight. I only tried it on my hairy back. I cant imagine what it would be like as a bikini waxer... GF said, NO THANKS!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;nuff said?  Now I&#x27;m stuck with it: bad impulse purchase, I think.</li>
    <li> In a starter kit there should be a wax remover  for the residue that remains on skin.There was no indication that I needed this until I finished waxing.  It was fantastic in removing hair...however I had wax residue and had no post epilation lotion to remove residue. I easily solved it by using some olive oil though. This is a very good kit for a beginner.</li>
    <li> this wax is good for beginners, although im still learning on how to pull hard wax. the actual wax is great!</li>
    <li> I opened this to find that it was completely broken it many places. then i plugged it in and it started smoking a ton and smelling like fire.  not happy when i pay money for something and then wait for it (it came late as well) and then its broken when it arrives. the packaging was completely fine so it didnt happen during shipping.</li>
    <li> I love waxing at home now. It saves me so much cash - over $80 every six weeks is just too expensive for a working student like me. I would definitely recommend to any lady who is confident she can do the brazilian waxing on her own.</li>
    <li> This kit is a great value. The issues I had in the beginning were due to lack of practice. You will get better the longer you use it. I did take the other reviews advise and trace the cardboard collar onto another sheet of thin cardboard, but I haven&#x27;t had the need to cut it out yet. I leave my can of wax in the warmer with the lid off and just keep the brown plastic top on the warmer until I need to heat it up so the original collar is still there. Easy peasy! And MUCH cheaper than going to get waxed in a salon!</li>
    <li> Works just as hard wax should. Only gave 4 stars because when it arrived the pre oil bottle had all leaked out.</li>
    <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t take all the hair off, it&#x27;s messy, takes forever and doesn&#x27;t spread well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not being using it again.</li>
    <li> The warmer, gel, sticks etc are great. However the hard wax is terrible. I highly recommend purchasing the Gigi honey wax instead!</li>
    <li> Seriously far exceeded my expectations-- It glides on easily, and all the hair comes off (and I have thick hair) so I don&#x27;t have to keep putting wax back on.  Ordered and got the hang of it just in time for laying by the pool season.</li>
    <li> Yup it&#x27;s as great as they say. I use this the first time on my armpits bikini area and the legs. To me it wasn&#x27;t that painful but I know everyone is different. The cost value in itself is so much better than paying $80 for a leg wax. I can&#x27;t wait to use it more. I wasn&#x27;t able to remove a lot on my legs but I seem to recall that issue before.if anyone has tips for this please let me know.</li>
    <li> I really recommend it. This easy to use,  works very well and the results were that I was expected as a Brazilian style.I have saved money using this every month. I suggest to use the hard wax. It is better than others.</li>
    <li> First time waxing and it was super easy to use.  My skin is very sensitive and I typically break out whenever I go to the salon.  I figured I would give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Painless and left my skin super smooth.  It comes with the warmer, wax, paper liner so you don&#x27;t get wax on the warmer, sticks, pre &amp; post creamers.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Save so much money by not going to the salon. I see this exact waxing set used by several salons.</li>
    <li> Well it wasn&#x27;t totally the products fault but this was a disaster. My husband and i did this at home on me, not only did we have wax everywhere, i only ended up with about half of my hair gone and no in the important places. I would recommend just going and having it done professionally.</li>
    <li> it arrived in a very timely manor and is very user friendly. it keeps the wax at perfect temperature and heats up quickly after it has been off.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  My wife loves it, easy to use and does a great job!  Would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Complicated to use, waste of time, not efficient, hurt like hell so messy to clean up. Cant wax all my hair. Say gudbye frm now</li>
    <li> This waxing kit works well -- if you can handle doing this to yourself.  Not that you need to by the muslin strips separately.  Use the creams and oils, so you don&#x27;t tear you skin off.</li>
    <li> Love it. Same thing they have at the salon I go to.</li>
    <li> What a disappointing purchase. Product came damaged, the lid was cracked, also missing three types of applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is more - they do not accept returns! Just wow...</li>
    <li> Great product. It showed up on time and I&#x27;ve had job problems what so ever with this. Exactly what is shown and described is what you will recieve. It is just as gentle as promised and honestly I find that it doesn&#x27;t even hurt. It&#x27;s so gentle actually I use it on my eyebrows and those pesky dark upper lip hairs. This is a great product and if you ate thinking about getting it, do it!</li>
    <li> This is great! A little tricky at first but when you figure it out it works pretty well. Only downside is they don&#x27;t give you anything to get left over wax off. I had leftovers from a different wax kit luckily.</li>
    <li> Such a great hard waxing kit! Tried it the first day i got it, the wax taxes about 45 min to heat up. It comes with lotions and wooden sticks for applying it to your skin. Super easy to use, just watched a couple videos on how to do a hard wax on my legs and it was very easy. So much better than using the wax with the strips, this wax gets all of your hair removed in one rip.</li>
    <li> Did not realize this system does not require strips which was a nice surprise.  Would recommend for home and personal use.</li>
    <li> One of the oil bottles where open in the kit...I&#x27;m talking the lid was completely off the bottle.  I was everywhere in the kit.  Since it is a non-refundable product I contacted Amazon and they refunded my purchase immediately.  Customer service was amazing.  I am very happy with Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, as described and fast shipping.  First time using this product and brazillisn waxing; went rather smoothly.  Minor discomfort, underarms and bikini area is flawless.</li>
    <li> The oil was spilled all over the box when received. Otherwise, it would have been a four star product.</li>
    <li> Works great! The oil, and after gel that it comes with is also great! I will never pay for waxing again!</li>
    <li> Yes this is messy, and yes it will hurt like a b**ch the first few times you try it, but I promise you it is well worth it. I&#x27;m super happy with the results, though I have no sign sensitives. Not a five star product because of the mess, but nothing&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I love the wax, it is great quality and the only one I use, but I was greatly disappointed by what actually came in the mail, it arrived just today. When I opened the package, everything was covered in oil.  As others have mentioned in previous reviews, the cap of the pre-epilation oil was not fully closed and the contents were emptied, coating the heating unit, the wooden sticks, the wax, basically everything in the box. That was okay, I didn&#x27;t buy this kit for the oil, I bought it for the heating unit and wax. While the oil leaking was a true inconvenience, having the labels/markings on the heating unit rubbed off really drove the lack of quality control in. I have to guess where low, medium, and high is, which is do-able but I&#x27;d rather not have to and really, I shouldn&#x27;t have to. But it works at least.</li>
    <li> It says complete wax kit, so I assumed this meant that they included the strips but they do not include any at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months and It has already paid for itself multiple times over. I have done a full Brazilian wax 3 times and armpit wax 2 times and it is still more than halfway full. Typically at a salon I would pay over 40 dollars to get one Brazilian wax. What really makes this product stand out among other wax kits is the quality. It actually grips and removes hair with ease. Several times in the past I would try hard wax kits or kits specially made for coarse hairs and would end up with a waxy mess and not being able to complete what I started. Wax kits are only economical if they can replace your trips to the esthetician, and I would always end up going to finish what I couldn&#x27;t do myself. Right now, after doing my own (FULL) brazilian wax about 3-4 times, it takes me about an hour and a half if I work quickly and efficiently. So happy I bought this! Will be using on my legs in the summer.</li>
    <li> the package came after 2 days thanks to amazon prime! I received this product today and everything looks perfectly fine except when I opened the package with all the products inside, there was a post epilation lotion and post wax cooling gel. In the product description, it says that this product should come with pre epilation oil not the post epilation lotion. I think its important to have the pre epilation oil so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin. it took me an hour to finish waxing and I was in a  LOT  of pain doing it. The products works well. The only thing that you have to remember is not to put too much or too little wax. When you put too much it sticks so well in your hair and make it harder to pull. So i kinda of hesitate to pull my hairs and that made it so difficult to get the wax off since it already sticked into my skin so hard. What i did is to cut those wax full of hairs using a small nose scissors and it worked just fine. Also you have to keep the heater to medium to keep the wax in good temperature which I found working its best when its in medium temp. When you apply the wax, follow the direction of your hair line. DO NOT apply the wax on the opposite direction as it will be very messy when it dries, making it hard to pull the corner of the wax. However, when you pull, pull from the opposite  direction of how your hair grows because when you don&#x27;t, you will lose skin and bleed. Waxing yourself is definitely not an easy task, as its messy, it hurts your neck and it takes guts to take the pain. do not hesitate when pulling, pull quickly and hard! For the excess hairs, its helpful to plaque it out using tweezers. For excess wax, its really easy to clean it up specially if you used a baby oil. after putting the baby oil and cleaning the wax residue,clean the surface area with dry cloth to get the excess oil then apply the post cooling gel which helps a lot. When you find your area in pain, slap the painful area and pain will disappear. After doing all this,I must say that all the hard work paid it off. My skin is smooth as baby&#x27;s skin no hairs and no bumps. This product works, you just need to learn to use a proper techniques and of course a lot of patience or else just go to salon and have a professional do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Worked great and the instructional vid with tips was very helpful.</li>
    <li> I recommend  using with your spouse if your jittery about yanking the wax off. I really like this product. I plan to continue purchasing and using this Gigi wax. Easy to use!</li>
    <li> This whole pack is perfect! Also a great kit for personal use, especially for those like myself that are first timers in giving themselves any kind of wax. The wax is very good quality as well.</li>
    <li> Needs pratice to do it on ur own.. But its still serve its purpose...</li>
    <li> I bought this as a last resort tactic for waxing. I have very coarse body hair and most wax kits that I would buy at drug stores would more pain than hair removal. So when i heard about this hard wax that didn&#x27;t even require strips I all for it. I bought it, followed the instructions and proceeded to wax. Never in my history of waxing have i ever had such and easy time waxing. The removal of the hair was painful but not extremely gut wretchedly painful as I have experienced with past waxes. I could say the the pain is tolerable.  This kit comes with everything that you need, and the wax does what it says it does. It sticks to the hair and not to your skin perfect. So you can use this wax anywhere on your skin. Plus you save money doing at home waxing!</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a reasonably priced at home wax warmer and this kit fit all my needs.  Consistent with other reviews, the lid to my warmer arrived broken due to poor packaging.  I decided just to live with the defect since it is cosmetic and not functional, but if you care how it looks - this product may not be for you.  The warmer and wax worked wonderfully as did the other products, but I would not purchase the pre-epilation oil or post wax cooling gel again.  They worked really well, but the oil is just a dry mineral oil like Johnsons Baby Oil and the Gel is just mentholated Aloe both of which can be purchased in jumbo sizes at your nearest Wal-Mart for dollars.  All in all, I would recommend this product and plan to purchase more of the wax in the near future.</li>
    <li> doesnt work well tweezing is faster...worst product I have ever seen..</li>
    <li> I have tried a few waxing kits and this is the only one I would recommend and that I will use! It doesn&#x27;t have that awful burning smell and it&#x27;s so much easier than trying to keep it warm from the microwave. This is the real deal, keeps it at a perfect temperature so you can get this painful process done as quick as possible. No need to waste money at salons anymore. Great for beginners, just know you might have to have the patience to learn the process (don&#x27;t worry, it comes with detailed instructions on dvd). I have seen salons use this same kit and charge $70. I would recommend using a cheap mirror and using in a well lit room to keep things cleaner. Set your &#x27;station&#x27; up somewhere comfortable. I set out towels and paper towels, bring your phone since the last thing you want is to hobble into a different room and get a sticky waxy mess everywhere. Only use the wood sticks once since you don&#x27;t want to contaminate your entire tub of wax with a stray hair. More sanitary the better! I didn&#x27;t get any bruising as it seems that the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin like I have seen other brands do. I also love the collar it comes with to put around the top of the wax to keep it from getting all over the warmer and burning. This product looks very nice set up in my bathroom that I don&#x27;t mind leaving it out on a shelf. It arrived quickly and well packaged. 2 thumbs up GiGi!</li>
    <li> Wax heater, sticks , oil and gel were usefull but not the hot wax provided with Kit. Soon after i applied it will get dried off and stick to my skin . I will have to apply another layer of wax to remove using strips soon after moment i apply wax. Somehow it was messy for me on first day. Any suggestions from some one who is already using it successfully? Can i return this product?</li>
    <li> Still works like new after three years and used all of the 14 ounces of wax.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing (brows and bikini area) at home for a few years after paying over $100 to have it done professionally, then having a bad experience when I tried to go cheaper.  I knew after seeing the expensive salon do it I could do a better job than the cheap one.  I have been using a Sally Hansen warmer I found at Walgreens, but the small wax tins run out pretty quickly and didn&#x27;t really seem to work as well after they had been heated once.  I have used the Gigi a couple times now and it works really good.  If you have the pain tolerance required to wax at home (or at all) I would really recommend this product.  I have gotten great results and still have tons of wax left (and it reheats well).</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. There are some negative reviews of this product, but the individuals do not have any professional training on waxing. As for help and you will love this wax pot. Now Im all ready for the pool and ocean.</li>
    <li> The wax is not really that good at all ... And so sticky , I got bruised and the wax also got stuck on my bathtub for days , buy a cheaper wax at ur grocery store and it will probably do a better job</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Loved the video, though it was a bit weird to watch. This kit is definitely geared to the salon professional, but the instructions were easy to understand and I could actually do it myself, never having had a Brazilian wax in a salon or spa before I got this kit. Recommend for someone who wants a professional quality product that can be used in the modesty and privacy of home. I will say that having a glass of wine or a nice stiff drink does make the process a bit less uncomfortable, and is also highly recommended :-)</li>
    <li> I may have a high tolerance for waxing pain but I was shocked after reading so many reviews how easy and pain free this kit was. I did a full Brazilian, legs, under arms and eye brows with out help. It did hurt more in the areas where it was difficult to pull my skin tight on my own but nothing I could not handle. I used corn starch (as I read in a review) on my legs as a pre base and it worked great. I watched a few youtube videos and took notes from several reviews so educate yourself before you start it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take longer than 30 minutes to melt and shipping was a few days passed the estimated date.  I probably saved $100 plus on my first use from what I would have paid in a salon.</li>
    <li> I was thinking it was user error, but I have come to the conclusion it&#x27;s a terrible WAX!! Wax was everywhere. I used this a week ago and I&#x27;m still finding wax on my floor. Two days after using it I was finding wax on my skin...taking a hot shower doesn&#x27;t help! It was in my nails on parts that I didn&#x27;t even wax. Not impressed!!! I&#x27;ll be going back to the professionals!</li>
    <li> This items came as advertise with a small leakage.  After advising of the problem I was immediately accommodated for the inconvenience.  I will  definitely recommend this product to all my friends and family members.  The price was great the the service was outstanding.</li>
    <li> Hard wax is different than soft wax.  It&#x27;s also easier and better in many ways.  I used this kit for waxing my legs and it worked superbly.</li>
    <li> Giving 4 stars because when it arrived the oil it came with was spilled all over inside the box. Other than that, met expectations.</li>
    <li> This does not use strips. You let the wax dry and then just pull the wax off with your hand. I tried waxing with strips before and that is much less painful for what I was doing, which was bikini waxing. I couldn&#x27;t even finish waxing with this. I liked the fact that it came with a warmer but it took forever to warm up. This may be a great product for a professional, I&#x27;m not really sure, but for someone like me who is doing this at home I think waxing with the strips is much better.</li>
    <li> The BrazilianHardWax is easy to work with, especially on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I REALLY want to love this product. In fact, I would go so far as to say it is better than any other Brazilian-waxing kit you can get from your brick and mortar grocery store. I have tried many other products before, and while it does better than the others I have tried, I will say this: if you are looking for a full-body waxing kit, this product will not do. (I&#x27;ll get back to this in a minute.) While I do not claim to be a professional aesthetician, I do find that despite people&#x27;s insistence that hard wax is the best for waxing (and maybe it is), it does leave me wanting. (And I do recommend you have someone else do the waxing for you, it is SOOO much easier for them to reach places for you; it&#x27;s a fact.) I have used this product about 5 times now and while I am getting better at using it now, but even still, I can&#x27;t help but think: Is there no wax that can harden up and peel better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a busy person with not much time on your hands, this is not for you. It also takes a REALLY long time to remove all of the hair you want gone... even small areas of skin take longer than you would think. This isn&#x27;t the kind of product that you can use every morning before going in to work. I find it more timely to just shave the hair off. I had to wax in small time increments over several days just to get all the hair I wanted off. I would use this maybe every weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does the product work? It does, but in my experience it shouldn&#x27;t be used for anything other than your groin/bikini line. I don&#x27;t know if my hair is sturdier than others&#x27;, but I have tried waxing my armpits, chest, nipples, and around the bellybutton but it only got about half the hairs. The way I see it, this product is good for what it was intended to be used for: Brazilian waxes and nothing more. It&#x27;s not really a full-body wax kit even though some people think it is. I have tried the &amp;#34;pull in the direction opposite that the hairs are growing&amp;#34; technique and it worked some ofthe time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give you guys updates if I think the product is really better than I think it is at the present. Until then, keep it kind-of-ouchy. ^_^</li>
    <li> I have gotten waxed a few times at a salon, and when I saw the price on this, for less than half the cost of a salon visit, I decided that it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how much I love it! It was so easy to use, and so much less painful than the soft wax I&#x27;ve used. The only issue I had was that at first I made the strips way too thick because of the instructions to make sure it didn&#x27;t get brittle. After a few strips I got the hang of it though.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have the problem of making too much of a mess, I just twirled the stick until it stopped dripping before applying it. The oil is a must! It made it so much less painful. And this was so much less painful than other waxes that I&#x27;ve gotten.&lt;br /&gt;Almost all the hair came out on the first pull (there&#x27;s always those few that grow in a weird direction and have to be plucked) and the hair didn&#x27;t even have to be too long before I was able to get the wax to work.&lt;br /&gt;I probably will NOT be using this on my eyebrows, simply because I&#x27;m not a professional and am terrified of messing my brows up. However, if you&#x27;re comfortable trying, I would say go for it, I see no reason not to.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much, I already bought another can of wax, just in case I run out when I need it. But I have a feeling that this will be able to last a very long time - each wax took much less than I had expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying more sticks with the kit, because it comes with very few. And you&#x27;ll definitely need more collars, they are only cardboard and will break down quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely say, if you enjoy the results of waxing but can&#x27;t afford it often this is a must-have.</li>
    <li> affordable price, but works great as it should. It takes some times to get familiar with the wax, after that the results are great.</li>
    <li> Wax comes off easy. I can control the temp. easiest way to wax. waxing hurts so bad tho haha I RECOMMEND THE PRE GEL</li>
    <li> Great starter kit for at home waxing. Much cheaper and easier than going and getting it done at a salon.</li>
    <li> Great kit, not the highest quality warmer, does its job totally fine. My wife really like it.  Good value for its price</li>
    <li> I love it. It´s small, and easy to carry.</li>
    <li> Great wax, much better than the Sally Hansen microwavable wax  I tried using multiple times. Now if I could only get the courage to go through with it!</li>
    <li> Great kits and it last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, and on under arms, it&#x27;s a bit messy to do yourself, but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll never spend $80-$100 at a salon again. Takes ALL the hair.  Doesn&#x27;t leave any behind.  A bit painful, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST body wax ever!  I have tried several store bought waxes before to no avail.  Not one of them worked and I had to resort to shaving once again every time I tried to use one of those products.  Not long ago, I was actually considering to try professional waxing, but I was hesitant because I&#x27;ve heard it can take a toll on your wallet.  However before taking that step I decided to search for a wax similar to the one I use on my facial hair (Sally Hansen&#x27;s microwaveable facial hair removing wax) which up to that point had been the only wax product ever to work on me, at all.  Well, I finally stumbled upon this brand and liked it, although is not microwaveable, it  is a hard wax that can be removed by hand without having to use those annoying strips.  After reading the reviews I decided to buy the kit.  The kit never arrived to my home although Amazon&#x27;s order tracker said it did.  I contacted the seller whom assured me it had been delivered; I insisted that the package was never delivered to my house, after  two email exchanges the seller shipped me another kit, which this time made it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Like many here have said  before, apply a moisturizing oil before using the wax. Use the one that comes with the kit.  If you do not have this, coconut oil, baby oil or mineral oil will do just fine. The point is to use the oil, without it  you will probably have a very painful experience. With it you get a mild  manageable pain/discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After you are done, apply a lotion something soothing  for you will most likely experience slight redness.  The redness will go away in a couple of hours, the important thing is to keep the skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It is possible to wax large areas with this.  In fact I used it on both legs the first time, it took me about an hour and 15 minutes to do both legs.  I imagine next time will take less, just need patience that is all.</li>
    <li> Came broken 😔 I was bummed!</li>
    <li> This kit will most definitely sound like a great idea, especially after you calculate how much you pay for one of these procedures every 3-5 weeks. Let&#x27;s keep it real, it hurts to get your pubes waxed. There is nothing you can do to avoid it. It takes practice and bravery to accomplish such a procedure solo. The wax WILL get everywhere. You WILL shed a tear. You WILL save alot of money. practice makes perfect. I suggest starting with the simple bikini wax, then see how you feel. The price of this wax kit is just fantastic. You can use other same size canned wax in it. It&#x27;s just a great buy even if you only use it for underarm waxing, its a steal.</li>
    <li> Awesome, glad I got this</li>
    <li> I liked it and I will probably use this and other forms, but Brazilian is for the body not just the face. It was difficult using it and unless you properly sanitize and cool your face you will probably develop little bumps. YIKES!</li>
    <li> I mainly bought this kit for the included warmer due to the fact that i was living with 3 guys at the time and going to microwave to heat up wax wouldve just been far too humiliating!. The warmer works as anyone would want it to, although it does take a while to heat up. the instructional dvd is very odd and unhelpful. basically just a pornographic advertisement for this wax brand and does not really provide many tips on how to give a bikini wax</li>
    <li> The lid was broken when I received it, but I was unable to return or exchange it. Amazon alerts you that it cannot be returned because it contains &amp;#34;hazardous materials&amp;#34;. There should be a warning when you purchase the item that you will not be able to return it.</li>
    <li> Putting hot wax on your lady bits is not going to be fun. But if it keeps me from having to shave all of the time, its worth it! I&#x27;ll share with you all some lessons I learned the hard (and painful) way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the oil. Seriously, just do it. I tried without and it has to be similar to giving childbirth without an epidural. Spread some oil on the area youre waxing, wipe with a towel, and then slap on some baby powder. You don&#x27;t want wax stuck to your skin AND your hair. Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a hard wax so you don&#x27;t need to use strips to remove the wax, but its worth the $6 to buy some and make your life easier. It speeds up the waxing and saves you from trying to pull up the wax from your skin and wait for the exact dryness. Put on the wax, press a strip over top and wait maybe 5 seconds and pull. Wayyy more efficient than 30 seconds for the wax to dry fully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy some wax remover! No matter how great your technique, there will be a little left over driving you nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will save some hassle. Overall I am absolutely thrilled with this purchase. A great value and a great product that I plan to use for many years! My skin is smooth and not itchy from stubble- I will gladly go through the waxing once a month for these results!</li>
    <li> The wax itself is very efficient and does remove coarse hair, perfect for the area. I had no problem with the wax warmer either. The reason I am giving it four stars however, is because of my problems with the wax applicator sticks and the CD included with the kit. First, the sticks are slanted at both sides (not sure why) which makes it really difficult to apply the wax in this area. When applying wax, you have to apply a generous amount to the direction of hair growth, managing to create a little &amp;#34;tab&amp;#34; at the end to pull the wax off. I found that with the slanted applicator sticks, it was hard to make this &amp;#34;tab&amp;#34;. This leads me to the instructional CD included. The CD does make some helpful remarks, however, one thing I strongly suggest they include is the correct motion to apply the wax generously and create the &amp;#34;tab&amp;#34; at the end. I had to go to youtube to watch some tutorials, which by the way, all used the rounded wax applicator sticks (the ones that look just like popsicle sticks), to understand how to do it correctly. I think with rounded applicator sticks and practice, lots of practice, I won&#x27;t have trouble doing my own waxing. Overall these are my only 2 complaints with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to a salon professional to correct my half- done wax job, but I&#x27;m certainly not done with this waxing kit. After buying new wax applicator sticks I&#x27;ll give it another shot.</li>
    <li> Does the job but the wax itself irritates everybody&#x27;s skin. Took weeks for the breakouts to heal and by that point it was redundant.</li>
    <li> The instructions are easy to follow and I used this for my underarms.  It works well but I tried it on my nether regions and it was PAIN PAIN PAIN.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone who is new to waxing should be waxing at home. Go get it done a few times to observe proper technique and learn what consistency the wax should. After the first time it will hurt a heck of a lot less when you go to do it yourself because it genuinely does get easier if you maintain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this wax better than cream wax and preloaded hard wax strips for underarm and bikini waxing. It does a great job, pain is minimal, easy to get precisely where you want it and its not messy to clean up. USE THE OIL, you can use regular baby oil too but it makes all of the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For legs, this works fine but it is very time consuming. For me, I find preloaded cold wax strips like completely bare hypo-allergenic strips work well, goes quickly and minimizes discomfort. I hate with a passion cream wax b/c it is so messy and I always run out of strips. In my opinion is also hurts more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this kit was exactly as promised and this is the best stuff around for a great bikini and underarm wax I have found.</li>
    <li> Much easier using hard wax than soft wax with strips.  But really messy.  The unit is too heavy to hold while applying wax so it drips enroute from applicator to area being treated.  Maybe I will become more proficient with time.</li>
    <li> This is Bill&#x27;s wife, so written by a woman:) This kit is a steal. Hurts way way less than salon waxing, in privacy at home, for far less than one salon visit. And, I&#x27;ve got tons of wax left. Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;And the person who figured out that pressing a piece of dried wax into new wax and using it as a tag to pull with? Freaking genius! Thank you! Made all the difference for me.</li>
    <li> Using this wax has been terribly painful every time I use it, but I keep using it because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my hair from growing back for approximately 2 weeks. It takes me about 2 hours to wax everything, including the brazilian waxing and underarms. You have to grow your hair out for at least a couple of weeks before using this product so that your hair is long enough to pull off with the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: The wax sticks to everything.  Despite that I have an enormous tarp covering all of my floor counter and everything else, this stuff still gets everywhere, including all over the wax warmer. It is very difficult to get off the skin, so I highly recommend wearing gloves. I tried to use baby oil to get any excess oil off after the whole process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of the pain, you will still probably spend time plucking stray hairs, and another 25 minutes cleaning up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7/2016 After becoming fed up with the pain of waxing (I used the Gigi kit many times), I finally found a Groupon for laser hair removal treatments and it is so much better. Everyone is different but laser treatments can permanently remove your hair in about 12 sessions. I have so far done my under arms and Brazilian area, and it is definitely worth the money.the pre-epilating oil. Also TONS OF STRAY HAIRS REMAINED that I had to manually pluck out. Just to do my underarms took almost an hour. It was exhausting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WAX gets EVERYWHERE. Once you try to get it off one finger with another finger, not only does it not fully come off, but it just sticks to the new finger. Despite that I had an enormous sized tarp covering all of my floor counter and everything else, this stuff got everywhere, including all over my brand new wax warmer. The wax warmer is now covered in wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later when I got enough energy to attempt a full wax of the pubic area (sphynx), I tried again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS WAS THE MOST PAINFUL THING I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have ever seen the 40 year old virgin movie where he has huge patches of chest hair removed and is screaming in pain - that does not even do the pain I felt justice. I could not stop saying &amp;#34;oh my - , oh my - &amp;#34; I was having to yell something just to get through one pull of the wax. The wax itself, although on the lowest temperature was burning my pubic area. IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I went through with it, and still had TONS OF STRAY HAIRS REMAINING AFTER 2 HOURS and a TON of WAX USED. I ended up spending an additional 20 minutes plucking stray hairs, and another 25 minutes cleaning myself up and then cleaning the surrounding area. My fiance and I both still had wax on our feet somehow and had to use an applicator just to try to scrape it off.  The wax got on the floor, the counter and in my bathtub from washing off - it stuck to the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really disappointed in this system, but now I know I will be trying the sugaring method today which is supposed to be much less painful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I expected</li>
    <li> Other than my eyebrows, once, I have never had a used wax for hair removal.  I am one of those people that like to do things on my own rather than paying outrageous prices at salons.  I was nervous about the pain involved in waxing, but I decided it would be worth a try especially at this price.  I didn&#x27;t think the wax was too hot, like some of the reviews said, and once I got the hang of pulling it off very quickly it was bearable for the great results in the bikini area.  The other day I heated it up and used it on my chin hair which was also a great success.  It was very easy to clean up and the amount of was used was minimal.  Great product, even if you have no experience at all with waxing!!</li>
    <li> This was absolutely yhe worst WAX ever fpr large areas or your &amp;#34;Brazilian&amp;#34;. Stupid no needing strips but its more painful because u peel it off. Its like slowly plucking..&lt;br /&gt;The warmer is fantastic and the before n after gela are great. Just buy a different wax its self. The Azulene is blue ans work perfect n no burning</li>
    <li> It works. The downside is its messy and the wax feels more like actual wax than something that is used for hair removal. I purchased the kit for the warmer. It was a few bucks more as opposed to getting the warmer a la carte. Dissapointed, no. Excited, not exactly. but did it get the job done, yes! Most importantly I saved a ton by doing it myself</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the main purpose of waxing my legs.  Felt I gave it the college try but never quite got it.  It was very difficult reaching the correct consistency and impossible reaching all areas.  When I tried to return it, I didn&#x27;t realize because it is considered hazardous material it had a no return policy.  Maybe I can find someone who can put it to good use.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!!!  Used many diy waxing kits at home.  By far the best results and less pain.  A little sticky.  Make sure to use the oil before applying the wax or the wax will stick to your skin.  Apply some to your fingers before handling as well so it doesn&#x27;t stick all over your fingers.  The brown lid cracked out of nowhere though but can still use.</li>
    <li> im glad is pent the money on this just to learn its not a wonder product, this is great to get started. I would recommend using a more professional type of product rather than this. this wax seems to make me grow more hair...yes. I think it has to do with the wax. I will use a honey wax that they use in the salon. this product was made to be convenient. sometimes it better to just do it how your supposed to do it instead of being &amp;#34;convenient&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;its not that great to use... it COOL to use but not great. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to my daughter but I would recommend it it to a frienemie</li>
    <li> I have tried it a few times since I purchased, I guess its good for the price. My only complaint would be about the wax always leaving little bits behind and having to go back with tweezers.</li>
    <li> Amazing set for a reasonable price. You literally get everything you need to wax a person. My set came as shown. No damage as others had stated (I was worried). Warmer takes about 30-40 mins and that is normal for the amount of wax the warmer has to heat up. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot either. Wax feels so good on skin. I haven&#x27;t broke out from using the wax on my face. Do make sure to get a good even layer of wax to the intended area or you might have a crusty messy wax problem on your skin. And it&#x27;s kind of difficult to remove if that happens. It just takes some practice I guess. Amazing wax... Gets every hair!</li>
    <li> Came with everything you need as a beginner. Plenty of wax, oil, sticks and aloe lotion to last a good while. The instructional DVD is 15 mins and is a little obnoxious and awkward, not the most helpful, but there is always youtube anyway. The unit itself is a little bigger than I hoped it would be, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal. Simple to use, I got the hang of it quickly. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many waxes in my life and FINALLY decided that I was tired of spending a ton of money on it and that I could do this myself. The eyebrow wax, for me, had a learning curve b/c I was scared I was going to take all my eyebrows off. That said, after a couple of tries, I got it (brows in tact!!). My bikini area was actually a breeze. Yes, it still hurt, but I&#x27;ve been waxed a lot, I&#x27;ve tried an epilator (never again!!), and I&#x27;ve shaved. THIS is the only way for me now. No ugly shaving bumps this way! I actually prefer to do it myself and honestly, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as badly as when someone else does it! Watch the DVD if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, well even if you do, it&#x27;s best to refresh. My pointers (which are similar to the others but I find the more I read similar reviews, the more likely it is for me to actually take the tips and make my decision):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Keep it on high for 15-20 min then turn it down to low (I left it on high accidentally for about an hour then had to turn it off for 20 min to get it to the thickness I wanted. (THIN AND DRIPPY IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT)&lt;br /&gt;2. Hence this tip- keep it thick.&lt;br /&gt;3. Take a couple of Ibuprofen 30 minutes prior to bikini or underarm wax (eyebrow waxing doesn&#x27;t hurt me at all so I don&#x27;t take any if I&#x27;m just doing brows).&lt;br /&gt;4. Make absolute sure to use the pre-oil and don&#x27;t worry about using too much.&lt;br /&gt;5. Extend the waxing area an inch or so each time to be able to lift the corner of the wax up to rip off. You can start lifting the corner as soon as you cover the area you want, just wait to rip until it&#x27;s not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;6. Also, the clean collars are great to keep the top of the warmer area clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase, easy, mess-free. Maybe I missed my calling as an esthetician.</li>
    <li> This is the very first home waxing kit I have ever used. I like that they offer an instructional video, that was helpful since I had no experience at the time. I especially like that the warmer is of generic size so I can use other brands of wax and am not limited to their product. The wax itself works great and is fairly painless on the face. But I have found that if I don&#x27;t apply it thick enough it breaks off while ripping. I have ordered a more expensive brand of wax to try as a comparison.</li>
    <li> Awesome...I love this. I wish I would have bought this years ago. So easy and pays for itself on the second use.</li>
    <li> Its very good product. Very easy to use, and the gels helped a lot to calm down the pain. Perfect</li>
    <li> I was paying to get waxed (Brazilian), which is much quicker I will just say ahead of time. But it got old, (mainly the price) so I tried this out. It takes a little time to get used to having to wax yourself, but with practice and patience it is possible. The money I spent on this unit, paid for itself with one use. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The wax takes forever to melt. There&#x27;s no waxing strips. And Its messy. It arrived on time though. It gets the job done but takes a little longer.</li>
    <li> Works great. Cooling gel and the pre epilation oil are very useful</li>
    <li> Purchased for home use since I was spending so much on the small kits that didn&#x27;t really work after re-heated more than once. Have used it once so far and like it, does take awhile to heat up though. Wax is good, came off easily without leaving much residue. Wished it came with a couple of the paper rings but will order when I need to refill wax.</li>
    <li> I have not tried the waxing kit as of this writing. However if you are impatient and want things quickly I can say ordering and receiving the product was flawless. The package was sent quickly as stated. Product is good in the directions for use.</li>
    <li> I love my Gigi kit! If you&#x27;re new to waxing those areas that hurt like beep then this is perfect for you! It comes with the oil and cooling gel and plenty of sticks.</li>
    <li> This is very good and safe to use. I am so happy I found this product because I no longer have to pay all that money now to get my waxing done. I may even buy my girlfriend this kit for her Bday!! The price was a great price as well.</li>
    <li> I have never had anything waxed, let alone wax anything myself so I am a complete beginner to the process. I bought this item because I was tired of how often I have to shave my underarms and legs and then one day later the areas look dark and feel prickly (I have black hair). So enticed by the promise of smooth feeling skin for days I decided to give it a try, it seemed to me a good price. Being  newbie I started by attempting my underarms. I had looked through the reviews and decided that I would use this with muslin strips as that seemed to really ease the removal and speed things up. I plugged in the heater and put the wax in and my only slight complaint was that it took a LONG time to fully melt (~ 1 hr at least). I imagine this is because the wax container was filled to the top and that it is actually a lot of wax to melt. But, once the wax was ready to go, it was smooth sailing (no pun intended). I turned the wax warmer to medium, used the pre-epilation oil and then dusted with baby powder as a waxing prep. The first underarm took me maybe half an hour but by the time I did my second under arm I had a whole system down and I was done in five minutes. I applied wax starting at the top of my underarm in about 1 inch strips, I had a number of muslin strips set out ahead of time and proceeded to wax in consecutive 1 inch strips. Done in no time! There were a couple of loose hairs that I plucked but was super impressed by how effective the wax was in conjunction with use of the muslin strips. The pain was mild but I have a high tolerance for pain. After 15 minutes, my underarms felt totally back to normal and were smoother than I&#x27;ve ever seen! Would highly recommend this product for someone that things they can take some brief pain for the benefit of smooth, smooth hairless skin. It is now 3 days later and I can&#x27;t believe how great my underarms still look and feel. I will definitely be wearing more sleeveless tops this summer!</li>
    <li> This kit is great! I was expecting to get an opened bottle of oil and a cracked cover but everything was intact and in perfect quality. This kind of wax (hard wax) works so well for brazillian waxing!!! It&#x27;s so much less of a hassle not having to worry about the strips. And the wax definately doesn&#x27;t stick to skin, just hair so it&#x27;s much less painful. I greatly recommend this product! I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if other brands are better. But this brazilian hard wax is by far the worst of all hair removal option I tried. I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. 1st, it took forever to get warmed up. It&#x27;s definitely not 20 mins like they said on the demo video. Then, you&#x27;d deal with a huge mess. I&#x27;m a very neat person and I tried what I could to not make any drizzle. But it&#x27;s simply impossible. The wax goes everywhere. On the sink, on the heating device itself, on the floor, on the area of your skin and hair even if you don&#x27;t want it to be. Once it&#x27;s stuck to your hair, it&#x27;s impossible to get it off. It can&#x27;t be washed off by water and soap. So if its gets to the part of the hair you didn&#x27;t want to remove, all you can do is to cut the hair. What&#x27;s more is the little bits of wax got left on your skin also can&#x27;t be washed off. Now after a wax job and a shower, my skin looks like it&#x27;s been sunburned because of the bits and pieces of wax got left behind. The heating device also overheats the wax, with time, you feel the wax burns your skin. And not to mention a hair removal job usually takes me half an hour. This time, it took more than two hours and the result is not even nearly as good. I&#x27;m definitely going to back to my old technique.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good but painful as heck!</li>
    <li> Great product, give it a 4 only because the lid was broken during shipping</li>
    <li> Fabulous! Smells great, works well. Took off too much brow, great on legs! Brazillion, you dont want to hear about it!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  I am not a waxing pro, so I did not realize until I receive this kit, that this was not only hard wax and for brazilians, not brows, but did not come with muslin.  Now that I have done my research on hard and soft wax, I know why it did not come with muslin.  HOWEVER, I still used this on my brows and mini stache (lol) and loved it.  It took about an hour to melt completely for thie first time.  After melting, I applied the wax using the appropriate wood applicator, let it sit for a second (but not get completely hard), still applied a muslin strip, smooth, and then once hard pulled the strip.  PRESTO, not only was the removal clean, but it also did not hurt as much as when the salon do it.  I didn&#x27;t use the prewax oil.  I did use the after-waxing product to make sure the areas did not swell up or become iritated.  One day when I am brave enough, I will try to give myself a brazlian.  I do plan on doing small patches in my bikini area as a tester.  **please note that I started out with clean, dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am truly satified and will be waxing my brows about once a month.</li>
    <li> This wax kit was the best investment I have ever made!! I have used the GiGi hard and soft wax with this heater. The other day I heated up a Satin Smooth Wax and it works for that tin container as well. They are both the same size.</li>
    <li> Works very well  but it does cause some pain but buy some numbing spray or creme</li>
    <li> I was shocked as to little this hurt. I had previously bought a hard wax kit that you need to microwave and what a pain! This is so much faster, so much cleaner, and so much easier! I showered and exfoliated before starting the process. It took me less than an hour (last kit it took me 2+ hours!). As I ripped some strips off I kept thinking &amp;#34;either my pain receptors aren&#x27;t working or this product is just that good!&amp;#34; I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have never had my bikini waxed ever, I&#x27;ve always shaved that area. For this price I thought I would give it a try. I have waxed my bikini area 3 times now and it gets easier every time. My best advice would be to give yourself plenty of time the first couple times you wax. Your skin will be red and puffy for a couple of hours but it does go away. The last time I waxed it definitely went a lot quicker and was less painful. This waxing system is way better than shaving.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t get all the hair. I have to do it 2 or 3 times in the same spot and sometimes there is still a few hairs left.</li>
    <li> Saved tons of money using this. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this purchase.  I&#x27;ve never waxed before and really just wanted to try it out.  This kit comes with a instructional cd (it&#x27;s a 10 min long video, and pretty helpful), pre epilation oil, post-waxing gel, application sticks, the wax, and the wax heater. One thing that I noticed is that it took maybe 50 mins of heating for the wax to be usable, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is just because it was the first heating.  I bled a little bit in &amp;#34;that area&amp;#34; when I tried it for the first time, but wasn&#x27;t too worried because my skin is pretty sensitive.  I saw that there are a lot of negative reviews about the wax being to messy or sticky...  But it&#x27;s wax...  With more practice I&#x27;m confident you&#x27;ll get better at your technique and have cleaner results.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve had before wax kit but this one is different, its easy to use and even my husband liked it.:):)</li>
    <li> This has everything you need to get started. There is even a how-to video, which is quite helpful. This is a hard wax kit, which I much prefer over the soft wax that requires the strips.</li>
    <li> The product worked exactly as I expected and the shipping was very fast. It&#x27;s an amazing value for the price and I&#x27;d highly recommended it!</li>
    <li> Very poor. Did not work for me with terrible pain!!!</li>
    <li> I have zero training around waxing. This comes with a video that walks you through what to do. I did receive the product and it was broken but with a quick phone call the company had a new one on it&#x27;s way. I was VERY pleased with the transaction and how quickly they resolved the issue. The product itself is great! You can wax more than just bikini with the hard wax. Love Love Love it!</li>
    <li> Only 3 stars due to lack of product that said would be with the kit and was not. Otherwise I would buy again. (No DVD came with my kit)</li>
    <li> Before buying this I had only ever gone into a salon to get waxed. I bought this because financially it wasn&#x27;t within my budget to shell out $60 a month for a Brazilian. It comes with just about everything you need (I also ordered the Gigi Clean Collars to help keep wax off the wax warmer, and Gigi Wax Off to help remove wax after). The instructional video helps, but be warned it&#x27;s definitely NSFW and should probably be watched in private. I prefer hard wax like this over wax strips, it&#x27;s easier to remove and doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin. I bought this from Amazon for about $30. I saw this same kit at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for $85. Needless to say, I&#x27;m super happy I found it for such a great price. I&#x27;ve used this about 4 times now and I&#x27;ve still got plenty of wax, and about half the amount of (large) sticks that came with it. Not bad if you ask me. I&#x27;ll be able to use this at least 4 more times before I need to buy any replacement supplies. That&#x27;s at least 8 Brazilian waxes, which would have cost me $480 total in salons, for only $30. F*** yeah!&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time ever waxing on your own, here&#x27;s a few tips: Give yourself ample time; it is NOT easy to rip wax off a sensitive area on your own. I usually take about 45-1hr because I let myself relax for a bit after removing each piece of wax, and sometimes I need to give myself extra time to breathe before pulling. Make sure you&#x27;re somewhere you can fully lay down. It helps. Be sure to lay something down under you and around the warmer to prevent getting wax on any surface. I prefer to use a paper bag that&#x27;s been cut to lay flat because 1. I have a ton of those around the apt so it doesn&#x27;t cost me anything, 2. it protects the area from getting wax on it, and 3. I can easily throw it away when I&#x27;m done. Buena suerte!</li>
    <li> i tried to do a home waxing for myself and honestly this kind of wax its not good for beginners like me maybe should try satin smooth brand for waxing. the warmer its ok</li>
    <li> Looooooove it, I was tired of paying 20 box to get mediocre underarm waxing plus tip that I felt obligated to give even though I was NEVER satisfied with the waxing and I contemplated for a long time before buying this but I am glad I did. It is awesome and for now still working.  I am hoping it lasts for a very long time</li>
    <li> It does take practice to get used to the waxing process but if you follow the instructions and take your time it does work. Still awkward to reach certain areas on your own though...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to have a waxing kit at home. That being said........&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Convenient, comes with a good amount of wax, and smells pleasant&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Wax doesn&#x27;t take off all the the hairs, doesn&#x27;t warm up fast at all, and doesn&#x27;t come with enough sticks :/</li>
    <li> The Gigi waxing kit arrived on time and was advertised accurately. I find it to be very easy to use. The dvd included was very informative.</li>
    <li> We love our waxing kit! I&#x27;ve been using this on my legs as I have very sensitive legs and they get red dots all over them any time I shave (been to multiple dermatologists and NO ONE can figure it out...been on creams, everything). The wax doesn&#x27;t get too hot, and is in a nice quality warmer. I only wish it came with stuff to clean the excess wax off that&#x27;s left on your body :/</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews I was a little nervous on buying this kit. I watched a couple YouTube videos on how to use hard wax and it looked simple!  The night I got it I waxed my mom&#x27;s lip and my lip and my eyebrows. SO EASY! Not very messy and it heated up QUICK!!  2 days after I waxed my lip I broke out into a rash.. so I will be buying the facial wax next! But overall I would absolutely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never waxed myself or gotten wax ever in my life, so I&#x27;m definitely a beginner and don&#x27;t know what to expect. The disc is very helpful with all instruction and techniques, so I highly recommend watching the video carefully before you start using the wax. It does hurt like many people say about waxing in general, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad if you can peel the wax off fast. The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is that the pre epilation oil doesn&#x27;t really do anything, kind of useless, or even made it worse that the wax is easily slipped off from my hand when I tried to peel it off. The cooling gel doesn&#x27;t do much either, but it won&#x27;t hurt to apply to your skin after waxing. Other than that, this is a good product; I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is all you need if you&#x27;re planning to start doing your own bikini waxes. The kit is great and is very easy to use. It does take a bit of practice to get a good result, but it can be done. You just need to clear your schedule and take it slow. I love the wax and how gentle it is on my skin. I didn&#x27;t really have any redness nor was it painful. I&#x27;ve tried it out once already and I was very pleased with the result. It was no different from what I used to get from my salon. If you can do it better or the same as your beautician why go somewhere else, just get this kit and do it at home. This will save you tons of money! Overall, great product and I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of doing the procedure in the comfort of their own home.</li>
    <li> I love this waxing kit.. it is amazing!!!! It gives you a clean and smooth look..The dvd is also very helpful..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for the price. The package arrived late. I am glad I didn&#x27;t order it as a gift. Didn&#x27;t really like how the wax stuck to my skin. If you use this, make sure to be quick or else your going to have wax stuck your skin. Other then that it works pretty good for small areas.</li>
    <li> I have received and used the waxing kit this past Monday. First time user of waxing and I used it for my underarms. I followed the instructions for heating the wax and watched the DVD that came with the kit for learning how to apply the wax (though it was for a Brazillian bakini wax). I did have the help of my husband which was a plus. It was simple to apply and may have taken a few minutes for the wax to harden enough to strip the hair out. My tolerance of pain is fairly high, so it didn&#x27;t bother me too much and I didn&#x27;t take any Motrin or Tylenol beforehand. Overall, I am very pleased with the product and my pits are smooth and still hairless! I typically have hair growing after 1-2 days after shaving, so this was awesome! I definitely recommend this kit, especially for first timers willing to give it a shot at home.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of it, it a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you don&#x27;t overheat it or you will burn yourself :-)</li>
    <li> Did my own Brazilian, it took forever but the results were definitely worth it. Great wax but it does take forever to heat!</li>
    <li> When I did it, it wasn&#x27;t painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Heated the wax for about 25 minutes on HIGH and then switched it to LOW to keep it warm.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cleaned the area with alcohol pads (rubbing alcohol will do)&lt;br /&gt;2.5- rubbed hands with baby oil to keep wax from sticking- it gets messy if your first time.&lt;br /&gt;3. Rubbed the area with a bit of baby powder to keep the wax from sticking.&lt;br /&gt;4. Applied a little bit (like one/two drops) of  Pre-Epi oil (supplied) on the area and rubbed.&lt;br /&gt;5. Applied wax with applicator in direction of hair growth and made sure it was not too thin (applied about twice over).&lt;br /&gt;6. Made sure the wax was tacky and pulled really fast opposite of hair growth and then use the wax strip to pick up any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t hurt since I have plucked and I find plucking much more torturous.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, love the hard wax as opposed to getting muslin strips.</li>
    <li> I was going on a tropical vacation and I am not comfortable going to a professional bikini waxer so I bought this kit to do it at home. I also got some &amp;#34;No Scream Cream&amp;#34;, it hardly hurt at all. I have never before waxed my nether region, professionally or otherwise, and I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I like it even though I know it says Brazilian Waxing Kit I used it on my eyebrows, upper lip and underarms I am waiting for the rest to grow back in to do a Brazilian. Definitely put it on thick so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
    <li> I am new to waxing myself, but I know enough about hard wax that I wanted this for my bikini area and my armpits.  So much less pain with hard wax, and it works great.  I love that the wax insert is easily removable (as long as it is not warm) and you can slip a different can of wax in.</li>
    <li> So I do like the product of course I am not a professional at all, so it will take some getting used to and practice. It hurts and i believe the hardest part is pulling it off quickly. The product is great and I feel once i get the hang of things it will be money well spent!</li>
    <li> Really did work and kept my hair away for a long time! If you use the products they give you along with the wax you get the best results. Also,... it actually smells good too! :)</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and worth the money spent</li>
    <li> Had issues with the delivery as one of my items had spilled int the box, but the seller and amazon quickly took care of the issue so that does not have an impact on my review.  I honestly didn&#x27;t even watch the DVD or read much of the instructions.  I had looked up a couple of you tube videos prior to receiving the item so I was ready to just jump right in and try it.  Everything works as it should.  I think the wax took longer than 15-20 minutes to warm up completely...I&#x27;d say plan on about 45.  But it&#x27;s a good quality product and gave me a good result! Thanks</li>
    <li> Not sure why but it takes forever to heat up. The instructions manual says it&#x27;s 25-30 minutes but I took about an hour for it to heat up on the highest setting. Other than that issue, this works perfectly fine. Although, it hurts a LOT for waxing in my lady parts... maybe it&#x27;s just me. I couldn&#x27;t wear anything for the next few hours because it hurt so much.</li>
    <li> I didnt use the Gigi Waxing yet but when i&#x27;m open the box, the cap of the thing was broken... One star already</li>
    <li> I wish someone had informed me of the benefits of waxing many years ago. I love it! I am now very adept at waxing my upper lip and eyebrows, and they don&#x27;t even stay red for very long. Waxing is something you have to get the feel for. You have to know when the wax is hot enough, but not too hot. It must be runny enough to lock in all the hairs, but not too runny that it goes on too hot and thin. You do not want to burn your skin. I am a 33 year old woman. I&#x27;ve been shaving my upper lip since I was about 13.&lt;br /&gt;I received this kit and on the first try, I literally ripped off some hair and a lot of skin! Use the pre-wax oil, at least for your first 5-10 times. I also put chapstick on my lips very thinly, so any stray wax wouldn&#x27;t rip my thin, sensitive lip skin off. The Post Wax Cooling Gel is GREAT! It burns for a second, then starts to feel great! Turn your face towards a fan or blowing A/C, that helps with really rough sessions.&lt;br /&gt;It took a month of waxing my upper lip, giving it 3-4 days to heal, waxing again, waiting again. It took exactly 30 days for my upper lip to actually feel completely smooth! Now it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m learning to kiss again! I used to keep my upper lip far away, because I knew how it felt if a lip rubbed it the wrong way. Now, I literally have nothing to worry about! Feels smooth, silky, and even when the hairs start growing back, they are thin and soft! I love it!</li>
    <li> Wife liked it. Shipment arrived on time. Good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for for almost a year and I&#x27;m halfway done with it. I use it for facial waxing, occasional leg waxing, and bikini.</li>
    <li> Extremely hard to use. Product stuck to my skin event with the Pre Epilation Oil. Wax broke off in different areas.</li>
    <li> I loved the waxing kit that i ordered. It works great and is so easy to use. Never used the dvd so i really don&#x27;t know how much that helps. Did not like the hard wax that came with it but you can buy other waxes at places like sallys. Very easy to use and is definitely worth the money that you will spend.</li>
    <li> First of all it&#x27;s $10 cheaper on amazon than at Sally&#x27;s. Second, this kit is amazing. I had never waxed before or been professionally waxed. This was super easy to use and it honestly didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as I thought it would. I took 3 ibuprofen about 30 minutes before I waxed. Of course, there were some parts that did hurt a little but overall I&#x27;d rate the pain 4-5/10. In addition to my bikini area, I also waxed my underarms and legs and still have plenty of wax left over. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product! I wish I would have bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> ouch..just couldn&#x27;t do it..no pain tolerence..not the product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 professional brazilian waxes prior to getting this kit.  My waxer wanted me to wait 5 weeks before coming back. This kit is awesome and now I can do a full wax and touch ups in between without worrying about going back to the salon.  I swear this kit was less painful than the professional wax.  Get it now and save some money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a thin wax....hair grows back faster. Otherwise, easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Sooooooooooooo, I thought I would save money and do this from the comfort of my own home.  Bad idea.  BAD IDEA.  Even worse idea.... having my husband assist me because I just wasn&#x27;t quite getting the hang of it.  Let&#x27;s just say I had skin ripped off, wax left on, very little hair removed, and now have the scars to remember the tragedy for a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We followed the instructions precisely.  It is seriously an art to get the perfect temperature as to not leave the wax behind, nor burn yourself, and have successful hair removal.  I spoke with a close friend, who IS a professional and she laughed, then said the instructions are actually a little off.  BEWARE.  Do not let the wax set too long on your body, or it will not come off!!  And by too long, I am talking even one second too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I did not have the issue of the wax not heating up enough - it does take several hours for the entire tub to melt, but, just plan ahead and it is not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and this did not come with the epliating strips.  I ordered those separately (by Gigi) - again, timing is everything and the wax would not even adhere to the strip if it was off at all.  I found that medical wound wrap worked better than the strips! hahaha</li>
    <li> I will never get waxed at a salon again. Yes it&#x27;s messy ( hello hot dripping wax is hard to control) &amp; it takes longer. BUT nobody is going to take there time, like I will, to get all those tricky hairs.  Once you get a system down its fantastic. The Gigi Brazilian kit has changed my waxing world. I will only use the Gigi hard wax from now on!</li>
    <li> Dose not remove hair.</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect for beginners and it&#x27;s much cheaper than purchasing for Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> havent used it yet but the box came covered in epilation oil i had to wipe down everything and the bottles now 1/2 empty</li>
    <li> Never buy this item if your skin is super soft and nice like a baby. This item is definetlly not right for your private part. I waxed my bikini part the next day I got my kit and end up bleeding and yelling and burning up. I followed all the instruction. But it just not like they say, it is no good.</li>
    <li> I love the burner, however the wax that it comes with gets 2 stars. It is not the best strength. I have been waxing myself for several years and the green wax that is a little bit more costly is by far the best. The wax that comes with the kit is a little bit painful to take off. It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> this kit really does work just know what your doing.. when you get hard wax  dont use the hard wax on your arm pits wrong move lol read up and know what your doing</li>
    <li> The kit I received had oil spilled on everything. The cap for the PreEpilation Oil was off. I have newborn twins and don&#x27;t have time to return this but I also can&#x27;t use something with oil spilled all over. At least put a seal on the oil bottle...I don&#x27;t even know if it is safe to use with no seal. Very disappointed I can&#x27;t try this. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new waxing kit since Bliss raised the price of their Poetic Waxing kit by an unreasonable amount.  I saw the good ratings for the GiGi Brazilian Waxing Kit and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m glad that I did!  Not only was the GiGi kit nearly half the price as the Bliss kit, you receive three/four times more wax.  When I first saw the wax I was a bit hesitant because I thought that the waxing might hurt more.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the GiGi wax hurt a lot less.  It&#x27;s also easier to keep the wax at a constant temperature and the heating mechanism does not overheat the wax (like the microwave can do with the Bliss wax).  The only cons were 1. it does take longer to heat up the wax (about 45 mins for a full container) and 2. it&#x27;s not as effective on shorter stubble.  But the price and ease of waxing has won me over!</li>
    <li> The wax take an hour to melt.&lt;br /&gt;And the wax that remains on skin after using the waxing strips, sticks to skin and is very difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Not going to use the wax again.</li>
    <li> I just used this wax kit today and so far it has met my expectations.  Obviously I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of the warmer, but I can say that it performed well today.  The only faults I can find with this kit are that the warmer, even on the low setting, keeps the wax a bit too warm for me so I had to swirl the stick in mid air for a bit until it cooled down so I can apply, and I wish it came with more wax collars and a wax off oil.  But for the price I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself is excellent.  I like it more than the Nad&#x27;s hard wax I tried before this because it was easier to flick the edge of the wax upward to pull it off and it didn&#x27;t break off as much when pulling.  I think it removed more hair also, but that probably has to do with the nice pre-epilation oil included.  I didn&#x27;t use much at all.  The bottle will last a long while.  The wax pot is big enough for four or five brazilians for me.  I didn&#x27;t care a great deal for the post wax gel because it has alcohol, so it stings but after that subsides there is a nice cool feeling.  I just didn&#x27;t feel that it added as much as an oil to remove stray wax would.  The dvd has some useful advice for beginners.</li>
    <li> Tried this last night and followed the tutorial in the DVD that came with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I had no issues using this product. Just make sure to watch the tutorial so you don&#x27;t end up hurting your own skin during the waxing process!&lt;br /&gt;It took about 2 hours for me complete my wax session by myself. Took some figuring out and getting used to knowing when the wax is ready to be peeled.Overall this strip-free wax kit is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy waxing!</li>
    <li> I have really coarse hair &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; and have tried soo many different hair removal products, all of them resulting in nothing but painful horror stories. This wax WORKS, and it works well, as long as you take the time to learn how to use it the correct way. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of taking the time to lean the correct skills and techniques.  I spent a lot of time reading reviews and watching youtube videos on how to use hard wax, and it spared me the frustration and sticky messes other people experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never removed all of the hair from my bikini area before, and I have to admit, I&#x27;m doing little sections every few days instead of everything all at once.  After I&#x27;ve done so much waxing, the entire area gets very tender and sore and I just prefer giving my skin a break. Once the hair starts growing back in and its thinner I&#x27;ll be able to do it all in one shot.  It is extremely painful removing all of the hair for the first time, but this is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few tips and things I&#x27;ve learned along the way:&lt;br /&gt;-Before doing anything with the wax, watch the video that comes with the kit. Taking the time to do this will spare you sticky messes and an unsuccessful experience.&lt;br /&gt;-ALWAYS take ibuprofen about an hour before waxing.  It will still be extremely painful, but slightly less so than if you were to wax without it. You may also need to take it the day after waxing.  Your skin will be tender for a few days, and quite possibly bruised if you are doing a full brazilian.&lt;br /&gt;-To heat up the wax, turn the warmer on high for approximately 15 minutes, and then to low.  I have never waited for the wax to completely melt before beginning.  Personally, I prefer the thicker texture the wax has when its still melting in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;-The wax is so much easier to use when it is on the thick side. This helps to prevent dripping when you are spreading the wax and makes it easier to spread and keep it only where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;-Use the pre epilation oil, but not too much. Not using it opens up the door to ripping your skin off along with your hair and using too much could prevent the wax from properly adhering to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;-When applying the wax, spread it evenly (in the direction of your hair growth) and DO NOT spread out the edges.  You want the wax to be about an eighth of an inch thick in the middle and thicker on the edges.  I learned from watching videos that this helps to maintain the structure of the wax and will prevent leftover bits from sticking to your skin when you rip it off.&lt;br /&gt;-If you are using the wax for the first time, make sure you practice on your legs or arms first.  You DO NOT want to learn on your bikini area; this could easily result in painful mistakes and lots of sticky wax in areas you really do not want it to be.&lt;br /&gt;-Remove excess bits of wax with baby oil, and do this while the wax is still slightly soft.  Once it is hard, the only thing you can do is pick at it or rip out the hair that it is sticking to.&lt;br /&gt;-A few people mentioned that they strain and reuse their wax.  This is tempting because it saves money, however I would not recommend it.  Doing this can promote bacterial growth in your wax, and you DO NOT want this to happen.  Freshly waxed skin is extremely prone to infection, so keeping your supplies and tools clean and sanitary is incredibly important.  The last thing you want is to end up in the hospital with an infection because you were not keeping your supplies sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;-Inform yourself about how to care for post waxed skin before beginning.  Like I said, freshly waxed skin is extremely prone to infection, and it needs to be taken care of properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I really do love this product. I am SO excited that I&#x27;ve finally found something that works and works well.  Buying the kit was especially handy, and the warmer is so much better than going back and forth between the bathroomand the microwave. Even though the wax is mean specifically for coarse hair, I have used it on my upper lip and eyebrows with success.  It is significantly less painful that the wax strips I typically use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would most definitely recommend this kit to anyone who prefers waxing in the comfort of your home and is patient enough to take the time to learn to use this product properly.</li>
    <li> Works great just read and research on how to use it first to keep from getting burned. This is not a plug and play item. It does take some common sense to keep from getting hurt. Do the homework. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> Great price, great quality, fast shipping. I had never waxed before, and researched like crazy before purchasing this kit. The hard wax is awesome! Yes, waxing hurts, some areas more than others, but this hard wax does not stick to your skin, just the hair, so that helps reduce the pain of waxing in general. I got better results without using the oil, it seems the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin anyways, and the oil sometimes makes the wax not stick to the hair. I recommend buying some oral numbing stuff, like a dentist uses and not any of the \\&quot;waxing\\&quot; specific stuff they sell, it doesn&#x27;t work as well and is over priced. Go with this kit if you are looking for a great quality and complete waxing kit for all areas of the body. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Hated it. Could not get he wax off. Actually bruised my legs.</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time. It&#x27;s really easy to use, no complications and excellent results. The wax warmer takes longer time than what it&#x27;s specified, so it&#x27;s not perfect. You need to consider that to start to use the wax, you will have to wait at least 15 mins more than what they say.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It heats up in a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;- There is PLENTY of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Might want to order extra pre-epilation oil and post wax cooling gel. Two ounces goes fast!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and is much easier and less messy than soft wax. It takes some time to get used to placing the wax just right, but it works great at getting all the hairs the first time. The different size applicators are great too! Makes it so much easier getting to those smaller areas. I also love the post wax cooling gel, it works wonderfully and makes the area feel so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does still hurt, it&#x27;s not pain free by any means. You are pulling hair from the root out of sensitive areas after all.</li>
    <li> I had my first-ever waxing experience 2 weeks ago using the wax strips on just my legs and that was pretty painful. Then she did my lip with the strips and that was really quick and pretty painless. Afterward I did some research and found out about hard wax. I read everything I could find about it and decided to purchase this kit because of the helpful reviews and it was so much cheaper than what it would have cost to buy in store around town. I am SO GLAD I decided to buy this kit! It lives up to all the other great reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. I am pretty impatient and a quick learner, so when the package arrived yesterday I decided to watch the DVD which was informative, then I decided to try the brazillian wax on myself. Let me first state that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that if you don&#x27;t have a have a high pain tolerance. I do, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Mind you I have NEVER had even a bikini wax. But the whole experience went better than I imagined! I put the collar on the wax jar and warmed it on high until it was about 50% melted. Then I stirred a little because the edges warm first, then let it melt some more. I turned it to medium once it was about 85% melted, stirred and tested it on my wrist. Not only was this good for temperature, but I put enough on to make a little strip and got some practice waiting the right amount of time before flicking up an end and ripping off. I did that 3 times and by that point was very confident I could do this. I washed and dried the area while the wax melted, rubbed in less than a dime size of the pre-epilation oil and wiped off the excess, then started the wax. I started with the bigger applicator stick but I don&#x27;t recommend that unless you&#x27;ve had this area waxed before. I soon switched to the medium size stick and did smaller areas (like so many others had suggested in the first place!) and that felt a lot better! I also took some advice I read online and coughed while I ripped off the wax. It distracts from the pain, and about midway through the waxing I knew which spots I would need to do that for and which were not as sensitive, as coughing for every single pull can get annoying! I found that the lower abdomen hair was MUCH more painful to pull out than those further down or on the sides. Little dots of blood are normal as you are ripping out very thick hair; just keep a paper towel on hand and blot (don&#x27;t wipe!) as needed. After I was done I put the gigi cooling gel on a cotton ball and GENTLY rubbed that all over the waxed areas. It was very cool and soothing. There is a tutorial I found that was extrememly informative and really made me want to buy my own kit and try it: [...] I&#x27;m so excited about the amount of money I&#x27;ll save doing this myself and how easy it turned out to be. Another important note: because the wax only adheres to the hair and not the skin, I found it very helpful to be able to wax areas more than once to remove the few hairs that didn&#x27;t come out the first time around. If you do not have a high pain tolerance and have never waxed before, I would recommend trying the legs first! If you&#x27;ve done that but have never done a bikini or brazillian before I would strongly recommend starting with the bikini and seeing how that goes first. Bye bye razor!!! Happy waxing :)</li>
    <li> This kit came in handy for me to do my waxes at home, its too expensive running to the salon every two weeks to get my body waxed, this works perfect.</li>
    <li> I am a home user and have found it easy to use. They need to package the lid a bit better as it arrived cracked and pieces falling off of it. Otherwise I&#x27;m enjoying not having to pay someone else to do the waxing for me. :D</li>
    <li> Takes forever to warm, It takes about 45 min to an hour completely melt the wax. When applied to the skin it dries very quickly sometimes even before you get chance put on the strips. Have to be very quick about applying the strips after the wax. Otherwise it works fine.</li>
    <li> This compact waxing kit is so worth the price! Easy to use and the extras are good to have! Just don&#x27;t make the wax too hot!! Watch the DVD, it helps!</li>
    <li> Very high quality and great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for doing this yourself t is still difficult to use on your own though and takes a lot of practice to perfect. I&#x27;m still trying to work out using it on my entire bikini area. There&#x27;s definitely a reason to just go and get it done professionally, but it can also be fun to wax yourself/ have a spa day at home. I think it hurts more to do it yourself though and it more messy/ hard to perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, dont use too much pre-epilation oil or the hairs with not pull out correctly and with just rip out without the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its great if you have patience, more time and tolerance for pain.</li>
    <li> im a licensed cosmetologist and this was a great deal the quality is perfect like expected!</li>
    <li> does just as expected, no problems.  I would recommend.  Great price.  Easy to use and does not take long to warm up.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend asked me to get him a waxing kit for his back. I bought this product because it had great ratings and seemed simple to use. Cloth strips are not included in this and they&#x27;re not required as the wax dries and is decently easy to pull. It was pretty messy, however, so I would recommend buying strips. We had 1/4 of the wax leftover, but his back wasn&#x27;t exactly a forest. The kit comes with an explicit instructional video, which will make a great white elephant gift. I&#x27;m sure if we were using the kit for the specified purpose, I would appreciate the video. However, we just found it funny.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and excellent product!</li>
    <li> Its amazing! Hope it came with the paper for it though</li>
    <li> So much better than shaving..plus I save so much money, rather than getting professionally waxed.</li>
    <li> Came with a broken lid</li>
    <li> This is the exactly the same brand they use in salons. This wax is super sticky and strong. I tried it for a Brazillian wax. Let&#x27;s just say I definitely need more practice. It is great for those coursers hair. However, it is so sticky if you get stuck in an area that is too thick, it is way too painful to rip off. You will definitely have to hop in the shower. It gets everywhere. Be careful. Great product and warmer. Will buy the refills.</li>
    <li> I have never waxed anything myself before. There is a little bit of a learning curve but the second time I felt like a pro. Everything I needed was in this kit for less than the cost of a professional wax. Turned out to be a good investment for me.</li>
    <li> worked very well and was pretty simple to use, I am really pleased with the results that I have had.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. Extremely easy to use for waxing beginners. Awesome deal compared to beauty stores as well. Defiantly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> Works great but be prepared. It takes about 30-45 minutes to warm up and can be very messy and painful. After waxing my hair didn&#x27;t grow back for at least two weeks. Really get the extra collars to protect your machine!!! This was my first time using hot wax so for full arms and legs it took me a good 4-5 hours. But it was worth it. I would recommend baby oil to remove excess wax.</li>
    <li> Great product! The DVD is not appropiate for kids unerage!! But said that, it is really good, great material, great wax and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this for waxing my underarms. Works like a charm. Must use the pre-oil that the product contains though, otherwise you will have a lot more pain and the wax won&#x27;t peel off in one swoop.</li>
    <li> I like it. Really easy in using, good quality and price</li>
    <li> I liked this product.</li>
    <li> This works great for my family. In one afternoon, I had already paid for the kit on what it would have cost my daughter and me to have eyebrows/facial waxing done. We love it!!</li>
    <li> Bought this kit based on the good reviews and it is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;The wax is very good quality and it&#x27;s not sore at all for the bikini area. You just need to get the hang of the amount of wax to put.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is that the wax it comes with makes me break out- and leaves your skin greasy. Just use another wax</li>
    <li> Met my expectations.  I have paid salons for years.  This paid for itself with the first use.  DVD provided should answer any questions you may have.  This worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> All you need for the Brazilian wax. Yes hard wax is tricky so change it with Gigi honey if you have some experience of self waxing.</li>
    <li> Not as advertised and you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxed professional before kids but now, I not only don&#x27;t have the time, I feel guilty wasting the money but shaving REALLY irritates my skin.  So, I&#x27;ve tried all the over the counter wax options and they all hurt and pull no hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax REALLY does work but it is VERY time consuming...however, next time I imagine it will go faster because there&#x27;s a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) the wax takes about nearly an hour to heat up&lt;br /&gt;2) sit on something you are fine with throwing out and don&#x27;t try to avoid dripping on the towel because if the wax drips on your those little drips hurt like a BIATCH to get off and you have to use tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;3) try to to rub the wax on the hair so it catches all of it in small lines or ovals when applying and do SMALL patches or it will just hurt more&lt;br /&gt;4) I had to go over some areas twice...which hurts more...but I have VERY thick, corse hair</li>
    <li> Besides that the package&#x27;s content was oily all over due to the leakage of the pre-waxing oil, this kit is useless. I watched the 15-min video made in 1999 (and/or 2002) introducing products that were not even in the kit. Instead of explaining how to operate the kit, they were showing explicit pictures of female genitals (not that I care too much about, but I would have been more interested in walking me through the steps what and how to do with the kit). It took more than an hour to make the wax fluid. I used it for both bikini and underarm waxing. For me, it did not work. It is a hard wax, but very weak. I could not pull off the wax in one or two pieces, but in many, and hard time removing all the small pieces (and I have done waxing before with other products). When I put pre-waxing oil on the area, the wax did not remove any hair whatsoever. This product clearly failed working, and I regret that I bought it. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> We use this at my beauty school and for those who dont get the right temp. We usually leave it at where the red light is we never move it and its the perfect temp!</li>
    <li> So in love with my Gigi warmer! I have been waxing at home for about a year now and I&#x27;ve used the Bliss Poetic hard wax. It&#x27;s a microwaveable wax and let me tell you, that&#x27;s a pain! This warmer is so awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit has wax applicator sticks, one container of hard wax, pre-wax oil, post-wax cooling gel and of course the warmer itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was worth every penny because it paid for itself in the first use! A trip to the salon for everything I was able to wax with the container it came with would have cost me over $100 and a cup of Bliss Poetic which would have covered 1/4 of what I waxed would have cost me $50 so this was a steal!</li>
    <li> this thing just took of some of my skin and left all the hair horrible product</li>
    <li> Great product! Very user friendly- I&#x27;ve only had a bikini wax done professionally twice and this product was just as good!</li>
    <li> Used it to wax upper lip and between eyebrows.</li>
    <li> A couple of things first...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you&#x27;re looking at the pictures of the woman with sticky hands that scare you off like it almost did me, SHE IS DOING IT WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;2. I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo&#x27;s and bad reviews scared me at first.  I am very new to home waxing and spent some time reading reviews on many different products.  Hard wax is known for being less painful which is a big reason I wanted to try it.  Let me tell you, I am so happy I did! Watch youtube videos and the video that comes with the kit before trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching a lot of at home instructional video&#x27;s I was ready to try it and got the hang of it in no time.  No residue on my hands.  Slight sticky residue on the area&#x27;s waxed but that came off really easy with some of the Gigi wax remover.  It wasn&#x27;t very painful except in a few sensitive area&#x27;s. This kit comes with a variety of applicator sizes which is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HINT: It sounds silly but use a was strip with this strip less wax! It works perfectly and no mess whatsoever.  It even grabs the littlest pieces that may get left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now addicted to waxing and the smoothness lasts so long!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. There was a crack in the cover and the supplier sent a replacement.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Gets the job done. Takes a bit to melt the wax. Inexpensive and repays itself.</li>
    <li> This worked pretty good. The only real complaint is that with our unit it was challenging to regulate the temperature of the wax. It seemed to get too hot on low so we had to switch it off and on. Not sure if this is how it&#x27;s supposed to work.</li>
    <li> The wax is not actual gigi brand wax, it made my eczema break out on my leg and it still hasn&#x27;t gone away and it&#x27;s been two weeks. I have the mildest eczema ever! I only get dry patches on my arms sometimes in the summer and winter. I saw another reviewer say this stuff ins&#x27;t legit so I went to sally&#x27;s beauty supply and it works way better and I haven&#x27;t broken out once. Just go to sallys and buy the space saving warmer for $24 and they have all the waxes and lotions too.</li>
    <li> Heat seems like it&#x27;s difficult to manage -- sometimes it&#x27;s a perfect, &amp;#34;thick honey&amp;#34; consistency at medium or high, and sometimes even on low it&#x27;s completely liquid hot and burns to the touch. Also takes much longer to heat up and melt than the instructions say -- they say &amp;#34;20 mins to half hour on high&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve learned to just turn it on and leave it for closer to an hour before even checking, and a lot of the time there will still be a solid wax chunk in the middle (but the melted parts on the sides are still workable). The slider also is a little bit hard to work with, since it will slide back slightly from where you leave it, which also seems like it makes it very hard to turn &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; ? It will always slide back nearer to the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting and turn the light back on. Not a big deal since you can always unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely keeps the wax liquid though, has never hardened too much or turned solid again while on. Will just take some playing around with the heat settings and turning it off sometimes to keep it right. Would have given 5 stars if the heater itself was more consistent and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Also not sure if it was some kind of coincidence, but I got much better results the times I used it WITHOUT the pre epilation oil. Even using very little it seemed like it made the wax less likely to stick to my hair as well, and when using no oil at all I never had any issues with the wax sticking too much to my skin, and the pain seemed the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the consistency you use it at, the wax is VERY messy -- either leaves thin &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; of wax from the pot to wherever you&#x27;re putting it no matter how much you wipe it off, or just straight up drips, but it does dry hard so it&#x27;s easy to pick off of anything it lands on later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the waxing itself, it&#x27;s mostly trial and error to figure out what works for you and your hair/skin, but this is definitely a good kit to learn since you don&#x27;t have to be worrying about manually reheating your wax and can take your time and relax.have to be worrying about manually reheating your wax and can take your time and relax.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Totally worth this price.</li>
    <li> Works great! Very clean!</li>
    <li> Read the instructions in the reviews - I&#x27;ve tried EVERY method out there, and this is by far the easiest (once you get the hang of it and the right temp), and lasts the longest!  Never shaving again!</li>
    <li> The product itself is good but I also received a broken hardcover. I wish it was made clear this was hard wax in the heading. I didnt read the details which is kinda my fault. I meant to buy soft wax but I can use either. I received hard wax.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Does take time to melt all the way. jell and oil very helpful. great set</li>
    <li> I love it but ing hard time to use Brazilian wax..but i will try honey wax...</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and works perfectly</li>
    <li> Love love love it, its great, it has everything you will need. i really recommend this product. I got it with in a week of ordering it. its also alot cheaper than getting it at sallys, or ordering all the stuff separately.</li>
    <li> This waxing kit works great. It even comes with a DVD to show beginners how to wax properly. I was not expecting this kit to work so well because of the price. I was wrong. The kit also came on time and was exactly why I ordered.</li>
    <li> So my first waxing kit I completely murdered! :( didn&#x27;t realize how hard wax is to get off :) lets just say I made a mess and had wax allllll over it. So I bought a new one (this one) that comes with the ring collar to put around the top of the wax can so it doesn&#x27;t mess up your waxing pot! This is a must have! saves me sooo much money since I can do it myself! I have had mine for several months now with no problem at all! Just remember you DO NOT want your wax to hot so the lowest setting is perfect!</li>
    <li> A nice complete kit.  If you can get over the special kind of torture that self-waxing is you&#x27;ll be very happy with the savings v. going to the salon.  I&#x27;ll spare you the hysterical and embarrassing story of my first time using this product and simply remind you to read and follow the directions (something I did not do very thoroughly but learned my lesson about).  Since doing so I&#x27;ve successfully waxed several times and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this waxing kit!!  In S. America I could get a bikini wax for $8, back in the states I was charged $70!!!!  This kit is a great deal, saves LOADS of money and it&#x27;s a pretty easy thing to do yourself anyway.</li>
    <li> Gigi is now my go to for all things wax related. This was my first kit. The warmer is universally sized but having tried other non Gigi waxes that&#x27;s not a concern because I&#x27;m only using Gigi. This said, brazilians are not for me (to perform on myself anyway!) but the Brazilian hard wax is very good for chin/upper lip waxing too so it wasn&#x27;t a waste, and when you consider the cost of the warmer alone, it&#x27;s well worth the investment. I just buy my azulene or honey wax and pop it in the warmer as needed. Good investment in personal grooming.</li>
    <li> Be careful. There are no wax strips included in this the box. Overall it takes the wax a nit to heat up, but works like magic!</li>
    <li> I got this set and have used it for all sorts of waxing. I find the oil makes the wax hard to apply and make stick (so I don&#x27;t use the oil and unfortunately it is a bit more painful because the wax sticks to your skin more) but overall, I like the wax and the heater works well.</li>
    <li> I have never had a professional wax done, that being said I was not sure what to expect. But I&#x27;m addicted to waxing now! Watch the video for new users!! The hardest part is ripping off you own wax. Pop a couple Advil. Do not use too much of the prepilating oil or the wax won&#x27;t still to all the hair as well. Absolutely love doing my under arms with this</li>
    <li> You get better and better the more you do it! The only thing I won&#x27;t wax myself are my eyebrows, since that has the potential to go horribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same product that a lot of the professional salons use and you save a ton of money. Also the convenience of having this around for a quick touch up before a date or interview. I use with strips for my face.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and as advertised</li>
    <li> Great kit! I am a first time home waxer and this is very easy to use. Turn it on High and let it warm up for at least 20 minutes before se. Wax is the perfect temp and is not too hot to use in sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> This wax kit is such a bargain. I feel like a thief getting away with it! The hard wax included waxes like a dream and is so much less painful. I was spending $9 every two weeks (bushy Italian eyebrows) to get mine waxed. This kit paid for itself in two and half months time. I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and armpits as well and I am still shocked how much this does not hurt. The key to the hard wax is to be generous and let it set on your hair long enough. Too little wax and you won&#x27;t be able to pull it off. Flick up the edge, then grab hold of it firmly and pull. Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m too chicken, I have used this to give my partner a Brazilian and she was in heaven. She had one bad experience at a salon and almost wouldn&#x27;t let me give her one. Now she doesn&#x27;t dread it and it gives great results! The hard wax does not cause irritation and is effective yet gentle on the skin. I have recommended this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> First time trying this out and kind of hurt my self a bit. Wish it had better instructions on the packing.</li>
    <li> I like using it on my legs, lips, and eyebrows.  it&#x27;s easy to use, and have fun with it.  I think its a great starter product.</li>
    <li> OMGGGGGGGG I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I personally do not care for the CD does not really help too much... if at all. So I ordered it for my underarms. When I shave my underarm I have to use a brand new razor each time. Plus if I try to reuse a razor I break out into a rash. Also my underarm hair has like 3 hairs in one spot plus I get a lot of ingrown hairs. When I do shave on day one by day 2 you can feel the hair and by day 4 it is visible. So I waxed for the first time. Never waxed before. Ordered it monday and received it Wednesday. I waxed my underarm Wednesday night same day I got my package. 8 days later, my hair on my underarms are still not visible. Only the hair that I did not tweeze which you can only see if you get very close. Day 8 on wax still looks 10000x&#x27;s better than day 2 of shaving. it is difficult at first because i have never waxed before so it took me a lot longer to complete. I do use the lotions. I did my arms two days after my underarm and noticed that on one arm I did not use the prewax oil and I did miss a lot of hairs. I read the reviews and still was hesitant but I already ordered more hard wax, which does not come with strips because what you put on acts as a strip. I did not know that. I thought it was wax then you put something on to peel it off. Hard wax you put over hair and let it harden then peel it off. love it even on the sensitive areas. I still have not done my private area because I am scared about the pain. Once I do it, I will do another smaller review. I love this product. I had no break outs, perfect and trust me when I did my allergy test, my doctor highlighted everything I was NOT allergic too so I was surprised finally for once I did not react like I do when I get my eye brows done. Since check ingredients like I did but it was great.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Nothing special for me. I don&#x27;t think the wax would harden enough though to pull off.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this kit except the wax.  I expected wax that you did not have to apply material strips to and got a rude awakening.  Luckily I purchased other wax at the same time that does not require material strips for and was able to apply it over the top of this wax to get it off of my legs.  Dry was that does not require any material strips works so much better and seems less painful.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this product in the mail. I have always wanted to have a wax cat but never had the confidence to pay someone to do it. The DVD very informational and gave me a bases of how to wax. The  wax was set a perfect temp. I felt as though I had everything I needed. It took me over two hours of experimenting to do my legs arm-pits and start the cat. trying to figure out the technique was kind of fun -and painful.. What I didn&#x27;t like was the wax. The hard wax is really good for legs and firm surfaces but other surfaces that are not as firm, the wax did not dry evenly. Which would either be too gooie or would crack and break off. Which was all the more painful! So I will be investing in a different wax specifically for that area. Other then that the if you choose to buy this kit you need to get GiGi Wax Off Remover For skin.. It helps you get the remaining wax off.</li>
    <li> I got this because I had been using the smaller hard wax brazillian kit by GiGi and loved it - but the trips to the microwave were perilous. It&#x27;s hard to keep the temp between useless and scalding. So I got the warmer kit, but the wax doesn&#x27;t get hard as fast with this one. It seems to be a different kind of wax entirely? It takes forever, and, um, hurts a bit more when you do finally pull it off. My poor lady bits!!</li>
    <li> Guys send your girl to the waxer for the first time.  It was a long painful 2 hours first time wax i gave my girl and i had left a lot of strays, you need a pro to do the first couple waxes.  The 2nd time i did it i was getting better but man it is a head ache. just send your girl to get waxed,</li>
    <li> Have to give a good review!&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would take a few days, however I received it the 2nd day morning. I was really surprised!&lt;br /&gt;Follow the dvd, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! Good product!</li>
    <li> This hard wax is awesome, it is the best one I have every used so far! I love it, definately worth it. I will come back again once I finished mine.</li>
    <li> Love this don&#x27;t ever have to pay for waxing again super easy comes with DVD! fast shipping!</li>
    <li> As long as you use a numbing cream or spray before hand, its not too hard to do, I gave myself a bikini wax and it pulled most of my hard out in the areas I used it and I had maybe 3 bumps afterwards.... when I get it done professionally I have a bunch of bumps. This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really pleased that I finally caved in and bought this wax warmer. I&#x27;ve used Gigi products in the past, but would just buy those little microwave containers, thinking, &amp;#34;Oh, I&#x27;m not a salon, I&#x27;m not fancy like that. I don&#x27;t need a fancy contraption dedicated just to waxing...&amp;#34; The problem with those little microwave kits is that towards the last fifth of the container, the waxes get all crusty and don&#x27;t heat properly. You also waste a lot of time stopping the process to get up and reheat the wax again and again. This warmer&#x27;s constant temperature is worth it: it&#x27;s very convenient AND saves money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax it comes with it amazing. The formulation adheres strictly to the No Hair Left Behind Act. It&#x27;s a stripless wax, which means you spread it on and then rip off just the wax itself. However, sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to get the strip started and you&#x27;re left with these little bits stuck to your hand. If you&#x27;re really quick, you can get a fabric strip on top of the wax before it cools. The benefit of using a strip is you can also manage to wax a larger/longer area in one go. Without a strip, you need to work in short 1/2 to 1 1/2 inch areas. It&#x27;s probably better to learn the stripless method (economically and ecologically speaking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this wax&#x27;s amazing sticking power is that it likes to leave teeny, tiny little sticky remnants all over. Sugar waxes spoil you with how easy they are to clean up: just wash away! With this stuff, you&#x27;ll think you&#x27;ve gotten all of it off and then find weird little lint-spots on your skin later that day. Not especially great when you&#x27;ve just waxed your face and then you have a cotton ball fuzz mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like about the kit is that, as with every other Gigi waxing kit, it recommends using the Pre-Hon cleanser. Unlike every other Gigi waxing kit, it does not come with said cleanser. It also does not come with the Slow-Grow treatment for after waxing.</li>
    <li> I have tried other at home waxing kits before (soft wax, never hard wax like this product) and cannot believe how easy this product made the wax. The DVD that accompanies the product gives very clear instructions on how the wax should be applied and removed. After only a few test strips I was able to get the process down pretty well. This might not replace my monthly waxing routine, but will absolutely come in handy in a pinch when I don&#x27;t have time to get to the waxer. I highly recommend this product, and as a waxing veteran can tell you that this experience was fairly painless!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to this whole waxing thing, so maybe I should have known better. Call me naive, but I believed the packaging and product description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Gigi Brazilian waxing kit is a complete hair removal system that provides everything needed to perform a Brazilian waxing service.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get my kit in the mail, get ready to wax my privates, plug it in, read the instructions... and realize that I need something called &amp;#34;muslin strips&amp;#34;, which are sold separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this kit works great once you get all the stuff, but I&#x27;m giving it one star for false advertising.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit and you really don&#x27;t need to watch the DVD that comes with it. It took about 45 minutes to heat up the wax &amp; I worked from the outside in with no problems. The hair came out pretty good &amp; would recommend leaving the wax on for about 30 seconds to a minute before removing. Overall this kit is a good investment b/c you can wax in the privacy of your own home &amp; it will end up saving you money in the long run.</li>
    <li> This kit works really great.  The DVD  was very helpful too. I would recommend turning the warmer on high for 30 min then turn to low for 15-20 min. Also, do urself a favor and get some of the wax remover gel just in case. Most of the wax did come off but there were a few small spots where there was a little wax residue remaining, some remover wouldve been helpful. It hurts, a lot but it&#x27;s not intolerable. Comperable to getting a tattoo. Having ur bf do it for u helps a lot as well. Especially if he&#x27;s a dork and pretends he&#x27;s a beautician like mine did, made me smile and helped distract me from what was about to happen. Way better than some stuck up salon wench. I have some seriously sensitive skin and had no reaction to the wax, pre epilation oil or the post gel. All around a great product. Will definitely be ordering more wax when this  runs out.</li>
    <li> Takes a few strips to perfect the technique, but doesn&#x27;t  take long to master. I also use this wax on my armpits and upper lips with great results. Just the price alone is cheaper than a Brazilian at any salon. Pays for itself you&#x27;re willing to learn how to wax yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI, the video is extremely detailed and gives a full frontal view of a client receiving a Brazilian Waxing service. Not for the squeamish, for sure, as there is nudity.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase. A complete hair removal kit . Im not comfortable of going to saloon for bikini hair removal. In fact it was my first trial on hard waxing..Recommended.</li>
    <li> This was my first time waxing ever. I was skeptical about going to an actual salon or spa, so I figured I&#x27;ll try it at home first to see what it was like. I let it heat it for about an hour and attempted to give myself a brazilian wax. It was difficult doing it alone because you need to be flat in order for the wax not to run. I also had trouble making sure the wax was thick enough. Let it dry for a good twenty or thirty seconds, or else you will make a huge mess and be forced to pull the broken strip multiple times, which is very painful. I didn&#x27;t use gloves and had wax all over my nails. Have baby oil within reach for removing excess wax on skin! All in all, decent product and good buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Must buy cloth strips separately.  I would recommend this product to anyone for professional or personal use.</li>
    <li> product is exactly as described and as long as you know how to use it, its great. I used to work in a salon and this is exactly what we used, but cheaper than buying in the beauty supply store</li>
    <li> Best home waxing kit! Super easy to use and maintain! Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> It hurt like hell, but it works!!! I am a complete newbee to self-waxing. This was a major mess the first time, but it worked! I ordered the kit after seeing Naptural85 use on her YouTube channel.  I was going to the salon every 3 weeks to get my chin, brows, sideburns and lip done. For a total of over $40, there had to be a better way. Every 3 weeks, that adds up! Finally, I decided to just get it! The week of our moving our home I was a hairy mess after preparing for the move, packing, moving, unpacking, the hassle of the movers, hubby, pets. The week was a mess and I did not have time to go to the salon to get my hairy self waxed before the move and I was horrified at how much stress makes your hair grow ;o) I plugged this in on Sunday afternoon (around 3p) putting it on high. Went in to check on the wax around 4p, it was melted. I turned the tempure down to low and went and put my load of laundry in. Around 6p I went into the bathroom to use this wax. I got wax all over the place (buy the collars, this does not come with and they help keep the burner clean). Wax was on me, the floor, the sink, I couldn&#x27;t find my strips, so I had to wait and let the wax dry until slightly hard and use my fingers to pull it off, but all the hair came off on the first try! It hurt like hell, but I was smooth. I did my chin, lip and sideburns. I&#x27;m not ready to put this wax near my eyes yet ;o)</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! Everyone should have one!</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. That makes me happy :)</li>
    <li> My granddaughter likes it!</li>
    <li> Works well and relatively inexpensive. I still prefer to have someone else inflict the pain. There is something about ripping hot wax off yourself that is pretty twisted. The wax took quite a while to heat all the way, but didn&#x27;t get too hot. Overall a good buy, but I don&#x27;t see myself using it as often, only because I prefer sugar waxing. Less mess</li>
    <li> I love this system!  Already paid for itself in 1 use.  I can use it in the privacy of my own home, no more $75 - $80 waxing expenses and it gives me the same results.  My only regret is that I wish I would have searched this product earlier and saved myself even more.</li>
    <li> This is the best wax I have ever used and definitely triumphs anything I have bought from a retail store. After waxing, my legs stayed smooth for nearly a whole month, as opposed to shaving which lasts me only a few days. It&#x27;s a very simple (and yes, even relaxing) process once you get the hang of it and the DVD does include a few helpful tips. I have found it&#x27;s important not to overheat the wax, as this makes it harder to work with and much messier. To avoid that problem, I never set the temperature above Medium and this keeps it at a nice consistency. The smallest sticks included are great for eyebrows; I cut the end of the stick at an angle for easier application. This is an awesome kit for anyone considering at home waxing, and I will definitely be ordering the refills to have on hand.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item last week, used it for the first time tonight. I&#x27;ve never waxed anything on my body before in my life, total amateur and everything turned out absolutely perfect. I&#x27;m in love with this product and how much money it&#x27;s going to save me each year.</li>
    <li> The kit came with all the items except for the cloth strips to remove hair.  The Pre Epilation oil leaked during shipment and everything was covered in oil :(.  Everything was packaged separately and didn&#x27;t get damaged though.</li>
    <li> Used over 10 different waxing products that were much more expensive than this (and that was just that wax). This not only came with everything needed but also has the very effective and useful wax warmer. That way your not running from the kitchen to the bathroom when the family is still home. Wax works great and pulls hair better than most. Remember for tips and tricks just search for it, but best method that I have used was to make sure the wax is on a section of light - no hair so that it is easy to get started.</li>
    <li> The wax is impossible to grip and remove. I hate it. The warmer is very nice though. I am going back to hot wax with strips.</li>
    <li> Why have I been going to the salon paying $10 for a lip wax and $20 for eyebrows when I can do this at home!? Wonderful kit. I haven&#x27;t used the hard wax. I purchased a separate tin of the honey wax and it works perfectly. Some complain that it&#x27;s messy or too sticky, but I think it just takes getting used to the formula. I&#x27;m happy with it. It&#x27;s the same stuff I&#x27;ve seen the ladies in the wax salons use.</li>
    <li> Soooo this product is hard to use if you don&#x27;t know how...the wax can get everywhere but put a sheet down and you&#x27;re fine. Luv Brazilian hard wax..I think it hurts less</li>
    <li> Great warmer, oil, and spreader sticks, but don&#x27;t use the wax!  It&#x27;s horrible! Flakes, goes on too thin and is a bitch to get off in one piece.  Get the Cirepil, also sold on amazon, then you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
    <li> The kit came quickly with all that was suppose to be included. 2 stars because the lid was broken into multiple pieces and the return policy doesn&#x27;t allow for exchange/replacement. It does however heat wax, so I won&#x27;t give it 1 star.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!!! I usually have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve shaved for a long time and my skin was horrible after I shaved I had black bumps all over and my hair grew like the next day l. So I decided to give this a try and oh man!!✋🏼 I love it it was a huge difference my skin looks different and my hair grew back after 2 weeks not extremely ether like just lil but if hairs....it would of been nice if the wax was bigger I usually finished it by just using it on legs and Brazilian area. It does have some ups and downs like when you wax your legs it doesn&#x27;t take all the hairs off it just leaves few lil hair like to take them off with your tweezers And it did warm up for a while the first time it only took mines 35 mins but when I warm it up again it takes me 15 - 20 mins</li>
    <li> Great!  I still use strips with the hard wax, because it makes pulling it up so much easier and painless for me.  Love it.  Best wax I&#x27;ve ever used.  Watch Sally beauty supply for the buy one get one free wax pots in the summer!</li>
    <li> My favorite must have!</li>
    <li> The wax kit itself was OK. I used the pre preparation oil and baby powder as well to protect my skin but the heater for the wax is very powerful and its hard to keep a consistant temp for the wax. The wax got way to hot a few times and I burned my skin and had to keep turning the heater on and off to prevent from burning my skin to keep it a a safe and comfortable temperature. Also the wax is a little harsh I would use a different kind maybe something made to use for waxing your bikini area or the more delicate areas of your body (Brazilian waxing) and I suggest having your man or friend help you with your back end the was is hard to get off and can be painful and messy.</li>
    <li> The kit is perfect but there are better hard waxes out there for Brazilians (this stuff is painful) get the kit but buy the Cerepil (spelling?) blue wax. For everything other than brazilian gigi&#x27;s soft wax with the strips are amazing. I can only use gigi hard wax for arms and facial hair.</li>
    <li> I can only give it a 3 star for now.  The wax and warmer are great....my arm pits, lip and eyes turned out good...but trying it on my bikini line was nuts!!  What a mess!  All over the sink, hands, floor, everywhere!!!  Once on the skin the wax only came off in lil sections...It took 2 hours to finally get it off my skin!!  I&#x27;m not giving up on it just yet..I&#x27;m going to have my husband help the next time I do the bikini and between the cheeks area!!</li>
    <li> Let me just start off by saying that I&#x27;ve struggled with shaving my whole life. Razors have become sworn enemies of mine. I would shave and get razor burn, ingrown hairs, cuts, redness, irritation. No matter how clean of a shave I got it still was not smooth, was left cut and red. I would get a few hours of leeway before the hair already started to grow back. By the next day stubble was already back. This is my first time trying waxing and this kit was so simple to use. I love it! Im still smooth going on 2 days. Redness does occur but it faded over night. Im very impressed with the outcome. All waxing is painful, but this pain wasn&#x27;t too intense to handle. It wasn&#x27;t that painful to me. The only issue I had was that I warmed up the wax too much and it had a hard time pulling towards the end. But that was users fault. I feel so confident now that I feel like my goods are razor burn free! Thank you so much for my confidence back</li>
    <li> Pre wax oil did come spilled but it wasn&#x27;t too bad! I use this for bikini, armpit and upper lip waxing! LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I have not gotten the chance to use the kit yet, but it arrived on time. I just want to mention that my Pre Epilation Oil was unscrewed and leaked all over the box. I was pretty upset by it, because I need to spend more money to purchase another bottle. I&#x27;ll edit this review when I actually utilize the kit.</li>
    <li> This kit is great and affordable.  The wax is a little sticky and I wish I could find a cleaner to get the residue off my sink, but it definitely does the job.  The warmer also keeps the wax at a good temperature that won&#x27;t burn you if you follow the instructions provided.</li>
    <li> The warmer works, if anything too well.  I followed the directions for how long to leave on high before turning to low and I think it was too long and the wax was a little too hot so it was not thick enough.  For future uses, I think I will watch it more closely and when there is only a small amount of unmelted wax left in the middle, turn it to low.  The package comes with everything needed to get started and the video is helpful.  Pain level and how good a job it does purely depends on skill which I think will develop over time and practice.  I had great results when I applied the wax properly and at the right temp.  Other places I had some hair breakage but mostly where I applied the wax too hot/thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying it on an easier spot first, I did the tops of my feet and my big toe which insist on growing fuzzy hairs.  Standard bikini was not too bad.  Going for the Brazilian is a little more difficult.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend a sphynx on first try unless you have someone to help you.  You almost need three hands, two to pull the skin taut from top and bottom, and one to yank off the wax.  If you aren&#x27;t used to waxing yourself, it is going to take some time and there will be some mistakes which up the pain level such as wax too warm/thin or waiting too long to pull off.  You&#x27;ll be tired of messing with it before you finish and the top and center are the harder and more painful areas.  The worst are when you can&#x27;t end your wax strip in a hairless spot and don&#x27;t have a good &amp;#34;tab&amp;#34; to pull with because you can&#x27;t get enough of the wax up to get a grip without pulling on the hair its attached to.  I wish I had read more of the reviews before starting, I think the tips about putting a piece of hard wax on top to act as a pull tab will help a lot.  If you&#x27;ve never had a wax, get a professional to do the first one.  The first one hurts the most and its easier to let someone else inflict the pain rather than do it yourself.  You&#x27;ll also learn a lot about how it should be done.  My waxer is great and I can be in and out in less than a half hour and no discomfort once she&#x27;s done.bout how it should be done.  My waxer is great and I can be in and out in less than a half hour and no discomfort once she&#x27;s done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seriously surprised by how great this wax works I was reading some of the reviews here n they definitely helped so I recommend reading a couple before you go on the painful Brazilian expericiene. I have been going to the salon to get Brazilian waxed a couple of times but it was too expensive n decided to give waxing at home a try.. First I laid a towel on the floor I had a plastic bag to put the wax strips after and played some music (for encouragement) the wax was great I&#x27;m pretty tolerant to pain but I was so scared of pulling the strip I reccomed not thinking bout it n going for it because it will be so much easier n less painful than just sitting there pulling slowly n hurting. I will be buying a numbing cream next time even it it doesn&#x27;t take all the pain away it will make it a little better! Happy waxing girls!</li>
    <li> There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about this product. Great packaging, great instructions, everything was wonderful. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> This wax warmer does what the one I returned was suppose to do, same brand more basic model. The other model that came with the Brazilian wax didn&#x27;t even put a dent in the wax after setting for 8 or9 hours, didnt even soften the wax. I returned it to my local store and purchased this kit with a better warmer for the same price,and got the extras that would have cost me maybe another $30.00 locally.</li>
    <li> The kit included every possible component necessary, and the wax never gets too hot. Easy to use and creates a perfect wax job.</li>
    <li> This kit is AMAZING. I have had several Brazilian waxes, all different experiences. The worst part was always someone that took entirely too long to finish the process, and of course the cost about $60 every six weeks. This product is easy to use and not as painful as one would expect. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS...WATCH THE VIDEO prior to using this product. I am extremely satisfied with the results (the hair also grows back a lot slower with this product for some reason). I used a little bit of coconut oil on my hands prior to doing the wax so that I would not mess up my manicure as this process does get somewhat messy. I have already recommended this product to approximately ten women who are all equally satisfied. THIS PRODUCT IS A MUST BUY!</li>
    <li> Very good kit for the price, and it&#x27;s worked fine with no issues. Used it over a dozen times now and have no complaints to report. It heats up quickly and is fairly easy to clean up and put away.</li>
    <li> the warmer its self is good. the stuff it came with...not so much. so messy. but thats not the products fault. works well on legs and arms. but sadly not so well on the crevices like the bikini area and underarms. ive since went back to shaving</li>
    <li> Seems okay so far. I&#x27;ve used it once very extensively all over the face, lips, chin area. Doesn&#x27;t remove everything, even though the hairs might be long. I found that sometimes the hair seems ripped out in the middle instead of by the root. Bliss Poetic Waxing Kit is the one I used to use before they changed the packaging and upped the price. It&#x27;s been about two weeks and after using it on the chin area I broke out a lot, and around the side of the face and lip area. Not sure if I&#x27;m allergic to the wax or the skin is super sensitive to it. The Bliss one didn&#x27;t irritate my skin the same way but will have to keep trying to see if this irritates me again.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and came in excellent condition.  I tried the product as instructed through the CD + manual and this product works exactly as it says it does.  There as no pain in the outer regions and split second moments of pain in the inner regions.  It took two hours without any mess, as long as you follow the instructions and prepare your area properly.  I also read reviews on this product before purchasing it and there are many helpful tips such as taking a warm shower before waxing.  The shower helps cleanse the area and softens the skin and the heat from the warm shower opens the pores; this significantly reduces the level of pain you might experience.  I also watched other at-home Brazilian wax videos which helped with knowing where to place the wax and the amount as well as the technique and angle.  To be more precise, the level of pain for the inner region is similar to taking off a stubborn band-aid; the pain is instantaneous and fades into numbness after a few seconds of applied pressure.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product, the results are worth it! (:  If you have any questions, feel free to comment.</li>
    <li> works great on course hair just do small strips</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! The best wax kit I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Love it! It really allows you not to shave for over a month or so&#x27;</li>
    <li> I love this kit! It has everything you need and is extremely easy to use. I use this wax for my bikini area as well as my brows. I&#x27;d never tried hard wax before, but now I wonder why I didn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s so much easier on your skin. I could wax my brows and walk right out of my house without any red puffy skin. If you&#x27;ve never used hard wax or have never waxed your bikini area, this product has very good instructions. The directions on how to apply the oil and how to heat the wax are extremely important, so pay close attention to those. If you put too much oil on, you will miss a lot of hairs. As for the heating of the wax, not following instructions can lead to burns, so beware. It&#x27;s a long process, but worth it, so I usually begin to warm the wax a few hours before I need it, that way it can fully melt and then be turned down to reach a comfortable waxing temperature. I found the video included quite useful as a first time bikini waxer, and was able to avoid any horror stories I&#x27;ve heard over the years. I&#x27;ve only used this product twice, each time to do a full bikini area wax, and my brows, and it looks like I&#x27;ve hardly used any wax. I&#x27;m expecting to get about 15-20 waxings out of this kit.</li>
    <li> awesome product! the oil helped a lot!! much cheaper than getting a brazillian done once a month :-) can use it on eye brows and arm pitt area. would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> greatest thing EVER if you have been shaving your bikini area and are tired of bumps and stubble.  This is easy to use, hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin and does the job just right.  I am very happy.</li>
    <li> After spending $90 to get my legs waxed, I decided it was time to try and do it at home.  I haven&#x27;t tried to do the dreaded bikini line yet, but so far this kit it perfect.  I recommend reading the directions, as well as doing some Googling.  There is a lot of great advice out there for beginners.  My advice?  Do not expect to be perfect the first time.  You may miss some spots, but it will get easier.  Your hair will grow back slower than any other method, and it will start to thin out.  If you are using hard wax, do not wait too long to yank it off.  It will get too dry and brittle.    Perfect kit.  Absolutely no complaints!</li>
    <li> Not clean well,just clean 70-80% every single wax,when it stick on your finger hard to clean and feeling sticky .</li>
    <li> Well worth the money! Use old pillowcases as strips if you would like as this kit is more for the bikini waxing and works as its own strip!</li>
    <li> Very allergic to one of the products, don&#x27;t know which one.  Don&#x27;t want to repeat the process to find out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one time so far. its a LOT of work but worth it. I&#x27;m sure that if I use it every few weeks that it will become easier. I tried using it for my eyebrows as well, it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one sitting, for a full bikni wax, I used about half of the wax. Just FYI</li>
    <li> I was so damn happy when the box arrived. The plastic thing that was holding the Dvd was broken. But who cares. I freaking love it the kit. Idk what else to say. lol</li>
    <li> Nice wax  warmer. Cheaper even after delivery  than going to the my local store. If only I could bend certain way certain ways.... :-p</li>
    <li> Excellent! Easiest waxing kit I&#x27;ve ever used. Of course it&#x27;s painful but with the right prep work, this wax is definitely great for an at-home wax! Grabs hairs great. The pre-epilation oil is a must! Does not come with wax remover, but I just use a little coconut oil and any wax residue comes right off. Cooling gel feels great! Wish it came with more wax warmer collars but you can buy them pretty cheaply elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The first few times I used it I cried and it was a nightmare and a mess. I had irritation bumps and wax on my skin for a week. After a few times of using this product I found better techniques and know how to spread the wax properly without adding too much or too little. The more you use it the faster you&#x27;ll learn and the less irritation bumps you&#x27;ll get.</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought one for my daughter and ended up buying a second one for myself. Works for large or small areas. Not messy like the microwave style with cloths. Like that there are no cloths. Way easier to clean up.</li>
    <li> Lid came broken ordered a replacement lid came broken too. Gave up tossed them both</li>
    <li> Great at at home kit.</li>
    <li> If you are a DIY kind of waxer, this is perfect for you! I use mind all the time. In fact, I am running out of things to wax - I am OBSESSED!</li>
    <li> Having always been too shy to visit the salon, this is my only method of getting a Brazilian wax.  I was happy to read so many positive reviews on this product before purchasing, and am also happy to give my own praises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Start the warmer on high, but as soon as the wax has a 0.25&amp;#34; ring of melted wax around it, flip the remainder unmelted wax, and turn the warmer down to low.  The residual heat will continue melting the wax, and you won&#x27;t burn yourself with scorching hot wax.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Apply a generous amount.  Not only is it easier to grab onto to remove, but for some reason, it also cools more reliably and doesn&#x27;t flake off like some thinner layers do.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Definitely watch the DVD that comes with the kit and do your research online - you do NOT want to attempt a home wax without advice.</li>
    <li> Great product, today I received my order and used it. Under arm waxing was so easy and wasn&#x27;t any pain. I really happy with buying this product i saved a lot of time and money doing wax at home)) I recommend to other customers and my friends for buying this kit...😊😊😊😊😊</li>
    <li> I have found it very easy to use and it works quite well.</li>
    <li> first time waxing, I did my armpits. I think this wax works very well for coarse hair. I did it on my legs and arms and made a huge mess and the wax kept sticking to my skin and refused to be removed even with baby oil. It failed at pulling hair out. It works well for my arm pits, and the pain is not that bad after the first time, and this is coming from a person with a medium pain tolerance. I did a little of bikini and I gave up, it really really hurts! haha, but I would suggest this kit to any beginner waxers. I haven&#x27;t even gone to a professional before, so this works well for starters. Use a towel to sit on or cover you, no matter how much you think you won&#x27;t make a mess (like I did), you will make a mess!</li>
    <li> Just got my shipment and was damaged</li>
    <li> I used mine for a full body wax and it has been the best wax I&#x27;ve used thus far and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit for newbies.. I loved it so much, and so did my friend that I passed it on to her once I was finished!</li>
    <li> This was my first time waxing so I was a little scared to try it, but this kit made everything SO much easier! It came with an instructional DVD that explains the procedure with a lot of detail. It was so easy! I definitely recommend it to any other beginners!</li>
    <li> Product works great, much easier than microwave formulas. When I received it though the warmer looked like it had been used before. I thoruoghly cleaned everything before using to make sure. THe wax was new and unopened.</li>
    <li> Great set up! This is so much more convenient than microwaving and having the wax get too cold by the time you are half finished. I just plug this in on Medium when I am getting into the shower, and it&#x27;s ready to go when I get out. Then I switch to low while I am dipping. It stays at a nice constant temp and consistency. You can use the high setting to melt the wax faster, but be careful of application because it will get extremely hot and runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because I hated the wax it came with (I MUCH prefer Gigi&#x27;s All Purpose Honee) but that was an easy change to make. If you wax at home, I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I like it much better than the Sally Hansen wax strips.  It says to keep on all day but I am able to use it after a few hours on low.  So glad I bought this!!</li>
    <li> Every time I wax my face, a lot of my doesn&#x27;t get waxed. However the microwaveable version of this brand is amazing</li>
    <li> like it makes my legs silky smooth</li>
    <li> This wax is amazing. The kit comes with everything needed for a less painful waxing experience.</li>
    <li> This machine and the deal is great, the price is great, the quality is great, however after watching the seemingly easy video on waxing I tried waxing myself and it was the worst experience ever. The wax is EXETREMLY messy sticks to everything and dries hard and hard to clean up. It drops every where, when I was waxing my body the wax was coming off in tiny pieces and made it almost impossible to remove. After reapplying and doing it over and over again I because so tired it took me 3 hours to finish. 3 hours I&#x27;m not joking. They needed to include the paper to remove the wax and not say it can peel off easily with the hand that is some BS I was so upset it took up all my time, wax was stuck all over my bathroom I was mentally and physically exhausted. I would rather pay for a professional to do it then deal with that crap again. Words of advice use a waxing cloth if you buy this.</li>
    <li> Messy, I don&#x27;t have the patience for this.</li>
    <li> WAX GETS HARD ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WITH VERY LITTLE TIME TO APPLY.ALSO DIRECTIONS SAYS THAT THE WAX MELTS IN ABOUT A HALF HOUR WHEN IT TAKES ALMOST AN HOUR.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM</li>
    <li> My wife had some hair pulled at the salon and really liked the hard wax they used. She did some research and I ended up buying this for her. She really loves using it. The heat is just right and you don&#x27;t need strips or anything. The wax just dries and you pull the wax off. I wish I could tell you that it&#x27;s painless, but as any device for hair pulling, it&#x27;s gonna hurt like hell, but it gets everything and is easier to use than other wax products that you have to stick in the microwave and end up burning yourself. The bowl keeps the wax at just the right heat until you are done using it. The you cap it and use it next time.</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and I love trying, different waxing companies, and sense this one had such great reviews I ordered 2 waxing kits, one of them came with a shattered lid, very disappointed I can not put this wax pot in my spa with no lid</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to paying a professional to wax, but was getting to expensive! This product was well worth the money. The hard wax was much easier to use then the regular with strips. I also have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritate! You won&#x27;t be disappointed,</li>
    <li> I wax myself, because frankly, I hate spending $75 to go to the salon, for something I can do myself.  This kit is just what the professionals use.  Just follow the directions, and the process gets easier each time you do it.</li>
    <li> Have had this for about 8 months now I think, and I love it. I ended up buying the muslin roll and chocolate wax too and have ended up using the chocolate wax with muslin more than the hard wax, but I like them both. The warmer is great, much better than using microwave or drugstore box brands. Totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> It was what I expected :)</li>
    <li> No direction on how to use the kit. so if you never used a waxing system before you will be completely lost.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and just as advertised! Being that I&#x27;m a newbie doing this myself, it got a little messy. It&#x27;ll be fine once I get the hang of it though. However, I do wish there was some wax remover included in the kit. Still worth the investment though. Highly recommended! 😊</li>
    <li> So, I was worried about getting this because I actually first purchased the microwavable little green hard wax from Sally Beauty, but this is LOADS better. It actually gets MORE hair out than the green stuff and honestly, it is so easy to use with the warmer. I HIGHLY recommend, if you, like myself have torn up your skin with hard wax. I DESPISE that stuff, it actually made my skin peel. This HARD wax is amazing, no strips, easy cleanup and it gets the job done in under 15 minutes! I will do this forever!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SET.    My husband has a random patch of VERY coarse hair on his back that irritates him (the hairs snag in his polo shirts). After years of plucking them by hand, well tweezers, I had enough. I vividly remember my own traumatizing experience with strip wax where I was the guinea pig for my older sisters who wanted to wax their own legs but somehow convinced me to try it first because I was young and hadn&#x27;t started shaving my legs yet... (kinda funny now that I think about it, but traumatizing all the same... wax everywhere - strips not adhering right) Any way, I figured I would seek a hard wax for my husband. After all, I get my eyebrows waxed all the time and LOVE how there are no strips involved. Plus, I knew I had to make this experience good for my husband otherwise he wouldn&#x27;t let me do it again. If I was successful with the wax, it really meant less work for me plucking every hair by tweezers. Success right?    So, seeking a hard wax, I stumbled upon this kit. Never using hard wax before and trying hard to forget my own reservations, I ordered it. When it arrived, the first thing I did was watch the video (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED). Please note that the video features a Brazilian wax in action (yeah, duh, should have known being I bought a Brazilian wax kit - didn&#x27;t register that is what I&#x27;d actually see). So make sure you watch it around 18 and older, or hide in your closet far far away from people so they don&#x27;t think you are watching something naughty. Of course the closet hiding might suggest that anyway...  Just don&#x27;t be like me where I popped it in the DVD player in the living room to be greeted by a woman in all her glory on the big screen with hot wax being applied. I barely got it turned off in time before my mother-in-law (who was visiting) came around the corner. Whew - close one. That aside, I did finish the video which was educational for a hard wax beginner like me. It got me through my first wax and we&#x27;ve been using it every since.Make sure you use the Pre-Epilation Oil before the wax and the cooling gel afterward. It really does help. I&#x27;ve noticed when we use the oil, my husband doesn&#x27;t seem to bleed as much (I&#x27;m not saying gushing blood or rush for bandaids - no. But you&#x27;ll have little pin pricks at time where the follicle comes out of the skin and the skin is trying to adjust. And some blood might surface to the top. Very normal. I&#x27;m not mean, I&#x27;m helpful). The cooling gel really is my husband&#x27;s favorite part because, well, it cools the skin down after the trauma of having its hair forcefully removed and it is his light at the end of the tunnel that the torture is over.    Highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> Maybe this is supposed to be used in one sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this and it worked great. I let the wax cool and used it again a week later, and the wax didn&#x27;t work nearly as well. It flaked off instead of coming off in one peel. The third time I used it, the wax was almost un-useable. This makes me believe it is meant to be used when heated one time and not heated and then cooled and reheated again.</li>
    <li> Great kit. It&#x27;s made me a convert to waxing because it makes it so easy.</li>
    <li> I grew out my hair everywhere, in the middle of summer, used pre waxing oil, and had a hard time removing hair. maybe 1/3 of the hair was removed for each strip I applied. It worked well in between free waxes at the salon, but not when I grew it all out and tried to remove hair. Probably my mistake using it in other places instead of just brazilian. the wax didn&#x27;t want to remove my hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used mine but the reason I got this was because one of my three older sisters has one and we all keep using hers! Such a great product love it!! I have sensitive skin and break out on my upper lip but not with this stuff its amazing. BUY IT don&#x27;t look for anything else:)</li>
    <li> Fabulous starting kit. The hard wax it comes with not so great it&#x27;s to harsh. The Gigi coffee wax is the best</li>
    <li> great product.; works great . great price.everyone can fit into their budget. thanks.</li>
    <li> Sure I cried the first time I used it but it&#x27;s worth the pain. The second time I used it, it didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad. It comes with everything you need. I suggest taking a few Advil at least 30 minutes before you start. Getting the right temp and consistency is tricky but you get better with use. Practice makes perfect.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this waxing kit. It&#x27;s the same one the salons use when to wax my eyebrows and now I can do it in the comfort of my own home! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who waxes.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t take more than 10 times using this machine till wax heater is not working anymore</li>
    <li> doesnt work well tweezing is faster</li>
    <li> Good wax kit, but it does NOT come with strips, as I assumed.  It&#x27;s a hard wax kit, meant to just pull wax off in strips of itself.</li>
    <li> Okay so I have never had a Brazilian wax before... I&#x27;m honestly too shy to let someone do it for me.. &amp; too cheap I suppose. So I decided to get this. I watched YouTube tutorials so I wouldn&#x27;t screw it up.  My first testing area was under my arms... Came off smoothly and hardly hurt. Every hair was pulled, leaving nothing but smooth skin behind. I moved on to my bikini area... Wow, it works but hurts like a mother. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to hurt like hell no matter what you use but it was kind of unbearable in certain areas. I had to take a little break and start again later. I recommend taking some Aleve and using pain relief wipes before doing this. And definitely use powder over and over becsuse if your skin gets moist at all the wax does not peel off smoothly, it comes off in gooey chunks.. Not pleasant. Anyways, it&#x27;s going to be trial and error if you&#x27;ve never done this before, I certainly still have a lot to learn but it&#x27;s a great product itself and I am very happy I bought it!</li>
    <li> I love it and when you pull the wax off it doesn&#x27;t even hurt</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this waxing kit for over a year &amp; I still love it! It&#x27;s easy to use, simple to store &amp; helps me save a few bucks a year with at home waxing. Comes with an instructions CD that would really help out any beginner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. You don&#x27;t have to wait too long for it to have the weax melt. It came in good conditions. Nothing was chipped in the shipping process, and either  the oil split.</li>
    <li> Great product, like another reviewer said A GREAT TRICK is to put some older wax on the wax that you&#x27;re laying down to use as a pull tab to get a good grip and not have to do the painful flicking to get a corner to grab.  Make sure to go light on the pre-epliation (baby) oil or you&#x27;ll end up missing quite a bit.  For me the warmer was up a bit too high, even on low, so I end up turning it on and off as I wax.</li>
    <li> I wish I had purchased this 10 years ago. It is so easy to wax myself and gets easier each time I do it.  The warmer heats up the wax quickly and the Gigi hard wax does an excellent job. Comes with everything you need to Brazilian wax at home. I am very pleased. The first time hurt the worst. After doing it several times it doesn&#x27;t hurt much anymore. Be sure the wax isn&#x27;t too cool or too hot, be sure to pull the skin taught, apply in the direction of the growth and pull in the opposite direction of growth, and go slow.  It isn&#x27;t as bad as you might think.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the warmer alone, everything else is a perk for the price.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that this seller is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever been in contact wth about anything. Honestly! I had an issue with my kit ( personal preference nothing with the kit itself ) and Pradeep provided exceptional service and I&#x27;m truly in awh of it. Thank you! I think me telling everyone doesn&#x27;t even do justice of how happy I am with your customer service !&lt;br /&gt;The product is exactly as described if you are comfortable with doing this yourself- get this kit you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought I can make this product work for me. But after two painful attempts, I decided I hated this product. Let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;The product in itself is good, and I think Amazon offers a good deal considering how many items you get for the price (it&#x27;s good value). However, I felt like this product can only work for people who are really experienced with wax. I&#x27;ve never waxed before and I found this whole process to be way too time-consuming and not very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives:&lt;br /&gt;-The price is good&lt;br /&gt;-The value is good&lt;br /&gt;-If you&#x27;re experienced with wax, this would work well for you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives:&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely time-consuming&lt;br /&gt;-Messy&lt;br /&gt;-Will ruin your bathroom floor and your manicure unless you put towels all over the floors and wear a pair of gloves&lt;br /&gt;-Painful, irritates the skin&lt;br /&gt;-Hurt my back really badly -- I had to sit on the floor leaning forward and my back was killing me afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I also need to let other people know about one mistake I made, It&#x27;s IMPORTANT that your heat your wax to a right temperature. Notice how the instructions say you need to warm the wax on high setting for 20-30 minutes first and then leave it on the low setting for a while. Don&#x27;t ignore this instruction. When I tried waxing first time, I followed the instruction, and my wax had the perfect consistency. It was relatively easy to apply to skin and it wasn&#x27;t dripping everywhere. It was just right. The second time I made a mistake of leaving the wax on high setting, and then on medium setting. As a result, the wax was too hot and drippy. It was hard to apply to skin and it was dripping everywhere. Make sure your temperature is right, so your wax can have the correct consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, even after realizing the mistake I have made, I was sick enough of dealing with this whole process I decided it just wasn&#x27;t worth the time and the effort. You see, the pain issue is not that important to me, I can tough it up when I really want to. However, the time and the effectiveness of a product are important to me. I refuse to spend three hours on waxing one area. It&#x27;s absurd. I have ordered an epilator instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;WARNING!!! I put the towels, which I used to protect the bathroom floor from wax, in the dryer after I washed them. The wax got all over my dryer. It comes off but it takes long time to clean up. Use disposable towels or plastic sheet to protect your bathroom floors. This wax gets everywhere.iveness of a product are important to me. I refuse to spend three hours on waxing one area.

    <li> Overheated the wax, be very careful with this.</li>
    <li> Got this in and wow. Super impressed. The warmer warms like no problem. The wax is better than any wax I&#x27;ve ever used especially if you use the pre epilator oil first. I used less wax than I have with other products and was amazed at how this wax grabbed the hair. Then after using the post wax lotion made the burning sensation disappear! I will be buying these products again!</li>
    <li> Liquid out everywhere</li>
    <li> It melts the wax in 30 minutes, the oil that came with the kit caps got loose and makes it hard to handle. The cooling gel is very nice it has a cool mint like smell. I really enjoy this I&#x27;ve had it since the beginning of the summer I&#x27;m going to buy more hard wax to use this machine as I don&#x27;t like reusing the used wax strips until I find a good filter technique.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to get even if you only plan to do your eyebrows or mustache, the wax will last you longer than if you do everything and it will save you money in the long run, you can reuse hard wax if it doesn&#x27;t gross you out or if your hairs aren&#x27;t long and thick(you could still reuse if your hairs are long and thick wutevs).</li>
    <li> Best Purchase Ever *-*</li>
    <li> Just reserved my package and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> Very nice kit! I love hard wax, and am getting much better at the bikini area. It takes practice, but once you get the hang of it waxing is the way to go. This is the best wax I have tried.</li>
    <li> the wax is old, it doesn&#x27;t work.  It takes almost 2 hrs to have the wax fully melted and the wax does not stick to the waxing paper.</li>
    <li> I bought this set April 2013 and really haven&#x27;t used it till now. I have those really dark whiskers that come in and they are so hard to get rid of. So I decided that since I had this kit I might as well use it. And let me tell you it works. Just make sure you have the GiGi Epilating Lotions pre pack or the bigger bottles if you prefer. Anyhow it works but it takes time so make sure you do it on a day where you have some time.</li>
    <li> The best waxing kit I have ever used. Save the money on having it professionally done and do it in the comforts of your own home. Worth it over and over!</li>
    <li> This kit really has everything you need. Make sure you read the directions, and if you&#x27;re doing this for the first time, do yourself a favor and watch some videos on how to do it properly. The pre-wax oil was great, though I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the cooling gel. It made the area burn. I applied my old time favorite Bag Balm to my bikini area for a few days as a precaution and everything was fine. The wax itself is very easy to use. I laughed at the picture where the girl had wax all over her fingers. I&#x27;m honestly not sure how that happens. This was my first time doing this and it was pretty simple. Just warm up the wax at max temp for about 25 minutes, and then turn to the lowest setting and let it cool for another 5-10 minutes. This leaves the wax at just the right consistency so it&#x27;s not too runny that it will drip all over and it&#x27;s not too thick that you will have trouble applying it due to it being too sticky. Make sure you also put the collar on the wax can before you put it in the warmer. It will prevent little drips from getting all over the warmer and can be reused as many times as you like. You also get plenty of applicators. I only used two throughout, and only had to replace the first one because I set it down for too long and it hardened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried at first that this unit would be a hazard for the little ones, and while it should never be left unattended with children around, I felt comfortable getting ready in the bathroom with them around because the unit is not hot to the touch. It gets pretty warm, but not warm enough to cause injury by any means. You just need to be vigilant that little hands don&#x27;t go exploring. It also took some time to cool, during which I just locked the bathroom door for the 10-15 minutes before I cleaned it up. Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased with the results (a week later I still have clean, smooth under arms with no shadow of stubble at all and my bikini area is also smooth with no irritation that shaving always causes) and it was really very simple to use. For someone who has never done anything like this, it went very well with no mishaps. Just make sure you test your skin before starting. I had no adverse reactions and I have very sensitive skin, but you never know. Also, be very careful using this on areas with &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; skin, such as on stretch marks, breasts, etc. I didn&#x27;t try, but this was one big no-no I heard repeatedly.and it was really very simple to use.

    <li> Great product!  Wax works better than any I have tried.  But the lid was broken when I received it. The only problem I had!</li>
    <li> Well worth the money! I am newbie at waxing and I bought this kit mainly for my underarms. I was never completely blessed with the &amp;#34;hairless gene&amp;#34; and I after several years of constantly having to shave my armpit hair, I decided to give this waxing kit a try and I am so happy I did. Trust me, this stuff is super easy to use and it even comes with an instructional dvd that will give you really good pointers for waxing. I got tired of having to shave my underarms almost everyday and this gigi brazilian waxing kit is a gift from the hairless fairy. Waxing your armpits with this kit gives me beautiful hairless armpits for almost 3 weeks. I have tried waxing my legs with this and my legs was hairless for almost 5 weeks. I just have to warn you though that if you are waxing your underarms for the first time, it will be painful so take a tylenol/advil/etc. if you have a low tolerance to pain. As for leg hairs, its really painless almost similar to band-aid being removed from your skin. One last tip, proper disinfecting is super important because waxing open up your pores so you really need to buy an oil/lotion with disinfecting properties like tea tree oil or lavender oil. I bought an organic tea tree oil and it works great. Bottom line, Yes I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never waxed anything before so I did tons of research and watched at least a dozen videos on how to do it when I came across this kit. I struggled between this one and the Pro kit but found this one to be more of what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax comes&lt;br /&gt;-with the DVD (I thought everyone else reviewing here was just exaggerating when they said it was graphic but dear lord the first thing I see is a vagina),&lt;br /&gt;-a 14 oz can of hard wax (you DO NOT need strips with this. it hardens and becomes a strip itself which I found so incredibly awesome),&lt;br /&gt;-two little bottles of product,&lt;br /&gt;-a lovely wax warmer,&lt;br /&gt;-one clean collar to put around your can of wax for easy clean up,&lt;br /&gt;- and three different sizes of applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard wax is definitely my go to type because I like the thought of saving money not having to buy rolls of muslin. The only thing that I wasn&#x27;t happy with was that the two bottles of product leaked all over everything. The good news is that everything is wrapped securely in plastic so nothing got on the wax, dvd, applicators, or warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I recommend going out and buying before you wax any body parts:&lt;br /&gt;-baby powder (keeps the wax from sticking to skin. I hated the pre-epilation oil. Really not a fan of oils in general)&lt;br /&gt;-Some clean collars for your warmer (the kit comes with one but if it gets messy quickly then you&#x27;ll need more)&lt;br /&gt;-possibly a trimmer (if you are braving anywhere below the belt and your hair is too long a trimmer is a godsend. I ran out and bought a $10 razor/trimmer)&lt;br /&gt;-Popsicle sticks. The kit comes with different sizes but they&#x27;re angled and I found that having some round sticks improves my application.&lt;br /&gt;-Aloe Vera. After you wax the area is tender and needs to be soothed. I use aloe vera often so I always have some on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only waxed my upper lip, between my eyebrows, and my arms. I never had any problem with messes or anything like that. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with pain either. (take some pain killers 30 minutes before you wax if you&#x27;re worried)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;-I heated the wax on high for about an hour until it becomes very very runny. Then I set it to low or about 20 minutes to half an hour so that the consistency is like a glue. Check the temperature on your wrist to make sure it&#x27;s comfortable for you. I like my wax warm but not excruciatingly hot.&lt;br /&gt;-Apply thinly. You can always add more layers if the wax is too brittle.&lt;br /&gt;-If wax gets stuck on nails, hair, or skin use baby oil, vegetable oil, or olive oil to gently rub it away. Key word: GENTLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish you the best of luck and hope this review helps!any problem with pain either.

    <li> Used this the day after It arrived. Waxed my armpits! Fairly easy. I watched the DVD witch explains alot of the issues previous customers have had. Common sense dictates to watch the DVD if you have no prior knowledge or experience. I watched it twice. It did help! I did my pits, and tried to do the back of my thigh. This is where i noticed that the wax consistency is crucial to a perfect wax. Num 1: trim!! If you dont it will hurt like a M.F. Num 2: one you eat up the wax and its all &amp;#34;liquified&amp;#34; (extremely thin consistency) turn it off and wait about 10 minutes. The wax should begin to solidify a bit, thicker consistency. This makes a big difference. Trust me i learned it the hadd way. I put a thin coating of wax on my leg and i couldnt get it off. The worst part is that it was on the fatty tissue, so it hurt! :&#x27;( well at least i suffered and i can pass on my experience unto you.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I was a little scared to do a brazillian on my own but it was easier than I thought.  The wax is a little messy but that was probably me and my lack of experience. I am so glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> I used to shave but hated the stubble and razor burn! I bought this because I wanted to start waxing instead and this kit had some pretty good reviews. It actually wasn&#x27;t that hard, though it did take me over an hour to do. But I think as I get better at the technique it will get faster. For me, the wax took about 30 seconds to a minute to get hard enough to pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was that the wax seemed to take a while to heat up. The center of the wax certainly took its time to melt! (maybe because it was a brand new jar of wax?) And it was also a lot more stickier than I imagined afterwards. For like a day I kept pulling off bits of wax, lol. These are very minor issues though and what I might expect with any kind of wax. However, the wax warmer keeps it at the PERFECT temperature. No running back and forth to the microwave or burning yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And pain? Sure, it hurts. It&#x27;s waxing. But I once tried waxing with that cheap Nair stuff and the strips, and that was a mistake! (I didn&#x27;t really know what I was doing...) I couldn&#x27;t even finish the job it hurt so bad. It definitely did not hurt as bad as that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it and am pleased with my purchase! I&#x27;m too embarrassed to go get this done by a professional and not only was I able to do it myself, it was much cheaper too!</li>
    <li> Good ebough for Brazilian Beginer. The DVD was funny, but instruction was good.</li>
    <li> Works as intended I&#x27;m sure, but owe! How people use things like this on any kind of regular basis is beyond me</li>
    <li> This item is great! not enough room to sing its praise! Works great, not too messy, CHEAP, money saver, and painless! The wax smells like honey (I don&#x27;t like the smell of honey but its faint) so your home won&#x27;t smell like a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried almost every strip wax product from nads to bss brands and they ALWAYS hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard wax is the way to go, especially for sensitive areas like under arm and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit- don&#x27;t let the wax harden too much lol it will just snap off in pieces taking no hair with it. Doesn&#x27;t hurt, but a time waster lol. Still loving this. I&#x27;ve done my under arms (worked flawlessly), did my legs (learned not to let wax harden too much, and way more skin so takes longer, but don&#x27;t be scared to do bigger patches), this weekend I&#x27;ll do Ms. kitty and update on that.</li>
    <li> *Edit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wrote this review I was frustrated because the DVD that came with it used epilating strips.  The kit does not come with these. Another customer explained I did not need strips because this is hard wax.  I used the product yesterday with strips and without. It works great in terms of getting the job done without strips, so I am happy with the product. I did bleed a little from the hair follicle; however, this is probably due to my skill level and not the product. I would have given this five stars except for the ambiguous nature of the instructions (e.g. strips in dvd vs no strips). I am not an esthetician, so its already risky to do this sort of thing to myself and I would like to have a clearer picture of the product in terms of the instructional video. The paper instructions came in several languages and none of them were English... I pieced through the Spanish (not my native language). Other than that I gave myself a full Brazilian bikini wax at home with very little effort - it hurt and took a lot of time but it was totally worth it. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I agree with other people when they say if this product did not work for you you are doing it wrong. This product worked great for me once I got the hang of it. I think the next time I use it the process will go a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> Go to a salon. Might be good if you just want to do your face but does not work very well on legs and thighs. Very painful and slow process, professionals can at least make it quicker. I was crying after only a few strips, and getting a good grip is hard. Threw it out.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I would give it 5/5 stars, but the cover was cracked when it arrived..</li>
    <li> I think I prefer this waxing among all others so far</li>
    <li> Ive used this now 4 times on my wife in her sensitive areas , at first she said it hurt a lot could you imagine.&lt;br /&gt;Now after the 4th time there is less hair and I am more skilled. The only complaint is what everyone else says it take way longer to beat up than advertised advertised. My wife tried it on me i guess ill pass and be hairy.</li>
    <li> Love the set - I had never waxed myself before getting this warmer but after enduring too many cramped hands and crossed eyes trying to tweeze my brows (not to mention all the pain from shaving my bikini line week after week in the summer months) I sprung for the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DVD, while...explicit in its detail, was very helpful with the technique tips - and the reviews here that say to turn the unit on high for about 15 minutes to partially dissolve the wax and then lower it to low and flip the wax \\&quot;puck\\&quot; over are right on - if you leave it on high and try to start waxing, the wax is too hot for your skin and too thin to do an effective job. If you leave it on low it will take a good hour to dissolve all the wax. It should be a caramel-like consistency. When the wax doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;grab\\&quot; your finger when you tap it and feels slightly firm, it&#x27;s ready to pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever tweezed or had someone wax for you, you know it isn&#x27;t painless - but I&#x27;ll say that this is about as pain-free as waxing gets. I barely feel it on my eyebrows, and it&#x27;s bearable on my bikini line. I had a full Brazilian with the cloth strips once and it was the most painful experience of my young life - I wish I had known about hard wax back then. I&#x27;m still not hardcore enough (or perhaps my hair isn&#x27;t thin and sparse enough) to endure a full Brazilian with this thing, but that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the oil on my bikini line - it makes my face break out really bad. Haven&#x27;t really used the cooling gel - I&#x27;m too hardcore. (I jest, I&#x27;m really just too scatterbrained to remember it.) I mostly use the largest and smallest sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even brought it to work and did my coworker&#x27;s eyebrows - they are all so impressed with the economy of this thing that I&#x27;ve converted a few people who were regular salon-goers. For the price of one eyebrow waxing, you can get a full year&#x27;s worth of regular waxing out of this thing. My mom liked it so much I got one for her for the holidays. (Nothing says Merry Christmas like hair removal, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waxed brows about 15-20 times with this, done my bikini area 6 times, and I&#x27;m still barely 1/3 of the way through the wax. It&#x27;s a great value!</li>
    <li> I love this wax system I have saved so much money waxing now if I could only learn to do my own eyebrows.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this and is in love with it. She&#x27;s never waxed before, so was pretty nervous buying a product she&#x27;s never used. She likes it because it&#x27;s simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Plug it in to heat up the wax&lt;br /&gt;- Dip the stick in and blow on wax&lt;br /&gt;- Spread on area&lt;br /&gt;- Wait&lt;br /&gt;- Pull&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The video that comes with the product is also very helpful, especially since this was her first time ever!</li>
    <li> A great kit for in home use!!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Get this system if you need to save money. Just like the wax they have in the salons. Easy to use also. And quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This product is just what I have been looking for! I have very coarse hair so to be on the safe side I tried it under my armpit. I took off everything! Remember to apply the oil before and bear in mind that your skin will absorb some of it so you have to put enough to compensate especially if you are moving slowly. If your hair is as think as mine, do remember to apply pressure to the spot right after ripping off the wax... it really does help. After I got the hang of it I actually saved time by apply to more that one spot at a time. If you are going to do that a good idea is to apply to the middle of your armpit (side to side) with about a 1/2 inch strip. After you get that bit off you start removing from opposite sides of the spot at the same time. I apply to the middle first to ensure that I have a separation... hope you understand what I mean. I was not too concerned about the direction of hair growth, because I couldnt identify any one direction. Instead I ripped in the direction that was most ergonomic for me. Ensure the wax is not too hot, I wait until it stops dripping quickly and instead start to collect at the bottom of the stick. Don&#x27;t wait too long though because if cools too much it is difficult to apply because it starts pulling the hairs...ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to my nether- regions. This I attempted one week later. Ensure you watch the video first, it really helps. You will need a large mirror and a towel to sit on. I did it on my bed and used the pillows for back support. First ensure the hairs are the right length.. about 1/4&amp;#34; or 1/2cm and the same suggestion for the oil applies. Map out the general direction of hair growth ... at least to start out with. I would say start with the sides your bikini line or if the hair goes up to your belly button, start there. I suggest that because it starts to narrow the area. Ensure that when you apply the wax the end of the strip is on bare skin. If you end it in a patch of hair it will hurt a lot when it&#x27;stime to rip it off. If you decide to brave this section and require more info... just send me a message.</li>
    <li> I love this wax pot. I use it mostly for facial waxing but I have used it on my underarms and bikini area on occasion. The video shows you exactly have to do it and it really isn&#x27;t hard at all. I almost never go into the salon anymore. This pot has saved me a great deal of money.</li>
    <li> I was really worried Id buy this and then chicken out and never use it. The thought of giving myself a Brazilian wax was pretty daunting. But it was much easier than I thought - although it did still hurt!! Very professional kit and video. One drawback is that it takes about an hour to melt</li>
    <li> I bought this kit and I am very pleases with it. Def. a great deal. Product worked flawlessly. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I chose to buy this waxing set because I wanted to try bikini waxing on my own rather than going to a salon where the prices are high! I have had some experience waxing with strips but never a hard wax. I am now never going back to strips! If you are planning to do a full wax down there I would suggest going not trying that the first time. My first few times I just waxed the bikini line, don&#x27;t try to do the full wax until you feel you have fully mastered your technique. It does hurt at first, but the pain doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I also really like the creams that are included.</li>
    <li> Paying for a wax can get very expensive. That&#x27;s why I decided it may be a good idea to buy my own kit. I&#x27;m glad that I did. I watched the dvd and went to town! The wax did take a lot longer than I thought. (Instructions state 15-20 minutes but it&#x27;s really more like 60-75 minutes) I waxed both of my legs and bikini and I still have some wax left over. It&#x27;s a great buy but have some towels handy because it can get messy until you get the hang of it. I will continue to use this product and will recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I do like this, but maybe it&#x27;s something that i need to get used to. Hurt a lot, same as regular waxing, so that bit about it not being as painful is not true. Unless if maybe you put some baby powder down on the area before waxing. Over all, i do like it, i just need to use it slowly at a time.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice so far to give Brazilians to my wife.  Once you get the hang of it, it is quite simple to do.  Having never waxed anyone before, I watched the included video and plugged in the warmer.  I do think it took almost an hour on high before the wax was ready to use and then got started.  The oil that keeps the wax from sticking to the skin is key - applied with a cotton make-up round to the surrounding area.  I started off very slow and VERY nervous, but by halfway through, was doing pretty good.  It is hard to judge wax temp without touching it, but by talking to her and looking at how the way runs off the stick when dipping, you kind of learn to judge that better - runny is HOT and when it builds thicker on the stick when you twirl it - it&#x27;s about right.  It is not quick, especially the first time or two, but it isn&#x27;t bad if you plan for it.  The kit cost less than 1/2 the cost of 1 trip to the salon and our results are actually better - two waxes and I have used about 20-25% of the can.  Used much less on the second than the first time - we should easily get 8 or 10 waxes out of the can, I would think.Finding the right location and lighting is key to this - and someone you trust to give you the wax job.  I&#x27;m rating the kit and it&#x27;s effectiveness - not the ease of giving a wax to yourself.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so easy and effective;this kit definitely exceeded my expectations. The directions make it easy to follow safe and sterile procedure.</li>
    <li> This is for all of you out there that cannot drop 200 a month for leg waxing, threading, face waxing. If you are a beginner I recommend you to start with hard wax and as soon as you grasp a good technique start trying original hot wax. Believe me ladies you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple times and it works nice heating up the wax versus having to go to the microwave during the waxing process. It can over heat it so be sure to turn it to low before it melts all the way.</li>
    <li> This is awesome..I wax my own eye brows and legs with this. Great quality. I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the same system used in salons. I was a bit leary of waxing body parts but i found it easy, and little to no pain. Brazillian wax is so much thicker than the strip wax so you do use more wax, but it is effortless and makes removal very easy. I priced this unit @professional beauty supply stores and found by useing Amazon i saved over 50%. Wax refills are generally just under $20 in stores, amazon has the same thing for under $13. Highly recommend if you want a professional system. I used a coffee filter with a hole cut in the middle around the wax heater to avoid dripping. Wax is messy, so be prepared to clean up little messes while you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I used the Brazilian hard wax. The pot is stylish and works well with all the other items send with it. However I will not be buying the hard wax again. it is a very harsh wax and I cannot wait to get rid of it.  I am thinking of just dumping it and a different brand. Sorry, anything but this Brazilian hard wax!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this wax hoping to use it for all my waxing purposes. I haven&#x27;t tried a bikini wax yet but I have tried arms, legs, and underarms waxing. It works fantastically well for underarms. It did not leave a single hair and pulled the hair out from the root. It didn&#x27;t stick to my skin so it really didn&#x27;t hurt much. The places where it did NOT work were my legs and arms. The hairs on my arms and legs are finer (not peach-fuzz fine, but fine) so the wax didn&#x27;t seem to be able to grab on. A few hairs came off, but I did not ever achieve one clean spot. I tried applying the wax in the opposite direction, thinking the hairs would be lifted and the wax could cling on, but it still didn&#x27;t work - I guess the hairs were just too thin. The soft wax, MOOM, works for both my arms and legs much more effectively, with relatively little pain as well.</li>
    <li> I noticed that this is the exact unit that my professional and expensive waxer uses so I thought I would see if I could save a little money by doing it at home.  I&#x27;ve used it four times now.  The first two times went smashingly.  It hurt slightly more than at the spa but I suspect that it&#x27;s due to user inexperience and that I will just have to accept there will be a learning curve.  The third time I used it, the wax wasn&#x27;t removing the hair and after reading some Q&amp;As on their website, I figured out that I was spreading the wax on too thick.  More is not better!  I corrected my error and the fourth time went fine.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it:) arrived fast and just as described. Would recommend to others&lt;br /&gt;Used other wax kits and nothing has been this nice for the price</li>
    <li> This kit comes with everything you need. The burner works good and I will be buying GiGi products again. Good price</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous about ordering this kit, but after reading all of the reviews, I figured it was worth a shot.  Considering that I have never waxed before, it was not very difficult to use.  The DVD gives a pretty thorough explanation on the best way to use the product.  Also, the bikini wax was not as painful as I would have thought.  This wax works well on the underarms as well.  As a person who mainly shaved my underarms, the process of waxing was extremely painful moreso than the bikini area, so be warned.  This kit would be great for waxing any parts of the body. I even use it to shape up my husband&#x27;s mustache.  I also like the fact that it comes with a warmer instead of having to microwave it.  The warmer alone makes the kit worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this item. The only bad thing I do not like is having to wait for the container to melt to get a little scoop to do your lip. I know I can buy strips but I do not like them. I always have left over sticky and hair remaining. You do not have either with GG. It works well and I do not think it is as painful to use.</li>
    <li> I was very very hesitant to order this as, well..... I&#x27;d be so nervous to wax there... by myself! But for 1/3-1/2 the cost of a SINGLE professional wax, I&#x27;ve found this to be a VERY good investment!  Definitely watch the included DVD first - yes, it shows very &amp;#34;private&amp;#34; parts, but very helpful considering you&#x27;ll be doing that to yourself. Also, I would not skimp on the wooden sticks - maybe even buy extra ones of the thick kind since you really don&#x27;t want to double-dip - (germs in warm temp, no thanks!)  Make sure you&#x27;re in an area where you can easily clean up dripped wax, even lining the area with newspapers or something else disposable as wax does not &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; off. Very happy with this purchase! Did NOT rip my skin as I feared - just follow the directions :)</li>
    <li> I looked forward to using this product and dreaded it at the same time because I had never waxed before and figured it was going to hurt very badly.  The CD that comes with it is kind of useless but that doesn&#x27;t change the 5 star rating.  Waxing isn&#x27;t rocket science and if I can figure it out anyone can! The wax that comes with the warmer is in a pretty big can.  I have waxed twice and still have enough for at least 2-3 more waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things: make sure your hair is cut very short and pull the skin tight when you peel the wax.  Also, use both bottles of the pre and post wax products, they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this I had purchased an epilator that I promptly threw in the garbage because it was terribly painful! Using that was self-induced torture!!! The GiGi wax system is much better in terms of pain and once you get used to it, waxing doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the first time you do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will definitely continue using it!</li>
    <li> I bought the items in the kit separately at a Sally Beauty Supply, and the total cost was about $20 more, so Amazon has a great price on this kit!  I have never used hard wax before but decided to try it based ln internet research and the good reviews I read on Amazon.  I have never had a professional waxing done (it weirds me out), and I have a LOW pain tolerance, so I was very, very happy to discover that a) with this hard wax stuff, a home wax job is easy! and b) moderately painful at most.  I have tried DIY soft waxing, with the strips, and I recall that as being much FAR MORE PAINFUL than the hard wax.  Definitely read the directions.  Definitely try to apply the wax so you have a &#x27;pull tab&#x27; of wax..that&#x27;s what helps reduce the pain, in my experience thus far. (And by that I mean, I have used the wax once, but There is a definite difference in pain between &#x27;with pull tab&#x27; vs. &#x27;without pull tab.&#x27;). And plan at least an hour of prep before you start waxing..my brand new can of wax needed the full 45-minutes for the initiall melting at the &#x27;high&#x27; setting, with another 15minutes at the &#x27;low&#x27; setting to cool down enough to apply to my skin.  The collars are very useful, not just to keep the warmer clean, but also to have a &#x27;lip&#x27; to rest the applicator on.  I balanced the applicator so that the &#x27;used&#x27; end would hover over the melted wax and the &#x27;clean&#x27; end would rest on the collar.  Not hard to do at all.  I bought the after wax cooling gel and the wax remover stuff....honeslty, once I run out, I&#x27;ll probably just use aloe vera gel and olive oil, respectively.  I did use a damp washcloth after applying the &#x27;wax off&#x27; lotion to remove the residual wax. Worked ok.  As the wax continued to harden, I found that the rest came off in the shower.  I am not entirely convinced that the recommended &#x27;Pre Hon&#x27; cleaning stuff is a necessity, but since I bought I&#x27;ll finish the bottle.  My local Sally Beauty Supply didnot have the pre-epilation oil.  I&#x27;ll probably purchase that fromAmazon, as other reviewers said it does help reduce discomfort.  Prior to waxing, I showered and used a gentle scrub on the area to exfoliate.  I am very pleased by this product and I will definitely use it again!  My only complaint thus far, the odor is not noxious, but I&#x27;ll be happy when it dissipates.</li>
    <li> Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description. well worth the money, great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be plain - going to get waxed is a pain.  Between trying to get through on the phone line to schedule the appointment, find a time when you&#x27;re okay with going to pay somebody $75+ to rip hair from your body (that the ripper is available, as well), to driving to the salon, finding parking, waiting in a sterile waiting area, then trying to make small talk as your hoo-ha is on display, it&#x27;s not a completely pleasant experience.  The first time I used this kit, it took a bit.  I&#x27;d never waxed myself before, in any area, and wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to do.  I had watched the instructional video, but it didn&#x27;t cover how you were supposed to use your right arm to pull from the left side.  After about an hour and a half the first time, I was significantly less red and irritated than when going to the salon.  I didn&#x27;t need to wax again for about a month, and then it was easier as I was more experienced.  After the wax was heated up (my only complaint is the amount of time the wax takes to melt, but you&#x27;ll have that issue with any of the kits), the second, more thorough waxing really only took about half an hour.  I got to pick my music, relax in my bathroom, and take a break if I needed to.  This IS the only self-waxing kit I&#x27;ve owned, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  I can only compare it to the nightmare of a salon.  With 2 waxes down, I still have over half of the wax that came in this kit.  I&#x27;ll take the $30 waxing kit (via Amazon) and more relaxed atmosphere for 4-5 (or even more!) waxes over $80 plus tip for one wax and a hassle any day.</li>
    <li> This item is great quality. I absolutely love my Gigi wax. My items came right on time and was exactly described by seller. I recommend this product to anyone who are trying to give themselves or potential consumers Brazilian waxing. It is very convenient. I will be buying more wax in the near future!!!</li>
    <li> The machine works great, melt the wax on high and then maintain it on low. My order came with a cracked cover and I asked for a replacement, that came with an even worse cracked cover. Nothing life altering just annoying when buying a new product.</li>
    <li> This system takes some getting used to but is a good quality and works well. You can save yourself a lot of money after only one waxing.</li>
    <li> Great for Bikini waxing as well as legs and under arms too!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great easy kit to use, works well and saves me money.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that this was my first experience with waxing. I&#x27;ve normally been a eyebrow pluck and shave kind of girl but I was curious about this kit since waxing can be expensive in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took note of comments on here that if the wax gets too hot it will drip everywhere so when I heated up the wax I put it on high for 22 minutes and then on low and let it sit for a little while. Make sure to add the collar so the wax doesn&#x27;t drip on the device. It should be noted that this kit does not need strips as you just pull the wax right off (as a novice I didn&#x27;t know this and thought maybe the strips were missing from the kit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in terms of methods with the wax I found it the most effective to dip the sticks in there, scrape one side and then turn it a couple times to let it cool just a little bit before applying. The wax can get stringy like a glue gun which turning it helps get rid of that. You have to make sure you apply thick enough so it doesn&#x27;t tear apart when you rip and then to make sure you let it cool otherwise it will be sticky and won&#x27;t pull the hair properly. Although I did find that if you initially applied a section too thin you could apply a little more on top of it. Also, when you apply it helps to have a small amount of wax that doesn&#x27;t cover hair so that you can grab onto it to pull the strip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all if you have the right temperature and once you get the hang of it you really shouldn&#x27;t be dripping everywhere and it shouldn&#x27;t take 3 hours like other people have been saying. Just let the wax heat while you are doing something else and then go to town. I would say... if you are waxing the bikini area to make sure you give it a quick tough pull otherwise it will hurt like crazy. Just make sure you know the more hair you have down there the harder you should pull and the more painful its going to be. So if you have a.... uhhh... hairy animal going on you may want to shave unless you have good pain tolerance. I will say though that this wax does not pull on your skin which does help with the pain factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you watch the video that comes with it, be ready to stare straight in the face at a... you know.... a woman&#x27;s box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing, if you don&#x27;t want to wax the bikini this wax is very effective with other areas. I used it for underarm hair and it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK</li>
    <li> works great and easy to use</li>
    <li> The wax just not grab onto my hair (legs). I would pull it off after hardening but the hair would remain.</li>
    <li> Love the kit, I just don&#x27;t think I have the willpower to wax myself. Hurts A LOT. But I was expecting it! Wax can get messy but it melts well. The two little bottles of oil that come with it don&#x27;t do too much but work fine! Be careful not to overheat it or it becomes super liquid and you&#x27;ll have to wait for it to cool down to use it. I just would rather someone else rip out my hairs or better yet I got the Tria and have no hair at all!</li>
    <li> This is great! I bought this because I had been using a wax pot from Sally Hansen which has apparently stopped making wax refill kits, so I was a little worried about buying this kit. Mostly because I wanted to use it for facial waxing- eyebrows, chin, etc.- and the kit says &amp;#34;body wax&amp;#34;. I do tend to have sensitive skin but I still have to say this is a great buy. The wax pot is HUGE, so you can get a lot of use out of each refill. I personally didn&#x27;t much like the pre-epilator oil because it caused the wax to not stick to my skin well. I think it would help for waxing newbies who have trouble with the pain, but it caused the wax to not stick to skin or the hair well at all so I skipped the oil. It was actually really good for getting rid of extra wax residue after you&#x27;re done waxing, though! Definitely remember to turn the wax pot down to low once you&#x27;ve heated the wax to liquid and you&#x27;re ready to start waxing. Not because it&#x27;s too hot and will burn your skin, the wax was still alright to touch, but at that level of heat the wax is too runny to effectively do any waxing. Overall, a really great buy and a good value.</li>
    <li> While the products themselves are fantastic, the warmer is a bit touchy. I kept having to adjust the setting to keep the right consistency. The disc proved to be invaluable considering I had never waxed anything, or been waxed either!  It really went easier and faster than I figured it would after reading some of the reviews here.  I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m a waxer now not a shaver!</li>
    <li> I found the wax too hard to remove. Also it takes around 40 minutes for the wax to melt. That&#x27;s a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Great price and comes with everything you need - love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for years. Since my financial situation changed ( temporarily ) I had to cut back. I usually use the Gigi microwaveable wax. Since I am waxing my legs now. I decided that the microwaveable wax is sufficient. I just purchased the kit. I think it&#x27;s a great deal. I wax most parts of my body. It would cost me around $20-30 plus tip just for my legs. Elsewhere more. I save a lot of mola with the kit. Thank you Gigi</li>
    <li> I have spent hundreds- yes HUNDREDS of dollars on other wax products. None of them worked. They were messy, crackly, and ineffective. THIS wax is AMAZING. the temperature only gets hot enough to work PERFECTLY and won&#x27;t burn you. You just slap that sucker on with the handy applicator (with the hair grain of course) give it a second to cool. I usually tap my finger on the wax, when it stops sticking- your ready to rip that sucker off. And I must say, this wax is Soothing. Other waxes leave you yelping upon removal, but not this one! Quick and easy. So far I&#x27;ve used it on my eyebrows (yeah yeah not what&#x27;s it for, oh well- still works!) but I have NO DOUBT this will work just as well with AHEM other unmentionable places. I am soo excited that I bought this. Hello bikini season, goodbye hair. Thank goodness. I truly recommend this product. Yay!!</li>
    <li> If there were zero stars, I would give this product that rating.  WORST thing I ever bought on Amazon.  First of all, it is called a complete waxing kit but it doesn&#x27;t come with the strips you need to pull the wax off.  Second, even after i ordered the Gigi brand strips, it still doesn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t bother just buck up and pay a professional!</li>
    <li> I read a million reviews before deciding on this product. I tried it out as soon as it arrived and it works great.  It does take a little time to experiment with the best consistency and temperature, but once you get it-you&#x27;ll be on your way to a cheap, easy and hairless  experience.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS which leaves me with disgusting hair all over my face. I had used Avon skin so soft wax for the last few years and thought it was the best until I tried this. Super easy to heat and use. You don&#x27;t need the paper strips which cuts out alot of the mess and hassle with waxing.  And the pre wax lotion is a must! It makes the job a lot easier. So glad I found this!!</li>
    <li> love this!! i like that its a hard wax to where you dont need waxing strips. love it</li>
    <li> It does its job, and waxing is pretty painful, but at least the price doesn&#x27;t have to be if you do it yourself. Might want to go to a salon once to see how the pros do it, or just wing it like I did. Tough to tell if I&#x27;ll be doing it again, but maybe I&#x27;ll look for a good numbing cream or something. Yowza!</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made to date. Easy to use (even without the video...). Doesn&#x27;t come with strips, but they are cheap and easy to get. Pre/post wax solutions work great to relieve/prevent razor burn. The only reason I give it 4 stars is my unit&#x27;s on/off switch is faulty so I had to tape the lever to one side in order to get it to heat up. Had it 8 months and it still works, though!</li>
    <li> This is a high quality kit. Sadly my girlfriend couldn&#x27;t stand the pain of waxing and didn&#x27;t want to use it after the first try. Just make sure you&#x27;ve actually tried waxing before you buy this. I had to throw her away.</li>
    <li> Did not like at all... Used it once</li>
    <li> This hurts if you do not apply wax right, thick layers are best.</li>
    <li> Know the difference between hard wax and soft wax before you buy. You do not need muslin cloth strips for the hard wax. I didn&#x27;t realize this until after I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love this machine it comes with everything you need for waxing. This hard wax doesn&#x27;t require strips for the removal of the wax you just need to wait till it hardens and then just pull it off no need to put any kind of material to have it remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I wax my self and I was afraid of the pain since every time I have someone do it it&#x27;s pretty painful well after 2 months of thinking and building courage I went for it and to my surprise it didn&#x27;t hurt at all I was so amazed since I always hurt at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG hard wax doesn&#x27;t hurt and with one put it removed everything without ANY pain I will never go back to the salon and I wont ever use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a DVD with instructions and they show you step by step how to use everything. I regret waiting so long to use it but like I said I needed courage and I hope this will help you decide sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL NEVER GO TO THE SALON AGAIN!..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsito..</li>
    <li> This is a great buy! Save money doing it yourself at home. Salon quality. I use the Fantasea Wax strips with this</li>
    <li> Amazing product, easy to use, not sticky and pain free compared to the other waxing methods</li>
    <li> The warmer works well. Be careful when orderin the kit with the wax. I ordered gentle wax and received Brazilian hard wax, which is more complicated to use. Overall it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my daughter - she loves it - it&#x27;s got exactly the right amount of supplies for the price - she is planning to buy another when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my daughter for Christmas. The packaging looked good but when it was opened it was all broken up.  There were not waxing strips all the products that they say was included wasn&#x27;t.  I would not recommend buying this item.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product because of the reviews. Bad thing, both of the oil/gel bottles that come with this set were not sealed tightly and spilled all over the equipment. I haven&#x27;t plugged it in yet because I&#x27;m still cleaning the mess up. I&#x27;ll update when I get everything off and plugged in.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many wax kits, but this is by far the best...i&#x27;m in love!!! Definitely a product worth trying :)</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about a DIY kit for brazilian but I decided to try this after reading the extensive and at times,  humorous reviews.  I highly recommend this kit for anyone that has ever had a salon brazilion previously.  I think if you have some experience with how it feels and the results you will be better off!  I was thankful I took the chance as it  really is salon quality.  The warmer is absolutely key to the whole experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local wax salon is so over-booked, surprisingly.  They do a great job, but they are not flexible in scheduling and the prices keep increasing!  I can now do my wax in the privacy of my own home whenever I want.  I am pleased as other reviewers have stated that the wax will last for a while/multiple sessions.  Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it ladies (and gents) as this kit is amazing.</li>
    <li> It removes all unwanted hair, without mess and no need to use paper strips. I would buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> Gigi is a very fine product. It&#x27;s quite substantial in volume and more than I will use over time. It sits on my vanity in the bathroom and when I need it, I simply plug the little darling into the socket and wait for it to melt. i do watch it occasionally just for safety sake. I then lower the temperature and apply a couple of applications until I&#x27;m satisfied that I&#x27;ve removed all those little pesky hairs above my lip line. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. Most of them were more work and messy to deal with. Gigi is a dream. I find there is no mess. Foolishly, I purchased the extra collars. The question is: will I live long enough to use them all?. Suggestion: If you are a neat person, refrain from buying the extra collars -- at least for a while.</li>
    <li> I like this product alot. So easy to use and works really great.&lt;br /&gt;It really worth it with the price.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even need to go spa, paying 100$ each time &amp; don&#x27;t need to feel embarrassing  in front of other ppl.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone whoever needs.</li>
    <li> It was a great value for the price.  The instructions and DVD were helpful although I wasn&#x27;t really prepared to see someone&#x27;s &amp;#34;lady parts&amp;#34; in the DVD.  That&#x27;s really neither here nor there.  It&#x27;s an excellent product and worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say this.....It IS painful.....quite painful.....but only the first time.  The first time I used it was my first time having a bikini wax.  Subsequently I did it again about a month later and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as painful and I seemed to have &amp;#34;gotten the hang of it&amp;#34; by then.  I highly recommend it for someone who is paying to have it done.  It&#x27;s a great price and not too traumatic after you get it figured out.</li>
    <li> Thank u ...my daughter love it.</li>
    <li> Use it daily at work great product.</li>
    <li> Love this kit.    Not very many reviews from husbands waxing their wives, but here goes.  My wife was getting REALLY furry down south, and she agreed to do a Brazilian to spice things up.  No way in hell was she going to go to a salon, though, so it was DIY or nothing.  I couldn&#x27;t see her contorting herself for my pleasure, so I volunteered to do the deed.  After all, it&#x27;s my play area :).    I did a bit of research and watched a few YouTube videos, along with the video that came with the kit.  We set up on a towel on the bed and went to town.  I started with small strips first, then worked up to multiple, longer strips-- applying one, letting one cool, and ripping off the third. There was hardly any pain--except when I forgot to start a strip on a hairless area.  Now my wife has a really high pain tolerance, so I&#x27;m not recommending you do this if it&#x27;s your first time, and you&#x27;re really hairy down there. Some of the strips I pulled had HUNDREDS of hairs (with follicles attached!) on them.  Most of the stuff I read and saw recommended getting it done professionally first, then using the kit to do maintenance procedures on the fewer, finer hairs that regrow after a few weeks.    Tips:    Cooler wax is better than hot wax.  It should form a ball on the stick after spinning it a couple times.  If it runs off the stick, it&#x27;s too hot.  Apply the strip about the thickness of a nickel.    Pay attention to direction of hair growth. You ladies grow hair every which way down there.  Apply back and forth along and against the direction of growth, but yank against the direction of growth.  If you don&#x27;t pull against the direction of growth, you can end up with hair on the strip, but no follicles. You know what that means:  stubble in 48 hours. Oh, and be sure to pull the skin tight while applying the wax.    Pull the skin tight when yanking the strip, then press your hand on the area you just denuded.  The pressure reduces the pain a lot.    Biggie!  Make your strips start from an area of no hair.  This lets you easily pull up the end to get ready to yank without pulling hairs out in slow motion.  I almost got smacked for that one.  Try to leave a tag, or thicker spot on the end where you&#x27;ll be grabbing it.    We found that cornstarch worked better (less pain, more hair removed) than the pre-epilation oil.  YMMV.    Exfoliate and use some sort of growth inhibitor to minimize ingrown hairs.  We use Completely Bare Hair Growth Inhibitor, and have not had a single ingrown hair.    All in all, it took ~90 minutes to tame the beast.  I expect the next session will be half that, now that I have the hang of it.    Oh the hardest part for me?  Waiting 24 hours to play with my masterpiece ;).    ...and why on Earth didn&#x27;t we do this sooner?</li>
    <li> This is an awesome set for at home waxing. The best, most effective wax I&#x27;ve found. Warmer is perfect and adjustable , keeping wax at just the right consistency. Especially perfect for at home maintenance following a professional wax.</li>
    <li> Hurts more than other waxes.  I&#x27;ve not seen the point of the two liquids that come with it.  So far, no benefit to using them.</li>
    <li> I got this kit and have been using it for a month now. I have never got a professional Brazilian wax done which I would highly recommend prior to using this product. It is painful like hell when the wax is pulled off and if you have never experienced such pain, it&#x27;s unlikely you will go ahead with this for more than five minutes. Apply very small amount of wax towards the corner of the area where growth is least so that you don&#x27;t get stuck in a situation where you won&#x27;t be able to pull off the wax and the wax hardens and makes matters almost impossible to solve. I take it a very small bit at a time and don&#x27;t pressure myself into getting it all off on one day. That way I am very happy with the product and don&#x27;t kill myself in the process.&lt;br /&gt;No issues with product itself. The quantities supplied are adequate. The only thing you may need after a few uses are more Gigi collars which help keep things non messy.</li>
    <li> The wax grips onto the hair really well. I&#x27;d say it gets almost every hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem for me was how messy it got. The wax was dripping everywhere so I had to lay a towel on the ground. I&#x27;d imagine if you were lying down and had someone doing it for you, there would be much less dripping.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a great product, simple instructions, and pain is more or less the same as with soft wax.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It works exactly as advertised and it was so easy.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for me a year ago since every time I go to the salon it cost $20 to go get a wax, It paid for it&#x27;s self very quickly! I just ordered two more for Christmas gifts and the shipping was very fast! I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This was a really great product. I use it to wax my eyebrows, lip, arms, and thighs, and it works very well! I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love this! This was my first time waxing in general (and I almost gave myself a complete Brazilian). I was really surprised with the results. This stuff only sticks to your hair, not your skin. And it&#x27;s really effective - once I remove one strip I don&#x27;t have to go back to that area again. I actually felt more comfortable waxing myself than when professionals do it. And the results were almost as good (granted, it was my first time). I can&#x27;t believe I paid less for this than one session of waxing. Never going back :)</li>
    <li> This kit is essential for body hair removal. It is so easy, just requires patience. You get your moneys worth considering salon prices for waxing. Perfect for eyebrows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy, not much clean up and one container of the wax has lasted me almost 6 months!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive this products is! Works very well, pulls off all the hair with minimal pain! Love it, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> everything is awesome, except for the cooling gel, i&#x27;m allergic to whatever&#x27;s in it - skin itches for 3 days after!</li>
    <li> THE BEST!! 100% RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> Perfect Wax no pain at all for all kind of hairs. mine are very hard...............Definitely recommend it..........will buy it again......................</li>
    <li> The Instruction CD does not work. It cannot be read by my laptop.&lt;br /&gt;I had to figure it out by myself</li>
    <li> Ok, everyone is here because they&#x27;re tired of paying X amount every month or so to the aesthetician. Cut out the middle man (or woman for this matter), and do it yourself! Waxing is painful whether you do it, or they do it! It&#x27;s that simple. So long as you maintain your waxing on a pretty regular schedule (for me 4-6 weeks), the pain and hair growth is reduced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, it took me almost FOUR hours to do my own Brazilian the first time (I had issues with literally ripping at my own skin, finding the right angles, taking breaks, etc.) but the second time I did it, it took me less than an hour!! I love the fact that I can give myself a wax in the comfort of my own dwelling! Plus, I&#x27;m saving money-- because let&#x27;s face it, if you&#x27;re vain about your appearance, you&#x27;re vain about your appearance... I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re married or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had to leave a review because Gigi is the truth! As long as you&#x27;re familiar with what direction to apply the wax.. pre- &amp; post- prepping... aftercare.. this is a simple process. And if you don&#x27;t.. well lo&#x27; and behold, that&#x27;s what the fabulous world of Google is for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, yes like others have said, this can get a little messy. I recommend doing it in your bathroom (I sit on the closed toilet seat with a towel under me) with newspaper on the floor so it&#x27;s an easy clean up. I also choose doing it in the bathroom because there&#x27;s plenty of mirrors at my disposal. Keep your tweezers (and alcohol to sterilize them) handy for those loose hairs! Lots of sticks come in the packing, and I chose not to buy the extra covers that go around the neck to protect the warmer. I&#x27;ll probably just use cardboard from discarded boxes once the original cover gets too gunked up! Good luck!!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It did remove hair, although I found it to be messy and time consuming. The skin oil bottle somehow loosened and leaked over everything, ruining a lot of nearby items I had on my table. It&#x27;s not too entirely painful once you get the hang of it, which takes some time. My biggest issue, though, is that the wax gets very dirty, very quickly.. So my advice to anyone who is looking to do full-leg waxes (or is Italian, or some other ethnicity with thicker, longer hairs) is to buy extra cans of wax to keep on hand. Otherwise you&#x27;re just using the same wax over and over with all your plucked hairs inside the mixture- not pretty and I would guess over time, not as effective.</li>
    <li> It definitely works how it was marketed/advertised. Melts it in about 20 mins or so. The wax hardens quick which is a plus for me coz I&#x27;m not that patient. Hahaha. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I have had several Brazilians before done at the European Wax center and love the results but $60+ a month is just so much money. I decided to invest in this at home wax kit because of the reviews and price. This kit comes with 1 14oz can of hard wax, a warmer, a pre and post wax skin calming products,a dvd, and applicators. An outrageously good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went at it last night, and I have got to say, IT HURTS. I forgot how bad it hurt until I ended up trying to work off dried up wax for 45 minutes because I lost the guts to pull. You have got to be prepared to pull that strip. I learned that small, like little baby sections, make it much easier to cope with. Despite all my troubles (I did ask for them, after all) I did a pretty good wax job for my first time at home. I&#x27;m actually really glad I bought this product, because for $30.00 I got a good wax and I can now feel free to wax again whenever I want at only the additional cost of more wax. Even after using what I feel was probably an unnecessary amount of wax, I still have a ton left and will not need to refill for a while. There&#x27;s got to be atleast another 5-6 waxes (if not more) out of a single can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The warmer keeps the wax at the right temperature, not to hot not to cold, and the wax seems to be of good quality. If pulled at the right time, there is a solid good wax strip. I tried to mimic the EWC the best that I could and I am really happy. No more ridiculous $60.00 a month and good bye shaving. I will come back to this product again and again and I feel that I will only get better at it as I continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> This waxing kit works well, and really does remove hair quickly and easily. If you&#x27;re a beginner its best to master smaller, less complicated areas first before moving on to do a Brazilian wax.</li>
    <li> This product has already paid for itself with one use. And I don&#x27;t think it hurts as bad as when you go get it done. The ONLY thing I would recommend is buying the Gigi Wax Off. I saw other recommended it, but I figured I didn&#x27;t need it. WRONG. Definitely purchase it with the kit because you WILL need it. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> This type of waxing won&#x27;t come natural to you if you never had hard wax applied to you. I go to someone professionally every month and watch her wax me for 6 months until I felt like I had an idea of what she was doing. Finally I purchased this waxing kit, watch the video 3 times and then watch some youtube videos. This is such an awesome product so if it&#x27;s not working, then you need more practice. Perhaps visit a salon and see how others do it. It does take patience and it can get messy so prepare for newspaper so it doesn&#x27;t get all over your bathroom floor. I save so much money by waxing myself.</li>
    <li> If you get waxed on a regular basis like I do, then this is a great investment. Especially at this steal of a price being offered by Amazon. You can look on ebay and you will be paying significantly more, especially for a set. I love how convenient it is to have my own was kit, and it is already saved me (and my friends) a bunch of money. Super easy to use as well, just follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair! I got this to do brazilian waxing on myself. It is less painful than other products I had been using. The pre wax oil really helps remove the hard wax. It took longer to melt the wax than I had thought, however it was worth the wait. It worked as I expected. I even tried waxing my armpits with it. Keep in mind my hair is very thick and it wasnt fully grown yet. The wax was able to remove ever single hair and left my skin so soft! I will keep on buying Gigi wax! I did all of my bikini area and all brazilian waxing plus armpits and the wax container still looks full!</li>
    <li> Had no real problems with this kit, I felt like you don&#x27;t get very much wax for the price and the pre-epilation oil is complete crap but the actual wax, and the actually warmer unit are super awesome. Also found out this is the unit that smaller salons (like, the ones in wal-mart etc) use so you know it&#x27;ll last :)</li>
    <li> Best brazilian waxing kit ever!! Super easy to use and not as painful as I thought it would be. I was reluctant for years to do this by myself, but this wax has an incredible quality and will not stick to your skin, only to the hair. I&#x27;m never going to a salon again and pay ridiculous amounts of money to get a bikini wax. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Love it, I&#x27;ve done several waxes with this kit and liked it so much I bought another as a gift for my mom!</li>
    <li> The product is working great so far, I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now. I&#x27;ve done myself 3 times and my boyfriend&#x27;s sister once ! I have one more good use before I have to get some more hard body wax. The ONLY thing is I wish it came with more big sticks for your private area but it&#x27;s kool, I just have to buy alot from the store !</li>
    <li> I find this product very useful. warms fast and is very easy to use. the wax it comes with is excellent for waxing your legs, but i m afraid (for me at least) it is not thick enough for Brazilian waxing. if I try to apply a thicker layer it just runs down my skin, because it s too liquid when warm. what I had to do was wait for the first layer to cool a bit so I could apply a second and third layer. I didn&#x27;t use muslin strips, maybe I should&#x27;ve;the set did not provide those. The idea is, it just took so long for the Brazilian waxing, maybe next time it&#x27;ll be easier since now I know what to do.</li>
    <li> Wow! A real money saver.  Easy to use and it pays for itself by not having to go to a salon!</li>
    <li> Can get messy, but works well....you have to move quickly because it dries fast</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit to use on myself in lieu of having to go to the salon and drop $70 each time I wanted a bikini wax.  It does take some time getting used to using hard wax as you apply it directly to your skin, let it dry/cool, then rip it off.  It can be messy, but if you make sure the wax is the right temperature (think the consistency of honey) then it isn&#x27;t as messy.  Giving yourself a bikini wax is tricky regardless!  I have noticed, though that the quality of the wax has declined the more I use it.  There is a TON of wax in this kit. I have used it probably 5 times so far, but each time the wax becomes more difficult to use.  Getting the consistency correct has become harder.  That said it is still effective and I am glad I made this purchase.  Definitely use the gel and oil that is included in the kit.  it will make the entire process much easier.  For those that have complained about in gown hairs...that has nothing to do with the wax and everything to do with the fact that our bodies are meant to have hair down there!  If in grown hairs is an issue then you need to exfoliate when you shower.</li>
    <li> as expected, not really enough wax :( and there should be a warning on the video.. hello full frontal!</li>
    <li> i like it but it did not come with the cloth strips to to take wax off with</li>
    <li> Its super hard to get the wax off. I advise buying waxing strips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many other products and it&#x27;s very easy to use, but probably not a good product for beginners, as it takes a while to get the hang of it.  It takes more planning than the microwave products out there.  But since I can no longer find my favorite microwave wax (Nair Salon Divine), this is a very nice alternative.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice kit to start with! I will just let you know now, that the lotions that come with this aren&#x27;t that great though. For instance, the wax removal lotion does not work for me at all! Other then the lotions, everything else is great! I recommend this to all of my girlfriends.</li>
    <li> This kit is easy to use and not nearly as painful as the cheap wax from the drug store.  I was amazed how little pain I felt compared to the cold wax I was using.  I had no bruising and very little mess.  The DVD makes it easy to follow the instructions. I like the idea of doing this at home and not going to a stranger!  Highly recommend for first time waxers like me!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Easy to use! Happy customer!</li>
    <li> I received this a week ago and purposely waited a week before leaving my review.  First of all, I had no issues at all with the packaging.  I know many people had problems with things leaking.  Both bottles that came with the kit arrived intact.  I thought it was well-packaged.  I bought the wax to use on my underarms and tried it on Saturday.  It took a good 40 minutes for the wax to heat up, but that really didn&#x27;t bother me either.  Waxing is not something you do in a hurry.  You do it when you have plenty of time.  I followed the directions and it worked perfectly.  I used the oil prior to waxing and there was very little discomfort when I pulled off the wax.  Any pain involved was only because I probably had too much hair growth.  This wax will clearly remove hair that is barely a quarter of an inch long.  Also, I had no irritation at all.  I was concerned about that because I have sensitive skin, but nothing.  All in all, one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.</li>
    <li> i got it in a great shape i highly recommend it i got it in a great shape i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I used to pay a salon to wax my face, dye my eye lashes and brows.  With a little investment up front, I am going to save at least $300 to $500 a year doing it all on my own.  Practice makes perfect so be patient.  Don&#x27;t forget you need the liquid oxidant to activate the dye.  I only wish I started doing this two years ago!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine got me hooked on Brazilian waxes and living in a warm climate I could never got back! I am in shorts and bathing suits so much the waxes were amazing.  However, $50-$70 including tip to get it done at a wax center was eating up my budget!  At the cost of this kit, it paid for itself and I probably have up to four more waxes worth left! AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival, shipping was fast.  The kit comes in a box with cd, hard wax, cardboard cut out, pre-wax oil, post soothing gel, warmer and wax sticks.  This kit is a hard wax kit therefore there are no strips, which is better in my opinion.  I watched the video was was helpful (explicit but hey it&#x27;s as real as it gets with a braziillian right??).  I placed the wax into the cardboard cut out provided and placed wax in warmer set on high.  * I highly suggest using the cardboard cut out as it helped with mess!  No wax dripped into the warmer itself and stayed nicely in the wax container.*  The wax was then melted and I turned the wax down to LOW for about 30 minutes.  After that I went to town and cleared most hair down there.  What I found difficult was technique if anything.  The wax did not hurt and was actually better than going to get it done professionally.  Keep in mind that if you are a first time it will hurt, come on, it&#x27;s a brazillian.  However as I have been getting waxes for almost a year, my hair is more fine.  However, knowing what the right temperature of the wax is is just going to take time, practice and experience.  Even on low the wax was too how to immediately dip in and place on body/hair.  You must twirl the stick as directed in video to cool for 5 seconds and then place thick on your body. For me, overall the pain was not bad, I took a tylenol before the wax and a hot shower to open pores.  The only trouble was getting the technique right after a few strips and then it was smooth sailing.  It took me approximately 1.5 hours but for my first time it was much longer still adjusting to the technique. I will be continuing these waxes on my own and SAVING money from now on! So happy I did this, I feel so proud of myself because i&#x27;m saving so much money! To imagine I spent 50-70 a wax and now I only have to replenish my supplies! It is a must try! If it doesn&#x27;t work out you could at least use the kit to wax your legs or another less painful area. Worth Trying.</li>
    <li> This product is great came exactly like the picture and it gives you a CD on how to wax. Defiantly Recommend.!!</li>
    <li> So I was excited to get this product because I&#x27;ve been on Themis DIY binge, realizing I can do whatever I&#x27;m paying another person to do. So with that said, I&#x27;m SO HAPPY with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s easy and the hard wax doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the strips.&lt;br /&gt;2. I prepared myself for a mess so I put a towel down, paper towel and cotton balls next to me.&lt;br /&gt;3. The wax took about an hour to heat, then I kept it in between low abd medium throughout the process. This made the wax stay constant.&lt;br /&gt;4. I did a full brazillian, yes, everything!&lt;br /&gt;5. I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve paid another person to do this.&lt;br /&gt;6. It took almost a hour and a half with job help but it&#x27;s worth saving $60-$100 a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girls are coming to try it after I sent them the final results. Don&#x27;t judge, I was to excited abd shocked and had to share this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy buy buy! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this kit 3 stars mainly because it was my first time with this type of kit and I would like to think that was part of the problem. First of all, my instructions came in French and Spanish, but not English. The ingredients were in English, but not the instructions, so I assume there was a page or two missing from my instruction booklet. I was able to go online and find these easily so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, just a disappointing way to start with a new product. Next, it took 45 minutes for the wax to even *begin* melting, so I gave it 15 more minutes for a total of one hour of warm up time - this is much more time than recommended, but obviously I couldn&#x27;t do anything with a solid block of wax so I had to wait. After an hour, the edges had melted so I started there. But the part of the wax that was melted must have been too hot (while most of the wax was still a solid block), as it was very drippy. At first it wouldn&#x27;t stick to the skin at all so I tried another small area. This time, it applied fine, but wouldn&#x27;t peel off. It dried on and was a major pain to remove as I had to do it tiny sections at a time. It did, however, rip the hair out as I was finally able to get the wax off. It also ruined my manicure.&lt;br /&gt;I expect to try again, but it will be very difficult to tell when the wax is ready if more than half doesn&#x27;t melt at all while the rest is too hot and runny. Maybe I got a bad warmer. If you have a TON of patience (which I do not), I might recommend this product, but I would really suggest having someone else do it, or wear rubber gloves.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I stuck with the Moom wax strips, but since I already have this product and most people love it, I am going to try a few more times.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous methods and products for hair removal and this works better than anything I previously tried. You can save lots of money by doing this yourself instead of going to a salon.</li>
    <li> My mom owns one of these at home. Hers works perfectly fine, and takes about 30 minutes to melt all the wax. I bought one for college and oh my, it&#x27;s been an hour and my wax is still not melted all the way. I honestly believe that I got a defective product :/</li>
    <li> Takes some practice but it works. My only issue is that it gets too hot.</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 stars but the heater looked like it was previously used. All the products looked to be brand new just the heater had worn like damage and the lid for it was broken. May have been from shipping but it was wrapped and in a box that was in a box so I think it was used. Shipping was on time and you get everything that was pictured. I was compensated and it was no hassle. So yes I recommend the product. I have yet to try it however.</li>
    <li> This set claims to be professional. This is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;WAX&lt;br /&gt;1. The wax does not stick to the strip&lt;br /&gt;2. Therefore, the wax builds on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. The wax cools almost inmediatelly over the skin what it makes almost imposible to remove in a normal way. I had to peel it off with my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARMER&lt;br /&gt;1. Normal size&lt;br /&gt;2. Attractive&lt;br /&gt;3. Very nice electric cord&lt;br /&gt;4. It takes almost 2 HOURS to melt a normal size of wax can. By the way, instructions say that it should take 20-25 minutes. By far this is not true or the equipment is defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wood sticks:&lt;br /&gt;1. Very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;2. Nice diagonal  ends cut&lt;br /&gt;3. Nice length.&lt;br /&gt;4. NIce variety of sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre and after samples&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SKIN PREPARATION&lt;br /&gt;1. The pre is so oily that is imposible to proceed with waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER WAXING SOLUTION&lt;br /&gt;This product is nice. It really calms down the heat after waxing; specialy when I was forced to remove the wax part by part with my finger nails. THIS WAS PAINFUL. Ofcourse, this was caused because the wax solidifies on the skin so fast that cannot be removed with the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because the wood sticks and after waxing solution are very good.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t remove the hair as described</li>
    <li> I never waxed my self before and I had very good results with this kit.... I have very sentive skin and this kit it&#x27;s perfect for me and the price it&#x27;s good. You are going to have salon/spa results  for less money.</li>
    <li> i love this thing it is very very easy no mess&lt;br /&gt;unlike the other ones that come with a strip it is very messy and didnt work for me&lt;br /&gt;i reccomend to everyone !</li>
    <li> I love this kit. It includes everything you need to wax. The heater is pretty small so it&#x27;s easy to store as well.</li>
    <li> i try it one time and it is so good&lt;br /&gt;i love it&lt;br /&gt;i advise everybody to use it it is great</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I have a 12 page paper to write and I just had to stop here first and write a review on this amazing product.  First I used it as a bikini wax, and it literally took out every hair!  This was my first time doing an at home wax, and YES it took me FOREVER.  Getting the hang of how to wax yourself will take some practice, but let me assure you that THIS is the wax you want to use.  Second, I actually bought this at Sally&#x27;s for like $17.00 and did not get the warmer, instead, I just threw it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes and it melts it down great.  I will say however that you will have to play with the wax to make sure its the right consistency, like waiting for it to cool to a pliable texture, or having to put it back in the oven to warm it up again.  I just wanted to let you guys know that it is possible to use this wax without the warmer, and for the price on amazon, it&#x27;s probably not a bad idea to buy it anyways, but I just didn&#x27;t want to wait on shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I used the wax on my upper lip and eyebrows just now, and I&#x27;ll tell you it works great on those area too.  I am just so happy with all the money I&#x27;m saving with this product!  Already paid for itself many times over! I&#x27;m a happy customer :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting Brazilian waxes for years, paying someone to rip hair out all too often. So glad I bought this. It&#x27;s great! Took me less than 30 minutes once the wax got heated up. The first rip of the wax was a little scary, but then it was all good. Definitely won&#x27;t be paying anyone to do this anymore!</li>
    <li> The product I received was damaged.  The lid is cracked and the 3 different types of applicators are all missing!</li>
    <li> this is my first waxing kit, and I nailed it. This brazilian hard wax is great because it hardens and you pull the whole thing off. My skin was not affected by it and it adheres to hair awesome. I didn&#x27;t make a mess and it was fairly easy to administer. I did a brazilian wax and my armpit. Glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Sally Beauty Supply. Yes, the wax works and so do the muslin strips but the ABSOLUTE MESS that this is produced is not worth it! Each time I&#x27;ve used this, I can&#x27;t seem to get the extra wax off my counter tops, floor, and self. I tried using baby oil, as well as other wipes and nothing worked, so unfortunately I had to dump this $30 product in the trash and have decided to leave waxing to the experts.</li>
    <li> I always wanted to buy a waxing kit for my personal use but didn&#x27;t know what type of wax or brand to get. After doing some research I came across the Gigi brazilian waxing kit and decided to buy it. I&#x27;ve never waxed before and made sure to do research on the process. I&#x27;ve gone to waxing salons many times before but it got to be too expensive paying over $40 plus tip every 4-5 weeks. I love this product. I was looking for the type of wax that European Wax Center uses because the wax is less painful than the other types of waxes. Hard wax is definitely the way to go. The entire container was good for about 5 waxes in the bikini area. I would definitely recommend the product!</li>
    <li> Just got it and I love it already. I found out about this through my friend and wanted one ever since. With the price and all it brings I think it&#x27;s perfect! It doesn&#x27;t bring the strips but you don&#x27;t need them, the wax drys and it is able to be pulled of with ease. It is not to bulky and the delivery is very quick. The oil and soothing gel is very nice as well!</li>
    <li> I ordered the kit yesterday with estimated delivery date for tomorrow( 2 days after an order) but i received it today,with excitement opened my package and found my kit covered in pre epilation oil:((( the bottle wasn&#x27;t closed and saturated everything else in it...gladly the wax warmer and wax itself was wrapped in a bag and also somehow miraculously dvd wasn&#x27;t affected,so i just wiped the rest stuff off and decided to keep,because i am not in the mood to go to post office,return and then wait for a new one to arrive...but i have to say, that is disappointing!!!  That means now i have to buy a new bottle of oil! I will update on the product itself in use and the results.</li>
    <li> Best money I ever spent.Not only has GIGI saved me money bc otherwise I would have to pay for a bikini wax once a month,but gigi has also saved me from a lot of pain.Noone can know your body the way you do and what isn&#x27;t going to hurt.Watching the instructional video also helps a lot. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> yes, you can and should do your own brazilian waxing. with the right products, it&#x27;s maybe 15 minutes. not with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;i struggled through this kit first before trying some variables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first, the heater is cheap. it&#x27;s adequate, but you&#x27;ll get frustrated trying to get temp control. mine broke, leaving the two settings OFF &amp; MOLTEN LAVA anywhere on the slider. 5 stars to amazon for the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;second, this wax is a NIGHTMARE. imagine flinging honey all over your legs and bathroom, then trying to clean it up. that&#x27;s your life with this. bonus, it will stay gooey and attract dirt and never harden enough to pick off. so it&#x27;s like having gum everywhere, forever. the &#x27;wax remover&#x27; does NOT get it off of your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as to using the wax, it&#x27;s hard to get the right temp, then it doesn&#x27;t spread, so you get uneven globs and have to WAIT for each section to get hard enough to peel off. but parts of it will still be goo. trust me, it takes too long and is a HOT MESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this kit will turn you off to home waxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i replaced it with the satin smooth kit. what a world of difference. even if you stick with this heater, get the satin smooth hard wax, which hardens &amp; peels clean, and you&#x27;re done with no cleanup.</li>
    <li> I have never ever waxed anything, so waxing my hoo-ha was a somewhat unnerving prospect.  I wanted to learn however, since 1) I don&#x27;t want to pay a salon $50 per (embarrassing) visit to handle it, and 2) I&#x27;ll be on a cruise in a couple months and didn&#x27;t want to bother shaving while on board.  I received the kit last night and a few hours later, I was hoo-ha hair free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually thought the pain would be worse.  I mean, it was NO walk in the park.  Certain areas down there were on fire temporarily, but the pain dissipates quickly.  The video that accompanies the kit was pretty informative, but did not dispense the most critical information: How long is the wax supposed to be on your skin before pulling it up?  I found, after using it, that it&#x27;s anywhere from 20-30 seconds depending on the thickness of the wax you lay down.  If it&#x27;s tacky, press it down and wait a few more seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard wax is perfect.  It does not, as purported, stick to the skin.  I spent a good 1.5 hours waxing this one area, but now that I know what I&#x27;m doing, I expect it to go much quicker next time.  (At least cut in half.)  I might also get some topical anesthetic for the few parts that are hyper sensitive.  (Not needed for 85% of that area though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have this kit, I will definitely continue buying the hard wax.  Wish it came with a few extra lid guards though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s a little messy. You actually have to know what u doing to do a good job</li>
    <li> This was my first time doing my own bikini wax and it came out great! It was not difficult, I didn&#x27;t make much of a mess at all, however I did get wax on some places of my skin that was difficult to get off. And the instructional DVD that comes with the kit was helpful. As far as the hair removal, once done my skin was smooth. I did not have to keep going over areas or tweeze to remove hair that didn&#x27;t come off with the first wax so all in all great kit...very satisfied.</li>
    <li> my wife ordered this kit some time ago, she said it was easy and painless. when we first got the kit she watched the DVD that came with it...it was very graphic!!!!!!LOL</li>
    <li> Before using this product, I had never had a wax done professionally or by myself. So, I had really no idea what to expect. I use sugar wax on my eyebrows, but honestly that&#x27;s pretty painful and I thought that if people are using this hard wax on their bikini areas, it MUST be better than sugar wax! Well I bought the kit that comes with the warmer. I also bought the cardboard rings that go around the can to keep the warmer clean. The kit comes with a DVD. I watched it, and it seemed doable. I am not a very hairy person, and my hair is fine, too. Anyway, after a pretty easy learning curve, I would recommend this product to anyone who is tired of shaving. I have used it on my underarms, which works phenomenally. I use it to wax my bikini area, and I really can&#x27;t believe that it doesn&#x27;t hurt more than it does.  (I will say that I mostly just wax the area not covered by my swimsuit, plus an inch or so inward.  The most sensitive areas (you know what they are) are tricky, and I personally find it very painful).  The pre-waxing oil seems to work great. I do get some ingrown hairs, but bought an antiseptic gel to use immediately after waxing. Then, when that&#x27;s dry, I use baby powder. Then next few times I shower, I exfoliate and use the gel/baby powder again. The ingrown hairs are much, much better! The real trick is to use the wax when it is not runny at all. It should be \\&quot;gloopy\\&quot;. I heat it for a little while on hot, then to extra low. Sometimes I even turn it off for a few minutes. The wax does not need to cool very much before you pull it off again. If you wait too long, it will obviously harden too much. Also, you will learn that you need some \\&quot;lead area\\&quot; (i.e. a hairless starting point) for getting a grip on the wax. So, apply it so the end where you&#x27;re going to grab it and pull is just outside the hair growth, and that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll hang onto it to remove it. Way less painful that way.  If something goes wrong, you always use a small piece of wax from a previous pull, and it will stick to the end you want to remove- like a handle, for generating better leverage.</li>
    <li> awesome kit, but i need some practice before i can do it effortlessly. right now it takes a while and a little bit messy, but not as painful as i though it would be! if you are patient enough and want to save money, buy it! it does pretty good job with the hair! ( although my hair grew back in about a week...? but i read somewhere you have to do it regularly then it will be less and less hair, i have dark not soft hair)</li>
    <li> HUGE money saver. With practice, you can get professional results. Inner bits and the lowest part above the inner bits hurt the most (at least for me). I had gotten a brazilian in a salon once and loved it, but the price was too steep for me, so I purchased this kit. My first time started off great on top, but was very painful in the sensitive bits. Hopefully the tips below help other beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;* Watch some youtube videos (and/or the DVD) or get it done professionally first.&lt;br /&gt;* Use a towel or a beadsheet to cover the area you&#x27;ll be in.&lt;br /&gt;* Have a waste basket ready and no distractions.&lt;br /&gt;* Baby powder helps the wax not stick to the skin (I had a little piece of skin get ripped off without the powder - ouch!).&lt;br /&gt;* The pre epilation oil not only reduces the pain by more than half, it also keeps the wax as one big piece and prevents it from sticking to the skin. (I apply the wax to oiled skin.)&lt;br /&gt;* It can help to rub the wax up and then down the hair growth to capture them into the wax (then pull against hair).&lt;br /&gt;* Leave a ridge at the end from which you&#x27;ll pull (maybe use fingers to massage it out while it dries for better grip).&lt;br /&gt;* DO NOT wait too long - once it feels rubbery, PULL. If you wait until it is hard, it will break into pieces (ouch)!&lt;br /&gt;* If you&#x27;re nervous about some hard-to-reach areas, you can use tiny patches and hold skin around it.&lt;br /&gt;* Good lighting and mirror really help.&lt;br /&gt;* Some people like Captain Morgan pose for hard-to-reach places - I just liked squatting with a mirror. Do whatever works best :).&lt;br /&gt;* Advil or tylenol 1-hr beforehand might help (some use anesthetic spray/lotion).&lt;br /&gt;* Don&#x27;t do it 1 week before your monthly or during it (it will be more painful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Both lights (red and green) are always lit, so not sure when the temperature is set.&lt;br /&gt;* DVD is not very good in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;* Takes long to melt, but no big deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just learning how to wax &amp; if your a beginner like me this is a great starter kit. Waxing is so addicting, your going to want to wax everything once to start.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I had a great experience. You should try, because you can do by yourself!  Spetacular. I&#x27;m glad with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m not going to write a review telling you how to use this product. A lot of other people have already done that. Suffice it to say, I love this product and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few side notes: the instructions on top of the hard wax pot were all in spanish! I couldn&#x27;t read a word of it. So I spent about 30 minutes using Google translate to figure out how long it needed to heat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the lid that goes on top was cracked! I did not return it because, 1. I didn&#x27;t want to pay shipping just for a little lid, and 2. I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the fact that they might not send me another.</li>
    <li> Recommending this to EVERYONE.  It is hard to get the left over wax off, and I used a lot of wax my first time.  It was actually kind of fun to do it! No bruising, no ingrown hairs, this kit is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time doing my own brazilian and it is wayyyy better than paying a stranger to do this at a pricey salon.  You will not regret buying this!!!! I wish I had bought it earlier and saved myself pain and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only gets slightly painful closer to midline, but not really bad at all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS.  Plus, the seller I used shipped the kit 2 days earlier!</li>
    <li> I am Brazilian, and I can tell this is exactly like Brazilian wax kit. It is very practical. Great product I recommend.</li>
    <li> Every woman MUST have one of these at home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So convenient, and with practice it is not to hard to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A MUST have for us ladies!</li>
    <li> This warmer does what it is supposed to. It melts the wax. When the outer parts were melted I flipped the center part and the rest melted quickly. It was fully melted in an hour. I read reviews prior to ordering and saw the comment of &amp;#34;Go get a professional wax before doing this yourself.&amp;#34; I should have listened. I failed miserably in every attempt. None of the bottles were opened or leaking. The box was packed nicely and all contents listed were inside.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different waxes for my bikini line, and none of them have ever worked. This one, however, did the job and did it well.&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the instructions before using it, though. You don&#x27;t need any cloth strips. Just apply the pre-wax oil, the wax, and you pull it off just by the wax. It did a wonderful job and I don&#x27;t ever have to $80 for waxing ever again! It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I waxed and there is no hair growth. So, this is wonderful stuff :)</li>
    <li> I used Surgi Brazilian wax before I found this and the GIGI wax is so much better! It&#x27;s definitely a bargain for that price and it gets the job done. However, there are a couple stray hairs that the wax misses no matter how thoroughly I apply the wax. That always irritates me a little, but i can always tweeze it. I also don&#x27;t like that it takes FOREVER to warm up even at the hottest setting. It melts first from the sides, leaving a big hard glob in the middle. But I appreciate that when applied correctly, the wax strips come off very cleanly. I can even wax before I leave in the morning and the redness will be gone by the time I get to work. I&#x27;ve been waxing so much that I don&#x27;t feel the need to use any of the oils. Just a little baby powder to avoid the moisture before I start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To beginners - the first couple times will hurt like no other. For best least painful results, rip the strips off in the opposite direction of hair growth as fast as  you can.</li>
    <li> Great kit! Use an old towel under you while using wax because it can drop everywhere if too hot. Best used if thicker. Do not bring to Europe and use an adapter! Will set on fire. Trust me, I know.</li>
    <li> Very time consuming to wax large areas, but it works and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as other waxes. Be sure to pre-oil the area!</li>
    <li> The wax takes forever to melt and forever to &#x27;set up&#x27; on the skin. I have used other hard wax brands and this one was just a waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I had to wax over the same area multiple times to remove hair. I worked for quite a long time trying to remove leg hairs but ended up shaving after all the trouble of trying to use this mess. Didn&#x27;t remove any armpit hair. I was verry disappointed that I wasted my money on this.</li>
    <li> Works as promised. Haven&#x27;t watched the included dvd, but written instructions are good. Quality products. Gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Works really good, will save you a lot from going to salon.</li>
    <li> Dont need straps. It can be remove with figers !! Love it ! I just wish it would take less time to heat up. But its a most have</li>
    <li> A brazilian done at the salon costs me $70. I love the Gigi kit because I can wax in the privacy of my home, at a fraction of the cost. The post-epilation cooling gel is the absolute best part of the waxing experience!</li>
    <li> this product is great, just all around perfection, i would definitely recommend it to any one and every one...BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> such a money saver,no longer have to go to the salon</li>
    <li> This is a great product and value for a Brazilian waxing kit. The video was extremely helpful since I had never waxed or been waxed before and I was doing it myself without a second hand.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was the video talks about needing a pre-hon epilation cleanser before you wax and my kit did not come with one. Since it is a starter kit I think it&#x27;d be slightly better to include the cleanser as well since the video spoke of it importance.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I had a great experience with the product and will continue using the hard wax.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t get all the wax off you are in big trouble because it&#x27;s almost impossible to get off your skin. It will definitely take some practice. Overall it will take the hair off and heats up nicely and decent price.</li>
    <li> I like it easy to use and it gentle on skin.  except the covered is crack when I received it.</li>
    <li> First time user, worked well for me. No issues.</li>
    <li> Wax gets stuck and hard to pull out very messy will not order again</li>
    <li> I really like this kit. It is the best bang for your buck. I tried buying a kit at the local beauty store and it was twice as much. Love it!</li>
    <li> Quality product for a really good price.  So easy to use.  ZERO mess.  Excellent.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my kit but when I opened it my wax warmer was cracked and something inside was rattling as if broken. Very dissatisfied, I really would like a refund or a new set. When that happens my rating will definitely go up because I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about it.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised... And only $34.50 with Prime shipping. Make sure you use the provided oil beforehand, though. The first time I self-waxed, I got lazy finishing up the \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; part and wax sticking to skin is the worst; no one likes that chaffed feeling.</li>
    <li> I really like this wax. It removes hair throughly and is pretty easy to use. The warmer works great, the wax warmed up quickly but was not too hot. The only issue that the wax is impossible to get off the ground or sink if spilled.</li>
    <li> Great product for the cost.</li>
    <li> Love this! Easy, private, and i didn&#x27;t make a mess like i thought i would</li>
    <li> So happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Omg did this wax hurt. I have used just a regular honey wax and thought oh this should b awesome... HECK TO THE NO! feels like u r ripping ur skin and then some off. Take it from someone who waxes on the regular, this is not the wax for u! Oh and the instructions say to put the oil on b4 u wax..... r they silly. If u put oil on the wax won&#x27;t stick. I followed the directions and not only did I have to wax that part 3 times but it made me break out. By the 5th strip I was prayin it was over and looking for any other way to get this off my skin then pulling it off. Oh and I should mention this was on my legs. Could not imagine using this for a brazilian. *shutter*</li>
    <li> I like it!! but the cover of warmer is broken when I got the package.</li>
    <li> The wax warmer is good. I feel it is little slow to heat the wax in it. The Brazilian wax did not work out very well for me but then that is just a personal opinion. I did not really use pre epilation oil and post wax cooling gel.</li>
    <li> The machine itself is great but the wax is a joke. You can&#x27;t nicely rip it off. You have to peel of tiny piece by tiny piece defeating the purpose of what waxing off a section ought to be. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Used it for the first time the day after it arrived. It arrived on time. Still have plenty of wax.</li>
    <li> great product &amp; fast delivery</li>
    <li> Do not stick to the body and is very effective in the removal of hair and a little pain that very cool</li>
    <li> If you want good results, you better have know how. Lucky for me, I know how.</li>
    <li> The wax is almost impossible to get off quickly. Leaves so much wax behind. The wax Remover doesn&#x27;t work that great and it&#x27;s expensive. Too much picking. Causing much more unnecessary pain. Started using an epilator on it. Rather pick off one by one then try picking off wax in one area for 5 minutes. Even with pre epilator gel. No good. Props to those who can work it.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use. Takes about 30 min. for the Brazilian wax to melt. The paddle sizes are nice (I wish they offered a large pack of multi-sized paddles that you could purchase with the unit). I immediately ordered more cardboard collars...there are only a couple in the kit and you definitely need them. I&#x27;m not a fan of the pre-epilation oil or the post wax gel. I prefer a post wax numbing liquid. The gel is gloppy and messy to apply. But the unit itself is a winner.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, a little messy but hey we don&#x27;t work in a salon. Definitely a better alternative than painful waxing strips. You just wait for the wax to cool off and then you quickly peel it off. Very simple. I guess the only setback is that you have to get the wax to the right consistency, which takes time and patience. However the results are amazing if you follow the directions.</li>
    <li> First time doing a Brazilian wax and I did it myself.  This product was perfect! It hurt but wasn&#x27;t so bad and went quick. I bruise easily but did not have any bruises with this wax on bikini area like others. The wax warmer kept the wax at perfect temperture. I set it on high for 40 min then turned it on low. Wax was not too hot and did not stick to my skin. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Saves me $30 every other week...great investment</li>
    <li> I love this kit! Before this I would sometimes go to the salon and sometimes use my microwavable wax kit. This is so much better. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of hard wax. I&#x27;ve liked the dvd that came with it just because I wasn&#x27;t sure how to heat it up properly.</li>
    <li> best for home waxing loved i!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, no regrets! Don&#x27;t be scared of trying out hard wax, this is very simple stuff! Watch the CD it comes with, it will teach you how to wax, and read a couple of articles beforehand so you&#x27;re better prepared, but you don&#x27;t need more than that, it was really easy even though it was my first time and on a very sensitive area too.  The kit is excellent, I first went to a Sally Beauty store and was getting worried because of how expensive everything was going to be ($75 for just the warmer, what a joke. By the way don&#x27;t buy from there if you can help it, it&#x27;s incredibly overpriced) but realized that I should first look up online for more options (duh) and here is everything you need for less than $35, what a deal! I recommend maybe making or buying some paper collars, although if you try to avoid a mess (it will be messy either way, but you can prevent the worst) you can keep reusing the same collar for quite a bit. Everything should last for quite a few sessions, so it&#x27;s not expensive at all.  Pain wise, I was pleasantly surprised that it hurt a lot less than I expected. I used to use sugar wax and it always hurt a lot, not to mention it would make skin very tender and wouldn&#x27;t grab hair in some areas properly (armpits for me)  I know a lot of reviewers already said this, but make sure to cover the area you&#x27;re gonna work on because that wax will drip against your best efforts. I recommend something like an old towel, newspaper or cardboard, so you can just throw it away after you&#x27;re done.  The one annoyance is cleanup. Wax that gets stuck is a pain to get off, so be ready for that.</li>
    <li> Cheap wax heater. Takes forever for wax to melt</li>
    <li> Probably the best purchase I have ever made, especially for someone who likes to do everything on her own this is just amazing, it helps you with everything, and  makes your body look amazing and as if you are a professional doing it. Watch youtube videos (a lot of them) and then you will feel like a pro.</li>
    <li> Need around 30~40mins to wait for the wax to melt. With the pre epilator oil, helps to ease the pain! It can be quite messy when apply on your skin. I would suggest cover a layer of plastic before start waxing.</li>
    <li> Everything&#x27;s it was perfect</li>
    <li> WaAY better than running back and forth to the microwave every 5 minutes to reheat wax. Ive been waxing for years, but if I had only known how much simpler one of these little babies would&#x27;ve made my life, I would have invested in this a long time ago.  Great product and well woth the money.</li>
    <li> Wax doesn&#x27;t get removed completely and the skin is sticky!</li>
    <li> Great kit, brought everything you need. Though I didn&#x27;t use the oil prior to waxing because I&#x27;ve heard the surface has to be dry so I&#x27;m not sure why it suggests oil. It worked great. Did my own Brazilian better than the salon I usually go to. Just remember you cannot let the wax settle on your skin for too long or it will become brittle &amp; not come off all at once. Learned that the hard way! Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase !</li>
    <li> First, I ordered this on amazon prime and it took over a week to ship.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the box was poorly packaged. The liquids all spilled and leaked out through the box. They also leaked out onto the wax heater and left a gross brown smear. I tried to return this but Amazon says that they will not return &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; materials. I would never have purchased this if I knew this was going to happen. This product is completely unusable. DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> I put &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; because that suits my feelings towards this product. I do think it is really good for a starter, but I am going to try sugaring before I say &amp;#34;waxing is for me,&amp;#34; because as it is, I really can&#x27;t say I enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This takes about 1 hour to heat up and can be lowered down to the low setting to keep the wax soft while you use it. I spent about 4 - 6 hours actually waxing and I am not done with my whole body yet, it is very tricky to do it alone. I did find the wax it came with to be very effective. I am new to waxing, it was my first time ever doing it, so I did not do a great job. But as far as being usable and decent for the price, I would definitely recommend this for someone who wants to start waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the instructions that come with the kit really aren&#x27;t that great, I would recommend reading around online for techniques and ideas before you start, which is what I did and I definitely recommend that before starting waxing, for safety and efficiency.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dude that hates pulling individual hairs from my nose and ears. I use this about every month or so and it is awesome. Pulling once per side hurts no more than, or maybe even less than, pulling each individual one. Make sure you don&#x27;t over heat the stuff or you will have a much harder time. This thing gets very hot.</li>
    <li> This kit is very good!&lt;br /&gt;This was my first try at waxing and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all!! I am very happy with the product because it is easy to use and also acts very professionally. The warmer is not cheaply made and I also like how they included some other products with the wax and warmer.</li>
    <li> First off I ordered this on the 17th and received It on the 19th so that was amazing I was really happy. The product itself works great I waxed my brows and lip works amazing. I would definitely recommend this I wish I would&#x27;ve got it sooner. Was using a product from avon for about 5 years where I had to heat in microwave . I am loving the wax warmer it comes with.  Didn&#x27;t even take that long to heat up. Great price for great product  .</li>
    <li> LOVE this kit. The hard wax works really well. It&#x27;s a little messy but waxing yourself always is. Happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> I thought I could save money by waxing my own legs and underarms. I knew there would be a learning curve, and I wasn&#x27;t wrong. My first time, I got wax on my chest, my chin, my arm, the bathtub, and the floor (even though I covered the floor with newspaper). I didn&#x27;t get the hair off. The wax stuck to my skin. I also burned myself trying to get the wax to the correct consistency. The second and third attempts weren&#x27;t any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that all of my issues with this product were my fault. I would also divulge that I don&#x27;t shave my legs that often. I cheat and wear long dresses and cool pants to extend the time between facing the razors. Perhaps if I shaved more, was more flexible, or had more patience, this would be a different review. Gleefully, I am me. I just gave this whole thing to my friend and made my appointment to get my waxing done.</li>
    <li> I am not trained, just use at home on myself. I save a ton of money every month by not needing to go to an esthetician and it is pretty easy to use, I learned to always use the lowest setting, it might take a longer time to melt the wax but it will ensure you won&#x27;t get burned. Also, dont forget to use the cleaning and pre-epilation oil, they do make the difference.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this at home for Brazilian waxing (with hubby&#x27;s help).&lt;br /&gt;The wax and the heater are high quality.  Was so much better than any of the store waxes I have tried for any waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Wow I love this machine so much it&#x27;s an amazing price and product! Saved me tons for having to go to the salon every time and I can turn it on before I shower get out and it&#x27;s all melted!</li>
    <li> Not knowing about waxes- I didn&#x27;t know the hard wax would be so difficult. Like the warmer &amp; all, but the hard wax is awful.</li>
    <li> It hurts a lot :( don&#x27;t listen to the people who said it doesn&#x27;t hurt cause they are liars! But it is nice for lips and eyebrows!</li>
    <li> Not bad but the wax was very hard . I wish to have all purpose wax it&#x27;s better than that.</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit and have been pleased with it.  I am not a professional, but I use this about once a month for my underarm and bikini-line waxes and it seems great to me.  I also purchased a can of soft wax and cloth strips for waxing my legs.  But the hard wax is great for smaller areas.  I don&#x27;t use the oil or the cooling gel that came with the kit.  And I probably won&#x27;t use the smaller application sticks, since I don&#x27;t wax my face or eyebrows.  But the price was good for the warmer and the hard wax.  I do wish that the kit came with more of the paper &amp;#34;Clean Collars&amp;#34; to fit around the neck of the warmer.  The collar is very practical and, because it does its job, it gets messy quickly.  I will need to order more of those.  Overall, though, I think this is a good kit for the general home user.</li>
    <li> Just a bit of background on my history as a waxer...hahahaha. I have been waxing my own eyebrows for probably the past 8 years. I&#x27;ve tried another brand of hard wax and the ready wax strips also. I do have to say I prefer the hot wax. I have tried in the past to wax my bikini line with horrific results-I now know it was because I didn&#x27;t know how important having the hair in that area the right length, not knowing good technique, and letting the wax dry too long. Needless to say it was overly painful and scarred me mentally for a long time lol. I personally hate shaving as it drives me nuts when the hair is growing back and I can never pull it off without razor burn no matter what I do (this is using a clean razor and shaving cream vs hair conditioner and moisturizing immediately after).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, my thoughts on this kit: (bought just to use for myself)&lt;br /&gt;i really really really like it. As I said before I&#x27;m somewhat used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; associated with waxing. There is no such thing as a painless wax on any part of your body, however I do think this kit/product makes it as painless as possible. You get so much for the price, and the instructional dvd is EXTREMELY helpful. They do show a model and her &amp;#34;lady parts&amp;#34; but I found it to be very helpful as you can really see how the technique is supposed to work and it stresses the importance of consistency and texture of the wax, temperature, and how to know when it needs to be pulled off as well as how to do that the best way. It also has tips for reducing pain (using the pre-epilation oil and pressing on the area immediately after hair removal). You can tell it was intended for professional use but it is very easy to understand and I don&#x27;t think I could have done it without watching the video. The pre-epilation oil most definitely helps to reduce pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: The first time I removed everything, for lack of better phrasing. It took me around an hour and a half, but I do think that time will shorten with practice. I sat in my bathroom floor with a towel under me and a self standing mirror directly in front of me so I could see what I was doing. I removed small sections at a time. It really is best to go from the bottom up like the video says so that you can leave yourself a sort of tab to pull that isn&#x27;t also pulling out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited a while to review to give feedback on how long it lasts also. I had no hair coming back (except the few that didn&#x27;t completely come out during waxing, which is normal) for 2 weeks. 2 WEEKS! That is huge, and makes the mostly minimal pain of this worth it in my opinion. It has been very easy to upkeep with shaving while waiting for the hair to grow long enough to wax again. I will definitely be using this again. I love it and would recommend it to anyone thinking of waxing.</li>
    <li> Thanks the product is wonderful I would recommend it to anyone and do plan to buy more from your site again</li>
    <li> This waxing kit saved me so much money on razors and waxing services. It&#x27;s easy to use and works great!</li>
    <li> Do NOT put this on your pubic hair! I am using this wax correctly and have gone to cosmetology school and give n countless Brazilian waxes. So I&#x27;m doing this correctly. I purchased this to try to me Brazilian waxes on myself and this wax is too gooey. I currently use a giant piece stuck to my pubic hair that I cannot remove.</li>
    <li> everything is fine just rating on availability until actually use it good job heard it is good product good job</li>
    <li> This wax kit is great. I use it just for myself but I could see it being a great kit for someone doing at home waxing for others. It warms up enough for me within about 45 minutes. I read a lot of reviews on this before I purchased and I have to say one thing to the girl that posted the photos with her bad review on this product- You aren&#x27;t supposed to touch the wax with your bare hands. FYI wax is sticky. Please disregard her review if you are considering getting this product, she is not very intelligent. Once the wax hardens, it is not sticky anymore. Also, a tip for those of you who will do this yourself (something I unfortunately learned through experience) - if you want the wax to harden completely, make sure you are in an air conditioned room or have the windows open and its not 80 degrees outside. Otherwise it will break and cause a ton of pain to you....</li>
    <li> I am so satisfied and the price was very affordable.. I have no complaints at all and will be buying again in the future..came real quick in great condition.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered promptly. It was ready to use from the get go and the  kit brings everything that was needed to start waxing.</li>
    <li> Wow, I am sold. Never going back to the waxing strips. This really doesn&#x27;t hurt. I did not watch the video, I need to for more tips. But I could tell thicker is better and let it cool all the way before pulling it off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this kit so I decided to get my hands on one. I ordered the kit a week ago and it was delivered to me quickly. When I opened the package, I was disappointed at how poorly packaged it was. The red/burgundy lid was cracked in half and the Post Wax Cooling Gel bottle was opened and it spilled a little bit to the box.</li>
    <li> Cumbersome to use, zip-off cloths not included, wax ended up everywhere.  Spent more on olive oil to remove excess wax than it I&#x27;d gone to the salon.</li>
    <li> It is the very best thing ever invented. The hard wax works like magic. The set is great! Heats up quickly and to the right temperature. Love it!</li>
    <li> This has saved me $$$ every month that I didn&#x27;t have to go to the spa anymore. This was easy to use and had everything you need. Roughly as painful as waxing could be, but tolerable as long as you did it correctly.</li>
    <li> This wax kit was delivered so fast. I have used it once so far and must say that i absolutly love it.&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t been a fan of hard wax in the past but this time around i am def on board.</li>
    <li> Works great!! It is a worth your money. Definitely recommend buying it instead of paying it someone every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time last night. I have always been a shaver, but after my last long weekend away at the beach and I forgot to pack a razor, I swore never again. Shaving bikini area does require everyday maintance. That&#x27;s why I wanted to give this a try. Well, I won&#x27;t say it doens&#x27;t hurt. It does, but not that bad. So last night I tried it out first on my 17 yr olds legs, to get the hang of it. She was a willing participant and laughed through it the entire time. So this morning I watched the video that comes with it and gave it a try. Well, practice makes perfect. You do have to get the hang of it. How much wax to use, drying time etc.. Bikini areas of course are really sensitive, but all in all it went really well and I love how soft and smooth my skin looks. I did put on the pre oil treatment, just make sure you don&#x27;t use too much or the wax wont stick. I also used an after oil, but purchased argon oil as another review had recommended.  I do not know yet how long before the hair will start growing back. I will be happy to add to my review with more info when I can.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because shaving no longer appealed to me. I had never waxed in my life, but  since I epilate my legs and underarms I figured could deal with that kinda of pain. I think I read every single review and tried to follow all the advice, which was very helpful at the time. I now have my routine down and it takes me 30-40 mins to do everything! I start off warming the wax, I leave it on low with the lid on. I work out or clean the house, then take a shower (gotta start off clean you know), then proceed to dry myself off, thoroughly. I prep my floor with an old mat. This part I find to be crucial in fast and painless removal, really oil yourself well. I put enough where I&#x27;m not dripping  but I can definitely scrape some with my nail. I use baby oil infused with shea  butter I bought at my local dollar store. Then I just go at it. I start with the sides and make my way down. I&#x27;m a fan of the captain Morgan pose. I&#x27;m comfortable with having 2-3 strips going so I can pull one after the other. I used to have a mirror for those hard to reach places, but to be honest I find that \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; worked a lot better. If I oil the area well I find that I don&#x27;t even need to use the cooling gel. Yes, it works that well. After I&#x27;m finished I wash the waxed area with my Summer&#x27;s Eve (another great product, btw). Pat the area dry, put on my clothes and proceed with the rest of my day. I also wax my upper lip and eyebrows, although I did buy the beeswax pot for my facial hair. Great product, has worked so well for me in the last 9+ months (bought May, 2014) and will never switch to another product.</li>
    <li> This product is not all what it is cracked up to be. I had a lot of trouble with the application process. It was easy to go on but hard to come off. Since the kit didn&#x27;t come with cloth strips I bought some at the store,once I smeared the wax to my skin it would often be left with dried clumps. which wont come off unless I added hot water and picked at it for a bit. the wax hardly peeled off easy with the strips.</li>
    <li> This is really great. I bought this to do my own brazilians. It works awesome. You can peel the wax off, but I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s easier to use strips if you&#x27;re doing your girl bits.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is way better and more cost effective than going to the salon to get your waxing done. a super buy!</li>
    <li> What a great investment! Using this at home for perhaps 2 months has saved me over $70 in waxing services... because with this kit, you can wax anywhere! The different size wooden applicators are wonderful and the pre-epilation oil makes waxing not be so painful! I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I liked how this wax heated evenly and was easy to work with (granted, I am no novice to waxing). Unfortunately, I found this wax would miss hairs that other types (strips, honey, etc) would pick up at the same length. I also had some irritation and redness the next day with this wax.</li>
    <li> Gave it 4 stars because it takes a really long time to heat up to the desired temperature. Other than that performs beautifully.</li>
    <li> Best investment ever! I&#x27;m using it for 2.5 years now and just had to get a wax replacement and new spatulas. Works perfectly! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this kit! I used it for the first time last week and I must admit I am still smooth. The fact that you don&#x27;t need strips is also very nice and I wish that I had found this sooner!</li>
    <li> Phenomenal product and I am so happy with the results. 100% recommend this product to anyone who wants to wax at home beginner or pro its perfect for each skill level.</li>
    <li> Title says it all. Even came with a CD! Just wish they had included the strip cloth for easier self waxing.</li>
    <li> Good product. ..easy directions....fast delivery</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Love love love this kit. Affordable and convenient.  This was my first time doing self waxing and it has all you need. I have been able to do a few brazilian wax and have wax the armpits area about four time and still have a little bit left. I just ordered a refill.  Definitely pays for itself the first time.</li>
    <li> This kit worked out awesome for us. Waxing is kind of scary (or at least was for me) so I went to have it done professionally the first time and learn a bit from them. After that, it was nice to be able to do it at my own pace in privacy. The wax has a slight odor, not unpleasant and not heavily perfumed, which works just fine for me. We tried the extra oils and sprays it came with, but they didn&#x27;t seem to help and caused a little irritation for me, but many things do. The warmer itself heats quickly, setting it to high and keeping busy for a bit is all you really need before putting it to low to get started. Make sure to observe safety and sanitary concerns, learn about how to prevent ingrown hairs and never rush. I&#x27;ve used it on my bikini area, arm pits (with assistance) and eyebrows with no trouble, all multiple times, and still plenty in the pot. Will definitely get a refill when it runs out, it has become an essential :)</li>
    <li> This is cheaper than in a store..arrived nice and new and on time..works well..just like at a salon..</li>
    <li> Machine is great and priced good not to excited about the hard wax, it stays a bit wet I was looking for more of a harder wax I guess but it dose work and came with the purchase can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> THe lid to the waxing kit was broken but other then that it WORKS GOOD.</li>
    <li> The machine does not turn on at all. I try different plugs in the house just in case. I had this machine before for more than 6 years . I am guessing I received a false gigi waxing kit. :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this waxing kit with Gigi wax warmer and it has been going strong for over a year now.  It was definitely worth the small amount of money that I paid for it in comparison to paying a professional for the exact same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is the heat settings.  The unit has a sliding indicator from low to medium to high.  If you leave it directly on the &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; setting for an extended period of time, the wax will be too hot to use and you must shut it off to cool it.  To be able to use the wax, I recommend leaving it at the absolute lowest position without being off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to wax my underarms.  My hair is very stubborn when it comes to shaving,  but I get excellent results with waxing.  I got my underarms waxed twice professionally, then decided to purchase this product to save on money.  I LOVE IT!  I used it for the first time and I think that the results are even better than what I got at the salon.  The hard wax is very easy to use and not very messy.  I have sensitive skin, and was only a little red for about and hour after I waxed.  The oil and cooling gel help!  I love that I will be able to do little touch ups between full waxes now.  I never leave reviews, so this says a lot!</li>
    <li> I bought a smaller microwave version of this hard wax(gigi brazilian bikini wax) to try out and I liked it enough to get the bigger waxing kit but my kit arrived with a broken cap. The brown dome shaped top was cracked with a large piece broken off. Also, the \\&quot;pre epilation oil\\&quot; bottle was slightly unscrewed so that oil leaked out in the box. I haven&#x27;t tried the machine yet, but hopefully it works like the microwave wax. The microwave wax was amazing. It didn&#x27;t have a strong off putting scent and it got rid of all the hair with a minimum of pain. I decided to get this kit because I plan on using hard wax from now on instead of shaving. The hard wax left my skin feeling smoother and it got rid of the dark spots left over from shaving. The only downside to the microwave version was that there wasn&#x27;t anything to keep the wax warm so that it wouldn&#x27;t re-harden before I finished waxing. That&#x27;s why I thought the machine would be useful. I don&#x27;t think the cap has any purpose and I have oil I bought for the microwave wax to use so I don&#x27;t plan on returning the kit because it would be a HASSLE to pay more to exchange this if it at least heats the wax. So...hopefully the machine works. I heard that you could use a candle warmer to warm your wax too--maybe I should have tried that first. I would have been less disappointed. My advice would be to try an attractive candle warmer first, then you could keep it on a table as a decorative item when not in use &#x27;cuz the GiGi machine is kind of bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT&lt;br /&gt;The wax is messier than the microwave version. It works pretty much the same besides that though. The wax melts fast--about 20 minutes after turning it on. Before, I wondered what the \\&quot;collar\\&quot; that came with it was for. Now, I know that you need it because strings of wax get everywhere otherwise. Also, since this wax is more liquid than the microwave version, it&#x27;s harder to keep the wax from dripping down from where you placed it. I feel like it might pull less hairs than the microwave version too but that could just be that I need more practice using it. The instructional DVD that came with the kit was completely useless to me. I use the wax for my underarm and legs and the video talked about how to wax your clients private parts. Also, it was like a video from the 80s. I&#x27;d say skip watching the DVD. It&#x27;s intimidating and not very helpful since it&#x27;s about how to do someone else, not yourself.</li>
    <li> I have been going to beauty salon for waxing but after I moved, I have not found the perfect place that does it as good as my old salon. So I decided to get a wax kit and do it myself. If you have done it before, you will know what to expect. I researched for about a month before finally purchasing this kit. And waited another week to gather some courage to start! Here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. You know it will be messy, so cover your floors/carpet. Make sure you turn/twirl the wax around the applicator to minimize drip. If you know what you&#x27;re doing, it will not be that messy after all. The sleeve helps, but I don&#x27;t think there is a need to buy any extra since it&#x27;s reusable and you will not have much drip on it if you are careful.&lt;br /&gt;2. Have a stop watch/timer! Very important. The instruction says 30 seconds. If it&#x27;s not dry it will be messy, if too long, it&#x27;ll be too hard and painful. Stick to the timing. Do one area at a time if you are a beginner.&lt;br /&gt;3. We al know which is the worst part if you&#x27;re doing brazilian waxing. Be sure to hold firmly onto the back skin (you will be peeling towards you, so hold the part of your skin that is furthest from you) to make sure that you the wax peels off and in time. The part of ths skin is very soft and will tend to lift together with the wax.&lt;br /&gt;4. Wrap a scarf around your mouth if you need to scream. Feels like a security blanket ;)&lt;br /&gt;5. Be sure to have a mirror and a waste bin.&lt;br /&gt;6. Putting pressure on your skin with your fingers after the peel realllllyyy helps!&lt;br /&gt;It is a painful process, but it&#x27;s worth all worth it! Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> I really was on the fence about this one. The warmer itself has no issues. The device works quickly and comes with a cover. The other items in the kit is what did not work for me. The oils and cleanser included in the kit were not sealed or wrapped in anything. In transit, they leaked all over the box and got all of the other papers and items wet. It looks like they have empty plastic bottles and just fill and slap a label on it prior to shipping. Because of that, I have been weary to use the actual product so I can&#x27;t say if it works or does not cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In attempting to send it back and get another, I ran into issues with Amazon as it&#x27;s considered a biohazard product. Be weary about that if you plan on returning - you won&#x27;t be able to.</li>
    <li> Product is great, however, packaging is way below standards.  The cover arrived completely broken in half.</li>
    <li> THE Best wax i have ever tried .everything arrived in great condition and no oil spills ^^</li>
    <li> The wax didn&#x27;t work at all!! It has been the worse purchase so far.. don&#x27;t waste your money! I had to buy another wax and got the Moom Organic and it has been amazing! Go there instead of wasting your time and money.</li>
    <li> Comes with an informative DVD. I had never waxed myself before using this kit, and I had a very good first experience. I&#x27;ve only used it to wax my armpits so far. The wax hurts less than it does when I get waxed professionally (although the professional I go to claims to also use sugar wax), and I may be imagining it, but it seemed to last longer before the hair grew back. Overall I am very happy with this kit. It will save me tons of money, it was easy to use, and I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, thick, hair that I have tried, unsuccessfully, to wax before. I decided to give this product a try because of the multiple good reviews and the decent cost. It worked wonderful and paid for itself with the first waxing. What I liked best was no stranger had to see or touch my kibbles and bits, which is a major plus for me because I wanted to go completely bare but didn&#x27;t want to be so exposed.  If you&#x27;re new to waxing I recommend watching the included video, it helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> I thought it was pretty good. The warmer is really easy to use and I have no problems with it. Despite the reviews I read, I still found the hard wax to be be almost as painful as soft wax. It was easy to use at least.</li>
    <li> I have extremely difficult hair to get rid of, this worked amazingly well. I did bikini and part of my legs that my waxing strips didn&#x27;t take care of. It does take quite a while so make sure you have a few hours set aside. Quite messy and I&#x27;m sure my technique could use some work but I am very please with the results.</li>
    <li> best thing ever. yes it hurts but its pulling out all the hairs. i have never gotten a wax before and i think its easy to use</li>
    <li> I am not usually one to review but.... This is great I really like the hard wax. I did not buy this to do my woohoo but for my arms. Well it worked great. Just a couple of tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use the oil. It saves you from a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;2. Lay it on thick. It is easier and less painful to remove.&lt;br /&gt;3. Do not let it set on the skin for too long. This wax hardens fast and it hurts and gets messy to remove if you leave it on too long,it should be a little soft still when you pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked so nice once I got the hang of it. I did end up using 1/3 of the container on my forearms. I&#x27;m not sure if that was excessive or not. I have average arm hair. It was more than likely due to fact that I learned the thicker it was the less it hurt. I also used this on my face. It was not that bad. Again it was just fine hair on the sideburns, cheeks and brows. It def was not as painful as other waxes I have used in the past. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I am by no means a pro at waxing but I regularly wax my eyebrows and occasionally my legs. Decided to try this for swim suit season and really like it! I like my bikini line to be very clean and this wax worked really well. It was definitely a little awkward to apply on my own and there was some pain (as expected) but overall it wasn&#x27;t a bad experience. I have not had any irritation or ingrown hairs post-waxing which was a big concern for me. I did try it on my legs but found that it was difficult to spread an area large enough to be effective. I will try a soft wax for legs in the future. The actual warmer works great and I love that it has an adjustable temperature setting. The cord is pretty long too which is really nice. I don&#x27;t know if the pre epilation oil did much for me but I though the post epilation cooling cream did calm my skin a little. The dvd gives some good basics for waxing technique but is geared more towards a salon setting than at home waxing.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice kit and I love all the stuff that came with it but I was disappointed in how the wax worked. It didn&#x27;t do the job the way I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Ive purchased before but lost my old one when I moved.  So ordered another one and received it today.  However the one I received had the liquid caps unscrewed.  Getting a replacement so happy either way.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This waxing kit came with everything that it said it would, and in excellent condition. I am a first time waxer and this kit made it so easy! I highly recommend purchasing this kit if you are new to the whole waxing thing. I am very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use again. It&#x27;s extremely messy and hard to clean excess off. I don&#x27;t like it. I ended up going to a professional</li>
    <li> me and wax &#x3D; a perfect disaster. i had wax in places that shouldn&#x27;t have wax lol!! it was bad. I thought it would be much more user friendly but this is definitely for a professional not for a novice like myself. once was all it took for me to say never again.</li>
    <li> Amazing kit! Super easy to use for beginners!</li>
    <li> I need some practice but the warmer works very well.</li>
    <li> Will never go pay for a waxing as long as I have GiGi hard wax and my 20 yr old daughter to help me with the hard to reach places. This stuff works great. And the warmer that goes with it keeps the temperature at the perfect temp to not get burned and it never cools down to a harder state. Terrific product! Buying on amazon is the best. Much better price than my local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> its the best combo that I ever bought</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit a few months ago. I was a little apprehensive but used it anyway. This kit works well!!! I have no complaints. It&#x27;s pretty straight forward; turn on the heater, wait for the wax to heat up then apply to the area in question.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to purchase this item after the immense amount of positive feedback. I couldn&#x27;t be anymore disappointed wither the outcome. I&#x27;ve been waiting for an hour for my wax to melt with no results ( instructions gives an estimate to 20-30 minutes to melt) curious as to why I didn&#x27;t see any results I caucsioisly touched the inside of the warmer, and it wasn&#x27;t even warm; so the wax warmer is not working. And just in case you want to take a chance keep in mind this item can not be returned! I&#x27;ve never had such a bad experience with an item before. Good luck to those who purchase in the future and hope you have a different outcome.</li>

    <li> For those of you who usually go to a salon for waxing, this is a great cost-saving alternative. The wax works great! Though, I highly recommend putting down newspaper or a rag before beginning, as the wax will drip. My only complaint with this kit is that the wax takes so many hours to melt. I need to pick a day when I&#x27;ll be home all day just to make sure I have time to melt the wax.</li>
    <li> My old waxing kit was damaged by house guest.  At first I was disappointed but that feeling was erased when I received my new brazilian waxing kit.  I love it.  Much easier to use than my older one and really like that I don&#x27;t need wax strips.</li>
    <li> Worked really well. Smells pleasantly of cedar. Good sliding scale of heat on the warmer. The post wax cooling gel was helpful, but didn&#x27;t get any of the leftover wax off (it was a bit messy - wax strings and such).  I used coconut oil to remove the excess wax.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this is a great set my shipping was here fast and I love it and I know you would enjoy it too</li>
    <li> I used Sally Hansen Eyebrow, Face and Lip Wax for many years, and recently they changed the formula. The new formula is completely worthless, so I needed to try something new.  I ordered this kit and am beyond impressed. The difference between professional quality and drugstore quality (even with Sally Hansen&#x27;s old formula) is incredible. This wax is so much cleaner. It doesn&#x27;t leave tons of wax sticking to your face after use. Additionally, a little goes a very long way, with my old brand you had to be very heavy handed and slather it on. I really had to adjust my application, because all that is needed is a thin layer of the Gigi wax. Also, once you make the initial investment in the warmer, ounce for ounce this is significantly cheaper. You get 14 oz. of Gigi for about $11, versus 1.25 oz. of Sally Hansen for $7, when you factor in how much less wax is needed for the same result, it&#x27;s a much better bargain.</li>
    <li> Buy soft wax and strips instead. Hard wax is not a good idea for delicate areas . Its ok for waxing around your mouth/chin and arms if you are brave but not your legs or privates.</li>
    <li> it is so easy to use and compact enough to store. I&#x27;ve waxed almost everything with, and I have yet to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This kit gets the job done. However, please read the instructions very well. Not doing so, thinking you know it all can be painful!</li>
    <li> Works well, and I never have to shave again. I only wish it came with the paper</li>
    <li> It really works.. highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Amazing working perfectly</li>
    <li> This is used to waxing eyebrows, lip and chin areas.  This works very well and heats up the wax perfectly.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised - bit of a learning curve to use but DVD was very helpful . Much more economical and convenient than driving the 45 miles to nearest salon in our area.</li>
    <li> I was definitely looking for a waxing kit that would save me time and money from getting a Brazilian wax at a salon. After reading many reviews, I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s a great kit that comes with all the tools you need for a successful wax. The results are smooth and soft, definitely a great investment and an item that will save you money.</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with the actual wax warmer but can do without everything else....&lt;br /&gt;This video was very helpful, the bottles the kit comes with are wayyy to small and the actual wax is just ok.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only one I have used so far but it is very stringy and breaks every time I pull on it. I purchased another hard wax from satin smooth and ceperil to see if those work better. Overall for the money, a good buy.</li>
    <li> It works like a charm. It arrived sooner than expected. The quality is perfect. I couldnt be happier. The video is too graphic and the instruction is just ok. All in all, this is a great starter/pactice kit.</li>
    <li> Absolutely a great product for a beginner. Very happy with the products. Also very clear instruction DVD.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> .......... little tough n time taking :(</li>
    <li> I love this kit so hard!! I&#x27;ve gotten MANY Brazilians done over the years and when I moved, the new location didn&#x27;t have them offered anywhere. Then, when I finally found a place, it was close to $80 and she didn&#x27;t do a particularly good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has changed my life. It is incredibly easy to use. Everything comes with directions and there is a DVD that has a tutorial if you need it. I was semi confident in my non-existent skills (despite my many waxes, I have never actually waxed anything myself). Learning how to spread the wax evenly took some practice, but the wax itself was of very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this for years to come, and buying wax as needed. I may even buy a second can, of soft wax this time, so that I can do my legs as well!</li>
    <li> So Easy to use ! Great wax ! I&#x27;m brazilian and I can recognize a good product. All the instructions are well explain  !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beauty therapist and I fully recommend this product.</li>
    <li> heh, this product is.... i don&#x27;t know. If you really knew what you were doing, it&#x27;s great. The first strip or so, it&#x27;s great. Then as time goes on you realize it&#x27;s a lot of work waxing yourself &amp; if you don&#x27;t get every bit of wax up immediately you end up with little bits stuck to your skin and they&#x27;re really hard to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did listen to others and I let the wax melt for about an hour before using. I didn&#x27;t use the strips Gigi sells, but cut up cheap pieces of muslin (cotton) cloth &amp; used those. That worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I use this again? I just don&#x27;t know. If you had someone to assist you maybe. It is messy &amp; if you&#x27;re trying to do your legs you end up realizing it&#x27;s a lot of work.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time last week.  I am far from a professional.  I&#x27;ve dabbled with home waxing kits with disappointing results.  This kid did a PHENOMENAL job.  On the low setting, the wax is warm, but not painfully hot (even on sensitive areas).  The hair is gripped, but not the skin.  I was able to slowly remove the wax, sparing my skin the ripping pain, but still get all of the hairs.  I even did my underarms (and I&#x27;m usually too much of a weeny to do that!!)  Fantastic results!  I will be using this kit very often.</li>
    <li> Loooooooooooove it but beauty does hurt like a btch!  I waited anxiously for this.  It cam in a box which includes the warmer, cd, wax, waxing sticks, before and after oils, and one collar.  I ordered more collars and the muslin as well to go along with my shipment.  Using the hard wax without the muslin works, but I prefer the muslin.  This was my first time, so watching a video is a must!  I just you tube it.&lt;br /&gt;The wax didn&#x27;t take very long to melt at all, most were melted in 30 minutes.  The low setting does make the wax hotter than it should be, but i just blew on it to cool down a little before applying.  Test on your legs/armpits first!  I wanted to get an idea of different techniques to use before I went down there! I also prefer baby powder over the oil.  It just worked better. Twirl the stick around so the wax doesn&#x27;t drip and use the collar!  Wax is messy but it&#x27;s not a big deal if you aren&#x27;t being sloppy applying.&lt;br /&gt;This will hurt.. ALOT.  I would recommend taking a pain killer before hand and a glass of wine on standby.  I did a messy job, but it&#x27;s my first time so I am sure you will do it as well.  I just plucked out any stray hairs I missed.  Read as many comments and tips as you can.  They really do help.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ladies/gentlemen, don&#x27;t give up!</li>
    <li> The actual product is a must-have for any one who is into hair removal. Why have I been paying for other people to do it for so long.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad part was the lid was completely cracked when I received my kit. Although it is not a huge deal, it still should have arrived undamaged.</li>
    <li> I use this set to wax the eyebrows of all the girls in the house.  I have spent years paying $15 to have our eyebrows done professionally, so this paid for itself really, really quickly.  I wish I had bought one sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax takes about 45 minutes to heat up sufficiently.  And it didn&#x27;t take much trial and error to figure out the consistency and timing for perfect results.  I like that the kit comes with different sizes of sticks so that I could try each of them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the hard wax doesn&#x27;t require the muslim strips, I use them anyway.  I just find it easier.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a beginner like me; works for me fine at home.</li>
    <li> Finishes off too quickly</li>
    <li> Needs to add a sample of &#x27;Wax Off&#x27; with this kit.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;Like&amp;#34; the product.  The package came with everything listed and in excellent condition.  I purchased the product for myself so I could save some money on professional waxing.  It did a decent enough job of removing most puff the hair, and was not as painful as I had imagined.  The biggest issue I had was the wax was a bit runny once it was heated.  I followed the instructions to the letter, and could not get the wax to the same consistency shown on their video.  I had to turn off the wax heater and let the wax cool down.  After that there was a huge improvement and the process became easier.  Warning, it&#x27;s pretty messy and sticks to whatever it dries on. I did not experience any abnormal reactions on my skin and on a pain scale of 1-10 it was about a 2.  I would recommend this product to any guys looking to save on razors or professional waxing on legs and arms.</li>
    <li> this product is great. makes allot less mess. and yea love it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with cloth strips- extremely messy- not very easy to use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars just because this does get a bit messy at first, but once you get the hang of how to spread the wax it becomes easier. Make sure to put a towel you don&#x27;t like or use underneath you. Makes it much easier to clean up. The pre-oil is great and makes the skin smoother and easier to remove excess wax. Order extra collars :0)</li>
    <li> The heating unit part of this package is great. It does the job. BUT the wax that comes in this package is TERRIBLE. I had an allergic reaction to it that gave me horrible hives or a rash or something awful. I would recommend just buying the heating unit and sticks separately and then finding a better wax. It does the job but is really harsh on the skin. The 3 stars are only for the heating unit the wax itself gets 0 stars.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!!!! Wax is never too hot for me. Warms in a decent time.</li>
    <li> I love my Gigi! It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I think my warmer is broken. Even on low it seems to be on high heat.</li>
    <li> Used for the first time tonight. I will agree that the collars are a MUST and it has a little learning curve. I had a hard time finding that perfect temperature. I just turned it off and on to get it the right consistency. I did my own brazillian, and yes it was a bit painful but absolutely no more than at the salon.  Some of my hairs were too short to wax off, so a little bit remained.  I also did arm pits, and I found that MUCH more painful than public hair. Just my two cents.</li>
    <li> Awesome kit! the warmer works perfectly and its so easy to use  and set up</li>
    <li> this hard wax sucks I can&#x27;t stand it! I use the Sally Henson strip wax instead and it&#x27;s much easier on my skin and fasterrrrrrr. This wax is messy! warmer is great.</li>
    <li> This kit is great for beginners, but I wish there were a solution in here for dissolving wax in case you apply messily or too much.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit to get started. I have always used soft wax and it was always such a mess for cleanup, making sure to buy enough strips, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hard wax is surprisingly easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t pull on the skin as much as soft wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the sprays, the video is kinda funny (very immature of me), and it comes with just enough sticks for the wax pot.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the little kit it comes with :)</li>
    <li> Great price for a starter kit! Hard wax is much easier for those who are starting to wax, for waxing smaller areas, &amp; for sensitive areas. This kit says for Brazilian waxing but you could honestly use it anywhere on the body. Does a great job for ears &amp; nose on men... if you want to use on back or legs or larger areas, you will need to buy muslin strips for easier removal.</li>
    <li> this wax does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I have very coarse hair and thought it would be a problem waxing myself, but the wax just took it right off. I would recommend this to anybody because i know it would guarentee them great results. I will definitely continue using this product whenever I run out</li>
    <li> Love this. Really good for a beginner. Includes all the things you need. Overall great product.</li>
    <li> It takes longer than 10-20 mins for the wax to warm up like the instructions say. And when I opened the package, the oil had leaked everywhere!! but other than that it works great.</li>
    <li> excellent kit. Ive used it for months, and it works great, clear instrucitons, very good kit. I was also pleasntly surprised when i went to my usual place to get my eyebrows waxed, because i didn&#x27;t feel like doing it,  and saw they had the exact same thing i was using at home.</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple times to use this and it&#x27;s just not that great.</li>
    <li> I usually go to a professional for waxing, but it was starting to get way too expensive for me and I refuse to go back to shaving. I bought this particular waxing kit because of the great reviews. So far it has been working wonderfully. I use it for my bikini, armpits, and eyebrows. This wax will work with short hair, which is great because I don&#x27;t have to wait too long in between waxes! BUT... I learned the hard way, that you should trim before you wax your bikini area. Trim very short unless you want to end up slowly pulling hard wax off of your public hair, ouch!!! Anyway, this kit is great and has saved me a lot of money!</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase considering pro waxing was so expensive. It was interesting doing it the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Practice makes perfect.</li>
    <li> it took me a while to get to use to it but it was good at doing what was needed. You have to put the wax a bit thick so that you can pull all hairs.</li>
    <li> I believe this is a 5 star product. I gave it 4 because it didn&#x27;t get all my hairs but I loved this wax! I am 25 and have always shaved my underarms. I got upset with effects shaving would have so I wanted to try waxing. I actually had this kit for 3 months before I worked up courage to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I popped 2 Advils and then warmed all the wax for about 45 minutes. I washed my underarms and dried them. Then I applied the pre-epilation oil they have. After I applied that I applied baby powder. I then waxed in sections, the direction of my hair growth. Then RIP. Honestly, it didn&#x27;t even hurt. I am not sure if that is due to the Advil or all of my precautions to protect the skin. There were a few spots of blood but I expected that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only disappointing thing is that it didn&#x27;t get all my hairs. I plucked out the rest of them and I will wait another week to wax the other hairs that grow out since my hair grows fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased. Even as a first timer the directions were straight forward and the pain slim.</li>
    <li> BEST WAX I EVER TRIED TO BE HONEST IVE TRIED MANY THINGS AND PRODUCT TO GET RID OF MY COARSE HAIR. THIS REALLY DID THE TRICK I LOVED IT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY EASY AND PLUS THEY SHOW YOU HOW.ON THE SIDE OF THAT IT HURTS LESS THAN THE STRIP WAX. BUT BEST OF ALL THE PRICE I USED TO PAY ALMOST 200 DOLLARS FOR A FULL BODY WAX THIS TIME IT WAS ONLY 30 AND I GOT BETTER RESULTS THAN AT A SPA LOVE IT AND STICKING TO GIGI WAX</li>
    <li> This kit comes listed as a brazilian wax kit but you can wax anything with it. It&#x27;s super easy to use; you can change the temp settings and it&#x27;s basically fool-proof. It&#x27;s also great that you don&#x27;t need the muslin strips! After reading the reviews, I knew it could be a messy process so I laid an old sheet on the bed and kept a big sheet of wax paper next to me to toss the used applicator sticks on. The video they provide shows you how to wind the wax onto the stick to keep it from dripping everywhere. Definitely read the directions and watch the video but if you do those things I can&#x27;t see how anyone wouldn&#x27;t love this product. I got it from amazon prime for $30 which is less than half of one brazilian at a salon, plus after my first use I had barely used any wax at all so the tub it comes with will last a really long time.</li>
    <li> The package came exactly as I expected, though the DVD wasn&#x27;t terribly helpful for a beginner who knows nothing about waxing. I had to watch some youtube videos and stuff for more info. I cannot believe the price - half the cost of getting it done in a salon, nevermind with tip. The tub stretches pretty far, too, so you get a lot of bang for your buck. Warning: if you have never waxed yourself before, the first time can be HORRIBLE. It took me 3 hours, the majority of which was spent mustering up the courage to inflict massive pain on myself. Be prepared.</li>
    <li> It did very well I would recommend it for Brazilian waxes. It works very well on course hair! I would by it again</li>
    <li> So this was my Valentine&#x27;s Day gift! I have been wanting one so badly!&lt;br /&gt;And OF COURSE I love it!! Very easy instructions, even comes with a small little video to help you out if you are just starting to learn to wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not have to be only used on brazillian waxing, I used it on my arm pits and legs too!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the top that covers the waxing system was cracked.  Not just a little crack, but it was cracked from one side to the other side.  I would have liked to exchange it for another, but that wasn&#x27;t an available option.</li>
    <li> I NEVER got my package in the mail and it&#x27;s been over two month. No response from the seller, nada. I just got my refund which is really dissapointing because I really wanted to try this product out. This really doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star, it deserves none. Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s really not worth it it at all!</li>
    <li> Think of this kit as having the wax warmer only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax - too thin, does not spread well, difficult to remove. There are better waxes out there. 1 star&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Gels&amp;#34;/oils pre- and after application - full of parabens if you care, do not perform as described (useless, do not remove wax). 1 star</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought this waxing kit!!! I have never before been to a salon to have a professional brazilian done, and I have only ever used Veet wax strips to keep my vag hair tame down there. But about two months ago I decided to go completely bare forever after trying it once (using only Veet wax strips, OUCH!)...I workout most days, and I felt cleaner and fresher after my workouts with no hair to trap sweat and odors. I began my hunt for a product that would be more efficient at removing hair than the strips I was using. I stumbled upon a blog about DIY brazilian waxing, and the blogger raved about the GiGi Brazilian Hard wax! I must have read a hundred reviews via Amazon on this wax before deciding to purchase it. I was a bit worried because I have absolutely no experience with hard wax, but I watched a youtube tutorial prior to receiving my waxing kit (which showed the entire process, and the esthetician was performing her own Brazilian, so the vid was very helpful).  I also followed the advice of many of the reviewers on this site regarding warming the wax. I had absolutely no trouble waxing both my underarms and doing a full Brazilian (my a** hair included) in about two hours! I had very few bits of wax to clean off of my vag and underarms when I finished and a hearty slathering of baby oil took care of it all. I highly recommend the cooling gel. Other reviewers said it burned, but I foud it to have a refreshing sensation...kinda like mouthwash for your nether regions, lol! I love this hard wax. It removes EVERY hair! This will definitely be my go to waxing product for the foreseeable future. I will be waxing my eyebrows in a couple of days, and I know that I can expect great results!</li>
    <li> just arrive on time but the problem is after waxing my underarm theres a lot of black marks on my underarm..it takes time to heal, the only thing i want it is its so easy to use...</li>
    <li> This warmer makes waxing so much easier than heating up on the stove top.  I find the hard wax to work so much better than the soft wax and this heats it to the perfect temperature.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how easy this is! I have been spending so much money over the years to get my lip and eye brows waxed. The lip was very easy, but becareful with the eyebrow as the wax drips and if you are looking at the mirror upright it might drip on your eyelid like it did for me. Scary! I was able to quickly fix. I tried a bit of the bikini area, but will go at it another time when I master the skill of waxing a bit more confidently! I highly recommend this kit. So easy to use and stores nicely. Once you are all done just place back in the box. My only complaint: The prewaxing oil did leak during shipping. When I went to watch the DVD I couldn&#x27;t watch the video at first because the oil was on the disc. Once I figured this out I could watch it after wiping it down. Overall, good product for this price! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great kit for beginners!</li>
    <li> Works great. Harder to use hot wax on face without assistance, however.</li>
    <li> I love this wax it doesn&#x27;t irritate my facial hairs or skin it can get messy at times you just gotta know what you&#x27;re doing and if you do happen to get it on your fingers it takes awhile to get off but love the starter kit</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved this product! I was a little unsure about waxing (I have only ever waxed my eyebrows professionally) however it was straight forward and easy to use. I have tried many, many at home products (nair, nads, Sally Hansen etc) but either they left my skin irritated and/or still with hair! I tried the hard wax on my eyebrows first and there was NO irritation! I&#x27;ve since used it on almost every part of my body and has successfully removed my unwanted hair. I do find it is hard to wax my own legs, maybe a different wax would be better than the hard wax? The kit was complete with everything you need to get started, but a talcum powder is an essential for the wax to not stick. Shipping was fast and the product looks very professional! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Went to use this for the first time and it turns out it&#x27;s not really a &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34; kit - it doesn&#x27;t include the strips. So, I&#x27;ll update my review after I&#x27;ve actually used the product. I gave it 4 stars now because it looks to be pretty good quality and the instructions are easy to understand.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for the bikini line, lasts for quite a while, and does not hurt afterwards.</li>
    <li> I decided to save some money in waxing by doing it myself and this kit is a perfect starter package. The dvd is very informative. i recommend buying the numing spray as well.</li>
    <li> Okay, this review is based solely on the wax itself, not on the other components. As somebody who&#x27;s been getting hard waxes for several years now, I find this particular wax horrible and extremely painful. Some time ago, I purchased the smaller hard wax kit for sensitive skin (the wax was a light green color) in order to save time and $100 month I normally spent at the salon. I loved that wax, but wasn&#x27;t happy with the fact that I had to keep returning to the microwave to reheat. So, I ordered this. The heater/lotions/etc. are all great, but the wax leaves a lot to be desired. I have experimented three times with different temperatures and techniques, hoping it would produce better results, but no. One, it doesn&#x27;t pull out much hair--of course, you should expect to tweeze a few stubborn hairs after a wax, but with what this leaves behind, you cannot tweeze--far too much hair, even after multiple passes. Worse, it tends to break once you rip, leaving very small patches that must be ripped off separately--very, very painful. I&#x27;m confident that it&#x27;s not user error, because I&#x27;ve used other wax varieties with no issues. Perhaps this particular one just doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin? Either way, I will NOT be using this wax again. I hope to find a jar full of the green stuff I used to use.</li>
    <li> Works, came in great condition but it&#x27;s missing one of the bottles that was supposed to come with it!</li>
    <li> Great system to have saves you a lot of trips to the salon &amp; money !</li>
    <li> This is why I would NOT buy this after trying it out:&lt;br /&gt;1. Takes about 1h to heat up. This didn&#x27;t bother me too much.&lt;br /&gt;2. The big applicator is still too small. The smaller ones are useless. Worse than 1. but still good.&lt;br /&gt;3. This wax (the soft one) is darn sticky - the stickies thing I&#x27;ve ever experienced! I had to stop mid-process because I could not un-stick the applicator off my hand. Anyhow, could not use my fingers anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took pictures of sticky fingers, will post them. Tried for about an hour to wash that wax off - used soap (liquid/solid), alcohol and nail polish remover. Nothing works. Clogged my bathtub, need to call someone tomorrow. I am lucky to be renting, otherwise I&#x27;d had to pay for that. My place is a sticky mess. I can type because I \\&quot;dried\\&quot; my hands in paper towel and it did stick to my fingers. Will post pics of that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it one more try with hard wax (got one box separately) and will update this. So far, disaster. Forgot to mention - I used to do this all the time myself, with good, hard wax from Eastern Europe. Heated in a dedicated pot, using a nice, wooden kitchen spatula. I guess I&#x27;ll go back at improvising.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, there is something positive to say - it does remove hair nicely and it doesn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL. But it got too messy before I could finish so now I&#x27;m walking around \\&quot;half-done\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I give it 3 stars because I arrived late and cream did not taste Brazilian but the wax work very good.</li>
    <li> Great kit, includes everything you could need, perfect if you like hard wax. DVD was a bit graphic so proceed with caution if you plan on watching</li>
    <li> I have been using simple, reasonably priced HOT ZIP WAX for most of my adult life.&lt;br /&gt;While ZIP wax may sting, it removes superfluous hair very well. And, after waxing&lt;br /&gt;you do not grown back more hair than you waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fancy little Gigi Brazilian Waxing Kit on the other hand tells a fine tale--however--&lt;br /&gt;it is undesirable because of the following reason:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey.&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 45 minutes to heat.&lt;br /&gt;It does not include a cup in which to hold your selected amount of wax.&lt;br /&gt;It stings.&lt;br /&gt;It does not REPEAT DOES NOT REMOVE superfluous hair on first application.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, on its second application, it fails as well.&lt;br /&gt;And, hairs which were not noticeable prior to the application grow back&lt;br /&gt;course and black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like a refund on this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It is an inferior product, and of no use to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REFUND ME IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandra Ciccone&lt;br /&gt;A Valued Amazon Customer who buys from Amazon frequently.</li>
    <li> This is a good product with affordable price, easy to use but it would take a couple times for you to know when the wax is cool enough to rip off</li>
    <li> I LOVVE THIS FOR MY EYE BROWS ! I WOULD HAVE TO GO ONCE A WEEK FOR 12$ IT PAYS FOR ITSELF AFTER 3 TIMES&lt;br /&gt;AS FAR AS BIKINI GOES NONO LOL MABYE IM A WIMP  BUT I COULD NOT HANDLE THAT PAIN&lt;br /&gt;IVE NEVER HAD A WAX TREATMEANT MABYE IS Y BUT EITHER WAY ITS WORTH IT</li>
    <li> It is hard to wax your self for the first time and after you get it down it is awesome and I love the fax that I don&#x27;t have to pay 300 every month to get wax.</li>
    <li> In my naivete, having never been waxed before, I bought this thinking it would be quick and effortless. At first, it was. I started from the edges and worked my way down and toward the center -- as I progressed, it became harder and harder to get a good grip, which meant a lot of ineffectual hair pulling. Fast forward three hours, and I find myself with a sore, patchy beaver and a giant, too-thick wad of wax in one place where it wouldn&#x27;t come off completely and I recoated it thinking that would help. I had to wait for my roommate to get home and rip it off. By that point, because the wax was so thick and smeared so deep, it elicited an audible scream when it came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve at least been waxed before and know how to do it, this might save you some money. If this is your first time, I&#x27;d go get it done first. The instructional video shows another person doing the waxing, which isn&#x27;t especially helpful if you&#x27;re trying to wax yourself. Have a buddy around for jobs that need leverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: the instructional DVD makes a great White Elephant gift for non-work parties.</li>
    <li> By far the worst, messiest, and time consuming way to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good:&lt;br /&gt;I am a man using this to wax specific areas like chest, arms, etc. This completely removed the hair in the areas i wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;Smells Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Sticks to everything it touches.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves clumps of wax balls in hair that i don&#x27;t want removed.&lt;br /&gt;Takes time and many strips&lt;br /&gt;Dries too quickly to get an even surface area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my situation, like I said earlier i wanted to remove chest hair mainly so i did. It took out most every hair. Hopped in the shower after to clean the excess wax off. Cold shower, hot shower, doesn&#x27;t matter, this stuff will peel off your skin in wax ball clumps and migrate to other hairs , some that you might want to keep. So i hop out of the shower and realize that i have clumps of wax in hair i want to keep. Spent hours trying to get it all off. I couldn&#x27;t get hardly any off. Now I&#x27;m sitting here writing this review with clumps of sticky wax pulling on hairs i want to keep. It hurts, it&#x27;s uncomfortable and it&#x27;s irritating. Before you ask, yes i watched the DVD that came with it and followed the directions to a tee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAVE YOUR MONEY! SHAVE IT!</li>
    <li> Heated for 3+ hours yet it never reached the right temperature.  Soon as it was applied to skin dried up causing serious issues trying to get the wax off my skin, spent days using my nails, towel, and oil to get rid of wax reside, causing red blotches all over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been self waxing for over 20 years using microwavable products, never had issues other then getting wax on the microwave so I thought this would be a wonderful alternative.  What a disappointment!</li>
    <li> Received product fairly quickly, and used it today for the first time.  I was very happy with the warmer - Took about 20-25 mins on high to heat wax, I then set it to medium for a few mins and did my waxing.  I had no issues with the warmer or the wax.  I read a few reviews saying how bad the wax was - with hard wax you need to spread to the right consistency, let it cool slightly and pull it off before it gets to hard.  No problems - worked great.  I am a very happy consumer.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time and really likes the results(as do I!).  I honestly can&#x27;t give any other opinion than that(though she did try to use it on me...)</li>
    <li> I give it a 4 because there was a crack on the cover for the heater, other than that, it&#x27;s perfect! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The warmer alone is about 23, the wax is 14! So money saved! I waxed my sister&#x27;s lip, my cousins eyebrows, and my boyfriend even go brave and wanted to see what they were complaining about. Just one little patch of wax took off what looked like three layers of hair! That wax piece I pulled off was nothing but hair! I love love this! If your wanting to get a wax kit, look no further and it&#x27;s not hard to do to yourself once you get used to the inital shock value.</li>
    <li> worked so well and got the job done. would certainly recommend this to my friends and co-workers. great product for sure!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the hard wax. The warmer and other products work great. I find the soft wax (which I use with the warmer) to be easier to use and Controll.</li>
    <li> Went to cosmetology in high school and wanted a simple kit that I could just wax my own eyebrows with and maybe my legs on a special occasion... Got this and was totally satisfied until...... I saw there wasn&#x27;t any muslin strips... and realized this came with HARD wax that you take off by hand instead of with strips.... Since I havent had much experience with that kind of wax (and a mishap with &amp;#34;trying&amp;#34; it on my husband) I ended up having Prime deliver me some Gigi Honey All Purpose Wax along with some Gigi Muslin Strips.... Now that I got those things are going much better and the wax heater and before/after products work fantastically!</li>
    <li> It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the user had to be drunk as a skunk to use the system, but it works great!</li>
    <li> I use this waxing kit to wax my bikini line as well as my eyebrows and my lip hairs! it works great once you get enough practice and know what your doing!!  I Will say that it is very hard to wax your bikini line by yourself, hard to see all the area and hard to rip the wax off yourself. I love not having to pay $15 every two weeks for my eye brows! Def one of the best purchases Ive made!!  I only wish you could control the heat of the wax better, but overall not a big deal.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife. I&#x27;ll say she likes it because I haven&#x27;t heard a complaint since she got it.</li>
    <li> Would give it five stars but the lid was delivered cracked in half. Other than that it works great</li>
    <li> It was my first time waxing myself at home. I found it was pretty difficult. I didn&#x27;t get my hair out every application. It totally takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Great product!</li>
    <li> I use this product for maintenance after getting a wax at the salon. Definitely use a mirror and give yourself plenty of time. Make sure you trim the hairs or it&#x27;s quite painful. The wax has to cool completely before you yank it off or it won&#x27;t work and it will hurt.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as described. Easy to use. Will definitely take some practice to do more delicate areas, but still had success the first time. Quality item.</li>
    <li> Watching the instruction DVD is a must!  I watched it several times before I used the product.  Again, DVD is really useful.  It worked as advertised, and it appears to be well made.  I am very happy with the Gigi Products.</li>
    <li> I would say that this product works, but be prepared, it hurts! So unless you&#x27;re someone who can stand pain well, it is gonna be rather torturing applying the wax on and pulling it away from you. Took me quite a long time with a towel in my mouth to get it done, but i would say the result is good, really clean. But I will think twice to have to do it a second time.</li>
    <li> pure garbage dont buy thisss, i put it on my skin and try to take it off and it just didnt work i hate it</li>
    <li> I bought this so i wouldn&#x27;t have to pay the 10 dollars every two weeks at a nail salon. worth the money although the how to video is does have a naked women in it....</li>
    <li> Messy and not worth the money!</li>
    <li> I like it works good but it should include the wax remover clothes</li>
    <li> i love this!!! excellent product and excellent price. very please with what i payed for, highly recommend this wax kit, its great :)</li>
    <li> Good product for professionals but NOT for beginners!!!!</li>
    <li> Hard to remove on clothing if it gets stuck. Be warned</li>
    <li> I love being in the privacy of my home. This product is  convenient and so simple to use. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have tried this soft waxing strips from walgreens before and all they do is leave behind a sticky trail . Gigi waxing is awesssommmeee! I am not expert at waxing by any means but it is quite easy and shockingly painless. The kit is worth it to buy in my opinion to start out because the wax warmer is so much easier than melting it in the microwave. I will recommend to definitely use the oil before hand it helps with pain for sure. You don&#x27;t have to use this oil, any oil will do, but this one smells good :) The wax melts relatively quickly and I gotta say I didn&#x27;t think I would actually enjoy the experience of waxing but somehow it was kind of soothing. And being able to see those bastard hairs on the strip afterwards feels triumphant! I have been using it for about 5 months, no complaints so far :)</li>
    <li> The video is very graphic. This kit is for hard wax so do not buy the cotton strips. You are actually yanking the wax wen it dries. I think I let the wax heat too much - that&#x27;s the tricky part. It stained my bikini line.</li>
    <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t have a problem with this kit. Waxing hurts but if it looks good after than at least it was worth the pain.</li>
    <li> Love this, kit.  1000 times better than the at-home store bought kits/strips.  Great wax and easy to do.  A bit messy at first but you get the hang of it.  I&#x27;m sure next time will be a lot quicker and (hopefully) less painful.  Bikini waxes suck, but at least you are saved from the uncomfortable situation and $70 each time! Already paid for itself.</li>
    <li> So when I received my unit it didnt look like it was new but rather than going through the hassle of returning it, i decided to just try it.&lt;br /&gt;I have failed at horribly at home Brazillian waxing in the past, including using the GiGi Microwave hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works really well.  It is easy to pull and doesn&#x27;t ever get &amp;#34;too hard.&amp;#34; It flexes as you pull which isnt true of all hard waxes.  The wax is a bit runny/messy so you may want to invest in some collars though it&#x27;s not absolutely necessary (the kit comes with one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about an hour to do my arms and my entire area down there.  It was amazing! Yay for not having to shell out for Brazillians anymore - the cost of this is even less than one Brazillian wax with a Groupon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP - I had some numbing solution from a previous kit and applied that that first - this is a MUST! You need to order this separately, the kit does not come with it.  Then use the oil (which is included) right before you apply the wax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to waxing my armpits now. It makes them so smooth and the hair is growing back MUCH thinner. I don&#x27;t really recommend it for doing a home Brazilian unless you have a friend to pull the wax for you. I tried and I just could NOT do it. Still, this is great for my eyebrows and armpits.</li>
    <li> After reading 1.5 million reviews on this product, I decided to try it because my Wax Pass at European Wax had run out and I was in a quandary of where I was going to go. Since buying the pass, I had moved to a different area of town and I was NOT willing to buy another pass so I could drive 40 minutes plus for a wax!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I ordered it from Vitamins4Beauty, as they seemed like the best deal. When the package arrived, it was swathed in plastic; I soon found out why: the pre-epilation oil had leaked ALLLLLL over the box. Brilliant. (Of course I had read of this happening before, so it was a risk). The seller told me to send pics of the box to get a partial refund and all, but I haven&#x27;t heard any thing back. Yesterday I called the Amazonians who assured me that it would be taken care of!&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, someone who had posted a review had said that baby oil or coconut oil can be used in lieu of the pre-epilation oil, so that&#x27;s what I did. It was absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with a DVD (which is kind of icky,but I suppose one SHOULD watch it, but if you&#x27;ve been waxed before, you should be fine without it). I did not use the post gel because I felt that more coconut oil and a little silver gel was fine, plus some people said the post gel burned.&lt;br /&gt;If I could do it again? I&#x27;d buy the wax, the warmer and the popsicle sticks separately (I had to buy more sticks anyway because the kit comes with so few of them.) Yes, you have to use a new stick EACH TIME you dip it into the wax!&lt;br /&gt;The best thing was getting it done for myself without any help. Sure it was tricky and messy (and at one point I wanted to just give up and go back to getting it done) but when I was finished, I was amazed with myself. Empowered even.&lt;br /&gt;Remember-you MUST use some kind of oil (or it will hurt like a bitch! (I accidentally missed a few spots with the oil). I used organic coconut and it was fine. Just a thin coating of oil, wipe the excess off with a tissue. (Yes, I&#x27;ve readreviews hating the oil because the wax couldn&#x27;t grab the hair, and my conclusion is that these people gobbed on WAAAY too much oil.)&lt;br /&gt;Also, there was some bleeding, but this is probably because my skin hadn&#x27;t seen hard wax in a long time. So there it is. So, in summary, buy the warmer, the wax, the collar and the sticks. And some coconut oil, if you don&#x27;t have any already.</li>
    <li> I am almost done with cosmetology school, so I figured it was time I got myself a wax pot. The pot itself works just fine! The only thing I am not 100% happy with is the wax itself. It is a hard wax, but it never really.....hardens. The wax is always sticky, even if you have been letting it harden on the skin for 10 minutes. It gets very messy. I would suggest getting a different can of hard wax.</li>
    <li> I have been using soft wax and strips for years and have never been totally happy with the results. Decided to try this kit to do a brazilian on myself for the first time. It does take patience and some good positiong to get the hairs but this wax is so effective. Make sure you have a light, a good mirror and time, rushing will just lead to frustration and make a big mess. So far, i&#x27;ve done a full brazilian, both of my arms, and my face! and haven&#x27;t even used half of the tub. what a great value! Its already paid for itself.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure the wax forms a ball when you twirl it on the spatula. If it runs off very fast, its too soft.&lt;br /&gt;-Do small sections and put enough wax to make a thicker layer than you would use with soft waxes.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure to use the pre epilating oil, it helps a lot! Ripping pubic hair is never painless but this helps.&lt;br /&gt;-While the wax cools on your skin, use your fingernail to flip up a small tab to pull. Tap the wax to feel if its set (it will start to look dull), don&#x27;t let it cool too much or the wax will break off (this can get pretty painful if it happpens downtown).&lt;br /&gt;-Any oil will help get the wax off. I use coconut oil (my regular body moisturizer). rub into skin and the wax flakes off easily.</li>
    <li> For home purpose very good.Easy to use &amp; It works perfect. Cheap also compared to other products in market.Must buy</li>
    <li> It is really convenient to do waxing at home on my on time.  This is really easy to use.  A bit runny a messy at first but you get used to it. No need to use cloth strips with it.  Just apply wax, let it dry, then rip it off.  I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother it.  Love this stuff. Grabs even the hard to get hairs.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that the warmer heats up rather quickly. The wax is really good and the price was outstanding.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a deal! I bought this kit thinking that even if I got one full wax out of it, it would be cheaper than going to a spa and paying to have it done. I&#x27;ve now done 3 bikini waxes and 2 lip waxes and still have half the wax leftover. The first time was quite the learning experience. It is quite messy when you are doing it yourself and figuring out the best techniques but hang in there, its worth it! I turn the warmer up all the way to the hottest setting until it melts then turn it down really low and wait. Don&#x27;t try to rush it when getting the wax the right temperature, it is worth it to not have it too hot that its uncomfortable but not too cool that it dries/hardens quickly.</li>
    <li> Wax works great, but it seems to go fast, especially if you&#x27;re really hairy and/or have thick hair that grows back relatively fast. You definitely need to have the time and patience to make this work, but overall it&#x27;s a good deal for what you receive.</li>
    <li> Definitely a new experience trying to wax myself, but it was a good investment. In the long run, it will pay off.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome kit! Even as more of a beginner to waxing, this kit was a breeze to use. Although it comes with a hard wax that doesn&#x27;t require strips, I highly recommend using some sort of strip when waxing more private areas. It helps a lot, especially when doing it on your own! I have extremely sensitive skin, and the day after waxing, I had no irritation or swelling or even redness! Make sure to use some oil before waxing; it definitely makes the process easier. And I second taking some pain reducers beforehand!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this kit! Looking forward to purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> This is the only wax i can use. Once you get the hang of it (which doesn&#x27;t take long) it is easy to use. The video actually did help even though it was targeted towards businesses. Amazingly its not as messy as i thought it would be either. The hardest part of this wax is making sure you get it to be the right consistency which can be hard at times. I have thick hair and shaving irritates my skin tremendously so I&#x27;m glad this actually works. If you have thin fine hair you won&#x27;t even have a problem getting your hair to come out at once. I have to go back and tweeze at times but its still better than shaving</li>
    <li> the pre-epilation oil leaked all over everything inside the package. it was even in a ziploc inside the package, but it still leaked out. not worth the effort to return the entire thing - the shipping  box the kit came in is in good shape but it is soaked with the oil and I don&#x27;t have anything else I can use.</li>
    <li> really liked this productlove this. i was new at this but its great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this item.... It&#x27;s professional and does the job...</li>
    <li> i&amp;#34;m order adress is korea.&lt;br /&gt;cap is broken...&lt;br /&gt;so..so..&lt;br /&gt;The well operation..&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I read reviews before purchasing. I watched the dvd that came with this kit. It was very informative. I like the fact that you don&#x27;t need cloth to use. I didn&#x27;t have any issues warming the wax. It does take awhile. If you are in a hurry, this is not a quick job. It can be messy. I&#x27;m getting better at it though. Don&#x27;t forget to put the pre-wax lotion on!!</li>
    <li> Heats great ! Awesome Wax</li>
    <li> Great gift for daughter</li>
    <li> Love this warmer and kit. The warmer and wax are great. I love the tree sizes of applicator sticks. Instructional DVD is not very helpful. I use this kit to give myself brazilian waxes and would recommend finding a video just for that on youtube so it can show you how to get those tricky areas by yourself. I like the pre-epilation oil but the post-waxing gel is sticky and not ideal for irritated pubic areas. I prefer using an oil (such as grapeseed, argan, avocado or vitamin e oil) to remove left-over sticky wax and to soothe the area, but don&#x27;t forget to cleanse the area later with an astringent which I then follow up with more oil. The only real complaint I have is that it only come with one collar.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase this. I watched the DVD and am glad I did because this kit doesn&#x27;t use the paper strips. I&#x27;ve used it twice now on the bikini area, and once for armpits and upper lip. Make sure that you put a thick layer on so that when it&#x27;s ready to be pulled off, you have enough &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; to grab. And be prepared for the wax to drip off as you are applying it and have paper towels or tissues ready and underneath where you are so it doesn&#x27;t drip onto your floor/carpet. All-on-all, well worth the money, but it takes longer than going to a salon, but I can do this now when it&#x27;s convenient for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found you!  I&#x27;m a really private person, so I really don&#x27;t need to have strangers down there waxing me.  It&#x27;s easy to use, takes maybe 20 mins for the wax to heat up, and the wax is easy-on easy off.  What more could you ask for!  Plus, this wax lasts forever!</li>
    <li> the best Brazilian waxing kit ever. easy to use, and the wax pulls every single even the shortest hair out. I love the pre wax oil and the after wax cooling gel. The oil makes the wax easier to pull with less pain, the gel cools down the skin reduce the redness after wax. I have never used a self waxing kit that work as well or even better than the ones i&#x27;ve done in the waxing stores. I definitely recommend it. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews here that some people compliant  about got the wax all over their fingers hard to clean off. I recommend wear a pair of tight disposable gloves. That will get the job done and not get your fingers dirty at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll try to make this review as short as possible. So it took me a while to use the kit because I&#x27;m a chicken. I ordered it from Amazon and it arrived quickly and packaged nicely. I bought some extra rings for the warmer like other people recommended. I also bought the wax remover and the pain spray from my local Sally Beauty. Sally also sells this was kit but is like $20 extra.&lt;br /&gt;I basically followed recommendations from other reviewers. I&#x27;ve gotten Brazilian wax before (at the salon) but never did it myself. Even after going to the same person all the time, it&#x27;s still an embarrassing situation every time. And my hair grows back kind of fast for the average waxer so I decided to do it at home to adjust my budget.&lt;br /&gt;Using the pain spray and the pre-wax oil makes this job a lot painless than what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Now, even though this kit says no strips were needed, in my opinion the job would be quicker and cleaner when using the muslin strips. So that&#x27;s going to be my next purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional and yet this has been such an easy item to use. Such a money saver and the wax lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> The switch/lever for the unit popped off the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Got it but the lid is broken and some of the oils were spilled and it takes about an hour to heat up really disappointed</li>
    <li> Bought this from Sally&#x27;s. Thw warmer is okay but the wax and strips are HORRIBLE! It&#x27;s impossible to take off of your skin once the stripdoesnt remove it! Very painful.</li>
    <li> I bought this &#x27;cause I was tired of shaving.  The wax is ok.  The warmer is great.  No more razors for me. Only gave it four stars because Cirepil makes way better wax, but the warmer and lotions are great.</li>
    <li> The spell has been broken, I tried waxing for a month or 2...not worth it. Glad I tried it though.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit &amp; awesome deal.  Saves so much money as well as the inconvenience of going to the salon.  LOVE this stuff !!!</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly. Easy to use. Works as well as at the spa and far less expensive.</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to.  just wish someone else would pull off strips lol</li>
    <li> This product is pretty hard to use if you do not have experience with wax, watch the DVD and use a lot of towels! It can be very messy.</li>
    <li> The gel is the reason I gave this product 1 star. It sticks to my skin and caused me to bleed when I tried to pull it out. I work at a nail salon and do waxing for my clients everyday.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for the wife. She says the kit is awesome.  Covers everything that is needed and is easy to use</li>
    <li> I never thought that i could to do a wax by myself, but i can!! I loved, never more i will spend a lot of money for go to a place to do wax...perfect!! And the oil pre depilation is perfect too, help a lot, one time i forgot to use the oil and it wasn&#x27;t too good as with the oil..</li>
    <li> Awesome and effective</li>
    <li> Love this, I also use it on the face.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing kit! The Brazilian wax is so painless and the video provided was very helpful. I saved a lot of money using it. The heater was perfect. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> My husband and I did my pubic hair together...and yes it does work and look nice ( after going over everything twice!)  but it was not nearly painless as advertised.  It hurt! But, I have also never waxed before.... But I am a grown woman and was biting a pillow and trying not to cuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, no pain no gain, I just hope the hair stays away long enough for it to be worth it.</li>
    <li> I just tried this kit yesterday. I usually get my Brazilian done at a salon, but wanted to try this because monthly waxing was just too costly. My cousin referred me to this kit.  She gave me some really helpful tips that I would like to share: (You can basically read this and skip the DVD) -Before you plan on waxing, place the wax in the warmer for at least 1 hour on High to melt it -Once it&#x27;s all melted, set it on medium so that the temperature is comfortable when you wax -Shower before waxing so your pores are more open, making the waxing easier on you -Bring a tub of ice cubes or an icepack in a ziplock bag, you will want to cold press the strip of wax you&#x27;ve laid to speed up the process -Lay a towel underneath you to keep the area clean, this process gets messy -Grab a cosmetic mirror, this will allow you to point it down where you probably won&#x27;t be able to see -Leave a &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; where there is NO hair at the opposite direction of the grain, this will allow you to pull the wax off easier  My thoughts: -Love how easy it was to use. Directions were on point. -Messy, but well worth it. This product pays for itself in the first use. -Honestly, doing this myself with the hard wax was the most PAINLESS Brazilian wax I&#x27;ve ever experienced -Only downside, I was mad that the cover to the wax warmer arrived broken in half</li>
    <li> perfect, just as described</li>
    <li> JUst received again the deliveryu sucks no signature needed they just leave it in the dorr other than that awesome</li>
    <li> This is so far the best waxing kit I brought, its good quality, the hard wax is no need for waxing strips, you wax off the wax itself. You would think the whole waxing hurts, I was terrified at first, but it&#x27;s PAINLESS. Mind you I have very sensitive skin, and a pinch hurts me but this is way worth the money! If you want to save moment on bikini, Brazilian, eyebrows, armpits, leg, any type of waxing I recommend this one &amp; it&#x27;s cheap compare to other ones!!</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW. I am kicking myself. For YEARS I have been going to waxing salons (some downtown with terrible parking etc.) and I have wasted hours of my life (last 7 years) making those appointments. Let&#x27;s see....it takes 20 minutes to get there, 10 to park, 5 to wait for your aesthetician, another 45 minutes to an hour to get your brazilian, 10 min to check out and 20 minutes to drive home. That&#x27;s about  2 1/2 hours of my life 12 times a year for the last 7 years I wish I could get back. I got this kit in the mail at 6:30pm and ran upstairs to plug it in immediately. (I was done at 8:30pm) I only read enough directions to see that I needed to put the cardboard ring (included) around the wax container before I plopped the whole thing down in the metal heating tub and moved the switch over to high. I waited about 35 minutes before I couldn&#x27;t wait any longer. I didn&#x27;t even bother with the DVD. I&#x27;ve watched those ladies at the salon rip the hair off of my nether regions so many times I could do this with the lights off--and I am NO pro by any means. I took one of the smaller sticks and turned the chunk of wax still unmelted in the middle, but the surrounding hot wax was just fine. I then turned the melting pot down to medium, and I believe the secret must be to use the large rounded sticks they use in the salon. I didn&#x27;t use the ones that came with the kit. I purchased the larger rounded ones and simply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. dipped&lt;br /&gt;2. twirled the medium to hot wax in a ball on my rounded stick (so as not to string it everywhere)&lt;br /&gt;3. pulled my skin upward and thickly slathered a perfect bandaid sized wax slather on me over the hair&lt;br /&gt;4. tapped the wax until it was cool (it turns a dull color and isn&#x27;t sticky)&lt;br /&gt;5. pulled up a tad bit of the end and (pulling my skin taunt) ripped up against the hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I DID use the pre-wax oil about 3 minutes before I started, so that may have helped with the pain. BUT on a scale of 1-10 at the salon with 10 being the worst pain ever, I&#x27;m usually at a 9 1/2 at the salon. I would say my pain level using this kit.....a TWO.&lt;br /&gt;TWO ladies and gentlemen. I&#x27;m not EVEN joking. Why have I never done this before? Not to be crude but they say when its your &#x27;time of the month&#x27; waxing hurts like hell. Well- its my &#x27;time of the month&#x27; and my pain factor is a TWO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also.....this took me 30 minutes to do a full brazilian. From the time I sat down on the floor with kitchen wax paper spread all around me-- to smooth and bare walking downstairs to tell my husband I&#x27;m never going to another salon EVER. That will save us about $75 a month and hours of my life. I&#x27;d say the 14 oz. can (I barely used any) will last about 30 waxes plus. Also the redness factor is a 1/3 of what it usually is at the salon. I&#x27;m somewhat still in shock that this $30 at home waxing kit just blew my mind. Anyways, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a 1st timer. Id recommend it for someone who pays attention to their aesthetician while getting waxed and can pretty much mimic her technique.ng the worst pain ever, I&#x27;m usually at a 9 1/2 at the salon.

    <li> I just spent 2 hours waxing legs and bikini area. Everything worked as described. Hair gone and with little pain using the pre-wax oil. I&#x27;m excited to see how long my legs stay hair free. By the way, I have never waxed my legs or bikini area or paid to have it done. This was a great experience.</li>
    <li> The heater works perfect, the creams are the once you need to begin, the DVD really help with the instructions and the wax is one of the best for delicate areas.  At around 25 minutes in the HI level the wax is melt as indicated by the instructions, then in the low level it keeps the wax warm enough to be use.  when using it, take wax from the border of the can because in the center it will be too hot probably, in that case just blow the wax in the stick a little bit.  What you will have to include in your order is some extra sticks because it come with only a few, and for the future you will need them anyhow.  The hard wax can be removed without the use of the clothes pads, so I only use the clothes if I am gonna use a wax that is not the hard wax.</li>
    <li> The video was great and product was great for my sensative skin. I would recommend this to anyone. Thank you</li>
    <li> Ok, so I got tired of spending my money on $75 wax treatments, so I figured I would give this a try.  It worked just like in the spa.  It did not hurt that much ripping it off.  The only issue was getting in the behind area :P.  If you are not skilled in this, you will struggle a bit to become acclimated in the methods of waxing.  Wax may remain on you.  However, I will say its worth the money.  Also, you might want to become skilled in how much wax to use.  You could easily get carried away.  Its sort of messy as well, so be careful.</li>
    <li> I love gigi products they are always fantastic however this came with 2 bottles of oil and lotion they are not sealed so I received my products and there was oil spilled in the box it was a little upsetting to find everything soaking in oil however the warmer works great and the product does exactly as it says the video was a great tool to watch as well.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, wayyy cheaper and less painful than the salon.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the title says, great for BODY waxing. Don&#x27;t attempt to use this on the face for precision waxing, IE: Eyebrows, It was an absolute fail; it instantly dries so leaves no room for error when trying to be precise.</li>
    <li> I was trying to save money by doing it myself. And let me tell you that it&#x27;s not worth the hassle and mess. Won&#x27;t be trying this out again!</li>
    <li> It works great! Saves me a lot of money and it is so much easier to just do it at home.</li>
    <li> Rather just go get waxed professionally. Less painful, SOOOO hard to get the dry wax off on your soft areas , and it hurts like hell!!! The wax off cream DOES NOT WORK I PROMISE. Not even a little. Better off just leaving it there it&#x27;s too painful to take off,</li>
    <li> I bought this system to give myself Brazilian waxes, but it ended up being too painful to go past the bikini line (it felt like ripping duck tape off of sunburn). BUT, it works great on waxing my legs painlessly! Now I have silky smooth legs for weeks! I liked it enough to order one for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this waxer, the warmer is great. I couldn&#x27;t imagine how much of a pain in the butt it would be to use a microwave waxing kit, since the wax needs to be at the \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; temperature for the least painful wax. Also, I did not have an issues with wax being left behind (so no need for the wax-off spray) and it was not messy for me if you keep it at the right temp.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit yesterday received it today. I was so happy I didn&#x27;t have to wait sooo long to get it. Great product too, the only downside is it didn&#x27;t come with the strips so you would have to buy them separately but other than that great kit</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful. Heats up to whatever temp you want, with the three choice option. I like the wax.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic!! I love love love this kit and will be using it for a long time! It&#x27;s easy to use and the dvd was very instructional ( make sure the little ones arent around) lol I recommend however to get waxing strips, they say it isnt required but it&#x27;ll save you a lot on pain and a lot on wax lol trust me, when that wax hardened and i pulled down there, ooooh not so good, but when i put the strip over it i got 80 percent more hair off, nice and smooth for my boyfriend oh yeah lol</li>
    <li> This was my very first wax experience ever.  It took me 2 hours to do my underarms and bikini area..  :). But once I figured out the amount of wax and the consistency it needed to be it got very easy, that and I started doing smaller areas instead of larger.  I could not believe the results, super smooth and small red bumps that went away within a few hours, which i expected given my bikini area is sensitive.  I highly recommend this product and make sure to have towels down before you begin.  I had a couple of drips in the beginning, mostly on myself though.  I am now a hard wax fan!!  Oh one last thing, it did take about an hour to melt the wax in the warmer.  So be prepared for that your first time with this kit.  Still love it!!</li>
    <li> It did not take long for my package to arrive. My oil was not closed all the way and the lid was cracked pretty bad. I have been waxed professionally and it ended badly. I was over charged and had an allergic reaction to what ever was used. I then tried the moom organic wax. It was messy, still very painful and it ended up breaking my hairs in half instead of waxing off. This was on sale, for the price, it is AMAZING!! It is much less painful. Extremely easy to use. It only took me a quarter of the time it usually takes to wax. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> this says it is a hair removal kit but i guess the one i got the forgot the &amp;#34;magic hair remover&amp;#34; i tried the regular facial hair remover by gigi and it did better than this</li>
    <li> I actually use this wax product for my eyebrows, the product was actually easy to use, painless and aso has comes with DVD instructions</li>
    <li> I bought this originally for a brazillian wax because it was getting to expensive to keep getting it done. It ended up being super messy and scarey to put it down under. I was comfortable with doing my underarms and sideburns. Worked awesome!!!!  When I get brave enough I will try the brazillian. I will probably need help though since I dont see how we can do these ourself.</li>
    <li> This Brazilian waxing kit is professional and effective.  It was easy to handle and I am extremely pleased.  I will be purchasing again, soon.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> it sounds weird but this wax pot changed my life I work odd night shift hours and have dark coarse hair that needs to be waxed often, it was impossible to get to the salon regularly so I gave this a try I am soo happy I did I highly recomend using the &amp;#34;hard wax&amp;#34; tins that do not require strips it is sooo easy and virtually painless for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> This is the third kit I&#x27;ve purchased. All my friends and family got it. Best best best ever and everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> The warmer seems to run a little hot.  I have to keep it at low to get the right consistency and it takes forever to heat (hour+).  I tried turning it up to melt and then back down but it takes just as long to cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax though is great.  Much easier to use and less messy than my previous wax that I used with muslin strips.  I like that there is less waste with hard wax.  My first time using this I went straight for a Brazilian which I haven&#x27;t done in years and then only professionally - it was great!  Much less painful than what I&#x27;ve experienced in salons.  You need to apply somewhat thick layer (or two thin layers one over the other) to fully coat the hair and let cool completely before removing for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pre-epilation oil is key!!!  If you don&#x27;t use it, prepare for much more pain!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was terrified for what I was using it for being my first time but hey this made it easy! Place and pull that&#x27;s all there really is to it. A woman posted a tip to use baby oil to remove access wax and yes that works! I did however use the Gigi wool strips with it for me it&#x27;s less mess and easier to get a &amp;#34;pull tab&amp;#34; but it works great with or without them. O if you by chance get a bit clumping and can&#x27;t pull it add more on top and redo the procedure and it&#x27;ll come with it :) also if its your first time like me take a Motrin and use the Gigi relief gel for redness and irritation I swelled a bit due to my area wasn&#x27;t used to it but day later I was fine. Totally worth it! I bought more for next time!</li>
    <li> I have never waxed myself before and this kit is so perfect!  If you had had waxing done and are familiar with the process this kit will help you get those results at home.  There is some level of technique involved though. After reading all the reviews here on Amazon and watching some videos on Youtube  I also enlisted my husband to help. SO before you throw hot wax on yourself do some research. The instructions included are just ok.</li>
