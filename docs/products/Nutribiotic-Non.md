      <li>It may be pretty close in price, so go for this good stuff</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect cleanser, especially at the bathroom sink, for it&#x27;s mild cleansing without any strong scents.</li>
      <li>It is a very mild soap-free detergent skin cleaner.  </li>
      <li>It is a gentle cleanser that is easy on the skin, but effectively cleans.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled when I found I could order this large bottle to refill my dispenser.  </li>
      <li>It is a fabulous all-over cleanser.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a member of Amazon Prime and am supposed to get free delivery within 2 days.</li>
      <li>WELL AS BING FRAGRANCE FREE (ASTHMA),</li>
      <li>MY WIFE HAS CELIAC AND THIS PRODUCT IS GLUTEN FREE</li>
      <li>It is also very economical.</li>
      <li>So I just fill it into the original pump bottles</li>
      <li>This original version is cleaner rinsing than its &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; sulfate-free sibling.  </li>
      <li>I bought this to clean the gel liner for my prosthetic.</li>
      <li>Excellent cleanser, especially for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product for a couple of good reasons - it is fragrance free and it is a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>

      <li>Very gentle.</li>
      <li>thanks, Amazon!</li>
      <li>I use so much of it that it is definitely better to buy it in bulk and refill the smaller dispensers.</li>
      <li>Since Amazon does not sell this directly and it is relatively heavy to ship, it is best to get from a vendor that offers free shipping when combined with other health care products for a minimum purchase amount.&lt;br</li>
      <li>;  But it&#x27;s not heavily scented at all, because I am sensitive to strong smells</li>
      <li>REALLY?  </li>
      <li>Amazon, you really need to consider another source besides UPS.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for ages, ever since I discovered it at Whole Foods.  </li>
      <li>I use this for my whole body.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser works well, has no sodium laurel sulfate, and is totally fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>It has a light, unobtrusive scent that doesn&#x27;t follow you around all day long.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use normal soap, not only can it have gluten, it&#x27;s usually full of all sorts of chemical junk.  </li>
      <li>Recommend it highly for anyone who needs an unscented skin cleanser.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>If my sons have diaper rash, washing them with this will clear it up FAST.  </li>
      <li>I gave some to my daughter to use on her sensitive skin</li>
      <li>skin type is sensitive, medium oily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am still searching for something &#x27;natural&#x27; that cleans, won&#x27;t give dryness, won&#x27;t leave its residue (layer of chemicals) on skin.</li>
      <li>Adding a high quality essential oil to it for shower gel works well too.</li>
      <li>I buy this stuff in the big bottle from Amazon because it is sometimes hard to find in brick and mortar stores, and I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>the 4 packages being delayed, there is no expected delivery date.</li>
      <li>This is the only soap my sensitive skin has touched in my home for 4 years.</li>

    <li> If you have allergies, you know how difficult it is to find products that do not make you itch, sneeze, or break out in hives.  This is the product for you.  I use it all around the house and even take it in a small plastic container to use when I am in public settings.  It is a gentle cleanser that is easy on the skin, but effectively cleans.</li>
    <li> Cleans and lather wells. Great smell. Only downside is the price. Why so pricey?</li>
    <li> This product I have used for years.  It cleans without leaving residue or causing your skin to dry out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 6 years since my cancer diagnosis.  I started using this to use a chemical-free soap and have stayed with it through the years.  Very gentle.</li>
    <li> Love this soap you can even use it on your face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this skin cleanser for 20 years and just love it. I had always bought it at Whole Foods and when I found out that my Whole Foods is not carrying it any more I was not a happy camper. But I found it on good ol&#x27; Amazon. And what is even better: it comes in a 1 gallon container which is so much better for the environment. So I just fill it into the original pump bottles my former Nutribiotic skin cleanser came in and - voila! If you don&#x27;t have former bottles, then you can buy one (at Amazon?) and that would look even prettier.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE HAS CELIAC AND THIS PRODUCT IS GLUTEN FREE AS WELL AS BING FRAGRANCE FREE (ASTHMA), ALL IN ALL GREAT CLEANING SOAP.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap my sensitive skin has touched in my home for 4 years. It&#x27;s all I trust. There is nothing else like it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this formula since last century.  It is a very mild soap-free detergent skin cleaner.  It has the faintest of scents from rosemary and peppermint so it is not truly fragrance-free but it is so slight as to be an insignificant masking scent.  This original version is cleaner rinsing than its &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; sulfate-free sibling.  The other version replaces the sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) surfactant with C14-16 olefin sulfonate which turns out to be even more irritating than the SLES so is a dubious improvement.  Unless you have some unlikely allergic reaction to the SLES, this is a better formulation.  I refill the standard sized bottles until their pumps give out (after several years).  It does take some time for the product to pass through a funnel, though, so get a tall one.  You can also get a gallon sized pump from Nutribiotic or other sources.  That might make the transfer easier.  Since Amazon does not sell this directly and it is relatively heavy to ship, it is best to get from a vendor that offers free shipping when combined with other health care products for a minimum purchase amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2017 Edit:  It looks like Amazon has Prime Shipping on this now even when purchased from a third-party vendor.</li>
    <li> This cleanser works well, has no sodium laurel sulfate, and is totally fragrance free.  It is also very economical. Get one dispenser bottle (separately) and the gallon bottle for refills.</li>
    <li> I love this non-soap skin cleanser.  I&#x27;ve been using it as a face and body wash for over 20 years!  It is non-drying but cleans well.  If my sons have diaper rash, washing them with this will clear it up FAST.  It is a fabulous all-over cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part - Amazon&#x27;s price is better than getting it from the manufacturer!  At the time of my purchase, it was $32.95 on Amazon and $40.40 from the Nutribiotic website.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean the gel liner for my prosthetic. I gave some to my daughter to use on her sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff in the big bottle from Amazon because it is sometimes hard to find in brick and mortar stores, and I LOVE IT. Cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. It has a light, unobtrusive scent that doesn&#x27;t follow you around all day long. I would not wash my face with anything else.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use normal soap, not only can it have gluten, it&#x27;s usually full of all sorts of chemical junk.  This stuff works perfect with a mild pleasant scent that is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I use this carefully around my eyes (diluted of course) and for my face and other delicate areas.</li>
    <li> I have been using this non-soap for going on a couple of years now.  I developed miserable Dyshidrotic Eczema from a hand soap change at work and the recovery has been difficult.  I use this non-soap at home for washing my hands and as shower \\&quot;gel\\&quot; for bathing.  It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for ages, ever since I discovered it at Whole Foods.  I was thrilled when I found I could order this large bottle to refill my dispenser.  It&#x27;s the perfect cleanser, especially at the bathroom sink, for it&#x27;s mild cleansing without any strong scents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive skin and this stuff is great!</li>
    <li> I loved this as a face wash and soap and the great value until I realised it has sls...can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for a couple of good reasons - it is fragrance free and it is a cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out. I have been using this product for years. I use it for everything: in my hand soap dispensers and I bathe with it. A few years ago I know they stopped production for a while, because they removed the parabens that are generally used as a preservative in products. I use so much of it that it is definitely better to buy it in bulk and refill the smaller dispensers. I have also used the cleansers that have fragrances and they are very subtle in fragrance, but I prefer the fragrance free cleanser and I got tired of the fragrance cleansers. A great cleanser and I hope I never have to change or they stop production.</li>
    <li> Have used for years.  Excellent product.  Prompt delivery.  I would recommend the product and the vendor to anyone looking for an excellent all around soap.</li>
    <li> He always comments, &amp;#34;this smells good.&amp;#34;  But it&#x27;s not heavily scented at all, because I am sensitive to strong smells and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take it.  For those of you who think this is expensive, figure your cost per oz and compare it to lesser quality, mass-produced over the counter products. It may be pretty close in price, so go for this good stuff instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now… as to shipping. Congratulations on getting this to me in a timely way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of this post is not directed to this product or this seller, but to Amazon and UPS.  WHEN WILL YOU GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER???  I currently have FOUR packages delayed being shipped by UPS. Amazingly, some other packages being shipped by UPS have been delivered, most of them on time.  I&#x27;m a member of Amazon Prime and am supposed to get free delivery within 2 days. Hey, if it&#x27;s 3 days instead of 2, I never say a word. But 6, 8 or by the time things finally arrive, 10 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPS says it is due to &#x27;inclement weather&#x27; as to the reason for the delays. REALLY?  Here&#x27;s a news flash, UPS: It is winter. It gets cold. It often snows.  It does this each year. It is called a season.  So tell your drivers to put on hats and gloves and put chains on your tires and go do the job you are getting paid to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 4 packages being delayed, there is no expected delivery date. At the earliest, it will be 5 days LATE. No, not a total of 5 days, rather 5 days late.  Amazon, you really need to consider another source besides UPS.  Your drone idea made for a nice media splash, but with your money, why not start a competitor to UPS and FedEx?</li>
    <li> I use this for my whole body.  I keep it in all showers/tubs and at all sinks.  It does the job without drying.</li>
    <li> I love this low sudsing soap free cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great stuff -- great price -- thanks, Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product cleared 30 plantars warts from my feet, overnight. Fact....</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to chemical fragrances and have trouble finding shampoo/cleanser that my family can use as the bad stuff stinks up the house. I bought this as a &#x27;soap&#x27; + shampoo to use in a dispenser in my husband&#x27;s shower. It is awesome. Cleans well, has a slight aroma but doesn&#x27;t feel toxic. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought it some months back, use it always.&lt;br /&gt;Good: It is great for my skin. I compare it to SebaMed.&lt;br /&gt;Not so good: leaves skin less of natural body-oil, dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is sensitive, medium oily. i dislike soaps for reasons of irritation and a layer of soapy-chemicals, which cause allergic reactions, illness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still searching for something &#x27;natural&#x27; that cleans, won&#x27;t give dryness, won&#x27;t leave its residue (layer of chemicals) on skin.</li>
    <li> Keep this by the bathroom sink and in the shower to wash my face but prefer to use something else for my body. Great product and very gentle. Cleans my skin but doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleanser, especially for extremely sensitive skin. I have been using it for years and have never had a problem with it. When I am out of it my skin suffers. It has a light natural refreshing scent that is almost &amp;#34;not there&amp;#34;. Adding a high quality essential oil to it for shower gel works well too.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much as it is my 2nd gallon purchase.  Recommend it highly for anyone who needs an unscented skin cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love this soap for face, baby, and hand soap. Works well in both regular soap pumps and foaming pumps (diluted with water).</li>
