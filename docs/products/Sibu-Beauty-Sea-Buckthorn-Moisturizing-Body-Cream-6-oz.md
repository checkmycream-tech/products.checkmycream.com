<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I live this lotion! Been using for a year now and only on my hands because it&#x27;s pricey.. soo soft and silky.  Absorbs quickly and no oily residue. A++</li>
    <li> I absolutely looooooove this lotion! Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and I love that it&#x27;s also all natural. Super moisturizing but even better it absorbs super fast so I don&#x27;t feel slimy all day which is super important for me when considering a lotion!! Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love this body lotion...very quick delivery</li>
    <li> Wonderful med to heavy weight body cream. Lovely scent that dissipates quickly. Leaves skin baby soft and not sticky. Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> My Favorite Body Cream! I’ve used a zillion other body creams - all from Whole Foods Market. This is the one that stands out. Light, but very hydrating. Pleasant smell, rubs in nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My skin is very much better, not dry, just velvety. I was having trouble with other body lotions because they were so cloying and heavy my skin couldn&#x27;t breathe. However, this one absorbs quickly and is light and the scent is that of tangerines. I will buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> The orange smell is wonderful, doesn&#x27;t interfere with the perfume oils I use, and  my skin glows as touted by Sibu.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes your skin so soft and there is no greasy/ sticky feeling left behind.</li>
    <li> Anything by Sibu Beauty will go above and beyond your expectations.  This lotion is sublime.  It glides on and absorbs quickly.  It is not greasy but fully hydrates.  Not to mention that it is free of all the bad chemicals that are very bad for your body.</li>
    <li> LOVE.  I&#x27;m using it on my face, with it being so cold and dry outside I use it for my day cream and my night cream.  At night I mix a couple drops of rosehip oil in with it.  During the day it&#x27;s perfect for me.  Leaves my skin silky smooth (not oily!), and the scent is FABULOUS!  Very lightly scented - orange - delightful!  The scent does go away quickly after you apply it, and it is very light.  If you have trouble with very loud scents, you should be ok with this.  I am hooked - in love - you bet.  Price wise, not so much.  I&#x27;d love to try this on my body, I bet it&#x27;s wonderful - but I&#x27;m keeping it for my face only.  C&#x27;est la vie.  Am DEFINATELY planning to repurchase.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> Product met my expectations, and delivery fairly prompt.</li>
    <li> Has actually improved skin texture in a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Does not sit on top of skin but soaks in immediately; NO greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;Has a delightful light scent of oranges.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin. Most lotions make me itch to where I want to wash them off. This does not.&lt;br /&gt;Will repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;Good expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery by promised date.</li>
    <li> It works very good was fully satisfied. It made my skin look so healthy and smooth and the smell is pretty different but good.</li>
    <li> Smells great (like orange), feels great, and does its job as a moisturizer. I like it and will buy it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I thought this product would have been better.  It&#x27;s alot weaker than I expected.  It does hydrate skin but nothing special about it.</li>
    <li> I have gone though two of these now and will be buying more.  It smells good and penetrates fast.  Your skin feels so smooth and I like to think I am looking younger ;-)</li>
    <li> This stuff sinks in your skin and has some fantastic ingredients.  It leaves your skin moisturized, not sticky, and has lots of good quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> It is a very good lotion for hand and body. However, it is too pricey.  hope for a better price.</li>
    <li> I would recommend to anyone with skin issues. It is the best moisturizer ever. An MD recommended this cream to my brother for his exema</li>
    <li> Love the smell - especially because it&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; on me all day long. It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue and makes my skin feel fresh and smooth.</li>
    <li> I use this and the soap. Absolutely wonderful product, its thick and moisturizing without being greasy. I have been using sibu products for years and i recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I love this. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Leaves your skin really smooth</li>
    <li> I have tried so many hand and body lotions, always making sure the ingredients are truly \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. This one actually works. It seems to absorb right into the skin, which at first made me question that it was actually doing anything. But I know it is because I&#x27;m not having to apply it constantly, as I usually have to with other brands. My skin feels soft with one application until I wash my hands again. I will definitely be reordering this.</li>
    <li> I liked this lotion a lot, the light citrus scent was especially nice. I found it a little thin though, and didn&#x27;t find it to be spectacular as far as moisture went.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this, and eventually could no longer find it at my local health food store. It is a great body lotion.  I even take it with me for getting manicures and pedicures, and the nail techs always comment about how rich it is.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it as a body cream.  Use it as my AM moisturizer &amp; PM night cream.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely hydrates my face &amp; absorbs nicely.  Can apply makeup almost immediately to my face&lt;br /&gt;after application.  Just got tired of spending lots more money on moisturizers &amp; night creams.&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me this is what she now uses, thought I would give it a try.  I am quite pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the results.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful body cream.  All of their products are great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that has a powerful healing agent in it. I have Morgellons Disease and have been using the sea buckthorn soap for a couple of weeks with good success. At one point, I had a lot of lesions developing on my back-waist area which were very painful, so I used this cream. It burned a little, because these lesions, when open, react badly to water or water-based products, but after the initial burning stopped the area felt fine. Then I noticed that, within 2 days, the lesions were no longer red and were dried up and scabbed over. This is indicative of healing, so I was thrilled. Now I use this cream on all new outbreaks with great results.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Price was good and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> This stuff really brought out some color in my skin. It was a wonderful smell but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
    <li> The sea buckthorn is very far down on the ingredient list. If you are going to call a product by a specific name you should have that ingredient as the first or second ingredient listed.&lt;br /&gt;Just an expensive body lotion that doesn&#x27;t do anything special.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This body cream is thick and fragrant.  It does a good job of moisturizing my super dry skin.  I ordered it directly from Sibu originally.  The price on Amazon is good and the Prime delivery times and free shipping make this a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> Seabuckthorn oil will be better. Too many mixture in this. Prefer the plain oil</li>
    <li> Used this when I was pregnant to help with my dry itchy skin &amp; was pleased to find it didn&#x27;t have any overpowering scents. Nice, gentle every day lotion.</li>
    <li> great moisturizer, can&#x27;t live with out it</li>
    <li> Very nice chemical free body soap, free of harsh chemicals.  Recommended by EWG.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is great for aging skinn</li>
    <li> Wonderful for my eczema</li>
    <li> Keeps skin soft and blemish free on my body. Nice smell too. I already use Sibu seabuckthorn oil for my face and live that for my acne. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I use it on my face; I like the way it softens and brightens my skin without feeling greasy.  I usually mix a drop of the Sibu sea buckthorn oil with the dollop that I put on every day. I think this helps keep my skin clearer. I hope they keep making this forever, because I don&#x27;t want to try anything else since I discovered this.</li>
    <li> This body cream feels amazing when applied to the skin.  It is supposedly packed with nutrients and  has a nice scent too</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. I have searched for a long time for something that would not irritate my skin and at the same time keep it soft. This does both. I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I love this body cream and Sibu! I use several Sibu products and have been pleased with all of them. The body cream has a light fragrance of citrus and an intense moisturizing effect. The sea buckthorn makes my skin glow with a dewy, but not wet or greasy finish. It also made my hives and scars disappear over time. I have bought several times and plan to make this my only body cream in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has a great citrus scent, feels nice on my skin, and is non-greasy. Another great Sibu product.</li>
