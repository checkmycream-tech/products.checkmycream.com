      <li>but it still works fine.</li>
      <li>I love it, it came very fast!</li>
      <li>I buy mine on ebay with free shipping for about $6.  </li>
      <li>Originally got this in the kit.  </li>
      <li>The picture is for a full size mascara.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to get the mascara without being a member of Sheer Cover&#x27;s program.  </li>
      <li>Please be aware that this one is the 0.13 fl oz, and not the 0.30 fl oz.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for sensitive eyes and it is easy to remove besides being water resistant.  </li>

      <li>I think the products I received were old.</li>
      <li>It seems pretty dry.</li>
      <li>It definitely isn&#x27;t the false eyelash look but it greatly enhances and they do look long again.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nothing compared to the sheer cover mascara I normally buy.</li>
      <li>I think it should disclose that it is smaller than the normal size.</li>
      <li>I have really short lashes, so this really gives them extra length.  </li>

    <li> Recieved quickly, no hassles.  Product seems a bit dry so it may be old but it still works fine.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price.  Don&#x27;t need much to remove it and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Originally got this in the kit.  The wand allows you to get very close to the roots without clumping.  It doesn&#x27;t flake yet it washes off so easily.   It definitely isn&#x27;t the false eyelash look but it greatly enhances and they do look long again. (I always use 2 coats of any mascara)My lashes no longer fall out as they did with the one that was supposed to enhance growth.  For an \\&quot;older\\&quot; person, this is the best.</li>
    <li> The size of the mascara was smaller than it looked on the picture and it&#x27;s nothing compared to the sheer cover mascara I normally buy. It seems pretty dry.</li>
    <li> I love it, it came very fast! I already tried this mascara before and i love it.</li>
    <li> I do not like this mascara at all! It is rubbery, makes my eyelashes sticky, and doesn&#x27;t stay on. It leaves splotches on above eyes and under, that are difficult ti remove, worst mascara I ever tried</li>
    <li> Really like this product…My eyes are very sensitive and I can&#x27;t use many mascara&#x27;s.  This mascara gives me no problems.</li>
    <li> Sheer cover makeup works great for me, wish it was less costly but everything was as expected with this product.</li>
    <li> The picture is for a full size mascara. The product was a mini, about half of what was pictured.  I think it should disclose that it is smaller than the normal size.</li>
    <li> When I took the brush out of the tube, the brush was not attached to the wand.  I think the products I received were old.</li>
    <li> This mascara is one of the BEST that I have used.  I have really short lashes, so this really gives them extra length.  I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> My favorite- long lasting but also easy to remove with face wipes.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite mascara.  lengthens lashes without all the clumps.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered, and arrive in short time. Will purchase again. Thank You.</li>
    <li> this product was all dried out, and the brush actually stuck inside the tube because it was old and dried out.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERY brand and nothing compares to this mascara.  I highly recommend it for sensitive eyes and it is easy to remove besides being water resistant.  It isn&#x27;t waterproof, but water resistant.</li>
    <li> I bought the sheer cover starter kit about two years ago.  Of all the products in it, it is the mascara I fell in love with.  My eyelashes are short and straight.  Not much to look at, but this mascara gives them length and I love it!!  I have tried other mascaras, but this is definitely the one for me.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge and run.  Perfect for my oily skin.  If you have short eyelashes I recommend you give this one a try.  I buy mine on ebay with free shipping for about $6.  If this is not the one for you then you haven&#x27;t lost much, however, chances are you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
    <li> Please be aware that this one is the 0.13 fl oz, and not the 0.30 fl oz. I bought this one thinking it was the 0.30 fl oz one, but when i received it, it was the 0.13 fl oz. The 0.30 fl oz one cost me $10 when I bought it a while ago, and this one cost me approximately $10 with shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this 0.13 fl oz one is really not worth the price.</li>
    <li> It seemed out dated or dried to me.  I have to work with it to get the mascara on brush to actually see it on my lashes.  I would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> Disappointed it was more like a sample size and the mascara was very sticky!  I use sheer over and thought I would get it here...never again.</li>
    <li> Fast exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I was pleased to get the mascara without being a member of Sheer Cover&#x27;s program.  I received it in a timely manner and am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that I will be buying another one of this item. It clumps and not worth the money.</li>
