      <li>That blade is great for edging/ precision trimming.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>Great quality.  </li>

      <li>I realize this product was meant for humans, but I discovered a great alternative use.  </li>
      <li>This has turned out to be very handy.  </li>
      <li>Does a good trim job on my mustache.</li>
      <li>quick shipping item working perfect</li>
      <li>Good weight, perfect size, strong motor, appropriate accessories.</li>
      <li>Nice design and love the portability of it, but bothers me greatly that is used batteries like water, and did not cut the way it promised.</li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;d say that you can probably find better ones to use as your primary every day/every week trimmer, but this unit&#x27;s size make it perfect to throw in your travel bag.</li>
      <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t provide a nice edge, nor would it cut.  </li>
      <li>Nice close cut.  </li>
      <li>The included bag is a nice addition.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is perfect for travel, but not so good for regular use.</li>
      <li>A full complement of trim combs let you select the length you want to maintain, and the cordless, AA-battery power makes it very handy to use.</li>
      <li>The trimmer comes with six detachable length guards which he has not used but they snap on and off very easily.</li>
      <li>love the Andis t-guard blade on the T-Outliner.</li>
      <li>The item has many attachments (14 in all) for hair-trimming, and as well as a cordless beard/mustache trimmer, storage/travel pouch and 6 attachment combs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, this trimmer is battery operated and I am okay with that.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this trimmer for mustaches but if I had a beard I would want something more</li>
      <li>Keeping it trimmed is a top priority for me as an overgrown, wild-looking \\&quot;stache\\</li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>Wahl has better models, that&#x27;s all I am going to say...</li>
      <li>I love to use the Andis 24870 Andis Trim &#x27;N Go Palm Trimmer.</li>
      <li>Because of this I have owned many mustache and beard trimmers in my lifetime so when I got a chance to try this one out</li>
      <li>I was able to use a corner to trim nose hair</li>
      <li>Cool, handy trimmer.  </li>
      <li>This is an incredible little hair trimmer, we&#x27;re very glad to have received.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to transport.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to store and use</li>
      <li>They are not that loud and fit great in your hand.</li>
      <li>The extended clipper head makes it easy to trim around ears and your lip.</li>
      <li>I am not noted for giving way easily to enthusiasm, but am enchanted by the Andis 24870 trimmer.</li>
      <li>I have sported a full mustache from about the time that I was able to grow one, about 40 years now.  </li>
      <li>Hands down, the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>that seems fine.</li>
      <li>I bought this to use on the ears of my little dog as I had a set before that was awesome..</li>
      <li>The whole cordless aspect is particularly handy.  </li>
      <li>No need to spend 40 bucks on a beard trimmer, this works great and has numerous attachments..</li>
      <li>works really well and is just a really handy and convenient thing to have around.  </li>
      <li>I experienced that one yesterday, multiple times...</li>
      <li>They work pretty good just may have to go over a couple more times than normal.</li>
      <li>And these are far superior to the others.</li>
      <li>For that reason I took really good care of it, cleaned it after each use, oiled frequently, kept the protective cap on when not in</li>
      <li>and it is quieter than a full size one so they dont get scared as well as less vibration which is perfect for their tender feet!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having said that, this item is well made, it&#x27;s quiet and seems to cut very nicely.</li>
      <li>While not up to the task of a full-scale haircut, the Andis 24870 is a handy little trimmer for keeping a buzzcut or a light beard looking good.</li>
      <li>understand that there are power limitations because it operates on AA batteries, but the Wahl half-pint is also battery-operated only and does a great, painless, and quick job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>item even includes barber and mustache tools, plus items to help clean your trimming blade(a brush and oil) plus a blade guard, and (believe it or not) trimming instructions on how to operate the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>trimmer runs on a single AA battery, which is great.</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to decide to buy or not because most of the reviewers got it for free!!</li>
      <li>Not a bad trimmer it performs as advertise.</li>
      <li>I generally prefer trimmers with a more powerful and rechargeable battery, and also larger units that fit more comfortably in your hand and get the job done better.</li>
      <li>First try with the stache trimmer almost made it disappear!</li>
      <li>The build quality seems decent and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It comes with several guards, which was a nice surprise.</li>
      <li>We have a golden retriever and was going to use these for his feet.</li>
      <li>Andis trimmer has an unique shape and feels good in the hand, albeit I find it to be a little stubby.  </li>
      <li>and he is very calm during the whole process.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect for sculpting facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought these because I am deployed overseas right now.</li>
      <li>Also it is perfect for travel as it is small compared to many other trimmers.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty quiet and because it&#x27;s cordless, it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It does eat quickly through the batteries, and it doesn’t have as much power as I would like to see.</li>
      <li>I was very much looking forward to this trimmer.</li>
      <li>SOMETHING VERY MUCH WANTED.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s also a nice little travel bag, a couple of combs, and a brush and some oil to clean and lubricate the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When it arrived, this  thing felt like a surprisingly precision little instrument.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny.</li>
      <li>I think the Size, Styling, and Components of this trimmer are pretty on point.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;This works best on small jobs, as a personal trimmer.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t what I expected still handy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small, handy, light and it almost trims hair.</li>
      <li>Works fast!  </li>
      <li>This is a good little trimmer, although a ‘palm trimmer’ sounds like a gift for a werewolf!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this clipper, it fits right in my son&#x27;s hygiene bag when he needs to stay over night somewhere.</li>
      <li>AA batteries are easy to find if you&#x27;re traveling (especially abroad where power converters could be a problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Look, you can do a lot better for just a few more bucks, so save yourself the headache and spend the extra cash.</li>
      <li>I really like this trimmer</li>
      <li>I was very</li>
      <li>It comes with more accessories than any other trimmer that I have owned.  </li>
      <li>Was a little worried buying clipper with disposable batteries, but the battery seems to last for a good while.</li>
      <li>I can highly recommend their products.</li>
      <li>I say that because - while the wide blade is good on your beard and wide areas - it&#x27;s less easy to use on my mustache.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s small, handy, light and it almost trims hair. Fairly weak.</li>
    <li> The cippers were listed on the amazon site like they were regular dual voltage t-edger clippers. When I finally received the clippers after experiencing multiple issues with the delivery, the clippers were not as listed on the site. The clippers are battery operated and don&#x27;t cut close as described on the amazon site. I am disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> Great liners.  however you will need to adjust the blades for a sharper cut.  not much of a big deal since you will have to do that with just about every pair of liners you purchase.  i like how small it is, and easily transportable.  comes with a nice thick black carry bag.  i figure this can be used on a flight, before you go to work and forget to shave you can just do it in the car.  this is just an awesome product.  i will like to purchase another one.  I have prime so i paid only 11 dollars and some change.  under 12 bucks.  this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> For the size and the price, I am quite impressed. However, I will probably have to adjust the screws for an even closer shave. They are not that loud and fit great in your hand.</li>
    <li> Nice close cut.  Great quality.  Was a little worried buying clipper with disposable batteries, but the battery seems to last for a good while.</li>
    <li> This is a very good trimmer. I do not have a beard (thank goodness!) but it is great for cleaning up my husbands sideburns and neck. Also it is perfect for travel as it is small compared to many other trimmers. It fits perfectly in his travel hygiene bag and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. The trimmer comes with six detachable length guards which he has not used but they snap on and off very easily. I gave this trimmer four stars only because it is not rechargeable. Batteries are included and supply plenty of power.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I am deployed overseas right now. My regular T outliners don&#x27;t do too well with the power difference out here, and I bump up if I use a straight razor, so I found these as a replacement. They have the same blade as my T outliners back home. They work pretty good just may have to go over a couple more times than normal. I just adjusted the blade with a screwdriver and they work like normal. They take a little to get used to because these are really small, so my hands swallow them. No big deal though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice compact trimmer that&#x27;s perfect for travel. It runs on 1 standard AA battery, which is 1) convenient but 2) also means that you might end up feeling like the battery&#x27;s drained and you need to replace it. I generally prefer trimmers with a more powerful and rechargeable battery, and also larger units that fit more comfortably in your hand and get the job done better. So, I&#x27;d say that you can probably find better ones to use as your primary every day/every week trimmer, but this unit&#x27;s size make it perfect to throw in your travel bag.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible little hair trimmer, we&#x27;re very glad to have received. The item has many attachments (14 in all) for hair-trimming, and as well as a cordless beard/mustache trimmer, storage/travel pouch and 6 attachment combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item even includes barber and mustache tools, plus items to help clean your trimming blade(a brush and oil) plus a blade guard, and (believe it or not) trimming instructions on how to operate the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
    <li> I am not noted for giving way easily to enthusiasm, but am enchanted by the Andis 24870 trimmer. The only thing I could criticize is calling it a \\&quot;palm trimmer\\&quot;: who has hair on their palms? Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect for sculpting facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper (\\&quot;trimmer\\&quot;) is smaller than my palm. It runs on one AA battery (one was included in the package) and is about twice as big as an AA battery. It comes in a small pouch with half a dozen attachments to snap on over the blades (I gravitate to the 3/8\\&quot; one for my beard, 1/2\\&quot; for my eyebrows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a tiny brush to remove hair left on the clipper, a vial of machine oil to lubricate the blades, and two tapered combs. Plus a blade guard. And a warning not to try to use underwater...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a complete haircut, the small trimmer might be tedious. I was able to use a corner to trim nose hair</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer, it&#x27;s quiet and being cordless, very convenient to use.  You get a bunch of attachments, including about 6 different snap-on attachments to control how long the hair is before it gets cut.  There&#x27;s also a nice little travel bag, a couple of combs, and a brush and some oil to clean and lubricate the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works really well and is just a really handy and convenient thing to have around.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> While not up to the task of a full-scale haircut, the Andis 24870 is a handy little trimmer for keeping a buzzcut or a light beard looking good. A full complement of trim combs let you select the length you want to maintain, and the cordless, AA-battery power makes it very handy to use.</li>
    <li> the best trimmer ever.  I use it on my mini dog face, around eyes and lips</li>
    <li> I have sported a full mustache from about the time that I was able to grow one, about 40 years now.  I have shaved it off a few times but friends and family encouraged me to regrow it.  Keeping it trimmed is a top priority for me as an overgrown, wild-looking \\&quot;stache\\&quot; is not suitable for many business situations. Because of this I have owned many mustache and beard trimmers in my lifetime so when I got a chance to try this one out I was very interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andis trimmer has an unique shape and feels good in the hand, albeit I find it to be a little stubby.  It comes with more accessories than any other trimmer that I have owned.  My only complaint is that it feels under-powered and sometimes snags a mustache hair, which is fairly painful.  I would recommend this trimmer for mustaches but if I had a beard I would want something more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This is a good little trimmer, although a ‘palm trimmer’ sounds like a gift for a werewolf! It does eat quickly through the batteries, and it doesn’t have as much power as I would like to see. (They were new Duracell batteries) but it comes with all you need, different size combs, oil and a brush, all together in a nice little zip up container.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for travel, but not so good for regular use.</li>
    <li> Does a good trim job on my mustache. I like the compact size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s funny. I like this trimmer in some ways. The small size is easy to pack but I&#x27;ve been using a longer one and this is difficult to adjust to. It&#x27;s almost too small in your hand and therefore hard to manipulate. It&#x27;s made a little more difficult because the cutting blade itself is a little too big. Weird huh? I say that because - while the wide blade is good on your beard and wide areas - it&#x27;s less easy to use on my mustache. Sometimes that requires a more narrow blade to get into the corner and the contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this item is well made, it&#x27;s quiet and seems to cut very nicely. Hence the four-star rating. Ultimately you&#x27;ll like it if you trim most wide areas, less so if you just have a a stache to trim up. But don&#x27;t be scared of the quality - that seems fine.</li>
    <li> It basically gets the job done, although it leaves a little bit too long hair for me. Not sure that I would buy it again, but again I am not so unhappy with it that I would return it. Wahl has better models, that&#x27;s all I am going to say...</li>
    <li> Great purchase for my Fiance for his trips</li>
    <li> I love to use the Andis 24870 Andis Trim &#x27;N Go Palm Trimmer. It is small enough to fit in my hand when I am trimming my son&#x27;s side burns and hair line. He uses it to use on his mustache and beard. It comes with 14 attachments and a little hair brush with oil to clean the clippers after each use. It&#x27;s pretty quiet and because it&#x27;s cordless, it&#x27;s very easy to use. It works on one AA battery, and is pretty powerful for a little trimmer. I would highly recommend this clipper, it fits right in my son&#x27;s hygiene bag when he needs to stay over night somewhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 rechargeable cordless Andis beard trimmers now and the batteries always seem to fail around 1 yr, thought I&#x27;d give this a shot since I can use rechargeable AAs instead. It works very well in that respect, however, the cutting head doesn&#x27;t seem to cut the hair as close to the skin as the bigger non-AA models. If that doesn&#x27;t bother you this thing is worth having for daily or travel use. I think I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected still handy</li>
    <li> Love this and it&#x27;s easy to store and use</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Andis clippers. I have had a couple over the past few years and they seem to be much, much better than any of the other clippers you can buy. I can highly recommend their products. This one 24870 is a neat little product. And when I say little, it&#x27;s really quite small. I posted a picture comparing the two sizes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Andis t-guard blade on the T-Outliner. This has the same T-shaped blade. That blade is great for edging/ precision trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer runs on a single AA battery, which is great. AA batteries are easy to find if you&#x27;re traveling (especially abroad where power converters could be a problem).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only major complaint is that it might need two AA batteries to really rock. I realize that it&#x27;s pretty small, and they are kind of confined to the smaller space. When trying to go through my bear, it seemed a little under-powered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works best on small jobs, as a personal trimmer. I would not use it to shave my head for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to transport. It comes with several guards, which was a nice surprise.</li>
    <li> This trimmer sucks.&lt;br /&gt;I catches my beard hairs and pulls them out because the motor is too weak to cut my beard hair fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that there are power limitations because it operates on AA batteries, but the Wahl half-pint is also battery-operated only and does a great, painless, and quick job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: DO NOT BUY. BUY WAHL HALF PINT INSTEAD.</li>
    <li> This has turned out to be very handy.  I have been looking for something that let&#x27;s us keep my and the kid&#x27;s hair a little neater between haircuts.  This does the trick superbly.  The whole cordless aspect is particularly handy.  It is reasonably quiet and it comes with a bag to stuff everything into.  I run on a AA battery which is included  It has plenty of trimming attachments.  Just by spacing out family haircuts a bit it should pay for itself in no time.  The build quality seems decent and it&#x27;s easy to use.  For the price it&#x27;s hard to go wrong.</li>
    <li> Palm trimmer, to get that stubborn hair off your palms.</li>
    <li> Great for removing hair from the paws and face. Small enough to get into all the nooks and crannies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other small, battery-powered clippers before. And these are far superior to the others. The extended clipper head makes it easy to trim around ears and your lip. It also has quite a bit of power too. The included bag is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> I was very much looking forward to this trimmer. I think the Size, Styling, and Components of this trimmer are pretty on point.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like however, the over all performance of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this trimmer is battery operated and I am okay with that. I&#x27;ve had some battery operated trimmers in the past and no problems there. The problem I had with this one is that It kept draining batteries, new batteries mind you.  I bought a pack of new energizer batteries as a supply to this trimmer, and with in 5 to 10 minutes of use it kept killing them. STRIKE ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the little engine powers the blade is very quite. You may say &amp;#34;That&#x27;s Great!&amp;#34;, but in reality the reason why is so quiet is because this little guy produces very little power. Result? Very uneven and non precise cut.  I had to go over spots multiple times ensure an even area. Unacceptable! STRIKE TWO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know that feeling, the one you get when a trimmer suddenly loses power and dies, resulting in your facial hair being pulled? I experienced that one yesterday, multiple times... I tried doing edging as well as removing fuss behind my neck but it wouldn&#x27;t provide a nice edge, nor would it cut.  STRIKE THREE, YOU ARE OUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be the worst trimmer I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve had some bad ones in the past.</li>
    <li> quick shipping item working perfect</li>
    <li> Works great.  Great price and I plan to get an extra one !</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on the ears of my little dog as I had a set before that was awesome..These will not cut anything at all..</li>
    <li> When it arrived, this  thing felt like a surprisingly precision little instrument.  Good weight, perfect size, strong motor, appropriate accessories. For that reason I took really good care of it, cleaned it after each use, oiled frequently, kept the protective cap on when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;It worked great at first, but now after using it maybe 8-10 times it catches and pulls my beard painfully.  Really disappointing.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect size for doing dog faces and feet!  and it is quieter than a full size one so they dont get scared as well as less vibration which is perfect for their tender feet!</li>
    <li> I realize this product was meant for humans, but I discovered a great alternative use.  I use it to groom the face of my Chinese crested power-puff and he is very calm during the whole process.  It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise.  And, since it uses a battery - you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging in advance or worry that the internal battery is going to die at some point in the future.  It grooms close and does not nick.</li>
    <li> Not a bad trimmer it performs as advertise.</li>
    <li> I have to say they lasted one time and that was it. We have a golden retriever and was going to use these for his feet. Low quality and could not cut all four paws. I would not recommend And is trim N go palm trimmer and I was not able to cut all four paws on our dog. The charge was full and the power was weak. Blade for trimming seemed to dull on the hair. We ended up buying bread trimmers at the mart.</li>
    <li> Disappointing. Nice design and love the portability of it, but bothers me greatly that is used batteries like water, and did not cut the way it promised. Look, you can do a lot better for just a few more bucks, so save yourself the headache and spend the extra cash.</li>
    <li> No need to spend 40 bucks on a beard trimmer, this works great and has numerous attachments..</li>
    <li> GREAT TEM SOMETHING VERY MUCH WANTED.</li>
    <li> Cool, handy trimmer.  Works fast!  First try with the stache trimmer almost made it disappear! LOL...  Like the fact that it uses a regular battery.  Last one lasted for years until the rechargeable part quit.</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to decide to buy or not because most of the reviewers got it for free!!</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
