### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>One of the best mascara brands I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Excellent service provider.</li>
      <li>good price for this!</li>
      <li>good product to cover the lower lashes of my eyes!</li>
      <li>All in all a great product offering thickness and some length</li>
      <li>The minis are great as I do not keep the mascara in use for too lomg.</li>
      <li>good delivery by the seller.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, goes on great and looks good.  </li>
      <li>:) Thank you!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This mascara went on very smooth not clumpy and added a touch of length  .I</li>
      <li>ideal for my daily makeup bag size.</li>
      <li>and when I decide to buy the full size I know I will be paying alot more</li>
      <li>No clumps, goes on smooth and lasts.</li>
      <li>Quick use in about two weeks.</li>
      <li>really like how this was so easy to put on and how it looked .If</li>
      <li>Does not seem to be filled with much mascara.</li>
      <li>so I personally  think these travel sizes are perfect especially since I like my mascara fresh where the full sizes tend to dry out on me faster</li>
      <li>I also think the price is very reasonable  for a name brand product.</li>
      <li>I have a few that I have always received  good products from.</li>
      <li>and I end up tossing it before I use the whole tube.</li>
      <li>honestly  I have never had one that arrived dried out that was unusable</li>
      <li>Goes on very smooth without clumping and helps lengthen slightly</li>
      <li>but for me I find these convenient for traveling or trying out different brands before I buy the regular size to make sure I like it .</li>
      <li>but I wish it created a little more volume.</li>
      <li>I bought this because mascara often burns my eyes and some people recommended this for sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>I get the same size in free gifts, so it was not worth the price</li>
      <li>The brush is dry in the middle as if there isn&#x27;t much product within.</li>
      <li>This small size lasts an  amazingly long time, goes on smoothly,  and does not clump after its been</li>

<li> Makes your lashes twice as long!</li>
<li> Since this is a sample size, I must wonder if it has been previously USED.</li>
<li> I read alot of reviews how this is sample ,dried  up etc</li>
<li> Not only did this burn too, but it smudged under my eyes worse than any mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> The brush was completely dried up.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s definitely not my favorite.</li>
<li> In the past I have always purchased the less expensive mascaras but after&lt;br /&gt;receiving a sample of Clinique mascara</li>
<li> not a good one.</li>
<li> Disappointed, as it&#x27;s not worth paying to return.</li>

    <li> I have sensitive eyes so i only use tthe clinique brand. The minis are great as I do not keep the mascara in use for too lomg. All in all a great product offering thickness and some length</li>
    <li> Excellent service provider. I recommend buy</li>
    <li> This item was not sealed and was listed as &amp;#34;not for individual sale&amp;#34;. The brush was completely dried up.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara a lot but it&#x27;s definitely not my favorite. Goes on very smooth without clumping and helps lengthen slightly but I wish it created a little more volume.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, goes on great and looks good.  I actually prefer the small container because I can&#x27;t use it for months and months anyway because of my sensitive eyes.  So smaller is not wasteful.</li>
    <li> it was smaller than I expected. I get the same size in free gifts, so it was not worth the price</li>
    <li> Does not seem to be filled with much mascara. Quick use in about two weeks.</li>
    <li> good product to cover the lower lashes of my eyes! ideal for my daily makeup bag size. good delivery by the seller. RECOMMEND FOR YOUR LOWER LASH BRUSH ON POINT.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> This item was not sealed! The brush is dry in the middle as if there isn&#x27;t much product within. Since this is a sample size, I must wonder if it has been previously USED. I can&#x27;t use it for fear of bacterial infection, plus only the tip gets coated when removing the brush, so it&#x27;s either old and dried out or used. Disappointed, as it&#x27;s not worth paying to return.</li>
    <li> Makes your lashes twice as long!</li>
    <li> good price for this! will keep my  eye on it~~~</li>
    <li> Something new..works gud.</li>
    <li> I bought this because mascara often burns my eyes and some people recommended this for sensitive eyes. Not only did this burn too, but it smudged under my eyes worse than any mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> In the past I have always purchased the less expensive mascaras but after&lt;br /&gt;receiving a sample of Clinique mascara I am a believer that you need to look for&lt;br /&gt;quality.  This small size lasts an  amazingly long time, goes on smoothly,  and does not clump after its been&lt;br /&gt;open a while. Its so inexpensive also. I paid as much if not more for lesser quality brands that I threw out&lt;br /&gt;before I used them up.</li>
    <li> I love it! No clumps, goes on smooth and lasts. One of the best mascara brands I&#x27;ve ever used. :) Thank you!</li>
    <li> not a good one. clumpy</li>
    <li> I read alot of reviews how this is sample ,dried  up etc .Anyway I have been ordering travel size mascaras different brands and the travel are the samples always have been and I have never have one arrived that was sealed but was always wrapped with tissue paper or bubble wrap depending on why you choose to order this size idk but for me I find these convenient for traveling or trying out different brands before I buy the regular size to make sure I like it . honestly  I have never had one that arrived dried out that was unusable but I&#x27;m by no means doubting anyone one reason is we can choose the seller we want to.purchase from.I have a few that I have always received  good products from.This mascara went on very smooth not clumpy and added a touch of length  .I really like how this was so easy to put on and how it looked .If and when I decide to buy the full size I know I will be paying alot more so I personally  think these travel sizes are perfect especially since I like my mascara fresh where the full sizes tend to dry out on me faster and I end up tossing it before I use the whole tube.I also think the price is very reasonable  for a name brand product.</li>
