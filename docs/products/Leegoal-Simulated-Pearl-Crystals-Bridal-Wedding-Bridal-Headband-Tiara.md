      <li>It is as cute as it appears; however, I have not a clue how to pin it because there is no comb or pins included.</li>
      <li>I love the way it looks, bends easily against head.</li>
      <li>Very fragile but beautiful item.</li>
      <li>very fast shipping, beautiful piece but came with one little &#x27;&#x27;crystal&#x27;&#x27; off, good that we found it in the bag</li>
      <li>Very pretty and easy to bend into desired shape</li>
      <li>Quality is definitely better than expected and she looked amazing without coming close to going over her budget.</li>
      <li>But It is beautiful little thing</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s  very pretty,  </li>
      <li>Very pretty, It should work for my wedding.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, but a piece broke off the minute I tried to bend it.</li>
      <li>Nice piece, bendable and usable in many situations but the thing is HEAVY.</li>
      <li>It looks exactly as on the picture.</li>
      <li>It was pretty, and it served its purpose.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty.</li>
      <li>It came as a straight price of metal, basically.</li>
      <li>It arrived on time, and very well protected in the box, so the chance for being damaged while in transport is almost zero.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>It comes straight and you have to bend it to the tiara shape.</li>
      <li>it was packaged very neatly</li>
      <li>We loved the versatility of the piece she can wear it in several different ways without it being the &amp;#34;same old thing&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I will glue it on with the hopes it will stay for the wedding, but was just sad because it was so beautiful.</li>
      <li>To heavy, you wont be able to make it a halo  </li>
      <li>I used it like a normal headband, when I wore it for prom.</li>
      <li>It would easily attach with bobby pins and fits in a number of styles on your head, but the thing is so heavy if you have slick or fine hair forget about it.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even have the chance to get it shaped, barely started to curve it when a piece snapped off.</li>
      <li>Only negative, its not quite as flexable as I thought it would be, but hopefully it will bend to fit my head if needed.</li>

<li> it was super fraguil, it not good</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable but looks amazing</li>
<li> Little more complicated to attach</li>
<li> Just make sure you put it far enough above your ear, it got a little annoying.</li>
<li> However, it was kind of uncomfortable, and heavy, and hard to bend.</li>
<li> DO NOT ORDER , TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY</li>
<li> The shipping was as expected, and it was all in tact.</li>
<li> There are no specific attachment points as others have noted but it&#x27;s not that hard to add a bobby pin through the wire and support it where you need it.</li>
<li> This is waaaay too heavy &amp; will not even stay on my head no matter how U try to pin it in UR hair .</li>
<li> We just used some heavy duty bobby pins to keep it in, and it stayed all day till the end.</li>
<li> Not sure what the lifetime will be though.</li>
<li> But it wasn&#x27;t too hard to bend.</li>
<li> I used this on my wedding day but had a hard time trying to get it to stay.</li>
<li> it is hard to use it.</li>
<li> It is not a chain , it is hard iron or something like that</li>

    <li> one of the pearls and one of the diamelles fell off within 5 minutes of unwrapping the bubble wrap.</li>
    <li> Really nice. It looks exactly as on the picture. Little more complicated to attach but it&#x27;s nothing crazy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item. It arrived on time, and very well protected in the box, so the chance for being damaged while in transport is almost zero.</li>
    <li> I loved it... I wore for my wedding it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable but looks amazing</li>
    <li> It was pretty, and it served its purpose. However, it was kind of uncomfortable, and heavy, and hard to bend. I used it like a normal headband, when I wore it for prom. I&#x27;m probably never going to wear it again</li>
    <li> This is waaaay too heavy &amp; will not even stay on my head no matter how U try to pin it in UR hair . DO NOT ORDER , TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> it was super fraguil, it not good</li>
    <li> Junk. Don&#x27;t even get the band.</li>
    <li> To heavy, you wont be able to make it a halo  like I  was going to.. I  can not use it. But It is beautiful little thing</li>
    <li> This is a pretty. And at a great price.</li>
    <li> Nice piece, bendable and usable in many situations but the thing is HEAVY. It would easily attach with bobby pins and fits in a number of styles on your head, but the thing is so heavy if you have slick or fine hair forget about it. There are no specific attachment points as others have noted but it&#x27;s not that hard to add a bobby pin through the wire and support it where you need it.</li>
    <li> It doesnt look like the pic.&lt;br /&gt;And it is hard to use it. It is not a chain , it is hard iron or something like that</li>
    <li> Very pretty and easy to bend into desired shape but it does not have any hooks or combs or anything to attach it to your head. I used this on my wedding day but had a hard time trying to get it to stay. Once it was pinned it stayed the entire day. would definitely recommend this product, but would warn about the lack of something to hold it in place. So they would have time to figure out how they can do that. The shipping was as expected, and it was all in tact.</li>
    <li> very fast shipping, beautiful piece but came with one little &#x27;&#x27;crystal&#x27;&#x27; off, good that we found it in the bag so we had to glue it back. i hope that everything will stay in the same place for the wedding...</li>
    <li> This looked really cute at my wedding. It worked well. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was, it is not on a flexible string. It came as a straight price of metal, basically. So we had to bend it to shape it to my head. But it wasn&#x27;t too hard to bend. We just used some heavy duty bobby pins to keep it in, and it stayed all day till the end. Just make sure you put it far enough above your ear, it got a little annoying.</li>
    <li> I love !!! is so very beautiful!</li>
    <li> Looks just like the picture. I really like it I haven&#x27;t tried it on yet. But it&#x27;s  very pretty,  I am glade it was packaged very neatly I love it. Received it in two weeks.</li>
    <li> I love the way it looks, bends easily against head. Doesn&#x27;t come with anything to keep it in place, need some sort of thing to situate the ends. Otherwise very lovely!!</li>
    <li> Very fragile but beautiful item. Not sure what the lifetime will be though. The pearls are not white they are ivory and you will require hair pins or strap to hold headband in place on your head.</li>
    <li> I knew purchasing this that it had to clamps.  But when I used it for my daughter with bobby pins it would slide out. So I ended up attaching ribbon to both ends. That did the trip and it looked beautiful on my daughter at the wedding. Also it was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, It should work for my wedding. There are no Pins to hold it in place so make sure you account for that, either string or bobby pins.  Only negative, its not quite as flexable as I thought it would be, but hopefully it will bend to fit my head if needed.</li>
    <li> My Daughter wore it to her Jr prom. We loved the versatility of the piece she can wear it in several different ways without it being the &amp;#34;same old thing&amp;#34;. Quality is definitely better than expected and she looked amazing without coming close to going over her budget.</li>
    <li> It is as cute as it appears; however, I have not a clue how to pin it because there is no comb or pins included.</li>
    <li> Very nice item for the price but I did not anticipate that it would not have combs or pins to attach the ends.  You must supply your own.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful. On time delivery</li>
    <li> very nice n sturdy .... 5 stars</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but a piece broke off the minute I tried to bend it. It comes straight and you have to bend it to the tiara shape. Didn&#x27;t even have the chance to get it shaped, barely started to curve it when a piece snapped off. I will glue it on with the hopes it will stay for the wedding, but was just sad because it was so beautiful.</li>
