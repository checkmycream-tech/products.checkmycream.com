      <li>Nice little clip that keeps hair in place securely and the color blends are quite attractive from any angle.</li>
      <li>When I received this, way overpacked (is someone going to tell Amazon that the waste on their packing is incredible!)</li>
      <li>I choose this clips because of the unique marbling effect and I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>A great hair clip, Just like all of the Karina brand clips, it has the right amount of hold and it looks nice, not cheap like the ones at the drug store.</li>

      <li>have fine shoulder length hair and it works really well and stays in place.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It has a strong spring, which most clips don&#x27;t, but falls short of being perfect because it is just a little to small.</li>
      <li>I might add, I thought, large box, large hair claw!  </li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift, and she really likes it.  </li>
      <li>very well (i.e., doesn&#x27;t start to &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; within minutes).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s looks and feels different from cheap clips you get at discount stores.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Sturdy and can holds all of my hair very well.</li>
      <li>It has a good grip for medium length hair, but might not hold long or thick hair securely.</li>
      <li>I have long and thick hair and it secures my hair very good.</li>
      <li>the 1990&#x27;s and the quality is consistent , so far.  </li>
      <li>bought the gorgeous vintage, the france luxe and monet claw clip for my daughter who has very thick hair.  </li>
      <li>A few strands came loose but overall it worked beautifully.  </li>
      <li>It has smooth edged claws which prevents digging into my scalp unlike other products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised and so bought another!</li>
      <li>Very lovely, well-made clip that hopefully will last a while (at least until I lose it).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Smaller than I expected, but well-made, strong clip.</li>
      <li>It holds the hair very well, hopefully the quality will last.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Pretty and holds hair in place well!</li>
    <li> This clip is beautiful and well-made. I loved it so much I bought another in case this one wears out. Have been using it daily for at least six months. No sign of wear.</li>
    <li> A beautiful clip! Firm grip. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> High quality and beautiful color clip!! Made in France!  YES!</li>
    <li> What a beautiful claw clip with nice spring and feel to it. You will have to have plenty of hair to use this.</li>
    <li> It looks good and has held up well. I have thick, wavy hair. This clip works well. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This is worth the extra cost because it holds my hair better than any clip I&#x27;ve had. Usually I have to reclip my hair every hour or so. With this clip, I don&#x27;t need to do that at all. I put it on, and forget about it until it is time to take it off.    I just wish they offered other colors.</li>
    <li> Nice little clip that keeps hair in place securely and the color blends are quite attractive from any angle.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and holds without slipping. Worth the extra few dollars.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I was desperate for a clip that was pretty and wouldn&#x27;t stab me in the head and cause excruciating pain while driving ( headrest).  Love the color, fact it doesn&#x27;t stab me and it&#x27;s  ability to stay put but... buyer beware, I didn&#x27;t heed the warnings from other reviewers that the clip was small. It is. Needs to be about another 1-1 1/2 inches bigger and would get 5 stars and top ranking on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I did read the size under manufacturers description but I guess I need to get out the ruler next time to really see how small 3 1/4 inches is...You&#x27;re going to look for your ruler now aren&#x27;t you?</li>
    <li> The clip is very small and will not hold a lot of hair.  A complete waste of money, sending this back.  Totally over priced, not worth $2.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this clip. The clasping action is super strong and this is the first clip I&#x27;ve ever used that stays put in my hair. It seems to be really well made, and I will be ordering more like it.</li>
    <li> I like it!  It&#x27;s very pretty and it holds my hair well.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I thought.  I bought this thinking for $10, it should be pretty nice! The description said &amp;#34;large&amp;#34;.  My Asian hair can only be held up by a sturdy and &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; hair claw.  When I received this, way overpacked (is someone going to tell Amazon that the waste on their packing is incredible!) I might add, I thought, large box, large hair claw!  Wrong!  This hair claw is about 3 inches long and 1 inch tall!  I actually started laughing when I saw it!  Anyway, I promptly printed the return label and sent it off to the Amazon cemetery!</li>
    <li> Looks beautiful but unfortunately it arrived broken so its unusable.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, and she really likes it.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair and was looking for something substantial. This clip is medium sized but is one of the few clips than can hold up my hair. I even wear it lap-swimming everyday and it holds every hair in place. It has smooth edged claws which prevents digging into my scalp unlike other products I&#x27;ve purchased. Attractive, well-made, WORKS. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> arrived on time. Looks better than picture.  Nice and functional.  I will definitelly buy more from this company.</li>
    <li> I have long and thick hair and it secures my hair very good.</li>
    <li> Regarding the look of this clip - it&#x27;s beautiful. Prettier in person than in the photos. But it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair that well. Disclaimer: I have very fine, very thick, and very slick hair - I have a rough time finding claw clips that hold my hair in a french twist. This one does an ok job, but not great. I have others that hold my hair better. But for the person with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair, I&#x27;m sure it would be just fine. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and love it. The design is lovely. The clip seems a bit small, but it does hold a lot of hair. The quality is pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected. My fault for not measuring. I like the color and use it occasionally to wear my hair up on casual shopping or jeans days. It has a good grip for medium length hair, but might not hold long or thick hair securely.</li>
    <li> This clip is amazing! I have thick but fine hair and the clip hold my hair tightly in place. I plan on purchasing more for gifts.</li>
    <li> Strong, versatile coloring, holds my fine hair.  I use it for &#x27;better&#x27; occasions and with a wider variety of clothes.</li>
    <li> have especially thick hair and this works great</li>
    <li> I choose this clips because of the unique marbling effect and I was not disappointed. Looks even better than the picture and is built sturdy so you don&#x27;t need to worry about it breaking easy.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair. Nice looking. Not too flimsy. Seems ok!</li>
    <li> My hair goes to just past my shoulder blades and is average in thickness.  This clip is pretty good. It has a strong spring, which most clips don&#x27;t, but falls short of being perfect because it is just a little to small.</li>
    <li> I recently got my hair cut fairly short after having it shoulder length for years.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this clip would hold the shorter hair up.  A few strands came loose but overall it worked beautifully.  It gets a good grip on my hair, something no other claw clip has been able to do.  I do have a lot of hair but it is fine and this worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very lovely, well-made clip that hopefully will last a while (at least until I lose it).&lt;br /&gt;I have fine shoulder length hair and it works really well and stays in place.</li>
    <li> A great hair clip, Just like all of the Karina brand clips, it has the right amount of hold and it looks nice, not cheap like the ones at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Karina makes great quality clips.  I have been purchasing this brand sine the 1990&#x27;s and the quality is consistent , so far.  I  wear a set of  Karina clips everyday to keep my thick wavy hair up in a bun.  The springs last 5-6 years.  The comb teeth are smooth and gentle on the scalp and hair. The photo does not do  justice to this this pair of clips, they have a lovely gold, silver, and bronze marbling.</li>
    <li> very comfortable and pretty..goes wth everything....so easy to put up your hair and looks very nice and keeps you cooler in hot weather.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at the price for one little clip, but it&#x27;s hard to find things that are well made. I was pleasantly surprised and so bought another!</li>
    <li> This is a great clip.  I have long, thick hair and it hold my hair nicely.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, it was a stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> Beautiful Clip...it was just as I&#x27;d hoped, and was promptly shipped!</li>
    <li> Great for lots of fine thin hair.  Pretty and well made.</li>
    <li> Love how strong this clip is! Keeps my hair in place. Should have bought more</li>
    <li> My hair tangles very easily so some hair clips just don&#x27;t work well.  This one is perfect - not too large, not too small.  Holds in my hair very well (i.e., doesn&#x27;t start to &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; within minutes).  I can easily go on for hours, without having to re-adjust the hair clip once.  Would love to own the same one in a different color, as well.</li>
    <li> It is a very Nice clip.Looks good and holds hair really well.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Love it and use often!</li>
    <li> Great light weight clip for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> for the price this is the best clip ever.  extremely attractive.  holds good amount of hair.  just love it and highly reccomend</li>
    <li> pretty with a tight hold</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected, but well-made, strong clip.</li>
    <li> This is a very pretty, sturdy hair claw. I like to wear my medium long hair up in a twist, and this does the trick -- holds it well. It has an iridescent color, a little sparkly, very nice. And, it&#x27;s made in France.</li>
    <li> wrong size needed bigger.</li>
    <li> So pretty and works great! The perfect size!</li>
    <li> This clip is really well made and gorgeous. It&#x27;s looks and feels different from cheap clips you get at discount stores.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I lost mine during my recent trip so I will order 2nd one.</li>
    <li> Love Karina hair clips!  Need to build a collection, love them!!❤️</li>
    <li> Ive always bought Karina clips bc they r great quality. BUT WWOOWW!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This hair clip is so so very BEAUTIFUL!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful and elegant hair clip. It holds the hair very well, hopefully the quality will last. Personally, I prefer it somewhat smaller as I do not hold all of my hair up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have enough hair to use clip.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and can holds all of my hair very well.</li>
    <li> 2 stars for being pretty, no more than that because it&#x27;s SO small!!</li>
    <li> bought the gorgeous vintage, the france luxe and monet claw clip for my daughter who has very thick hair.  she loved them</li>
