      <li>Great light travel dryer.</li>

      <li>Nice and compact.</li>
      <li>When it comes to travel accessories, more power is not always a good idea...  </li>
      <li>, it fits on nicely, and you don&#x27;t have to take it off to stow it.  </li>
      <li>For me, this had two very important features:</li>
      <li>I purchased this as a replacement to an identical one that I have used for more years than I can count.</li>
      <li>I asked her to try it before the trip to make sure it worked.  </li>
      <li>Even one of the posted reviews chose it for that reason and was satisfied.  </li>
      <li>It weighs next to nothing (especially good for carry ons)</li>
      <li>I do bunches of research before I buy most products.  </li>
      <li>I love the concerntrator</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>So far so good!  </li>
      <li>This is the perfect little hairdryer, but don&#x27;t let the size fool you.</li>

      <li>full size wattage hair dryers are too strong for a guys shorter hair.</li>

      <li>This one overcomes those problems, producing a reasonably strong air flow, balanced by hot but not burning heat, so that styling is easy.  </li>
      <li>(e careful it is very warm) and put it back on and it seemed to snap in place much more securely (while it was warm and</li>
      <li>Very light and small which was great for packing and did the trick for what I needed it for.</li>
      <li>I wasted good money!</li>
      <li>Most travel dryers rely too much on very hot air, almost to the point of frying your hair, without producing enough of an air stream to help you shape or smooth your hair while it&#x27;s drying.  </li>
      <li>This is really nice for travel, which I do constantly.  </li>
      <li>The 1600 model is WAY too big, to actually travel with, this 1200 is plenty of power, very quiet, good ion output for smooth hair, and has a nice draw-string bag to keep it neatly in your travel bag.    </li>
      <li>Good value and a sturdy and pretty powerful little piece of equipment.</li>
      <li>This hair dryer is about as effective if not more than my full size tourmaline hair dryer!</li>

      <li>it is a good little thing.</li>
      <li>, I am extremely pleased with it as a travel dryer, for several reasons.  </li>
      <li>Funny</li>
      <li>And the drying quality is much better than the standard hotel bathroom offering.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ready!</li>
      <li>However, warning that the air is extremely hot if you don&#x27;t like to use really hot air on your hair.</li>
      <li>but I overall, really think its functional and love the size/weight...</li>
      <li>Nice travel dryer, but a little underpowered for what I prefer in the home.  </li>
      <li>With this hair dryer, she reports that her hair drys much faster, and probably as a result, has no frizzies.  </li>
      <li>It runs too fast and overheats immediately on non-US voltages.</li>
      <li>You really have to tap the diffuser into place until it snaps on.</li>
      <li>yet I don&#x27;t feel I am sacrificing too much power in the process.</li>
      <li>I try to travel carry-on only as much as possible, and this works nicely even for a 4-5 day trip.  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice hair dryer and extremely small and light &amp; easy to handle so not only does it save space and weight in your luggage, it is easier to hold &amp; less tiring on your arms.  </li>
      <li>It is working great for me for everyday, and of course it is small in size and easy for traveling.  </li>
      <li>I originally mistakenly purchased the \\&quot;big brother\\&quot; of this item - a 1600 watt beast.  </li>
      <li>This one is a must buy for a real traveler - steer clear of the similar looking higher wattage unit unless you want to pack an extra bag for your hairdryer alone :-)    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve compared this to numerous hotel dryers, in the states and overseas, and have only once found a hotel dryer that was better.  </li>
      <li>I expected far better for the price.</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t agree with reviewers who say it&#x27;s good enough to be their everyday hairdryer (it can&#x27;t compare to my Solano)</li>
      <li>This blower is super tiny, but worked while I was in Paris.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I used a Franzus 1200 watt travel hair dryer for many years as my everyday hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>The 1600w version might work nicely when packing space is not a priority, but this one did a good job and takes up little room due to its small size and folding handle.</li>
      <li>But those pluses are negated by two simple problems: it does NOT work overseas as advertised (you will still need a voltage converter) and the attachment diffused falls right off.</li>
      <li>Used this for a recent one-week trip and it worked fine on short hair (did not use attachment).  </li>
      <li>got it brand new</li>
      <li>Love that it is so small and folds with concentrator nozzle attached.</li>
      <li>I had the same issue at first.  </li>
      <li>Additionally, one of the reasons I bought this hair drying was for the flat nozzle but that unfortunately never stayed on well.</li>
      <li>Over the years I have gotten countless compliments on how shiny my (very long) hair is, I attribute that to this powerful but gentle ceramic-ionic hairdryer.</li>
      <li>Alot loud but does the job.</li>
      <li>Works on my natural curly hair.</li>
      <li>It is small and very lightweight, but powerful.</li>
      <li>What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really bummed that they would have a product that is so purely made.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also quieter than most, small and extremely lightweight.  </li>
      <li>I would probably go with a stronger travel sized blow dryer next time around, but if you don&#x27;t have really thick hair it would probably work just fine.</li>
      <li>The question here is this: is this worth the asking price when small size hair dryers can be purchased for as low as $20 these days?  </li>
      <li>I used to sometimes pack my much-too-heavy-for-travel Solano, because I couldn&#x27;t really count on prior travel dryers to manage my hair, but this little thing works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t add excess weight to the luggage.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice travel dryer, but a little underpowered for what I prefer in the home.  I haven&#x27;t had any trouble keeping the diffuser on, like some of the other reviewers.  You really have to tap the diffuser into place until it snaps on.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer solely because it is dual voltage and the product description lists that it comes with a volume diffuser.  Funny enough I received my dryer today and guess what????  No diffuser!  I have a dual voltage hair dryer so I wasted $55.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement to an identical one that I have used for more years than I can count. This is the perfect little hairdryer, but don&#x27;t let the size fool you. It is small and very lightweight, but powerful. The handle folds making it perfect for travel but I use it at home all of the time, it is my only hairdryer. Over the years I have gotten countless compliments on how shiny my (very long) hair is, I attribute that to this powerful but gentle ceramic-ionic hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a 5 month trip around the world. Very light and small which was great for packing and did the trick for what I needed it for. However, warning that the air is extremely hot if you don&#x27;t like to use really hot air on your hair. Additionally, one of the reasons I bought this hair drying was for the flat nozzle but that unfortunately never stayed on well. I did use it for my trip and it never broke on me and would take it again for vacation.</li>
    <li> Good power, but I have lost a lot of hair into the suction fan! It sucks my long hair right in by the chunks, therefore I hate this blowdryer. I wasted good money!</li>
    <li> I am used to working with professional styling products and my hair is quite thick. This blower is super tiny, but worked while I was in Paris. It took twice as long to dry my hair but it did the job okay. I would probably go with a stronger travel sized blow dryer next time around, but if you don&#x27;t have really thick hair it would probably work just fine.</li>
    <li> Great light travel dryer. I&#x27;m happy with it. Good value and a sturdy and pretty powerful little piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> This very small 1200 wat ultra light travel hair dryer does the job fast on my thick medium lengthed hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a toy.  The &amp;#34;concentrator&amp;#34; falls off and that&#x27;s the good news.  I blew it (no pun intended) because what I wanted was a lightweight small dryer that I could turn down when it got near my face.  What I got was a tinny and tiny toy.</li>
    <li> This is really nice for travel, which I do constantly.  I love the concerntrator, it fits on nicely, and you don&#x27;t have to take it off to stow it.  It is really small and compact.  I try to travel carry-on only as much as possible, and this works nicely even for a 4-5 day trip.  And the drying quality is much better than the standard hotel bathroom offering.</li>
    <li> I do bunches of research before I buy most products.  I read a lot of good things about blow dryers that use ceramic/ionic/etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my daughter to take on an extended trip.  I asked her to try it before the trip to make sure it worked.  She has long blonde hair.  With her regular hair dryer, she reported that it made her hair \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot;.  With this hair dryer, she reports that her hair drys much faster, and probably as a result, has no frizzies.  In short, she loves this blow dryer, and it is now her \\&quot;regular\\&quot; blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I originally mistakenly purchased the \\&quot;big brother\\&quot; of this item - a 1600 watt beast.  When it comes to travel accessories, more power is not always a good idea...  I sent that one back... The 1600 model is WAY too big, to actually travel with, this 1200 is plenty of power, very quiet, good ion output for smooth hair, and has a nice draw-string bag to keep it neatly in your travel bag.    This one is a must buy for a real traveler - steer clear of the similar looking higher wattage unit unless you want to pack an extra bag for your hairdryer alone :-)    VERY HAPPY with this dryer.</li>
    <li> I used a Franzus 1200 watt travel hair dryer for many years as my everyday hair dryer.  As a guy, I like the reduced power of a1200W dryer  standard full size wattage hair dryers are too strong for a guys shorter hair. When the Franzus finally quit working, and it seems to no longer be made, I found this one.  So far so good!  It is working great for me for everyday, and of course it is small in size and easy for traveling.  This hair dryer works perfectly for a guy.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Several reviewers remarked that the concentrator won&#x27;t stay attached.  I had the same issue at first.  It fell off while I was using it....I picked it up (e careful it is very warm) and put it back on and it seemed to snap in place much more securely (while it was warm and pliable).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy, I purchased this after my recent trip to Europe and the array of mediocre to terrible hairdryers offered in hotels.  Next trip I&#x27;ll be ready!</li>
    <li> Used this for a recent one-week trip and it worked fine on short hair (did not use attachment).  A little lighter weight than my previous travel dryer, compact for packing, and noise level was moderate. The 1600w version might work nicely when packing space is not a priority, but this one did a good job and takes up little room due to its small size and folding handle. Hope this helps. 7/28/13 update: dryer has worked great for the occasional trips I bought it for. 1/10/14 update: dryer continues to work with no problems. A family member needed a travel dryer and bought this one on my recommendation. Another family member borrowed hers and is buying one of her own.</li>
    <li> Not quite as outstanding as the full size version, has fewer settings, but the only travel dryer I&#x27;ve seen with a real diffuser.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love that it is so small and folds with concentrator nozzle attached. Good power. Dries my hair thoroughly in less than 10 min and I can get away without using my straightener if in a hurry. Best price found here on Amazon too!</li>
    <li> Will have to say, we bought this specifically as it was the only small travel dryer that listed an included DIFFUSER.  Even one of the posted reviews chose it for that reason and was satisfied.  Unfortunately as another reviewer indicated, there was no included diffuser as listed on the ad.  There is a small cheap attachable concentrator (entirely different device) that is made of thin flexible plastic and pops off the dryer if you just brush it with your fingernail.  Quite flimsy and connects poorly.  I expected far better for the price.</li>
    <li> The thing works...it is a good little thing. Feather lite. Great carrying pouch included. Alot loud but does the job. I like it with noozle on (praying it stays on). Works on my natural curly hair. SO it&#x27;s not all frizzy and diva&#x27;s-live like! The handle is really stiff (i pray that dont break) but I overall, really think its functional and love the size/weight...cant go wrong. I would tell a friend!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it brand new and it burnt up.  I did not keep the packaging so now i am stuck with it.  What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really bummed that they would have a product that is so purely made.</li>
    <li> The question here is this: is this worth the asking price when small size hair dryers can be purchased for as low as $20 these days?  For me, this had two very important features: it really is tiny and yet it is also very powerful.  It weighs next to nothing (especially good for carry ons) yet I don&#x27;t feel I am sacrificing too much power in the process. But those pluses are negated by two simple problems: it does NOT work overseas as advertised (you will still need a voltage converter) and the attachment diffused falls right off. It doesn&#x27;t even have a prong converter - it&#x27;s standard US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this in both the EU and the UK with prong converters. It runs too fast and overheats immediately on non-US voltages. All the while sputtering on and off, fast and slow.  I discarded it has being unsafe and am now out the money I thought would be used toward a viable travel option.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is about as effective if not more than my full size tourmaline hair dryer! Nice and compact.</li>
    <li> I held off reviewing this hairdryer until I had spent considerable time using it, including overseas on 220V systems.  While I don&#x27;t agree with reviewers who say it&#x27;s good enough to be their everyday hairdryer (it can&#x27;t compare to my Solano), I am extremely pleased with it as a travel dryer, for several reasons.  Most travel dryers rely too much on very hot air, almost to the point of frying your hair, without producing enough of an air stream to help you shape or smooth your hair while it&#x27;s drying.  They&#x27;re also often too noisy.  This one overcomes those problems, producing a reasonably strong air flow, balanced by hot but not burning heat, so that styling is easy.  It&#x27;s also quieter than most, small and extremely lightweight.  I&#x27;ve compared this to numerous hotel dryers, in the states and overseas, and have only once found a hotel dryer that was better.  I used to sometimes pack my much-too-heavy-for-travel Solano, because I couldn&#x27;t really count on prior travel dryers to manage my hair, but this little thing works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t add excess weight to the luggage.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hair dryer and extremely small and light &amp; easy to handle so not only does it save space and weight in your luggage, it is easier to hold &amp; less tiring on your arms.  But while small, it still draws enough power to blow fuses if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m traveling to Australia and needed a smaller hair dryer with diffuser because I have curly hair.  This arrived, and though the size was great, it does not come with a diffuser.  It comes with a concentrator which, if you have curly hair, you know is not the same and is completely useless.  I never write reviews but was so mad that it didn&#x27;t come with what it said that I felt like I had to.</li>
