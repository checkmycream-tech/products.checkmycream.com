      <li>, Aqua Sparkle Scent has a nice lather but the scent is another</li>
      <li>I liked this rather a lot.</li>

      <li>so you may be able to pick it up</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
      <li>It’s just okay</li>
      <li>However, it is not my favorite body wash.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love Caress products.</li>
      <li>A refreshing smell.  </li>
      <li>My favorite body wash moisturizes my skin and does not leave my skin needed lotion after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>And latter&#x27;s wonderfully.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overly flowerly, but smells very clean and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>It has a very unique smell that I can’t pinpoint.</li>
      <li>I love that the new Caress body wash smells great</li>
      <li>I thought that something with &amp;#34;lilac blossom and aquamarine essence&amp;#34; scents would be lightly scented and refreshing.  </li>
      <li>I did not find the scent so powerful, I might be inclined to like the product since it did feel nice.  </li>
      <li>love to use body wash products and am not disappointed with this one.</li>
      <li>The bottle is shaped well and dispenses easily.</li>
      <li>: Strong scent, and</li>
      <li>She has used many many different liquid soaps and this is a good</li>
      <li>Caress always makes very nice body washes, it lathers well, cleans well and rinses well leaving your skin clean and not dried out like some do.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of cheap shampoo.</li>
      <li>All that in a shower is worth the price as the Aqua Sparkle lather gives you much more lather than a bar of soap.  </li>
      <li>: Though the fragrance is light, I don’t like it.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the scent while I&#x27;m using it, but as soon as the lather washes away, the scent does too.  </li>
      <li>There are four important things I look for when it comes to a body wash: scent, lather, how the lather washes off and how my skin feels afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It’s fine, but nothing too special.</li>
      <li>It lingered in the bath and hallway long after my shower was over, which would be great if it was a scent</li>
      <li>I have used the original scent of Caress for years and I am a dedicated user</li>
      <li>I feel clean, but like I need lotion after using this body wash.</li>
      <li>Will keep you clean.</li>
      <li>This Aqua Sparkle has a nice light fragrance and cleans your skin so that you feel fresh and soft.  </li>
      <li>fresh, clean scent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m OK with that as I wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle the scent if it stayed present longer.  </li>
      <li>I guess it’s a good thing that you can walk out of the bathroom, walk right back in and not smell it at all.</li>
      <li>I would normally choose a more floral scented body wash but thought this might be used by both my husband and myself.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>This smells so good and stayed with me long after the shower was over.</li>
      <li>I knew that I was a fan of not only the original scent but the new scents that are now available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent that not only smells great but also keeps your skin nice and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed this new scent as well.  </li>
      <li>first time I used it I found it to be refreshing and invigorating, much more so than my regular body wash.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the strong scent while showering especially since it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin afterwards and compete with your perfume.  </li>
      <li>It lathers up nicely and there&#x27;s no residue left.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does what bath wash is supposed to and smells good. Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> Great basic household staple delivered directly to your door.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with the smell of this! I really wish they would make a body lotion in the same fragrance.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and stayed with me long after the shower was over. Great choice for body wash. Aqua Sparkle</li>
    <li> My wife said that she likes it.  She has used many many different liquid soaps and this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;It was hard to get her to explain much more, but I think for her it would come down to price.</li>
    <li> I use caress bar soap but had not tried their body wash until now.  I would normally choose a more floral scented body wash but thought this might be used by both my husband and myself.  I usually like lilac scents anyway, which is one of the focuses of this body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I found it to be refreshing and invigorating, much more so than my regular body wash.  My skin was left smooth and a little tingly after my shower, which I liked.  The fragrance didn&#x27;t stay with me as long as some of my other washes, but this was good as it didn&#x27;t clash with my other scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again?  Yes, and I would like to try some of the other Caress body washes as well.  It lathered nicely, made my shower very enjoyable, and left my skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> I received this at a discounted price through Amazon in exchange for an honest review. It smells great. I love Caress products. They leave my skin very soft with no film. I am buying more to give as gifts. The bottles are quite big and will last quite awhile. Thank You</li>
    <li> I am always excited to try a new soap or body wash. There are four important things I look for when it comes to a body wash: scent, lather, how the lather washes off and how my skin feels afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Scent: this Caress body wash is supposed to smell like &amp;#34;Lilac Blossom and Aquamarine Essence&amp;#34;. While I am not sure exactly what that means, it does smell flowery. This is not necessarily my preferred scent, but I do like it. The smell does get a little overpowering when you are first applying it to your body, but that fades quickly as you use it. The scent only faintly lingers on your body and not for long after your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Lather: the body wash has a decent lather. It begins to lather almost immediately upon using and lathers up even more as you scrub it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*How the lather washes off: It washes off very easily with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*How my skin feels afterwards: this is where this body wash disappoints me. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like soap does, but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel moisturized either. I feel clean, but like I need lotion after using this body wash. My favorite body wash moisturizes my skin and does not leave my skin needed lotion after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent body wash. I will finish the bottle and I would purchase it again if it was on sale. However, it is not my favorite body wash. It needs to moisturize the skin more and I would prefer a different scent.</li>
    <li> I use Caress Body Wash a lot and like it.  It lathers well and a little goes a long way.  It rinses off well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I enjoyed this new scent as well.  It&#x27;s not overly flowerly, but smells very clean and refreshing.  It is strong so if you are sensitive to scents you might not like this, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last for long either so I have no problem with it.</li>
    <li> The Caress body Wash Aqua Sparkle is a new twist on an old classic. I have used the original scent of Caress for years and I am a dedicated user so when I saw that there was new scents I was kind of skeptical but as soon as I used it I knew that I was a fan of not only the original scent but the new scents that are now available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent that not only smells great but also keeps your skin nice and moisturized. I love that the new Caress body wash smells great but I love that it also keeps your skin hydrated and you smell fresh throughout the entire day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for anything that&#x27;s blue colored. This one is a lovely shade of blue and smells excellent. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks and I&#x27;m enjoying it. The scent is very nice and fragrant but not overpowering. It lathers up nicely and there&#x27;s no residue left. I&#x27;ve been using bars of soap for the past year so this is a nice switch.</li>
    <li> fresh, clean scent.  Lathers up great.  Body soap to use with a bath sponge.  I would recommend this soap to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had used Caress products in the past but with switching to liquid body wash I no long bought Caress.  Now that I&#x27;ve tried this product I am a Caress customer again.  This body wash is very rich and lathers nicely.  I absolutely love the strong scent while showering especially since it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin afterwards and compete with your perfume.  My skin feels soft and clean after use.</li>
    <li> Cleans well and has a nice floral smell but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after you wash it off</li>
    <li> Very small amount of this body wash gives good lather. But no smell, yet good to use.</li>
    <li> I thought that something with &amp;#34;lilac blossom and aquamarine essence&amp;#34; scents would be lightly scented and refreshing.  The scent of the product is so completely overwhelming that my husband inquired about the smell from the hallway outside the bathroom.  It lingered in the bath and hallway long after my shower was over, which would be great if it was a scent we enjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it did feel nice on my skin, but the scent was so overwhelming and just seemed so odd that I was not able to enjoy it.  I can&#x27;t think of a good way to describe the scent other than that it was more like something I would have expected from a household cleaning product that was trying to overpower a chemical smell with something that smells more organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I did not find the scent so powerful, I might be inclined to like the product since it did feel nice.  Unfortunately, I am not able to get past the scent.</li>
    <li> A good soap.  I have not used bar soap in a very long time.  A refreshing smell.  Will keep you clean.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells amazing! And latter&#x27;s wonderfully. Will repurchase whenever I run out, which will take me awhile since the bottle is huge!</li>
    <li> I loved this product and will buy more of it.  The scent is nice and not to heavy. This is a repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> This body wash lathers up really well with just a small amount.  I enjoy the scent while I&#x27;m using it, but as soon as the lather washes away, the scent does too.  I&#x27;m OK with that as I wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle the scent if it stayed present longer.  It does moisturize my skin quite well - to where I haven&#x27;t had to use moisturizer right after showering.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this body wash. It didn&#x27;t lather that well and the smell was too artificial. It didn&#x27;t really smell flowery at all. There are better body washes at a lower price than this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BIG fan of CARESS products. The new AQUA SPARKLE scented body wash is another favorite I have added to my collection! This product smells great, cleans effectively and leaves you feeling refreshed. All fans of CARESS need to add this product to their collection. 5/5 stars!</li>
    <li> This body wash is very pleasant to use. It has a lovely scent. It lathers (and cleans) well. It works well with a razor in the shower. It can double as a bubble bath as well. Love the color!</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of this from the bottle. However on the skin, it turned a bit &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; and fake smelling. It was a disappointment.  The scent dissipated when rinsed off and didn&#x27;t linger on the skin at all. Which is good for the plastic smelling scent but I wish it had smelled as pretty as it does from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good quality body wash. It&#x27;s very thick and concentrated, so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  It leaves you clean and soft without any dryness.  The bottle is easy to hold and open with wet/soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wish the scent stayed nice but the quality of the body wash makes up for it!</li>
    <li> Caress makes good products, so I was happy to try this one and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> Caress always makes very nice body washes, it lathers well, cleans well and rinses well leaving your skin clean and not dried out like some do. Their &amp;#34;Aqua Sparkle&amp;#34; does as mentioned above, but for some reason they felt they needed a gimmick, so they came up with this name and claim that it has &amp;#34;Aqua essence&amp;#34;. What is aqua essence, who knows, it&#x27;s never explained on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gimmicky name aside, it&#x27;s a good product but I only gave it 4 stars because it claims to have lilac scent, and it doesn&#x27;t. It has a pleasant aroma, but in my opinion it&#x27;s not lilac.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works well.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice, good suds, and very clean.  Rinsing nicely, too.  I have dry skin, especially in the winter months, and this is not drying at all.  I am usually pleased with Caress products, and this one does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> It has a refreshing aroma,  need very little to create nice lather.  Didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I started using Caress way back in the day when it first came on the market and have used it faithfully since.  I do prefer the bars to the body wash but they both work equally good.  It&#x27;s just a preference thing.  This Aqua Sparkle has a nice light fragrance and cleans your skin so that you feel fresh and soft.  I might be prejudiced since this is the only type of soap I will use but 30+ years of using this brand name must say something good.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant, reasonably-priced body-wash with a fresh lilac fragrance.  It&#x27;s kind of hard to review products like body-wash; it either gets you clean or it doesn&#x27;t.  This does the job.</li>
    <li> Caress Body Wash in an 18 ounce container is a good size to have many refreshing showers.  It contained a liliac blossom and aquamarine essence that leaves you feel invigorating.  All that in a shower is worth the price as the Aqua Sparkle lather gives you much more lather than a bar of soap.  This is why I use Body Wash all the time in the showe.  I also use a net ball instead of a wash cloth and this extra netting takes care of dry skin. The Caress Body Wash has a delicate scent and leaves your skin so refreshed and clean.  Give thid a try you will love it.</li>
    <li> PROS: I liked the color. It lathers very well and it hasn’t dried out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Though the fragrance is light, I don’t like it. It’s a bit green in smell. It reminds me of cheap shampoo. I guess it’s a good thing that you can walk out of the bathroom, walk right back in and not smell it at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells so good. I thought the bottle would be bigger than it actually was. I am not complaining at all.</li>
    <li> I liked this rather a lot. I usually use Bath &amp; Body Works products, so I&#x27;m spoiled with concentrated body wash that lasts forever. The last time I bought an inexpensive alternative, I was not at all impressed; it was so watered down that I used it up very quickly, making it cost more, not less, than my usual despite its per-ounce price advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Strong scent, and I loved the scent, although I have no idea what &amp;#34;aquamarine&amp;#34; smells like; that&#x27;s a rock. As far as I know, sparkles don&#x27;t smell, either. But it is nice. Reasonably concentrated, if not as much as my usual choices. More in the container, so the balance puts it about on par with a smaller Bath &amp; Body Works bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I prefer a smaller, more concentrated bottle, because water is readily available in my shower and I don&#x27;t like using up cabinet space. Other than that, there&#x27;s really not a con to list; this product is just fine. It&#x27;s a poor choice for anyone with a fragrance sensitivity, but you already knew that, right?</li>
    <li> Oh man this smells soooooo good! And it leaves the skin soft!</li>
    <li> Great item and great price, would purchase from this seller again</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother- she loves lilacs (her favorite) and loves the body wash!</li>
    <li> great bottle,gorgeous hue ,great lather but the fragrance is bland,almost medicinal,as a caress item i just couldn&#x27;t believe how mediocre this body wash turned out to be</li>
    <li> I just love Caress Body Washes, my 10yr old daughter and I pick a different one every few weeks and have yet to be disappointed. I see several people here complaining that the scent doesn&#x27;t last on their skin... I suppose I might be in the minority with this but I don&#x27;t want it to. I love the smells during my shower, they remind me of a spa or vacation... but once I&#x27;m out and dried off I have my usual lotions or perfume to wear and don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like whatever scent I opted to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They lather well, my skin feels clean without being dried out and they are a good value for the size of the container. You do need to be careful when opening them though, I&#x27;ve had them splash up into my face and this one in particular burned my eye so badly when a tiny drop got in it that I had to end my shower and my eye hurt for hours after rinsing it out... so be mindful of that and don&#x27;t use these on any young children who might get them in their eyes.</li>
    <li> Caress Body Wash, Aqua Sparkle Scent has a nice lather but the scent is another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Infused with lilac blossom and aquamarine essence.&amp;#34;  I didn&#x27;t get that from this. It didn&#x27;t smell anything like Lilac blossom to me. Now the aquamarine essence part was there. And so was a flower scent. But it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Lilac Blossom&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. And it does a good job of cleaning my body. But just like the &amp;#34;Juicy escape&amp;#34; scent, it doesn&#x27;t smell like what it says it does.</li>
    <li> I like to use body was with a poof and this stuff really foams up. It expands in the poof and really lasts. I like it. It’s fine, but nothing too special. I won’t seek it out once it runs out or anything like that. It has a very unique smell that I can’t pinpoint. I’m not too big of a fan of the smell. It’s just okay and I won&#x27;t be recommending it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Review from wife…&lt;br /&gt;I love to use body wash products and am not disappointed with this one. It lathers well and smells wonderful. The bottle is shaped well and dispenses easily. This is a good product.</li>
    <li> Caress Body Wash, Aqua Sparkle is a great body wash, it lathers up fine. The frangrance is lilac and is very light. I wish that it was just a little bit stronger. But I am loosing my sense of smell so you may be able to pick it up more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel fresh after using it and had no allergic reactions to it. I am getting all three of the varieties of this body wash so I can pick whatever suits my mood. Makes me feel pampered too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a generous sized bottle so it should last a long time (18 ounces)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this body wash.</li>
    <li> Tried a different king from my regular brands! Smells good!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know...what has body wash ever done for me really? I&#x27;ve had ones with little microbeads (which are destroying the environment, apparently), ones with salt in them, ones with sugar, ones that were supposed to be uper-duper-ultra moisturizing, ones that were supposed to clarify my skin, ones that were supposed to wake me up, ones that said they would calm me down, ones that claimed to reduce my cellulite and ones that were supposed to tan my skin. None of these have ever really done anything other than wash me and make me smell better. The same goes for this, but what on earth did we really expect from soap?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what &amp;#34;Aqua Sparkle&amp;#34; is supposed to smell like, but apparently it&#x27;s like a soap-coated flower. It&#x27;s not unpleasant. I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One lost star because it did not make me sparkle.</li>
    <li> Smells good, gets you clean, and doesn&#x27;t make my skin itchy or tight. Doesn&#x27;t actually sparkle (thank goodness), in case you&#x27;re worried about that</li>
    <li> Seems to be kinda watery.. the smell last as long as you&#x27;re in the shower. But then again it&#x27;s only body wash.. How long is the scent of the soap supposed to last?</li>
    <li> Smells good. Not a big fan of high fragrance body wash but I really like this one.</li>
