      <li>this serum feels &amp; smell lovely.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this night serum.</li>
      <li>This is pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>Definately buying the full product!</li>
      <li>It also has a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s light, but doesn&#x27;t feel wimpy.</li>
      <li>product is not greasy at all and leaves your face feeling really smooth and refreshed.</li>
      <li>This serum works fantastic for after waxing.</li>
      <li>Then I&#x27;d have a new favorite product!</li>
      <li>It is extremely moisturizing and it evened out my skin tone and made it look so healthy and had a nice glow to it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a most have for new moms like myself.</li>
      <li>i love this product and can not find it in any store locally</li>
      <li>To tell you the truth i have no idea what this product claims to do but from the first time i used it my face had a glow and that is what keeps me using it every day</li>
      <li>Super smooth and has a dry touch.</li>
      <li>Also I have super sensitive skin and this serum doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
      <li>it really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  </li>
      <li>Recently I came across the Biore oil free moisture with SPF15 and realized it was the closest thing I&#x27;d ever found to the Proactiv lotion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Being 30, I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet</li>
      <li>-up.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs pretty quickly and leaves my facial skin</li>
      <li>I do recommend Aveeno&#x27;s Clear Complexion line and Ultra Calming line - both of which I used to clear up and calm my skin from the irritant in this product.</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this from someone and put it on my face overnight, you only need the smallest little bit for your whole face; the next morning my skin looked amazing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for post-sunburn, when I fail to avoid it.</li>
      <li>I have some slight skin crinkles on my forehead when I smile &amp; laugh and this seems to lessen their appearance.</li>
      <li>I would apply at night and wake up with my skin feeling silky soft.</li>
      <li>I have found that this stuff seems to help skin imperfections that are ready to heal to heal faster such as the left overs of a pimple, for example.</li>
      <li>small but small amount goes a long ways and good size for travel</li>
      <li>Now that I hit the big 5-0 I&#x27;ve been experiencing major puffs under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks younger, my pores smaller, my face fresher and it can make a pimple calm down overnight!</li>
      <li>i got a heavy moisturizer to use in between when skin feels super dry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I first started using this, I was very impressed. I would apply at night and wake up with my skin feeling silky soft. After a few days of use I had a bad cystic pimple pop up. After a week of using, I had several breakouts. It is non comedogenic but still irritated and broke out my skin. I stopped using and breakouts have healed and no new ones since.</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that this product is lite yet works, I absolutely love the scent! I wish they had a body lotion or spray that smelled as good as this night serum does. Then I&#x27;d have a new favorite product!</li>
    <li> To tell you the truth i have no idea what this product claims to do but from the first time i used it my face had a glow and that is what keeps me using it every day my skin looks great with out make-up will i buy this again yes i don&#x27;t want to run out the bottle does look small but small amount goes a long ways and good size for travel</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product and have been unable to find it in stores.  Hope that&#x27;s not a sign they are going to discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, nothing spectacular. No noticeable changes in skin one way or the other.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this from someone and put it on my face overnight, you only need the smallest little bit for your whole face; the next morning my skin looked amazing! It is extremely moisturizing and it evened out my skin tone and made it look so healthy and had a nice glow to it. Definately buying the full product!</li>
    <li> awesome! love it, my face feels so refreshed after using it. and its a good price, get it ! while you can</li>
    <li> this serum feels &amp; smell lovely. it&#x27;s light, but doesn&#x27;t feel wimpy. i got a heavy moisturizer to use in between when skin feels super dry. i do love this stuff! i&#x27;m not sure why they call it a night serum though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 and have used Proactiv Products for several years. Recently I came across the Biore oil free moisture with SPF15 and realized it was the closest thing I&#x27;d ever found to the Proactiv lotion. The Proactiv lotion is just so expensive for regular purchase but its hard to get another lotion as light and non-greasy with SPF. After getting and loving the Biore oil free lotion, I thought I&#x27;d try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being 30, I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet but I do have really fair skin and seem to freckle easily. I have found that this stuff seems to help skin imperfections that are ready to heal to heal faster such as the left overs of a pimple, for example. Also it seems to help my freckles go away. I only have them present in the summer usually, until the last couple years they&#x27;ve stopped going away as much in the winter. This seems to help fade the freckles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not greasy at all and leaves your face feeling really smooth and refreshed. I have some slight skin crinkles on my forehead when I smile &amp; laugh and this seems to lessen their appearance. At night I use the daily cleaning cloth then put this on afterward.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this night serum. I bought it completely on impulse one day and am now totally addicted! My skin looks younger, my pores smaller, my face fresher and it can make a pimple calm down overnight! Love it!</li>
    <li> I use this year round...the best serum I&#x27;ve had...repairs wind burn from skiing in the winter and soothes sunburn in the summer.  A must buy</li>
    <li> This is pretty good stuff. I use this serum under my make-up,&lt;br /&gt;as well as while sleeping and not wearing make-up.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs pretty quickly and leaves my facial skin&lt;br /&gt;feeling velvety.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again.</li>
    <li> Now that I hit the big 5-0 I&#x27;ve been experiencing major puffs under my eyes.  Just apply a small amount underneath each eye before bed &amp; puffy eyes are so much smaller!!!  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I used this years ago and loved it then I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. Then I discovered Amazon had it. This serum works fantastic for after waxing. I wax my eyebrows and sometimes get red and irritated and break out in pimples because I am allergic to the wax. (it doesn&#x27;t matter what wax I use I am allergic to them all) This serum clears up my skin overnight. No redness or pimples and the irritation is totally gone. It smells delicious! I bought a bunch I just don&#x27;t know what I will do when I can&#x27;t get them anymore. **Also I have super sensitive skin and this serum doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> I am always on the look out for bargain priced skin care items.  I am a no-frills person when it comes to skin care and feel that good products can be found in the drugstore.  Unfortunately, this one was not for me.  There was some ingredient in it that caused one of my worst adult-acne breakouts in a long time.  I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the ingredient was that caused the problem, but every time I put this product on my face I break out.  It also has a strong smell.  While it may be good for others without skin sensitivities this one is not for me.  I do recommend Aveeno&#x27;s Clear Complexion line and Ultra Calming line - both of which I used to clear up and calm my skin from the irritant in this product.</li>
    <li> Love this for my face. Can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m low-maintenance, but this stuff keeps me looking like I&#x27;m even lower maintenance than others. It&#x27;s also great for post-sunburn, when I fail to avoid it.</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion. Super smooth and has a dry touch. It smells nice and it&#x27;s very refreshing. I think it helps recover the skin from tough days.</li>
    <li> i was looking for a good skin serum....but this one wasn&#x27;t the one.  it really didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.  previously i tried aveeno triple boosting serum...but they no longer have it in stores...online it&#x27;s pricey....</li>
    <li> I just keep buying this product!  Lasts a long time due to need to use only as small drip per eye area.  Keeps puffiness and wrinkles down!  Quite firming for eyes for a quarter of the price compared to other products.</li>
    <li> The only one that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out! I love it! In the morning you can noticed the difference, seems like you had a great night of sleep (even when you didn&#x27;t) It&#x27;s a most have for new moms like myself. I also use it as lotion before putting my make up on.</li>
    <li> best stuff ever, hope I can always find it, I hate when a product is discontinued when it is soooooo good</li>
    <li> i love this product and can not find it in any store locally it works really well and does not feel heavy on your skin</li>
