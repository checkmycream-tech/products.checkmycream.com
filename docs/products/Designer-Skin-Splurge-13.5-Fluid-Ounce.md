    <li> This leaves my skin incredibly soft.  It does what it says it does.  It really gives my skin a beautiful glow.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It smells so good, and I got it for half of what they sell it for in the salons. It makes my skin feel great and I like the tan I&#x27;m getting. Plus it came with a packet of Kardasian Glow free!</li>
    <li> I thought it would smell better but it kind of has a funny scent but Im also very particular and dont like to smell like i tanned at all. But i got a great tan using it!</li>
    <li> My favorite indoor tanning product!! Dark beautiful color. Works big time to take the Casper out of my complexion!</li>
    <li> Same product at the salon is 4 times this amount. It enhances a great tan and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I like the way this lotion works. It gives you good color and the smell is pretty good. This is the third time that I bought this brand and I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a good tan.</li>
    <li> This lotion produces an even glowing you.  It smells great too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for awhile &amp; totally love it! It tans me nicely &amp; smells great! I would Highly recommend this product !</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel... Amazing bronze results! If you&#x27;re looking for a great deal use Tan for less!</li>
    <li> i got this for me and i love it</li>
    <li> Smells good, might use it as a perfume</li>
    <li> this lotion is $110 at the tanning salon and I bought it for $30...I have became so dark it is not funny and it aint that fake look either. this is really a 100 dollar bottle of lotion...I recommend it to anyone. the smell is so good you want to eat it and it does not make you stink when you get out of the tanning bed like some lotions out there. but you do have to wipe your hands really good between the fingers especially or it will stain your hands.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion will give you great results in just a few tans.  The fragrance is nice and the DreamWear Silicone Emulsion is top notch when it comes to keeping your skin super soft.</li>
    <li> lotion smells good. doesn&#x27;t stink &amp; didn&#x27;t turn me orange. product was worth the price. satisfied with purchase. probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but i rarely buy the same lotion twice.</li>
    <li> Not the best lotion ever. A disappointment from designer skin. Terrible smell.</li>
    <li> Has high levels of DHAs which CAN cause that orange look that no one wants... (Avoid by not religiously using it)  As well as the possibility you can get discoloration in-between your fingers if you don&#x27;t rub lotion in after application or wash them. Other than those downfalls this lotion smells fantastic, gives great color within a few sessions and has good moisturizers in it. Recommend for anyone wanting fast, dark color</li>
    <li> Leaves skin with a nice golden brown glow. Smell is ok. Goes on smooth.  Great price! It&#x27;s worth the buy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used in years.  Love the silicone, goes on smooth, and makes your skin feel like butter.  The smell is nice, kind of a luxurious olive oil type smell, and it really darkens your skin.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Goes on smoothly and smells very nice. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion but I would only recommend it if you already have a pretty good base tan. If you are pretty fair it can make you look a little orange.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion off of amazon thinking I was getting a great deal for $30 because my first bottle that I purchased at the salon was $92 and it was amazing and I loved it so much I wanted it again. however I just received my splurge from amazon and surprise surprise it is not the same lotion , the amazon lotion was deluted with some other lotion the color,smell and consistency isn&#x27;t the same as my previous lotion so this was a great let down . I thought this was the real deal but instead its just a knock off tanning product.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely let down customer ....but I guess you get what you pay for .</li>
    <li> Love how this smells!</li>
    <li> This product works really well, I have no complaints except that it smells like a teenager who put on too much perfume or body spray. Or like an old lady that bathed herself in perfume, the smell is just too much. It DOES work though!</li>
    <li> Smells great, but sometimes stains</li>
    <li> this is one of my least favorite tanning lotions and i have tried many.  i love designer skin and it&#x27;s the only brand of tanning lotion i will use but i won&#x27;t be buying this one again.  as far as bronzer it does work, but i hate the smell... it reminds me of men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> I really like it and I like it better than most bronzers for sure.  I am just not crazy about bronzers right now....love to have it and try it again but with no bronzers and use it as a intensifier.</li>
    <li> Scent--Gross, can&#x27;t stand the smell! Just no.&lt;br /&gt;Results--It&#x27;s nothing special, I didn&#x27;t notice much of any color. Maybe it would be better for someone who is fair skinned, or doesn&#x27;t want a ton of color.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! I first purchased it at STC at a very high price. Luckily, I shopped around and found it on Amazon at an amazingly low price! I received it very fast and its the same as the expensive type I bought in the tanning salon....smell, effect, packaging...the same - 100% real - no imitation. I love this product b/c it has a wonderful scent and has a built in bronzes with self-tanner tones. I am hooked on this lotion and will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
    <li> Nice for tanning, gets the color going... but the after smell is like corn chips. I have to use another lotion after to kill the smell till I can shower.</li>
    <li> Like the lotion, but questioning it&#x27;s authenticity.</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend and she says that she likes it.</li>
    <li> Worked ok , Did not like the smell at all will not buy this again</li>
    <li> 3 stars for smelling great even after tanning, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. I had read a few reviews with individuals saying they tried Splurge at their salon and it worked great, but buying this bottle sucked. And they were right...maybe not for everyone, but I tan very easily, and saw the bare minimum results. Not sure if its a different mixture or what but no bueno!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion!! It smells goof works really well if you like a bronzer and I received it earlier than expected! So happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;smells great, works great&lt;br /&gt;no greasy mess&lt;br /&gt;my skin is soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;sometimes I just use this and don&#x27;t tan</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because I saw that most of the reviews were positive and it&#x27;s from designer skin. When I got it, I immediately smelled it and it was a light smell and kind of smelled like a mix between cinnamon and vanilla. (Weird I know)  Also, the lotion doesn&#x27;t feel as though it has silicone in it as advertised. It&#x27;s a rather thin lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t say its runny but definitely not the consistency of a lotion that has silicone in it. The lotion does work well as far as tanning but the after tan smell is unbearable. I wouldn&#x27;t dare go anywhere after using this because it smells so bad. It smells like burnt cinnamon.&lt;br /&gt;So the conclusion is: If you plan to go straight home and wait at least an hour (or youll wash your tan off) and then take a shower and wash your body TWICE each time after using this to tan, then it&#x27;s a good lotion. BUT if you&#x27;re a woman like me who&#x27;s always on the go and doesn&#x27;t have an hour or so to kill time and then take a shower midday just to wash the stinky lotion off, I would pass on this lotion.</li>
    <li> I used this lotion for the first time yesterday. The salon recommended it. The instructions said to wash your hands after applying, so it worried me. How do you wash your hands when there&#x27;s no sink in your tanning room? I have two slight streaks on my hands that showed up this morning. I&#x27;m afraid to use it again now!</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells and After one use a friend commented on hard dark I am and I am naturally very white</li>
    <li> This lotion smells gross!! I didnt even go as far as using it to tan!! I find it hard to believe that Designer Skin has a product that smells this bad! It must be a fake!! Gross...Gross.. Gross! Buyer beware!!!</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this lotion. The silicone leaves you feeling soft and the bronzers leave you looking dark. Only complaint would be the fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever Purchased. It smells great and still smells awesome after I get done tanning. I dont think I will use a different lotion again. It awesome!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tarah Bishop</li>
    <li> Loved this lotion! Left my skin feeling silky and smooth. Smells very light, no bad ATO. If you have dry skin I recommend using this lotion with the silicon, great for moisturizing the skin while tanning.</li>
    <li> Was a little bit skeptical about purchasing this product but so far so good! It seems to be the real deal!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought one bottle and shared it with a friend, they both liked it so when she ran out we purchased another bottle.  The smell of the lotion is a little different than other lotions but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
    <li> Fast service. Great product</li>
    <li> I have become very pale after a few years of not tanning in a bed due to pregnancy.  I was afraid that a bronzer would leave streaks or leave me orange. This lotion did no such thing. I am enjoying this great lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I noticed a difference after only the first use. Im not to crazy about the scent but I dont dislike it either.  It doesnt have a bad ATO.  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love how is smells! It feels great leaves me with awesome color!!! Would buy it again today! Works wonderful love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion about 5 days ago and received it today, just as promised! It came in great condition, without any leakage and wrapped in plastic. I used it for the first time a couple of hours ago, and as of now I love it! I have used a lot of lotions and I have come to find out that Designer Skin is my favorite brand. I have already gotten a lot of color from one use so I&#x27;m excited to see what the results are after continued use. It made my skin soooo soft, and the smell isn&#x27;t bad like a lot of reviews say! However, it definitely does not have a \\&quot;light citrus\\&quot; smell, which is what Designer Skin describes it as. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Designer Skin and gave it a shot.  Smells nice but doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of their other lines.  May work better for a fairer skin person.  I will use it til it is gone but  will go back to Luminary or one of my other faves afterward.</li>
    <li> This is the SAME as sold in the tanning salon.  I have used Designer Skin lotions for years and this is the exact same product.  You have to be careful when applying though...wipe your hands or you&#x27;ll end up with brown palms! and make sure you apply it lightly and evenly or you will streak.  Great product!  Smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> My sister loves this stuff so i ordered her some as a gift. She really seems to like it, and Amazon was the cheapest i could find it.</li>
    <li> Shopped around for this at a lot of places, this company had the best price, and it was exacty like the salon was trying to sell me for 4 times that much!  Thanks for the bargain!!</li>
    <li> My wife should be a tanning sales person. She bought this..giving it the benefit of a doubt. She regrets it. All the bad reviews are correct. She said its a mixture of Splurge and banana boat self tanning summer color and something else. Leaves streaks. Smells horible</li>
    <li> love this lotion, it got me so dark. doesn&#x27;t turn you orange or smell bad. also I love how much cheaper it is than the salon!! and its the real lotion, NOT fake. smells great!</li>
    <li> For first time tanners or even if you need a cheap but effective lotion this is good. I personally dont like the smell, smells like burnt flesh but it doesnt leave streaks or make you orange so i with stood the smell since it was a decent lotion.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the bronzing is great! make sure to rub in all the way, especially around fingers</li>
    <li> My lotion was Was exactly as described brand new I did the standard free shipping an it actually got to me early. Very prompt. Extremely happy with my purchase.  As a whole I give it 5 stars an I love the lotion it smells great before an after tanning an great color after one use!!! Happy with it over all</li>
    <li> I got this and loved it. It not only moisturize your skin when you&#x27;re tanning, but it also helps with getting tan! It smells good, and just a little bit goes a long way! I would get this all the time!</li>
    <li> I gave Splurge 5 stars because I am not a picky person when it comes to tanning products. As long as it doesn&#x27;t stink or turn me orange, I am happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this lotion is the  Silicone, the scent and the \\&quot;glow.\\&quot; The Silicone leaves my skin feeling extremely soft and moisturized without that oily, greasy feel to it. The scent it is very fruity, light and pretty, which is great. After one use I did notice a difference in the pigment of my skin and I loved the touch of \\&quot;glow\\&quot; it left behind --- Almost as if it was a sun-kissed look from spending the day at the beach. I would recommend this product to anyone searching for a moderate Bronzer with great skin care system involved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re searching for a more dramatic look, any of Designer Skin&#x27;s brands with Silicone will leave your skin soft, but just search for one with Extreme Bronzing. If you&#x27;re looking for a less powerful look, search for an Accelerator (no dye bronzers involved, just accelerates the pigment of your natural tan) instead of a Bronzer. If you want to be REALLY dark, search for an Extreme Bronzer mixed with Extreme Tingle, it will do the trick - Just be aware that Tingle lotions make you feel like you&#x27;re on fire for a bit!</li>
    <li> Just like the sell for triple the cost in salons</li>
    <li> I am in love with designer skin tanning lotions.. they are all wonderful! I have used 2 different kinds before this one and loved both.. designer skin black 20x and designer skin spellbound are both wonderful! I admit i was sceptical of ordering this one after some of the reviews.. but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this lotion.. it&#x27;s fantastic, it smells wonderful,.. not like typical tanning products to me it smells more life perfume and it goes on smooth and leaves my skin silky smooth.. my husband even complimented the smell and how soft my skin as become since I started using this lotion and I have got numerous compliments on my tan .. I would highly recommend this lotion and all designer skin products to everyone but this is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this lotion at my local tanning salon. I got $35 knocked off the regional price so I bought it there instead of on here. Starting with the packaging- I loved a lot very girly and colorful.&lt;br /&gt;I love silicone in my tanning lotions makes it easier to apply and a little goes a long way. I noticed that my face was darker and the smell has stayed with me. I will only buy Designer Skin tanning lotions. I&#x27;ve had the best results with this brand. It&#x27;s worth the money if you ask me.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try out this lotion since it was new for 2013 and had silicone in it. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Designer Skin&#x27;s Black and Phoenician lotion. I love the thick silicone feel and both of the smells! Splurge was less than what I expected it to be. The formula was thinner than the two I used before and I didn&#x27;t really see a difference in my skin&#x27;s color after using this lotion. I decided to return it and go back to my beloved Phoenician. I like a lotion without bronzers so I don&#x27;t have to worry about carefully applying it and rubbing everything in to prevent streaks. They&#x27;re around the same price range so that was not a concern for me. Overall, I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to tanning fanatics.</li>
    <li> great lotion provides a nice bronze color on a level 3 bed. very soft on skin does not leave a sticky residue like others. great price from seller. Tanning salons sell this for about $100 and no one wants to spend that much on a lotion.</li>
    <li> Scent (2 stars): this lotion smells great in the bottle and light on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture (3 stars): silicone based, went in thin and disappeared leaving my skin very soft.  I prefer a thicker lotion to this one such as Conceited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color (5 stars): I became definitely darker with just one packet. A crisp, definitive line around the sticker and still there hours later. Impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ATO (1 star): (this was the deal breaker) the ATO of this lotion as soon as I got out of the bed was TERRIBLE. I will not buy a bottle of this lotion based solely on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall (3 stars): great lotion for color that made me much darker, but not thick enough or pretty smelling enough.  I would use another packet of this lotion if I thought I was hitting a tan wall.</li>
    <li> If you want natural looking fast beautiful  color that makes your skin feel like its ultimate thirst has been quenched this is the stuff!!!!!! Loooooove it. The only slight downside is that it does have a slight ATO. Its not as bad as &amp;#34;Color Bomb!&amp;#34;&#x27;s ATO but its defitnitely there. I hangout with friends after I tan and they dont notice, but if I were to get intimate with someone I wouldnt use this right beforehand. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely please and I recommend it for everyone!</li>
    <li> This product leaves you smelling great after you tan, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like toast,,lol.Fresh scent, and provides intense hydration with silicone emulsion base, that conditions.The bottle from this product looks a lil cheap, but the infused bronzer is great, so far : )</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion and how it feels after I use it. Expedient service and great service!</li>
    <li> Love it. Love the smell.  Same as the packets I bought at salon for a great price on amazon.</li>
    <li> The product does exactly what it promises. Easy to apply and smells great.  Nice, all-over tan - no blotches.  Definitely maximizes your time in the sun or tanning booth.</li>
    <li> Gives great color and can notice a difference in color within two uses. Did not make me look orange at all.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion.  It hellps speed up the tanning process and smells good too!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is not for beginning tanners when you&#x27;re trying to get rid of your winter pale. The bronzers streak and when you go to a salon and have to get dressed again right after tanning, the bronzers mostly get absorbed by your clothing. If you have been tanning for a month or built up some good color, this should be ok especially if you use it every time which would even out the color. The lotion does smell really good, but doesn&#x27;t eliminate after tan odor and if you apply it sloppily, you will get big brown blotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for no apparent reason, the word Splurge wiped right off the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t stick to the shiny silver in the middle vey well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this lotion, and its a fave at the salon I go to, but it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m greatly satisfied with Splurge, one being that the price is so much cheaper than going into an actual tanning salon. It also has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling horrible after tanning. The lotion leaves my skin feeling very soft which is something I also like as well.</li>
    <li> I have used several lotions mostly all designer skin brand. This is the only one I have ever had that leaves big noticeable streaks.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of weeks ago and i am not very happy with the outcome. It smells good when you put it on, but smells very bad and burnt after you tan. And if you don&#x27;t wipe the excess from in between your fingers it will stain orange. I scrub and scrub in the shower and it still smells burnt. The results of this tanning lotion are not worth all the other things associated with using it. I won&#x27;t buy this again. I like Designer Skin Queen Lotion or Bringing Sexy Black from Australian Gold</li>
    <li> Was not happy with the outcome of this product! the bottle is cute the smell is good but IT TURNS ME ORANGE!!! I dont think i will be purchasing from this seller anymore~!!</li>
    <li> i am so happy that i found you on amazon, i love bombshell and i love designer skin products!! i am so happy with my purchase, thank you sooooo much!! i am very satisfied!!! this has to be hands down the best Bronzer on the market!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Splurge lotion, and took it to my tanning salon. When they compared it to their lotion purchased directly from the manufacturer, it was clear that this lotion is a fake. They also advised me that this manufactured does not sell for online purchase, only to accredited salons. Don&#x27;t waste your money... You&#x27;ll be disappointed ... and pale :(</li>
