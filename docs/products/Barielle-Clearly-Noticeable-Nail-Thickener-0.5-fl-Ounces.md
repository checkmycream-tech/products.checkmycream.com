### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>EXCELLENT *SELLER! .THANK</li>
      <li>The best part, it has no pharmaldehide in it.</li>
      <li>and I have gotten-as well as seen-the huge improvement they also experienced.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite applying per instructions - it went on as nothing more than a kind of rubbery sort murky top coat.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but I love the difference it&#x27;s made in my nails</li>
      <li>After continued use I have found that although my nails do not feel thicker, they are holding together better than before.</li>
      <li>When they arrive I&#x27;ll give them a try and just hope they perform better than this</li>
      <li>I use and love  </li>
      <li>When they arrive I&#x27;ll give them a try and just hope they perform better than this one.</li>
      <li>Very good service &amp; fast shipping plus a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>So i bought the nail strengthening a growth cream from this brand, slathered it on my clean nails, then put this thickener on top.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still holding strong and holding that cream in my nails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s awesome, hands down.</li>
      <li>No polish or top coat or super glue would prevent this from happening.</li>
      <li>Honestly, super glue is working better that</li>
      <li>To show how good this is, I went to my old nail tech</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>: So, my initial review was on the right track - I just wanted to ensure I was being fair.</li>
      <li>It is the first time in years I am delighted to wear polish and actually haver to trim my nails.  </li>
      <li>I then used the Barielle clearly noticeable nail thickener for the top coat.</li>
      <li>It peels very easily and clearly from this most recent experience did not keep my nail from splitting.</li>
      <li>I found this product very good for protecting my nails, long lasting before it needed to be redone.  </li>
      <li>They cost a little more, but I have wonderful nails, and use their products almost everyday.</li>
      <li>A typical top coat stands up better than this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A typical top coat stands up better than this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>9/24/12: So, couldn&#x27;t get the acrylics on today but thought I was relatively safe with a nice thick coat of this on, I didn&#x27;t feel the split ridge.</li>
      <li>Several years ago I smashed my thumb in the safe at work and that nail has been splitting and cracking ever since.</li>
      <li>I smell the nail polish in my car ( where I first opened it ), and it&#x27;s on my finger as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;veknown this product for years and for those who don&#x27;t use the bright nail polish or like the &#x27;natural look&#x27;, but have weak and easily breakable nails</li>
      <li>They are much stronger and healthier.  </li>
      <li>He said that the product worked really well for him and already feels his nails are getting healthier.</li>
      <li>This product really works.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I am very hard on any nail product I have used so am impressed with it lasting even this long.</li>
      <li>great stuff for weak and fragile nails</li>
      <li>I also pair it with their nail strengthener cream for a extra help in keeping my nails long and strong.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 6 months and the lumps are almost completely gone!</li>
      <li>/&gt;After using this product for 10 days, the nail that usually splits has held together as well as if I had applied acrylics over the top.</li>
      <li>One nail completely splits down the middle which is why I wore acrylic nails for so many years.</li>
      <li>I had only been using the product for a couple of weeks, but I have seen very noticeable improvement in my nails.  </li>
      <li>The nail thickener hasn&#x27;t fixed that problem yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will take care of it, too.</li>
      <li>But hold on - Just out of the shower, the product was completely gone (?</li>
      <li>I start with a coat of the growth activator, let it dry at least 5 minutes, then applied a coat of the Barielle Natural nail camouflage, again letting it dry a good 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve just recently started using the Barielle products but am liking them so far.</li>
      <li>So far, it has been lasting about 4 or 5 days before I have to re-do.</li>

    <li> Save your money. This product did not work to strengthen nails. In fact, it peeled off. Still searching for a product that works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using the Barielle products but am liking them so far. I start with a coat of the growth activator, let it dry at least 5 minutes, then applied a coat of the Barielle Natural nail camouflage, again letting it dry a good 5 minutes. I then used the Barielle clearly noticeable nail thickener for the top coat. So far, it has been lasting about 4 or 5 days before I have to re-do. I am very hard on any nail product I have used so am impressed with it lasting even this long.</li>
    <li> .•:*PERFECT*:•.10 STARS*.•:*.100%RECOMMENDED!:•&lt;br /&gt;FAST SHIPPING! *EXCELLENT *SELLER! .THANK YOU*:•.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Beth</li>
    <li> So i bought the nail strengthening a growth cream from this brand, slathered it on my clean nails, then put this thickener on top. I thought it might peel off but here I am 1 week later and it&#x27;s still holding strong and holding that cream in my nails. It&#x27;s awesome, hands down. Two coats of this stuff and my nails aren&#x27;t thin as tissue paper anymore!</li>
    <li> I used this product to strengthen my formerly \\&quot;cellophane\\&quot; like nails. I have also given Barielle Noticeable Nail Strengthener products to four friends and I have gotten-as well as seen-the huge improvement they also experienced. I cannot say enough good things about this product. I also pair it with their nail strengthener cream for a extra help in keeping my nails long and strong. To show how good this is, I went to my old nail tech and she thought I had gone elsewhere for artificial nail tips because my nails were so long.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Barielle products. They cost a little more, but I have wonderful nails, and use their products almost everyday. Can also find those products in the drugstores now too.</li>
    <li> My nails split down into the nailbed and peel off like onion layers. This thickener has stopped that!  I have to cut my nails now. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> After having it on for about 5 days when I took it off my nails broke and the tip pealed so I havent used it since then.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  It is the first time in years I am delighted to wear polish and actually haver to trim my nails.  No more pealing or splitting.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, who wanted to stop his habit of nail biting. He said that the product worked really well for him and already feels his nails are getting healthier.</li>
    <li> Just got mine today。when I opened the package ( not the bottle), i found the liquid is everywhere in the package, almost half of them are gone.I smell the nail polish in my car ( where I first opened it ), and it&#x27;s on my finger as well. Definitely retuning it.</li>
    <li> I had only been using the product for a couple of weeks, but I have seen very noticeable improvement in my nails.  They are much stronger and healthier.  I bought this and the nail strengener cream.  They are working well together.</li>
    <li> keeps nails from breaking. on my third bottle.</li>
    <li> great stuff for weak and fragile nails</li>
    <li> 9/24/12: So, couldn&#x27;t get the acrylics on today but thought I was relatively safe with a nice thick coat of this on, I didn&#x27;t feel the split ridge. But hold on - Just out of the shower, the product was completely gone (?What?) I discovered as I severely snagged my split nail again. Honestly, super glue is working better that this stuff. Please don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;9/23/12: So, my initial review was on the right track - I just wanted to ensure I was being fair. Ten days later and yet again, that nail that splits down the middle snagged, very painful. This stuff goes on rubbery. It peels very easily and clearly from this most recent experience did not keep my nail from splitting. So it&#x27;s back to superglue until I can get the acrylics put back on as a protective barrier. What a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/13/12: My initial review (shown below) was pretty harsh on this product and a bit unfair as I had not used the product very long. After continued use I have found that although my nails do not feel thicker, they are holding together better than before. One nail completely splits down the middle which is why I wore acrylic nails for so many years. No polish or top coat or super glue would prevent this from happening. Ever snag a split nail?

Well done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----Original Review-------&lt;br /&gt;This product could hardly be worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite applying per instructions - it went on as nothing more than a kind of rubbery sort murky top coat. Not only did not my nails NOT feel thicker, the product itself proved to be extremely fragile. When working in the kitchen I was sorry that I hadn&#x27;t worn gloves because the product was marred and peeling when all was done.

    <li> Not only does this product NOT work, the company&#x27;s return policy is for 30 days only and if the product is unopened!  Does that make any sense?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;veknown this product for years and for those who don&#x27;t use the bright nail polish or like the &#x27;natural look&#x27;, but have weak and easily breakable nails, this is the &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product. The best part, it has no pharmaldehide in it.</li>
    <li> I use and love  the Barielle Nail Cream. So I thought I would try they&#x27;re Nail Thickener, after a couple of weeks using it I found my nails instead of getting thicker they became brittle and started chipping. This product might work for some but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Although it does make nails seem thicker, I have trouble with the polish chipping.</li>
    <li> My nails were brittle and peeling...when I keep this stuff on it actually allows my nails to grow. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, but I love the difference it&#x27;s made in my nails</li>
    <li> I found this product very good for protecting my nails, long lasting before it needed to be redone.  Very good service &amp; fast shipping plus a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using this product. It does make my nails much harder.</li>
    <li> I have had troubled nails for some time and have tried many products that claim to help.  This one is living up to what they claim.  My nails are thicker, stronger and growing!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn acrylics for over 15 years and they left me with lumpy thumb and index fingernails that were awful. I have been using this product for about 6 months and the lumps are almost completely gone! I will never stop using it. Several years ago I smashed my thumb in the safe at work and that nail has been splitting and cracking ever since. The nail thickener hasn&#x27;t fixed that problem yet, but I&#x27;m hoping it will take care of it, too.</li>
