      <li>I have really fair skin and burn really easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and hope to continue using it for many more!</li>
      <li>I used to use this when it was available in stores and loved it.</li>
      <li>Gives a nice healthy glow to the face and neck areas.</li>
      <li>Love the product but Amazon sent me one that was opened</li>
      <li>I Love Love Love</li>
      <li>That is how much I love this bronzer.    </li>
      <li>I love this bronzer.</li>
      <li>:) THANK YOU</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t want to tan and damage my skin, but I like to wear sundresses and this bronzer gives me the perfect sun-kissed look instantly.  </li>
      <li>soooo glad I was able to find this item,</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m Sure I Will Try It Now.</li>
      <li>that I wasn&#x27;t sure about.</li>
      <li>With Just A Lil Blush On Top</li>
      <li>Thanks for the 2 packs wonderful price and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It is really the best around, I really don&#x27;t know why drugstores have discontinued it.  </li>
      <li>I can create just enough color in the winter and add a beautiful glow in the summer.</li>
      <li>I have light skin for reference.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>I have always loved this product, I&#x27;ve bought the same stuff for years.</li>
      <li>Just as good as bare minerals bronzer, but SO much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered!</li>
      <li>The picture used is of the old formula, which was about 2 shades lighter and could easily be used as a highlighter on my light brown skin-</li>
      <li>I am mixed with Native American, French, Irish, and German, and have very fair skin with light eyes, and this shade works perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>That said, I am excited to wear this as a bronzer on my cheekbones, temples, and forehead for a very sunkissed look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been through several different package changes, and it&#x27;s still the same great product!</li>
      <li>I was really excited to see this product, due to the fact that it is no longer sold in most drugstores.</li>
      <li>People constantly commented on how beautiful my skin was with the old formula,as it was fine, but not thick and easily blended over the center of my face with a big powder brush; bringing any look together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just dip a large powder brush in bronzer, tap off the excess, and dust it on my collarbone, shoulders, cheeks, and forehead.  </li>
      <li>These have too much shimmer too.</li>
      <li>and it rubs off very soon after you apply it.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all...</li>
      <li>Use more for stronger shading or less for a sunkissed tan.</li>
      <li>I use Alot of high end makeup products, but always keep this on hand.</li>
      <li>It is actually a little more neutral, and I use it as blush.</li>
      <li>a good quality blush brush (I actually use a larger powder brush), and tap a very small amount of bronzer into the lid, swirl brush lightly in lid, then tap.  </li>
      <li>new formula is darker and thicker.</li>
      <li>So this will work and is worth the money, but I was simply expecting the old formula and color.</li>
      <li>So hard to find a loose bronzer that I love as much as this one!</li>
      <li>First of all, the color in the picture is not exactly the color of the product.  </li>
      <li>Although, I was a little suspicious of this one because it had a perfumey scent to it and any time I have bought this in the past, it has never had any kind of scent to it.</li>
      <li>The slightly red undertone to this gold shimmer reminds me of a cross between the old Gold N Glitz formula and the discountinued color Sunkissed.</li>

<li> Product Def Lasts A LONG Time!</li>
<li> I am sorry I wasted my money, and will be looking for a better product somewhere else.</li>
<li> basically the places that turn pink when you are sun-kissed.  </li>
<li> When Used With A Pink Eyeshadow,Like Revlon&#x27;s.</li>
<li> Not only does it not shimmer at all, but it is a dull brown color.  </li>
<li> so I started trying other brands and ugh!</li>
<li> I use it everyday.</li>
<li> the list goes on, but they all pale in comparison to this bronzer.      </li>
<li> It matches my skin when I&#x27;m tan or pale.</li>
<li> There is very little, if any \\&quot;glimmer\\&quot; to it</li>
<li> messy and hard to control</li>
<li> Apply in small sweeping circular motion to cheekbones, forehead, bridge of nose, and chin...</li>
<li> I also use it sometimes as a subtle eyeshadow, when i just want a little shimmer.</li>
<li> I am so sad I can not find this in the stores anymore!</li>
<li> I just received this product today and I am really disappointed with it.  </li>
<li> It is AWFUL!</li>

    <li> Perfect transaction and soooo glad I was able to find this item, thought it had been discontinued,over joyed to see it was still available and at a great price !!!!! I use it on top of my blush for healthy glow!!!</li>
    <li> It is really the best around, I really don&#x27;t know why drugstores have discontinued it.  Can&#x27;t find it anywhere, but on line.  Makes me furious when you&#x27;ve used a product for a log time........than all of sudden can&#x27;t find it!  If you like something you almost have to stock up on it, because when you run out, it can&#x27;t be found!</li>
    <li> I Love Love Love This Bronzer,It Is Kinda My Go To For My Morning Makeup Routine.I Like To Use It On My Cheeks  With Just A Lil Blush On Top And I Also Use It As An Eyeshadow(Great When Used With A Pink Eyeshadow,Like Revlon&#x27;s. Anyways Never Thought To Use It On The Shoulders But I&#x27;m Sure I Will Try It Now.Product Def Lasts A LONG Time!</li>
    <li> I just received this product today and I am really disappointed with it.  Not only does it not shimmer at all, but it is a dull brown color.  There is very little, if any \\&quot;glimmer\\&quot; to it and it rubs off very soon after you apply it.  I am sorry I wasted my money, and will be looking for a better product somewhere else.</li>
    <li> First of all, the color in the picture is not exactly the color of the product.  It is actually a little more neutral, and I use it as blush. I am mixed with Native American, French, Irish, and German, and have very fair skin with light eyes, and this shade works perfect for me.  My daughter has caramel-colored skin, and it also looks great on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a good quality blush brush (I actually use a larger powder brush), and tap a very small amount of bronzer into the lid, swirl brush lightly in lid, then tap.  Apply in small sweeping circular motion to cheekbones, forehead, bridge of nose, and chin... basically the places that turn pink when you are sun-kissed.  You don&#x27;t need much at all... in fact the last container I bought lasted a year.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product, I&#x27;ve bought the same stuff for years. Although, I was a little suspicious of this one because it had a perfumey scent to it and any time I have bought this in the past, it has never had any kind of scent to it. I have heard of counterfeit make up before and was worried that this might just be because of the scent. It did cover just the same and work just as well as the regular Bonne Bell shimmer bronzer that I have always purchased, but it was the strange scent that I had never smelled before that I wasn&#x27;t sure about. I would probably purchase again, just because this cannot be found in any stores in my town or towns nearby. Although, I wasn&#x27;t very pleased with the scent, it does fade, thankfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this product since 1998!  It&#x27;s been through several different package changes, and it&#x27;s still the same great product!</li>
    <li> Love it! Wish they sold it in the stores! Looks amazing with any skin tone! I LOVE this product! There is not another bronzer that compares to it.</li>
    <li> I have really fair skin and burn really easily.  I don&#x27;t want to tan and damage my skin, but I like to wear sundresses and this bronzer gives me the perfect sun-kissed look instantly.  I just dip a large powder brush in bronzer, tap off the excess, and dust it on my collarbone, shoulders, cheeks, and forehead.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and hope to continue using it for many more!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore, so I went in search of it online. Hopefully they don&#x27;t stop making it all together! Applies great! Just as good as bare minerals bronzer, but SO much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This happens to be my favorite bronzer, I can&#x27;t find it at any stores, thank you amazon!! This blends easy and looks great! I can create just enough color in the winter and add a beautiful glow in the summer. I&#x27;ve even been asked if I just got back from vacation. Ha.</li>
    <li> I dont mind spending money on something that I like, but with regard to bronzer, it just isnt necessary to spend a lot.  Bonne Bell Bronzer is the best on the market for me.  I have tried Chanel, Lancome, Dior... the list goes on, but they all pale in comparison to this bronzer.      Trust me!    I love the color.  It lasts all day.  Its perfect.  I find that it gives me a nice, glowing, natural color that blends perfect with my skin and my blush (I apply it all over my face, then use blush on my cheeks as well).  This color is not orangey, nor is it too rose, its the perfect sunkissed color.    I actually bought this in bulk because I had a scare when my drugstore decided to stop carrying it.  That is how much I love this bronzer.    Its a great product.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> messy and hard to control</li>
    <li> I am so sad I can not find this in the stores anymore! I even made trips to specialty makeup stores and they don&#x27;t have it either. It&#x27;s the perfect bronzer, it works with my skin tone regardless if it&#x27;s winter or summer with an awesome tan. I also use it sometimes as a subtle eyeshadow, when i just want a little shimmer. So glad I found it on good ol Amazon! Thanks for the 2 packs wonderful price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> So hard to find a loose bronzer that I love as much as this one! Couldn&#x27;t find this in any store s anymore so I started trying other brands and ugh! So happy I found this on Amazon :) THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer. It matches my skin when I&#x27;m tan or pale. It&#x27;s not orange one bit!! Use more for stronger shading or less for a sunkissed tan. I use Alot of high end makeup products, but always keep this on hand. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Love the product but Amazon sent me one that was opened</li>
    <li> Product that arrived was packaged different than the picture.  These have too much shimmer too.</li>
    <li> The product is 5 stars, but I am only giving it a 4 because this is not the same as the picture used to advertise it. I was really excited to see this product, due to the fact that it is no longer sold in most drugstores. The picture used is of the old formula, which was about 2 shades lighter and could easily be used as a highlighter on my light brown skin- it was a punched up version of my skin, in the same way pearl highlighters work on alabaster skin. People constantly commented on how beautiful my skin was with the old formula,as it was fine, but not thick and easily blended over the center of my face with a big powder brush; bringing any look together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new formula is darker and thicker. I am scared of putting this on my face, because it will probably need a lot of sheering out to work as a highlighter. I feel like this will make me darker. That said, I am excited to wear this as a bronzer on my cheekbones, temples, and forehead for a very sunkissed look. The slightly red undertone to this gold shimmer reminds me of a cross between the old Gold N Glitz formula and the discountinued color Sunkissed. So this will work and is worth the money, but I was simply expecting the old formula and color.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered! Very Pleased!!</li>
    <li> Gives a nice healthy glow to the face and neck areas.</li>
    <li> I used to use this when it was available in stores and loved it. I ordered off of amazon since I could no longer find it for sale anywhere local. It is AWFUL! Totally orange and gross. Will not purchase again. I have light skin for reference.</li>
    <li> Awesome luv this product</li>
