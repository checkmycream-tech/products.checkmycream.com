<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got this product much earlier than I had expected atleast 2 wks. before the expected delivery.  It was well packaged.  I got this for my husband for control of his blood sugar.  His blood sugar used to be around 140 to 160 for many many years in spite of taking insulin.  He has been using this tablet only for the past 2 weeks, and already his sugar has dropped down to around 100, which has never been the case ever.  We are planning to continue this and recommend this product to all of our friends.  This is a god sent medicine for him.</li>
    <li> I just started taking these, so this review is a bit premature but I ordered them to help stimulate my metabolism which is in the dumps. There should be extra followup reviews for vitamins and herbs because you can&#x27;t say they work until they get in your system.  I can say though that they are easy to swallow, no bad aftertaste and delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> My husband is a diabetic, the Dr.told him if you don&#x27;t start lowering your levels your going on insulin!!!!!!!!!! I was upset. so I searched on the web, and read the reviews and came across this wonderful product. It works wonderfully his levels have reduced drastically .I swear by it. You will too.</li>
    <li> Hard to provide real data. Sense that it does help so I will be looking forward to better trend on bloodwork...</li>
    <li> i purchase this for my uncle,&lt;br /&gt;he has diabetes, and according to him it really helps keep sugar levels.&lt;br /&gt;The Bitter Melon is remedy for diabetes, and since it tastes way too bitter,&lt;br /&gt;pills is good idea for those who don&#x27;t want to eat or drink juice of it.</li>
    <li> I have found that these help control my blood sugar (as part of doctor&#x27;s care of course). Recently lost 20 pounds, and was able to cut back to only this supplement, after taking Metformin for years. As I said, I am under doctors care, but my A1C levels have been good and this seems to have no side effects. I take at least one per day, and another at night if I am having a meal that includes desert. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, and also the caplets, but found the Himalaya capsules work best for me. This was confirmed by Indian friends (and my doctor) as being the most reliable source of bitter melon - which is sometimes called Karela.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fresh version has long been part of Chinese and Indian cooking for health, but they call it bitter melon for a reason!</li>
    <li> Wife has been feeling bad and did some research to add Bitter Gourd in her diet. She has been feeling better, more energy and better digestion! Good purchase, no complaints!</li>
    <li> I used this product for about two months, but then I saw a bad review on it. I have noticed that it does keep my diabetes in check, but the review online said it could cause liver problems. I stopped using the product and returned all of my unopened bottles cause I can&#x27;t afford a liver problem. I have since ordered Gumnema and will soon test this for my diabetes problem. I do want to mention that my A1C went from a 10 to a 7 in the two months I used the product, but my mind still travels back to the liver problem. I didn&#x27;t get any issues with my liver, but I don&#x27;t know how long before I would&#x27;ve taken the product before that issue had developed.</li>
    <li> This was for my mother, she usually eats bitter melon to help with her diabetes, but as she&#x27;s gotten older she has cut back on cooking so taking it in supplement form helps.</li>
    <li> best product to control type II</li>
    <li> The person i ordered them for has reported a great improvement with diabetes. His sugar level has reduce</li>
    <li> This did not work for me it actually made my sugar levels go up from 6.0 to 6.9</li>
    <li> I am Ayurvedic Practicioner and love Himalaya Herbs!</li>
    <li> Well, Karela is a good herbs.  It helps reduce the blood pressure and it works really good. Just a couple of days taken it start showing the results. Its amazing  and i will be purchasing it again soon. I will recommend it to some of my friends or anybody who wants a good results. Keep up the good work guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susie Que Maryland</li>
    <li> would love to know if this is vegan because cannot find that on the label and with my diet restrictions I need to know please</li>
    <li> I must say that since I&#x27;ve been taking Himalaya Bitter Melon, my sugar has been great.  You will definetly notice a difference in your blood sugar readings.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  I&#x27;m not on metformin or anything like that, trying to control my sugars with natural supplements and this is a very good one.  I recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Taking two capsule everyday since Nov 2013 till today 5/16/2014 and glucose level went from 108 to 128. Seems it did not work.</li>
    <li> Very strong! Do. Not drink this if you have no blood sugar issues!</li>
    <li> Products were  expired</li>
    <li> This comment has nothing to do with any particular herbal products. I am a Physician and this my general observation.People who take supplement are also very driven to get better and follow medical advice to the tee and some.Without double blind studies, it is hard to say what is effective.Established medical community feels that supplements are harmless as long as you do not abuse or exceed the recommended guidelines. Also, they feel that most of patients also do all the necessary things like, excercise, eat right, no tobacco,moderate alcohol etc. If ALL the pt do these, physicians will go bankrupt or will have to give up their Mercedes !!!</li>
