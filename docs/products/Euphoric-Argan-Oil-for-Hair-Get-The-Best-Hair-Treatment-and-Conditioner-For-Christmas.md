      <li>, she got shinny hair and they look healthy.</li>
      <li>MY HAIR FEELS SO HEALTHY AFTER USING THIS ARGAN OIL.AFTER</li>
      <li>LOVE IT  </li>
      <li>My hair is smooth and silky after just one application!  </li>
      <li>First of all I like the good smell.</li>
      <li>so far i&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>Could tell the difference after the very first use!</li>
      <li>They are silky smooth and shinny.</li>
      <li>This kept my hair frizz free and let it get wavy from the damp air.</li>
      <li>I Shampoo HaS Restored The Life Back Into MY Hair Great Product For The Price</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product and really works!</li>
      <li>Great product for dry, curly hair.</li>
      <li>This Argan oil is easy to be absorbed.</li>
      <li>It came right on time through Amazon Prime and was just as advertised!</li>
      <li>Really good if you have really long hair and want to get rid of the frizz.</li>
      <li>Smell light, absorb fast.</li>
      <li>not as good as other products</li>
      <li>SENDING RIGHT AWAY</li>
      <li>Then I thought, that’s right</li>
      <li>I am a white chick with a lot of very fine hair that will frizz.</li>
      <li>Love this product, smells great and a little goes a long way with this</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
      <li>AND RECEIVING WITH NO DAMAGE IS A FIRST STEP TO ME</li>
      <li>I tried quite many dandruff products and whatever shampoos and conditioners from local stores.</li>
      <li>I love this product and would definitely recommend to everyone!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>Only oil I will ever use on my hair again :)</li>
      <li>in my book this does not meet the definition of pure.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this hair treatment to anyone that wants healthier looking, shinier hair with no frizz!</li>
      <li>and I cannot believe just how much it has improved my hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very curly and frizzy.</li>
      <li>Nothing could solve my problem really.</li>
      <li>and I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>I order my first bottle of Euphoric Professional Argan Oil.</li>
      <li>And, the best part about this product is that fact that it is extremely high quality with no parabens, no sulfates, no mineral oil, and no alcohol, so it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like other products have in the past.</li>
      <li>and I always tell people I use Euphoric Professional Argan Oil Hair Treatment!</li>
      <li>Only one small pump needed to be effective and I can tell the difference immediately.</li>
      <li>Although it does make your hair feel soft.</li>
      <li>If this is a professional product, think twice before having a hair treatment at a salon.</li>
      <li>Really like it and will likely buy again.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s packed to the brim with silicones, which is not necessarily a bad thing, unless of course the company is selling this as \\&quot;pure argan oil,\\&quot; even though they allude to some other ingredients in the second half of the sentence.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE VERY DRY SPLIT HAIR, I HAVE TRIED SOOO MANY PRODUCTS IN THE PAST, I CAME ACROSS THIS ONE  </li>
      <li>Argan oil is the fourth ingredient out of 10, and even that isn&#x27;t 100% clear, since \\&quot;spinosa\\&quot; is only half a name, and used alone can mean many different plants.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hair was frizzy from a recent perm and was breaking off. My hair is also color treated. I have been using this oil for several weeks after my shampoo. It has worked wonderfully well and my hair is much softer and more manageable! It came right on time through Amazon Prime and was just as advertised!</li>
    <li> I thought it would make my hair greasy but my hair feels amazing. I love this product and would definitely recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I have fine hair and I really like this stuff. Only one small pump needed to be effective and I can tell the difference immediately. Great smell.  I will keep bugging it.</li>
    <li> This Argan Oil leaves my hair looking healthy and beautiful! A little goes a long way. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> My hair is 32 inches long and THICK. It&#x27;s also very curly and frizzy. The Argan Oil really helps the condition of my hair, and it looks great! It has a very nice scent. I&#x27;ve tried millions of hair products (seems like) but this is one I plan to keep in my regimen for good!</li>
    <li> Item is Made in China and not specified in product description. Item contains chemicals known as allergenic and/or harmful - dimethicone, keratin, tocopheryl, cyclopentasiloxane. Benzoate perfume. If this is a professional product, think twice before having a hair treatment at a salon.</li>
    <li> the reviews I read before buying this product  made it sound wonderful but its not doing much for my hair plus the smell I dont like</li>
    <li> I am not impressed with the Argan Oil. Although it does make your hair feel soft. It has somewhat of a sunflower oil smell, that I do not like.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product and really works! Could tell the difference after the very first use! I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo39LZZK4OXC4ZT]]I just love this product! It works so good and I cannot believe just how much it has improved my hair. I use to have hair that was dull with no shine. I also always found myself with frizzy hair that was not silky either. But, as soon as I started using this product, my hair has improved immensely. Now, my hair is extremely silky with no frizz! I get compliments on my shiny hair all the time now and I always tell people I use Euphoric Professional Argan Oil Hair Treatment! And, the best part about this product is that fact that it is extremely high quality with no parabens, no sulfates, no mineral oil, and no alcohol, so it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like other products have in the past. I would highly recommend this hair treatment to anyone that wants healthier looking, shinier hair with no frizz!</li>
    <li> Love this oil.... Only oil I will ever use on my hair again :) there&#x27;s nothing else like it out</li>
    <li> My hair is smooth and silky after just one application!  Love this product, smells great and a little goes a long way with this</li>
    <li> SENDING RIGHT AWAY AND RECEIVING WITH NO DAMAGE IS A FIRST STEP TO ME&lt;br /&gt;POSSITIVE STEP&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NOT TRIED YET CAUSE I WILL DO IT TOMORROW&lt;br /&gt;SO I WILL LET YOU KNOW THE RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;CAN T WAIT&lt;br /&gt;SEND ME THE FORM AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;TKS</li>
    <li> It is the best product but I need more information (tips and recommendations). I need a brochure the company (other products).&lt;br /&gt;Deniz Rivas Plata (Stylist)</li>
    <li> so far i&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome! A little expensive tough.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3FAQ893A5HH2V]]Seriously the best argan oil hair treatment I&#x27;ve tried.  It makes my hair shiny and beautiful and it even smells lovely! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Best argan oil I&#x27;ve tried. Really good if you have really long hair and want to get rid of the frizz. This is not pure argan oil, it has a bunch of synthetic friends added to it but it works. It worked for as long as I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> After I moved to America from HK, my scalp and hair were gone so dry to the point that dandruff fallen like snowflakes, itchy … sign. I tried quite many dandruff products and whatever shampoos and conditioners from local stores. Nothing could solve my problem really. Then my friend told me to try Argan Oil hair treatment, which works well for her hair. Then I thought, that’s right, she got shinny hair and they look healthy. I order my first bottle of Euphoric Professional Argan Oil. First of all I like the good smell. I don’t like pungent smell on or around myself. Here is the how I use it. I use it to massage my scalp after shampooing, and wash off after 10 minutes. Yes I replaced my conditioner with it. Then I apply a pump, work from hair tips to the roots. After a week using it, I felt my hair is so moisturized and nourished. They are silky smooth and shinny. This Argan oil is easy to be absorbed. Amazingly, scalp is not itchy and dandruff problem is greatly improved. I love this awesome product, and absolutely highly recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it does make hair look good, though I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  It&#x27;s packed to the brim with silicones, which is not necessarily a bad thing, unless of course the company is selling this as \\&quot;pure argan oil,\\&quot; even though they allude to some other ingredients in the second half of the sentence.

Here is the list of ingredients missing in the company description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;cyclopentasil oxane&lt;br /&gt;dimethiconol argania&lt;br /&gt;spinosa kernel oil&lt;br /&gt;c12-15 alkyl benzoate&lt;br /&gt;parfum&lt;br /&gt;sweet almond oil&lt;br /&gt;linum ussitassimum (linseed) seed oil&lt;br /&gt;olea Europaea oil&lt;br /&gt;tocopheryl acetate&lt;br /&gt;Cl 26100&lt;br /&gt;Cl 47000&lt;br /&gt;hydrolized keratin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry, but in my book this does not meet the definition of pure.</li>
    <li> I used this product for an entire week in punta cana, dominican republic. I am a white chick with a lot of very fine hair that will frizz. This kept my hair frizz free and let it get wavy from the damp air. Really like it and will likely buy again. Price is fair.</li>
    <li> I HAVE VERY DRY SPLIT HAIR, I HAVE TRIED SOOO MANY PRODUCTS IN THE PAST, I CAME ACROSS THIS ONE  TRIED AND ILOVE, LOVE IT  IT IS AMAZING. MY HAIR FEELS SO HEALTHY AFTER USING THIS ARGAN OIL.AFTER A MONTH OF USING THIS AFTER EVERY SHAMPOO I WILL USE NOTHING ELSE TRY IT ITS AMAZING .</li>
    <li> Great Product My Hair Is Coarse And Brittle But Using This Each Time I Shampoo HaS Restored The Life Back Into MY Hair Great Product For The Price</li>
    <li> not as good as other products</li>
    <li> Smell light, absorb fast. It is weird but the head was all wet with the leaking oil, even the new package was not broken.</li>
    <li> Premium oil that I love the most!</li>
    <li> Great product for dry, curly hair.</li>
