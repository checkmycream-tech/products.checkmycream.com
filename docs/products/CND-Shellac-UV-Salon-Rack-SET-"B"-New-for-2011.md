      <li>My mom is a nail tech, and she was amazed that CND&#x27;s quality is better than OPI&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>, looks awesome alone on short nails, or with silver vip over it.  </li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>once you start you are going to wont more....</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love Shellac.</li>
      <li>Most nail salons want a better selection of colors, which aren&#x27;t all that fabulous.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also wish that they had better colors.</li>
      <li>Have fun and go for it!!</li>
      <li>Sometimes the \\&quot;more expensive\\&quot; option has FREE shipping and costs you less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s really easy to apply (just like nail polish).</li>
      <li>So convenient (and a huge savings at the end of the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>kit is great in that you get to a solid start-up.</li>
      <li>-nice bright pink for summer</li>
      <li>Thanks a bunch!!!</li>
      <li>I have tried different brands of gel polish and none of them are as good as Schellac.  </li>
      <li>is a cool environment).</li>
      <li>it has is true</li>
      <li>and I spent a fraction of the price; with what I spend at the salon in 2 visits I paid for this and can use it MANY more times!  </li>
      <li>i think its worth every penny its as easy as it saids first</li>
      <li>Thanks for the quick service!</li>
      <li>There is a nice set of necessary objects including an instructional DVD to get started with Shellac.</li>
      <li>the end of the day, fun set.</li>
      <li>If you wanted all these colors, or if you were a nail salon just starting out, it would be okay.</li>
      <li>You can pick it up super cheap at your local drug store, or probably on Amazon, but thought I would put that out there to get you started if you have shellac on</li>
      <li>It is absolutely TRUE that Shellac is BY FAR easier to remove, and it held up just as well.</li>
      <li>the clear goes out quick.</li>
      <li>last is top coat then wipe last coat with alcahol that easy so far iv&#x27;e done my nails twice and iv&#x27;e also done my neice and sisters</li>
      <li>Like some, not so much others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The new layering colors like moonlight and roses or zillionaire would also dress it up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Only down side is that CND does not have as many colors as OPI&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>in low light it looks very vampy dark &amp; out in the sun its brighter and lighter&lt;</li>
      <li>the removal pads DO NOT include acetone to remove the old shellac.</li>
      <li>the kit is for a professional in that it has materials and display stuff.</li>
      <li>Thanks again until next time!</li>
      <li>Coral - light shimmery color with a lot of gold...if you drag it very lightly over black pool, you will get a shamrock green effect</li>
      <li>the colors are very diverse (and as it says, it doesn&#x27;t inlude all of those shown), which is good and bad.</li>

<li> The ordinary consumer will not need or want this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> get me wrong.</li>
<li> and I am obsessed with Shellac!!</li>

    <li> There is a nice set of necessary objects including an instructional DVD to get started with Shellac. The number of colors is sufficient but certainly limited.</li>
    <li> fue muy facil todo el tramite el producto llego antes de lo que esperaba y en excelente estado, ademas de que estoy facinada con el producto.</li>
    <li> Dears, I have been waiting for the product, I was so happy when the package was arriving to test the colours on my nails.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described and on time!  This is the same product salons use and I spent a fraction of the price; with what I spend at the salon in 2 visits I paid for this and can use it MANY more times!  Thanks a bunch!!!</li>
    <li> Loved this product!  My nails have not split for the 6 weeks I have used this polish.  This is the longest my nails have ever been!</li>
    <li> This was a great set with great presentation.  The only minor complaint I have is that some of the colors never get chosen, so I run out of others before the rest.  But that&#x27;s a client thing, not a shellac thing.  :)  The product itself is absolutely wonderful!</li>
    <li> Really great purchase and totally worth the money.  I&#x27;ve already tried out three colors and I am obsessed with Shellac!! This is a great starter kit and saves you money specially if you like the colors that come with it.</li>
    <li> I finaly got my shellac product it&#x27;s awesome everything that the product saids it has is true i got my base coat top coat and 6 colors i think its worth every penny its as easy as it saids first its the base coat put under uv light 10 sec then color coat dry 2 min each coat last is top coat then wipe last coat with alcahol that easy so far iv&#x27;e done my nails twice and iv&#x27;e also done my neice and sisters nails super awsome great deal and you can always buy more colors!!</li>
    <li> So easy to use.  I love this stuff.  Now I can do my nails at my own convenience and they look like they&#x27;ve been done in a salon.</li>
    <li> My mom is a nail tech, and she was amazed that CND&#x27;s quality is better than OPI&#x27;s. The process to getting beautiful nails is quicker and simpler than OPI&#x27;s version. The nail polish does stay on for a couple of weeks as described. However, I&#x27;m always doing something with my hands, and the polish at the cuticle seems to lift and out of habit I pick and peel off. So the polish never makes to see week #2. This is perfect for special occasions where you need your polish on your a while before you have time to change color. Only down side is that CND does not have as many colors as OPI&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a great way to save money. In the nail shops they charge an extra 15-20 buck which is nail rape.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can do it myself. I don&#x27;t like that it comes in such small ounces and the clear goes out quick. I also wish that they had better colors.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit. I just started using Shellac at home. I am a fan. So convenient (and a huge savings at the end of the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is great in that you get to a solid start-up. BUT be advised:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the removal pads DO NOT include acetone to remove the old shellac. You can pick it up super cheap at your local drug store, or probably on Amazon, but thought I would put that out there to get you started if you have shellac on now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) the kit is for a professional in that it has materials and display stuff. The ordinary consumer will not need or want this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) the colors are very diverse (and as it says, it doesn&#x27;t inlude all of those shown), which is good and bad. Like some, not so much others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to get an array. That said, I probably could have ordered things individually and like EVERYTHING I got, and probably even spent less money. But I have no regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: go on CND Shellac&#x27;s website and \\&quot;meet the colors.\\&quot; The display is clearer on their site, imo, and gives truer indication of color. Then you can go on Amazon and find that color and buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP 2: check around on Amazon. Sometimes the \\&quot;more expensive\\&quot; option has FREE shipping and costs you less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, fun set. Have fun and go for it!! I started with Axxium nails. It is absolutely TRUE that Shellac is BY FAR easier to remove, and it held up just as well. So I would suggest the Shellac vs. OPI. Also, it&#x27;s really easy to apply (just like nail polish).</li>
    <li> I iked the convenience of having the top and base coats as well as four colors in one purchase. Saloon shellac manicures I had used CND products with good success, I&#x27;ve had the same results.  Application easiest when polishes are room temperature (where I store them is a cool environment).</li>
    <li> Perfect set for gel polish users.  I have been using Schellac for 2 years at home doing my own nails. I have tried different brands of gel polish and none of them are as good as Schellac.  other cheaper brands never last longer then a couple of days without chipping. Schellac is the best gel nail polish.  All my friends are always amazed that I do my own home manicures and Schellac polish.</li>
    <li> I used Shellac nail color at home, so I bought this. If you wanted all these colors, or if you were a nail salon just starting out, it would be okay. The black rack is not really useful. Most nail salons want a better selection of colors, which aren&#x27;t all that fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I love Shellac. But I would recommend just picking the colors that you like and forgetting the rest. I have never used the rack and will probably end up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> Great product! Thanks for the quick service! Would highly recommend this product!Keep up the great service! Thanks again until next time!</li>
    <li> These are UV cured &#x27;gel&#x27; polish. Done properly, a CND Shellac will last 1-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have softer flexible nails - My nails need polish to keep from breaking and get longer. Acrylic kills my nails and if a salon does a generic &#x27;off brand&#x27; gel polish, they often file my nails making them really damaged and weak so I decided to buy the CND kit &amp; do it myself (also saving me $ in the long run.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly Pink - pink toned clear - i use as a base before using cream puff for french mani smile line then Negligee over the top&lt;br /&gt;Iced Coral - light shimmery color with a lot of gold...if you drag it very lightly over black pool, you will get a shamrock green effect&lt;br /&gt;Gotcha -nice bright pink for summer&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood - the best best best red ever - think Marilyn Monroe lips... with a shimmer that&#x27;s not really a frost or a glitter&lt;br /&gt;Masquerade -deep wine frost.  in low light it looks very vampy dark &amp; out in the sun its brighter and lighter&lt;br /&gt;Black Pool - opaque black black, looks awesome alone on short nails, or with silver vip over it.  The new layering colors like moonlight and roses or zillionaire would also dress it up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ the base and top coat (needed to perform the mani correctly.)</li>
    <li> Instead of the rack set I received a starter kit. The starter kit only comes with four shellac colors, and none of the colors I did want were in the kit. No display, no signage, just stuff I didn&#x27;t want. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> great set to get you going, but once you start you are going to wont more.... I get my nails done all the time with shellac, and they last two weeks.  I use my hands for work (bookkeeping).  but wear gloves at home for house cleaning.</li>
