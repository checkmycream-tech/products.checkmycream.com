<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have had this dryer for almost 2 years.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Today, a flame shot out from it and nearly caught my hair on fire.  It was like a torch.  This is so hazardous!</li>
    <li> Have had this blow dryer for about two months now and it has been great.  Bought this base on the reviews and haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great.  It is so light weight!  I am very pleased with it.  Best hair dryer I have owned.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It works great, and it is lightweight. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by this hair dryer! I am not willing to spend $50 or more on a fancy hair dryer, so I hoped this one would be close enough. It works great - better than expected! Dries fast and gets plenty hot. It comes with several attachments which fit securely and don&#x27;t fall off. Also love the miles-long cord so I can stand anywhere in the bathroom while drying my hair!</li>
    <li> Its a really great dryer. It smooths my hair as it dries. My hair looks and feels like I just left the salon every time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it! Its light weight and it doesn&#x27;t blow out an extreme amount of heat to your hair. Its very professional, something like would experience at a salon. The only thing that is kind of bad is if you just barely accidently touch the cold air button, the blue button, the cold air comes on. But, I found a way to work around it, holding it in a way that I don&#x27;t hit that button. But I love that Its so light weight and the way it leaves my hair so soft and silky I wouldn&#x27;t settle for anything else. My dog also loves it, its the best part of bath time for her :)</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon warehouse deals, so it was a few dollars cheaper. The only thing it didn&#x27;t have was a box. Everything else was there, and working. There was no damage to the item itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer runs a bit quieter and smoother than my previous one, and has both the concentrator and diffuser, and cold shot, so I&#x27;m set. It&#x27;s light too, so if you spend a lot of time using it your wrist and hand won&#x27;t get as tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy for the price. Better than the $30 one I bought at Sally Beauty.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer, hasn&#x27;t damaged my colored treated hair. The attachments are great and the time to blow my hair out doesn&#x27;t take long. I&#x27;m very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my review awhile back. Last night I was blow drying my hair on high and the dryer turned into my very own sparkler. I don&#x27;t have thick or long hair so it wasn&#x27;t like I had it at that speed for long. If you want a hair dryer that last shy from year, get this dryer. Getting a new dryer today and it&#x27;s not going to be this one again. Had cheaper ones which last then this one. Gave it 2 stars because it was a good dryer. But it is a risk to purchase.</li>
    <li> Had it for a couple of weeks and cooked, almost causing my house to go up in flames.&lt;br /&gt;Made in China?</li>
    <li> I would not buy this hair dryer again.  I have had it for exactly 1 year and it performed ok until today. It is 5 days past the warranty period and it just broke. Sparks started coming out of the back of the unit and my entire bathroom smelled like it was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;I do not wash my hair daily. This product was used 2-3 times a week. I also regularly cleaned the back filter of any dust or debris, so I am pretty disappointed I only got 12 months out of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even before it stopped working I was not all that impressed with it. It dried my shoulder length fine hair in marginally shorter time than a regular dryer and I did not really notice a difference in added shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be placing an order for this cheap Revlon RV544PKF 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, which I purchased to replace my MIL&#x27;s ancient one last year. This Revlon hair dryer I AM really impressed with. Super light weight and dries hair in record time.</li>
    <li> Loved this hair dryer when I first received it...now it makes all types of noise and smells....filter is clean so I have no idea what the problem is.  Dryer is totally sealed so can&#x27;t even open it to see what the problem is....</li>
    <li> My favorite thing about this blow dryer is the the long cord it has.  This is also lightweight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Im a hairstylist. I have 2 of these. Super light and dries great. Not loud either!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this works perfectly.</li>
    <li> It was sparking. Fantastic. And it was lighter then air, it was a peice of crap. Do. Not. Buy. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I really liked this dryer when I first got it. It was powerful and my hair always looks smooth and shiney after a blow out (I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz). About a year after purchase (and when the warrenty expired) it began making an extremely loud buzzing sound. Also, the temperature does not stay consistently hot. The temperature will be hot for a few seconds, then go cool and then go back to hot for a few seconds (while on the hottest setting). I am no longer happy with this only a year later and I have bought a Babyliss brand dryer due to the high rating on amazon.</li>
    <li> Seller was fine and prompt and would purchase from again.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself had an amazing rating and was claimed to be one of the top ones.&lt;br /&gt;Claims to eliminate static and frizz and is no different than any other hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Bought this hairdryer about a year ago. When I was using it the other morning, it went on and off and went on fire. Needless to say, I am not recommending it.  Never had this happen with any hairdryer I&#x27;ve owned.  No stars doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option, so it gets one by default.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is really a professional hair drier, but the tourmaline Ionic technology doesn&#x27;t harm my hair or make it brittle in the dry climate. Love the  9-foot length cord especially when traveling and I need to get to a mirror that isn&#x27;t close to the outlet.</li>
    <li> You can choose hot, warm, or cold air in high or low airflow. The long cord allows you to move freely.</li>
    <li> Not as hot and powerful as I expected and somehow it does not deliver any kind of expected shining usually produced by professional ceramic dryers...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly not one to write reviews but do rely heavily on them and this item was rated very high by Amazon customers who purchased it.  I have to admit, I really, really liked it until it just simply stopped working.  It is lightweight and powerful and fairly quiet for a blow dryer.  I was real happy with it until it just recently stopped working...conveniently right outside the 1 year limited warranty.  I didn&#x27;t misuse or drop it and I kept the filter clean so not sure what happened but I know my last blow dryer lasted for years.  It was working when I gave it away when I got this one.  So, not so thrilled but maybe it was a fluke.  Who knows.</li>
    <li> I am a 60-something female and as you can imagine have owned my share of hairdryers over the years but I have to tell you that this is the best and a real bargain at the price!  I am ordering more for gifts.  It is very lightweight and the fastest dryer I have ever owned. My only regret is that I did not find this one years ago.  You will not be disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is without a doubt the best I have ever purchased. It is light, easy to handle, and leaves my hair soft and silky. Will dry hair very quickly, eliminating flyaways and frizz. Great tool for the price.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVED this hairdryer so much that she bought another when the first one sparked and died after several months.  Unfortunately, several months later, that one sparked and died.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> its as good as the original T3 and for such an incredible price</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. I was slightly skeptical because some of the reviews were quite negative. But trust me, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. The dryer arrived quickly in the mail and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! The dryer is lightweight and dries my thick, waist length hair super quick. It comes with a diffuser, an extra filter, and a concentrator (which I use daily). The buttons/functions are simple yet adequate and there&#x27;s also a light that turns on when the dryer is on. I think it&#x27;s a little unnecessary for the light but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. There&#x27;s also a cold shot button which I use at the end of blow drying my hair to seal the cuticle. The cord is quite long, and since my outlet is pretty high up and I don&#x27;t need to stand too far from the plug, it can get tangled. It also becomes tedious to have to coil the cord around the dryer so many times for storage because it doesn&#x27;t come with a Velcro strap to keep the cord tidy. But these things are minor. I definitely still love this dryer and would recommend it to those looking for a relatively inexpensive dryer. This purchase was big for me considering all my other dryers were $15 and under but just weren&#x27;t cutting it. I also love that the dryer came in white. So chic!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this dryer! It dried my thick, heavy hair so fast! Also, the cord was fantastically long! Would be 5 stars, but I bought it last April, and sadly it has already died on me. There seems to be a short in the cord. If I wiggle the cord around at the base of the dryer, I can still get it to work a little. Tempted to buy another, since the price is so reasonable.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer for the price!</li>
    <li> I am not a fashionista.  My hair is short...Just need a lightweight hair dryer that does not damage my thick, course hair.  This dryer meets those criteria. it is as light as my old travel sized sunbeam and does a fine job of drying.</li>
    <li> Love it! Just did not get any papers to register/warrantee on this product.</li>
    <li> I first reviewed this product in a magazine and once I got it, I understood why it was rated so high. This is the best blow dryer I have over owned and especially for the price, it would be hard to beat!</li>
    <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t blow the fuse, priced really well, received it quickly from the shipper. I definitely recommend this hair dryer. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> So fast and lightweight I love it even my hairdressing blow dryer was slower than this one .. I am glad it blew up ! Love love love this product</li>
    <li> Works well.  Just what I wanted at a good price.  The different attachments make this hair dryer especially useful. Adjustable controls are also good.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing hair dryer it dries my hair quick bought it because it was top rated and happy I did. I would never want another.. and if this ever goes I will buy another one!</li>
    <li> Not necessary to buy something that costs a fortune. With this hair dryer you get it all. It dries my hair very fast and without damage. It even comes with a removable filter for cleaning with one extra. And the electric cord doesn&#x27;t tangle. I&#x27;ve had other blow dryers with retractable cords .. seems like a good idea, until the mechanism breaks.I&#x27;m glad I took a chance, as I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product a negative I would.  Bought my first one with a gift card and loved at it at first, it great power and heat.  It lasted about 6 months before it started cutting out. I contacted the seller, but I was beyond what they would cover.  Then I contacted the distributor who said &amp;#34;no problem, send back the defective product and we will replace it.&amp;#34;  Neat, sent it back at my cost :(.  Receive the replacement pretty quickly, yay!  Sadly about 6 months later I had the same issue with the new one cutting out, no power.  Not sure it is worth contacting the distributor again so I can pay to send it back for a new replacement that might last another 6 month. DONE.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair dryer that was cheaper, but made well. This has fit the bill. I&#x27;m a guy and decided I could manage my hair a few ways with a hairdryer, if I chose. I didn&#x27;t want to burn my hair out or have something too feminine or fancy sitting in my bathroom closet. This is simple and sleek. It sounds like a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> you cant beet this dryer at any price.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for the girl going off to college</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  I was using cheap ones before and wondered why my hair was frizzy.  No more frizziness with this dryer.  I should have got it years ago. It is also lightweight.  Only wish the cord was shorter.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer in mid Jan 2013.  It had all the power of my beloved previous hair dryer, weighed much less and cost less as well.  It is now mid October 2013, a mere 10 months later,  and starting my brand new job, I went to dry my hair after my shower and it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I reset the dryer. I reset the outlet.  I tested my curling iron on the same outlet and it turned on.  I tested the hair dryer on a different outlet in another room and it still wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I was a very light user since I had it.  I never left it out or even left it plugged in.  I always put away after each use.  The dust catch on the back end was still not even dusty.  Just dead for no reason.  Will be exploring the 12-month limited warranty on the manual, but don&#x27;t know what compensation that will yield.  Will have to go back to Conair Pro Ceramic since it always served me very well without fail.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer. It&#x27;s very powerful, and the attachments all fit nicely. The cord is a little longer than I&#x27;d prefer, but overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in March 2014 to replace a similar model from Sharper Image, that I had to give up after almost 8 years. It was burned out.  Other reviews said this hair dryer was identical to the Sharper Image model , it is now January 2015 and in less than a year it has stopped working!! When I am drying my hair it just shuts off. If I shake it, it comes back on for a minute or two and shuts off again. I do not have long hair and use it for about 7 minutes a day for the past 10 months. It is of course no longer eligible for a return..... I would not recommend this dryer and will not be purchasing it to replace the current one. It is a shame because I LOVED it up until today.</li>
    <li> Has 2 heat setting with also a cold blast button. It dries my long think hair quicker than any other dryer I have tried. Comes with all the accessories you could need!</li>
    <li> This lightweight hair dryer was highly recommended by Good HouseKeeping Magazine.  In fact when I ordered it I had to wait almost 2 months to receive it.  IT was on back order.  Well it arrived and at first it seemed great, very light and easy to use.  But then my hair started to look flat and dry and a bit frizzy  So I stopped using it and went back to my old hair dryer and my hair is now full and bouncy again.  Can I return this item?</li>
    <li> Overall the power and cord length in this blow dryer works very well.  My only complaint is the temperature of the warm setting.  With very fine hair it is important for me to use as little heat as possible on my hair to avoid damage.  The warm setting is hotter than my old one, and I&#x27;ve never even used the hot setting!</li>
    <li> I liked this hair dryer well enough until sparks started shooting out where the cord is attached! I only use this dryer 3x a week and it didn&#x27;t even last 8 MONTHS! That&#x27;s ridiculous. I loved the length of the cord and that it had attachments. I smelled burning and sparks started shooting from my dryer, I throw it on the floor and quickly unplugged it. When I picked it up, the entire unit was very hot to the touch and the cord had completely severed one of the wires. That was not like that before I started. Is it too much to ask for a safe hair dryer?</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and did not know how this would stack up compared to more expensive brands I have used, but given the price, thought, it is worth a try, have not invested a lot of money in it. The watt is 1875, which is better than most dryers and the cord is long enough to maneuver around clients in the chair. This dryer hands down is the best investment I have made. It has a great design, dries hair fast with multiple heat settings and cool shot. A Great buy and GREAT product! Thanks</li>
    <li> Lightweight and lots of hot air, but nothing too special about it tho. One thing I don&#x27;t like about this hair dryer is that it is a bit loud.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer itself is light weight and easy to handle.  It also dries faster than the average hair dryer.  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great Product for the price. Very light  and powerful. You don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money for a good hair dryer. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer in September 2012.  We are now in November 2013 and it blew up.  Power was ok but it did dry my hair fairly quickly.  I love the light weight; easy to handle. After a year it became very loud.  I continued to use it and a week later it started smoking while the noise got louder.  It&#x27;s safe to say I will not be using it anymore.  I am disappointed since this product received great reviews.  However, they are from people who just bought the product so they don&#x27;t know about the longevity or lack there of.</li>
    <li> I was excited about the hair dryer and used it less than two weeks and the high speed just quit. High speed is what I use to dry my hair so now the dryer is useless to me. I have never had this happen. I purchased the hair dryer because it came highly rated.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!  Purchased this model after seeing the Good Housekeeping reviews.  Lightweight, the right amount of power to style my hair just right, nice extra features like the cool shot button and the extra long, flexible cord, and all at a reasonable price.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading about it in a magazine.  I love it.  It drys my hair very quickly and without frizz!</li>
    <li> Works really well and is very lightweight. It is a little louder than I&#x27;m use to and that&#x27;s why I docked a star.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a very nice hair dryer. It is lightweight, which is a big plus in my book. I gave only 4 stars for 2 issues: 1) noise, and 2) cold-shot button. This is not the noisiest hair dryer I&#x27;ve used, but I do wish it was a bit quieter. Not enough of an issue to make me sorry I bought it. I do really wish, however, that the cold-shot button could be set so you don&#x27;t have to continually hold it down. My previous hair dryer allowed the button to be set and left, which I liked a lot as I use it frequently. Luckily, the overall lightness of the dryer allows me to hold the button down fairly comfortably.</li>
    <li> Best dryer I have ever owned.  I love it.  It took a bit to get it but it was well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Extremely long cord which can be a pain but dryer is very good. Light weight. Reasonable price. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist. This dryer fit me like a glove. LOVE it. Concentrator attachment is nice and wide, and the dryer is really quiet, not heavy at ALL. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very nice and works really well. Even though this is not expensive, I expect this will last my wife a long time.</li>
    <li> I really like this blow dryer, I purchased it to replace a conair product that died. The dryer is a decent weight, the cord is extra long making it easy to move around. The on/off switch sometimes is turned off during blow drying bc of the location. Generally a good dryer, fairly quiet.</li>
    <li> Smooth, shiny results. I have been looking for a low price quality dryer and so far this is the ONE!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does seem to dry my thick hair faster than my old dryer.  They both are 1875 w.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer dries my hair fast.  This has to be the fastest hair dryer out there.  My hair is VERY thick and it has always taken me about an hour to get it completely dry....but not with this one!  It is a great price and a great product!</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer. Has a cold setting which is very important if you don&#x27;t want to burn your hair. It&#x27;s light also.</li>
    <li> Love it. Recieved it quickly. Dries really fast. Only down side is that it vibrates leaving my hand tingly. But its awesome.</li>
    <li> Only used for few months and already quit working.</li>
    <li> This s the best blow dryer that I have ever used!!! Dries hair quickly and leaves a beautiful shine. Also very nice long cord which makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> Not worth spending twice or three times this for a name brand.&lt;br /&gt;Works well, just a tad noisy. If you need a basic dryer this is just fine.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after less than a year.</li>
    <li> Stopped working and almost burned my hair from sparking at the base of the cord. AFTER ONLY 4 MONTHS!</li>
    <li> I have used this dryer for a couple months now and its been great. I was skeptical when I got it since it was so light, but it has a powerful motor and dries my hair in a fraction of the time my old, heavy dryer did.  The light weight is a big positive because of an old injury to my elbow. I can actually dry my hair without creating pain in my elbow.  The long cord is great too.  I am very happy with this dryer and highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Going on 6 months of use and I still love it. The lightweight design is a lifesaver since I have managed to re-injure my elbow &amp; wrist. My husband has noticed that it is not as noisy or annoying as other hairdryers. The filter is easy to clean and I have cleaned it several times to keep the motor from overheating.  I still highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer. I use it on warm/high. It still takes a while to get my hair dry. Still, with dryer, it is much smoother than with my last con-air.</li>
    <li> wife loves this hair dryer,it is light weight and works very well. It was rated # 1. Its very well worth buying.</li>
    <li> I have no words for how my hair turned out with this dryer. A little background: I have medium length, very thick and curly hair that is generally a frizzy mess. I would blow dry with a Vidal Sassoon travel-size dyer and then flat-iron with my ghd (which I held in Holy Grail status until a couple months ago). Afterwards, it would okay for an hour and then turn into an unmanageable, tangled mess. And then along came this Pro Beauty Tools hair dyer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was very shiny, bouncy, with a slight wave at the bottom (but that&#x27;s how I like it). I literally couldn&#x27;t believe what a difference a better blow dyer could make .I didn&#x27;t even need to iron it afterwards! Had I known this before, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent 200 dlls on the ghd. Oh well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare it to many other dyers since I&#x27;ve only owned one before, but I can honestly say that my experience with this one has been absolutely wonderful. If it ever breaks, I am buying another one. I&#x27;m thinking of getting the curling iron, too. The box said it compares to the tourmaline T3, only for a fraction of the price. If the T3 is any better, then it must have been crafted by God himself.</li>
    <li> STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONLY 7 MONTHS :(</li>
    <li> I choose the product based on price and brand. The hairdryer has also a diffuser tip for curly hair that works just fine. It has different speed and temperature options</li>
    <li> So far, this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the real Pro with affordable price...it dry fast with impressive speed....Love it</li>
    <li> This is not a compact travel hair dryer, but for home use it&#x27;s sleek, lightweight, and powerful. It has all the features anyone would need, and it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does not get hot enough for my long hair.....takes forever to dry. I am a hair stylist and probably should have gone for a professional brand. It would probably be good for the summertime and short hair styles.</li>
    <li> I bought this in September 2013 and loved it. I used it regularly for the last year. Recently, it started to short out and even SPARK when I used it. The place where the cable attaches to the handle is broken and the electric cord is exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happy to return the product for it to be refurbished, but Amazon LLC is no longer distributing them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer almost two years, I use it for about half an hour 5 times a week, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  The cord is nice and long, and the dryer isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.  Purchased the same model August 2013.  It only lasted a year and a month before it started making a weird noise.  Ordered another one anyway.  The problem with my new one is the straightening attachment won&#x27;t fit.  I&#x27;m using it without it.  Seems to work out okay.</li>
    <li> I have had many blow dryers......... then of course I needed another one, so&lt;br /&gt;instead of going to Target again, I thought let me see whats out there.... I love Amazon so&lt;br /&gt;that was the first place I went to. I saw this blow dryer and read the reviews and thought, let me give this&lt;br /&gt;a  try (because of the revew) and I just LOVE, LOVE this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was highly rated by Good Housekeeping as best lightweight dryer.  It is lightweight and easy to handle.  Dries fast, even on Low Heat. The fan on-off switch has the Off position in the middle of the rocker... wish it were the Down position. A bit confusing when you are not looking.  Also, this would be a fantastic product if the very, very long cord were a retract.  The long cord is a real asset.. no doubt about it and it doesn&#x27;t tangle. I would certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> It is light weight, but powerful, good quality for the price.glad i made the purchase. Handle is a little hard to hold, but over all, good</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my wife who happens to be a professional hair stylist, and I would say that she is very selective (picky) about the products she uses. For her work, similar hair dryers sell for almost $200. Consequently, I thought this was a very good buy. At any rate, so far she loves this product. She uses it at home and has nothing but compliments about the dryer. She even suggested that we should buy one for each of our two daughters for Christmas. So far, a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I will update this review if the dryer dies.  My goal was to find a reasonably priced, ion/ceramic/light weight dryer.  I had to return a porcelain one that was guaranteed to last because it was too heavy.  This works well and is light-weight.  I will update this review if the dryer dies within the next two years.  I do not want appliances than end up in a dumpster.  This dryer appeared to have a low number of one-star reviews, but they all have a few low reviews - regardless of price.  I&#x27;m glad I chose this one so far.</li>
    <li> I can not say enough good things about this hair dryer. I have long curly hair that took over an hour to dry. Now I can actually leave for work on time. My previous dryer was more expensive and not even close to being as good or as fast. No reason to ever spend more money again. I am a very satified customer. Without a doubt, I will be a repeat customer next time I need a new hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great price, lightweight, long cord which makes drying my hair and shifting the dryer from hand to hand so much easier, not as noisy as my last hair dryer, and it does dry my thick medium length hair faster than my past hair dryers. I am able to switch from warm to hot and high, off, low without having to look at the dryer.  I really do love this hair dryer!!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this hair dryer, so I am glad I ordered it.  It is lightweight and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer!!! light weight, no over heating, fast results!!! My only complain is that I wish it will have a retractable cord.</li>
    <li> Really good blow dryer, easy to handle and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hand down. I&#x27;m not really good at blow drying so having a dryer thats easy to handle is really important</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought on for my gf for the holidays and she loved it. I&#x27;m planning on buying one for myself</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair dryer. It produces very warm air with tremendous air flow. I will say it took 2 months for it to finally come from the time I originally ordered it.</li>
    <li> My hair is basically wash and wear. I swim 6 days a week and wash my hair after every swim.  This dryer drys my haie in about 90 seconds. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Yep, It works great and I have no trouble recommending it to anyone with hair!  Even for your dog and if you give your cat a seditive, it will work him too!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is exactly what I was looking for! It&#x27;s not outrageously priced, simple, lightweight, and dries hair fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for a little under a month but I absolutely love it!  It&#x27;s easy to handle, has two levels for the heat controls, and has a cold button.  It came with two attachments.  Great buy for the price!</li>
    <li> This little hairdryer is very light, easy to use, with 2 attachments. The controls are easy to use, and there&#x27;s a button for cooler air so that you can actually set your hair using hot then cold air. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this one yet - but when I need a new one, this will be it because Good Housekeeping just did a big review of hair dryers and this one was voted \\&quot;Best Value\\&quot;.  Here&#x27;s the link to an article about it: [...]</li>
    <li> I love love this hair dryer.  It is the best hair dryer I have ever had and the price was not not bad either.</li>
    <li> I would never buy this hair dryer again.  It had the shortest life of any I have ever owned.  Purchased 2 ct: Mine died within 4-5 months, and my daughter&#x27;s died within 9 mos. (She uses one less often).  We mostly air dry our hair, so it didn&#x27;t get the daily use that most people demand from a hair dryer.  An almost total waste of money.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Temperature is good, very nice design, but of questionable quality. In two months it stopped working, was repaired, and soon after again does not work. I use very little, I mean it&#x27;s not a matter overload, definitely not recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer after my Sharper Image was dropped after years of service.&lt;br /&gt;The Pro was well-rated by Good Housekeeping, that seemed to bode well. However, after using it 3 times I must say that it is an annoying tool. I use a round brush, and the slightest movement turns the hairdryer off or onto another setting - happens 4-5 times each time despite trying to get used to it.  The switch is not designed well.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a high speed and a low speed, but the desirable middle speed is missing.&lt;br /&gt;The weight is good, seems very light, and the price is good.  The hairdryer does leave my hair smooth, but I would advise you to keep looking, and not settle for the Pro.</li>
    <li> I have three teenage daughters so recently I purchased three different hair dryers from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I realized two were essentially identical except for the price, the length of the cord and the \\&quot;brand\\&quot; name. The Pro Beauty Tools 5885 Professional Lightweight Hair Dryer is the exact same as the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black by Revlon. Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options.  Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842). The major difference is the Pro Beauty Tools hair dryer does have a cord that is 2&#x27; longer than the Revlon dryer and it (the Pro Beauty Tools) has an extra filter included. For the $10 difference in price (Pro Beauty Tools higher) one can decide if these options are worth the extra cash. In my opinion both of these items are a FIVE STAR item for price and performance.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it...</li>
    <li> The dryer is featherweight, fast and very reliable; for the price I paid, this thing is a steal. Recommended 100%!</li>
    <li> i received it broken today.  have to send back to hopefully get a new, working, one.  very disappointed since it&#x27;s rated so highly.</li>
    <li> This dryer is truly lightweight and powerful.  Blow outs take no time. Comes with tools for spot drying and a difuser.  My hair comes out full and with lots of shine.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is the way to get a professional quality hair dryer at a fraction of the cost.  There are three or four brands selling essentially the same dryer including this one but none have the cord length of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its performance is exactly as hoped and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is incredibly long, making plug concerns a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We bought our second one recently.</li>
    <li> I chose this dryer based on product description and customer reviews.  It performs well and is lightweight.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The dryer worked as expected. Buttons placed well, nice long cord (just awkward to fold when putting the unit away).</li>
    <li> And I mean that in a good way.  It&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s powerful, and the 9&#x27; cord really lets you get some clearance from the vanity.  It&#x27;s pretty quiet too, and comes with a spare air filter element.  That, coupled with the ease of getting to it may help prevent what caused its predecessor&#x27;s demise - clogged with I don&#x27;t know what; dust, lint?? - that hair dryer became starved for air to cool its motor which caused it to burn up.  I suspect that&#x27;s what happens to most hair dryers, so choose one that&#x27;s easier to maintain.  This is one of those.</li>
    <li> Bought this hairdryer based on great reviews and so far it&#x27;s been great. Lightweight and comes with a couple attachments for extra shine or curly hair. Get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
    <li> I blow my hair dry every day so I buy a new hairdryer about once a year. This hairdryer is very light, blows very strong, and leaves my hair feeling soft. It&#x27;s priced great too. I can&#x27;t get a decent hairdryer for under $35 where I live. It also came with an extra air filter. I&#x27;m interested to see how long it lasts. Either way I would purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> Does everything the manufacturer states and the price was well worth it.  Shipping was quick and product was in good condition.  Would recommend this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t dry my hair with this often (air-dry, mostly) but when I do this picks up the pace and does the job for longer. thick hair.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is quiet and light and dries my hair very quickly.  It has cut my drying time in half.  I love the long cord, too.    Update as of 2/26/15: This has been a great blow dryer for just over two years.  This morning it died though.  I was using it and it seemed like the cord was coming unplugged as the power seemed to be waning and then ramping up.  I checked the cord and it was securely in the socket.  This lasted for about 10 seconds and then sparks shot out about 6 inches from the handle and it died.  I threw the dryer down and yanked the cord out of the wall.  WTF?  That was crazy.  I never expected to have sparks fly at my face this morning.  So, it was a great dryer until it almost blew up in my hand.  I still give it three stars as it was great for two years.</li>
    <li> GREAT hairdryer it is so light and works so well.  This is my second one the first one quit working because I wrapped the cord around the dryer and broke the wires at the end that goes into the dryer.  My own fault and I am being very careful not to make the same mistake again.  Lost without it while I waited to get the replacement. Great settings for low and high heat and slow and fast speeds plus the cool button. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair dryer. I am now on my third dryer and the same thing happened to this one the cord broke just past the reinforced cord portion. I will continue to purchase this hair dryer because of all of the other features because it is so light weight and the heat and drying speed controls. Just wish the cord would stop breaking.  I was care not to twist it around the dryer this time but it still broke.</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time. .....Lightweight.....powerful</li>
    <li> Even though I paid more for this dryer than others I&#x27;ve owned, it died suddenly after just 10 months even though I only used it 2-3 times/week. When it did work, the long cord got terribly tangled and was a pain, so be sure you want that if you buy this. But my advice is to buy a different brand. I&#x27;ve bought many brands of hair dryers over the years and never had one die after less than 2 years use! Theoretically this was still under warranty, but it didn&#x27;t seem worth the hassle to replace it (esp as I didn&#x27;t want another one) so I chalked it up to experience and bought a Conair for less $.</li>
    <li> I like the weight and size. I do not like the power, I would like more power. The price was great.</li>
    <li> It works fast, quietly and better than much higher priced hair dryers. I love the shine it leaves with minimal effort and time.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for Christmas.  It&#x27;s awesome.  I am picky about hair dryers and this one  dries my hair faster than the professional 1800W dryer I was using.  It has a nice long cord also.</li>
    <li> not as strong as i would like it to be</li>
    <li> After 3 months, this dryer stopped working effectively - it now makes a horrible noise and will not dry my hair.  I advise that you spend the money and buy a better product.  I&#x27;m not happy - however, it can no longer be returned...</li>
    <li> I really expected it to dry my hair super fast after reading the reviews, but I would say it takes just as long as a normal hair dryer. I like it, and it works good just not as fast as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> This is a a wonderful dryer, and it didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. Why didn&#x27;t I buy it earlier?</li>
    <li> It does dry the hair fast, but it really damaged my hair. It would get my hair so dry and fuzzy. I tried it twice, nad then gave it to someone else. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about the diffuser, which is what I bought it for.  I have wavy hair and this doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair - it leaves it looking limp and seems like it takes longer to dry my hair than my old hair dryer.  It is lightweight.  Maybe it works better for straightening?</li>
</ol>
