      <li>And the toner isn&#x27;t as refreshing to the skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s available in most of their stores.</li>
      <li>and I can tell it isn&#x27;t  quite as strong.</li>

      <li>Huge improvement in skin.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Two more weeks to be exact.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried AcneFree in the past and was not as impressed as I am with this.</li>
      <li>Breakouts are gone, skin is smooth, and what really surprises me, my skin isn&#x27;t oily anymore!!</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s so sweet...</li>
      <li>only took three or four uses until my skin was finally free!!</li>
      <li>So I was spending 30-40 dollars a month for something that wasn&#x27;t making my skin clear or feel better.</li>
      <li>so I needed another alternative because I love my clear skin.</li>
      <li>right after it hits your skin</li>
      <li>right now</li>
      <li>Equate has a much better price tag and the products works better and faster than Pro active!</li>
      <li>My skin has never been so smooth and in just one day it cleared my skin right up and took the pimples I had almost completely away.</li>
      <li>We both saw results within the first week.</li>
      <li>Purchased for teenage grand son who was having some break-out issues.  </li>
      <li>I tried it several times to make sure and it never failed</li>
      <li>/&gt;**The cleanser does not lather well so use more than a pea size if necessary.</li>
      <li>This step 1, 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) wash is not made as fine as the more expensive brands, so it may be more abrasive.</li>
      <li>Certain things work for certain people</li>
      <li>i really recommend it</li>
      <li>Still having breakouts, just not as much.  </li>
      <li>that said, it&#x27;s working well so far, and the price is right.</li>
      <li>We both love it and like other reviewers have said, It&#x27;s just like the &amp;#34;real stuff&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Maybe even created a more oily environment cause for the first time since high school, ten years ago, I have breakouts and my Proactiv can&#x27;t get here soon enough.</li>
      <li>Said it is working even better than Pro active!</li>
      <li>Decent Proactive replacement.</li>
      <li>(24 with mild to moderate acne)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to mild to moderate acne sufferers.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if you used proactive to give this product a try.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>Same ingredients as proactiv (and Acnefree, but with a different dosage) totally worth it, but don&#x27;t pay the prices amazon sellers ask, it&#x27;s $11 at walmart!!</li>
      <li>my skin is completely clear!</li>
      <li>This stuff is exactly the same at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>Proactive, which I first started using in 2002 and always came back to using Proactive&#x27;s cleanser/toner until now.</li>
      <li>and I bought this because of the price difference and because my skin was already clear and just wanted something to maintain that for cheaper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very nicely surprised</li>
      <li>I decided to consult with a dermatologist and get professional acne care plan.</li>
      <li>I am still in the trial processes with this product but so far it is my staple</li>
      <li>I am hoping the Equate Acne System and the BC Pills do the trick to control the acne completely.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and myself</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 25 year old African &amp; Native American woman &amp; my acne gets real tricky on me.</li>
      <li>Had 15-20 new white heads a day,</li>
      <li>Brought my moderate acne down to mild acne.  </li>
      <li>I am 40 years old and a Female.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Proactiv for years and loved it other than it was so expensive.  </li>
      <li>Not to mention with the &amp;#34;auto-ship&amp;#34; you always end up with too much or too little of something.</li>

<li> Just like Proactive, It takes a little time to clear up acne.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m trying to find a product that has the same ingredients, but minus the microbeads.  </li>
<li> I was curious one day if there were any companies out there that made a generic version of Proactiv when I found this product.  </li>

<li> That thought never crossed my mind to try because I never had to leave it on that long with pro active.</li>
<li> Both boxes had been opened and were taped closed.</li>
<li> It seems that they could leave out the microbeads, and just let us use a rough washcloth to scrub instead.  </li>
<li> and it is a extremely finer feel.</li>
<li> Some say other products will work just as well if you use them twice a day, as you are supposed to this, but it&#x27;s never been the case for me.</li>
<li> If it&#x27;s not one, it&#x27;s the other.</li>
<li> ,  it has made my face smoother than any other product,  trust me</li>
<li> I have tried both, Equate and Pro active...</li>
<li> If I see no results then I&#x27;ll just have to suck it up &amp; pay for pro active because</li>
<li> For 12 bucks at Walmart, the price is right, but I was skeptical, since other products have dried out my skin or made my breakouts worse.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
<li> I hate paying the higher price but this cheaper product price doesn&#x27;t compare to having a clear complexion.</li>
<li> My face used to be really dry after washing and moisturizing, then about halfway through the day it was like an oil slick.</li>
<li> Works just as well for half the price.  </li>
<li> I will never go back to the expensive name brand as long as I can keep buying it for so much less.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and did not have any weird reactions to the equate products.  </li>
<li> week: skin is no longer dried out by this product however my skin is not as oily either.</li>
<li> this product dried out my oily skin ( which was a plus for me)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Not impressed. I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for over ten years and I bought this because of the price difference and because my skin was already clear and just wanted something to maintain that for cheaper. The face wash is comparable because its grainy and can be scrubbed into the skin the same as the proactiv wash. The toner is the same color but nothing like the toner, and to make things odd- right after it hits your skin it makes you smell like fish oil. I tried it several times to make sure and it never failed so I had to stop using it. The moisturizer didn&#x27;t do anything but prevent your skin from drying out. Didn&#x27;t prevent breakouts at all. Maybe even created a more oily environment cause for the first time since high school, ten years ago, I have breakouts and my Proactiv can&#x27;t get here soon enough. I hate paying the higher price but this cheaper product price doesn&#x27;t compare to having a clear complexion.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Works just as well as Proactiv.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> Saw a difference, will keep using</li>
    <li> Save money compared to Proactive.  Works just as well for a fraction of their price.</li>
    <li> Works great will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and myself (I&#x27;m 35)  We both love it and like other reviewers have said, It&#x27;s just like the &amp;#34;real stuff&amp;#34; Proactive, which I first started using in 2002 and always came back to using Proactive&#x27;s cleanser/toner until now. I will never go back to the expensive name brand as long as I can keep buying it for so much less. I&#x27;m very nicely surprised and we have been using it once/day for about 4-5 weeks now. We both saw results within the first week. Just like Proactive, It takes a little time to clear up acne.</li>
    <li> I bought mine at walmart last night. I used proactive for years. This stuff is exactly the same at a fraction of the cost. I used it last night and have already noticed redness and blotchyness from acne going fown. Proactive dod the same for me when i used it but its just too expensive for me now. I highly recommend if you used proactive to give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as well as Proactiv, but I was disappointed to see that it contains plastic microbeads just like Proactiv, as well.  They&#x27;re poisoning our lakes and oceans, and I can&#x27;t in good conscience keep using products that contain them http://www.5gyres.org/microbeads  It seems that they could leave out the microbeads, and just let us use a rough washcloth to scrub instead.  I&#x27;m trying to find a product that has the same ingredients, but minus the microbeads.  Please reply to this review if you know of one!</li>
    <li> It has worked great for me. Iv only been using it for two weeks. Just as good as the  original proactive system.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Proactiv</li>
    <li> I was so desperate to save my skin and after doing research i was very lucky to stumble across this product. My acne was slowly fading after just one week and after another week (2weeks time) my skin is completely clear! It feels so good to be able to do the things I need to do during the day as before I would avoid going anywhere I didn&#x27;t have to. Bottom line it works! (24 with mild to moderate acne)</li>
    <li> This seems to be helping my acne.  I have been using this system twice a day, per the instructions, for about a month.  Brought my moderate acne down to mild acne.  Still having breakouts, just not as much.  I am 40 years old and a Female.  I will be going back on Ortho-Tricyclen Birth Control Pills soon, as that has always helped my acne.  I am hoping the Equate Acne System and the BC Pills do the trick to control the acne completely.  I have sensitive skin and did not have any weird reactions to the equate products.  And you can get the Equate Acne System at Walmart for about $13.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> Great item! Great price!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I was considering Proactiv because I keep breaking out around my lower cheeks/jaw and mouth. Or, as my mother said may &amp;#34;beard and mustache&amp;#34;. She&#x27;s so sweet... I got it off the shelf at Wal-Mart for $11.97 and it&#x27;s available in most of their stores. I love it. My skin has never been so smooth and in just one day it cleared my skin right up and took the pimples I had almost completely away. Some say other products will work just as well if you use them twice a day, as you are supposed to this, but it&#x27;s never been the case for me. I have also suffered from oily/dry skin. If it&#x27;s not one, it&#x27;s the other. My face used to be really dry after washing and moisturizing, then about halfway through the day it was like an oil slick. Not anymore!</li>
    <li> Buy this from Wal-Mart it&#x27;s about 11 or 12 bucks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same ingredients as proactive so I bought it for my wife. Her acne starred clearing up in 3 days after a week it was big difference.</li>
    <li> Awaresome product for cheap! I happen to used the product for three days within a week instant results. Facial bumps or blemishes started fading away.</li>
    <li> My son really liked this. Said it is working even better than Pro active!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 years now after using proactiv for about 3 years before that. This product is significantly less expensive and in my opinion is better than proactiv. After using proactiv for 3 years it stopped working for me. So I was spending 30-40 dollars a month for something that wasn&#x27;t making my skin clear or feel better. Not to mention with the &amp;#34;auto-ship&amp;#34; you always end up with too much or too little of something. This product can be purchased on Amazon, and there is also a similar product that can be found at bed bath and beyond. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I like this product..i have used it for only 5 days and I can c d difference,  it has made my face smoother than any other product,  trust me v tried them all but this works wonders... it&#x27;s not a miracle worker but I can feel the difference n I Can tell it&#x27;s gonna work wonders... i really recommend it</li>
    <li> Have no idea.  Purchased for teenage grand son who was having some break-out issues.  He said it seemed to help.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a wk now &amp; still no changes. I use it twice a day, once when I wake up &amp; once before I go to sleep. I&#x27;m a proactive user &amp; it works for me but it&#x27;s to expensive for me right now so I needed another alternative because I love my clear skin. I&#x27;m trying this because if all the good reviews but I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s only been a week so I&#x27;ll give it some more time. Two more weeks to be exact. If I see no results then I&#x27;ll just have to suck it up &amp; pay for pro active because at least I know it works for me. I&#x27;m a 25 year old African &amp; Native American woman &amp; my acne gets real tricky on me. I&#x27;ve read in one if the reviews that the lady left the cleanser on for 2 mins so I&#x27;ll try that method. That thought never crossed my mind to try because I never had to leave it on that long with pro active. Certain things work for certain people so we shall see who&#x27;s the victor in the end if these 2 weeks. I&#x27;ll post another review when my decisions been made.</li>
    <li> Works just as well for half the price.  I have been using Proactiv for years and loved it other than it was so expensive.  I was curious one day if there were any companies out there that made a generic version of Proactiv when I found this product.  I decided to order this one and give it a try and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  I will never buy Proactiv again when this is equal in quality and effectiveness and saves me money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on 4-3-13 from my local Walmart for $12 bucks. Since then I have been using this product twice a day. In 3 weeks it has help clear up cystic acne and heat like bumps that my dermatologist has been trying to clear for months!&lt;br /&gt;1st week: I was very doubtful. this product dried out my oily skin ( which was a plus for me) but I seen no change in my acne.&lt;br /&gt;2nd week: read reviews on Walmart and learned to leave the cleanser on longer than two minutes. By the end of the week I noticed acne going away and skin smoothing out.&lt;br /&gt;* sulfur mask does help to dry acne out. I used it 3x in week 2 alone.&lt;br /&gt;3rd week: skin is no longer dried out by this product however my skin is not as oily either. Huge improvement in skin. 90% of acne is gone! Face looks brighter and healthy and not damaged and irritated like it was with prescription topicals.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to mild to moderate acne sufferers. I am still in the trial processes with this product but so far it is my staple product.&lt;br /&gt;**The cleanser does not lather well so use more than a pea size if necessary. You can always by the items in this system seperately .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started to have acne breakouts in my 30s. I never had this problem to this extent in my younger years. So I decided to try this. Initially it worked well, but obviously my acne is hormonal so then it stopped working. I decided to consult with a dermatologist and get professional acne care plan. I&#x27;m going through that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to consult with the pros. This step 1, 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) wash is not made as fine as the more expensive brands, so it may be more abrasive. I&#x27;m now on 5% BP and it is a extremely finer feel.</li>
    <li> Same ingredients as proactiv (and Acnefree, but with a different dosage) totally worth it, but don&#x27;t pay the prices amazon sellers ask, it&#x27;s $11 at walmart!!</li>
    <li> Decent Proactive replacement. I&#x27;ve used Proactive for over 10 years. The cleanser does not have the same soothing exfoliating crystals as found in the Proactive solution. And the toner isn&#x27;t as refreshing to the skin. And the Step 3 thing seems the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, it&#x27;s working well so far, and the price is right. That&#x27;s the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and save a couple hundred bucks a year with this solution. I&#x27;ve tried AcneFree in the past and was not as impressed as I am with this.</li>
    <li> I have tried both, Equate and Pro active...Equate has a much better price tag and the products works better and faster than Pro active!</li>
    <li> Ive been looking for a three-step product that Costs less than Proactive, and this is perfect! works even better! Works better than Acnefree also.. only took three or four uses until my skin was finally free!! Don&#x27;t pay what these guys ask, because you can go to your local Walmart and pick up a box for $11!</li>
    <li> I have used Proactiv for the past 10 years, but now that I&#x27;m on a tight budget, I needed to find something very similar to Proactiv and much less expensive. I read reviews online about Equate Acne Treatment, and decided to give it a try. For 12 bucks at Walmart, the price is right, but I was skeptical, since other products have dried out my skin or made my breakouts worse.&lt;br /&gt;Its been a week since using the system and I am amazed at how fast and effective it is!!!! Breakouts are gone, skin is smooth, and what really surprises me, my skin isn&#x27;t oily anymore!! I hope Walmart never discontinues this line of skincare. Goodbye, Proactiv!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I switched from proactiv and I can tell it isn&#x27;t  quite as strong. But my skin is still looking good.</li>
    <li> One of the two boxes was  ripped apart on the side and the bottles inside were not attached and loose.  One of the bottles leaked.  It was sold as &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;.  Both boxes had been opened and were taped closed.</li>
    <li> This was a great &amp;#34;Treatment System&amp;#34;.  Had 15-20 new white heads a day, started using this nightly and it cleared up in about 2-3 weeks, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Love  this it dose what it says</li>
