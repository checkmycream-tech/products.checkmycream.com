<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The Pure Sir Toiletry bag is THE perfect dopp kit, to the traveler, gym bag, or overnighter you keep in your trunk. I had been looking in depth online to replace my old canvas dopp kit of similar design, now discolored and the leather strap had torn off. My needs were very specific and it wasn’t until I came across the Pure Sir bag, that I didn’t need to look any further. It is perfect, because I wouldn’t change a thing. First, the Pure Sir bag is elegant at  first sight, soft leather-like look and  feel to the touch, yet sturdy construction that is durable, and received in a quality box, you could  purchase as a gift. The waterproof inside lining is a nice added touch. The lightweight is essential to any traveler watching every pound, and don’t want to lose an extra pound towards the weight of a toiletry bag.  The design, is what I was looking for, two separate zippered compartments are essential, one for liquid items, the other for dry items, so when the shampoo spills, it’s not all over your floss and toothbrush and cotton swabs. The third exterior compartment is an added bonus for quick access items that are flat, and can pack quite a bit in there. The size is perfect, and if you don’t use all the space it provides, it compacts for better fit in your luggage than some other toiletry bags. I think this is the first dopp kitt that would easily clean really well, without losing shape, color, or quality due to its material, real leather could not stand up to the test of time as the Pure Sir. The materials used are quality to the branded zippered tabs, there’s nothing cheap about this dopp kit but the purchase price. There are dopp kits 3x the price that truly don’t compare. Additionally, the customer service is superb and love that it has a 30 day money back guarantee, because it doesn’t need one. I look forward to more products by Pure Sir in the future.</li>
    <li> I thought the bag looked great in the pictures so I ordered 2 of them. When they arrived I was more than pleasantly surprised with the quality, looks and functionality of my new purchases, especially for the price. The classy gift box that it comes in, makes gift giving that much easier.</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast delivery. I really enjoy the extra effort put into the whole package.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get a chance to review this toiletry bag. My Son goes to a lot of custom truck shows as part of his membership in a truck club. I gave it to him and asked him to give it a try and tell me about it.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I did look it over before giving it to him. I checked the craftsmanship. How well is this sewn? How strong is the zipper? How much will it hold? I was very thorough and didn&#x27;t find a single thing that I didn&#x27;t like about the bag. I was very impressed by all I saw. To me, it was of really good, solid craftsmanship. The stitching was strong and consistent. The zippers were heavy duty. The material was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I sent it with my Son for the &#x27;use&#x27; test. The bag held all his essentials with more room left. It held up to being packed away, tossed around and a long weekend of use.&lt;br /&gt;He is a man of few words but he really liked this bag. He&#x27;s still using it and loves that it actually provides a bit of protection for his belongs, as well as, holding them.&lt;br /&gt;We both agree that it&#x27;s a bag worth having and that it&#x27;d make a wonderful gift for all the men in your life.</li>
    <li> I needed a new men&#x27;s toiletry bag for upcoming holiday travels. I had been carrying an old, stiff and heavy leather one with a single central compartment that made it difficult to find small items that would always seem to be at the very bottom. This new Pure Sir toiletry bag solves both these problems -- first, it&#x27;s lightweight and pliable so it will flex more easily and also compress to take less room in my bag. Secondly, with two spacious compartments it&#x27;s far easier to keep my toiletries organized and accessible. There&#x27;s also a third compartment on the outer side that&#x27;s great for flatter items like pill packets, bandages and other forms of protection. I forgot to mention the zippers on my old bag were always getting caught on the edge of the fabric, and the leather &amp;#34;pull tab&amp;#34; had long since broken off. This Pure Sir toiletry bag&#x27;s zippers are all smooth pulling and have sturdy metal pulls that won&#x27;t give out in my lifetime. All in all a great little bag for all my toiletry items.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bag for my husband &amp; he loves it!  Great quality product!</li>
    <li> What a fabulous, high-end toiletry bag this is.  I purchased one for my husband and one for my son for an upcoming trip.  They love it and I am also impressed with the looks and quality of this bag.  I will now have to purchase more for my other son and sons-in-law.  It is waterproof on the inside which is a big plus!  Even the packaging is beautiful.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you purchase this bag.  A++++++++ and fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> Toiletry Bag was delivered quickly and to my surprise holds all my products with room to spare! I travel often and this bag has become a mainstay for me. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bag! It made a great Fathers Day gift, exactly what he wanted.</li>
    <li> Great product, packaging, value, AND customer service!  Would buy again as a gift!</li>
    <li> Minor flaw with the stiching</li>
    <li> It is a nice bag and the idea of two compartments to keep potentially leaking liquids away from other items seems like a good idea.  However, I do find it harder to find items I&#x27;m looking for in this bag compared to my previous bag that had one large compartment.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for valentines day. He travels quite a bit and was sick of seeing his stuff in a ziploc bag. I have to say this is wonderful! He loves it. The size is great. Material is high quality. Also waterproof material is a plus. The box it came in was so nice. Customer service is amazing and overall shipping was very quick. totally recommend this men will love it foe practicality and quality.</li>
    <li> Great product! Exactly as it appears and it can hold plenty. The three different pockets definitely help separate the items into use frequency. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> When I received the men&#x27;s toiletry bag, I was impressed with the packaging that it came in. I knew this was going to be very nice and it was. The toiletry bag has three compartments in total. It has two larger compartments and a smaller compartment on the side. The bottom of the toiletry bag expands to give you more room in the inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each compartment has a zippered close, and a nice zipper accessory. The toiletry bag feels soft. It is made out of a soft leather. It also comes with a handle making it easier to carry. Each of the compartments are separated by a material that feels soft as silk. This toiletry bag is well designed. I know that my husband will enjoy using this bag because if he doesn&#x27;t I have a few good uses for it.</li>
    <li> My husband was very surprised with this bag.  Finally one that is big enough, yet is soft sided, so it can be crammed into a small space.&lt;br /&gt;Two separate compartments are nice.  I wish it looked more like leather.  Priced very well, so would buy it again.  Will see how the zippers hold up.</li>
    <li> Very nice, simple, straightforward bag.  Zippers appear to be quality and the large metal tabs are attractive and functional.  Construction seems solid with good stitching.  Overall, just what I was looking for and at the right price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly how it is stated online. Better quality than I expected. Very nice kit for anyone.</li>
    <li> Looks like a great Dopp. There&#x27;s a small imperfection in the material (small cut). Upon hearing about the tiny defect, the company was kind enough to ship me another bag ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding customer service + great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this bag - so many great reviewed got my hopes up very high.. and that may be why.  I really cannot believe this retailed at any point for $100.  I think if the price was $20 I would have just kept it, but for $39.99 I had to send it back.  I do not think it is leather, not sure what the material is... and it is very basic... 2 compartments... a front zipper pouch, thats it.  For the money, think you can do much better.</li>
    <li> Great size and I like the waterproof factot</li>
    <li> I bought this bag for my husband and he is very happy with it.  I am very impressed with the quality and would seek out this brand again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. Once it arrived I was pleased to see the different compartments. He has different items that needed to be separated and this bag was just what he needed!!!</li>
    <li> Great bag and great customer support and follow up!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  He travels quite a bit and really loved the bag.  He was impressed with the quality&lt;br /&gt;of the bag, the size of it, and all the zipper compartments.  He is a very picky guy and I was relieved that he liked the bag!  I would&lt;br /&gt;purchase this item again when the need arises.</li>
    <li> Nice bag, worth the $.</li>
    <li> Great bag...soft and flexible</li>
    <li> Husband loves the divided sections that other bags don&#x27;t have. Searched and searched for this product to replace his old one. Very happy</li>
    <li> Very nice leather, just what I wanted. Delivered on time. I particularly liked the two compartments. Keeps thing from getting too cluttered.</li>
    <li> I was replacing a lost Thule kit. And was hoping this would be similar. I liked that it had 2 separate zipper areas, and was waterproof. I was disappointed in the material it was made of. It felt very cheap. I am hoping that once my husband fills it that it will work out.</li>
    <li> The price and quality of this bag are both outstanding. It has lots of space inside with two split main compartments plus one on the side. The style is clean with no overwhelming logo on the side. The materials inside and out seem like they will last a long time with an appropriate level of care. Great product.</li>
    <li> It was a Father&#x27;s Day gift. My husband liked it and I was very pleased with the appearance and packaging of the bag. The reviews I read were accurate. It was a 5 star transaction.</li>
    <li> Not as heavy as material as my old one but holds all my stuff, probably won&#x27;t last much more than a year, then I&#x27;ll order a leather one.</li>
    <li> I had a Dopp toiletry bag for over 37 years and it just plain got worn out from use so I looked for a suitable replacement. I did a complete and exhaustive search and found the Pure Sir bag on Amazon that I thought would best suit my needs. The low price was excellent compared against its peers and the bag&#x27;s construction was superior with the large zippers and the two different sized compartments. Plus the small zippered pouch for tiny items. I even like the feel of the material although it is not leather like my last one. In short, I am very happy with my purchase and believe I got the best deal possible. On top of all that the bag came in a matter of days exactly as was promised in my order and it was well packaged against any possible shipping damages. I highly recommend this bag to other male consumers in search of a great toiletry kit travel bag. My only suggestion for possible improvement would be to add the color brown to your offerings.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband. He loves it and I love it! It&#x27;s a Great quality bag!</li>
    <li> This bag was a great choice, the different compartments make everything organized, nice quality also.</li>
    <li> Great customer service. Quality bag. Everything I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Excellent bag, plenty of room for electric shaver, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, nasal spray, brush, deodorant, etc..  Multiple compartments allow you to keep items that may leak separate from dry items.  Quality is top notch.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a decent sized toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the military so he does a lot of travel all the time. This bag has two compartments and is very roomy without the bulk. Its very well made and the zippers are very nice. The color is basic black and the material is durable abd waterproof. I would recommend this bag for men on the go all the time, My husband loves this one. I received this toiletry bag for an exchange for an review of this bag.</li>
    <li> This bag was exactly what I thought I was getting. The quality is very good and the double zippers allowed more room to pack all the tolietries for a trip. The handle makes it easy to carry.</li>
    <li> Great bag! Love the two compartments to keep things organized and the heavy duty zippers</li>
    <li> My husband loves his new bag. Shipping was really quick and the product is exactly what is described. Very good quality and a lot of room for all his things.</li>
    <li> Really needed a bag like this for my constant travelling. It works great and fits everything, while being easy to carry and store. Overall, this product is awesome and is offered at more than a fair price.</li>
    <li> I bought this toiletry bag for my son for Christmas.  It&#x27;s really the perfect size and should hold everything he needs while traveling.  The two separate compartments are great and will help keep hair gel from the toothbrush should a spill happen.  The inside should clean easily so that&#x27;s a bonus! Roomy without being to big.</li>
    <li> Very nice, good material. And lovely to look at.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion.  Lightweight, with ample room for toiletries in two zipper pockets on top (one large - 3&amp;#34; x 10&amp;#34;, one smaller - 1&amp;#34; x 10&amp;#34;) and a side zipper pocket.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product and awesome customer service!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to put all of the things he needs for bathing, shaving, etc in. He is very happy with it and even with all the use it&#x27;s still in tact and hasn&#x27;t ripped or messed up. He relegiously uses this bag every day and night.</li>
    <li> Love this bag, everything I thought it would be. Sleek, durable design with lots of space for all those little extras.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This toiletry bag is incredible.  The fact that it is washable makes everything incredibly easy.</li>
    <li> Great toiletry bag. As a road warrior who stays in hotels more than my own house, it fits everything I need. My strategy has been to put the liquids in a TSA approved ziplock and place that in one of the larger pockets. In the other large pocket, I place items such as a toothbrush, razor, deodorant, etc. Finally, in the smallest side pocket, I put smaller items such as Band-Aids, chapstick, etc. It&#x27;s a perfect size to fit at the top of my carry-on suitcase. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Good design. Good length for all items. 3 compartments. Handle for carrying. Flexible and collapsible.</li>
    <li> Great customer care but the bag looked cheap, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Had used a toiletry bag that was my grandfathers.  When he passed away, some 20 years ago, the grandkids got to get something in his memory.  I took the toiletry bag and used it faithfully when going on trips.  During these 20 years, it had really began to show wear and I wanted something to continue using on trips.  When I found this one online, I wasn&#x27;t sure about the quality or size.  When I received it, I was very well pleased.  I like the fact it&#x27;s expandable and it&#x27;s leather.</li>
    <li> I used to have 3 different toiletry bags that I would use for different situations but with this one,I am organized for any type of travel</li>
    <li> Very nice Toiletry Bag.  It stores toiletry items nicely.  The size is just right for my needs and love the fact that it has dual storage. I thought a would have more of a leather look, but still a very nice bag.</li>
    <li> Sturdy with plenty of compartments. My husband was wishing it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> My husband had his &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; bag for about 40 years....I finally talked him into replacing it.  He really liked that old bag.  Once this new bag arrived, he didn&#x27;t wait but a few minutes to try it out...turns out to be just what he wanted.  The bag is very soft and holds everything he needs. Very good quality and, it turns out, wonderful customer support as well.  We received an e-mail just to make sure my husband was satisfied and that the product had arrived in perfect shape....who does that any more?  Thanks &amp;#34;Pure Sir&amp;#34; for such a great product....the new &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34; bag!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift to my boyfriend and to be honest when i opened the package, i wasn&#x27;t impressed with the bag. I would say it wasn&#x27;t what I expected it to be or pictured it to be. But when my boyfriend received the bag, he LOVED it! And said that it was perfect for him! It has a simple yet elegant design. I&#x27;m so happy to hear those words! Seriously, I never expected it would turn out that positively. Two thumbs up,</li>
    <li> Very good quality..I am on the road for almost 300 days..each year..so I&#x27;ll be giving it a good workout..!</li>
    <li> very nice bag, just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Forget the other Toiletry bags. The nice thing about this one is not only that is has two compartments, but that it is a FULL 12 inches wide. This adds an extra measure if convenience because situations arise where you need a private place to store additional travel items and maybe an item or two that is just a little bit bigger than the standard travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An additional nicety is that the zippers are not those funky cheap ones. The tabs actually have some heft to them and are a good 1 inch long - enough so that you can quickly get a good  grip on them. (I despise the little dinky zipper tabs - especially ones that BREAK OFF!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of my cutters go into the zippered side compartment. This alleviates worry about reaching into a heavily populated bag. So for instance my side compartment has a flat lint remover, full-size nail clippers, small scissors, and a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an interesting compartment design - a prima-facia look at it might lead you to believe that the bag has two equally sized compartments. This could not be farther from the truth!  Though the compartment zippers are symmetrically spaced for aesthetic appeal from the outside, you quickly find that one compartment is quite a bit larger than the other. The divider between the two compartments is on an angle and so actually goes to the far corner of one of the compartments - making one quite large. This turns out to be be quite a bonus. You almost don&#x27;t have to worry about the size of items at all - as long as they are 12 inches or shorter, you can load them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My large compartment contains: SpinBrush (toothbrush),Gillette Fusion Gel, half-size toothpaste, mouthwash, alcohol, small shampoo, deodorant, bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller compartment contains such ancillaries as: Zyrtec, Benadryl, Aleve, q-Tips, small comb, cologne, pill cutter, emergency ipod(gotta have one!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that you can start filling the bag up with the sizes that you like and then reduce the size of an item only if you have to. All in all, a great travel bag.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace a toiletry bag I had for nearly 30 years and looked far and wide until I found this one. It meets my needs extremely well.</li>
    <li> its nice bag in future i will buy new collection</li>
    <li> Not what I expected! Low quality for the price!!</li>
    <li> Nice bag very roomy perfect for travel and good quality</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit for work and pleasure, so I decided to finally put down a few bucks on a quality dopp kit. Pure Sir&#x27;s toiletry bag is a fine way to tote my aftershave, deodorant, toothpaste, brushes, and other items. It&#x27;s surprisingly spacious, too. There are two main zippered compartments (one of which has a short divider) and third zippered area on the side. It&#x27;s my new favorite thing, and I wish I purchased it sooner!</li>
    <li> Was looking for a toiletry bag with two compartments, to keep my beard supplies in one side and other items in the second zippered compartment. This bag fits the bill and has some style to it too. Will be keeping an eye out for other Pure Sir products in the future.</li>
    <li> it has more space than i thought and the zippers appear very durable...!!!&lt;br /&gt;the bag is not leather but it appears so in the picture...</li>
    <li> Pretty nice bag, although for the money I was expecting a little bit better quality. It feels a bit flimsy...</li>
    <li> Was expecting it to be high quality since it costs $100.00, but it was more like an inexpensive $25.00 shaving bag. J C Pennys sells better ones for $35.00 or so that hold just as much. I returned the item because it was disappointing. Luckily Amazon has an easy return system in place so I just sent it back.</li>
    <li> Great quality bag, love the two compartments the zippers look and work really great !</li>
    <li> Bought this item as a gift, looks great and its spacious.</li>
