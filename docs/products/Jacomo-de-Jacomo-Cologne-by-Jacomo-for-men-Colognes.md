<li> Thirty years ago I used to buy the entire Jacomo line,especially the cologne and deodorant, but you can&#x27;t find the other items anymore.</li>
<li> but this time it looks like stored for a very long time</li>
<li> It was a gift for someone who tries other colognes and keeps coming back to this one.</li>
<li> I wore this back in the 80&#x27;s, had a hard time finding it since then, found it here, ordered it</li>
<li> the scent might be a little sharp at the beginning  </li>
<li> it mellows out after a few minutes.</li>

    <li> A familiar scent that still gets compliments.  It was a gift for someone who tries other colognes and keeps coming back to this one. It is not musky and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache when I am in an enclosed area with the person wearing it.</li>
