      <li>The nail polish was packaged in a nice box (inside of a protective shipping box) and was shipped promptly.  </li>

      <li>The reason why I purchased these was because I like to perform my own product reviews from time to time.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my wife who seen the collection of colors and really liked it.  </li>

      <li>and I am contacting the Better Business Bureau ....</li>
      <li>I gave it one star because the product is purposely misleading people into thinking that they&#x27;re buying 5x more than the actuality-</li>
      <li>Especially the crackle is a great way for girls to want to have a girls night!</li>
      <li>gets the job done in a stylish way.</li>
      <li>With this set, I can wear how ever many I want</li>
      <li>when u wash your hand this nail paint get removed, it did not stay more then 3 hours.</li>
      <li>wanted to help out :)</li>
      <li>most if the nail polish worked... a couple of the colors did not crackle like it was supposed to....</li>
      <li>The colors mostly looked muted and muddy.</li>
      <li>Really Cute gift for girls /teenagers</li>
      <li>Both the girls I gave these to were highly pleased.  </li>
      <li>Get ready to have your nails look so cool and for a truly amazing price!!</li>
      <li>So paint away and Have fun with it !!</li>
      <li>Your getting 12 amazing products that gives you summer in a bottle with these strong vivid colors!!  </li>
      <li>So I avoid putting it on my cheap nail polish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really dissapointed, was a gift to my girl friend since she liked the colors in pack</li>
      <li>The variety is fun and will give them plenty of chances to be creative.</li>
      <li>Once opened they looked OK and worth a try.</li>
      <li>But overall it&#x27;s nice to have if looking for a wide-range of colors!</li>
      <li>Paint each nail a diffrent color for summer, SUPER FUN!</li>
      <li>I love the variety of colors because most companies only have 2 or 3 shades!</li>
      <li>This set is pretty affordable and allows for a ton of color combinations!</li>
      <li>This set come with 12 colors, some bright and some dark.</li>
      <li>is very light and would require atleast 2-3 coats before actually covering the nail with color.</li>
      <li>so finding a bigger bottle is better.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Shany!</li>
      <li>For those of you who want to do the math before buying :) &#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;first off, WARNING: THE BOTTLES ARE NOT 15 FLUID OUNCES</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>I love all the different shades of crackle you can get in this set.</li>
      <li>The price is fair, but if you get 2 or 3 dried up bottles in every box.</li>
      <li>these crackles are actually at a really good price, they come out to around $2 each which is not bad considering that at the drugstore one crackle alone would be at least $5.</li>
      <li>The bottles are small and the colors are not has bright has they appeir in the picture</li>
      <li>The price is so cheap compared to some of the other companies with the same kind of crackle polish.</li>
      <li>Most of them were DRY!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find crackle polish in bright colors without spending alot of money.</li>
      <li>REALLY DISAPOINTED</li>
      <li>Much nicer than I had anticipated.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t put too much nail polish on the brush because the cracked look won&#x27;t come out correctly.</li>
      <li>(seasoned nail polish consumers know the standard is 0.5 fl.</li>
      <li>COMPLETE RIP OFF!</li>
      <li>I love the crackled look but hate the price of most!</li>
      <li>you can not return it, a huge waste of money, do yourself a favor and do not purchase this.</li>
      <li>Definitely WREAKED a toxic odor so much so that I questioned even gift wrapping it.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about tracking down all the colors because they are all right</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve kept in mind that it is a decent price for a crackle if you&#x27;re not near any dollar stores</li>
      <li>they do not work very well, and the polish dries up in the bottle even with lid tightly closed.  </li>
      <li>Ordered several of these for swag bags and in every set 2 to 3 bottles were dried up and the colors are no where near as vibrant as pictured.  </li>

<li> It does not crack as pretty as I thought and the nail polish is thick and it smudges.</li>
<li> In all I think this buy would save money in the long run.</li>
<li> trying to help people see its actual size because all my other searches over the internet claim it&#x27;s 15 fl.</li>
<li> Takes a very long time to dry and crackle.</li>
<li> just sits there to dry up...</li>
<li> , smaller bottles are never worth it because there is always going to be some leftover in a bottle that can&#x27;t be used/</li>
<li> I wanted every single color that was out there!</li>
<li> Someone who knows how to do crackle in other colors besides black or white!</li>
<li> The crackel part doesn&#x27;t work on all colors and you have to put a base coat down in order for most of them to work.</li>
<li> , faster the chucking (1-star down for that).&lt;br /&gt;again,</li>
<li> The nail polish came completely dried out.</li>
<li> I had some of the colors didn&#x27;t even have paint in them, they where dried up.</li>
<li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.....</li>
<li> how ever two of mine arrived dried out.</li>
<li> One color was completely dried up even before opening/using.</li>
<li> Number 3 3 bottles were dried up...</li>
<li> Five colors are completely dried up.</li>
<li> REALLY SMALL BOTTLES  </li>
<li> Please note video where I will show you the \\&quot;Crackle effect\\&quot; and dried polish!</li>
<li> I wasted my money on this one!</li>
<li> When we recieved the shipment from Amazon she tried using it, it did not work at all, the product was horrible and to top it off</li>
<li> ONE CAME BROKEN AND DRIED UP</li>
<li> And when I say paint, I mean paint.</li>
<li> Small bottles, one of which was broken or defective.</li>
<li> They ended up being completely dried and useless.</li>
<li> Not a good product, at all.</li>
<li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting OPI Shatter quality, but disappointed results for teen daughters to goof around with.</li>
<li> Bad product, some nail polish were dry, could not use them.</li>
<li> Two are very thick and can&#x27;t be used.</li>
<li> This is the worse thing I have ever received from Amazon...</li>
<li> Even with a thin layer.</li>
<li> All in all this was thrown away and not a great experience.</li>
<li> it is really bad quality.</li>
<li> POOR QUALITY!!!</li>

    <li> I love this set of cracked polish from Shany! The price is so cheap compared to some of the other companies with the same kind of crackle polish. You get an entire set of 12 different colors in a big bottle! Lots of variety, and it cracks well. LOVE IT!</li>

    <li> Someone who knows how to do crackle in other colors besides black or white! And sooo cheap! I&#x27;ve actually paid 6 bucks for one crackle that didn&#x27;t even crackle! These are amazing alone or as a top coat. I love the variety of colors because most companies only have 2 or 3 shades! Thanks Shany!</li>
    <li> When all my friends had crackle nails I was so jealous. I wanted every single color that was out there! With this set, I can wear how ever many I want and they are in a set so I don&#x27;t have to worry about tracking down all the colors because they are all right here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FUN TIP: Paint each nail a diffrent color for summer, SUPER FUN!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy Shany has a variety of cracked colors! These are perfect for spring and summer! Don&#x27;t put too much nail polish on the brush because the cracked look won&#x27;t come out correctly. It works great but it won&#x27;t work on all your nail polishes. So I avoid putting it on my cheap nail polish. I have Shany nail polish and it works perfectly with those.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find crackle polish in bright colors without spending alot of money. These go on great and are bold &amp; bright. They wear well and are well-worth the money!</li>
    <li> most if the nail polish worked... a couple of the colors did not crackle like it was supposed to.... thanks!</li>
    <li> Really Cute gift for girls /teenagers that LOVE doing their nails! Especially the crackle is a great way for girls to want to have a girls night! Also great for adults! You just would need to buy a base color to use the crackle</li>
    <li> Both the girls I gave these to were highly pleased.  The variety is fun and will give them plenty of chances to be creative.</li>
    <li> Get ready to have your nails look so cool and for a truly amazing price!! Your getting 12 amazing products that gives you summer in a bottle with these strong vivid colors!!

    <li> The nail polish came completely dried out. the colors were not as bright has they appeared. And CAN NOT BE RETURNED! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.....COMPLETE RIP OFF!</li>
    <li> This is the worse thing I have ever received from Amazon... These people know just what they are selling and I am contacting the Better Business Bureau .... You would be insulted if you received this from a store why should Amazon be any different? Number 1. The polish looks like water color paint when applied Number 2. It does not crackle at all... Number 3 3 bottles were dried up... Please note video where I will show you the \\&quot;Crackle effect\\&quot; and dried polish!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my teen age daughter for Christmas. Five colors are completely dried up. Two are very thick and can&#x27;t be used. This is not a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; purchase. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Received item in seal-wrapped plastic inside beat-up cardboard box. Definitely WREAKED a toxic odor so much so that I questioned even gift wrapping it. Small bottles, one of which was broken or defective. One color was completely dried up even before opening/using. For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting OPI Shatter quality, but disappointed results for teen daughters to goof around with.</li>
    <li> REALLY SMALL BOTTLES  ONE CAME BROKEN AND DRIED UP AND THEY DIDN&#x27;T DO WHAT THEY WHERE SUPPOSE TO DO&lt;br /&gt; REALLY DISAPOINTED</li>
    <li> Not a good product, at all. Takes a very long time to dry and crackle. Even with a thin layer. I had some of the colors didn&#x27;t even have paint in them, they where dried up. And when I say paint, I mean paint. This is not nail polish. Figure paint in a bottle. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> wastage of money. it is like water color. when u wash your hand this nail paint get removed, it did not stay more then 3 hours. unless, i did not get any refund or money back</li>
    <li> they do not work very well, and the polish dries up in the bottle even with lid tightly closed.  The crackel part doesn&#x27;t work on all colors and you have to put a base coat down in order for most of them to work.</li>
    <li> it is really bad quality. I would not have bought this if I had known how terrible it is. It does not crack as pretty as I thought and the nail polish is thick and it smudges.</li>
    <li> &#x3D;&#x3D;For those of you who want to do the math before buying :) &#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;first off, WARNING: THE BOTTLES ARE NOT 15 FLUID OUNCES AS STATED!&lt;br /&gt;-proof in the pictures, zoomed into one u can read \\&quot;0.27 fl oz\\&quot; off the blue&lt;br /&gt;-12 bottles x 0.27 fl oz is only 3.24 fl oz. (seasoned nail polish consumers know the standard is 0.5 fl. oz.)&lt;br /&gt;25dollars divided between 3.24 oz is &#x3D; $7.72/ fl. oz.&lt;br /&gt;divide that by 2 because the standard bottle is 0.5 fl. oz. and you find out&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re paying $3.86 per 0.5 fl. oz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just trying to help people see its actual size because all my other searches over the internet claim it&#x27;s 15 fl. oz... 15oz compared to the reality of 3.24oz is a vicious lie. I gave it one star because the product is purposely misleading people into thinking that they&#x27;re buying 5x more than the actuality- and it&#x27;s such a shame that this wasn&#x27;t corrected here or anywhere else. I&#x27;ve kept in mind that it is a decent price for a crackle if you&#x27;re not near any dollar stores (1-star up for that)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;imo, smaller bottles are never worth it because there is always going to be some leftover in a bottle that can&#x27;t be used/ just sits there to dry up... so finding a bigger bottle is better.  *Smaller the bottle, faster the chucking (1-star down for that).&lt;br /&gt;again, the size named is a lie- these are practically minisized!&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to help out :) please share warning, somebody has to rename the product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife who seen the collection of colors and really liked it.  When we recieved the shipment from Amazon she tried using it, it did not work at all, the product was horrible and to top it off you can not return it, a huge waste of money, do yourself a favor and do not purchase this.</li>
    <li> Received this intact and boxed however, the chemical smell radiating from the sealed box was horrendous! Once opened they looked OK and worth a try. They ended up being completely dried and useless. Not returnable. All in all this was thrown away and not a great experience.</li>
    <li> gets the job done in a stylish way. how ever two of mine arrived dried out. cant beat the deal though</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really dissapointed, was a gift to my girl friend since she liked the colors in pack but she was dissapointed after applying.&lt;br /&gt;This is very light and would require atleast 2-3 coats before actually covering the nail with color.</li>
    <li> POOR QUALITY!!! Most of them were DRY! I tried to send a message to the company, they replied once but never replied after that. I wasted my money on this one! I am so disappointed!</li>
    <li> Bad product, some nail polish were dry, could not use them.</li>
    <li> The reason why I purchased these was because I like to perform my own product reviews from time to time. The price is fair, but if you get 2 or 3 dried up bottles in every box. You&#x27;re wasting money. DO NOT buy. Also they are 0.27 Fl Oz.</li>
    <li> Ordered several of these for swag bags and in every set 2 to 3 bottles were dried up and the colors are no where near as vibrant as pictured.  The colors mostly looked muted and muddy.</li>
    <li> Much nicer than I had anticipated.  The nail polish was packaged in a nice box (inside of a protective shipping box) and was shipped promptly.  The colors are great and very bright -which was perfect for the teenager it was given to as a gift.  She had her nails painted within 15 minutes in blue, - and they looked just like the photo said they should look.</li>
