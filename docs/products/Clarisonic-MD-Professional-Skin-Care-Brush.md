      <li>uncle is a plastic surgeon with a skincare clinic and has been promoting ultrasonic plated devices for *years* to help products penetrate the skin better.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product over two weeks ago, and I just love the results.  </li>
      <li>But don&#x27;t expect the Clarisonic by itself to be some magical cure.    </li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did.   </li>
      <li>It has a healthy glow that was not there before.</li>
      <li>So, it makes your skin look better</li>
      <li>I swear by this product and have just purchased 3 more as Christmas gifts.  </li>
      <li>- I spend $500+ a year on facials anyhow, what&#x27;s $200 more?    </li>
      <li>and while it&#x27;s improved a great deal with age, I still have more than my fair share of clogged pores (especially on the nose).  </li>
      <li>and I was quite pleased with how this made them shrink.  </li>
      <li>I would love to coment on this product, but I never recieved it.</li>
      <li>They need more than one button on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ultrasonic waves help push the product into the skin more than using fingers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It also helps my skin absorbs the lotions much better these days.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had my brush for many months</li>
      <li>I saw this product on Oprah&#x27;s \\&quot;favorite things\\&quot; episode.</li>
      <li>The Clarisonic claims to wash your face much better because it forces the cleansers into your skin/pores.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m not even sure if they have one.)</li>
      <li>I now use it strictly on the lower setting and it&#x27;s much better.    </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
      <li>really like the look of the Silver, but mine still works great after 2 years, so maybe I&#x27;ll upgrade when or if this one dies.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt much more damaged afterwards and my acne wounds wouldn&#x27;t heal.  </li>
      <li>We both already took pretty good care of our skin</li>
      <li>EXPEDITIOUSLY AND VERY COURTEOUSLY SHIPPED A NEW UNIT WITHOUT DELAY.</li>
      <li>However, that&#x27;s not to say that the Clarisonic doesn&#x27;t help with acne -- it certainly helps your acne treatment products penetrate better, thus making them more effective.  </li>
      <li>(Differin may have contributed to the dryness and irritation I experienced early on).    </li>
      <li>I love my Sonic Care toothbrush (in fact we recommend them at the dental office I work at because we&#x27;ve seen such great results in our patients)</li>
      <li>This thing is for cleansing, it&#x27;s great at removing dead surface skin cells, and whatever moisturizer/serum/treatment you use afterwards will be much more effective.  </li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of the Sonicare toothbrush</li>
      <li>and I have noticed a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge huge difference.  </li>
      <li>and they probably make a HUGE profit on it.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my neck also and experienced the same results.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels smooth after each use.  </li>
      <li>He originally founded Skinceuticals, then defected to form Phytoceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Clarisonic with my C serum for one month, my skin is so smooth and glowing with a brightness i had not seen before.</li>
      <li>Maybe over time it will improve but right now, do not expect much more than clean skin from this gadget.</li>
      <li>This product makes my skin feel squeaky clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is a great cleaner, fun to use and really well made - very high quality construction.  </li>
      <li>Blackheads, acne blemishes, all reduced significantly.    </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s fun to use it too!</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, the brush does clean my face well.  </li>
      <li>I like to clean mine with antibacterial soap before every use.  </li>
      <li>It thoroughly cleans the skin; leaving it \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean.  </li>
      <li>I use the brush with a very mildly abrasive glycolic cleanser (against the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations, for what it&#x27;s worth, but my esthetician said it&#x27;s alright</li>
      <li>You must be sure to get the stabilized kind, such as Phytoceuticals C+E serum,</li>
      <li>If this is true, then products that were formulated for hand-cleansing all of a sudden start to work much more effectively than before.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;body butter absorbed right away instead of sitting on top of my skin.</li>
      <li>I took me a good year to finally purchase this product because of this reason.     </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great because it is timed for each section of your face, so it beeps and pauses for you to transition to your other cheek or forehead.</li>
      <li>When I first heard about this brush, it interested me because I love my Sonicare toothbrush</li>
      <li>I still use Differin a couple of times a week, and I think it&#x27;s more effective due to the brush</li>
      <li>While I find this to be positive, for $200 I really expect much more out of this device.  </li>
      <li>I also use my on my neck which has really helped w/the fine lines.</li>
      <li>I figured it was worth trying this brush</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s fun to use.  </li>
      <li>It is worth $200.</li>
      <li>it worth $200?  </li>
      <li>I am witness to the results from my own family members and his patients --seeing a huge difference in glow, firmness, texture, and brightness to their skin due to improved Vit. C serum absorption.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of removing makeup and other build-up.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t already use a gentle cleanser, you might want to start with something like the original formula Cetaphil.  </li>
      <li>it right up</li>
      <li>-- they sink right into my skin.  </li>
      <li>I gave this product 4 stars because as great as it is, the price is a bit much for the average person.</li>
      <li>I experienced a little irritation at first, including some peeling and dryness during the first week in patches.  </li>
      <li>The product is very nice to use, but just remember, the batteries only last about 4-5 years, and then the product will not work anymore, PERIOD!</li>
      <li>I used it for over a month with the Clarisonic cleanser at first.  </li>
      <li>I have had acne since I was in middle school, and I still have MANY under-the-skin bumps that look like congested sebum deposits.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am very happy with my clarisonic. It has helped my skin stay clear without irritating it. It also makes any product I put on after using it, such as moisturiser or retin-A absorb better.</li>
    <li> I would definately suggest to anyone considering this spendy purchase to go ahead and throw caution to the wind..you won&#x27;t be disappointed!! Infact I was considering purchasing a second one just to put in my travel bag so I would never leave it behind by mistake! Altho I am past the acne stage I love the feel of tight,squeaky clean skin,youthful glow is an achievement this can provide!!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have been using this brush and it has made a huge difference in our skin!  We both already took pretty good care of our skin but this brush had our pores noticeable clearer, and skin tighter after the first use.  This brush works better on reducing the appearance of wrinkles than any eye cream I have ever used : )</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the Sonicare toothbrush so I was elated when the company came out with a skin care product.  I have been using Clarisonic for over a month and I have to say I have seen very little change in my skin.  My pores are unchanged.  There has been no extra firmness.  The clarity and evenness of my skin are unchanged.  I have seen no real reduction in break-outs (but I am not one who suffers from tremendous bouts of acne).  I get the occasional blemish and, despite the Clarisonic, the occasional blemishes still find their way to the surface.    I do think for someone who has trouble cleaning her face at night, the Clarisonic might be useful.  It does a good job of removing makeup and other build-up.  While I find this to be positive, for $200 I really expect much more out of this device.  I am disappointed.  A $200 makeup remover is not what I had in mind.    This gadget, in no way, compares to the company&#x27;s toothbrush line.  I think many, including myself, bought into the Clarisonic because of the great experience with Sonicare.  Unfortunately, the Clarisonic is not yet the gem that the Sonicare is.  Maybe over time it will improve but right now, do not expect much more than clean skin from this gadget.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for three months now. I noticed a difference immediately after using it.  It thoroughly cleans the skin; leaving it \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean.  My skin feels smooth after each use.  I use it on my neck also and experienced the same results.  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonic Care toothbrush (in fact we recommend them at the dental office I work at because we&#x27;ve seen such great results in our patients) so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. The skin care brush is definitely fun to use, but didn&#x27;t deliver any noticable changes to my 38 year old face. I was so disappointed. A Buf Puf would give you the same results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 40 and on a skin-care regimen that includes tretinoin (\\&quot;Retin-A\\&quot;) and hydroquinone to brighten my skin.  I looked like a flaky mess - seriously gross - until I started using the Clarisonic brush.  The cleanser that came with it gave me acne, so I used a spendy \\&quot;foaming cleanser\\&quot; (Obagi) that seems to work very well with it.  I&#x27;m usually of the opinion that soap is soap and that moisturizer (and other face gunk) makes the difference, but I have changed my mind after using the cleanser that came with.  Not so great.  Also, once or twice a week, I put a dab of this totally amazing exfoliant scrub on the brush and it&#x27;s made a huge huge difference.  (The scrub is \\&quot;Daniel Pry Organic Complexion &#x27;Micro Polish.&#x27;\\&quot;  MAN, that stuff is incredible.  When used with this brush, I think I could use just those two products and save the cash on the other facial stuff.)  The only part of my herkin&#x27; skin care regimen that I actually enjoy is this brush.  It feels like a mini-massage.  I&#x27;m extra careful with pressure on my cheeks since that&#x27;s my problem area, but man my skin looks amazing.  I may have to dab a little concealer under my eyes, but using this brush completely removes the dullness I usually experience.  I would recommend this brush for dullness, but I&#x27;d be cautious with active acneic skin.</li>
    <li> It actually does what it says it will do. It cleans your skin, incredibly deeply and thoroughly, you face looks like it&#x27;s glowing after you&#x27;ve used this thing. It&#x27;s expensive, sure, but if you spend a fortune on face products, etc. then you should invest in this instead.  So, it makes your skin look better, that&#x27;s it&#x27;s job and it works. It won&#x27;t knock 20 years off you, but I&#x27;ve had a number of people telling me how well I looked since using it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> For reference, I am in my early twenties.  I have had acne since I was in middle school, and I still have MANY under-the-skin bumps that look like congested sebum deposits.    I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic for about four months now.  Everything was great at the beginning but after a while things started going downhill, and it took me a while to figure out why.  My comments below are some words of caution.    First of all, the Clarisonic is a wonderful cleanser.  My face is very smooth after using it, and whatever products I use afterwards -- moisturizers, gels, etc -- they sink right into my skin.  Note that if you want this thing for microdermabrasion though, it may not be your best bet.  Hardcore microdermabrasion is like sanding the skin -- you can, for example, get a Neutrogena electronic microdermabrasion system for ~$35.    Second, be careful what cleanser you pair this with.  A lot of what I used to clean my face with -- Dove bar soap, gel cleansers, etc -- actually started to work TOO well!  The Clarisonic claims to wash your face much better because it forces the cleansers into your skin/pores.  If this is true, then products that were formulated for hand-cleansing all of a sudden start to work much more effectively than before.  Yes you do get that squeaky-clean feeling, but if you&#x27;re too aggressive about it, your normal cleansers may end up stripping your skin.    Third, the Clarisonic comes with two different speed settings.  When I used the lower setting, everything was great.  My skin never felt sanded off, and even when I had slightly broken skin from acne, the Clarisonic actually helped my acne wounds heal FASTER!  However, after I used this on the higher speed setting, things changed.  My skin felt much more damaged afterwards and my acne wounds wouldn&#x27;t heal.  My acne actually got worse (at the time I used my Clarisonic with Dove bar soap), my skin felt dry and scaly.  I now use it strictly on the lower setting and it&#x27;s much better.    Fourth, to my disappointment, this thing does not cure acne.  It didn&#x27;t help all that much with my under-the-skin bumps either.  In order to get that stuff out of my face, I had to turn to one of those metal black-head-removers (Sephora sells them for $16, I got mine from Avon for $3).  However, that&#x27;s not to say that the Clarisonic doesn&#x27;t help with acne -- it certainly helps your acne treatment products penetrate better, thus making them more effective.  But don&#x27;t expect the Clarisonic by itself to be some magical cure.    Fifth, if you wear makeup, DON&#x27;T USE THE CLARISONIC FOR MAKEUP REMOVAL!!  That would be the equivalent of rubbing all of the makeup deep into your pores.  Instead, remove makeup with a makeup remover first, like Ponds Cold Cream / Philosophy Purity Made Simple / etc.      Sixth, remember to clean the brush head, especially if you have acne or other skin conditions.  I like to clean mine with antibacterial soap before every use.  This way I&#x27;m not rubbing bacteria into my skin every time I use it.    If you&#x27;re thinking about buying the Clarisonic, I&#x27;d tell you to have reasonable expectations for this product.  This thing is for cleansing, it&#x27;s great at removing dead surface skin cells, and whatever moisturizer/serum/treatment you use afterwards will be much more effective.  However, thinking that this will be a magical cure-all will only set you up for disappointment.    I hope my Clarisonic will last a long long time because if mine ever broke, I&#x27;d seriously consider buying another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my brush for many months and it&#x27;s never had a single problem which, of course, doesn&#x27;t mean they are all perfect.  I&#x27;ve had yucky skin for decades and have purchased every automatic skin product I&#x27;ve come across -- the one where you stick your head in a bowl of bubbling water (I nearly drowned), the little face steamer that didn&#x27;t have a temperature control and produced live steam to the scalding point and then eventually started sparking and self-destructed, the battery-operated brushes with different \\&quot;heads\\&quot; that did nothing, etc.  Once I discovered the Murad product line, I enjoyed a vast improvement but it was THE BRUSH in conjunction with the Murad products and the dozens of skin scrubs, toners, cleansers that cleared my complexion practically overnight.  I could actually see a difference after using it only once!  Plus it&#x27;s fun to use.  I swear by this product and have just purchased 3 more as Christmas gifts.  Even if you have a good complexion, this is the tool for you!</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Oprah&#x27;s \\&quot;favorite things\\&quot; episode. I figure if she uses it, I must try it! I absolutely love this brush. It is worth $200. When I first got it, I was very anxious to use it and I had to wait 4-5 hours before it was charged. The recommedation charge time is 24 hours, but who really does that?     This product makes my skin feel squeaky clean and smooth. My skin condition is oily and I wear light makeup on a daily basis.     It comes with an extra brush head, also a coupon for two free brushes.    I&#x27;m not the kind to splurge on beauty products and I probably got 2-3 facial treatments in my life. This is a must have product! I think it&#x27;s fun to use it too! I always look forward to use it and I really can&#x27;t do without this thing now!</li>
    <li> PRODUCT IN GENERAL WORKS AS DESCRIBED AND BENEFITS ARE VISIBLE WHEN USED AS DIRECTED. Unfortunately, product failed after 8 months of daily use. The email address and toll free number for customer service for CLARISONIC is completely useless and dead. After my brush became defective, I contacted Clarisonic Customer Service for repair/exchange. Sent five emails over a a two month period, left message on answer machine at Clarisonic customer service and absolutely no answer. The warranty of one year is completely useless at this point. A wise consumer and purchaser should be given a reliable customer service when purchasing this product at this price. USE THE PRODUCT WHILE IT WORKS. When it stops, THROW IT AWAY because you WILL NOT get a response from Clarisonic directly.      UPDATE ON JULY 16, 2007: CLARISONIC CALLED ME DIRECTLY AND FACILITATED  A FULL REPLACEMENT OF THE THE DEFECTIVE UNIT EXPEDITIOUSLY AND VERY COURTEOUSLY SHIPPED A NEW UNIT WITHOUT DELAY. DEFINITELY WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TOWARDS THE END!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, dry skin and large pores.  So far this has worked really well for me.  My skin looks great.  Less flaky skin on my face, more even skin tone.  Due to skin sensitivity though, I&#x27;m only using it a few times a week now with the sensitive brush.  Gives you that soft-feeling skin you get after an expensive facial.  This is expensive, but worth it in my opinion as it gives you spa results, but will be cheaper over time as facials are quite expensive.  I&#x27;ve purchased the brush for delicate skin also, but haven&#x27;t used that.</li>
    <li> I have only used my Clarisonic brush for couple weeks and I have noticed a huge difference in my skin.  It does clean very effectively and efficiently as advertised.  It also helps my skin absorbs the lotions much better these days.  I have not come across any issues at this point as I have seen from other reviews.  If anything comes up with my Clarisonic brush, I will definitely report it.  But for now, I love my Clarisonic brush and it has been my daily ritual.</li>
    <li> In response to someone complaining about the customer service : My Clarisonic stopped charging after just 3 months.  I called the 800 number and spoke to a CSR on the first call.  Very helpful and stated they would send out a replacement charger/handle with a prepaid return.  Received it 5 days after the call.  I am extremely impressed with the service.  I accept mechanical failures as part of life.&lt;br /&gt;Use 2x a day and the results are clearer, brighter skin. Had a facial recently and she commented on how great my skin was looking.  One word of advice,  use a nonfoaming cleanser.</li>
    <li> Be careful which Clarisonic product your purchase.  Look for the Clarisonic MD, which is the newest/latest model.  Some vendors, like Sephora, are still selling the old model (with less features) at the same price.  With the MD model, you get three speeds and three brushes.      I know this because some friends gave me a $200.00 gift certificate to buy the Clarisonic brush from Sephora.  When I attempted to purchase the item from Sephora, in the store and on the Internet, I realized Sephora was only selling the older model.  Talk about frustrated B-day gift purpose, this was in February of this year and Sephora still has not updated its stock.</li>
    <li> I am 47 years old and have been using this for a few weeks now.  This is a great cleaner, fun to use and really well made - very high quality construction.  I have always had rather large pores on my checks and nose and I was quite pleased with how this made them shrink.  The unit came with a soft and medium brush, so my wife and I can share it by changing the brushes.</li>
    <li> I had terrible skin as a teenager into my 20&#x27;s - went on Accutane twice - and while it&#x27;s improved a great deal with age, I still have more than my fair share of clogged pores (especially on the nose).  My esthetician recommended this brush a couple of months ago, and I figured what the heck - I spend $500+ a year on facials anyhow, what&#x27;s $200 more?    This little gadget has been worth every penny.  I haven&#x27;t had a single major breakout since I started using it - not one.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of tiny spots in the past two months, both of which died out on their own after a few days.  The pores on my nose, which have been huge and blocked for two decades, are a half to a quarter their former size, and a few are now at least occasionally clear.  Even Accutane couldn&#x27;t manage that feat - facials could clear them out, but only for a day or two.    For me, this brush has been like a daily facial.  My skin got a little better right away, and has continued to slowly improve over the past two months.  I experienced a little irritation at first, including some peeling and dryness during the first week in patches.  I still use Differin a couple of times a week, and I think it&#x27;s more effective due to the brush (Differin may have contributed to the dryness and irritation I experienced early on).    I use the brush with a very mildly abrasive glycolic cleanser (against the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations, for what it&#x27;s worth, but my esthetician said it&#x27;s alright if I don&#x27;t press too hard).  I&#x27;d recommend avoiding the cleanser the brush ships with - it contains a couple of ingredients that make me breakout like crazy, especially Nonoxynol-9.  If you don&#x27;t already use a gentle cleanser, you might want to start with something like the original formula Cetaphil.  I used that at first and the brush worked well, although things really took off when I switched back to my glycolic cleanser.    Hope this product works as well for you as it has for me.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with my skin for awhile.  I have very oily patches and peely patches with acne everywhere.  I have tried the most expensive cleansers and the cheapest but nothing has made my skin feel and look like this.  Within a couple of days I was noticing difference.  My blackheads have disappeared and my flaky skin is gone.  I also suffer for sebacous dematitis and this helps tons.  The only thing I would suggest is saving your money on the expensive cleanser that it comes with and invest that money in a good moisturizer.  Cetaphil works just as well and is 1/4 the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early twenties and I am in a constant battle with my face.  I use to have really bad acne which left me with a lot of scarring.  Obagi helped a lot by getting rid of the scarring. I&#x27;m currently doing Fractional (the laser) to get rid of the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Clarisonic recently. I was little hesitant at first because of the price. But heck, it&#x27;s my face, and whatever I can do to make it a little better, it&#x27;s worth it.  I brought the limited pink version of this brush; I found it on ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the brush does clean my face well.  My face does feel cleaner and smoother after using the brush.  I like taking in to the shower with me as well to use on my body.  I use it on the back of my arms and it has helped get rid of those little red pimples.  By the way, the brush is not harsh on the face as long as you aren&#x27;t pressing down hard. By the end of the first day, I had it on high with the normal brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth $200?  No, but it&#x27;s the only one on the market in its class.  Trust me, I looked.  Nothing compares to this one.  Yes, it is definitely overpriced and they probably make a HUGE profit on it.  Probably in a year after they get some competition from other brands, it will be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do hate about the brush is the lack of buttons.  Basically one button does everything on this brush.  It turns it on, off, changes speed, changes mode...it&#x27;s ridiculous. You have to sit there and look at the manuel to figure out what one beep and one long beep means.  They need more than one button on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I hate about this brush is that you can&#x27;t replace the battery!  So, after three years when the battery breaks (and eventually they will all break), you have to purchase a new Clarisonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you have the money, go for this brush.  If you don&#x27;t...wait, in a couple of months, the price will probably drop when other brands create similar products.</li>
    <li> Because i work in the beauty industry here in New York, i see all the behind-the-scenes secrets: Incestuous suppliers, do-nothing formulas, and idiotic marketing hype. Therefore, I normally don&#x27;t push products, being so jaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... I&#x27;ve actually fallen in love with the Clarisonic, a rotating brush head cleanser that&#x27;s powered by ultrasonic waves, by the same maker as SonicCare toothbrushes. you may have heard of it, and piqued by the testimonials. And I attest to its power. Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My uncle is a plastic surgeon with a skincare clinic and has been promoting ultrasonic plated devices for *years* to help products penetrate the skin better. (Imagine a Clarisonic with a flat metal head, no bristles --I&#x27;ve used this type of device to massage serums into my skin.) I am witness to the results from my own family members and his patients --seeing a huge difference in glow, firmness, texture, and brightness to their skin due to improved Vit. C serum absorption. Think of it this way--most cremes and potions sit on top of the skin, rarely penetrating through the top layers of dead skin cells to actually work. The ultrasonic waves help push the product into the skin more than using fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarisonic takes this concept one up, starting with the cleansing step:&lt;br /&gt;Rotating bristles with ultrasonic power to remove the dead skin cells in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is more thorough deep cleansing than washing by hand. Dirt and debris get whisked away, pores are massaged and stimulated (you will notice that blackheads are easier to remove or are slightly reduced), and overall skin health is brighter and improved! and the best part is that serums/cremes/moisturizers SINK in immediately after cleansing --- skin soaks it right up b/c it&#x27;s prepped, no dead cell blockage, and&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s ready to receive your choice of anti-aging solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I would not recommend using any old moisturizer. After all, the Clarisonic study was conducted using Vitamin C penetration levels and showed some 40-60% increase in absorption, so why use a run-of-the-mill moisturizer afterwards?  This is where your actives come into play: Antioxidants, Retinol, Peptides, etc.  My uncle also uses the Vitamin C serums on his patients b/c it is one of the few things that is proven to work in clinical trials as an anti-aging superpower.  You must be sure to get the stabilized kind, such as Phytoceuticals C+E serum, (i think it&#x27;s 10-15% vitamin C) created by the doctor who first stabilized Vitamin C and then patented it. He originally founded Skinceuticals, then defected to form Phytoceuticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Clarisonic with my C serum for one month, my skin is so smooth and glowing with a brightness i had not seen before. I went back home for the holidays and everyone was commenting on my skin. Again, this is due to improved product penetration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Clarisonic on my body, and afterwards my skin was so smooth and my typically greasy&lt;br /&gt;body butter absorbed right away instead of sitting on top of my skin. But i don&#x27;t have the patience to sonic-fy my body every day (way too time-consuming).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying or using the Clarisonic brand cleanser is not necessary - it&#x27;s a non-lathering milky cleanser similar to Cetaphil. I still recommend using a makeup remover *before* cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also heard that it clears up Keratosis Pilaris (chicken skin bumps, usually on back of arms), only if you are diligent about it. I can see why this would potentially work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Clarisonic takes patience every day to go thru the routine and massage and circle your skin in small motions. Many times, after the \\&quot;honeymoon\\&quot; factor, we tend to get tired and just want to take shortcuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Clarisonic does not cure acne--the cystic kind, superficial kind, hormonal kind, or any kind. Believe me, if it did, i&#x27;d give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Hey, this machine ain&#x27;t the holygrail--but it&#x27;s pretty close.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product over two weeks ago, and I just love the results.  My skin looks and feels smoother now.  It has a healthy glow that was not there before. Blackheads, acne blemishes, all reduced significantly.    I was a bit nervous, at first, about applying a brush to some rough, sensitive patches on my face.  But they&#x27;re gone now, and surprisingly with no irritation.  Yay!  Also had white, scaly areas near side nostrils--gone now.    By the way, I use Cetaphil, which works great with the Clarisonic.  Haven&#x27;t tried the Clarisonic cleanser yet.</li>
    <li> The product is very nice to use, but just remember, the batteries only last about 4-5 years, and then the product will not work anymore, PERIOD!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have this particular model, but I have Clarisonic Dermabrasion. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I find a noticeable difference in my skin. I only wish that I had a waterproof model. (I&#x27;m not even sure if they have one.) I just was on a budget &amp; was able to get a good deal. I highly recommend the Clarisonic Skin Care Brush Line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest going to the Clarisonic website to see the different options available before purchasing. I have Rosacea and I haven&#x27;t had any issues as I purchased the diffferent brushes. I have the sensitive one for my face and a body one for the rest of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My particular model doesn&#x27;t give much warning when the battery is dead, but the light indicator tells you when it is done charging and is fairly quick. And, I use mine 2x/wk and I only have to charge it every couple of months. Mine also has 2-3 speeds. It&#x27;s great because it is timed for each section of your face, so it beeps and pauses for you to transition to your other cheek or forehead. (Keeps the guess work out of dividing the minute or so over your different facial features.) I also use my on my neck which has really helped w/the fine lines. Also ladies.... if you are a bit busty and in your 30&#x27;s you might notice wrinkles along your cleavage line... this helps w/ that also!!! Highly Recommend these products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the look of the Silver, but mine still works great after 2 years, so maybe I&#x27;ll upgrade when or if this one dies. Hope this helps! Happy Shopping! :)</li>
    <li> I have had the brush for two years and I love it.  I am 60 years old, but my skin looks younger and I credit the brush, in part, for that.  I love how it cleans and freshens my skin.</li>
    <li> I would love to coment on this product, but I never recieved it. The delivery estimate was last week, and so I wrote customer service at DERMAdocter, and they said it would come by mid January! Thanks for telling me. I will order somewhere else.</li>
    <li> My skin is pretty picky.  Dries out in the winter.  I don&#x27;t have bad, all-over acne, but I get localized breakouts on my chin and nose from time to time.  I bought the clarisonic to help control breakouts.  I used it for over a month with the Clarisonic cleanser at first.  I think this may have stimulated these breakouts.  So I switched to a gentle acne-cleanser, but didn&#x27;t see much improvement.  I use no products on my skin besides washing it in the morning and moisturizing afterwards.  No make-up or anything else.  Maybe my skin is just wide-open for this?    Ever since I started using it, my acne has gotten progressively worse.  It&#x27;s like a never-ending breakout.  So, about 3 weeks ago, I stopped using it daily, and my acne had gradually improved every since.  I use it once a week now, because no matter how much I moisturize, my skin gets dry and flaky in the winter, and the clarisonic does wonders for smoothing rough skin.  But I DO NOT recommend for people with acne-prone, but not acne-overridden, skin, like mine.</li>
    <li> When I first heard about this brush, it interested me because I love my Sonicare toothbrush &amp; I think Oprah knows a good product when she sees it.  I also thought it was a ridiculous price, particularly when I read some of the reviews on here.  I&#x27;ve had average skin my whole life, but once I hit 50, it started going downhill.  I had more breakouts than I&#x27;ve ever had &amp; my usual products were not effective.  I didn&#x27;t think my skin looked good at all - I&#x27;d have weird breakouts that didn&#x27;t look like anything I&#x27;d had in the past.  I figured it was worth trying this brush &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did.   It felt great on my skin from the first time I used it.  My skin feels smoother &amp; cleaner.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks but already I see a difference.  I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s over 50 &amp; noticing some of the problems I mentioned.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because as great as it is, the price is a bit much for the average person. I took me a good year to finally purchase this product because of this reason.     My skin broke out a lot within the past year. Ever since I started using the Clarisonic brush, it has improved. My pores still seem to be the same size as they were before using Clarisonic. I also purchased Cetaphil as a substitute cleanser and that works well too.     I wish this brush came with a travel pouch so it stays protected. I do own a Sonicare and it came with a travel case. I wish that Clarisonic had thought of this also.</li>
