    <li> They are great I just wish that it came with a little bit more product because it&#x27;s only like a quarter of the little pot</li>
    <li> This product is not worth getting. All my Lil containers were open and it was dried up. This product sucks. I tired to get a refund but I got no response back. DONT NOT PURCHASE</li>
    <li> I wont stay on with my gel polish.  Perhaps instructions would have been helpful or maybe it just doesn&#x27;t stay</li>
    <li> Mostly all the product waste out. That was terrible so it&#x27;s not even enough feel to do two hands ugh</li>
    <li> Really cute and glittery although not as much as in the picture and I thought it was a bit more base color but it&#x27;s a little clear other than that they&#x27;re great</li>
    <li> they don&#x27;t cure with LED lamps, I still need to try a UV lamp.</li>
    <li> The shipping was very fast and the colors are beautiful. But I didn&#x27;t know the colors were random so I got 3 of the same colors and not the one I wanted</li>
    <li> I didnt care for the glitter peraonal taste to thin of application</li>
    <li> Nor as much plus when I got it yhere was leak and sticky mail box now</li>
    <li> Gorgeous colors, work great with the light, the only thing is you don&#x27;t know what colors you will get, I was hoping for the bronze, aqua and black glitters, and instead I got three different kinds of pink! My clients like the pink but I was a little dissapointed. Other than not knowing what colors I was going to get I LOVE them! I will definitely order again. Make sure to keep them upright, they can leak and are very sticky.</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I wanted, love them so much. Gorgeous colors. My clients will love them!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time happy with my purchase will buy again. Love the colors</li>
    <li> items leak and dont dry fast enough under uv lite at all</li>
    <li> Not thrilled. Four of the exact same pink. The little pots are deceiving too; when you open them, there&#x27;s hardly any product in it. Maybe enough for two full sets.</li>
    <li> Not glitter powder like I thought.</li>
    <li> Got product on time. Did not get colors shown. Product works great.</li>
    <li> When I received the item I was expecting it to be a glitter gel like the title and picture show, but it wasn&#x27;t glitter gel at all, just solid colors of gel. When I tried to contact the seller asking how to return the item since there was no receipt with the package I got no response. I do not recommend this product!</li>
