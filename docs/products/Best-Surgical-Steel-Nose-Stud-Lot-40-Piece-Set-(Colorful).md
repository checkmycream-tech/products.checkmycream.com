<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT VERY MUCH PLEASED AND IS SATISFIED AS SOON AS I RECIEVED THEM I PUT ONE IN I AM WEARING ONE NOW :-)</li>
    <li> Colors are beautiful!!! I only gave 3 stars because the stone sits up too high (almost looks like i put a regular earring in my nose)...last nose studs i had sat perfectly on my nose.  Also, these nose studs will fall out very, very easily.  I have had my nose pierced for almost 20 years and I bought these for the red. I will probably never wear them as I don&#x27;t feel safe stud will stay in.  Disagree with another review that gauge is too thick, actually quite thin and ball does nothing to stop it from coming out. Next time I will pay the extra $. A nose ring stands out, should look nice and feel comfy...sadly the design is not so great.  Again color is wonderful, this is true.</li>
    <li> Came a week early,all studs were in the packaging and none were broken. Great just wish the diamond was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price!!! The perfect size studs!</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful and bright, just as shown in the photo. The package arrived before expected date.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Love them! Usually lose my nose studs when I am sleeping, I forgot to take it out these past two days, and it still stayed in!</li>
    <li> All of the nose studs came intact, and sooner than expected! They are the same as the ones I had been paying $12 for 6! They&#x27;re super easy to put in, and they fit like a 20g. But were still as easy to put in to my new piercing, as my other older, healed nose piercing! I highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> I love these little things! They are so cute, and being able to choose from a bunch of different colors makes putting in the nose ring exciting!&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this product is that the nose rings are very small, so you have to be careful not to sleep with them, or else they fall off and enter into a wrong hole in the body.</li>
    <li> love them, they came one month earlier than expected. They came in the perfect condition. The colours are just beautiful! x</li>
    <li> Love these! Fit perfectly. Can&#x27;t beat the price for 40 of them! If you lose one you got 39 to go!</li>
    <li> I totally love these nose rings ... I received them way before time . I will definitely be buying them again :-)</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just as described!</li>
    <li> In tge past I always lost my nose rings.  I decided to try these bwvayse of the price and the quantity.  You cannot beat that. I am very pleased with the size of the nose rings. I have plenty now. I lost 2 already because of my little one..I also wear one as ny second earring. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Okay I guess. Don&#x27;t use them much anymore because I changed to a hoop.</li>
    <li> They were delivered when they said I should expect them. So far so good for the price.</li>
    <li> The rings don&#x27;t cause any irritation.  That was one thing I was sketchy about when ordering them but they&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> I love them.  They fit well and do not irritate</li>
    <li> The studs are great, however I received only clear.</li>
    <li> These were also a gift and greatly appreciated. Love the colors and great wear.</li>
    <li> Nice color, right size, includes clear.</li>
    <li> This is awesome if you are looking for a medium size nose studs!</li>
    <li> These are great! the colors are a little lighter than expected, but not an inconvenience. the only reason it did not get 5 stars is because some of the gems are not centered, and look a little cheap. And they are a little longer than some of the other studs I&#x27;ve had, other than that I love these! and its so convenient to just put them back in the slot you got it from. I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought to be. Very small stones. Can hardly see them when wearing them.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Luv all the different. Colors.</li>
    <li> I was supposed to get different colors, but I got all of them that were the same color. All of them were silver. But they are good quality and all. They are perfect, I am just disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive the package I had asked for.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t think I will run out anytime soon, thanks</li>
    <li> I had to make this purchase.I would buy them at beauty suppy stores for $1.99 each.I usually washed them down the drain.So...I had to buy these!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have had them for a while now and out of all of them maybe two or three of the stones fell out.But sooooo what!!! The price is worth a few dropped stones.&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister and in the mail 8 came broken but other than that they are good! ❤️</li>
    <li> Best buy ever!  Saved me ton of money!</li>
    <li> Good product for the price! Very easy to take in and out and a very nice variety of colors. I&#x27;m actually fairly surprised by the fact that these are just as good of a quality as the ones I get from my local piercing store...and those are $20-40 EACH! Great deal, would certainly recommend. They are a little smaller than you may want though, but they still fit okay.</li>
    <li> Very good price for how many you get. Studs are small but that was okay with me.</li>
    <li> Love these so much!!! Such a great price</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Just the right size for me. I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Repeat purchase. Best deal for body jewelry!</li>
    <li> These colorful nose rings are beautiful.They fit great.Have a awesome too pretty shine.They are no trouble.There is lots of colors to pick from.I love them and their price I paid for them and the price was good.I am so very glad I purchased these nose rings!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Dainty! Awesome! Adds the perfect amount of sparkle! Small enough to wear anytime and anywhere!  Love love love them!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this, for about 3 dollars and some change. I received them on time, all 40 of them intact. They were great quality for the price, its been a few months I still have about twenty of them. Good for those who loose small things a lot.</li>
    <li> I have spent a lot of money in the past buying nose rings in malls which usually come in packs of 3 for about 10-15 dollars. They are of the exact same quality of these. I might have a lifetime supply with this pack. I have had them for about 3 months. I wanted them specifically for the dark blue color and I have been wearing the same one every time I wear blue. It has not tarnished or lost its stone.</li>
    <li> Nice colors and a tiny gauge. I was looking for a slightly larger gauge but these are good and stay tight to my nose and I haven&#x27;t lost one yet! I love matching my outfits!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re really small- way smaller than I expected. I love them anyways. They have really great colors and I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get them until June 16 to July 3 and I got them on June 4 so shipping is much faster than expected. In the picture I compare them to the width of the push pin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always losing my nose studs and having to replace them constantly was getting ridiculous. So for a few bucks you get 40 that should hopefully last me a while. Great price and arrived quicker then expected..</li>
    <li> I love them! At first I was like why do I need so many but then one got stuck on a towel (nothing wrong with the product) and i lost it. I was so happy to have so many ! :)</li>
    <li> Very nice! Small and brilliant. Great price and shipping</li>
    <li> These nose rings are perfect for the price! Although they are a bit smaller than other ones I have purchased, they look great, and I haven&#x27;t lost one yet. I love the plastic box they came in, and all of the ones I received were perfectly intact, no missing or broken gems. And so many different colors are great to match outfits or moods. Definitely recommend, unless you are looking for a bigger gauge ( these are a bit thinner than 20g)</li>
    <li> Its painful to put in and makes my nose red. It may be just me but after wearing this my nose hurts and turns red. To put it in you have to push hard till you bleed. The nose stud falls out a lot and pushing it in all the time gets annoying. Some of the studs are deformed other than that it could be worse. Only buy if you have a tough nose and are not pron to bleeding.</li>
    <li> Great product ! Arrived weeks earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I liked, although some of the studs were coming off. For the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I love these nose ring but I seem to loose them when I go to sleep at nite.. Not sure why..</li>
    <li> I ordered this and was pleased with the item. It&#x27;s exactly as described. The stones are small (which is nice). I would order these again if I needed some but there&#x27;s alot of these so I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll need any more anytime soon.</li>
    <li> great bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set and it came to me a month late. The studs are not as great and will most likely turn my skin green.</li>
    <li> they are exactly what I expected, plenty of each color in case I lose some.</li>
    <li> These are a great deal.  I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of the items, but at this  price I don&#x27;t expect then to be.  I got 40 nose studs for what I&#x27;d pay for one at the stores locally.  They are exactly what I wanted and true to what was advertised.  The shipping was ahead of schedule.  No problems or complaints.  I would buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Def worth the price will buy again if needed :) I ordered the mix colored and they look and fit just like I wanted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what more can be said.  I needed a lot of nose studs for cheap and that is what I got.  So far none of the crystals (or whatever they are) have fallen out, so that&#x27;s good.  Shipping to longer then I would like, but that was expected.</li>
    <li> choose this rating because the product is exactly what I I wanted, I love the different colors and  would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I got all 40. These are nose bones (with a little ball on the end that you have to push in so it stays put). THE BALLS ON THE END ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO PUT INTO YOUR NOSE. I was afraid that they would be way too big, but they are perfect sized. I give only 4 stars because only some of the balls were a little too big.</li>
    <li> Love these! all the different colors makes them fun and there easy to take out, so you can switch them out for the other colors. Also small so no one can really see them. The only two down sides are: if you wipe your face they&#x27;ll snag on something and come out your nose and you with not be able to see it if it falls on the floor. Other then that I have more of them and I love them.</li>
    <li> They are okay, for the price. I have no complaints. Other reviews are pretty much in line with my observations.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEEE THEMMM😍😍😍</li>
    <li> 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌💝💝💝💝💝❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍 I have the clear ones and these ones I love them bc they are amazing I lose them all the time&lt;br /&gt;So these are amazing SO MANY ❤️😍</li>
    <li> I did enjoy this. The only problem I had was that it was 22g instead of 20g, but it&#x27;s alright. I did like how they looked, and the colors are vibrant. I do like that there is 5 of each color just in case I lose one since they are very small. Very good price for the product. Shipping took less time than expected and I enjoyed this product. I would recommend it to anyone who just had their nose pierced since the 22g don&#x27;t hurt as much to put in as the 20g do.</li>
    <li> These things are awesome, I was hesitant because of the cheap price but I can&#x27;t believe they are the same thing I was getting at Claire&#x27;s for 3 for $15!  They must be 22G, the nub at the end is not painful at all, I barely feel it the nub in my piercing.  I normally wear 22G, 20G is a little uncomfortable for me.  I shoulda bought more than one set, I recommend them, Amazon&#x27;ers.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected. My ears are double pierced and the lower holes are gauged, so I needed something small and cheap to put in the top holes. They are really small gauges so I had to let my piercings close up a little so these don&#x27;t constantly fall out. I like the array of colors and when I lose them (I always do), it&#x27;s not a big deal because there is plenty more! So far they have not caused an allergic reaction, but I&#x27;ve only worn them for a few days.</li>
    <li> Love them . Many to choice from at a wonderful price. Stays in nose a doesn&#x27;t fall apart. Best ever purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product before, and loved it, so I ordered one for my friend...and she loved it as well.  I will def be purchasing a few more of these noserings.  They are perfect!</li>
    <li> Good for me.  I lose them constantly.  Cheap is best.</li>
    <li> These are really nice nose studs a couple were lose in there but that&#x27;s okay there&#x27;s a nice variety, perfect size, I love them!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I love how small the stud is</li>
    <li> I LOVE my nose rings! they fit perfectly, don&#x27;t hit the inside of my nose, no defects or anything, they came almost a month early, I have 8 different colors to be able to wear with different outfits, I&#x27;ve had them almost a month now and haven&#x27;t lost one in my sleep at all, (im accident prone to loosing them in my sleep lol) I would highly recommend them to anybody looking to buy in bulk instead of 3 for 10 dollars at any other store! I will definitely be shopping from these guys again!! :) Next I think ill get the all diamond studs!! The cheapest and best quality out of all and any nose rings I have ever bought! I won&#x27;t have to worry about buying anymore for a long time!!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it&#x27;d be but good quality &amp; such a great price!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these a couple years ago and just bought a 2nd set this week.  I like them but they are a bigger gauge than my last ones and bigger than the ones I normally wear so they hurt putting them in but I&#x27;m sure they will eventually fit.  On the plus side, they won&#x27;t easily fall out like my smaller gauged studs.  I would definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> good quality product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I bought this ones before and received quit quicktkly i rebought them again and havent received my purchase i actualy bought to sets and i am still waiting for them\. i loved them the first time i bought them but i havent received my second order with two sets of them</li>
    <li> I love these nose rings! I got my piercing in January and wanted a little bit of a variety so these came in handy!</li>
    <li> Some of the studs are off place but I guess it&#x27;s what you pay for ehh</li>
    <li> thumbs up for the price..</li>
    <li> l just recieved these a couple days ago and i love the variety of colors and the stud hasnt fallen out yet so they seem of good quaility. I definitely could not pass up the price!! Only thing i didnt like was it took a long time to arrive but got here a day before the actual day it was supposed to. All together im satified</li>
    <li> The gauge is too small and keeps falling out of my nose.</li>
    <li> No birds and cheap enough to lose! Cute colors too!</li>
    <li> Gems fall out WAY too easy</li>
    <li> Perfect size, and they&#x27;re easy to remove and clean without causing pain. The colors are bright as well very cute</li>
    <li> Just as listed, a little smaller gauge which I actually liked, shipped on time and packaged well.</li>
    <li> they came very quickly and they are gorgeous &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Not good stones not straight</li>
    <li> My wife enjoyed them very much, seem to fit and look very nice.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with product. It meets greatest expectations</li>
    <li> I received these sooner than told and they are awesome! They have a small ball in the end to help hold them in and the jewels stay in really well. I have had the same one in since I received them 5 weeks ago and its still holding up well. I would have rated 5 stars except for I ordered the mixed colors package and received all in the same white colors. Still love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a wild sleeper and surprisingly, I&#x27;ve not lost one of these studs yet. While these are small, I&#x27;m still able to find them either in my bed or nearby on the floor. Even if I couldn&#x27;t find them immediately, I could simply replace them with another because so many come in the tray. I have had a couple of the gems to fall out but I was expecting that so no big deal.</li>
    <li> Good item very conventiant. It was quick and fast very friendly also I really wouldn&#x27;t wanna go anywhere else very happy with the nose rings :)</li>
    <li> These are very cheap made along with the fact there are all different sizes will never order again. The balls at end of post are different sizes as well. Seems no body jewelry off here is worth buying took over a month th recieved well</li>
    <li> The best nose studs I have found on here yet. Great</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great just what I was looking for a bunch of quality nose studs for cheap it&#x27;s the perfect purchase</li>
    <li> cant beat the price and the quality is amazing! Especially because nose rings are so easy to lose.</li>
    <li> ok but not great you get what you pay</li>
    <li> Love love love these! These are the only nose studs I wear now. If your stud falls out  and you lose it a lot I&#x27;d recommend this because it&#x27;s cheap for a lot of them in for great quality. I recommended this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and I am very satisfied with my purchase! A must have if you&#x27;ve got your nose pierced!</li>
    <li> Great price&amp; quantity! Takes a little while to arrive, but worth the wait! It&#x27;s better to order these, rather than pay $1 or $2 for a single stud.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved these I actually use them for my Tragus because you can use them vice versa as for the nose rings they were perfect for my ear</li>
    <li> Nice tiny size doe my nose piercings. Many colors to choose from. Stay in ok, the ball at the end ismt very big. Every so often one comes out (if my nose gets bumped) but so many that I can easily replace.</li>
    <li> Love them! They are comfy not to big and arejust right.  They sit nicely even though my face isn&#x27;t doing justice. It was worth the money and I have a place to store my other ones! Thanks again</li>
    <li> Did not fit.. Wasn&#x27;t long enough.. I did not like how they felt. Thats all.. Just how I&#x27;m feeling. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the best deal on nose rings I&#x27;ve found. I got this for a gift awhile ago, and the person has only lost two rings the whole time they&#x27;ve had it. They stay in really well; a lot better than any other rings used.</li>
    <li> My best friend loves them.  😊</li>
    <li> I got these because I always lose my nose studs. I was so surprised at how fast they came, and the packaging. I love these, the only thing that concerns me is the sheer size of these. They are soo small. xD Other than they they are good! :D</li>
    <li> Came in early. But gauge was way to small. Not with it.</li>
    <li> Took a while to come but im very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> Love the assortment and colors!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great deal, good quality. No complaints!</li>
    <li> The package came much much earlier that was expected so that was super exciting. But unfortunately what I didn&#x27;t know when ordering was there was a bump on the end ( to keep the stud from falling out). This made the studs to big to even get in my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to return. I don&#x27;t see the point since they were only four dollars to begin with. I&#x27;m going to clean off the two I tried on and give to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would buy from here again.</li>
    <li> Great quality nose rings. I like the case they came in. Very excited to use. Glad to have a lot as back up or for different colors. Fit perfectly and is very comfortable. Does not come out easy at all despite that they are studs. Colors really stand out when you wear them.</li>
    <li> Awful! If I could give it NO stars I would. Not only are they tiny, but they are of cheap material!  But I guess what can you expect for the price? Now I&#x27;m stuck with 40 useless cheap studs.</li>
    <li> Great price for nose studs and the shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> defiantly worth the money</li>
    <li> Love them! &amp; came in sooner then it was suppose to!</li>
    <li> Awesome. I usually pay more for just one of these in stores</li>
    <li> Generally good, and inexpensive. However, it tends to stick out a bit (unlike flatter studs), and I need to adjust it often (nudging it inwards).</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking they would be average gauge, since I could not find anywhere on there that said the size. I was very disappointed. Normally I wear between an 18 and a 20g. I couldn&#x27;t even wear them. They would not stay in because of how small they were. I gave it two stars because other than that the studs were exactly as expected. Vibrant colors and received on time.</li>
    <li> not as long as i needed them but wonderful and lots of them and came a week early :)</li>
    <li> Some of the stones are not glued correctly. Otherwise great for price</li>
    <li> it took over a month to get to get to me but that was expected they came within the time frame i was told, once i got the package they were smaller than i thought they were in the picture but i bought for the wife for Christmas and she said they work and she put them in and it looks good!</li>
    <li> Purchased these three weeks ago and according to the estimated delivery date I may have to wait two more.....really hoping these earrings  are worth the wait</li>
    <li> Love these! They&#x27;re tiny gauge size with bright gems, I&#x27;m a teenager so they&#x27;re  perfect for me! The posts are a bit long, but that&#x27;s completely fine as long as you don&#x27;t have an extremely narrow nostril. Also, the gems are very well placed, I suggest these for any person with their nose pierced! They&#x27;re perfect for any occasion because of all the color choices!</li>
    <li> They are beautiful and small i just wish they were longer or my nose is to thick</li>
