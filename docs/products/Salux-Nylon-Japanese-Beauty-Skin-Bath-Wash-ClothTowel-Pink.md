      <li>Good to be able to order them on Amazon</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Hands down the BEST tool for exfoliation!  Do not hesitate to buy.</li>
    <li> This washcloth is my favorite! I don&#x27;t want to be without one. Soft, but abrasive enough to get off dead skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Save some money and go buy one of those plastic kitchen scrubbers for pots and pans. Awful. Too rough and cheap.</li>
    <li> Lathers up and rinses clean easily.  Just the right size for my back.  Took a star off because it is scratchy, but not too much for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a sale but I also use these- everyone should have them WOW!!!!! Love them! Great sale too!</li>
    <li> I bought this product back in January to use at college but when I moved home for the summer, I accidentally left it behind but I&#x27;m so ordering another one! I love this because it&#x27;s sanitary and dries in a couple of hours, it&#x27;s a cute pink color that satisfies my girlish taste, it fits well in my shower caddy, it can be bunched up or let out to wash every inch of your body, and it&#x27;s also supposed to be a great exfoliator. It says that it&#x27;s quite abrasive but I don&#x27;t find it uncomfortable at all and prefer it to the feel of other washcloths. I feel more clean while using this. As for the exfoliation, I can&#x27;t be 100% sure if it&#x27;s a miracle worker because before, I was hoping it would help me with some of my minor skin problems such as tinea versicolor, keratosis pilaris, and some skin discoloration and I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in that respect but maybe if I apply some natural products after I&#x27;m done washing, it would probably help some more since I heard that skin products/oils when they&#x27;re freshly exfoliated. Excited to use this washcloth again, I really missed using it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing wash cloth-towel-thing! As another reviewer suggested, I bunch it up like a shower puff, put my soap on it to get all sudsy, and then wash all the easy to reach places. Then, I un-scrunch to full towel length to get my back. It works better than any other back-sponge thing ever has! I have rather sensitive skin and was concerned about it being too harsh, but it&#x27;s just the right amount of exfoliation. As an experiment, I tried it on part of my face... don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited to do the review until it&#x27;s been through the wash a few times to see how it held up, and after 2 months, so far so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is to make sure you get the real thing and send it back if it&#x27;s a knock-off. I got mine from GoldenLeaf (though I&#x27;m sure other sellers have the real deal as well). Per another reviewer&#x27;s comments, I checked to make sure it had a tag with the SALUX logo, material content (60% nylon 40% polyester) and country of origin (Japan) to make sure it was legit.</li>
    <li> It took me ages to get this cloth! I ordered from ToysNGamesEtc and FAT CUPID, but they both sent me knock-offs. I finally received a genuine Salux cloth from CP Cosmetics and I&#x27;m in love with it. It lathers very well and exfoliates like none other--I&#x27;ll never have to use a salt scrub again. It made my legs so smooth, I didn&#x27;t feel like the razor was \\&quot;dragging\\&quot; on my skin anymore. After showering, I roll it up in my bath towel (the cloth is a bit difficult to fully wring out) and it&#x27;s instantly near-dry. Love it!</li>
    <li> Washing with a bar of soap alone always leaves me feeling a bit grimy. No matter how much I rinse, it doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate dead skin cells, etc. A mesh pouf is ok for exfoliating but 1) you can&#x27;t scrub your back 2) They fall apart WAY too easily 3) to get a good scrub (as opposed to just lathering your body) you have to hold the pouf in a tight bundle and rub it against your skin 4) it&#x27;s not really good for scrubbing your face.    I came across this washcloth when I was buying a showerhead, it was one of those \\&quot;people who bought this, also bought that\\&quot; kind of ads. Seeing 4+ star reviews despite hundreds of reviews, it sounded like it was worth checking out. So I clicked, I read, I was still confused. \\&quot;It&#x27;s just a nylon cloth,\\&quot; I thought, \\&quot;right?\\&quot; It claimed to have won some kind of invention award but didn&#x27;t say what award and that made me suspicious. Anyway, I ordered it since it was cheap and if it did what it claimed it would be worth it.    THIS THING WAY EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. As hard as it was for me to understand the other reviews, it will be hard for me to explain but I&#x27;ll try... It&#x27;s great at exfoliating but not abrasive (won&#x27;t leave your skin red and raw like a cloth washcloth). It&#x27;s long enough to soap up and get your back (probably the first time since I was a kid that I had a good back scrub in a strictly bathing situation). It won&#x27;t fall apart like a pouf. It&#x27;s a lot easier to rinse and get the soap out than a pouf so you won&#x27;t get bacteria. It doesn&#x27;t hold water when rinsed like a cloth so you won&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry--in other words, it&#x27;s good to go if your hubby or someone else wants to shower right after you. Finally: It&#x27;s great for your face--gentle but effective. Your face will feel SQUEAKY CLEAN after you&#x27;re done. All the makeup, blackheads, whiteheads, skin bumps, and dead skin will be washed away but you won&#x27;t be sore or re-faced. I SWEAR you will be feeling your skin after you&#x27;re done the first time using it saying, \\&quot;wow, that&#x27;s so smooth!\\&quot;    Are you getting the idea? I don&#x27;t know if this REALLY won an invention award but it should have. This is a must have for anyone who showers, woman or man (my boyfriend loves it too).</li>
    <li> Im 48 yrs old and have been using this salux scrub clothes for over 20 yrs, and will NEVER use a ordinary wash clothes again, I feel super clean with  this and my skin Looks gauranteed Healthier in appearances, I even use the new gray extra coarse scrub clothes from salux!!! this one is fantastic too !!! and Im a female!!!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend (now wife) introduced this to me twenty-five years ago, and I&#x27;ve never gone back to your soft plush little cloth squares by \\&quot;Cannon\\&quot; and the like.    This is a long rectangle of coarse plastic - sounds bad, right?    But the cloth has amazing properties:  You don&#x27;t need a lot of soap or water to fill it sufficiently to wash your whole body, rinsing it is quick, thorough and easy, it&#x27;s coarse (not painful) texture and long length are perfect for scrubbing your back and any extremity, and it&#x27;s very thin fabric structure dries extremely fast.    Unlike Western washcloths that require tons of soap and water to feel ready to scrub with and take forever to rinse the soap out of and dry, the Salux feels efficient in terms of the amount of soap and water consumed and can be used, wrung out and packed up almost immediately.    Though I am ordering several, they take years to wear out but I&#x27;m always afraid of not being able to find one when I need it, and would never use any other product.</li>
    <li> The Good: This product is an awesome one that needs to be sold here in the U.S. It&#x27;s a great alternative to the brush/loofah. It&#x27;s like a combination of both! I am satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: Only complaint is that it is really tough, but it&#x27;s great for washing the back.&lt;br /&gt;And the Random: So gonna get green or something next time, since pink is too girly.</li>
    <li> After just one use I noticed the difference in my skin.  I used to have acne on my back and chest, and this washcloth has irradicated the problem.  I would strongly recommend this as an excellent way to exfoliate the entire body.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and received the cheap imitation \\&quot;LeiYiJie\\&quot; brand cloth, which doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to the authentic one. Be careful when you order this - I hate to give a low star rating to a good product, but this seller doesn&#x27;t seem to consistently ship the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;The other color Salux cloths available on Amazon also have other people complaining about this switch-out, but this listing didn&#x27;t so I thought I might be safer in receiving the wrong thing. I was wrong! So I&#x27;m adding this review to warn potential buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - you can&#x27;t return this thing because of sanitation issues. You have to contact Amazon directly if you receive the fake, and they will take care of you. But if you don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle, do yourself a favor and buy from a more reputable seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT (July 5, 2011):&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to include the name of the seller who supplied the imitation to me: SCS Collectibles, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon goes through different providers, so I can&#x27;t comment on the current seller&#x27;s reputation for this product.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this product. It is wonderful for those of us that live in a cold climate as skin can get dry and flakey. This allows skin along with the perfect lotion makes skin soft and not itchy. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Salux is the original nylon Japanese cloth it does what everyone claims , leaves your skin glowing I find it much easier to use the cloth then other type of bath wash exfoliate . I made the mistake of purchasing other clothes without knowing there are plenty of imitators . Go with the Original Salux Nylon you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my beauty secret. I first found these when I lived in Japan 20 years ago. They are perfect and keep my skin smooth and polished</li>
    <li> I have heard about this product on makeupalley, and because there was such a big hype about it, I went to Amazon and got one to see how it works out myself. Turns out, this thing is really thin, is made up of some scratchy like material, and even is rough when you add soap to lather it on, but I say it is a good product to buy overall. I&#x27;m not used to the fact that it is so scratchy like, but I hope like other women, that I would eventually get use to it. I wouldn&#x27;t ever use it on my face though cause it may cause scarring, and even if you don&#x27;t see it right away, it may eventually become deep wrinkles and make the skin ugly! I say this product is a must buy for many women, plus to me, its not expensive at all!</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice so far but like it a lot.  At first glance, I said I may have to use a whole lotta soap to make this sud, but not true at all.  It suds very easily.  It&#x27;s also bigger than expected but also washes out easily.  I get ingrowns on the side on my calf (I know that is weird) and I use it to take off the dead skin and it actually leaves my entire body very soft and smooth.  It is harsh though!! You have to rub it against your skin to your own liking.  I recommend it, plus it&#x27;s extremely affordable.</li>
    <li> I only purchased this product because I needed a total order at least $25 worth of items to get free shipping, and I was short a couple of dollars. As it turned out, this washcloth is now my favorite, and I plan on ordering more but in different colors. I love the long length which is good for washing all parts of your back. The nylon cloth creates lots of later, rinses easily, dries quickly, is rough enough to exfoliate skin, but is soft enough for tender parts. I&#x27;ve never felt so clean!</li>
    <li> This washcloth is the best, period. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years and I have never switched to any other. It scrubs very well and you can always see the dirt wash off while you&#x27;re in the shower. Because of it&#x27;s considerable length, i can always hold the ends with both hands and use the wash cloth to scrub my neck and back in a left-to-right motion. My family members love it too. This product is highly recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a firm sponge/washcloth that lasts long and scrubs extremely well.</li>
    <li> I may never buy a different scrub object again. This is amazing! And I feel so clean without my skin feeling raw. I have sensitive skin, and even with rather vigorous scrubbing, I didn&#x27;t feel raw. Amazing!! Plus I&#x27;m saving so much soap. It only takes the one lathering and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m telling you... this scratchy towel will change the way you shower and the way you feel when you get into your 800 thread-count sheets. I use this bad-boy and my female companion says stuff like \\&quot;your skin is as smooth as mine\\&quot;. So anyways, what I&#x27;m saying is this thing is more valuable than its $5 price tag suggests.    DO NOT BUY A KNOCK-OFF imitation -- this thing is brilliant because the abrasive threads are not structurally tied to the towel. With a knock-off scratchy towel as you stretch the towel you reduce the abrasiveness of the towel. That&#x27;s a killer.</li>
    <li> Item came fast and this is really the best scrubber out there. I don&#x27;t feel like I really showered unless I use this every time I wash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for months. It feels good to use especially for drier skin types but I don&#x27;t think it improves skin quality.</li>
    <li> i highly recommend this exfoliating cloth to everyone, for all skin types and skin needs. Works for a good gentle cleansing or if you really need to get down to business this is the perfect tool for deep exfoliation.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect washcloth, long enough to scrub your back and textured for exfoliation, I&#x27;ll never use an ordinary cloth again.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews on make- up ally.  These are far better than bath poufs.  They actually exfoliate.  They are long enough to scrub your back without any crazy moves.  You can also throw them in the wash to keep them clean.  These are a must have.  Make sure you get the Salux ones, there are cheaper versions out of there but they are not the same</li>
    <li> I love these shower scrubbers!  It&#x27;s especially wonderful to be able to reach one&#x27;s back!  The soap lathers up really well on them and then they rinse off completely, so they are very hygenic:  no mold or mildew.  I&#x27;ll never buy a loofah or a bath brush again.  Now I am ordering more for my friends!</li>
    <li> Order this product directly from the company, TrueRenu. Amazon screwed up my order and charged a HUGE shipping and handling fee. I canceled my order with Amazon and ordered directly from TrueRenu and am a very happy customer. TrueRenu provides excellent customer service and has a fantastic product line. The bath cloth does an exceptional job of cleansing tough-to-reach places like my back and leaves me with great, smooth. blemish-free skin. I have no affiliation with TrueRenu other than being a satisfied customer. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is a great way to scrub your skin. Funny thing is, it&#x27;s made out of synthetic stuff, a 60/40 nylon/polyester blend. I&#x27;m usually Mr. Natural and Organic kinda guy, but this cloth is an exception. It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, and it get you REALLY clean. It&#x27;s kind of huge, I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say they cut them in pieces, but I like the long cloth for back scrubbing. They dry fast too, and it is easy to rinse..If you&#x27;re looking for a washing cloth, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Wasn&#x27;t sure about the pink and I&#x27;m usually one to use a hemp product but this works. My lotion lathered like crazy and I could get my back done without a brush, which I don&#x27;t like. It rinses easily, dries fast and gets the job done. Handy little thing. Get one, they are inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Great little item; very handy for washing your back especially the middle part where your hands just cannot reach. The Salux is a long piece of scrubby nylon. It doesn&#x27;t not stretch. Make sure you buy this brand if that is what you want. There are other brands that are shorter but that stretch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used those round textured body scrubs in the past,  but this works much better.  I like to use this in place of a washrag.  You put soap on it; work it into a nice lather and scrub yourself - head to toe!.  It is quite long so you can work it to also clean your back.  After your shower/bath your skin feels baby soft and smooth.  Removes all the dead skin cells....</li>
    <li> I first used one of these while visiting a friend in Mexico ten years ago. They gave me one as a parting gift. Now I keep extra ones around because every women who uses my shower wants to take mine home.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of these since my Korean roommate introduced them to me. Keeps ingrown hairs and blemishes at bay!</li>
    <li> The Salux long lasting wash cloth makes it a joy to shower.  With one squirt of soap the cloth makes billowing suds and the texture of the cloth helps exfoliate your skin.  They feel good and are also fast drying.  We have been using these cloths for several years and keep buying new ones to give as gifts to friends.</li>
    <li> Product lathers well and is similar in scrubbing capacity to the Loofah.  It is make of a nylon netting material and the product is quite long so it can be used for scrubbing the back.  I cut mine into two smaller pieces.  They were still big enough to get hard to reach back spots.  I think this product will be good for travel because it dries so quickly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an abrasive plastic wash cloth. Nothing special about it honestly.</li>
    <li> A little rougher than I thought it would be. Definitely not a net puff. To be used very carefully and gently.</li>
    <li> A complete bathing product.  This thing isn&#x27;t \\&quot;soft\\&quot;... quite the opposite.  It cleans better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  If you shower alone (poor person...) they are great for scrubbing your back- much better than a brush.  They&#x27;re difficult to find, too, but worth the search... We had purchased ours nearly 15 years ago and they had finally worn out with daily use.  Oh, and they come in several colors so don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;pink\\&quot; deter you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this thing for a couple of weeks. While it&#x27;s not the most amazing thing ever, my skin does feel smoother, especially on my upper arms and thighs where I tend to have bumps and redness from KP. As a shorty, the downside is that it&#x27;s almost too long, great for reaching my back but bunchy and awkward for everywhere else. It gives a good scrub without being too scratchy.</li>
    <li> i purchase a lot of stuff on amazon but this is definitely one of the best. my skin is amazingly soft. use this with a moisturizing body wash and you wont regret it!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
    <li> I love this, like a loofa you can use everywhere, glad I got three! Gave one to a friend I was so pleased</li>
    <li> this is scratchy and slightly painful on your skin, but the other reviewers are right about how buttery soft your skin will be. its long so you can do that shimmy thing on your backside, and rough enough that you really feel the scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its also very cheap so i didnt mind trying it out. also, made of plastic so no porous bacteria filled eww-ness. but its so cheap that if you do toss it its only like 5bucks to replace. and in  so many colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in short: this is great and cheap and slightly painful..but the pain is worth the great glowy buttery skin you achieve. i use dove deep moisture and the target version of aveeno&#x27;s oatmeal soothing skin relief body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps:)</li>
    <li> I purchased my authentic Salux from Emma&#x27;s Cosmetics and it&#x27;s very nice - long enough to get my back or to scrunch up and use like a pouf, and gentle enough that I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to take off my epidermis.  I need more for the other members of my family because I&#x27;m not sharing!</li>
    <li> I was already using the little Korean scrub washcloths as a step up from regular washcloths and thought there couldn&#x27;t be anything more effective than those.  But this thing is awesome.  I feel sooooo clean. The scrub is powerful but not to the point of uncomfortableness.  There is an underlying softness to it that lets you scrub as hard as you want without worry.  The first time I used this, my grandmother was up from Florida and said it looked like my skin was a few shades lighter.  I noticed this myself looking at my legs and ankles.  After using for several months, the girl who waxes my legs commented on how much softer and smoother my skin was.  I&#x27;m surprised at how effective and pleasant feeling it is.  I defy you to not moan in pleasure the first time you try it. I&#x27;ve always looked forward to bathing but this addition to my routine takes showering to another level. I cannot wait to share this little gem with my friends and family.  Get one, You will never look back.</li>
    <li> Very good alternative to traditional wash cloths. Initially it felt a little rough on the skin, but after a few showers my skin adapted and it felt nice on my body.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST for exfoliating/showering. Makes your skin sooo soft. My boyfriend is constantly commenting on how soft and smooth my skin is. And the size and shape makes scrubbing your back really easy. I will continue to purchase these through Amazon (cheaper than the Salux website).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I actually relieved a real Salux cloth. It was fraying on the sides within a month. I didn&#x27;t feel like it was exfoliating enough on my skin either. The one I had before was much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this type of wash cloth for about 10 years and I love them. I decided to try these cloths because of the reviews and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before. I will continue to order them and use them for a long time to come. The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely. (I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
    <li> Due to spine surgery I cannot bend or twist, which in the shower to clean my whole body I would need to do just that.  This wash cloth is super long so I can wash all over me (including my back) with no problems at all.  It is very sand paper like in it&#x27;s roughness, but it is almost addictive because you know it is exfoliating all your dead skin cells.  If you want something soft, do not purchase this!</li>
    <li> I love this exfoliating cloth! It seemed rough and scratchy at first, but now I&#x27;m used to it. It makes my skin so smooth. I only use it on my body -- it would be way too rough for your face.</li>
    <li> Love these towels. Excellent quality. First bought in korea in 90&#x27;. Never went back to regular exfoliators, or towels since.</li>
    <li> These sponges are wonderful.  You can wash your own back thorougly and without having to twist or stretch.  They have enough texture to exfoliate and they make great gifts.</li>
    <li> Love these things. Order one !</li>
    <li> When I ordered this it said \\&quot;Ships from and sold by LUCCA\\&quot;.  Now the vendor is a different name.  This is the page that my order links to.  LUCCA sent me KNOCKOFFS.  Others have had this same problem.  As other reviewers with knockoffs have said, the ones I received do not have a tag with the SALUX logo, material content (60% nylon 40% polyester) and country of origin (Japan) to make sure it was legit.  Mine were also wrapped in tissue paper and not in real packaging.  I&#x27;d like to order the real thing but I do not know how to tell if I am ordering from a reputable seller.  So mad.</li>
    <li> most effective at softening skin.  after a month, no more orange peel skin.  goodbye smelly loofah; so-long expensive alpha hydroxy; good riddance cold skin brush!</li>
    <li> I was expecting a wash cloth size product, maybe it was my fault for not reading the dimensions. The edges were not finished so I cut to the size I desired. Wasn&#x27;t worth it to return</li>
    <li> I love using this when I want a bit more exfoliation for my skin. The cloth is very rectangular, and can be used to scrub the back while holding both ends of the towel. Good for feet and knees.</li>
    <li> I use like a loohah in shower good for back shoulders toes heels use with soap gets dead skin off. Need to us gently</li>
    <li> I bought this but it didn&#x27;t exfoliate my skin like everyone stated it did for them. Then again I&#x27;m used to exfoliating regularly so maybe that&#x27;s my problem. However, it was great on my face. My pores are no longer clogged and skin looks bright and glowing. Very happy about that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Salux washcloths for 30 years and don&#x27;t want to imagine showers without them.  They have just the right amount of \\&quot;scrubbiness\\&quot; for the entire body to feel clean and exfoliated. If you&#x27;re accustomed to cotton washcloths, you will love how little bar or liquid soap you need to get a good bubbly lather. Easy rinsing and super-quick drying: just shake out excess water and roll in a towel...ready to pack for easy travel!  They last years with daily use and when they do eventually start to get a little stiff and frayed, they make PERFECT dish scrubbers! They are so large they can even be cut in half with scissors to make them last even longer.  Salux makes an appreciated, low-cost gift especially for travelers.  ENTHUSIASTICALLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> Shipped exactly as described. Salux cloth arrived within days in the same packaging advertised online. The towel is much longer than expected, so that was a nice surprise. The towel works so well to exfoliate and makes my skin feel so incredibly soft! Dries quickly and is made of great quality materials.</li>
    <li> This is so great for exfoliating your back! It really lathers up your soap to make a little go a long way. It is nice and rough and makes it easy to reach hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> Love these wash cloths. I have used these for years and cannot find them easily. Good to be able to order them on Amazon</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, but now I can&#x27;t live without my Salux. This thing destroys my eczema flareups, and my scabby knees and dry elbows have NEVER been so smooth. Even time I step out of the shower, I feel like I have shed an entire layer of my skin: you feel so incredibly fresh and clean. Do yourself a favour and try this. You have nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> I love this bath towel! It exfoliates really well and it&#x27;s long enough so that I can exfoliate my back. I think to see best results of dead skin removal from this product you should stand under your hot water(as hot as you can bear) for 10-15 minutes then, without soap, rub the cloth across your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like it will last me a really long time as I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it&#x27;s still in mint condition. Unlike a loofah it dries really quickly and I am able to wash out all the soap from the towel.&lt;br /&gt;And it makes my skin feel so soft and it is helping to clear my complexion of unevenness because it optimizes the ability of the ingredients in the soaps I use that contain papaya and kojic acid.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend~</li>
    <li> My favorite scrub for the past 20 years! My family and I have been using this as long as I can remember. It&#x27;s more abrasive than the American products, which I like. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love the Bath washes.......The Resinol  ointment  has changed...?  ??  Did mot receive&amp;#34;&amp;#34; Perfect Storm&amp;#34;&amp;#34;  DON&#x27;T WANT IT NOW....HEARD IT WAS ABOUT A SMALL BOAT....I WAS ON A CRUISE IN THAT STORM.............</li>
    <li> Great product. I can now reach my back really well and it is easy to use and foams up my soap a lot. Love it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical yet willing to try this cloth and it&#x27;s amazing!  I absolutely love it.  Just a little bit of soap it lathers it up really well and stays that way (unless of course you add too much water, in which case it rinses really easily, which is awesome too!).  It&#x27;s gently abrasive which means it exfoliates really nicely.  Also, given it&#x27;s size it&#x27;s so perfect for exfoliating the back.  So glad I decided to try it!</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well, not sure it lives up to the hype</li>
    <li> Good scrub. Wears out quickly though.</li>
    <li> These are really great for an all around good scrub of the body and they last long and very easy to clean before getting out of the shower, just hang in the shower to dry.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant, but excited to try this and the price made it an easy decision. I LOVE IT! It has been the only product I&#x27;ve used to fully exfoliate my rough elbows. Not only that, but I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my thighs, mainly how firm they feel, not to mention a reduced appearance of cellulite. I&#x27;ve been hoping that it will help reduce my dreaded adult acne, and while it has definitely smoothed out my skin, I still have to commit to my acne creams. Overall, I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I like it, everytime I took a shower and after using it. My skin feels good, relax and very clean.</li>
    <li> I first discovered Salux Japanese washing clothes 13 years ago in the only Japanese Market in Salt Lake City, Utah, I&#x27;ve used nothing but them since that time and introduce them to countless others who have discovered an easy way to keep your skin healthy and glowing it&#x27;s Salux. It&#x27;s no wonder they won the award for the best Japanese Invention.</li>
    <li> amazing.  Skin never felt better.  Less ingrowns now as well.</li>
    <li> I bought a Salux cloth after reading the many reviews on Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised when opened the package. These things are HUGE. And when used, they&#x27;re so much more cost effective and less messy than all the exfoliating scrubs and washes and whatever else I was using before. They make your skin noticeably softer and smoother. These can even be used, without irritation, on your face as an exfoliant, as well as your feet (it helped my feet soften and made my face more smooth~). They dry very quickly, improve your skin quality, give such a clean feeling, are light and are so affordable. I have converted haha! One thing to note is that you might need a bit of time to get used to the scrubbing, but otherwise it&#x27;s pretty much the perfect exfoliating towel. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Two years ago, I bought this cloth (in turquoise) and have loved it ever since. With daily use for two whole years and then some, it FINALLY began to wear out so naturally I got another, this time in pink, and I am not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have not discovered this cloth yet, it&#x27;s a long nylon scrubby cloth that really does what it says. It helps your soap lather up so you don&#x27;t have to use as much, it dries very quickly which helps when I take it on trips with me and it&#x27;s very durable, but gentle enough that I can use it on my face and body and it helps keep my skin smooth. I&#x27;ll keep using these until they stop making them...which is hope is never.</li>
    <li> Good quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> Salux bath cloths are the best. They exfoliate but are not too rough.  I bring them everywhere with me.  I do not feel clean unless I use one. I use to buy them from Asian Grocery Stores, but have not been able to locate them recently.  Finding them on Amazon was a real life saver.</li>
    <li> I think that these are the best wash cloths in the world. I will continue to buy these as long as they are available. They gently exfoliate your skin and leave it soft and glowing. I do home waxing, and I love that these cloths are able to get the wax off, yet are gentle enough that they don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I bought some for my girlfriends and my mother and they are love them as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there is so much hype about a cheap piece of rough nylon cloth.  Yes, I&#x27;m talking about the authentic Salux nylon, made in Japan, not some imitation some here have complained about.  I bought this based on all the rave reviews only to find out it&#x27;s no more than a piece of cheaply made nylon that gave me dermatitis, especially on my hands.  No matter how gentle and careful I was when using it, it always made palms of my hands red, raw, dry and incredibly itchy like nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a imitation product would have worked better. I suspect a lot of positive reviews are fake.  Do no buy this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE This Bath Cloth. If you love a good bath, this will only make it better! I bought this based on the reviews; I knew nothing about it prior to reading it on Amazon.com, you gus were right on the money. I am buying one for everyone I know. LOVE LOVE LOVE this bath cloth!!</li>
    <li> I ordered two Salux bath scrubs from two different companies. The one I ordered from the company Fat Cupid was a knock-off version. I know because the other one I ordered came in the plastic Salux packaging. This one, though, came wrapped in tissue paper and the material was clearly of lower quality. The real Salux scrub fabric didn&#x27;t stretch when I pulled on it, but on the fake one stretched and didn&#x27;t contract, and when I stretched it made that sort of ripping noise like old elastic does when you stretch it and it doesn&#x27;t contract. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one is because I sent the company an email about it and they responded promptly, refunded my money, and I didn&#x27;t have to return it, so I basically got it for free.</li>
    <li> This is definitely weird when you first use it as it definitely feels more &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; than the loofahs I&#x27;m so used to, but persistence pays off. After use my skin feels SO ridiculously soft and smooth and I can see &amp; feel the results from the exfoliating texture. I had some rough skin on my back before using this but due to it&#x27;s versatile shape I was not only able to reach it easily but it gently exfoliated off the dead skin, so after only two washes my back was silky smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very travel friendly and I&#x27;ve brought it with me on trips, it packs very nicely. This is super efficient and you really FEEL clean and scrubbed when you use this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this sponge everyday. Probably 2 times a week. Gets me clean head-toe. Would advise using on the face. It&#x27;s super long and reaches my back very nice. I dispose my body sponges every month so knowing that this is made with nylon material (I think) means less chances of germs getting stuck on it.</li>
    <li> Though it is little on the rougher side, this is one of the best scrubs that I have ever used in my life.</li>
    <li> This is the best beauty product for the body ever made. I give one to everyone I know as gifts and in their Christmas stockings. Every person who try&#x27;s it cannot believe how clean and smooth their skin is. I cannot rave enough about this simple yet effective little product!</li>
    <li> I bought the Olay Pro-X Cleansing system and I swear this does the same thing but better.  It&#x27;s cheap, dries quickly, and is holding up well after a few months.  I am able to use it on by body and face.</li>
    <li> Love this. It&#x27;s been a while since I used it though because it lost it&#x27;s roughness. I&#x27;ll def purchase a new one soon. It really felt like it was exfoliating my skin good. I like that&#x27;s it&#x27;s long like a scarf. Very cool to bathe with :)</li>
    <li> love this!! make sure its original. i am ordering more in every color for everyone in my house.</li>
    <li> It came on time and exactly what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;I wished it came in different color. I will try to order more in future</li>
    <li> I bought this bath cloth after my first trip to a Korean bath house. I was really impressed by how much dead skin they were able to remove with their mits during my scrub treatment. This towel works very similarly!</li>
    <li> This is a very good gift as well as personal use.  Highly recommend it to everyone.  It is good for your skin.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this towel. It can feel a bit rough at first but it&#x27;s excellent at exfoliating your skin. After the first use, my skin felt so buttery soft and smooth. It really helps give you a really clean feeling, it&#x27;s refreshing. Had this towel for roughly 2 months and still works great. Best to use while showering, helps to scrub every nook and cranny, making sure your mid back is clean and exfoliated has never been so easy! ^_^ I also use this towel to help exfoliate my face once or twice a week! always makes my face seem brighter and refreshed. It lathers soap really well, it&#x27;s made so it doesn&#x27;t really hold water so be careful to hold out of direct streams of water while you suds up. It rinses clean with ease and dries very quickly so you don&#x27;t have to worrying about it molding up or smelling sour. If you&#x27;re worried about bacteria running under some hotter than humanly comfortable water should do the trick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bit awkward to use at first couple times but then you get the hang of it. The texture of it is like a shower sponge but a little bit thicker. You defiantly feel it scrubbing away and cleaning off any part of your body. I like to use it with body wash and only need a little bit of product. When done it dries super fast  too.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these. I bought this for my Mother. We both love love love these. The Salux is very good and worth every penny I paid. It pays for itself in no time.</li>
    <li> this is a good cloth for defolating  the skin. It is at a very good prize and it is easy to clean!</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is the only bath towel I&#x27;ve been using for the past 6 years. It&#x27;s durable and light, but at the same time it exfoliates. I never had a problem with it getting mildew/dull, but I only have to replace it once a year. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE using this thing. I much prefer it to the regular loofa sponges that fall apart and don&#x27;t make me feel clean. This thing is awesome, I will never go back. It&#x27;s not for people who aren&#x27;t into slightly abrasive sponges/cloths but for those of us who love a good scrub this is perfect.</li>
    <li> all I can  say about this  product is they are totally awesome I introduced my wife to them and now that is all she uses it is  good quality. I have used these towels from childhood  up till now and they  even  get  under  my winkles really nice I am  78 years of age and everyone that sees me says naw you can&#x27;t be ..I owe some of my  youthness to this cloth.</li>
    <li> When I first used this product I was disappointed that it was quite rough. Then I realized that my skin did not get red from it or have any other ill affects. Also, it may actually be beneficial as I have dry, flaky skin. On a more general level, I have never used a wash towel before and am very happy that I tried it. It is much more versatile than my back brush, it rinses clean in a few seconds, and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> This thing will clean your skin better than anything else.  It has an exfoliating scratchiness that is harsh at first, but great once you get used to it.  It does not make your skin tough, but rather soft after long term light use.  You can still use it even if you have really soft skin.  I had one of these growing up and it&#x27;s lasts for years.</li>
    <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH THIS REVIEW)!&lt;br /&gt;If you DO receive a look-alike from an unscrupulous merchant and the package says &amp;#34;Made In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam from small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)...I THEN continue to use the now-shorter, &amp;#34;spent&amp;#34; cloth for house-hold scrubbing of bath-stalls, stoves, ovens, soiled pots/pans, etc. This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It usually fully-dries in less then a couple of hours when hung from its end or draped in its middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GREAT!! (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
    <li> I first was introduced to these wonderful bath towels in Hawaii when visiting my brother and have been hooked ever since. I do all I can to keep them on hand and often give them to special friends as gifts. All I can say is you have not had a invigorating bath/shower until you use this item. My husband likes it as well.</li>
    <li> This bath cloth is amazing! It&#x27;s made from the same kind of material as the scrubby bath puffs that I normally use, but woven much tighter. You can use this with any shower gel or bar soap, and it lathers up beautifully. I was a bit shocked at how scratchy it was the first time I used it, but quickly grew to love it. I don&#x27;t think I would feel that I was getting clean enough using my old &#x27;puff&#x27; now! I love that it is long enough to reach my entire back. After using this cloth in the shower/bath, I follow up with a great body lotion, and my skin has never felt better! I have only been using this for about two weeks now, and the KP on the back of my arms is about 90% gone! Dries quickly, so no worries about it harboring any mold or bacteria. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used many exfoliation items (loofah, etc.).  This leaves my skin with a poished feeling.  And my moisturizers have been working better since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
    <li> I think everyone should have a salux! It works so much better than using a washcloth or a body scrub to exfoliate. I use this every other day in the shower and my skin has never been softer. It&#x27;s easy to over-do it so be gentle with it until you get used to it. I love that its longer so I can easily use it to scrub my back. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this.... Very irritating to the skin. I will probably cut into washcloth size pieces abd use it on my feet.</li>
    <li> i have been a scratcher since i can remember and have the scars to prove it!&lt;br /&gt;this has a medium abrasive surface that has been slowly lessening the old scars.</li>
    <li> I love these and I give them as gifts..they are great..</li>
    <li> I love the nice cleansing and deep tissue massage i get with this cloth/towel. If using this during a body detox this cloth/towel will assist with bringing all impurities to the skins surface. But for the most part it&#x27;s not to abrasive on the body and I love it. Don&#x27;t use on the face.Also, you can cut this up and make it lasts longer if need be. Free of bacteria and dries quickly. Good product.</li>
    <li> Whoa! Scrub your face off! This is not at all what I wanted or was expecting to get when I ordered it. I bought many of these little scrubbing cloths when I lived in San Fransico and got them in Japantown. This monster is not at all like any of those. It is hard, stiff and has a texture that will easily take off two or three layers of skin without trying. Only purchase this if you want something like a Brillo pad, then you&#x27;re in luck.</li>
    <li> This product is overpriced, in my opinion. It does work well as an exfoliant but it&#x27;s almost painful to use, even when not pushing down hard. It does wash out easily and dry quickly, which are both pluses. The length is awkward though - it&#x27;s too long.</li>
    <li> This is like those puffy scrubby things on a rope. It is a bit rougher and it makes my skin smooth. It can go back and forth behind your back to get it clean as it is long. I hang mine over the shower head to dry. Lathers easily too!</li>
    <li> Received quick, will use this seller again for this product. It&#x27;s the original longer ones, not cheap like swap meet ones. great product love using it. Makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> I love this cloth. I will buy this item again.</li>
    <li> The Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloths were PERFECT!  I got 2 for me &amp; surprised one of my sisters with the other 2 &amp; she was soooo jazzed!  Thank you for carrying this wonderful product.  They shipped it to me so quick &amp; I was so impressed.  Thank you Amazon, you did it again you had what I was looking for &amp; a quality product!!!  :D</li>
    <li> I have been using this product nearly every day for over 25 years and simply do not feel clean if I wash without it. It is very low maintenance - just rinse it out and hang to dry - and lasts forever. I would rate this an essential item.</li>
    <li> This bath cloth works very efficient in exfoliating body skin, so it saves me time since I don&#x27;t need to keep rubbing my skin any more. It&#x27;s also very easy and convenient to use especially for washing my back. Just a reminder to other users, since the cloth is a bit rough, use it gently on body skin and I would not recommend on facial skin for it may be too harsh.</li>
    <li> Of all the &amp;#34;scrubbers&amp;#34; out there, this brand is the best.&lt;br /&gt;One needs to use it for about two weeks to break it in.&lt;br /&gt;Odd, that one needs to &#x27;break in&#x27; a washing cloth, but&lt;br /&gt;pay attention and see how much better it lathers and&lt;br /&gt;feels after two weeks.</li>
