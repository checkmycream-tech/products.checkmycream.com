      <li>this ish smelled like my great grandma would probably wear it.  </li>
      <li>One of my patients came in smelling great and this is when I discovered Angel.  </li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t happy.  </li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>I get great prices on Angel rather than the dept. stores.</li>
      <li>It is very nice and long-lasting.</li>
      <li>and my husband can&#x27;t walk by without nuzzling my neck and telling me how good I smell.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this fragrance!  </li>
      <li>Kind of earthy one minute and almost a vanilla undertone</li>
      <li>and this is very light like an eau de toilette not perfume.</li>
      <li>require too many words</li>
      <li>I bought the smallest bottle I could find since I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it.</li>
      <li>I love the earthy smell of this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s alright</li>
      <li>Its almost a musky scent, more of a hippie oil than a perfume.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear perfume and he doesn&#x27;t like the smell of most of them but had said he was rather fond of this one.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Cute bottle love the scent</li>
      <li>and I think it has a sexy smell.</li>
      <li>I love how the scent seems to change.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn Angel for years and absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>The most unique and interesting fragrance.  </li>
      <li>this was a free sample.  </li>
      <li>It almost smelled like a cheap Avon perfume.  </li>
      <li>def worth the money!</li>
      <li>Guys, if you&#x27;re looking for a Christmas gift for that special person, this is it.</li>
      <li>I must tell you there is a lot of knock offs out there,so makes sure its the real deal.</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I have worn it every day since I got it</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ve added a scale now, it is good, so people will not be deceived by the photo of your tiny Angel</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the fragrance, This is my special day parfum, Love the cute little bottle too!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I wear Angel most of the time and have many different perfumes.</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best prices and spend a little more money on the bigger bottles rather than paying for sample size bottles.</li>
      <li>Being able to buy a sample size is an inexpensive way to try something new.</li>
      <li>but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>The lotions are great to go with the perfume and the fragrance will last til the next day.</li>
      <li>Smelled like cheap and very old perfume...dont not buy</li>
      <li>My wife has been wearing this scent for a couple of years now and she consistently gets asked for the name of the scent she is wearing.</li>
      <li>My husband told me about Angel before we got married.</li>
      <li>Angel is my favorite fragrance, and I wanted a smaller size for travel.</li>
      <li>love the perfurme however could the bottle get any smaller?</li>
      <li>it smelt like a cheap imitation of the original , and the product was not boxed which made me suspicious</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
      <li>it was much smaller than i expected would not recommend it to any one smell great but it needed to be a bigger bottle</li>
      <li>so I just needed a new small spray bottle to have handy.  </li>
      <li>They look forward to getting a new Christmas set every year.</li>
      <li>You register it and just get some samples or updates on new products.</li>
      <li>The product was watered down and is definitely not perfume because Angel perfume is very strong and it stays with you-</li>
      <li>This seems like it may be an imitation of the original Angel.  </li>
      <li>Soft and angelic is how I would describe it...</li>
      <li>(The only downside to this particular size is the stopper in the bottle.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>

    <li> Absolutely love the fragrance, This is my special day parfum, Love the cute little bottle too!&lt;br /&gt;You require too many words</li>
    <li> Cute bottle love the scent</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve added a scale now, it is good, so people will not be deceived by the photo of your tiny Angel</li>
    <li> This seems like it may be an imitation of the original Angel.  I got no hints of patchouli in this at all.  It almost smelled like a cheap Avon perfume.  Not what I expected at all!!!!!  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance!  Soft and angelic is how I would describe it...just heavenly.  Guys, if you&#x27;re looking for a Christmas gift for that special person, this is it.</li>
    <li> The product was watered down and is definitely not perfume because Angel perfume is very strong and it stays with you- and this is very light like an eau de toilette not perfume.</li>
    <li> Angel is my favorite fragrance, and I wanted a smaller size for travel. This fits the bill perfectly. I took it with me on a cruise in November, and it was great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Angel for years and absolutely love it.  I like to switch up my scents and rotate between a few different perfumes so I just needed a new small spray bottle to have handy.  I selected this one because it was the size I needed and a spray...or so I thought.  When it arrived it was a completely different bottle and did NOT have the spritzer.  So now when I want to wear Angel I have to tip the bottle over onto my finger and dab it onto my skin.  Very annoying.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s alright</li>
    <li> My wife has been wearing this scent for a couple of years now and she consistently gets asked for the name of the scent she is wearing. It is a lighter, sweeter scent and isn&#x27;t overpowering. It is a little pricey but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I wear Angel most of the time and have many different perfumes.I get a lot of compliments and I think it has a sexy smell. My husband loves it and I have turned my daughter and others on to trying it. They look forward to getting a new Christmas set every year. I must tell you there is a lot of knock offs out there,so makes sure its the real deal.Terry Mugler has a web site and usual inside his packages there is a code.You register it and just get some samples or updates on new products.Amazon has the best prices and spend a little more money on the bigger bottles rather than paying for sample size bottles.The lotions are great to go with the perfume and the fragrance will last til the next day.You don,t need to put a lot on,because the fragrance has stronger notes.A little goes a long ways.Thanks to Amazon I get great prices on Angel rather than the dept. stores.</li>
    <li> The most unique and interesting fragrance.  Absolutely love it!  Nothing else like this out there. This will be my signature fragrance for a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband told me about Angel before we got married. I don&#x27;t wear perfume and he doesn&#x27;t like the smell of most of them but had said he was rather fond of this one. Its almost a musky scent, more of a hippie oil than a perfume. I love how the scent seems to change. Kind of earthy one minute and almost a vanilla undertone the next. I love it so much that I have worn it every day since I got it and my husband can&#x27;t walk by without nuzzling my neck and telling me how good I smell. I bought the smallest bottle I could find since I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it. It is going to last quite some time. It doesn&#x27;t take much.  I will be buying the larger bottle next time. (The only downside to this particular size is the stopper in the bottle. The way it pulls out, I&#x27;m afraid I am going to end up spilling it trying to open it but the bigger bottles have spray tops.)</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews I saw posted.. Not a good idea.  Im a 27 y/o female and this ish smelled like my great grandma would probably wear it.  Whew!!! It does not fit the body chemistry of young women.  Please do not buy this if you younger than 45.. lol. (I am reaaally serious).</li>
    <li> it smelt like a cheap imitation of the original , and the product was not boxed which made me suspicious</li>
    <li> Had no clue this was a free sample.  The label even said &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34;....um, it got resold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the perfume, don&#x27;t like the fact that I had to pay for a sample.</li>
    <li> It was horrible.  The box was banged up and the bottle was leaking. The seal on the cap was poorly made. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this fragrance.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t the size that i thought it was for the price i paid for it wasn&#x27;t happy.  not happy at all</li>
    <li> it was much smaller than i expected would not recommend it to any one smell great but it needed to be a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> I was not sure if I would like it, so I just purchase a small sample.  It is very nice and long-lasting.</li>
    <li> I love the earthy smell of this fragrance. you only need to use a little. Being able to buy a sample size is an inexpensive way to try something new.</li>
    <li> Smelled like cheap and very old perfume...dont not buy</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of TM for a long time....don&#x27;t need to spray a lot...goes a long way and stays all day....def worth the money!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found a perfume that I like for ages.  One of my patients came in smelling great and this is when I discovered Angel.  love it</li>
    <li> love the perfurme however could the bottle get any smaller?</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. I just wish it would have been a spray bottle. But if I would&#x27;ve read the description, I guess I would have realized that.</li>
