      <li>I love it and use it alone instead of a foundation</li>
      <li>If you live in a humid area, or have oily skin, this primer is great.</li>

      <li>I agree with other reviewers that this product can be worn on its own and still look great.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good but in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t live up to the reviews I&#x27;ve seen.</li>

      <li>so I suspect it will last awhile, but I will buy it again, for sure!</li>
      <li>The lady who gives me facial recommend this primer to me and I love it!  </li>
      <li>When really I just want to wear it all the time because it makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>This primer is actually worth the money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell though.  </li>
      <li>It really makes my skin smooth and helps my other makeup go on nice and smooth as well.</li>
      <li>After applying the primer, it&#x27;s a good idea to wait at least 5 min before applying foundation for best results, at least that&#x27;s been my experience.</li>
      <li>This product worn under coverup works really well!</li>
      <li>and I use it by itself or over a higher spf product (like Cerave AM)</li>
      <li>It really works to make skin look fresh.</li>
      <li>I wear the primer under the Wild to Mild bronzer and my skin looks young, fresh and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Although this product does go on evenly and smoothly, has a nice smell, and gives me no acne, it is too thick to just be a primer.</li>
      <li>On those special occasions when I&#x27;ve had my makeup applied  by a professional, they marvel at this product.  </li>
      <li>Used it for 4 weeks and didn&#x27;t notice anything positive.</li>
      <li>I have large pores and it helps cover them.</li>
      <li>Goes really well with the mineral powder foundation.</li>
      <li>It really helps to keep my foundation/powder in place for the day.</li>
      <li>BUT it really really works.</li>
      <li>The ingredients titanium dioxide &amp; zinc oxide clogged my pores &amp; made my skin real bumpy.  </li>
      <li>This was recommended to me by my esthetician as a very calming and beneficial product to use for my 50+yr skin.</li>
      <li>The third time and onwards I noticed how my skin glowed and looked really smooth.  </li>
      <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I have used the primer wild to mild in the past and it is fantastic, but never this</li>
      <li>It did brighten skin &amp; went on real smooth, a little went a long way.  </li>
      <li>I have dry, fair skin, and sometimes my skin gets a little red, and nothing else has ever done the trick like this.</li>
      <li>Not only does it work well to tone down my red blotches, brighten my skin and create a nice canvas for my foundation, but I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and my pores don&#x27;t seemed to look as clogged.</li>
      <li>On a whim I decided to try it out and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it did just what it said.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is so light, does not feel heavy, and it seems to protect and repair your skin.</li>
      <li>It really smooths and takes the red away.</li>
      <li>Also I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It goes on like silk, it&#x27;s nourishing, soft and practically invisible.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face feel like velvet, conceals pores, and is an excellent base for mineral powder foundation.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used a skin primer in the past but noticed my eye shadow wasn&#x27;t going on as smoothly as it used to.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that I wish there was more.</li>
      <li>First let me be very clear, I very rarely wear make-up, mainly because I&#x27;m bad at doing it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I wear it alone-  No powder or foundation.  I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have ALWAYS HAD OILY SKIN!  It evens out my skin tone, which is a little ruddy, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since 2007 and I love the product! Great for people with Rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price and it lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> This product fills in lines/wrinkles. It smooths out the skin making your skin a very good primed surface for foundation or powdered minerals. This was a present from my daughter the skin care specialist. I did not know it was so pricey. BUT it really really works. So I will be getting some more soon.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  The texture of the cream is amazing, it glides on so smoothly and makes your skin feel and look instantly better.  I cannot recommend this product enough!  Best primer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I have dry, fair skin, and sometimes my skin gets a little red, and nothing else has ever done the trick like this. I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation--I can put this on and it looks like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup--and it looks like I don&#x27;t need to. It really smooths and takes the red away. Instead of sunscreen + foundation, I can just put this on. But it also makes the tinted moisturizer look good on top of it. My only complaint is that I wish there was more. The bottle is so small. I find myself rationing it--sometimes I won&#x27;t put it on if I know I&#x27;m not going to go outside for long. When really I just want to wear it all the time because it makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> I had never wanted to use a primer before.  But I had microdermabrasion done two months ago and the technician put this on my face afterward.  It was wonderful.  So I bought the product and I can&#x27;t love it more.  It goes on like silk, it&#x27;s nourishing, soft and practically invisible.  It smooths out discolorations and lines.  It can also be combined with a little of the bronzer to give a little tint.  Then you can put your regular makeup over it.  (I use Lancome.)  It is so light, does not feel heavy, and it seems to protect and repair your skin.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in the beauty section of a \\&quot;Everygirl&#x27;s Guide to Life Book\\&quot; written by a famous person who tried it after having it recommended to her by Cameron Diaz.  I was looking for something to brighten and smooth my skin as well as a good primer.  I looked this product up online and it&#x27;s a little pricier than what I&#x27;d normally spend, but I&#x27;m 39 and as 40 gets closer I&#x27;m becoming more deperate for GOOD products that WORK.  This product is worth every penny!  Not only does it work well to tone down my red blotches, brighten my skin and create a nice canvas for my foundation, but I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and my pores don&#x27;t seemed to look as clogged. I highly recommend this product.  A little goes a long way so I suspect it will last awhile, but I will buy it again, for sure!</li>
    <li> This primer is actually worth the money. It makes my face feel like velvet, conceals pores, and is an excellent base for mineral powder foundation. Even without foundation, makes my skin look brighter and more even toned.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and I love it.  It really helps to keep my foundation/powder in place for the day.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a skin primer in the past but noticed my eye shadow wasn&#x27;t going on as smoothly as it used to.  So I did some research and decided to give this product a try.  I love it!  Since I started using it on my face I have received several compliments about my skin/make-up/general appearance and this was the only different product I was using.  It brightens my face, helps even my skin tone (I tend to have redness), makes my make up go on nice and smooth, and just makes my face look better.  Also I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this has not bothered me.  I don&#x27;t wear make-up ever day, so I am using it just a couple times per week, but I am very happy I chose this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Colorescience Skin Brightening Face Primer for several years at the suggestion of my dermatologist because I have rosacea.  It&#x27;s a nice and light product to use.  I&#x27;ve never had any skin issues when using this product.</li>
    <li> On those special occasions when I&#x27;ve had my makeup applied  by a professional, they marvel at this product.  Does the trick.  Been using for at least 15 years</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product for the purpose of evening out my skin tone, and while I wasn&#x27;t super impressed by how effective it was at helping with that, I was floored to see how much it reduced shine on my face. I&#x27;ve been through dozens of products to eliminate the oil shine that accumulates on my nose throughout the day, and this one finally did it!</li>
    <li> As promised by a blog I read, this product smooths out my lines and prepares my face for powder.  A great product.</li>
    <li> It brightens the face and smooths out the skin so makeup goes on smoothly and improves coverage.  Plus - sunscreen</li>
    <li> Used it for 4 weeks and didn&#x27;t notice anything positive. My skin is oily and this product made it worse.</li>
    <li> People on review sites have raved about this stuff so thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It&#x27;s good but in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t live up to the reviews I&#x27;ve seen. I like Studio Gear&#x27;s primer, my makeup goes on very nice with this primer. With the Colorscience, it&#x27;s supposed to be a skin brightening face primer, don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;Brightening&amp;#34; or any difference in the look of my skin. After applying the primer, it&#x27;s a good idea to wait at least 5 min before applying foundation for best results, at least that&#x27;s been my experience.</li>
    <li> Thick, chalky, really terrible.  There is no way you could put makeup over this and have it look good. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my facial provider and I save money by purchasing it here on amazon.com rather than at the salon. This is now an essential part of my daily morning routine. Fills in my face pores and allows makeup to go on easier and last all day! Also tones down the redness in my face - always a plus!</li>
    <li> I like the matte quality for my oily skin and the SPF 20.  Goes on smoothly. That is about all I have to say but you have to type so many words to get your review to work.</li>
    <li> The lady who gives me facial recommend this primer to me and I love it!  It covers well and helps my skin glow.  I have large pores and it helps cover them.</li>
    <li> This product worn under coverup works really well! There was prompt delivery, as described, and if have convinced lots of folks to buy it!</li>
    <li> If you live in a humid area, or have oily skin, this primer is great. It has a sunblock in it (so don&#x27;t get it in your eyes) and helps makeup to stick, especially if you only use minerals. Get another eye primer though, leaving this for face...</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it with a moisturizer in the winter and alone in the summer with a powder finish. It eliminates redness, leaves my face feeling smooth and has a pleasant smell. I was able to eliminate a liquid foundation using this, which lead to better skin and a more natural look. I would recommend this primer to anyone especially if you suffer from redness or discoloration.</li>
    <li> It goes on so nicely -- feels great &amp; dewy. Plus, it has an SPF of 20. I mix it in with my Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and it makes that go on more smoothly. Can also wear this alone (I put it on after my moisturizer).</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product.It works great. Sometimes I just use this to even out my skin tone and skip the foundation.I have oily skin and this product keeps the oil under control all day.</li>
    <li> It makes my make-up foundation glide on. I&#x27;ve used other products, but they almost seem oil-based. This one makes me feel like my moisturizer is sealed in and the make-up goes on top of the primer as a barrier between the two.  Service and delivery, by the way, was exceptional.</li>
    <li> It makes makeup go on smoother and does seem to tame lines a bit.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell though.  Smells kind of toxic.</li>
    <li> good product - I&#x27;ve been using this product for a awhile now.  I am very pleased with it - definitely recommend.  great for fine lines.</li>
    <li> First let me be very clear, I very rarely wear make-up, mainly because I&#x27;m bad at doing it.&lt;br /&gt;I just happened to see a show were someone recommended it for people who wanted to tone down the redness on their face. On a whim I decided to try it out and was pleasantly surprised to discover that it did just what it said.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is you just run it all over, so no make-up skills required. The redness is toned down if not completely gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the same skin problems I did- I would definitely consider purchasing this product. It&#x27;s a little expensive but it also lasts a long time because a little of it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps you make your decision.&lt;br /&gt;~Beth</li>
    <li> I was not overly impressed.  Maybe its because my skin is not too uneven in tone.  If you want brightening, use Samshbox Artificial light.  It really works to make skin look fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this primer. It really makes my skin smooth and helps my other makeup go on nice and smooth as well. light and fresh</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my esthetician as a very calming and beneficial product to use for my 50+yr skin. I love it and use it alone instead of a foundation</li>
    <li> Although this product does go on evenly and smoothly, has a nice smell, and gives me no acne, it is too thick to just be a primer. I usually use it before bare minerals foundation but its very thick and makes my skin oily</li>
    <li> It did brighten skin &amp; went on real smooth, a little went a long way.  The ingredients titanium dioxide &amp; zinc oxide clogged my pores &amp; made my skin real bumpy.  I will not use again</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I got a reject bottle and it would not pump. Could not send it back for an exchange due to &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; reasons in the packaging. I am sorely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Received within several days after ordered.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> Great product which I&#x27;ve used for years. Bought it initially at the recommendation of my dermatologist&#x27;s aesthetician after a microdermabrasion.  Gets the red out!  Doesn&#x27;t look yellow.  Protects and hydrates and I use it by itself or over a higher spf product (like Cerave AM) if I&#x27;m outside during peak sun time. Minimizes pores and makes my skin glowy</li>
    <li> Great primer that I am never without.</li>
    <li> When I tried it the first two times I was not that impressed.  The third time and onwards I noticed how my skin glowed and looked really smooth.  I agree with other reviewers that this product can be worn on its own and still look great.  I am all about wearing less or no makeup at all.</li>
    <li> Every day product, smoothes out pores, reduces redness, removes mascara and  unwanted make up around the eyes, plus it protects against the sun!</li>
    <li> Too thick, and I didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> It a fair product - doesn&#x27;t hold on my skin - for the cost will not buy again</li>
    <li> I have a least 3 different Primers at home so I only purchased this to try with the Brush Tan Sunscreen. Gave a really nice canvas for the sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Product goes on smooth. and has a yellow ting which gives a uniform glow on my skin.  Recommend it highly. I use it daily as a sunscreen and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Not really sure about this item. I have used the primer wild to mild in the past and it is fantastic, but never this, it made my face breakout, therefore I feel is not a good product. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I wear the primer under the Wild to Mild bronzer and my skin looks young, fresh and smooth.  Can&#x27;t go without!</li>
    <li> Great base for powder foundation!</li>
    <li> Best primer around! Skin feels silky and evens the tone. Goes really well with the mineral powder foundation. Excellent price and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Great concealer and primer!</li>
