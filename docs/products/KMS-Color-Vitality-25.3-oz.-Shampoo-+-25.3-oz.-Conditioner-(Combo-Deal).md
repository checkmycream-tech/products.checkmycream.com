      <li>Also this is one amazing price.</li>
      <li>Fab shampoo - amazing prince and</li>
      <li>Shampoo and conditioner are good products for color treated hair, but could be a bit more moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon Prime for almost 1/2 the cost of what I was paying at my salon.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best deal I&#x27;ve found too!</li>

      <li>but I like the moisture repair line better.</li>
      <li>I always love this shampoo but it always leaks when i buy it.</li>
      <li>My salon uses this product line, so I have been searching for better price and a way for it to be delivered to my home.</li>
      <li>it smelled lovely.</li>
      <li>It gave my already wavy hair more body and shine.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I pay a lot at the salon to have my hair colored, and this is like an insurance policy to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fade between appointments.</li>
      <li>and I love just having it delivered to you.</li>
      <li>but i still love the product.</li>
      <li>I understand we all buy shampoos where some smell better than others but this one is in a category all by itself.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I have used this combo for 2 years and love it.  </li>
      <li>I love Purology, but just can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
      <li>My hair is noticiably more shinier and softer.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, as it works great with my colored hair, but most of all I like saving money and Amazon offers it for a much better price than the beauty shops.</li>
      <li>I immediately emailed customer service about what had happened and they were quick to send me another set sealed better with no problems</li>
      <li>Smells clean too...</li>
      <li>Conditioner leaves your hair nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>I have dyed hair and have noticed the color is more vibrant when I use KMS Color Vitality.</li>
      <li>Very fast delivery too!</li>
      <li>KMS Color Vitality makes my hair feel healthy and soft.  </li>
      <li>Bottles are nice and big.</li>
      <li>Conditioner arrived with a small leak, but otherwise everything else was great,</li>
      <li>Amazon consistently has this set for a price that beats my salon and Ulta any day.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>So I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much.</li>
      <li>And I really like the purple color added to both.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>deliver fast</li>
      <li>Holds color really well</li>
      <li>I have extremely long hair that dangles easily.</li>
      <li>Just realize that you&#x27;re more or less buying a type of product that is sold in drug stores (IMO).</li>
      <li>I would recommend it vey highly, both of these products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these as a  set because It truly helps my hair.</li>
      <li>Highly Highly recommended from me to you.</li>
      <li>I use it every other day and my hair is so soft, manageable, and keeping its highlights :-)  </li>
      <li>I recently ordered the KMS California Color Vitality in the liter size and got it pretty fast but both bottles some</li>
      <li>I am so glad to have found these because It&#x27;s the only things that helps my fine thin blonde hair.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much either..this should last awhile!!</li>
      <li>My hair ends up soft with no residue feeling.  </li>
      <li>However I was really surprised how it makes my hair really soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>Well, I am giving this 3/5 stars partially because I didn&#x27;t read for the right buzz words when purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also one of the only products I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
      <li>It removes all the dull residue from my hair as when swimming and sun damages think baby fine hair.</li>

<li> You don&#x27;t need to use much of either product - a little goes a long way.  </li>

<li> Not to mention, my roots are less noticeable.  </li>
<li> This product as sulfates in it, which is odd to met because it touts itself as a salon quality product (although I have never seen it sold in any salon I have gone to).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also used the shampoo made for blondes and my blonde hardly yellowed at all!</li>
<li> Most store bought shampoos and conditioners, even the ones that cost $13-$15 a bottle, either give me awful buildup, or my hair is dry and frizzy.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works on other hair types, but this was the answer to my prayers!</li>

    <li> Will definitely order again. I have dyed hair and have noticed the color is more vibrant when I use KMS Color Vitality.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! I have never used a shampoo that protects my color as well as KMS does, and it smells great too! This is by far the best deal I&#x27;ve found too! I&#x27;ve also used the shampoo made for blondes and my blonde hardly yellowed at all!</li>
    <li> KMS works great for me.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! My hair is noticiably more shinier and softer.  Not to mention, my roots are less noticeable.  The only negative thing is that there was some leakage on the bottles when they arrived.  Other than that, I have no complaints and will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> This product is great. It lasts for months and I love just having it delivered to you. You save a bundle over buying it in a salon</li>
    <li> Great for color-treated hair, and smells great too!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for blonds (me) and also great for grey hair (hubby). It keeps his hair a beautiful shade of gery with no yellowing in it and it keeps my color from looking brassy. An all around great shampoo..</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever!  Holds color really well</li>
    <li> I have been using this duo for several years. I pay a lot at the salon to have my hair colored, and this is like an insurance policy to make sure it doesn&#x27;t fade between appointments. It&#x27;s also one of the only products I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down. A bonus is, it smells great too! I love Purology, but just can&#x27;t afford it. These products are a close second. Amazon consistently has this set for a price that beats my salon and Ulta any day.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this line by my stylist, and although I never buy salon S&amp;C, I was treating myself, and it is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever found!  I have fine hair, but a lot of hair, that usually either looks fly-a-way and frazzled, or by the next day if I don&#x27;t wash, looks like I&#x27;m a greasy haired lazy person who doesn&#x27;t wash her hair!

I&#x27;m not sure how it works on other hair types, but this was the answer to my prayers!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner!!  I have tried so many looking for that perfect combo &amp; this is it.  Seems like shampoo/conditioner&#x27;s for color treated hair always leaves my hair dull after a couple weeks, not this.  And I really like the purple color added to both.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> deliver fast and i love this product !!</li>
    <li> Smells great and adds lots of softness. However, it faded my brown hair A LOT! It did not preserve the color at all and I go to a salon that uses the organix hair color system. Little disappointed</li>
    <li> KMS Color Vitality makes my hair feel healthy and soft.  It is the best shampoo I have used since coloring my hair.</li>
    <li> It gave my already wavy hair more body and shine. I would recommend it vey highly, both of these products.</li>
    <li> When the package arrived the bottles were leaking. This is my favorite shampoo and it was a great deal.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I have extremely long hair that dangles easily. So I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much. However I was really surprised how it makes my hair really soft and manageable. I will be reordering when I run out .</li>
    <li> Everything was great but when I got was covered in the product I had to wash the bottles because it was everywhere</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for colored hair.  It keeps the color from fading!</li>
    <li> JustwhatIordered,butcamealittlelate.</li>
    <li> Conditioner and shampoo came well packaged.  Conditioner leaves your hair nice and soft.  Both have a good smell</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. I just spend tons of money on her hair color and bought this shampoo to help her maintain color.</li>
    <li> Great set. Conditioner arrived with a small leak, but otherwise everything else was great,</li>
    <li> Good product for &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair oil types.  Didn&#x27;t cause fading to dark hair colors.  Smells clean too... If you have thick or dry hair- not sure it would be for you...</li>
    <li> This line is excellent for color treated fine hair, like mine.  You don&#x27;t need to use much of either product - a little goes a long way.  I hope they never change their formula.</li>
    <li> Read reviews that some people had problems with leakage, I had no problem with that.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS STUFF!  I use it every other day and my hair is so soft, manageable, and keeping its highlights :-)  I followed reviews all over for the best shampoo/conditioner combo, and this is IT.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Well, I am giving this 3/5 stars partially because I didn&#x27;t read for the right buzz words when purchasing this product. This product as sulfates in it, which is odd to met because it touts itself as a salon quality product (although I have never seen it sold in any salon I have gone to). I get expensive salon services and don&#x27;t want to even risk undoing them because I used a product that is no better than Suave or Tresemme. Just realize that you&#x27;re more or less buying a type of product that is sold in drug stores (IMO).</li>
    <li> I love this product, as it works great with my colored hair, but most of all I like saving money and Amazon offers it for a much better price than the beauty shops.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the KMS California Color Vitality in the liter size and got it pretty fast but both bottles some how leaked all over the box it came in. I immediately emailed customer service about what had happened and they were quick to send me another set sealed better with no problems and I didn&#x27;t have to pay a dime. I will definitely buy from them again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;be been using this product line for years on suggestion of my hair stylist and these prices are so much better than hers</li>
    <li> The shampoo strips your hair and the conditioner does nothing to moisturize it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for several years.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon Prime for almost 1/2 the cost of what I was paying at my salon.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo!  You don&#x27;t need much either..this should last awhile!!</li>
    <li> I just bought this shampoo last week. The shampoo, in itself, is great.  My hair ends up soft with no residue feeling.  HOWEVER...  it&#x27;s the most horrible smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!  It smelled great when I checked in the store, but there is something that happens to it after it comes out of the bottle that&#x27;s just vile.  The smell even wakes me up when I roll over and smell it on my pillow.  I understand we all buy shampoos where some smell better than others but this one is in a category all by itself.  I feel bad for giving this a bad review, since it&#x27;s actually a very good shampoo, but the smell is unbearable.</li>
    <li> Shampoo and conditioner are good products for color treated hair, but could be a bit more moisturizing.  I&#x27;m definitely not a fan of the scent.</li>
    <li> I always love this shampoo but it always leaks when i buy it. Kinda a bummer but i still love the product.</li>
    <li> We received 2 bottles of conditioner instead of 1 shampoo and 1 conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used this combo for 2 years and love it.  Also it is cheaper online than in store..</li>
    <li> My salon uses this product line, so I have been searching for better price and a way for it to be delivered to my home. This was both! Works great and smells delious! Very fast delivery too! Would recommend to anyone with colored hair!</li>
    <li> bought it for a present nobody complained about it</li>
    <li> Love this product !  It has a wonderful clean fragrance and leaves the hair feelling so clean !</li>
    <li> Fab shampoo - amazing prince and it smelled lovely. Will def buy again! Awesome at taking the brassiness away. Yay!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. Leaves my hair super soft and manageable. Great smell. Doesn&#x27;t dull the color.</li>
