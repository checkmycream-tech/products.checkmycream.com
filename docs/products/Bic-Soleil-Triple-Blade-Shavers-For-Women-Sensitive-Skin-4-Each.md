### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Also, if these cut your legs, maybe your legs just can&#x27;t withstand how awesome these are.</li>
      <li>Knowing how to use them will show you they are the BEST disposable razor you can buy!!!!</li>
      <li>the best part is that the blades are spaced in a way so that hair doesnt get stuck between the blades.</li>
      <li>Good luck with your decision!</li>
      <li>great razor company that has amazing deals is Dorco - check them out online and try their trial packages to find the best razor for you.  </li>
      <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.</li>
      <li>great buy.  </li>
      <li>It gets a great close shave</li>
      <li>but i havent experienced this problem at all.</li>
      <li>It just reaffirmed how great these razors are.    </li>
      <li>But of all the razors I&#x27;ve tried, I can honestly say that the ladies win with these ones from Bic.</li>
      <li>Want a good razor?</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve bought all sorts of non-disposable razors, from &#x27;fancy&#x27; to &#x27;not fancy,&#x27; and none have been as good.     </li>
      <li>My sister and I have been using these razors for a while and have nothing but good things to say about them.</li>
      <li>The fun design and inclusion of razor covers make these the best non-pivoting disposable razors I have used.  </li>
      <li>just makes the hair disappear like magic, even bikini hair!</li>
      <li>this razor is amazing.</li>
      <li>And it has a great comfortable feel in your hand.     </li>
      <li>However, I found an extremely amazing deal on Bic Soleils, and ended up buying 3 packs of them.</li>
      <li>The razor gives a nice close shave unlike what I have had with venus, intuition, etc.</li>
      <li>Since then I have discovered the Venus Divine and am thrilled with the results there.  </li>
      <li>If so, they would have easily determined that these razors leave something to be desired: namely, your own skin.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think by now that they&#x27;d have perfected one razor to the point where there wouldn&#x27;t need to be more features or anything.</li>
      <li>I love this razor.  </li>
      <li>If you want to go disposable, I think Schick SlimTwins work much better.  </li>
      <li>great razor for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Pace for a year now, love it.  </li>
      <li>Now Let me assure you that I have been shaving my legs for 15 years and never before have I nicked myself more than once.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bic is a great brand, I love their ink pens, but my skin is just too sensitive for their razors.</li>
      <li>I bought these razors mostly because they were cheap and had 3 blades.</li>
      <li>These razors are surprisingly good for disposables, and very cost-effective when purchased through Amazon subscribe and save.</li>
      <li>It is sharp, but I get an awesome, close shave, and I have never cut myself (I use Dove soap to lather with).  </li>
      <li>HUGE mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even the cheap, no brand name disposables are gentler on the legs than these.  </li>
      <li>It is cheap and I did not plan on spending 10 dollars for another razor.</li>
      <li>so I bought this cheap Bic razor in Target.</li>
      <li>Just to further illustrate how great these are, I shave w/just water...</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re still cheap</li>
      <li>They are pretty, but that&#x27;s about it!!</li>
      <li>I was taking a nice hot bath and excited to use these colorful shavers.</li>
      <li>i really didnt expect such a feminine girly looking razor to work so good!</li>
      <li>They will get rid of the hair, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing they will do.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;ll only want more!  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the money for me.</li>
      <li>For me, the Soleil Triple Blade razors are not only very sturdy, but they last a while, and get the job done perfectly.</li>
      <li>i get this on the subscribe and save plan and find it an economical way to purchase.  </li>
      <li>The only times I&#x27;ve cut myself with it were because it was my own fault</li>
      <li>I bought a pack of these razors and used the first one...</li>
      <li>The first time I used these razors and stepped out of my shower dripping blood I thought perhaps it was just me.</li>
      <li>This is the first product review I have ever written</li>
      <li>I figured the more blades the better, because that&#x27;s usually the case.</li>
      <li>The strip can become gooey after the first couple uses.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this pack of razors-yes it was stupid-because of the pretty packaging.  </li>
      <li>I used the first one &amp; before I knew it, it sliced a 2\\&quot; chunk out of my leg.</li>
      <li>Also, there are pretty colors.</li>
      <li>and they are very itchy!</li>
      <li>Even if you are 12 years old and have young beautiful legs, if your skin is loose at all, it will cut you.</li>
      <li>I usually use Gillette Daisy, a cheap razor that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with.</li>
      <li>They obviously tried to make the product have an appealing design, but they are cheap and become dull very quickly.</li>
      <li>At least they didn&#x27;t insult my intelligence by offering me more free Bic razors.  </li>
      <li>You may think you&#x27;re saving money with these bargain razors, but really, you&#x27;re wasting it because you&#x27;ll want to throw them away after one use.</li>
      <li>NEVER did as much damage to my legs and nether regions as these did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you aren&#x27;t capable, it will cut you.  </li>
      <li>I came to amazon to see if I could find a great deal on these (not a great deal, BTW,</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve just been conditioned to shaving so much over the years or what,</li>
      <li>I really want to like these shavers, but I just can&#x27;t after what happened to me December 2008--I remember well--</li>
      <li>Some people say that the razors take off skin and pull hair too much.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with this razor and will use it for as long as they continue to make it.</li>
      <li>If you want a good close shave minus the irritation that cheaper razor may give you, I definitely would suggest this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried out many different razors over the last 15 years.</li>
      <li>away from these razors - obviously any product that has more 1 star reviews than anything else is a total Fail.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>On the other hand, this would not be good if you had loose skin in any way, shape, form or fashion.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these over the Mach 3 or Mach 5, Schick Quattro, Fusion...any of that stuff.</li>
      <li>All other disposable razors work great the first time, then they are so dull they get thrown away.</li>
      <li>Yes, they are very sharp when you get a new one out of the package, but that just means that the razor lasts for more than one shave.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s making me sound like some kind of overly-hairy freak, but when it comes down to it, I just plain don&#x27;t like hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to bet that most of the people who rated this product with one star have slight builds similar to mine.</li>
      <li>The three blades have a moisture strip above them, so the strip glides over areas right after the shave.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s new line of womens razors called, \\&quot;Soleil Triple Blade\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s easily 50% less than store brands.</li>
      <li>No matter how experienced you are or how careful you are, this razor will nick you at least once during a shaving session on a bony part, guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very rarely does hair build up in this razor, and that&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t say about some of the more expensive men&#x27;s razors.  </li>
      <li>As odd as it might sound from a guy, this razor is a must in your bathroom.</li>
      <li>My wife just sliced open both legs and her bikini area, using three different brand new Bic Soleil razors right out of the package.  </li>
      <li>However, with these razors, I had to bear my way through every use, and now I&#x27;ve given up on them completely.</li>
      <li>It said on the packet \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; and I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I am giving them 5 stars again because, thanks to Amazon, I know that they actually do have a refillable system.</li>
      <li>Especially my feet and lower legs, not so much on my heavier thighs.  </li>
      <li>Stay away, stay away, you&#x27;ll only end up using a whole box of band-aids to cover the gashes in your legs.</li>
      <li>Typically I&#x27;ll just use a regular bar of soap to lather up with before I shave, and it works just fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s funny to think about how many different kinds there&#x27;ve been in that amount of time, from single bladed to the now common triple bladed, to the vibrating razors with -five- blades.</li>
      <li>Even though I shave carefully, and haven&#x27;t cut myself in eons, the first time I used the Soleil, I got cut.</li>
      <li>So, I binned the blade and used a BRAND NEW ONE for the next shave.  </li>
      <li>Seriously I cut myself with these for 2 weeks straight, it wasn&#x27;t one of those \\&quot;new razor\\&quot; deals that cuts the first time you use them.</li>
      <li>Compared to the yellow Bic disposable razors I was introduced to during my early teens, and then avoided like the plague due to guaranteed nicks, these are a fair attempt to make me reconsider pricier brands with unnecessary \\&quot;improvements\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I wrote a complaint to the Bicworld website and they sent me a coupon for a free pen product up to $5.99 in value.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 34 years old, a veteran shaver.</li>
      <li>you really dont need to press this one too hard at all it is very sharp and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just as I was shaving the side of my right leg, my hand slipped and down went the shaver straight down my leg.</li>
      <li>My hair grows really fast and this razor lets me shave every other</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I want my money back.  These razors literally sliced up my legs.  Ridiculous.  I tried really hard to make them work, being extra careful, and no matter what angle I held them at, no matter how lightly I dragged them, they cut me every time.  I tried one, my daughter tried one, and I threw the other 2 in the pack away.  I tried to enter this review with NO stars, but it wouldn&#x27;t let me.</li>
    <li> Oh my... How awful it is to shave with one of these things. Purchase these for self defense as they behave somewhat like a box cutter. I never have issues with razors. These cut me to shreds. I yelped in pain from the shower. When my boyfriend came in and saw the blood on my towel-- his face sank. It hurt me for two days and I swore I would come online and write a review, because this product is defective. These blades are not fit for contact with human skin. Sorry for the dramatics but that cut HURT.</li>
    <li> Seriously?  I&#x27;ve never had such painful razor burn in my life.  I got a free one with my ECO shave cream and figured I should at least try it but no way.&lt;br /&gt;These horrible BIC Soleil razors should be banned.  Even soothing lotions won&#x27;t stop the burn! WTF&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from these razors - obviously any product that has more 1 star reviews than anything else is a total Fail.&lt;br /&gt;A great razor company that has amazing deals is Dorco - check them out online and try their trial packages to find the best razor for you.  I&#x27;ve been using the Pace for a year now, love it.  Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price, it&#x27;s easily 50% less than store brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried out many different razors over the last 15 years. It&#x27;s funny to think about how many different kinds there&#x27;ve been in that amount of time, from single bladed to the now common triple bladed, to the vibrating razors with -five- blades. You&#x27;d think by now that they&#x27;d have perfected one razor to the point where there wouldn&#x27;t need to be more features or anything. But of all the razors I&#x27;ve tried, I can honestly say that the ladies win with these ones from Bic. I highly recommend these over the Mach 3 or Mach 5, Schick Quattro, Fusion...any of that stuff. For me, the Soleil Triple Blade razors are not only very sturdy, but they last a while, and get the job done perfectly. With a razor that uses cartridges, every now and then the cartridge pops off, even during mid-shave. I&#x27;ve yet to have a single problem with these babies, and whenever I go buy new razors, I immediately pick up a pack of these, and THEN see what they&#x27;ve thrown at us guys now just to see if we&#x27;ve gotten a razor with 10 blades yet (come on, it&#x27;s bound to happen).  Some people say that the razors take off skin and pull hair too much. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve just been conditioned to shaving so much over the years or what, but I&#x27;ve used this shaver on tons of places. Usually it&#x27;s the front of my neck and the mustache area every 3-4 days, and underarms every 3-5 days, but I&#x27;ve also used this on my entire arms, hands, ears, chest, stomach, shoulders, back, toes, and the no-no zone. That&#x27;s making me sound like some kind of overly-hairy freak, but when it comes down to it, I just plain don&#x27;t like hair. I only shave my arms once every couple of months with this razor, and it doesn&#x27;t get dull at all when I&#x27;m done. Typically I&#x27;ll just use a regular bar of soap to lather up with before I shave, and it works just fine. When I shave in the shower, I do a stroke or two, then rinse the front and back of the razor, then keep going. Very rarely does hair build up in this razor, and that&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t say about some of the more expensive men&#x27;s razors.  What else is there to say? As odd as it might sound from a guy, this razor is a must in your bathroom. The only times I&#x27;ve cut myself with it were because it was my own fault and I pressed down too hard or went sideways for a split second. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a few years now, and it&#x27;s never let me down. The only negative would be that they&#x27;re disposable, but hey, you&#x27;re spending much less than you would for cartridges for some of the big names.</li>
    <li> I am very surprised at the negative feedback for these razors. My sister and I have been using these razors for a while and have nothing but good things to say about them. The razor gives a nice close shave unlike what I have had with venus, intuition, etc. Those razors have such a thick moisture bar that it is impossible to get a good shave. Overall, I am very satisfied with this razor and will use it for as long as they continue to make it. If you want a good close shave minus the irritation that cheaper razor may give you, I definitely would suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I had to review this because of all the poor reviews I have read today.  I have been using this razor for years!!!  And will not use anything else.  This is the sharpest razor you will ever find.  It takes a long time to dull so it is well worth the money.  And it has a great comfortable feel in your hand.     The razor is SHARP...if you don&#x27;t respect it you are going to get cut.  If you are used to DULL razors you will get cut.  Please don&#x27;t be dumb and review this as a poor razor because of operator error.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and just happened upon it while searching for other things on Amazon. I&#x27;m really surprised at the horrible reviews, as I love this razor.  It is sharp, but I get an awesome, close shave, and I have never cut myself (I use Dove soap to lather with).  I hope they never stop making this razor!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors since they entered the market and have never had any bloody incidents (save the rare shaving too quickly nick around the ankle or back of the knee).  I came to amazon to see if I could find a great deal on these (not a great deal, BTW, just about the same price I&#x27;d pay at CVS, but they&#x27;re delivered for free and I don&#x27;t have to wait for a sale) and was flummoxed by the poor reviews.  I&#x27;d just tried the CVS generic brand because they were BOGO and I&#x27;m literally throwing them out.  They&#x27;re that bad. It just reaffirmed how great these razors are.    Just to further illustrate how great these are, I shave w/just water...no shaving cream, no soap, and I have had no issues w/these razors, EVEN when I&#x27;m using them well past the point I should have thrown them away.  There&#x27;s not much more to say....great razor for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This razor was horrible.  It sliced my legs up like crazy and caused major razor bumps, even when labeled for sensitive skin.  I didn&#x27;t think it was just me... The Schick Quattro/Extreme 3 or Venus or Gilette razors never cause the same problems.  Even the cheap, no brand name disposables are gentler on the legs than these.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but I won&#x27;t hesitate to say: When it comes to buying Bic, stick to ball point pens, becuase their razors are worthless.  Want a good razor? Use the Schick Quattro or Extreme 3.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of these razors and used the first one...I actually thought my teenage son had sneakily used it without my knowing and put it back...so when I used it, it tore the legs of me.  I&#x27;m in the middle of laser hair removal (have very little hair left to shave) and was apologising profusely to the beautician for the hacks on my legs!  And it took weeks for the pins to recover.  So, I binned the blade and used a BRAND NEW ONE for the next shave.  I&#x27;m sitting again with legs hacked!!!  I thought, stupidly, that it was my fault for using cheap shaving foam so switched to my son&#x27;s expensive one, shaved really slowly and carefully etc, still have legs hacked!  Especially my feet and lower legs, not so much on my heavier thighs.  DO NOT BUY THESE RAZORS, THEY ARE THE WORST I HAVE EVER TRIED IN OVER 30 YEARS OF SHAVING!.</li>
    <li> I recently noticed that Bic introduced it&#x27;s new line of womens razors called, \\&quot;Soleil Triple Blade\\&quot;. I bought them because of the sale price. I used the first one &amp; before I knew it, it sliced a 2\\&quot; chunk out of my leg. I&#x27;m 34 years old, a veteran shaver. I was (&amp; still am) in pain. The razor sliced me open like a cheese knife. I&#x27;ll have a scar for life. I&#x27;ve written to Bic w/o response. Do not buy! I repeat, DO NOT BUY BIC SOLEIL! I currently use GILLETTE VENUS.</li>
    <li> I have been using these razors for a while now, and I have not had any problems. I only had a small cut from them once. They last a long time and don&#x27;t need to be replaced too often. My husband even steals one now and then and he has no problems shaving with it.</li>
    <li> they&#x27;ll only want more!  These razors are ghastly.  I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs for decades, I&#x27;m always very careful, but no matter what I did, these things left a trail of nicks and cuts across my calves and thighs.  These razors feel rough against the skin, it&#x27;s like shaving with a handsaw coated in sandpaper.  Honestly, they are the worst razors I have ever used.  Like the other women who have reviewed these skin wreckers, I&#x27;m going back to Gillette&#x27;s Venus razors.  Stay away, stay away, you&#x27;ll only end up using a whole box of band-aids to cover the gashes in your legs.</li>
    <li> These razors are surprisingly good for disposables, and very cost-effective when purchased through Amazon subscribe and save. 4 stars out of 5 because I wish they weren&#x27;t disposable--more plastic waste is bad for the environment &#x3D;( but I&#x27;ve bought all sorts of non-disposable razors, from &#x27;fancy&#x27; to &#x27;not fancy,&#x27; and none have been as good.     Also, there are pretty colors. Tired of orange? Have a yellow! An orange-red! A yellow-orange! This is exciting to me, because my time in the shower is otherwise pretty boring.    EDIT: I am giving them 5 stars again because, thanks to Amazon, I know that they actually do have a refillable system. YES! Also, if these cut your legs, maybe your legs just can&#x27;t withstand how awesome these are.</li>
    <li> They will get rid of the hair, but that&#x27;s about the only good thing they will do. They obviously tried to make the product have an appealing design, but they are cheap and become dull very quickly. They made my hair follicles actually bleed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this style of razor for a year now and have not had any issues at all! It gets a great close shave and I dont have any problems like some of the other razors. Knowing how to use them will show you they are the BEST disposable razor you can buy!!!!</li>
    <li> This razor was awful.  It cut my legs up into hamburger.  Do not buy it, BIC should stick to pens.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I CUT MY UNDERARM VERY BADLY AND THEY WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE A PROBLEM WITH THIS RAZOR!!!  BEWARE.....</li>
    <li> I bought these razors mostly because they were cheap and had 3 blades. I figured the more blades the better, because that&#x27;s usually the case. However, with these razors, I had to bear my way through every use, and now I&#x27;ve given up on them completely. They shredded my legs to bits. I never get nicks with other razors, but with these, I can&#x27;t shave my knees without at least 4 or 5 nicks. They gave me the worst razor burn and dried out my skin. You may think you&#x27;re saving money with these bargain razors, but really, you&#x27;re wasting it because you&#x27;ll want to throw them away after one use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs with a manual razor for decades. I usually use Gillette Daisy, a cheap razor that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with. However, I found an extremely amazing deal on Bic Soleils, and ended up buying 3 packs of them. Even though I shave carefully, and haven&#x27;t cut myself in eons, the first time I used the Soleil, I got cut. I chalked it up as a fluke. But as I continued to use the razors, they continued to nick and cut me, sometimes very badly. I began to wonder if the product itself was faulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I did a search for \\&quot;Bic Soleil Reviews\\&quot; and came across Amazon&#x27;s reviews, which had other people experiencing the same cuts as I have! It puzzled me however, to see that some people gave the product rave reviews, and I pondered WHY.  It finally dawned on me that my cuts never occur on the one part of my leg that actually has a bit of fat on it. See, I have a super-thin build. We&#x27;re talking skin and bones on my arms and legs, to the point where it&#x27;s almost comical (chicken legs!)  However, one little section of my calf, and part of my thighs do have a bit meat on them, and I never get cut there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... this super-sharp razor is just simply not for thinner people. I&#x27;m willing to bet that most of the people who rated this product with one star have slight builds similar to mine. If you have even the slightest bit of bone showing (ie, knobby knees, bony ankles, sharp shin bones, etc) YOU WILL GET CUT. No matter how experienced you are or how careful you are, this razor will nick you at least once during a shaving session on a bony part, guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thin ladies, look to a different product for your shaving needs. The Soleil is NOT for bony people!</li>
    <li> I forgot to bring my Venus razor back home so I bought this cheap Bic razor in Target. It is cheap and I did not plan on spending 10 dollars for another razor. Worst decision ever! It said on the packet \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; and I have sensitive skin, that&#x27;s why I cannot use those hair removal spray products. Now I have razor bumps all over my legs and they are very itchy! My legs are scarred for life. I will not bother to give the rest of my razors for someone to try it because I don&#x27;t want this to happen to another person.</li>
    <li> I purchased this pack of razors-yes it was stupid-because of the pretty packaging.  I was not surprised. Yes, the razors are extremely sharp, but they don&#x27;t go dull fast!  I actually have to dull them up a bit before I use them on my underarms, but I have not had a single little cut so far. All other disposable razors work great the first time, then they are so dull they get thrown away. They also cut the crap out of my legs leaving little scabs everywhere, but these razors don&#x27;t. With this razor, I use it for about two weeks before even thinking about replacing it due to being too dull. Totally worth the money for me. But, I do like sharp razors! On the other hand, this would not be good if you had loose skin in any way, shape, form or fashion. Even if you are 12 years old and have young beautiful legs, if your skin is loose at all, it will cut you. Good luck with your decision!</li>
    <li> great buy.  i get this on the subscribe and save plan and find it an economical way to purchase.  don&#x27;t have to worry about running out and don&#x27;t have to pay any shipping.</li>
    <li> The first time I used these razors and stepped out of my shower dripping blood I thought perhaps it was just me.I mean, what do I know, I&#x27;ve only been shaving my legs for 22 years. Now I think it is one of two things: 1. the Bic Soleil Triple Blade Shavers are sentient and out for blood, or 2. the Bic company is purposefully producing razors that cut you so badly so perhaps they can wade through your trash and steal said razor in some lame attempt at Jurrasic Park like cloning. Well, not me, not anymore. I bought a pack of ten of these suckers, and after subjecting not only myself to them but my teenage daughers as well, I threw them out. I&#x27;ve lost enough blood (and skin) and will go back to another brand who does not seem hell bent on permanently maiming their customers.</li>
    <li> This is the first product review I have ever written and I feel I am forced to do so because this razor is so bad.  As I write this, my legs are dripping blood from 5 different cuts.  Now Let me assure you that I have been shaving my legs for 15 years and never before have I nicked myself more than once.  In fact before this razor, I think it has been years.  Please beware and do not buy!</li>
    <li> My wife just sliced open both legs and her bikini area, using three different brand new Bic Soleil razors right out of the package.  Her legs look like red constellations.  She&#x27;s 31, not new to the shaving game.  Do not buy this product.  Save a penny lose a pound (of flesh).</li>
    <li> I love this razor.  Yes, it&#x27;s sharp.  If you aren&#x27;t capable, it will cut you.  But I ge the smoothest shave and it lasts longer.  My hair grows really fast and this razor lets me shave every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.</li>
    <li> Did BIC bother to do any test runs of this product? If so, they would have easily determined that these razors leave something to be desired: namely, your own skin. After shaving with these razors, I have to wear jeans to conceal the carnage left behind (and after all, doesn&#x27;t that negate the original purpose of the horribly archaic practice of leg shaving?)! The worst thing about this product is the guilt-induced need to use every one, after paying the exorbitant price (my fault, truly - I was dazzled by the pretty packaging). Thank the lord I finally threw away the last of these monstrosities this morning. Now I&#x27;m off to impulse shop some bandaids.</li>
    <li> I am half surprised that these are a Bic product.  The fun design and inclusion of razor covers make these the best non-pivoting disposable razors I have used.  A word of caution when switching back to razors with non-pivoting head: go slow and easy on the area around ankles to avoid constant nicks.  After using these for two months, they will still bite around my ankles if I do not take extra time to be careful.  These razors have handles with rubber grips.  The three blades have a moisture strip above them, so the strip glides over areas right after the shave.  The strip can become gooey after the first couple uses.  After the moisture is gone, just use a shaving cream or gel.  The blades retain their sharpness for about a month when used every other day for legs and underarms.  I use a new razor when the dried up moisture strip begins to flake off the razor head.         Compared to the yellow Bic disposable razors I was introduced to during my early teens, and then avoided like the plague due to guaranteed nicks, these are a fair attempt to make me reconsider pricier brands with unnecessary \\&quot;improvements\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have been using these razors, and only these razors, for the past 2 years, maybe longer. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with all of the other reviews that say they got cuts or bumps from using these razors. Yes, they are very sharp when you get a new one out of the package, but that just means that the razor lasts for more than one shave.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviews on here, these razors are awful! Sharp - yes, so sharp they will cut you up for weeks! Seriously I cut myself with these for 2 weeks straight, it wasn&#x27;t one of those \\&quot;new razor\\&quot; deals that cuts the first time you use them. I used these on vacation over the summer, and couldn&#x27;t buy something else... They left several cuts over weeks! They also are not made to last, if you have any long hairs, they get trapped behind the blade and it gets clogged and needs to be thrown out very quickly. I guess this is why they are just disposable razors, but I will never buy these again. They are pretty, but that&#x27;s about it!!</li>
    <li> Oh baby, are the other reviewers on target or what.  This razor is the pits.  I didn&#x27;t have any of my usual razors on hand so I swiped one of my stepmom&#x27;s Bic Soleils from her pack.  It was brand new, totally unused, but totally made a mess out of my legs!  It left me with a constellation of tiny little nicks all over my legs that turned into a constellation of tiny little scabs, therefore my gams were undisplayable for some time after.  I did not shave especially quickly or carelessly, so this razor must really be of abysmal quality.  I should have stopped the second I noticed the damage it was doing, but I just had to keep going and finish the job so by the end I was all sliced up.  It all healed eventually, luckily, except for one deeper cut low on my left leg that has turned into a small slightly pitted scar, grrr!  And shaving scars take quite a while to fade.  I wrote a complaint to the Bicworld website and they sent me a coupon for a free pen product up to $5.99 in value.  At least they didn&#x27;t insult my intelligence by offering me more free Bic razors.  Since then I have discovered the Venus Divine and am thrilled with the results there.  I&#x27;ll never go the Bic route again.  Anyone else who has had a bad outcome from this baby should complain to the Bicworld site as well so maybe they&#x27;ll finally do something about these piss-poor garbage razor, like improve them or take them off the market.  That probably won&#x27;t happen though so heed my advice and don&#x27;t buy them.  If you want to go disposable, I think Schick SlimTwins work much better.  They&#x27;re still cheap but there&#x27;s much less chance of nicking.</li>
    <li> this razor is amazing. it has 3 blades and just WIPES the hair away from your body like a squee-gee! i&#x27;m of mediterrenean descent and have thick black wiry hair and this razor just makes the hair disappear like magic, even bikini hair! the best part is that the blades are spaced in a way so that hair doesnt get stuck between the blades. i read the other reviews that talk about nicks and cuts but i havent experienced this problem at all. i would say maybe they are holding the razor at a wrong angle or pressing too hard because maybe they were used to other razors before this. you really dont need to press this one too hard at all it is very sharp and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also like the colors and packaging. i really didnt expect such a feminine girly looking razor to work so good!</li>
    <li> The Bic Soleil triple blade has to be the WORST women&#x27;s shaver on the market. Even the simple two blade store brands I&#x27;ve purchased in the past NEVER did as much damage to my legs and nether regions as these did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had only purchased these because I was out of replacement blades for my Gilette Venus, and couldn&#x27;t afford to fork over the $20+ for a replacement pack, so I stopped at CVS and picked a 3 pack of Bic Soleil up. HUGE mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with a THICK conditioner layered on my skin, these shavers caused the biggest nicks ( think erasure head sized ), razor burns, and dry skin on my legs that I have ever encountered. I have come out of the shower with thick rivulets of blood streaming down my legs because of how badly these shavers have cut up my skin. And putting cocoa butter and coconut oil on afterwards did nothing to relieve the VERY painful razor burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy Bic Soliel shavers again. I&#x27;m going back to Gillette Venus. They&#x27;re more expensive, but they last MUST longer and they don&#x27;t tear up my skin. AND they have a moisturizing strip, which Bic Soliel does NOT.</li>
    <li> I really want to like these shavers, but I just can&#x27;t after what happened to me December 2008--I remember well--I was taking a nice hot bath and excited to use these colorful shavers. Just as I was shaving the side of my right leg, my hand slipped and down went the shaver straight down my leg. I was left with a horrible cut. Next thing I knew I jumped out of the bathtub, holding tight my calf and running to my mom&#x27;s room. After a bandage and reassurance that I was going to make it, I went back to my room afraid to ever pick a shaver up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bic is a great brand, I love their ink pens, but my skin is just too sensitive for their razors. Be careful gals!</li>
