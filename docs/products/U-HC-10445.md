<li> It leaves her curls soft and it does not weigh them down.</li>
<li> I have very long hair</li>

<li> Makes my dry hair look manageable and less frizzy.  </li>
<li> Holy cow!</li>

<li> I apply it to my damp hair and brush it through then add a little leave in conditioner to the ends of my hair.</li>
<li> I have thin curly hair that tends to be frizzy if not conditioned properly.  </li>
<li> Not too heavy, still don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday.</li>
<li> Spray a small amount on damp hair &amp; scrunch it in a bit.  </li>
<li> this product is very heavy.  </li>
<li> I have thick curly hair.</li>
<li> so now I just spray a very small amount in my palm, rub my hands together and just put it on the roots.</li>
<li> It seriously conditions hair and leaves it so shiny and helps with the humidity making my hair kink up.  </li>
<li> This product has been a game changer.  </li>
<li> Obsessed with this stuff.</li>

    <li> Amazing! My hair is naturally curly and gets tangled easy! This product does wonders for my hair, leaves my hair soft, tangle free and it even smells amazing! It was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I love the aerosol spray can. It is a very nice leave in conditioner, helped me work through my tangles. (which can be miserable) Smells fresh, haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference as a thermal protectant but it&#x27;s a good leave in regardless. May be a bit overpriced for what you get.</li>

    <li> Love this leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist uses this on my hair I had to buy some! It is awesome!</li>
    <li> I needed something to get tangles out of my hair after I shower. This does the job very well. As an added bonus, it smells great. I&#x27;m happy I purchased this.</li>
    <li> this is the best leave in leave in conditioner I ever used....</li>
    <li> Holy cow! This product is simply AMAZING!!! I thought I would give it a try when ULTA had a B1G1 sale and I&#x27;m so happy I did! Almost 2 years later and I&#x27;m still using this product almost every night. Smells soooo good too! I have very long hair that&#x27;s almost to my butt and it gets dry from all the heat products I use on it and the hair color. I 110% recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Bought it at the salon and then they quit carrying it!  So glad I found it here on Amazon.  It seriously conditions hair and leaves it so shiny and helps with the humidity making my hair kink up.  I ran out and have to use something else until this comes in and believe me I can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I did see an improvement in my hair, it seemed shinnier thats about it. I did like the product but for the price I wouldn&#x27;t re purchase it.</li>
    <li> Nozzle always clogs up.</li>
    <li> In love with this product. I apply it to my damp hair and brush it through then add a little leave in conditioner to the ends of my hair. Makes my hair softer and I think it&#x27;s making it healthier too. Not too heavy, still don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday. Super good product.</li>
    <li> I have thin curly hair that tends to be frizzy if not conditioned properly.  This product has been a game changer.  Spray a small amount on damp hair &amp; scrunch it in a bit.  I then let it air dry &amp; my curls are more defined.</li>
    <li> Love at first use. I used it once and loved it. Protects my hair and leaves it smooth and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> this product is very heavy.  I recommended use before the shampoo to obtain better results.</li>
    <li> Pros: does what it say, soft and smooth hair, easy to spray. Best detangler ive used&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none! :-)</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner!</li>
