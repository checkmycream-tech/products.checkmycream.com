      <li>However i did use it all over my face and love how soft it made my skin</li>

      <li>I think my ruddy skin (red spots) is looking much better.  </li>
      <li>It feels really luxurious!</li>
      <li>it absorbed fast</li>
      <li>I plan on making some shea lotion in the near future and will probably be adding it to the mix just to give it that amazing coffee aroma</li>

      <li>Basically I made a list of all products needed in my regimen and tried to get natural replacements.</li>
      <li>Amazing subtle aroma of coffee!</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s a little too early to tell how much).  </li>
      <li>The smell is not overpowering, smells like coffee (as expected) but not overwhelming or strong.</li>
      <li>It really worked at eliminating the dark circles under my eyes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Misleading.  This is diluted coffee oil.  Go to Plant Therapy for 100% pure coffee oil.</li>
    <li> It really worked at eliminating the dark circles under my eyes. Getting my second order ready.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what the rave is about. The aroma is nothing like coffee. If it&#x27;s for skin only than it&#x27;s okay but I was looking for something  with a coffee aroma.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. I am 56 and I have only used it on my face and neck. My skin looks healthier. It has even toned down the red blotches I had on my cheeks. The wrinkles are not completely diminished but most of them are. I have only been using it for about 2 straight weeks and it has done wonders. It is certainly worth any money you pay for it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> smells just like coffee, and it&#x27;s good for my hair, my mother use to broil coffee and comb my hair with it to make, my hair soft and grow, great product for natural hair, and if you love coffee smell</li>
    <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s great to apply it on scratches or skin abrasions ( none opened wounds) it makes healing faster and leaves the skin without scar.</li>
    <li> I only used my product 2x and no results yet. i use it for under eye puffiness. However i did use it all over my face and love how soft it made my skin and it gave it a nice glow. Hopefully i see more results as i need my puffy eyes to diminish. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my cellulite, but now I also use it as a moisturizer (on my face) and it works well for both! I used this oil in conjunction with some cups that were supposed to help with cellulite and I actually noticed a difference! I also use this as a facial moisturizer and it absorbs into my skin so well. It feels really luxurious! My skin is naturally oily, so I&#x27;m amazed that my skin actually feels softer and less oily after putting on the coffee oil. Lastly, I also use it under my eyes. I don&#x27;t have a lot of puffiness, but I do have milia (pores clogged with oil--really hard to get rid of because they have no pore) and after using this under my eyes I noticed a reduction in the size of my milia. They are a bit smaller now, although they do seem to come and go with no real identifiable pattern. Overall, this product has many uses and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Lately, I have been noticing my few lines around my eyes. It does help make your skin moisturize. So happy about the results.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to see that this was not JUST essential oil in the bottle. It was already pre-diluted in jojoba oil. I can&#x27;t remember seeing that in the description so I feel jipped. The scent is perfect for my purpose and I was already going to mix it with jojoba and a couple other oils so...</li>
    <li> Hate to give this a bad review but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It&#x27;s very greasy.  Because of that i cannot use it as it broke me out on face.  Maybe it&#x27;ll be better for scalp and hair.  So not really a bad review, it just didn&#x27;t work for my particular complexion</li>
    <li> I think this product is actually helping with the bagginess under my eyes - if that is the case it will be the first thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that has helped (it&#x27;s a little too early to tell how much).  I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if the results continue...so far the improvement has been slight but and not noticeable by anyone else but I have noticed.  The smell is not overpowering, smells like coffee (as expected) but not overwhelming or strong. The way it dispenses is a little odd and it&#x27;s hard to get very much product out at a time, which is sort of annoying, but maybe it helps keep it from being wasted.</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel really good and moisturized.</li>
    <li> It makes my legs feel warm and a little tingly. I&#x27;m using it to get rid of the scars on my legs and after 2 days, I can see an improvement. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> It smells like coffee I like that,it didn&#x27;t do anything for my cellulite. I like it for my face it absorbed fast</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  It smells like coffee beans when you apply it but the aroma does fade.  It has worked wonders on my complexion.  I think my ruddy skin (red spots) is looking much better.  I use it in the morning prior to applying by foundation and my foundation glides on it and, I use a powder foundation!  I think you will enjoy this product very much.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to help with puffiness under my eyes.  I do think that it is helping.</li>
    <li> Great product...great price.</li>
    <li> I may have misread this products&#x27; description&#x27;. It is not pure and diluted with jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> little early to tell if it does anything at all. I have used it a few weeks, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, will keep using it as long as I have it. I might update if I notice an affect. sure makes me smell like coffee</li>
    <li> Not a very strong scent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently gone into the whole going natural and organic etc, and I have to say, it&#x27;s quite difficult getting those products without spending a lot of money. Basically I made a list of all products needed in my regimen and tried to get natural replacements. So essentially I use burts bees cleanser and toner(acne solutions), THEN after I dry my face i use this Arabica Coffee Seed Oil as a moisturiser. OH MY, this stuff works! i&#x27;ve always done my best to care for my face, but this natural oil, has done more for my face than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used(I&#x27;m a makeup artist who is always in search of better products). This oils reduces puffiness, redness, moisturises, locks in moisture AND does all this without any oily residue or feel to the skin. Pores aren&#x27;t clogged. To further  praise this product I haD improvements in my skin in just over 24 hrs. WILL NOT BE A WASTE!</li>
    <li> This is really good, i love the way it smells. Just like pure coffee seeds, the downfall is that the bottle is tiny and a bit pricey. But i do recommend it either way.  I use it for Cellulite on my legs along with Clarins anticellulite cream. It is a good product to add onto the cellulite cream.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It absorbs quickly without an oily residue.</li>
    <li> mixed with a carrier oil *****</li>
    <li> A nice oil that goes well in scrubs .. Wish it came in larger quantity .. I will order again , thanks</li>
    <li> I think it smells delicious but didnt notice a real difference in my face or the circles under my eyes. I switched to using safflower oil on my face because it has less of a chance of clogging my pores. however i looooove the smell of this stuff, i sometimes just open it to smell it. I plan on making some shea lotion in the near future and will probably be adding it to the mix just to give it that amazing coffee aroma</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure of this product yet.  I bought it for my puffy eyes and am still waiting for success.  You also need to like the smell of coffee.</li>
    <li> Good packaging! Amazing subtle aroma of coffee! Good quality</li>
