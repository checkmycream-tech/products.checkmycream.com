      <li>Great product, really does the job and leaves skin soft.</li>
      <li>So Thank you Amazon for having this product and the Shea Body Butter as well for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>That lucky man, I give him a head shave and foot rub</li>
      <li>All it does is layers you with an enormous amount of oil and honestly doesn&#x27;t even make you feel clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried to do-it-myself with kosher salt, almond oil, scents, but I just can&#x27;t get it right.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m re-ordering two jars of OBEY right now.  </li>
      <li>but It does make your skin feel very silky and makes you feel special after you use it.  </li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel super soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Just a few weeks after using this scrub on my legs daily, and my legs look the best they ever have!  </li>
      <li>I have found that the product I have ordered here on Amazon is of the same quality that I paid way more for at the mall.</li>
      <li>Skin is smooth and soft after use.</li>
      <li>OMG my Hands were soooooo soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different products.</li>
      <li>I have eczema and it just makes my skin feel clean, soft and smoothe.</li>
      <li>It smells good and it works really well but not long enough.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, but you can really feel the scrub working.</li>
      <li>Before purchasing this, I used Sugar scrub which is oil free, actually scrubs your skin, and leaves you feeling soft and clean.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I prefer the salt scrubs over sugar because it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as fast.  </li>
      <li>Haha.....</li>
      <li>It works good on hands but not too long on dry, cracked heels.</li>
      <li>It seems to be better than other brands I have used.</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft and lightly scented, terrific.  </li>

      <li>After it dries it does leave my skin feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hands feeling really soft!</li>
      <li>My skin feels amazingly soft with no dryness!</li>

      <li>I soon decided I was worth the money I spent on this product.  </li>
      <li>It rinses off nicely without a residue, and leaves just softness with a hint of smell behind.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure where to purchase it once returning home, but I went to the company web site and its pretty expensive to purchase direct.</li>
      <li>Really helps get rid of rough spots and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
      <li>but the jar is large so it will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>These two products last a long time in my opinion because you dont have to use much at all.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my skin so soft, especially my feet!</li>
      <li>I used this before and it was expensive, I found this on amazon and paying 1/2 price less than what I had paid before, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>this sure does work on my old tired wrinkly extremities!</li>
      <li>I use it every other day pretty much over my entite body and it will last at least 3 months.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it for exfoliating dead skin on my lower legs.  It seems to be better than other brands I have used.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face, arms, legs and feet.  Really helps get rid of rough spots and makes my skin feel soft.</li>
    <li> I have suffered for a long time with those little red bumps on the backs of my arms and tops of my legs that my dermatologist has diagnosed as keratosis pilaris. I have tried so many products to help keep it under control and nothing has worked like this.  I stumbled on this when a good looking young gentleman at the mall stopped me and rubbed it on my forearm. I paid quite a bit more money for it when I purchased it from him. When I use the scrub, I usually take a bath then stand up in the tub and pat myself somewhat dry with a towel. Then i just scrub a small amount over my legs, arms, bottom and stomach. I have very dry skin so this does not feel oily to me at all. After I get out of the bath I use the obey your body Shea nut body butter. These two products last a long time in my opinion because you dont have to use much at all.  I use it every other day pretty much over my entite body and it will last at least 3 months.  I have found that the product I have ordered here on Amazon is of the same quality that I paid way more for at the mall. Very happy with this product and now even happier I can order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Obey Your Body Product was named correctly.  This exfoliates dead skin and penetrates all 7 layers.  Leaves body silky smooth and squeaky clean.  I plan on never running out.  I recommend everyone to stay stocked up with this product.  I love this and it smells good, too.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VXQOBA Obey Your Body Dead Sea Salt Scrub Treatment Exfoliating Purity]]I love the Sea Salt Scrub, I first purchased this product while on vacation in Puerto Rico, fell in love with it. It turns your skin into silk. Wasn&#x27;t sure where to purchase it once returning home, but I went to the company web site and its pretty expensive to purchase direct. Anyway if you love pampering your skin, I think you will love this product.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC!  Best price I found was on Amazon.  Will purchase again and one for a friend.</li>
    <li> The product is too oily. After using it you have to use soap to remove it and as a result skin becomes dry.   Plus - smell really good and seems to be natural.</li>
    <li> Bought this before and knew I would love it.</li>
    <li> This is a good item. I used this before and it was expensive, I found this on amazon and paying 1/2 price less than what I had paid before, so I&#x27;m happy with it. It&#x27;s really work, keep your body nice and smooth, I also love this scent, it&#x27;s very light, the kiwi scent is very nice too, I had the lotion and my husband love it too</li>
    <li> Too greasy. I like a salt scrub that washes off entirely, this stuff leaves a scented residue. Ladies probably like that, but Men typically don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The only thing about this product that works in its advantage is the scent. It smells so good, I can&#x27;t even explain what the aroma is. Besides that, this salt scrub is a dud. IT DOES NOT EXFOLIATE. All it does is layers you with an enormous amount of oil and honestly doesn&#x27;t even make you feel clean. The salt is dull in my opinion. Before purchasing this, I used Sugar scrub which is oil free, actually scrubs your skin, and leaves you feeling soft and clean. Additionally the smell is just amazing. I will go back to using Tree Hut&#x27;s sugar scrub because it actually gets the job done. No more oil-filled salt scrub.</li>
    <li> I need to have smooth hands for needlework that I do.  Otherwise the threads catch on minute breaks in my skin. I have tried many different products. This one is fantastic.  And it leaves the hands smooth, as if I had put on hand lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this body scrub. It leaves my skin so soft, especially my feet! It&#x27;s very gentle, but you can really feel the scrub working.</li>
    <li> The exfoliating ability is wonderful and you don&#x27;t wind up with a hand full of oil. I sent a jar to my daughter that has a strong loyalty to another brand of scrub. She now only wants the Obey Your Body brand. There is very little oil in the jar. This allows the salts to stay on your skin without sliding off before you get a chance to scrub.</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris and have been embarrassed by the bumps on my legs for most of my life. Just a few weeks after using this scrub on my legs daily, and my legs look the best they ever have!  I only need to use a little bit so the jar really lasts a long time.  The fragrance is really nice too. It&#x27;s refreshing and not overpowering. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really greasy when you use it in the shower, so make sure not to slip on whatever drains onto the tub floor! After it dries it does leave my skin feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some stubborn dry skin and callouses on my feet. It definitely is helping. Yesterday, I decided to use on my body after being in the sun. My skin feels amazingly soft with no dryness!</li>
    <li> Its great. Exfolliates while it hydrates. Skin is smooth and soft after use. No pungent odor.Have tried multiple brands and flavors, this is the best. I use it almost daily.</li>
    <li> I like this product and will be ordering more.  I have eczema and it just makes my skin feel clean, soft and smoothe.</li>
    <li> I have tried several scrubs recently and have not really been satisified. I purchased the Obey your Body and love it. It leaves my hands feeling really soft!</li>
    <li> This is very good, my skin felt soft after using it. It leaves like a trail of moisture behind it, it&#x27;s not grimy feeling at all, it is like baby oil on your skin. Worth it!</li>
    <li> I first had the opportunity to get stopped in the mall to try the product and did get talked into buying it at an outrageous cost but It does make your skin feel very silky and makes you feel special after you use it.  I soon decided I was worth the money I spent on this product.  But after using it sparingly I found that I wanted more and wanted to see if I could buy it a bit cheaper then what I paid for it initially.  So Thank you Amazon for having this product and the Shea Body Butter as well for a much more reasonable price.  I completely recommend this to anyone that just wants their skin to feel silky soft.  I have made other member of my family fans of these products.</li>
    <li> It smells good and it works really well but not long enough. It works good on hands but not too long on dry, cracked heels.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing i find that helps with my eczema. Once i get an outbreak i use this every other day and it helps to dry it up and disappear, along with the tanning bed once a week.</li>
    <li> Product if fantastic, great for moisturizing and excellent for making your skin feel like silk.  Products if excellent, and I would recommend to anyone to use.</li>
    <li> This body scrub is wonderful on several levels. It is a powerful exfoliant- nice and grainy, but it might be a bit irritating for very sensitive skin. It smells beautiful, without being perfumey or overpowering. Just a nice, clean smell. Additionally, it does not leave you feeling oily or greasy as some scrubs do. It rinses off nicely without a residue, and leaves just softness with a hint of smell behind. I also didn&#x27;t find that it made the floor of my shower a mess, everything rinsed right down the drain without leaving a slippery, greasy puddle. I will definitely be re-ordering!</li>
    <li> Saw a similar product at a mall and not wanting to get ripped of, I purchased this item from Amazon. Granted, it is not the same brand so perhaps it may be unfair to compare. However, the description of the product as well as source materials are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why does it leave my hands so dry? This exfoliate works in that yes, it removes dry skin from your hands. Unfortunately, it also removes moisture. It&#x27;s a bit like lip balm, the more you use it, the more you need it.</li>
    <li> That lucky man, I give him a head shave and foot rub every Saturday morning, when our kitchen becomes a barber shop.  He runs twice a day and had nasty thick callouses that bothered him, cracked, all that.  Since I started sharing my salt scrub with him every week, those callouses have truly disappeared, no more cracks, feet moisturized.  Pleasant aroma, not too strong.  Happy man.  I think he is also turned on by me washing his feet.  Yes, dear.  It&#x27;s expensive.  I&#x27;ve tried to do-it-myself with kosher salt, almond oil, scents, but I just can&#x27;t get it right.  Another brand from San Francisco is a little less expensive and almost as good, but too oily and not enough scrub to the grain.  I&#x27;m re-ordering two jars of OBEY right now.  Don&#x27;t buy this stuff at the mall kiosk&#x27;s, they&#x27;ll rob you blind.  PS  I&#x27;ve started to use it in my bath at husband&#x27;s request.  My skin is so soft and lightly scented, terrific.  Be a little careful not to slip in the tub getting out.</li>
    <li> yeah, she loves it.  and i love applying it.  this stuff is the best. make sure you stir it up first as the wax is all at the top after shipping.</li>
    <li> This is gentle, yet effective.  The salt grains are very small so it is not as abrasive feeling on my skin.  No sticky mess in my bath after.</li>
    <li> this sure does work on my old tired wrinkly extremities! Leaves my skin lovely and soft &amp; smooth - just wish it would stay that way a bit longer!</li>
    <li> Great body exfoliator! Makes my skin feel super soft and smooth. You can honestly use it all over about once or twice a week. Such a difference!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin silky smooth. Gives that wholesome look. Will probably use this product for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Great product, really does the job and leaves skin soft.</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this scrub and I tested it by washing my hands... OMG my Hands were soooooo soft and smooth. She paid a lot of money at the mall where she purchased it from. Haha..... I am always looking for great deals and AMAZON price can&#x27;t be beat!! This scrub has been my go to for my hands, feet, and body. My skin is very dry and rough during the winter months and this product help within minutes. THIS IS A MUST BUY... I PROMISE YOU WILL LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> favorite stuff ive ever had !</li>
    <li> This Salt Scrub works better than anything I have ever used.  It has oil in it leaves your skin feeling moisturized.  I use it about three times a week but the jar is large so it will last a long time.  I reccomend all the products of Obey Your Body that I have used.  I am one happy customer.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product.  I prefer the salt scrubs over sugar because it doesn&#x27;t dissolve as fast.  This product also smells wonderful.</li>
