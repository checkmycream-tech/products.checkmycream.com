      <li>Good product when used with XFusion Hair Fiber</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good but any hairspray will do.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the spray for hair fibers put out by Toppik</li>
      <li>Really good product.</li>

      <li>The best product is light and helps the XFusion fibers do their job of making your thinning hair look full again!!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I tried cleaning with warm water and still it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>

      <li>Does a nice job of holding the hair.  </li>
      <li>I have used it for years and have always appreciated the most wonderful results I get each time I use</li>
      <li>Honest to God, hairspray works better...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, works great, I just wish it didn&#x27;t have such a repulsive smell!</li>
      <li>I have a major confidence boost as the crown of hair is gone and this spray product along with hair color works perfectly in 2 minutes, once I got the hang of it.</li>
      <li>and I see a huge difference!</li>
      <li>Makes me feel more &amp;#34;secure&amp;#34; that everything will stay in place.</li>
      <li>This stuff holds the keratin fibers better than anything else on the market.  </li>
      <li>OKAY</li>
      <li>Hair spray is a better substitute.</li>
      <li>this spray holds the fusion fibers in place better than any spray I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I find that using it on top of thr Toppik Fiber, I do not need to re spray.</li>
      <li>This product is ok, but you can use the fibers without the spray or with hairspray.  </li>
      <li>so it makes the product look more unnatural.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it cause it don&#x27;t hold...may be ok for someone else, not me</li>
      <li>Spray mechanism is better than what Toppik Sells...</li>
      <li>I have been nothing but pleased with Xfusion and the fiberhold spray.  </li>
      <li>IT&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>If I could get the company to send me a new sprayer top I could review the spray as I have been using Xfusion for years and have been generally happy with them.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it works great!</li>
      <li>have learned over the years that getting a shade lighter of the hair color (for me) or other people who mix 2 colors works the best.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and is durable through the day.</li>
      <li>My product was  shipped very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Hair spray works just fine.</li>
      <li>quick!</li>
      <li>Excellent product even with a little bit of spraying.</li>
      <li>The fibers work great without this extra hold spray.</li>
      <li>ok but has too strong an odor when first sprayed.</li>
      <li>so I would spray very little and hope for the best.  </li>
      <li>I will say that they do not look as authentic as they did when I first put them on</li>
      <li>I  more than willing to buy it again.</li>
      <li>I love it and highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth getting this product because you lightly spray it&lt;br</li>
      <li>similar to a volume hair spray - its a good product -- not sure any better than a good quality volumizing spray</li>
      <li>I CAN&#x27;T buy a new spray top for this, nor should I have to.</li>
      <li>My husband noticed the difference right away.  </li>
      <li>right after you use your building fibers.</li>
      <li>The Xfusion will stay right on your hair without it.  </li>
      <li>and I was right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and spray types over the years and this is the most high end I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
      <li>When I bought my first X-Fusion, I was told I needed to get the X-Fusion Fiberhold Spray to keep it in place.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>It only if you add more fibers after you spray that makes for a funny build up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering can&#x27;t you just use regular hair spray, and you probably could.</li>
      <li>THIS DOES ANYTHING MUCH MORE THAN REGULAR HAIRSPRAY WOULD DO.</li>
      <li>I purchased this a couple years ago and after the first use the spray nozzle would not spray.</li>
      <li>(xfusion looks unbelievably real if your hair is the right color like mine</li>
      <li>Good idea for the X-Fusion line but not easy to apply.</li>
      <li>My wife had thinning hair and the product helps in her appearance very much, she is very satisfied, and the product is ample enough to last a lonmg time.</li>
      <li>It holds the hair in place and gives it a health more vibrant look and last all day.</li>
      <li>A family member uses the hair fibers to camouflage some pretty significant bald spots and will only use Toppik or X-Fusion..</li>
      <li>Regular hairspray seems to do just fine holding the fibers in place.</li>
      <li>i recommend getting this spray with the x-fusion which i really need and like.</li>
      <li>were is extensions start and my real hair ends.</li>
      <li>Makes it look so much fuller.</li>
      <li>your standard hairspray lightly applied will work in a pinch.</li>
      <li>I also have the spray top for fibers and after 6 years it&#x27;s worn out but that is expected.</li>
      <li>This spray really works well .</li>
      <li>not that anything really hold these fibers in place.  </li>
      <li>Works well in intense heat with sweating, wind, and rain.</li>
      <li>I will reorder and use this product as long as it is available.  </li>
      <li>If you have thin hair to the point where you start buying hair fiber powders (doesn&#x27;t matter which brand), you most likely also own a can or bottle of whatever brand of hairspray out there.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ordered this product and it seems to hold the hair fibers in place with no heavy or sticky residue.</li>
      <li>My only beef is I quickly discovered that I don&#x27;t even need the product.</li>
      <li>so humidity tends to be high 95% of the time.  </li>
      <li>I tried both products, X-Fusion, it really colors your scalp more than thicken your hair, sprayed it and when working in the yard, when it really warmed up outside, it ran down the sides of my scalp.</li>
      <li>I live in the Sunshine State</li>
      <li>I am going to buy a new one.</li>
      <li>and they are exactly the same.</li>
      <li>building fibers last much longer !</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the same stuff as toppik. A family member uses the hair fibers to camouflage some pretty significant bald spots and will only use Toppik or X-Fusion.. She uses the spray after she puts the fibers in her hair.  It helps to hold the hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared ingredients from both X-Fusion and Toppik and they are exactly the same.</li>
    <li> I tried both products, X-Fusion, it really colors your scalp more than thicken your hair, sprayed it and when working in the yard, when it really warmed up outside, it ran down the sides of my scalp.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and would recommend it to everyone. This product did what it says it will do for you.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and have always appreciated the most wonderful results I get each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of such a product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product even with a little bit of spraying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth getting this product because you lightly spray it&lt;br /&gt;on right after you use your building fibers. Then after it&lt;br /&gt;dries you can use your regular hairspray. It makes the jar&lt;br /&gt;of building fibers last much longer !</li>
    <li> My hairstylist has used both on me to stabilize the x-fusion powder. Otherwise you will see the residue on your pillowcase. In this case the fiberhold seemed to work the best, but if we are on a budget, and who isn&#x27;t? your standard hairspray lightly applied will work in a pinch.</li>
    <li> When I bought my first X-Fusion, I was told I needed to get the X-Fusion Fiberhold Spray to keep it in place. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering can&#x27;t you just use regular hair spray, and you probably could. But this spray is meant for this product and keeps it sticking where it needs to stay, with a firm hold, without a lot of build up. I&#x27;ve had great luck with it and yes, I probably could use plain old hair spray, but when I&#x27;ve found a system that works, why buck the system?</li>
    <li> A waste of money. This spray along with the powder just doesn&#x27;t make sense. This product is a sticky tacky mess.Noone with&lt;br /&gt;Any hair type will want this in or on their hair.Would not recommend.. Delivery on time.</li>
    <li> This spray really works well . It holds the hair in place and gives it a health more vibrant look and last all day.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job of holding the hair.  A firmer hold than shaper plus.</li>
    <li> ok but has too strong an odor when first sprayed.</li>
    <li> I like this product and it is cheaper that Toppik product and works just the same. I recommend to buy this product!</li>
    <li> It works however I found that regular hairspray does the same thing and much cheaper. It&#x27;s also a little heavy and when you have fine thin hair, extra weight is not a good thing.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Hold in fusion x.</li>
    <li> I have been nothing but pleased with Xfusion and the fiberhold spray.  Works well in intense heat with sweating, wind, and rain.</li>
    <li> Using this product didn&#x27;t help. The fibers work great without this extra hold spray. It made my hair wet &amp; sticky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this especially hold the product in place.  It smells and feels just like regular hairspray. In the future I won&#x27;t be getting the spray as I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s needed to make the fibers work.</li>
    <li> Hairspray works as well as this and it left my hair too wet.  I had curled my hair and it went right back to flat.  Barely used any!  Shipping was fast!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, works great, I just wish it didn&#x27;t have such a repulsive smell! I can&#x27;t explain the smells it&#x27;s just sweet and weird.. Other than that, it works great!</li>
    <li> I can not review the spray. I purchased this a couple years ago and after the first use the spray nozzle would not spray. I tried cleaning with warm water and still it doesn&#x27;t work. If I could get the company to send me a new sprayer top I could review the spray as I have been using Xfusion for years and have been generally happy with them. I also have the spray top for fibers and after 6 years it&#x27;s worn out but that is expected. I am going to buy a new one. I CAN&#x27;T buy a new spray top for this, nor should I have to. Beware of defective sprayers.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this product.  I think ordinary hair spray of whatever brand would do a better job, less expensively.</li>
    <li> Really covered a slight thinning area that has always bothered me. Easy to apply and is durable through the day.</li>
    <li> What a difference this makes. I can sleep with the Hair fibers in my hair without any rubbing off on my pillow when I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret is to do you CLEAN hair with the fibers, then and only then when you are completely done, spray this on all over then let t dry completely and for 5-10 minutes and nothing rubs. The secret is to use the spray as the last step - after you are completely satisfied with the hair fiber placement.  It only if you add more fibers after you spray that makes for a funny build up. But follow these instruction for best results</li>
    <li> similar to a volume hair spray - its a good product -- not sure any better than a good quality volumizing spray</li>
    <li> spray liquid...prefer aerosol... it wets your head therefore, it makes the powder run...I would improve it</li>
    <li> Product delivers as promised.  It binds the toppik fiber cover extremely well and prevents , in my case, dark brown from coming off.  I find that using it on top of thr Toppik Fiber, I do not need to re spray.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I always use it when my roots begin to show along with the colored powder. I love it.</li>
    <li> This product is ok, but you can use the fibers without the spray or with hairspray.  I would recommend just the fibers.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product because I did not like the smell and it was messy and I had to apply it daily.</li>
    <li> The best product is light and helps the XFusion fibers do their job of making your thinning hair look full again!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but any hairspray will do. I prefer aerosol hair spray and this is a pump. But it works</li>
    <li> I use this to set the fibers correctly. Made mistake of using regular hairspray 1 time and it was &amp;#34;matted&amp;#34;. There is no similar product as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> Spray mechanism is better than what Toppik Sells...</li>
    <li> This helps keep the hair fibers in place. It also doubles as a hair spray to keep your hair in place.</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  It is a great product.  I will reorder and use this product as long as it is available.  It thickens your hair and stays in until you wash it.  Really good product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ordered this product and it seems to hold the hair fibers in place with no heavy or sticky residue. I use around 4 short pumps per application, yet I don&#x27;t even notice it on my hair (maybe I am not spraying enough???). If anyone else has any feedback on this, shoot me a message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the bottle leaks when it is in my bag, hence the big downgrade in rating. I would have expected a leak-proof bottle for such a product especially since I assume that many people will carry this in their briefcase, gym bag, carry-on, etc..</li>
    <li> My husband loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Don’t waste your money! Hair spray works just fine.</li>
    <li> I use this with the XFusion powder for my thinning hair.  My husband noticed the difference right away.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product if you have thinning hair! I use it all the time and I see a huge difference! Great transcation too....quick!</li>
    <li> I also like the smell</li>
    <li> does the job! Keeps the Keratin fibers in place, and you only need a few spritzes</li>
    <li> MAKES MY HAIR A LITTLE STIFF AND DRY BUT KEEPS THE FIBER LONGER TIME ON YOUR SCALP ,DON&#x27;T THINK IT&#x27;S NECESARY</li>
    <li> Good idea for the X-Fusion line but not easy to apply.</li>
    <li> this will hold hair in a tornado .....I prefer to use other hair spray</li>
    <li> I bought this spray along with XFusion organic hair color powder and the combination works like a charm. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and spray types over the years and this is the most high end I&#x27;ve used yet. I have a major confidence boost as the crown of hair is gone and this spray product along with hair color works perfectly in 2 minutes, once I got the hang of it. Together they fill in my bald spot and thickens the area just the way I want it. The hair spray lasts a long time for me, as a little spray goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned over the years that getting a shade lighter of the hair color (for me) or other people who mix 2 colors works the best.</li>
    <li> I have long straight blonde hair, pretty thick, yet fine.  I live in the Sunshine State so humidity tends to be high 95% of the time.  I hate the sticky/stiff feeling of hairsprays so I would spray very little and hope for the best.  Needless to say, my hair would not stay in place and end up flat on my head.  That is UNTIL I found this product!! You spray very little, it&#x27;s not sticky, and will keep hair in place all day. I love it and highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> It works like a hair spray and seems to keep everything on my head and connected to my hairs, I like it so far.</li>
    <li> This spray works well with xfusion product.  I have no complaints and would recommend this product.  Yada, yada, yada and yada.</li>
    <li> This product is designed to be used with X-Fusion to enhance your hair&#x27;s appearance and to function as a hairspray.  I will reorder.</li>
    <li> this spray holds the fusion fibers in place better than any spray I have ever used.  The product works well together</li>
    <li> OKAY - NOT SURE THIS DOES ANYTHING MUCH MORE THAN REGULAR HAIRSPRAY WOULD DO.</li>
    <li> This product works with the hair fibers and does what it is suppose to do!</li>
    <li> It works as promised. My only beef is I quickly discovered that I don&#x27;t even need the product. The hair fiber stays in place and does not require any extra hold. Regular hairspray would be sufficient. Other than that the product does hold if you feel the need to have extra protection.</li>
    <li> I feel this spritz was a waste of money. I tried it along with the keratin fibers and it made my hair feel stiff. It did not hold and the fibers became patchy on my scalp. Im not using it anymor.</li>
    <li> Good product when used with XFusion Hair Fiber</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product  I have systemic Lupus and am loosing my hair  its terrible I bought this Powder and Its is great! Covers the bald spots  and lasts all day! Great value  cheaper than from the manufacturer</li>
    <li> If you have thin hair to the point where you start buying hair fiber powders (doesn&#x27;t matter which brand), you most likely also own a can or bottle of whatever brand of hairspray out there.&lt;br /&gt;Be it Aquanet to Aveda, Suave to Sebastian, just use the hair spray you have in your bathroom cabinet and forgo this X-Fusion Fiberhold Spray.</li>
    <li> Works well and  smells gois too!</li>
    <li> Great product. Does the job.  My product was  shipped very quickly.  Xfusion does wonders for my thinning hair.  Makes it look so much fuller. The spray does a great job of keeping the fibers on my head.</li>
    <li> With a little push, this holds hair all day long.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this purchase.</li>
    <li> used and love this product a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> great product i dont need additional hairspray it sets the powder gives me volume but its not sticky. i recommend getting this spray with the x-fusion which i really need and like. you only need a small amount so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;s ok. Producy suggested by hairdresser in the states, received in time at the adress noted on the order in Stamford Connecticut</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to work any different than hair spray.</li>
    <li> If you think you can use any type of hair spray to lock in the X Fusion, think again.  This stuff holds the keratin fibers better than anything else on the market.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hairspray. It holds the shape and smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Hair spray is a better substitute. I don&#x27;t know why I bought this stuff because I knew it was just glorified hair spray and I was right.</li>
    <li> This does do a good job of holding the fibers in place.  However, it is mostly alcohol which is very bad for the hair.  If you&#x27;re already having problems with thinning or missing hair, you don&#x27;t want to damage what is left.  It is drying and leaves your hair fairly stiff and takes away natural shine so it makes the product look more unnatural.  I would recommend just using hairspray instead of this (alcohol-free if you can get it).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it cause it don&#x27;t hold...may be ok for someone else, not me</li>
    <li> great product....no complaints</li>
    <li> I use it, but not really sure that it makes a difference.I think you could probably set the powder with any hair spray.</li>
    <li> Dries out my hair. Regular hairspray seems to do just fine holding the fibers in place.</li>
    <li> Honest to God, hairspray works better...not that anything really hold these fibers in place.  Just pray it does not rain.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  You don&#x27;t need it.  The Xfusion will stay right on your hair without it.  It&#x27;s sticky like molasses and or varnish.</li>
    <li> SIMILAR TO HAIR SPRAY...BUT DOES THE JOB OF KEEPING THE FIBERS IN PLACE.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT TO THE X-FUSION CUSTOMERS.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective.  I have some issues with thining hair and I use extensions. When this product used with the Xfusion color you can&#x27;t tell at all were is extensions start and my real hair ends.And my hair is actually growing. So, My hairstylist and I think it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
    <li> This product did not perform any better or worse than other hair sprays. was nice that it was unscented and not perfume like.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I put it on 3 days ago (today is evening of day 3) and went on a hiking trip. I didn&#x27;t shower for 2 days, walked through rain, sweat like crazy walking a total of 12 miles, and The fibers are STILL THERE. I will say that they do not look as authentic as they did when I first put them on (xfusion looks unbelievably real if your hair is the right color like mine is) but after what I went through this past weekend with this stuff on my head I  more than willing to buy it again.</li>
    <li> My wife had thinning hair and the product helps in her appearance very much, she is very satisfied, and the product is ample enough to last a lonmg time.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product holds hair fibers in place without being too heavy or sticky. It just takes one tiny spray or two and the bottle lasts over a month.</li>
    <li> It does what it should, even though all hairspray get the job done I still be this. Makes me feel more &amp;#34;secure&amp;#34; that everything will stay in place.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the spray for hair fibers put out by Toppik</li>
