      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve found Mitchum to be the best deodorant on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is very light.</li>
      <li>Strong and will not leave under arms sore or lumpy.  </li>
      <li>If your looking for a true product</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite (and only) deodorant for many years; it works, doesn&#x27;t make a streaky mess all over your clothing, dries quickly and has a mild, pleasant scent.  </li>
      <li>The shipping from this vendor is Pretty pricy!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
      <li>unlike it&#x27;s cousins you will have to fresh n up before the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>This is a very effective deodorant - easy to use, does not stain clothing, dries quickly &amp; is long lasting.</li>
      <li>This product is superior to any other product of its kind for those who need a deodorant to be &#x27;dry&#x27; all day!  </li>
      <li>Great product and hard to find.</li>
      <li>The smell is light and soft.</li>
      <li>This is so difficult to find in stores-pharmacies anymore, it is a great anti-perspirant for anyone who has wetness, perspiration issues, etc.  </li>
      <li>I guess I will be looking for a new go-</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant, I doesn&#x27;t leave any white stains under my arm pits like other deodorants.</li>
      <li>DOes not smell as nice as other deodorants but works extremely well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a 5-star deodorant in less than stellar packaging.</li>

    <li> This lasts and lasts.  Even the bottle lasts a long while!  DOes not smell as nice as other deodorants but works extremely well.</li>

    <li> great antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> If you see this in store grab them all! Really hard to find but it&#x27;s the best on the market keeps me dry. When I run out I try something else (product junkie) and it never works! I usually grab about 4 at a time. The smell is light and soft. My all time favorite! Please don&#x27;t change or go away!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was such a thing as &#x27;Dry&#x27; roll-on!  It&#x27;s a nice upgrade.</li>

    <li> This deodorant is very difficult to find and my favorite..</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite (and only) deodorant for many years; it works, doesn&#x27;t make a streaky mess all over your clothing, dries quickly and has a mild, pleasant scent.  HOWEVER, my last several purchases the roller ball didn&#x27;t work.  Extremely annoying.  I wonder if this is why they discontinued it.  I guess I will be looking for a new go-to roll-on (I won&#x27;t use those sticks and gels that leave white streaks everywhere, no matter how well they work).  I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s a 5-star deodorant in less than stellar packaging.</li>
    <li> This item is listed as the Lady Mitchum Dry Roll-on.... But it is not what I received!  It&#x27;s the regular roll-on... I could have purchased it in any drug store.  I ordered this because the DRY ROLL-ON is difficult to find..... So disappointed!</li>
    <li> Rollerball does not work at all so product is useless.</li>
    <li> Great buy, packaged well. reasonably priced, when it is hard to find in my area. I like the quanity it came in.</li>
