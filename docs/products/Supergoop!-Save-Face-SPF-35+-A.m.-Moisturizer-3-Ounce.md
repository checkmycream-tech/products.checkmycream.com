<ol>
      <li>my face and hands and gives me excellent protection against the sun.</li>
      <li>will be great for summer.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me shiny, and the coverage seems just as good.</li>
      <li>I got this one and love it!  </li>
      <li>I liked the texture fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, provides excellent sun protection, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive, rosacea skin.</li>
      <li>( I like it because I like this kind of sunblock :)</li>
      <li>This lotion is a great solution for a daily moisturizer with good SPF.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I use this every morning (on top of a serum).</li>
      <li>Love that its water resistant.</li>
      <li>I found this a year ago at an upscale drugstore (it costs more there than it does here on Amazon) and tried it on a whim.  </li>
      <li>I have used this products for a long time, and I am very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this to use for activity use because I wasn&#x27;t sure about products I can easily find around.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love the feeling that my skin is super shielded from the sun and super goop provides the nice healthy sheen that most sunblocks don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>super light and nice.  </li>
      <li>Super Goop is oil free and 35 SPF!</li>
      <li>I love my tinted moisturizer and add a layer of that after my super goop.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this sunscreen!</li>
      <li>Fortunately I can still use this on the rest of my body and it works well there</li>
      <li>Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen instead.</li>
      <li>it is not oily and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>This one fit the bill</li>
      <li>I like that it has a higher SPF than most moisturizers with SPF.</li>
      <li>So I wanted a sunscreen that is not thick and whitening but also effective, from the ewg website.  </li>
      <li>Again if you have dry skin and want a dewy look, that would probably be great, but to me it translates as oily rather than dewy, so I probably would not repurchase.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the kind of sticky feel of it, but I feel like this is the current state of the art in sunscreens.</li>
      <li>And so far, I can&#x27;t get the top off to use it, either!</li>
      <li>It is the right consistency and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It is light and offer the right amount of protection.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it work fine</li>
      <li>I love Supergoop because I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and have dark hair so sunscreen is a must.  </li>
      <li>item, first I met on Gwyneth paltrow&#x27;s blog-Goop as organic sunblock for all family.</li>
      <li>It barely has any scent to it, glides on easily, rubs in easily, and I only reapplied once over 4 hours at the beach.  </li>
      <li>Its much lighter and has twice the SPF protection.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing for all day</li>
      <li>I was looking for a sunscreen that is light and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my face - yet doesn&#x27;t contain oxybenzone.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
      <li>and it may work very well for others</li>
      <li>I already have moisturizers I like to use, so this is a good lightweight addition that wont make my face feel thick.  </li>
      <li>When you first put it on, it looks a bit white, but that goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>wanted something not expensive but still reliable for everyday use for running, and I love this!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad that this year there are sunscreens available like this one that use minerals and don&#x27;t make my already pale skin ghostly white like they all used to!  </li>
      <li>The smell, texture, etc., were fine, but I have incredibly sensitive skin and found my face red, burning when I touched it, and flaking after about three days of use.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a high quality moisturizer</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I like this stuff better than the Everyday sunscreen.</li>
      <li>If you have drier skin this product would probably be great, but for my slightly oily skin it just feels too heavy.</li>
      <li>While the lotion didn&#x27;t upset my very sensitive skin the dispenser didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>and I love it as a daily moisturizer with or without make-up and about half the cost.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for the high SPF (the moisturizer I had been using previously stopped being made in SPF30 and was only available in SPF15).</li>
      <li>Its a pit pricey compared to other options, but I have no complaints with this one, so its worth it for my skin and health.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first high SPF moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face look pale as a ghost</li>
      <li>I switched to Olay Daily Moisturizer Sensitive Skin SPF 30</li>
      <li>This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, irritate my sensitive skin, or make me break out.</li>
      <li>I had previously used their daily lotion which is lighter feeling, but this really has the consistency and feel of a regular sunblock.</li>

<li> My dermatologist is always after me to use a daytime moisturizer with a high SPF and I&#x27;ve tried about 5 or 6 different brands, but they always either went on with a white-ish cast and made my skin look unnaturally pale or got into my eyes and made them water or both.  </li>
<li> In the past I would use Neutrogina products but they left a noticeable white residue....not so with this sunscreen.  </li>
<li> It definitely has a sunscreen smell to it, but does dissipate after a little while.</li>
<li> No white residue on dark skin tones!</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s thick enough and sinks in quickly enough that it doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes.  </li>
<li> Not sure if it was old, but it had little flakey crystals that would show on my face upon application.</li>
<li> Not as oily as other brands.</li>
<li> I suppose that it was migrating down my face, even though i didn&#x27;t feel like I was sweating.&lt;br</li>
<li> Now My husband also likes it.&lt;br /&gt;However, If you are oily skin type You may need to think about it since it&#x27;s a little glowing?</li>
<li> A little research indicated it was probably the ingredient avobenzone that was causing that reaction.</li>
<li> Just be wary if you have sensitive skin!</li>
<li> so it won&#x27;t be wasted.</li>
<li> and it is one of the few brands that works for me and is also affordable.</li>
<li> but unfortunately it has some ingredient(s) that caused trouble for me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never experienced that before.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Ultimately, I gave it away because it was driving me crazy.</li>
<li> It was very uncomfortable and I had to wash it off.  </li>
<li> The nozzle doesn&#x27;t work at all. :(</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed because it&#x27;s well reviewed by the EWG.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This lotion is a great solution for a daily moisturizer with good SPF. It does not leave my skin feeling oily or chalky and it has not made me break out at all. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the high SPF (the moisturizer I had been using previously stopped being made in SPF30 and was only available in SPF15). The smell, texture, etc., were fine, but I have incredibly sensitive skin and found my face red, burning when I touched it, and flaking after about three days of use.

    <li> Very disappointed.  I was looking for a sunscreen that is light and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on my face - yet doesn&#x27;t contain oxybenzone.  This one fit the bill but unfortunately it has some ingredient(s) that caused trouble for me. I felt like I was breathing in something toxic.  It was very uncomfortable and I had to wash it off.  I&#x27;ve never experienced that before.  I really wanted this to work and it may work very well for others but I&#x27;m going to be continuing my search.  Fortunately I can still use this on the rest of my body and it works well there so it won&#x27;t be wasted.</li>
    <li> I am in the sun a lot during the summer and also my skin seems to be getting fairer over the years.  So I wanted a sunscreen that is not thick and whitening but also effective, from the ewg website.  I got this one and love it!  It barely has any scent to it, glides on easily, rubs in easily, and I only reapplied once over 4 hours at the beach.  Didnt burn A BIT!  I only put it on my face and shoulders.  I already have moisturizers I like to use, so this is a good lightweight addition that wont make my face feel thick.  Its a pit pricey compared to other options, but I have no complaints with this one, so its worth it for my skin and health.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff better than the Everyday sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t make me shiny, and the coverage seems just as good. When you first put it on, it looks a bit white, but that goes away quickly. I love Supergoop because I have sensitive skin and it is one of the few brands that works for me and is also affordable. Get your annual skin checks and wear Supergoop! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, irritate my sensitive skin, or make me break out. It&#x27;s not oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad that this year there are sunscreens available like this one that use minerals and don&#x27;t make my already pale skin ghostly white like they all used to!  I don&#x27;t love the kind of sticky feel of it, but I feel like this is the current state of the art in sunscreens. It&#x27;s also in the realm of affordable.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 4 tubes of this stuff and I love it. It&#x27;s moisturizing, provides excellent sun protection, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive, rosacea skin. Additionally, it does not burn my eyes. I like the ingredients and the price point. I think it&#x27;s a high quality moisturizer and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use for activity use because I wasn&#x27;t sure about products I can easily find around.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something not expensive but still reliable for everyday use for running, and I love this!&lt;br /&gt;This item, first I met on Gwyneth paltrow&#x27;s blog-Goop as organic sunblock for all family. Now My husband also likes it.&lt;br /&gt;However, If you are oily skin type You may need to think about it since it&#x27;s a little glowing? or greasy on me. ( I like it because I like this kind of sunblock :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years.  It is the right consistency and easy to apply.  I thought the name was funky, so I bought it.  Turned out to be what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I use this every morning (on top of a serum). It absorbs well into my face and neck. It definitely has a sunscreen smell to it, but does dissipate after a little while. I like that it has a higher SPF than most moisturizers with SPF.</li>
    <li> Super Goop is oil free and 35 SPF! I love my tinted moisturizer and add a layer of that after my super goop. I love the feeling that my skin is super shielded from the sun and super goop provides the nice healthy sheen that most sunblocks don&#x27;t. No white residue on dark skin tones!</li>
    <li> I have used this products for a long time, and I am very happy with it.  Supergoop mosturizes my face and hands and gives me excellent protection against the sun.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Not as oily as other brands. Love that its water resistant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this almost every day. it is not oily and goes on smoothly. super light and nice.  will be great for summer.</li>
    <li> This feels like sunblock. I had previously used their daily lotion which is lighter feeling, but this really has the consistency and feel of a regular sunblock. If you have drier skin this product would probably be great, but for my slightly oily skin it just feels too heavy. Also as another review had mentioned, it leaves a sheen on your face. Again if you have dry skin and want a dewy look, that would probably be great, but to me it translates as oily rather than dewy, so I probably would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> The nozzle doesn&#x27;t work at all. :( And so far, I can&#x27;t get the top off to use it, either!</li>
    <li> While the lotion didn&#x27;t upset my very sensitive skin the dispenser didn&#x27;t work. The first time I used it work fine but then the pump didn&#x27;t work and for that price it should. I switched to Olay Daily Moisturizer Sensitive Skin SPF 30 and I love it as a daily moisturizer with or without make-up and about half the cost.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist is always after me to use a daytime moisturizer with a high SPF and I&#x27;ve tried about 5 or 6 different brands, but they always either went on with a white-ish cast and made my skin look unnaturally pale or got into my eyes and made them water or both.  I found this a year ago at an upscale drugstore (it costs more there than it does here on Amazon) and tried it on a whim.  It works!  It&#x27;s the first high SPF moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face look pale as a ghost and it&#x27;s thick enough and sinks in quickly enough that it doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes.  It&#x27;s also very moisturizing for all day and I use it under makeup for that reason...even though I use makeup with a sunblock, I like the texture this gives my face before putting on my makeup, so I use both.  Considering how expensive so many day creams (with lower SPF) are, this is a steal.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen! I liked the texture fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it bothered my eyes. My vision got blurry every time I used it. I suppose that it was migrating down my face, even though i didn&#x27;t feel like I was sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I gave it away because it was driving me crazy. I&#x27;m disappointed because it&#x27;s well reviewed by the EWG.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it was old, but it had little flakey crystals that would show on my face upon application. I would recommend  La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen instead. Its much lighter and has twice the SPF protection.</li>
