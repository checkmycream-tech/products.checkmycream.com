    <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD A CHANCE TO USE ONE BUT I SENT ONE TO MY DAUGHTER IN FLORIDA AND SHE LOVED IT.  I EVEN RE-ORDERED MORE .  ONCE I ORDERED THEM, THEY ARRIVED WITHIN 3 DAYS.  VERY FAST.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I purchased it for my sister.  She is super excited and said its an amazing invention.  She is now able to get every last drop of her expensive lip gloss out of the container.</li>
    <li> Being a consultant dealing with various spa and beauty aids, Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand has been a true product saver!

I wasn&#x27;t expecting that so it was a great surprise! I spend a lot on my products so I wanna get my moneys worth and the Wand allows me to. Love it!</li>
    <li> No more having to throw out half used lip gloss tubes!! The flexibility of this wand gets all that hard to reach, expensive make up from those cosmetic containers. It ranks up there as one of the best inventions! Trying to use a Q-tip, bobby pins, etc. won&#x27;t get it...Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand will! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand does just what it says. At such a reasonable price, I brought 8 to give as presents to all my girls. I even gave one to my stylist. Great idea!</li>
    <li> This is the best investment I could have made for my makeup bag! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product as I hate wasting anything including makeup!</li>
    <li> Nothing irks me more than paying top dollar for good lip gloss only to throw it away with 20% left at the bottom of the tube hiding from me.  This tool pays for itself immediately and gets every last drop out of the container.  It makes a great gift...my girlfriends have loved it.  I ordered mine and got the order within 2 days with no hassle.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;beauty&#x27; of Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand as a useful product is that the applicator is so flexible to truly extract all the contents from the sides and bottom of varying shapes of containers.

    <li> I received my wand and started using it right away it is amazing. I don&#x27;t like to waste anything so I have been holding onto my almost empty lip gloss. I like my wand so much I am giving one to my entire bridal party!!!!</li>
    <li> Not as sturdy as I would have liked. I should have just used the stick they put in your coffee lid from Starbucks.</li>
    <li> These work GREAT!! I was able to completely clean my Mac lipglosses containers.  I need to buy more of these.  I&#x27;m DEFINITELY giving these as stocking suffers for the holidays and keeping them in my car and cosmetic case.  GREAT IDEA!</li>
    <li> This tool is by far my favorite cosmetic item.  I love cosmetics and hate wasting money.  The magic wand will help you get all the bang for your buck!  No more wasting what I thought was &#x27;a little lit&#x27; of gloss, lipstick, makeup.  Nikki&#x27;s magic wand will give you 5 - 10 additional applications of your favorite cosmetic that prior to having went to waste.</li>
    <li> We all hate spending money on lip gloss that we can use! I bought a few to give as gifts and my friends are loving them too!</li>
    <li> Nikki&#x27;s magic wand has helped me get the last nook &amp; cranny of my favorite lip glosses!! It has come to the rescue on those mornings when I am running late and realize I hardly have any lip gloss left.  It definitely performs magic with saving money since I get to use every single ounce of my products!! Thank you, Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand!</li>
    <li> I have always hated throwing away lip gloss and lipstick tubes when there is so much left THAT I CAN&#x27;T GET TO,  NOW I don&#x27;t have to waste all that - NIKKI&#x27;S MAGIC WAND HAS SOLVED THAT PROBLEM. LUVVVVV IT!!  Too bad I didn&#x27;t think of it first!!</li>
    <li> Love it--and I got a hand written note from Nikki herself, thanking me for my order.  It feels good supporting her dream!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter, who always used qtips to try and get the last bit of her lip gloss out of her tubes. SHE LOVED IT !! No more  throwing away almost empty bottles of makeup and lipgloss !!!</li>
    <li> I love my new magical wand! I finally get to use up all of the lip gloss in my lip gloss tubes, thanks to Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand.

    <li> I LOVE this wand!!!  I am going to save TONS of money.  I can&#x27;t believe no one has ever thought of this before.  All I can say is THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!!</li>
    <li> I hate, hate, hate wasting any amount of liquid make-up or any other make-up. Using a q-tip to get the stuff out of bottom seemed to waste some and not easy. Then, I found Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand. Amazing tool! Easy to clean and easy to use. Highly recommend. Great customer service!</li>
    <li> Love this tool for saving money.  In the past had to discard tubes of gloss that applicator was too short to reach.  Not anymore!!! Great for foundation, gloss, mascara.  You name it, it gets it. Cleans easy.</li>
    <li> I had been holding to partially empty lip gloss tubes for an unusually long amount of time...just waiting for a miracle. One of my favorite colors had been discontinued but I couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of throwing the tube away because I could seeeeee I still had more in there! Enough for a few more Friday and Saturday night escapades! Thanks to Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand I can reach every last drop left in all my tubes (not lying... I have 9...and they&#x27;re expensive!!!)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Nikki!! You should find a way to market these Wands with a cape!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister in law, she swears this is the best invention ever!!!! Pays for itself in less than 2 months of use!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my \\&quot;Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand\\&quot;!!! I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I&#x27;ve been using it to get the last bits of my Chapstick/Carmex out of the tube/jar. Many times I&#x27;ve been forced to throw away the last of the product that&#x27;s in the jar because I couldn&#x27;t reach it...either my nails get in the way or I get Carmex under them. Yuck! This tool has been a God send!</li>
    <li> No longer will I have to throw away lipgloss that I cannot reach because the wand it too short! My Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand reaches ALL of the nooks and crannies of my favorite lip gloss tubes! It used to break my heart to throw away a tube of makeup or lipgloss that still had about 1/3 of unreachable makeup left.This reusable wand is so flexible, soft and chic! It&#x27;s a staple in my cosmetic bag--both on the go &amp; at home. This wand has helped me to completely enjoy my make up down to the last drop, literally! Teens through 55 and older will love this little beauty.</li>
    <li> Helps you reach every last bit of the gloss that you spent your hard earned money on. Compact and easy to use, it&#x27;s the must have for your cosmetics bag.</li>
    <li> So tired of buying product and leaving some in the tube or bottle because I can&#x27;t get it all out...it&#x27;s like the cosmetics companies are toying with me. Well, this little wand ends all that. It works for lip gloss tubes and I have used it for foundation, too. THAT STUFF IS EXPENSIVE -- now I can get every last drop of it!!!</li>
    <li> I have a drawer full of half empty make up. Now I can get that last little bit of my favorite lip gloss!</li>
    <li> Found Nikki&#x27;s Magic Wand on Facebook. I love all things makeup, and it was suggested on SEVERAL makeup forums/blogs there.  I ordered the product IMMEDIATELY.  My wands were shipped and arrived to my home, lightening fast.  I opened it and FELL IN LOVE! I love makeup, but am also so frugal.  I want to use my product and get ALL of my monies worth.
