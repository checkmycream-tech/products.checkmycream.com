      <li>Honest review:  </li>
      <li>she was a good girl :)</li>
      <li>I would  say this doll is more for curling styles &amp; practicing sew-in, does hold braids nicely, still tryin it out though</li>
      <li>I am learning more about providing my own hair care at home.</li>
      <li>Nice head of hair to practice on love it.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s the perfect choice, for young upcoming stylist, and cosmetic students.     </li>
      <li>the hair is so soft, the height is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>It is a great product to practice hairstyles and my daughter loves it very much.</li>
      <li>Anyway she is also a better lQQking manikin in person</li>
      <li>Couple of gray hairs but who cares :)</li>
      <li>Too many layers.</li>
      <li>so she would style better.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t pull it into a ponytail to keep it from onto the section I am working on because the hair is also layered so many areas are even shorter than 10 inches</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>No tangles like most mannequins.</li>
      <li>I AM NOW ORDERING 2 MORE</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve dyed her hair, cut it, curled it, put cute bumpy curls in it,</li>
      <li>This mannequin is ok....</li>
      <li>, I evaluated this as honestly and accurately as I could.  </li>
      <li>I love my purchase.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased because all her hair is shedding out</li>
      <li>I have yet to use it, but I&#x27;s sure it will serve it purpose.</li>
      <li>Love her will buy again</li>
      <li>I love the mannequin.</li>
      <li>Just got it today, glad I found it on Amazon because I was planning to order one from &amp;#34;Lee Beauty School&amp;#34; and it would have cost me $50</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>the best HUMAN HAIR MANIKIN&#x27;S EVER!</li>
      <li>She is okay</li>
      <li>Looks better than the photo</li>
      <li>Her HAIR IS 150% REAL!!!!</li>
      <li>it was pretty good</li>
      <li>The quality was pretty good for what I needed it to do.</li>
      <li>shes beautiful have nice long hair</li>
      <li>Very good manikin for the price especially for cosmetology students</li>
      <li>but overall a good purchase !</li>
      <li>Served its purpose...but sheds easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s right for the price I guess, but I just wish that the sellers were more truthful with regards to length.</li>
      <li>the new length ends have to be papered and rolled in so that no fish hooks occur, not something I have to do on my pricier manikin I received in my student kit, but good practice as I have had clients with hair just like that</li>
      <li>The picture is accurate, when pulled out of the box my manikin looked just like that.</li>
      <li>Every time I see her she has a different hairstyle on it lol</li>
      <li>i think it might be because the manikin was so cheap   </li>
      <li>great for curly updos not regular ones great for beginners only get this doll if you wanna wrk with ethnic hair</li>
      <li>Too cheap.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to finally get her!!</li>
      <li>The hair is silky soft, it feels really good.  </li>
      <li>My first mannequin head!!</li>
      <li>She is a beginner and this item was budget friendly.</li>
      <li>I am a hair braider and as long as the hair does not fall it, it will be great.</li>
      <li>Very sturdy head,  inexpensive and for the most part light weight.&lt;br</li>
      <li>she loves it and is quickly learning how to braid.</li>
      <li>I got this as an early birthday gift for my 12 year old daughter and she was so happy to receive it</li>
      <li>Rather than being more flexible and easy to pull upward or in different directions.  </li>
      <li>the pros are the price was low and it takes and holds curls amazingly.</li>
      <li>Glad it was for my 11yr old daughter wantn to start styling hair.</li>
      <li>The rest of my review is pretty good, and truth is if the length of hair had be accurately described I would hands down have given this manikin 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>Also want to mention that this item was shipped super fast.</li>
      <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a pretty good buy so far.</li>
      <li>Any way the shipping was very fast and it was packaged well.</li>
      <li>Hair is layered not all one length, and lengths varied from approx  7-8 inches in some places to approx 12 inches, but mostly averaged approx 9 inches overall.  </li>
      <li>has is too short and too many lengths.  </li>
      <li>It was also a plus that we have the same name :-)</li>
      <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>She is pretty.  </li>
      <li>bu other then that shes amazing</li>
      <li>Love the texture, BUT she has way too much scalp &amp; not enough hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am so disappointed that the hair was advertised as 16-17 inches however, the longest strand was only 10 inches.  I can&#x27;t pull it into a ponytail to keep it from onto the section I am working on because the hair is also layered so many areas are even shorter than 10 inches, I just don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning an item even though I did not get what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping but the hair wasnt 100% Human melted when hair is colored and when hair was hot ironed it melted very dissapointed I needed this to teach Ethnic Hair to my class.</li>
    <li> this manikin is losing hair like it has cancer it constantly falling out im not sure why i havent dye or cut yet. i fail my first test in school because the hair kept falling out   i think it might be because the manikin was so cheap   ps. do not buy</li>
    <li> I  purchased this for my daugher who simply just wanted a maniquin head to do hair and paly in my hair is cut short and she can not always play in mommys hair so i recieved this and it was awesome terribly excited about giving this as her Hanukkah gift ! THe hair is not as long as it looks in pic it may be becuase the hair has been lying aginst head in package but it feels great and it looks nice!</li>
    <li> The quality of the hair was good for cutting. No tangles like most mannequins. The hair did not comb forward. Which made cutting bangs impossible.</li>
    <li> Love the texture, BUT she has way too much scalp &amp; not enough hair. Overall, it&#x27;s iindve what k expected for what I paid.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all.it is not an African American textured hair and therefore it is hard to part and style the way we style our hair</li>
    <li> I have yet to use it, but I&#x27;s sure it will serve it purpose. I am a hair braider and as long as the hair does not fall it, it will be great.</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter</li>
    <li> Very sturdy head,  inexpensive and for the most part light weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I&#x27;ve run into was her hair still being a little to silky for braids or a wig cap.</li>
    <li> Brought for my daughter to practice doing braiding on.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter. She is a beginner and this item was budget friendly. The item arrived on time and it actually a great head to work on. We are referring other to the site to place orders.</li>
    <li> it was pretty good I would suggest buy it if you don&#x27;t want African American hair and do not color it because it is stupid color ever</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my niece...she loves it and is quickly learning how to braid.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a good time , but the hair is not as ethnic as I wanted it to be but overall a good purchase !</li>
    <li> JASMINE SEAMS TO HAVE ALREADY BEEN CUT. SHE HAS A LOT OF REAL SHORT HAIR WITHIN THE LONG HAIR.WHEN  THE HAIR IS WET AND READY TO ROLL FOR A SET IS WHEN YOU DISCOVER THIS SHORT HAIR STANDING UP.I CHOSE HER BECAUSE AT THE TIME SHE WAS WITHIN MY BUDGET.</li>
    <li> excellent mannakin jasmin my daughter loves it great job on time delivery</li>
    <li> Good for braiding, curling,cutting and styling will lift it soon? hair feels like fiber but can be washed and heat styled!</li>
    <li> Just got it today, glad I found it on Amazon because I was planning to order one from &amp;#34;Lee Beauty School&amp;#34; and it would have cost me $50 so I saved $20....&amp;#34;Thanks Amazon&amp;#34;! I plan to on using this to brush up on my hair skills and someday start doing a few hairdo&#x27;s on the side for a little bit of extra $$$$. Anyway she is also a better lQQking manikin in person so I know I can work with her. Bought a stand too to give me some support. Just may order the other one with longer hair like 21&amp;#34; or 24&amp;#34;. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Misleading about Hair Length, Not even close to described length.  Hair is layered not all one length, and lengths varied from approx  7-8 inches in some places to approx 12 inches, but mostly averaged approx 9 inches overall.  Ok, that was my complaint.      The rest of my review is pretty good, and truth is if the length of hair had be accurately described I would hands down have given this manikin 5 stars.  As a poor cosmetology student I found the price to be fantastic.  Opening the box and pulling the manikin out, loved that she is attractive.  The picture is accurate, when pulled out of the box my manikin looked just like that. Hair is as long as shown in picture, just not the lengths stated in description as stated above. The hair is silky soft, it feels really good.  Combs out well wet or dry.  Parting this manikins hair and sectioning is excellent.  The hair is not really thick, some might find that as a negative, me I love it because my other manikin has thick course hair and this one allows me to style a different texture more fine and less dense.    I trimmed the border of the hair today in a blunt cut around the perimeter of the lowest portion of the neck base and began rolling it into a perm (keep in mind the hair is layered already) just wanted to even up the ends so she would style better. again my only issue here is that the hair is different lengths and so as I get the hair rolled half way up the new length ends have to be papered and rolled in so that no fish hooks occur, not something I have to do on my pricier manikin I received in my student kit, but good practice as I have had clients with hair just like that that I had to place end papers in as I rolled up to catch shorter lengths.  I don&#x27;t think this manikin would be good for up dos hair has is too short and too many lengths.  I think she is average for actual cutting on, probably get a couple cuts in on her depending on the style.  Have not used chemicals on hair or thermal irons, but is 100% human hair so don&#x27;t see that as a problem. Would I buy this manikin again even with the misleading hair length? Yes.  Over all a great backup manikin.  Hope this helps other future cosmetologists, I evaluated this as honestly and accurately as I could.  Also want to mention that this item was shipped super fast.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased because all her hair is shedding out and she&#x27;s smaller than I thought it was it looks as her hair is getting shorter every time you come her hair from shedding</li>
    <li> I am learning more about providing my own hair care at home. I needed a mannequin head for practice. Also, my girls love to play with these mannequins too! It&#x27;s helping them to learn to braid and style hair without yanking all of mine out!</li>
    <li> I love the mannequin. The only problem I have is that her hair is not as described, it&#x27;s short.  The hair is about 8 to 10 inches long, and not 16 to 17 inches long as described.  It&#x27;s right for the price I guess, but I just wish that the sellers were more truthful with regards to length.</li>
    <li> Served its purpose...but sheds easy.</li>
    <li> I bought her for state board and she has perfect hair omg her hair is super soft and she&#x27;s so pretty she give me no problems at state board she was a good girl :)</li>
    <li> not sure why they call her ethnic hair , nothing is ethnic about it, but for a teaching head she works very well her hair is easy to deal with.</li>
    <li> My kids played with it for hours.</li>
    <li> Love her will buy again</li>
    <li> Perfect, just what I needed! Can&#x27;t wait to start styling, cutting and coloring! Couple of gray hairs but who cares :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who complains that the head on her Barbies are too small to do any good styles. She absolutely loves it. Keep in mind that it is a budget mannequin so it is not premium quality. The hair in the front is a little thin, and the length is very uneven .  It is in layers but they are short and the hair in the crown barely reaches the ears. I purchased this based on other reviews that were similar to mine so I knew what to expect. I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to an aspiring cosmetologist as it does not even meet the standard for students in my opinion. But it works perfectly for what I need it for.</li>
    <li> Good quality hair. Can be washed and curled.  Too many layers. Very short in some sections. Bought it for my daughter to practice braiding and styling.</li>
    <li> The quality was pretty good for what I needed it to do. Length of hair was shorter than the description given.</li>
    <li> I got this as an early birthday gift for my 12 year old daughter and she was so happy to receive it she hugged her father and I so tight it hurt. Any way the shipping was very fast and it was packaged well. As for how well it will work for her practice to become a cosmetologists I haven&#x27;t seen yet but will try to write an update after she has used it for a while.</li>
    <li> Ms. Jasmine, was truly great to work with. Her HAIR IS 150% REAL!!!! I will however agree the hair length is a tad misleading, but she has true long hair, and with the reasonable price and fast shipping, you just can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;ve dyed her hair, cut it, curled it, put cute bumpy curls in it, and I&#x27;ve straightened it on numerous occasions. She&#x27;s the perfect choice, for young upcoming stylist, and cosmetic students.     The only downfall to this fabulous purchase was the fact her hair isn&#x27;t really thick. She can handle Big Braids, And small ones, but you must keep the hair clean, washed and  tangle free to adjust to that. This purchase however was great. I&#x27;ve bought to heads, and i&#x27;m purchasing my another now.   \\&quot;Celebrity\\&quot; makes the best HUMAN HAIR MANIKIN&#x27;S EVER!</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for a styling head for Christmas, and I chose this one. It was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The Jasmine manikin sheds a little and doesnt have close perimeter strands and she&#x27;s thin so I wouldnt recommend her for up-dos or fantasy styling. However, she is great for cuts, curls, sets, weave bases.....the basics.</li>
    <li> Looked just like the description.  It is a great product to practice hairstyles and my daughter loves it very much.</li>
    <li> using hair for braids it&#x27;s hard to try French braids because there are layers in her hair. Hair is very silky and slips quite a bit when braiding. Will add photo later.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this manikin head. She is 7 and having a doll head that does not have missing spots and she is able to flat iron the hair. Best gift ever for her.</li>
    <li> This manikin serves its purpose. Started using it immediately, My only downer is that I thought it came with the manikin holder for the price I paid for it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who wants to do hair. She loves it, I made a very good decision.</li>
    <li> did not like the hair.</li>
    <li> Great.. My daughter loves it</li>
    <li> great for curly updos not regular ones great for beginners only get this doll if you wanna wrk with ethnic hair</li>
    <li> She is okay her hair is way too soft does not have hetnic hair at all</li>
    <li> The reason I bought Jasmine is because I really do not have the hands and skills to do ANYTHING with hair. I just want to teach myself basic styles and maybe even how to french braid. It was also a plus that we have the same name :-) As soon as I got her, I put earrings in her ears to look like sort of like me. Lol. But Jasmine has RELAXED African textured hair, so it is a little difficult at first until you learn how to control it. It does shed quite a bit. And I am not lying when I say this... HER HAIR IS NOT 16-17 INCHES LONG. Like someone else said, it IS layered and may be about 12 in long. But it&#x27;s good for me, however, I would not recommend buying this for something serious like school or your salon. But for beginners, I think it is a good buy. (I posted pics).</li>
    <li> The head was horrible and hair was not good</li>
    <li> Honest review:  ★The head came within the estimated time.  ★Packaged well.  ★She is pretty.  ◆Her head is like the size of a 6-7 year old but with a young woman&#x27;s look to her face.  ◆Her hair is quite short since there are different lengths throughout her head.  ◆Her hair doesn&#x27;t fall naturally which makes parting difficult in comparison to a real head of hair. The dolls hair falls stiff straight down. Rather than being more flexible and easy to pull upward or in different directions.  ◆Hair sheds too much.   ◆Back and sides much thicker than the top. The top is soooo thin. Too much scalp. :(  In general, it&#x27;s not that great or for me, not exactly what I expected.  But could potentially do the job for my 8 year old to practice playing different hair styles.  Not realistic enough for me.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASH HER!!! Tangled up and was not able to use anymore. Waste of money</li>
    <li> She is everything I dreamed of!! I was so happy to finally get her!! you can see her featured on my instagram page @Beautyfuldesires</li>
    <li> Very good manikin for the price especially for cosmetology students my only issue dont really care for the texture of the hair</li>
    <li> Very nice came on time as stated</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. She just wishes her hair was a little bit longer.</li>
    <li> I really love Jasmine, I&#x27;m having fun practice everyday. Her hair is not too long or too short</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the texture of the hair and it&#x27;s hard to part the hair</li>
    <li> This was a smart quick buy but was disappointed that her hair was much shorter then expected. I needed a permanent wave doll and she was it.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOve it; natural hair. the hair is so soft, the height is perfect for me. I bought it to learn how to do hair, and so far I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;delivery was perfect and the mankin is beautiful</li>
    <li> She arrived the day before the estimated delivery dates. Her hair is soft and manageable, she can be curled with rollers, braids, flat ironed, even can be finger waved as well. I would recommend this manikin head and i would repurchase her again.</li>
    <li> Real hair, but definitely not ethnic.</li>
    <li> This was a bday gift from my husband and I love it. My first mannequin head!! :)  It does shed, but I&#x27;m sure all mannequin heads shed a little. The length of the hair that is in the picture is what you get. If you are looking for coarse African American hair, this is NOT it.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend buying this product. I thought it was good quality hair. When I ran my fingers through it, the hair immediately started shedding. I did not pay it no mind until I started practicing braiding. The hair is very thin and the hair sheds strands like crazy. Sent this item back the next day after it came in the mail. On the bright side Amazon refund my money immediately on my credit card. I am currently looking for another manikin!!!!</li>
    <li> This mannequin is ok.... I mean you get what you pay for. Yes the hair is thin. It looks as if its going bald. The hair is ABSOLUTELY NOT ETHIC IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM...lol...and its hard to braid due to the thinness. That was all the cons....the pros are the price was low and it takes and holds curls amazingly. The hair seems to  come already layered so I didnt have to cut it much, just the ends due to a small bit of shedding. Would I recommend  this product? Not for an adult...maybe for a little girl to play with :-(</li>
    <li> Nice head of hair to practice on love it.</li>
    <li> I brought this as a gift for my cousins daughter for Christmas when she opened it and seen all the other things that i had gotten to go with it she was to excited, thank u for helping me put a smile on her face</li>
    <li> My niece loved it ! The hair doesnt fall out and its very natural looking. Every time I see her she has a different hairstyle on it lol</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this 100% ethnic hair. It&#x27;s closer to relaxed African-American hair &amp; was much thinner than I espected. Glad it was for my 11yr old daughter wantn to start styling hair. If it were for me specifically, I would be disappointed. It&#x27;s almost to soft to even put in a ponytail. You can put rollers in it &amp; use curlers/flatirons. So if that&#x27;s all you need it for, the it would wk for you.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS I AM NOW ORDERING 2 MORE THEY SHOULD BE HERE SOON</li>
    <li> Looks better than the photo</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for my six year old granddaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> shes beautiful have nice long hair but when u say ethnic people get the impression of the manniquin having black peoples hair but she really have caucasian hair. bu other then that shes amazing</li>
    <li> Too cheap.  But you get what you pay for.  It will certainly teach you how to clip ends.</li>
    <li> On the surface it looks like an African American doll but when I received it, the mannequin was a Caucasian doll colored brown.</li>
    <li> I love my purchase. Hair doesn&#x27;t shed. 100% human hair!! Perfect for any styles! Highly recommended for cosmetology students! Love it!</li>
    <li> Not the quality I was expecting</li>
    <li> I bought these for my granddaughters for Christmas and it is great</li>
    <li> This doll&#x27;s hair is thin, fine, fluffy &amp; a little uneven which is kinda realistic (see a lot of scalp)should be a little bit fuller. I would  say this doll is more for curling styles &amp; practicing sew-in, does hold braids nicely, still tryin it out though, I&#x27;ve only had it a little over a week. Overall I think it&#x27;s a pretty good buy so far.</li>
    <li> great for state board</li>
