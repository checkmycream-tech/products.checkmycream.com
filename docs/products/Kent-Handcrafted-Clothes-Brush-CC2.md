      <li>Just right bristle stiffness and good size for travel.</li>
      <li>It is about looking nice AND keeping your clothing (particularly wool) in good shape in the long-term.</li>
      <li>The bristles have just the right stiffness to them--enabling you to effectively rid your clothes of lint and debris/dirt--even on fine materials like merino wool and cashmere.  </li>
      <li>I love to clean my caps too.  </li>
      <li>The brush is good and of high quality.</li>
      <li>Not only this brush is beautifully handcrafted, it does deliver.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Works well to brush light dirt &amp; hair off my work clothes.</li>
      <li>Very portable and does a nice job removing debris from suits.</li>
      <li>You could probably get the same effect from a cheaper brush, but if you&#x27;re looking for quality and a brand that has a history of making great brushes, this is it.</li>
      <li>but the CC2 seems to fit comfortably in my wife&#x27;s hand.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion it&#x27;s the perfect size for everyday use.  </li>
      <li>This is a beautifully made, small clothes brush which is extremely effective in removing lint, dust and hair from clothing.  </li>
      <li>Bristles are stiff without being overly so, and are perfectly matched to the task at hand.  </li>
      <li>Very powerful</li>
      <li>Cleaning the debris from the brush with a hair pick is quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>A good clothes brush is essential to a man&#x27;s wardrobe if he wears fine suits.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really wonderful little brush, well worth the money, since it will probably outlast you.</li>
      <li>It is also effective in helping garments look refreshed and new between cleanings.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth spending a few bucks to keep your clothes looking their best.</li>
      <li>I feel like a pimp when I use this brush to clean my suits.  </li>
      <li>I also received the brushes faster than I&#x27;d expected which was a welcome surprise.</li>
      <li>its good but smaller than I thought</li>
      <li>This is a product every adult should own.  </li>
      <li>If it fits the Queen&#x27;s use, then it should be good enough for us peasants, I guess.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be worth it, but once I used it, I really saw that the brush was much better.</li>
      <li>Between the mud and paw prints, I can quickly brush away the &amp;#34;outside&amp;#34; grime that accumulates each day.</li>
      <li>the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the Kent brush, as it has performed well after several months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>clothing brush is quite possibly the most overlooked gentleman&#x27;s accessory/tool--do yourself a favor and get one!</li>
      <li>Being handcrafted by Kent, famous for their brushes and use of natural boar bristles, is an added bonus!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to see how it works on his suits and pants, but I think it was worth the buy.</li>
      <li>It is pricey, but durable and worth it.  </li>
      <li>Ok, boys and girls, this is old school stuff here.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was worth the investment to maintain my wool suits, pants, and sports coats.</li>
      <li>The brush was actually smaller than I anticipated, but the brush is quite effective.</li>
      <li>use on suits, coats, sweaters, shirts and even jeans can be given a fresh appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>red lint brushes are okay, but a real clothes brush is so far superior</li>
      <li>so I can keep my clothes fresh on the road.  </li>
      <li>The brush arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Bristles are just the right stiffness.  </li>
      <li>Bristles just the right stiffness.  </li>
      <li>Though it is a compact size, it will do the job right.</li>
      <li>From my old-man perspective, a product is only remarkable if it does not work how it is supposed to or if it completely changes the way I think about its use.</li>
      <li>so I am not sure how it compares to others, but it works great.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> High quality, works well. I wish it were just a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Very nicely made -- it feels great in my hand. Works well to brush light dirt &amp; hair off my work clothes.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush, perfect size for travel. I will probably get a second slightly larger brush with a handle for use at home. This is my first clothes brush so I am not sure how it compares to others, but it works great. Hair, lint and other gunk easily brushes off, ideal for sport coats/ suits.</li>
    <li> After years of destroying my clothes from unnecessary washings, I discovered this Kent clothes brush and am amazed by the wonders it works. I&#x27;ve wasted money on sticky lint rollers in the past, and their abilities pale in comparison this this excellent tool. With this brush I can work residue out of fabrics, cutting down on trips to the cleaners, and quickly remove lint and dust before heading to the office.</li>
    <li> Does a great job removing lint from clothes, and linens.  The CC2 is much better than the sticky paper rollers we have been using for years.  We have not used this brush for pet hair.  After several months of use, we are totally satisfied.  As others have said, the brush is smaller than you might expect, 1 1/4&amp;#34; x 5 1/2&amp;#34; with 5/8&amp;#34; long bristles.  The wood handle is about a 1/4&amp;#34; larger in both directions.  I could use a larger brush but the CC2 seems to fit comfortably in my wife&#x27;s hand.  The smaller size gives her better control.  The construction and finish is excellent.  A nice feature is that the brush holds the lint and fibers that it removes.  Cleaning the debris from the brush with a hair pick is quick and easy.  If you are not sure about spending this kind of money on a lint brush, try using a shoe brush first.  My horsehair shoe brush is a close match and removed the lint well, but the bristles on the CC2 are shorter, slightly stiffer and seem to lift the lint better.  If you run the comparison, remember the CC2 is flat.  Many shoe brushes are curved.  3/31/17 update.  Still using this brush.  Works very well on cat hair.</li>
    <li> Works great to take off hair from clothing. A little smaller than expected in regard to its size, but still works great.</li>
    <li> From my old-man perspective, a product is only remarkable if it does not work how it is supposed to or if it completely changes the way I think about its use. This does neither. It is a quality made clothing brush that helps to get rid of any food crumbs, dust, or other bits of dirt that--in the long term--will reduce the life of quality clothing. For use on suits, jackets, pants, and shirts, I much prefer this to the sticky lint roller things that people use to get dog hairs off their black clothing. It is not sticky and it is not disposable. It is about looking nice AND keeping your clothing (particularly wool) in good shape in the long-term. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this when I travel for my job. I&#x27;m often visiting farms and ranches with dogs. Between the mud and paw prints, I can quickly brush away the &amp;#34;outside&amp;#34; grime that accumulates each day.</li>
    <li> Works well to remove lint from a wool suit.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived quickly and was exactly as described. It is easy to maneuver and does a beautiful job on my wool coat.</li>
    <li> This is a beautifully made, small clothes brush which is extremely effective in removing lint, dust and hair from clothing.  It is also effective in helping garments look refreshed and new between cleanings.  On a heavyweight fleece jacket that was looking well past its prime, a good brushing not only cleaned up the jacket, but also restored the nap, rescuing it from a matted-down, unattractive appearance to the velvety feel of its youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really wonderful little brush, well worth the money, since it will probably outlast you.</li>
    <li> Compact size, but fits in the hand well.  Small enough to travel, but large enough to use at home on a regular basis. Bristles just the right stiffness.  Seems well made.  Pricey, but should last a long time.  I avoid dry cleaning suits and sports jackets (which ruins them) and prefer to brush them to keep them new and fresh looking whenever possible.  This brush is just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This brush will surprise you by making all your sweaters look new as well as keep your clothes fresh, breathing and will even cause your winter clothing to keep you warmer, as dust/dirt inhibits the ability of wool to breathe and keep you warm.&lt;br /&gt;For use on suits, coats, sweaters, shirts and even jeans can be given a fresh appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to see how well this brush worked on family&#x27;s clothes.</li>
    <li> The brush is nicely made and works exactly as you would hope - the stiff bristles remove lint and restore the fabric&#x27;s nap. My only complaint is the cheap plastic packaging that does not reflect the quality of the brush. If I had wanted to give this as a present I would have been very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ok, boys and girls, this is old school stuff here.  My dad always had a clothes brush like these to freshen up his suits.  They work.  Do not get one with synthetic bristles.  The real deal is like this British item -- natural bristles.  It is unmatched for getting off minor dust smudges (e.g. when you bump against a dirty car in a parking lot) and the like off of wool suits.  Before there was widespread dry cleaning this is how you got your wool clothes looking squared away.  This is a good one.  I expect it will last around twenty years or more.</li>
    <li> The brush is good and of high quality. There is nothing on the picture to compare the brush&#x27;s size against; when it arrives it appears to be less than 6\\&quot; long.</li>
    <li> Not only this brush is beautifully handcrafted, it does deliver.&lt;br /&gt;It easily removed dust, fibers and pet hairs from my black winter coat and from my suits. It also removed pills from fine gauge merino wool sweaters.&lt;br /&gt;My parents used to have kent brushes, i am so glad i was able to obtain one without a trip to UK.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not certain of how I got to be fifty years old and never knew that a product like this existed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sticky roller brushes? TRASH! They pick stuff up but they leave a sticky residue that attracts more crap- PASS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red lint brushes are okay, but a real clothes brush is so far superior it&#x27;s almost ridiculous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in recent memory!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for keeping your coats and clothes dirt and lint free.  The size fits my hand perfectly.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have this for travel and in my briefcase. This brush helped me get makeup off of my suit shoulder after a funeral (hugging people), and allowed me to use my suit for another event on the trip.</li>
    <li> Beautiful quality.  You get what you pay for with these.</li>
    <li> This is a good quality brush. It&#x27;s pretty small, and  I thought it was a little bit pricey. I thought it was worth the investment to maintain my wool suits, pants, and sports coats.</li>
    <li> Mainly for woolen items and nothing else.  It doesn&#x27;t really do that great of a job removing lint.  I can imagine that it might do quite well to curry a horse.</li>
    <li> In general, Kent seems to make some of the best clothes brushes, which will keep your suits in good shape. This, their least expensive model, is a good value, especially for travel. The only downside is the lack of a handle, which means you need to grip the sides firmly, but this is also what makes it a good travel size. It also works fine at home; the actual brush head is not that much smaller than the models with handles.</li>
    <li> Very small but nicely made</li>
    <li> Though it is a compact size, it will do the job right. If it fits the Queen&#x27;s use, then it should be good enough for us peasants, I guess.</li>
    <li> This fine quality, traditional high end British made clothes brush will easily help keep your clothing looking clean and smart.</li>
    <li> I visited 7 big stores and i could not find a simple cloth brush mainly only those stickers rolls that are in the market today another proof that people doen´t know how to dresss these days.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush. Good size: perfect for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my landlord, she said that it&#x27;s so so</li>
    <li> Great, high-quality clothes-saving brush. Perfect size for travel or at-home. Use it all the time. Definitely saves on trips to dry-cleaners.</li>
    <li> Great brush. I use it daily. Good size and fit. Will take out small bits of dirt, etc., and also brings out the finish in my clothes. A must have for a man&#x27;s wardrobe.</li>
    <li> This is small but does the job</li>
    <li> This is the best lint brush available.  It is pricey, but durable and worth it.  It won&#x27;t ruin your wool coats, like the cheaper lint brushes do.</li>
    <li> For the price point, this is a solid garment brush that I have added to my standard travel kit so I can keep my clothes fresh on the road.  I would prefer if the ends of the bristles were slightly softer, but this gets the job done.</li>
    <li> The difference in color after brushing my black clothes is amazing</li>
    <li> I feel like a pimp when I use this brush to clean my suits.  I does a very good job at getting lint and dandruff off of my clothing.  I have used disposable sticky lint rollers in the past and prefer this.  Now all I need is a Bentley and a butler.</li>
    <li> You can really lower your dry cleaning bills on your wool suits and coats by giving them a brush.  Those cleaning chemicals can give a weird sheen, too, and this brush can even take a little of that shine off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The British wool fabric should be brushed by a British made clothing brush.  Bristles are just the right stiffness.  You don&#x27;t want to chance ruining your clothes with a cheap too stiff brush.  I don&#x27;t consider the price an indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is so gorgeous that it is a pleasure and prideful moment to use it.</li>
    <li> This brush is the business for sure. Its perfect for quick attention to my suits before going out and is really well made. It also does not take up much room on my side table. I could not be happier with its quality and results.</li>
    <li> I seriously cannot give this item enough praise.  I cannot even imagine using a lint roller ever again--they are so inferior to a well-made clothing brush like this! Also, this brush is also much faster than using a lint roller because lint rollers are essentially just tape, and once all the surface area of one sheet is filled, you have to peel it off and use another sheet.  With the brush, you just brush until your article of clothing is free of lint!  The bristles have just the right stiffness to them--enabling you to effectively rid your clothes of lint and debris/dirt--even on fine materials like merino wool and cashmere.  This will increase the life of your clothes!  This will help reduce your carbon footprint also, as it is infinitely reusable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem rather expensive compared to lint rollers, but it is made out of Cherry wood, and I truly appreciate how high-quality this item is.  The fact that it is handcrafted also appeals to me very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A clothing brush is quite possibly the most overlooked gentleman&#x27;s accessory/tool--do yourself a favor and get one!</li>
    <li> Lint rollers are a guaranteed way to wear out your nice clothes, especially delicate items like a suit jacket. Kent&#x27;s brushes have been around for a very long time and are regarded as THE brush to use. The bristles are very effective at sweeping up errant hairs, removing dust, and smoothing out small wrinkles. Don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> This, like all Kent products, is a great... I would recommend it for use at home or travel.  Fits nicely in a travel bag.</li>
    <li> One of the best if not the best men&#x27;s clothing brushes on the market to clean your garments and keep them lent free, brings out the fabric on your suit and sportcoats and slacks. All other clothing items you might have in your closet.</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be worth it, but once I used it, I really saw that the brush was much better.</li>
    <li> Well made simple clothes brush. Very portable and does a nice job removing debris from suits.</li>
    <li> The perfect size for a gentleman&#x27;s brush! Not too small, and not too large for travel. Being handcrafted by Kent, famous for their brushes and use of natural boar bristles, is an added bonus! For those unfamiliar with Kent, the company was founded in 1777 and their items are handcrafted in Apsley, Hertfordshire, UK. The brush is crafted from real cherry wood and natural boar bristle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kent considers this to be \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; but I wouldn&#x27;t want a larger one. In my opinion it&#x27;s the perfect size for everyday use.  The handle is 6 inches long by 1 1/2 inches wide.</li>
    <li> After making an investment in some high-quality suits, I received a recommendation to purchase a suit brush to maintain the fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the Kent brush, as it has performed well after several months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique is it can slip in your hands from time to time, and a few of the shorter bristles can stab your finger if you don&#x27;t grip the brush carefully.</li>
    <li> and it brushes&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey for what it is but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I had read recently that good suits should be brushed not dry cleaned.</li>
    <li> The brush performs exactly as advertised, and the purchase went through smoothly and professionally. I also received the brushes faster than I&#x27;d expected which was a welcome surprise. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. I purchased this with a Kent CP6, so if you see a near-identical review there, that would be the reason.</li>
    <li> its good but smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> This brush is a good deal at the price. The bristles are firm enough to remove particles from wool but gentle enough to use on silk (if you brush gently as well). It keeps my suits looking good and away from the cleaner&#x27;s (the killer of suits)&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I find myself dropping the brush a lot. They could design it a bit better to provide a better grip shape. But then again, I could just be clumsier than one can reasonably be expected to accommodate.</li>
    <li> Extraordinary quality and perfect for the job.</li>
    <li> After watching Downton Abbey, I wanted to feel like a gentleman.  I&#x27;ve been using it since and it just feels good to brush my clothing like the old-times.  I love to clean my caps too.  It works great.  Long live the Queen!</li>
    <li> This does exactly what you want it too.  Bristles are stiff without being overly so, and are perfectly matched to the task at hand.  Some reviewers believe the brush to be a bit small, but its dimensions are listed right here on the site, so why are they surprised by its size?  In any event, I personally find that it&#x27;s just right and works well for portability when traveling.</li>
    <li> Works great on delicates</li>
    <li> look up the name of this company its the first to have the royal seal &#x3D;) and the history of how the brush co. got its royal standing is short and sweet. The brush itself is great!!! my suits,... jackets and topcoats look much better after a good brushing.</li>
    <li> Works well and is an often overlooked aspect of suit care. Just right bristle stiffness and good size for travel.</li>
    <li> This clothes brush is exactly what I wanted. It is just like the one I had in England.&lt;br /&gt;I searched all over town and could not find one, but I found this one on Amazon in about two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.</li>
    <li> Great quality, price.</li>
    <li> The bristles fell out the first time I used this brush. Returning it to Amazon now. Not happy, expected MUCH more from this brand. It also did not do much for the fleece jacket that I purchased it for. Not happy with it all around.</li>
    <li> The brush was actually smaller than I anticipated, but the brush is quite effective.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome brush... and its made in England, not China.  It actually does an amazing job on dog hair and is much easier on your clothes than those sticky rolls.  The best part is that this one lasts forever.  It&#x27;s a great size for both home and travel.  This is a product every adult should own.  Try it and you will understand what I mean.</li>
    <li> gets rid of the dog hair lickety split.  Very powerful and if it is possible to call a clothes brush elegant... this is.</li>
    <li> great clothing brush- removes lint AND dog hair</li>
    <li> Works very well and just the right size</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and found myself using it for my coat. It left my coat looking clean and fresh. I actually even used it on my black leggings to remove cat hair, and it worked quite well. I&#x27;ll have to see how it works on his suits and pants, but I think it was worth the buy.</li>
    <li> A good clothes brush is essential to a man&#x27;s wardrobe if he wears fine suits. Brusing away the daily dust, bits of hair, and other small debris that usually goes unnoticed will help extend the life of your clothes. If you spend good money on the clothes, the inexpensive brush is great insurance to keep them looking fresh and crisp after each wearing. Only takes a few seconds to brush the jacket and trousers down. Do your fine clothes a favor, give &#x27;em a brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush because of its design,built,and durability.Most of all it&#x27;s made to last. I rate this five stars. I highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush because I was dismayed at how shabby my relatively new wool/cashmere winter coat was looking. After looking around for solutions, I stumbled across this brush, and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;m happy to say that my coat looks even better than when I first bought it, I&#x27;m amazed at what a difference it makes! It&#x27;s definitely worth spending a few bucks to keep your clothes looking their best.</li>
    <li> You could probably get the same effect from a cheaper brush, but if you&#x27;re looking for quality and a brand that has a history of making great brushes, this is it. I plan to take care of this thing well enough that it&#x27;ll last me a lifetime.</li>
