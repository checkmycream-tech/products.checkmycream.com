<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The first use was okay , Ima going to give it a second try and I&#x27;m sure it will get better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer with this line. It works very well for my two girls. Didn&#x27;t think I needed the spray, but am glad it came with the pack. It makes it easier to try to style their hair the next day and makes it soft. I also use this line for my curly hair and have been very happy.</li>
    <li> Wow what a difference this makes. Every one notices how much better my hair looks. Soft and doesn&#x27;t feel like product is in it. Love it. I ordered more!</li>
    <li> Use these on my 3 year old&#x27;s curly, mixed-chick hair and it does a great job of minimizing frizz and tangles.</li>
    <li> the mixed chicks was not right for my granddaughter hair but was able to give it to some one who loves it</li>
    <li> I have a bi-racial child, this did absolutely nothing for her hair! A waste of money!</li>
    <li> This is a great set! I haven&#x27;t found anything better for my daughter curly hair. The leave in conditioner works great and isn&#x27;t greasy like some. I do wish the price wasn&#x27;t so high, but I guess you have to pay a little extra sometimes for a good quality product.</li>
    <li> -For my biracial daughter the leave in and the shampoo is great. The detangler and conditioner are not so great. The detangler smells and the conditioner, I have to use a lot for my 18 month olds hair. When I buy again, I will only buy the shampoo and the leave in. Each mixed child&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells so good ! Works great for my kids hair (African am./Caucasian) which is tighter curls in the back and soft wavy on top. Her dad calls her Michael Jackson while the leave in conditioner is drying. Her curls are so smooth, shiny, and defined. Definitely found my go to brand.</li>
    <li> My baby is bi-racial and has thick curly tight coils.  It was torture trying to get these out until I found Mixed Chicks for kids!  The shampoo is good and the conditioner is AMAZING!!  I used the &amp;#34;tangle tamer&amp;#34; comb (HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMB) and her tangled hair would brush through so easily.  Bathtime is fun again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t afford the quad pack, I STRONGLY recommend getting the conditioner and the detangler.  The leave-in conditioner is REALLY good too...it holds the coils/curls in place and I use it after every bath while her hair is wet and after I use the tangle tamer comb and then do a final comb-through with a wide-toothed comb just to re-section the curls naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this mixed chicks pack.  I have tried EVERYTHING from johnsons for thick hair to California Baby organic products.  Mixed Chicks is the way to go!!!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped, found it made my daughter&#x27;s hair dry. Smells good and does a good job on the tangles, but made her hair feel like straw. We will go back to our previous</li>
    <li> I love the conditioner not a fan of the smell of the detangler. And wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the shampoo but we are using it.</li>
    <li> The leave in conditioner was great but I hated the shampoo and conditioner. Didn&#x27;t really think they made a difference in my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> The reason I chose this rating is it worked really well in my little girls hair. I would recommend this product to anyone that has not only a mixed child but anyone who has very curly hair and needs to tame those curls.</li>
    <li> The spray conditioner is so strange when you spray it my daughter and I start coughing it is too lightweight or something? I added a little water that helped a little. I Love the other three items now I just order them individually and will forever.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well in my 1 year old&#x27;s hair. She has curly/ wavy hair. Traditional curly hair stuff worked only for a few hours and then it was right back to a (stiff)puffy mess. Black hair care products are too greasy for her hair. This stuff tames and moisturizes curly hair without being too much. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and I can already see the difference in her hair. I have also started to add a tiny bit of pure jojoba oil and it helps too.</li>
    <li> It works ok, we have used the regular mixed chick&#x27;s before on my daughters hair, and thought we would give the kids version a try.  It&#x27;s just not the same. The shipment arrived on time and the product was in excellent condition,  just wasn&#x27;t as happy with the product as I am with the adult version.</li>
    <li> I have two mixed little girls (Asian and African American) and this product works miracles... Their hair is naturally curly so to do anything else was hard work until I found this product!!! Definitely recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my two year old because it is So hard to find tear free products for curly hair. Now I will buy nothing else it is amazing.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but really made a difference for my daughter&#x27;s hair. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Love this product line.  It has done wonders for my granddaughters hair.  I would recommend this product line to anyone.</li>
    <li> My baby is black,  but mixed chicks does wonders to her hair.  I thought the price was expensive, but now that I have it.  It&#x27;s worth the price and lasts long.  The tangle tamer is great and the leave in conditioner keeps her curls looking great.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ive use on my mixed babies hair! Ill neverbuse anything else! The leave in conditioner keeps their curls in place and keeps them from frizzing. The shampoo smells so good!</li>
    <li> Love the mixed chicks products! All of the reviews I read before buying were absolutely true! These products are perfect for managing the hair of mixed kids!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece who has really really curly hair and everytime we tried anything it would either frizz, break or just grow into a huge afro. We used this product and we felt the difference of texture in her hair almost immediately, and she was even to wear her hair down without any problems! I would definitely recommend this to anyone with curly, unruly hair! (I originally read about this product in a Parent magazine, you can check out the adult version as well)</li>
    <li> Product came fast! In good condition. And works perfect on my 3 mixed girls hair! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product. Shampoo was too harsh, Conditioner was watery and leave in and detangler were sticky. After 3 uses I gave it away- was not comfortable with these products on my 16 month old. Highly recommend ring around the curlies products.</li>
    <li> My son lovers it he loves to wash his hair now and the shampoo isn&#x27;t to harsh for him !</li>
    <li> I used this product on my daughter and by the second usage I saw the results. I would recommend this product to those of mixed race.</li>
    <li> Love these products for my daughter. Only wish they came in larger sizes. Or at least that the detangler was offered in a larger size. Love the way they smell!</li>
    <li> I was looking to try something new on my daughters.  I had been using the same products for a couple of years and wanted to switch it up.  They have pretty tight curls and the oldest (6yrs) has hair past the middle of her back when wet(she is the one this review is based on).  I LOVE the shampoo &amp; conditioner!!  The citrus scent of the shampoo is so light and refreshing!  I could see &amp; feel a difference immediately with just the shampoo.  Her hair began to feel softer and it even was becoming easier to detangle with only just the shampoo. After shampooing, I conditioned and left it in for approximately 3 minutes and detangled completely with the conditioner on. Once the conditioner was rinsed out we towel dried and then spritzed with the detangler and I added a small amount of the leave in concitioner before pulling her hair back into a braided pony.  I am very happy with this purchase and will recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> I love this product.I use it on my 4 month old daughter and she is&#x27;nt mixed, at least not in our immediate bloodline and this product still works great for her. She has 3c hair and the conditioner works wonders at softening and detangling. As for the tangle tamer and the leave-in conditioner, I felt that it left her hair feeling a bit \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and it smelled like elmers glue to me. Probably will try the tangle tamer and leave inagain once she gets older, but for now I want her to have baby soft curls and the shampoo and conditioner works great for this.</li>
    <li> Works great in my 8 month old daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> I heard about Mixed Chicks products for a while before finally caving in and buying the Quad pack for my daughter (just after she turned 2). I really didn&#x27;t think it would make that big a difference, but boy was I wrong. A little goes a long way with the shampoo and conditioner. And it smells great, too. But it&#x27;s the Tangle Tamer Spray that I absolutely fell head over heels in love with. I go through more of the spray than the other stuff, but that&#x27;s because I use it on her hair nearly every day (whereas I only wash her hair once or twice a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny, IMO.</li>
    <li> This product is great!! My daughter&#x27;s hair is naturally curly and this product brings out those curls. People are always telling me how beatiful my daughter hair is in public. The shampoo does not smell too great but, for what this product does to my child&#x27;s hair I can overlook that. This product allows my daughter&#x27;s hair to be natural with no frizz at all even in the heat!!! This product is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> my daughter has beautiful curls; but thin. this product line was recommended to me by a friend, and i love it. our routine is shampoo/rinse, conditioner (and brush out with wet brush)/rinse, then leave-in conditioner. tried the tangle tamer, but it doesn&#x27;t really work on my daughter&#x27;s hair; plus it has a fragrance, which i really do not car for (i&#x27;d prefer everything to be fragrance free - esp for kids&#x27; hair!). would recommend.</li>
    <li> I heard of this product from a co-worker &amp; read all the reviews online &amp; it sounded like an awesome product for my lil girl who is 3. She is a mixed child &amp; has the those beautiful but unruley ringlets that pretty much make an afro if you don&#x27;t fix it. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of product on her hair over the counter. The product for african american hair is just too greasy for her hair &amp; the regular stuff I use on mine isn&#x27;t qutie enough. I had found that just regular kids detangler &amp; leave in conditioner works the best. So I thought this stuff sounded great. I do really like it with only 1 exception. I do not like the detangler in the pack. It smells just like the Just for Me product line conditioning detangler you get @ walmart. I don&#x27;t like the smell &amp; it leaves the hair feeling like it has way too much product in it. So I&#x27;ve been using the Johnsons kids detangler along w the Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner. The Mixed Chicks shampoo &amp; conditioner does work GREAT! Over all its a great product just next time I buy I will buy individually so I don&#x27;t get the detangler spray. Hope this helps all you moms out there!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter after using the regular mixed chicks conditioner thinking this would be as good. Definitely not. The conditioner does not work great at all. The kids detangler is very sticky, almost like hairspray. Would not buy again</li>
    <li> I love the mixed chicks products as they accentuate your naturally curly mixed hair and make it do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I recommend watching the tutorial online on how to apply the leave in conditioner and how to scrunch and take care of your delicate curls for maximum positive results.  RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> I like that these products are all natural but they don&#x27;t seem to do anything special for my daughter&#x27;s curly locks. A friend swears by it so I ordered the set but it just doesn&#x27;t do much to tame the mane and the shampoo is difficult to rinse.</li>
    <li> My toddler daughter has unruly, ringlet curls that friz and get knotted without product in them. We have been using this pack for 3 months now and love it! While she usually needs a little pick-me-up with the spray after a nap, her curls last all day. My favorite part is that no one realizes we use product, it keeps her natural look and just makes it event better.</li>
    <li> Work great and smells great! Makes our lives so my easier! I will be buying this product for years to come</li>
    <li> It leaves hair smelling nice and works ok...But WAY too pricey!! The pumps on the bottles are too small and hard to deal with.</li>
    <li> Second set I am buying. This one is for my dtr&#x27;s home. First one I bought was for mine (gramma&#x27;s), lol  I love the products although the &amp;#34;tangle tamer&amp;#34; teneds to leave the hair stiff and sticky. Love the shampoo and conditioner though!!!</li>
    <li> I have a tried a bunch of different hair products for my daughters hair. I usually only use natural products but wanted to try this due to the great reviews. It did not work for my daughters hair at all! She is mixed (white/black) and has super tight curly hair. The texture is not rough nor soft but her hair just gets frizzy at times. I was hoping to find something to help with the frizz and help get her curls to hang down. This is not it!! It dried her hair out so bad that it literally made me cry. I don&#x27;t like the feel of this while putting it in my daughters hair either. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so I&#x27;m not going to say that I don&#x27;t recommend this but it just didn&#x27;t work for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Love it! Something that actual keeps her curls from frizzing! So happy a friend of mine recommended it! Great products!</li>
    <li> My daughter has tight spiral curls that are beautiful but a pain to comb through, dry or wet. She is 14 months so it&#x27;s hard enough to get her to sit still to get her hair combed and seeing her cry when I comb her hair makes me not want to comb it. I decided to try Mixed Chicks kids because I liked the ingredients and I had nothing to loose. Not only is my daughter&#x27;s hair so much softer, she actually sits to let me comb it (and she loves the smell of the detangler). Mixed Chicks works and my daughter&#x27;s not mixed.</li>
    <li> The yellow spray bottle doesn&#x27;t really spray so it is difficult to apply.  Other than that its okay.  The shampoo and conditioner work good.</li>
    <li> These products are perfect for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has curly hair and the products are perfect!  The shampoo does not dry out her hair and the conditioner and leave in conditioner are not heavy and reduce tangling.  Great products!</li>
    <li> Bought for granddaughter. Not the same as the one I purchased at target.  Will keep using it.  Detangle spray doesn&#x27;t work as products says it does.</li>
    <li> I have tried different products and spent a lot of money  for my daughter on her hair and none of them worked.  This products actually are perfect for her type of hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter little Journeybebe, she has the tightest curls I&#x27;ve ever seen on a bi-racial child!...Just a bit of leave in conditioner every day and BAM...serious control and softer, silkier curls for her! Love LOVE LOVE this line of haircare! Thank you! OH! And it lasts a good six to 10 months, depending on how you use it. It really only takes a BIT to do the job! :)</li>
    <li> My family is very happy with these products and I only wished that I had found it earlier.  I have two mixed boys with two different textures, one is fine and curly and the other is coarse and curly.  I no longer go through so much hair products, the excessive greasiness is now gone.  It is even easier for my boys to do their own hair.  Life doing hair is so much easier.</li>
    <li> This just didn&#x27;t have the rave results for my son that other people seem to have.  He is of mixed ethnicity (I&#x27;m white and my husband is black/white/native american) and his hair still gets frizzy and wild even when using this.  Other products I have found accentuate his ringlets, but this did not.  The smells are very faint, and actually the leave in conditioner smells a little musty and not pleasant.</li>
    <li> My daughter is African-American, Native American, and Irish. Her hair is extremely curly and tangles easily. It also requires HEAVY moisturizers. This product is just okay, in my opinion. The scent isn&#x27;t too great, but it definitely perked up my daughter&#x27;s curls... temporarily. The rinse-out conditioner moisturized her hair (which I loved) and the leave-in conditioner defined her curls and gave them shine. Unfortunately, the shine doesn&#x27;t last very long. Within a couple of hours, her curls were still curly, but they looked dry and dull again. Also, the leave-in conditioner leaves the hair feeling a bit crunchy rather than soft and bouncy. The tangle tamer does detangle the hair, but I didn&#x27;t like the scent of the product or the fact that it made my daughter&#x27;s hair feel oily/greasy. If I purchase any Mixed Chicks Kids products again, it will probably only be the rinse-out conditioner.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that mixed chics is a little vague on exactly how to use this pack of products.  I have a mixed grandson with a hot mess full head of springy ringlets.  It was trial an error but when used properly together, personally I think this stuff made a HUGE difference in his hair.  There is a spot here and there on the back of his head that it seems like nothing will work but overall it made his curls look styled, clean and on point as they say.If anything, much better than how it looked before.  I think my daughter still wants to try some other products for mixed hair as the mixed chics seems really pricey compared to some other products I&#x27;ve looked into.  Every childs hair is so vastly different and texture varies so greatly, its hard to say yes, buy this product.  Its trial and error so good luck!</li>
    <li> This item is ok. It hasn&#x27;t worked wonders in my daughters hair who is biracial. Great price though. Each goes for 12 bucks individual. Would purchase again bc it washes her hair fine and detangles great however the leave in conditioner works for a short while before my daughters hair is frizzy again.</li>
    <li> This product was for a friend&#x27;s granddaughter that is mixed race and they say it works great. Prior the mom was using coconut oil (looks like Crisco shortening??) to control her curls and keep her hair soft. That worked well but Mixed Chicks works MUCH better and last MUCH longer.</li>
    <li> It works well on my 2yr old hair</li>
    <li> Great product for the mixed kids. Smells good, gets tangles out easily. My kids hair looks and smells very nice. Kinda like Pink Oil Moisturizer for Blacks and Sebastian for Whites, all mixed in one.</li>
    <li> Dont like the smell too much</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! My daughter is interracial &amp; I have spent a ton of money on products &amp; im so happy I finally found what works!!!! Will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I actually really like this stuff. I tried a sample and it worked beautifully in my daughter&#x27;s hair. She is mixed with African-American and Caucasian. Her hair is soft and fine with a little kink and lots of beautiful curls. This product softens and brings out the curls. It looked gorgeous. I would recommend to  people with hair like my daughter&#x27;s. Not sure of other hair types</li>
    <li> My 11 month old has curly hair but we had a hard time finding an appropriate product for a baby that would be gentle enough to use and yet still hold her curls.  We hit the jackpot here!  This was a great recommendation!</li>
    <li> Great shipping, good seller. I just love mixed chicks hair products. I use it on myself and my children. Not only does it soften your hair, the smell is indescribable lol. I love love love the smell!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter who is mixed. I could never find a product that worked with her hair, and this works great. At first she was nervous about getting it in her eyes. But we have not had an issue with it. I will continue to buy this product for her.</li>
    <li> Perfect started using products when my baby was about 7months. I recommend this to anyone it&#x27;s not so harsh for your baby&#x27;s hair. If your child have curly thick hair works perfectly.</li>
    <li> got exactly what i wanted, saved me the time of going to the store to see if they had all four in stock.</li>
    <li> I loved the detangler, it was the best I&#x27;ve bought so far the rest I liked but feel for the money it should of been better.</li>
    <li> Love the conditioner but all the others are the same as cheaper products! The detangler is defiantly not what I hoped only use it to wet up hair but does not detangle.y girls are only one so maybe to soon for me to rate as I am new with curly hair :)</li>
    <li> This worked perfect for my biracial child hair!!! Will continue to use and reorder!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on comments. My daughter is mixed and has thick curly hair African and Mexican, This didn&#x27;t do the trick. After a month I couldn&#x27;t see the difference. I also used mixed chicks in combination with other products and it worked better. You win some you lose some. It hair product you purchase you are taking a gamble whether it it will work.</li>
    <li> I have an East Indian &amp; black daughter with curly hair. I tried everything... Even the most expensive sprays. This made my daughters hair soft and the curls looked tamed. Before  the other products would dry out her hair even the ones with coconut oil and Shea butter. Love it and recommending ti to everyone</li>
    <li> This makes my caucasian daughter&#x27;s hair pull up into the most perfect tight ringlets.  Highly recommend the leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very wavy thick hair ...her hair is not coarse though.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the shampoo &amp; the conditioner and the leave in - not a fan of the de-tangle spray....I thought it was very sticky...and I did not like the smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;Tried to dilute it with water ...but still was sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Love the rest - would not buy the detangler though again.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I liked this set...you get to try out and see what works for you and what doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This product is ok - my daughter is mixed- her hair is not even that coarse (she is half black &amp; Indian) and her hair does much better when I use Moroccan oil based conditioner and Baby Johnson leave in detangler spray.  I have been using this on her since she was abt 4 months old and her hair is so easy to manage.  I found the smell too strong for a baby.  Every time I used it I could see her hair looking heavy with product.  I wont be buying this again.  A little babies hair should not need 4 products to get it to be manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a kid, but the kids product works better in my hair, not sure why but the adult one leaves my hair extra dry and bushy.. I&#x27;m African American and i needed something to define the curls and it works. If anyone having problems with Dry hair after washing, add a handful of oil (Any kind like olive oil, cooking oil (Not crisco or pam) while washing your hair and when you put the leave in conditioner in I did a palm full (olive oil) and rubbed it in my hair along with the Leave in conditioner.. my hair turned out soft and curled the way I like...</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say that this product can be used on boys hair too. My son is mixed (I am white and my husband is black) and he has a little fro thing going on. Lol. His hair was always pretty dry and he has had scaley flakes since he was 3mos old. Up until now I was just putting pink baby lotion on his scalp and through his hair after I washed it once a week with baby aveeno conditoning shampoo, and it did an ok job for a while but it never cured the problem. The flakes were never visible throughout his hair, they just stayed on the scalp. When he turned 16mos I was fed up. So I tried the Mixed Chicks Kids Quad pack and all I have to say is that I wished I hadn&#x27;t waited so long! It was a miracle worker. I use the shampoo once a week. I use the conditioner several times throughout the week. I use the leave-in after each shampoo. The detangler dosnt really work on his hair as far as tangling goes. Lol. I use it more as a refresher in the morning. It smells great too. All in all the products are great. He hasn&#x27;t had one flake in his hair since we started using them 3wks ago. His little fro is more moist now and it didn&#x27;t make his hair look like a girl&#x27;s. His father won&#x27;t let me cut it off just yet (lol) so luckily we have products that are just right for his blended type of hair now.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my 2 year old and it works great...I have also noticed her hair is growing. I will purchase it again!!!</li>
    <li> My review on the MixedChicks Kids Line: So far, I love it. Works great on My daughter&#x27;s hair texture. If your child has fine, curly hair, it&#x27;s definitely a must buy. The leave-in conditioner keeps the hair moist while styling complete head, no need to reapply more. I saw the curls become defined instantly. A+</li>
    <li> Mix Chicks is great for my grandchildrens hair. It keeps tangles away and does not burn their eyes. Ships very fasyt and very well packaged. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> My twin boys are biracial and have nice hair but it was feeling  dry til I started using Mixed chicks! Now it feels so soft and like it should be!! I LOVE mixed chicks it&#x27;s all they use now!!! The whole system works wonders.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING for my little guy. His hair is crazy, curly and impossible, but this stuff works. He no longer cries or makes a fuss when it&#x27;s time to comb his hair. In fact I love it so much, that I sometimes use it for myself.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old biracial girl&#x27;s hair is so soft and super manageable after using this amazing product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had tired everything for my sons hair because he has the perfect mixture of his dad and mine hair. I could never get it to do anything until now. I can pick it out and it hasnt dried out his scalp at all. I love this stuff so now my son can grow out his hair into a fro that he has been wanting instead of cutting it short all the time!</li>
    <li> This worked ok but my daughters hair is very very dry. Once her hair dried it was back to frizzy. But I was very pleased with the detangler.  It detangled her hair very well</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My daughter is mix of a little bit of everything and I&#x27;m half Filipino. Her hair is like mine, only, when she sweats it knots up easily in the back, especially while she&#x27;s sleeping. Using this kit it makes it easier to get her hair back in order. We&#x27;ve used up most of the kit and are about ready to order another!</li>
    <li> Everything in this pack smells great and seems to work good, but I expected better. My daughters hair still becomes frizzy after using all 4 products as directed. Also her neck broke out in a rash after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandkids and my nieces daughter everyone loves it about time there was something for the mixed families..&lt;br /&gt;hair is so manageable and the tangles fall out just a great product</li>
    <li> It is the first product that has worked on our four year olds hair! Best ever!</li>
    <li> Good timing, great price!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for my 2year old son who is mixed with curly hair. Keeps his curls looking cute and fresh without the frizz!</li>
    <li> Top quality products. I love what they do for my daughter&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s grown tremendously since I&#x27;ve been using mixed chicks.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo I have been looking for the right shampoo for my Daughter&#x27;s and little sister&#x27;s hair type for a while now and I think I found it, it leaves her hair nice and soft no frizz or dryness her curls really do look and feels healthy. She has had many comments and compliments. now the best part Very little on your palm goes a long way on your hair. This is almost a concentrated texture shampoo, it rinses out all impurities in her hair. it&#x27;s hard to rate this product on its own because I&#x27;ve never used it alone in my daughter&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ve always used the Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner with it. I would recommend always using the Deep. Conditioner when using this product because the shampoo cleans so thouroughly that you will need to condition it afterwards.  PROS   Cleans Thoroughly without drying her hair out   Great Smell   Lathers Well   Adds Shine   Adds Volume   Gentle   Improves Hair Health  Best Uses   Curly Hair (natural)   Oily Hair   Thicker Hair   Thinner Hair   Dry scalp</li>
    <li> It did the job you have to buy the whole set.great product and good value fir your money must buy</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo, but the conditioner is so thick I can barely get it out of the bottle. I like the detangler spray, but the leave in conditioner doesn&#x27;t really seem to do much and it feels kinda weird in her hair.</li>
    <li> I love these products! My newborn&#x27;s hair smells good for days. Instead of fighting with IG daily, the detangler makes my life so much easier. I only wish the conditioner dispensed through the applicator instead of me having to unscrew the top. Other than that, my baby&#x27;s hair is awesome!</li>
    <li> Not all it is made up to be.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter have a very curly hair and it is always messy!.  This products helps SOME but not the greatest .  We are still looking for a good product to help her hair look neater.</li>
    <li> We started with the leave in and were happy that our daughter&#x27;s hair started looking and feeling more moisturized. We then added the shampoo and about a month later added the conditioner to give her a co-wash after swim lessons. The conditioner left her hair so soft the comb went straight through her hair the first time. I am in love with the rinse out conditioner. I like the shampoo and leave in also, but not as much as the rinse out. A few days ago we added the detangler and have not been happy with it. While her hair doesn&#x27;t look dry it feels brittle. It feels soft right up to the first spray and then it&#x27;s like the moisture has been stripped. I&#x27;ve also noticed more of her hair coming out in the comb and in my fingers. I recommend the first three products, but not the fourth.</li>
    <li> I love the conditioners!!! I hate the spray though, it made my baby girl&#x27;s hair dry. I never used the shampoo and probably won&#x27;t ever since it is not tear free.</li>
    <li> These products work wonders on my son&#x27;s hair! A little bit goes a long way too so these bottles have lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> ... sometimes the bed head really makes her hair crazy. This tames it well without leaving a lot of build up in her hair.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this for my daughters hair since she is mixed!It does work!Which makes me so happy!!!Wish the detangling spray was bigger!But I will definitely be ordering more of this!</li>
    <li> I bought it because I have a girl with curly hair and she wants have her hair flyaway, I used it once and her hair was a litlle harder than normal, but she has the more or less curls definy</li>
    <li> We finally found the best product after 13 yrs.</li>
    <li> Helps with my daughters curly hair.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Wish it had a better fragrance...</li>
    <li> Purchased after visiting and wondered was the child had on her head, it look like a hugh&lt;br /&gt;Afro hat and her hair had to be wash a second time i order to comb.&lt;br /&gt;The toddler has thick  long hair and after the first used hair was manageable with no screaming</li>
    <li> I like how they work, but not how they smell.  Some people might like the smell because it is like candy.</li>
    <li> I can definitely see a difference I. Her hair, they are softer, easier to manage. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product line works great to manage curly and frizzy hair. Gets the tangles out and keeps them out. Costs a little more than the competition but does a great job. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Great product and well worth the investment for your child&#x27;s hair and the product smells great</li>
    <li> Perfect for my son&#x27;s curls</li>
    <li> My wife bought it for our daughter and both my wife and daughter are very happy.</li>
    <li> Products smell great and while they do make it waaaaaay easier to comb my daughters hair, we were quite disappointed that it is still extremely dry.</li>
    <li> nice products will consider purchasing again for natural hair. i like them.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is gets tight springy curls when washed, and when it dries it shrinks up so its really hard to comb out.  When using other shampoo and conditioner its manageable but it still takes time to comb out.  Mixed chicks saved my life!  After about 4-5 washes I saw noticeable differences when combing out her hair after it dried.  It was much straighter when i combed it out and not bouncy as it usually is.  I love everything in this set and will continue to use it because it has saved me time and patience when combing her hair.</li>
    <li> I love these so much! The conditioner and leave in is incredible and I especially love the detangler. This kit is so perfect I think I will continue to buy it instead of the large bottles.</li>
    <li> 13 month old with very curly hair...  works great, makes hair very soft and manageable.  would recommend for mixed kids</li>
    <li> We tried yet another product to help comb out our two-year-old&#x27;s super cute curly hair. We don&#x27;t want her to end up hating her hair because it gets pulled every time her hair is brushed. NONE of these products helped in any way. We know that all hair is different so we moved on to something else. The only thing we have found that does the job for her is Bath &amp; Body Works Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner. It&#x27;s not tear free so we have to be careful, but that, with the Knot Genie Brush, are the only stuff we use now.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for curly hair. It has made life so much easier with my 6 yr old grand daughter and I in the mornings. Her hair is done in half the time and the look last so much longer. I would reccommend this product to any one dealing with lots of curls.</li>
    <li> We are only 2 days in and I am loving this product! Her hair was easier to comb through the next day and her curls looked amazing both days!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing. I love the way it smells and it makes my son&#x27;s hair nice and soft. Great for traveling as well.</li>
    <li> Love the products, just what my grandson needed for his hair. Controls his curls and take away the dryness. With his hair of two different texture this pruduct gave him the balance he needs.</li>
    <li> I am so glad we were able to find this product. It really helps relieve knots and making combing much easier. Also it really defines her curls. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> My daughter has pencil tight curls, and have tried so many different products.  It works better than most products as far as shampoo and conditioner.  Conditioner is so thick I can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle with the pump attachment.  Leave in conditioner is good.  The detangler does not seem to work as well as other products.  Will continue to use but will still be on the search for the best product for her hair.</li>
    <li> I was a bit thrown off with the price of this product at first until it arrived and I used it on my niece for the first time. This stuff is AWESOME! I couldn&#x27;t even think about brushing through her hair without using the detangler! It honestly works miracles for mixed children&#x27;s hair. I was able to brush through it and style without any issue. The leave in conditioner is perfect for the off days that you don&#x27;t wash their hair and it gives their curls beautiful definition! Only issue I had was that I needed a MUCH larger bottle of detangler than I had anticipated. I went through the bottle in the quad pack within 2 weeks. My advice would be to definitely get a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I have a bi-racial daughter (mixed chick) and this is the best stuff i have ever found, after years of trying everything under the sun with no real satisfaction. Mixed Chicks makes her hair so pretty and manageable, minimizing the tangles and dryness. Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my daughters hair feeling sticky and filmy! yuck!</li>
    <li> My daughter is bi-racial and for the past 5yrs of her life I have been on a quest for a hair product that would work for her hair - products designed for Caucasians are too drying and make her hair frizzy and products for African Americans are too heavy and make her hair too oily.  I heard about Mixed Chicks from several people and decided to give it a try - I am so glad that I did!!!  The only down side is that the bottles are relatively small (8oz) and somewhat expensive, but considering how good her hair looks I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Great products.&lt;br /&gt;Really like the detangler.&lt;br /&gt;AG has a fast food that you can find in salons that is a great leave in conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> The product delivered seemed old, really no smell to them and two of the pumps didn&#x27;t work. Still detangles though...</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do!! It&#x27;s amazing. I no longer have hair wars with my daughter lol</li>
    <li> This product is the best for mixed hair.  Just the right amount of conditioning and moisturizing for hair that is in between &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; hair and &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; hair.  I bought this for friends of mine that just adopted a bi-racial child and they love the product and can&#x27;t get over how easy it is to do their son&#x27;s hair, which was a big concern of theirs before they adopted.  Thanks Mixed Chicks!  Your product is sooooo amazing.</li>
    <li> Best products for my daughters hair, soft untangled and manageable. Product last long time. Will continue to purchase for the future</li>
    <li> These hair products are the only way to go for mixed-ethnicity children!  They are very conditioning and the hair looks great after using them, yet they dont create an oily appearance at all.</li>
    <li> This product is a must for mixed girls!! Works better in my daughters hair than anything else we&#x27;ve ever tried....and we&#x27;ve tried a lot!!! Get it!! You will not be sorry!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan on how it leaves my girls hair. It leaves it rough dry feeling yuck</li>
    <li> I purchased this pack originally for my youngest daughter who is almost 2yrs old. She has incredibly curly hair and about a type 3A hair grade. These products have worked beautifully for her hair, not only managing her tangles, but defining her curls too. I also have an 8yr old daughter with the exact opposite hair type, 4B at best (we are transitioning out of the relaxer). The shampoo and conditioner in this pack make her hair incredibly soft as well. Now for me - I have a mixture of type 3C - 4A and it&#x27;s currently cut in a short, above the ear style. These products have also worked very well for me. I&#x27;ve used everything in the pack except the detangler and it keeps my hair smooth and shiny (I have a relaxer)Overall, these are a keeper for me and my girls!</li>
    <li> Got all 4 products for under $40 when each individual product usually goes for about $13.  The only stuff that will work on my daughters hair.  The only problem I have is the containers.  You can&#x27;t get all the product out of the conditioner without getting something else to scrape all the sides.  Otherwise there is a lot left in the container.  Also, the frizz spray tube does not reach to the bottom of the container so there is a lot left in there as well.  You have to be creative to get all of the product out of these.</li>
    <li> We have a mulatto son and his hair is much more in control as well as softer since using this set for 1/2 year now.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I only tried these 4 products one time.  However, I found that my daughters hair was hard to comb out and had a dry lack luster finish when it dried.  I have gone back to our previous shampoo/conditioner along with a leave in oil.</li>
    <li> I have two girls with two different types of hair. They both have curls, but one has really curly hair and the other more waves and occasional spiral at the ends. The detangler is too much for my daughter who&#x27;s hair isn&#x27;t as curly, but a life saver for the curlier hair. This product has saved my kids from getting a really big haircut :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks mixed chicks I love this product!!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy the quad pack again. The shampoo is just ok; the thick conditioner is great; the leave-in is ok; the detangler smells amazing, but it just doesn&#x27;t last (my little guy is able to turn his curls into a frizzy mess as soon as the spray is dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, I&#x27;ll continue buying the conditioner. We&#x27;re still looking for the perfect shampoo (something that will clean his hair without stripping it and drying it horribly), a leave-in option that doesn&#x27;t weigh his curls down, and a detangler that softens his curls and lasts.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money</li>
    <li> Ok, I purchased these products after reading quite a few reviews to make sure this products worked. I personally, don&#x27;t like them. I washed my 20 month old daughter&#x27;s hair, conditioning it , washed that out and the applied the leave in conditioner into my daughters hair it was curly and VERY dry looking. After, the product dries my daughter curls turned into a kinky dry look. I tried, using  the detangler on her hair but it do anything at all. So, I wont be buying these products again. My daughter is biracial, and her hair curls when wet anyways but I was looking for a curly wet look so I wouldn&#x27;t have to do much to her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Monica!</li>
    <li> My daughters are Nigerian-American.  We love what these products do for their hair.  Makes is soft and shiny.  The conditioner instantly softens their hair when we put it in.  Need to use a daily moisturizer on days we don&#x27;t wash their hair to keep it healthy looking.</li>
    <li> My girls&#x27; both have curly hair one more than the other. These products have helped keep their curls and take away tangles. I especially love the detangle spray.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product line. Works way better than the other products out there. Makes my daughter&#x27;s hair so much easier to work with and I really don&#x27;t have to use much of the detangler compared to other detangler products out there - which saves me money! Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My 14 month old son has fuzzy, curly hair right now. Sometimes it just looks like a little baby afro. I needed to try and tame it and I wanted his curls more defined. On the recommendation of a friend, I decided to by the Mixed Chicks products. The shampoo and conditioner work great together. The conditioner especially is very moisturizing. His hair feels like silk when I&#x27;m rinsing it. The leave-in spray is my favorite. It helps define his girls without a bunch of residue left over. Which brings me to the leave-in conditioner. This is the one product that I keep trying but still hate. It makes his hair sticky and then dries hard. Not a fan. Over all, for the other three products, I like it.</li>
    <li> My bi-racial daughter is 3-years-old.  I am caucasian with straight, fine hair and I had no idea how to care for her beautiful hair.  I can&#x27;t believe what I have been going through to try to brush her hair.  A friend recommended this and, because her daughter has beautiful hair similar to my daughter&#x27;s only soft and manageable, I decided to shell out the cash.  OMG!  What a difference.  Immediately, her hair is soft and tangle-free with beautiful, defined curls.  It didn&#x27;t hurt at all for me to brush her hair.  I washed with the shampoo.  Put in the conditioner and brushed it out with the conditioner in her hair (I used the Mixed Chicks brush).  Then rinsed out the conditioner and put in the leave-in-conditioner.  I read that I should not apply that the way I would in my own hair (all-over application at once) and so I tried to do it section by section (starting at the bottom) to really define each natural curl pattern.  It took 3 minutes and it looks amazing!  So easy.  Wish I tried it sooner, glad I found it when she is 3 and not 10!</li>
    <li> Love the conditioners but hate the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it worked great in my daughers hair. I am really in love with the detangle spray.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, worked great on my 1 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Great products!  Makes my daughters hair look healthy and shiny.  Is truly \\&quot;no tears\\&quot; which is nice since I was having to use adult products that would irritate her eyes.  The leave-in conditioner dries soft and controlled without flaking.  I use the detangler between washes and its great but you have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product for my toddler (German &amp; Black American). It left a horrible residue.</li>
    <li> My daughter use this product daily with positive results. I would recommend those who have or know people who have tight heavy curls to use this product. Of course my daughter is mixed and young we all know children hate to sit still but this made easier and quicker to condition and comb her  hair.</li>
    <li> These products were great for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. The detangling spray is just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. I think the best products are the conditioner and leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I had higher hopes but all of the products still dry out my daughters hair. I&#x27;m going to have to find more natural products for her curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product, works really good for my baby&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> Wow!  This really works.  We have tried all sorts of hair products for my mixed race granddaughter, and this one finally gets the tangles out.  No more crying while hair is being washed or brushed!  Thank you, mixed chicks!</li>
    <li> My daughter is half white and half African-American.  I had heard that this brand was great to tame the frizz.  The good part:  the scents are pleasant and not overpowering.  The bad:  we had to use pump after pump and spray after spray of all products just to get her hair somewhat moisturized.  I was so disappointed.  I don&#x27;t know if the regular Mixed Chicks products (not just for kids) would work better.  I might try those.  Overall these were unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is the best product that I have found that works on my twins&#x27; hair.  Especially my daughters.  She loves to wear her hair down, and before I would always try to get her to wear it up.  But even after the first use you could tell the difference in her hair. Simply amazing.</li>
    <li> My daughter is 2 and is half black and filipino. She has very curly/kinkly beautiful hair and lots of it! The product makes her hair a very dry and doesn&#x27;t feel as soft. The cream is nice but a little on the sticky side. I feel like the spritz makes her curls even curlier and it&#x27;s tough to put her hair in a pony tail. I can only give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading great/positive reviews right here on amazon for my 4 year old daughter who is Black &amp; Puerto Rican just like myself.  Her hair is always messy in general!  Very MESSY!  I thought this product would tame the frizzies and enhance the curls but sadly it did not.  It smelled kinda funny and was a little sticky on my hands.  I tried like 3 days in a row and it was official that this product was not for my baby.  It did nothing for the frizz factor &amp; nothing for the curls.  I was a little disappointed but I had no problem returning the product.</li>
    <li> I chose three stars just because I do not care for the de-tangler provided in the quad pack. It made my daughter&#x27;s hair sticky and unmanageable.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!!  Takes the frizzies out and leaves beautiful waves!</li>
    <li> I like this for my mixed kids hair...but the quantity is not enough. Mix kids have a lot of hair...and I have two, so buying this at 50 bucks it not budget friendly. I wont buy again..too expensive.</li>
    <li> The only products that seem to tame the long hair of my mixed race God child. Long lasting, good smelling product; eliminated a lot of the &amp;#34;hair battles&amp;#34; between her and mom.</li>
    <li> I was pleases with the product, I assumed it would be bigger in size. I bought the items for my nine year old. I should have paid attention to the size because she has lots of hair. I did not care for the detangler</li>
    <li> Deva curl seemed to work much better. Bought this because deva is very strong smelling. But the mixed chicks shampoo dries out my daughters hair which makes it really frizzy. Sticking with Deva curl</li>
    <li> These products were recommended to me by a hair dresser for my daughter. I was hesitant because of the price, but I figured I&#x27;d try it just once. Well now I won&#x27;t use anything else for my daughters hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has beautiful curly hair that can get VERY big if I don&#x27;t put the right products in it, but I hated putting mousse or creams in her hair because she&#x27;s only 4! I love that I can wet her hair and put in the leave in conditioner cream and that&#x27;s all I need! And it lasts all day with no flaking or crunchy hair! The only small thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell of the detangling spray. It&#x27;s not my favorite, but other than that I LOVE LOVE LOVE these products!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my daughter</li>
    <li> While the products are fine, it was advertised as having no alcohol.  This is not true.  There is alcohol in the conditioner.  I had gotten this specifically for the &amp;#34;no alcohol&amp;#34;.  Other products work fine...</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with dry curly hair. I like it but don&#x27;t LOVE it. The detangling spray works pretty well but it almost seems to dry my daughters hair out a little. I really like the smell, it&#x27;s soft and disappears. She&#x27;s not sensitive to smells but I am and these don&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s good but I still have to use Argan Oil (Agadir Argan Oil is AMAZING!). The shampoo seems gentle enough and also seems to clean well. Overall I&#x27;m pleased and would probably buy these again individually (except maybe the leave in conditioner b/c I use their regular rinse out conditioner as a leave in.</li>
    <li> I have never bought any shampoo that cost as much as this but on friends recommendation I got it for baby.  Her hair looks wonderful and is very manageable.</li>
    <li> makes hair managable while not drying out natural curls of my daughters hair who happens to be a mixed chick. (black &amp; purto rican)</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my God-daughter.  Nothing worked prior to using this product.  Mixed chicks worked miracles!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did wish that there was a moisturizer in the pack.</li>
    <li> This hair system for our little one&#x27;s hair (we have both mixed boys and girls) is great.  If you&#x27;re searching for hair products for your children, this whole system has done wonders for our kids&#x27; dry hair problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the simple packaging and the contents of each bottle are great; the one downside is the price tag!  I am going to try to find an alternative if I cannot find it cheaper elsewhere.  It&#x27;s difficult to justify $40 for hair stuff for our kids...though it has lasted about 6 months already.</li>
    <li> This takes care of all tangles and dry hair in the back of head! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great products. But one of the conditioner top was broken. Unhappy about the lid on 1 of the products was broken. But great buy.Also these products were shipped on time.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is a mixed chicklet and my daughter says that this product works very well on my granddaughter&#x27;s fine, very curly hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick, kinky curls and she is so sensitive to doing her hair. Mixed chicks product works great because the smell made yer get excited, the push pump feature is less messy than turning it upside down so I felt like I was at a hair salon and the product works, especially the conditioners....I even start using it on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 2 biracial daughters. The shampoo and conditioner are ok, not much different from any other product I have used. The fragrance is nice and it is gentle on their hair. The detangling spray works well and also has a nice fragrance, however the spray bottle didn&#x27;t work and I had to transfer it to another bottle. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase these products in the future. Just not worth the extra expense.</li>
    <li> Great products,  worked wonderfully on my twins hair.  No more frizzy afro, but beautiful spiral curls and waves and very manageable</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo / conditioner I have found for my 2 year old daughters hair. I shampoo right as she gets in the tub &amp; then put the conditioner in while she plays.  After about 5-10 minutes I comb it thru with a wide tooth comb.  This is the only baby. / kid shampoo that has helped with her curly hair that gets knotted easily.  Then I rinse &amp; put a little leave in conditioner. The conditioning spray is great to use when she wakes up.  All of the products smell good.  I have tried many baby shampoos ( for curly hair) and this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> Liked but just the regular Mixed Chicks worked better..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my biracial (half black, half white) 20month old daughter after her father reccomended it. I never thought her hair was too unmanagable to begin with but i took his advice and bought this after reading the amazing reviews. I immediately used the shampoo/conditioner on her hair and put in the leave in conditioner as well... her hair looked exactly the same as it did with any other shampoo/conditioner i&#x27;ve used. The detangler leaves a weird feeling on the hair and the leave-in conditioner just made her hair hard.. i&#x27;ll continue to used the shampoo/conditioner since it was so expensive but i would not reccommend this product and I will not be making another purchase.</li>
    <li> my daughter is biracial and have thick curly hair. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference between mixed chicks and Johnson Johnson detangler and their leave In conditioner. From using mixed chicks for a month now...My daughter&#x27; s hair still gets&#x27; dry and tangled...still have  to comb her hair everyday. The only mixed chick product I like from this pack, is the leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it was a waste of money for overpriced brand.</li>
    <li> I love the conditioners and the spray. The conditioners  are fragrance free but the shampoo and the spray are not. I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo because it burned our eyes. My daughter has eczema a so we couldn&#x27;t continue to use the shampoo. It does smell nice though like oranges. The spray smells nice too and works great but again we can&#x27;t use it due to the fragrance. Great conditioners!! You can order samples on mixed chicks website to see if you like it.</li>
    <li> My 2-year-old daughter has 3C/4A hair, and while we&#x27;ve liked some of the Aveda products we&#x27;ve used, the Mixed Chicks is by far THE BEST thing we&#x27;ve ever used. This quad pack is the way to go. Her curls are defined but not crunchy. After she&#x27;s slept on her hair all night, it&#x27;s slightly messy but not bad at all. The only thing I need to do to refresh her style is spritz on some of the detangler and quickly brush it out. It takes less than 3 minutes. LOVE it! Plus, it smells really good and she gets very excited when it&#x27;s time to wash her hair or spray on the detangler. Highly recommend this. Totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product. It did absolutely no good for my granddaughters hair. Very big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have a mixed son and he is tem months old with extremely long cury hair. I haved used other detanglers and other products this by far is the best leaves no residue ok on the eyes during wash and condition and the leave in conditioner is worth gold. Very effective product</li>
    <li> This product has made a huge difference for my daughters hair.  My Daughter is mixed black/white and has extreamly curly hair.  This has made her hair soft and defined her curls!  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> THIS SUCKED!  MY DAUGHTER IS 18 MONTHS AND MIXED!!  HER SCALP AFTER ONE WEEK WAS DRY AND ITCHY!  HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN 18 MONTH OLD SCRATCHING ALL DAY?  NOT GOOD!  I JUST THREW ALL THIS CRAP OUT WITH THE REST OF THE GARBAGE!  I DIDN&#x27;T WANT MY MONEY BACK EITHER!! I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!  AND YES I AM A BLACK FEMALE SO I KNOW BLACK HAIR!  I SWITCHED BACK TO CAROL&#x27;S DAUGHTER!</li>
    <li> I really love theses products. it fits perferctly for both my daugters that has different type of hair. really love it.</li>
    <li> Hard to comb hair, this works great, I use it on my granddaughter, who&#x27;s hair is tight curls, after a wash and condition a comb goes right threw. I will continue to buy and use . Worth every penny, love it</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my daughter hair 👎</li>
    <li> It is not better than any other products for mixed girls hair.&lt;br /&gt;And most other products are cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best deal for me!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is biracial, age 6.My dtr in law was having a time keeping her hair neat. Granted she has beautiful hair, but it IS a different texture than her oldest  daughters hair, who is not biracial. In any black neighborhood my granddaughters hair  would be called \\&quot;good\\&quot; hair. Anyway, her hair is now soft,shiny and easy to keep up. It has also been used on her 18 month old sisters hair. I plan on keeping a steady shipment going to my granddaughter. A fantastic product. A bit expensive but very  worth it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like that this pack came with all the product that I needed bundled. I also like that it is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is much softener.</li>
    <li> This product works \\&quot;ok\\&quot;. Not as amazing as the reviews make it seem. Not aa spectacular as indicated. It helps maintain the hair at some level but it doesn&#x27;t transform hair into something better.</li>
    <li> We purchased this a a beauty supply store near us and loved it. Despite the name, it works great on boys hair too. No frizzes and smells wonderful. We get compliments all the time on how beautiful our sons hair is.</li>
    <li> My son is mixed and we had shard time finding something that worked with his hair. This leaves it feeling soft instead of crunchy and keeps the frizz down without being oily.</li>
    <li> After just one use my daughters curls were looking fabulous! HOWEVER, the packaging it was sent in was NOT good. There were product leaks and everything was wet and gross. Plus that results in less product being available for use.So definitely disappointed in the packaging/delivery.</li>
    <li> my child is mixed with black, white and hispanic. I love mixed chicks. it smells great too. it is really the only thing ill buy for her hair. it also gets the knots and tangles out very well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for our hair.</li>
    <li> We mostly use the shampoo and conditioner, but I love Mixed Chicks brand.  My sons hair is so much more manageable now that we use this stuff.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price! I did not notice anything special or different in my son&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
    <li> Leave in conditioner is the only one worth buying...the detangler is useless for us, the shampoo is the only one that is toted as tear free...beware!</li>
    <li> This product saved me from the cries of my daughter its very good for African American hair.</li>
    <li> I finally found the perfect combination shampoo, condition and leave in conditioner that works wonders on my daughter&#x27;s hair and they smell great too!!</li>
    <li> I love this!  My daughter has a lot of hair and its so much easier now to brush or comb her hair.</li>
    <li> The product is suitable for little girls.  I agree with some of the other reviews, the leave-in conditioner does tend to get dry rather quickly.  However, I think the shampoo and conditioner left my 2 year olds hair feeling softer than the run of the mill baby shampoo.  It is a little pricey, so I think I will try to buy the shampoo and conditioner in bigger sizes and use the adults Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Waste of money made my daughters big bouncy curls very dry and hard made her hair tangled her $2.00 bottle of suave detangler worked better. Very dissatisfied and disappointed for how much we paid....I&#x27;d like my money back...ill never buy this again coconut oil works much better.</li>
    <li> I have a 5 month old son. I am white and his father is African-American. So unfortunately, neither of us knew too much about how to take care of his ethnic hair. I did my research and found out about Mixed Chicks. I condition his hair every day when I bathe him. I only wash it once a week. His hair has gotten so much softer. I found out that washing too often can dry his hair out. Plus, I was using Johnson&#x27;s head-to-toe. I know better now! And thanks to Mixed Chicks, I reversed the problem! Mixed Chicks works for boys too! Another great product for a cheaper price is Mixtina products. They make Coily Curls &amp; Wavy Curls products for different ethnicities.</li>
    <li> It Dries My Girls Hair out.. I have tried using less product , But with their &amp;#34;very fine curl&amp;#34; hair type it not the product for me</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  It&#x27;s lasts forever too so it being incredibly pricey is actually not too bad since it seems to last as long as 4x of the cheaper stuff that wasn&#x27;t as good.  It really does wonders for my curly haired child&#x27;s hair, and the detangler is nice.  I have not used the wash out conditioner yet but the leave in conditioner is great.</li>
</ol>
