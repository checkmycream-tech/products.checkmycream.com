<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Removed approx. 1/2 color but was enough to recolor.</li>
    <li> This stuff reeks of used condom, damaged the hell out of my hair, and didn&#x27;t change the color (black) in the slightest. I&#x27;m out of fifteen bucks, and my hair feels like hay, even after a coconut oil mask. Do not use, I am extremely upset, my hair smells like fried feces, and I would give zero stars if possible.</li>
    <li> DISGUSTING!!! It mostly faded but did nt completely the hair color. Not to mention THE SMELL!! The smell lingered throughout the house for DAYS. 4-5 washes in, my hair still smells!!! The smell is so strong and nauseating! Suck up the bad hair color!</li>
    <li> Did not work to get black dye out of my hair, even though I haven&#x27;t dyed it in a few months.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked great. I&#x27;d gone super red and it just didn&#x27;t look right on me, plus my roots were bright pink, which... no... do not like. I used this product and then dyed my hair light neutral brown and it worked great. Yes, you can smell the sulfur for a long time afterwards but it&#x27;s worth it if you hate your current dye job, as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s one thing to be aware of: the mix is super liquid! I mean, like no thicker than skim milk. If you&#x27;re like me and have dyed your hair at home for a long time, this is a shock to your normal routine. I got it everywhere. It&#x27;s super runny and does NOT thicken like hair dye. Just thought I&#x27;d warn you.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, it stripped the brown dye off my naturally strawberry blond hair and the hair felt good after. I did use a hot oil treatment afterwards but it&#x27;s optional. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me one bit despite what other reviews say, boxed hair color smells much stronger.  I followed instructions to take my time rinsing the hair out and I believe it is an important step for the product to work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Looks like it&#x27;s worked on some people but it hardly changed my hair at all. Still looks pretty much exactly the same and I followed directions exactly. I put a cheaper box of dye down to get this and that was a huge mistake. Wont be buying again, I definitely learned my lesson. Just made my hair smell bad</li>
    <li> I wanted to strip my black dye off my hair, so I purchased opps and it works. I had to purchase 2 of them because I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair black for a long time and it didn&#x27;t strip it all off on the first one but the second time it worked. I must say that this stuff smells bad and even after you wash your hair it still stinks. It takes about three different days of washing before the smell is completely off.</li>
    <li> One thing that I didn&#x27;t know until I had bought and opened the product, &amp;#34;Color Oops is not designed for and will not perform on direct color dyes such as bright pinks, blues, greens, lavendars, purples, etc.&amp;#34; I had red in my hair, and it turned it into a dark purple color. I was hoping that it would just take the red out and leave me with my weird orangy-bleached hair color so I could re-color it. I had to go to the salon to get it fixed. Here are my before and after pictures.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair dark reddish brownish black for many years, and it&#x27;s always been lighter and brighter on top than at the middle and bottom--which I hated! It had been about 5 weeks since my last at-home coloring, and I was tired of the uneven results so I wanted to try this product to attempt to get a more even result the next time I colored. My hair is VERY fine and can&#x27;t take the abuse of bleach, so honestly I was slightly terrified to try this. But I&#x27;m glad I did. Even though I have long hair, one box was enough. I started at the ends and went up to the roots. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it smelled good, but it was not nearly as strong as many other hair colors I&#x27;ve used. As it was processing I was nervous that it would get too light so I rinsed it out after 15 minutes instead of 20. (I probably should have done the strand test beforehand). I was surprised at how well it took the color out (I followed the rinsing and conditioning instructions). It was no where near my natural color (which is an ashy light brown) except at my roots which were unchanged, but I didn&#x27;t expect it return my hair to its natural color anyway. The result on my colored hair was a an orangey-blonde color; but it was still brighter on top of my head and probably 1-2 shades darker near the ends and underneath. I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t turn out more even. But the next day it was a little less bright on top--thank goodness. I read another review that said she let the mixture process on her ends for 10 minutes before applying to the rest of her hair and now I wish I would have done that.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 3 or 4 times in the past few years, and it works fantastically. It removes the darkest colors, right down to the tips of my hair which have several layers of different hair color accumulated on them. Does it smell? YES. The smell is pretty awful, and this last time was the worst. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula slightly or if it was just me, but it hung around for a few days, despite repeated washing. So yeah, be prepared for that. Also, if you&#x27;ve used any hair color that had any lightening agents in it at all, you will end up with a brassy tone after the color is removed. The product removes all artificial color, but it cannot redeposit color that has been previously bleached out. Even if you&#x27;ve only tried to go a shade lighter or redder, you will have this issue. Be prepared to re-color with an ash-toned or &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; color. Also, if you&#x27;re going to recolor your hair within a few days of using Color Oops, use a shade at least 2 shades lighter than what you want the result to be. The shaft of your  hair will be wide open and will suck up color like a sponge. This past time I wanted a light medium brown, so I colored my hair with a box of dark ash blonde. The directions also say to use a deep conditioner after using Color Oops, and I would second that. While my hair wasn&#x27;t wrecked, it was markedly drier.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great product. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to fix a coloring mistake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 boxes one at night and one the next morning. My hair is now a brassy orange/red. It looks terrible &amp; was isn&#x27;t anywhere near where I wanted it. I followed everyones tips and read all the reviews. I am very frustrated. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product out of desperation a week after a bad dye job.  I was hesitant to put anything else on my hair, fearing more damage, but couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased by the results.  The process is a little time consuming, but WELL worth it!!  Not only did all the dye dissolve from my hair, but my hair was not damaged at all.  Beware: the smell is a bit strong, like that of a perm, but it does go away after shampooing.  Be sure to use a good conditioner afterwards.  I used Nutrogena Triple Action conditioner, left it on my hair for 5 minutes.  My hair is shiny, feels soft, and looks really healthy.  THANK YOU to whomever created this miracle dye-removing product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I was extremely skeptical at first, but decided I had nothing to lose. I dyed my hair Manic Panic&#x27;s Atomic Turquoise a week ago and got sick of the color really quickly. I bought some Color Oops, but when I got home and read the directions it clearly says it will not work on bright pinks, blues, greens or purples, but I did a test strip and it worked! And quickly too. It smells, but not as bad as bleach. It&#x27;s very easy to use. It didn&#x27;t itch or irritate my scalp and there was no visible damage. I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but this stuff is amazing. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now used this product a few times, and have learned:    1.  When they say rinse, RINSE!  The package says it will undo hair color in 20 minutes, but that&#x27;s just the application time.  You&#x27;ll easily spend another half hour or more just rinsing your hair.  The rinsing is very, very important, as it removes the old hair dye molecules from the hair shaft.  If you don&#x27;t rinse enough, those molecules will stay on your hair, waiting to re-oxidize (and there are lots of things out there, not just peroxide, that will \\&quot;oxidize\\&quot; those molecules, turning your hair dark).  So RINSE...until you think your arms are going to fall off.    2.  You&#x27;ll need to seal the hair shaft afterwards, some how, some way.  There will be some stubborn old dye molecules still stuck to your hair (especially if you didn&#x27;t rinse as much as necessary), and you do not want to reactivate them, or your hair will return to the color you were trying to get rid of.  So, you&#x27;ll want to create some sort of barrier between those old molecules and anything that can possibly oxidize them.  That means lots of protein products, and lots and lots of conditioning.</li>
    <li> I was soooo excited to take the color out of my hair, I&#x27;ve had it since October, and it is now December. Color Oops says it will take it out if it is a day, or a year old, so that shouldn&#x27;t matter anyway.     I googled ways to get rid of the color, vinegar, crappy shampoo, and Color Oops were all recommended. Color Oops had AMAZING reviews, and those that seemed bad, seemed like it was the users fault. I waited two weeks before finally being brave enough to go and get some, but I couldn&#x27;t find it at Sally&#x27;s, WalMart, Target, etc. I finally found some at Walgreens, and I bought two boxes (thick, long hair) I applied it, did EVERYTHING the box said to, I washed it really good because everyone seemingly said that that part was very, very important.     Nothing.    I&#x27;m now out $26, with my hair untouched. ABSOLUTELY UNTOUCHED. It didn&#x27;t do a THING to it. I&#x27;m absolutely disappointed. I&#x27;ve contacted DeveloPlus explaining my situation, I will follow up IF they reply.    I envy those of you who this worked for :/ I wish I had that luck.</li>
    <li> my hair was dyed dark brown and I wanted to use this to lift it a couple shades closer to my natural color (dark blonde) so I could color it again. I followed the instructions (lots of waiting and rinsing) and ended up with...dark brown. At most about 1/2 a shade lighter. The only thing I got out of this was a stinky bathroom and hair that felt like yarn. I definitely do not recommend using this, I&#x27;ve tried other color removers that work a lot better. Maybe if your hair is not a super dark shade it would lighten better but overall a giant waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Everyone keeps talking about the rinse rinse rinsing. Well, why don&#x27;t you just use some of the shampoo&#x27;s that stop and get all the molecules out of the hair in the shampoo. I have used DeveloPlus Chemical De-Activating Shampoo for years. Stops the processing and get all the chemicals out. Anyone have any other ideas? I rated because I had too post this question. I will rate after tryng Oops.&lt;br /&gt;tks</li>
    <li> Color Oops took my hair from a horrid purple burgundy to a light copper red (I&#x27;m blonde naturally).  The burgundy was supposed to only be some low lights but the salon had put too much in my hair and I looked like something out of a Halloween movie for the last 2 weeks!  It is now much better as I am now blonde with coppery low lights.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the stuff stinks, but it also works to get rid of very dark frightening hair dye.  One also has to follow the instructions completely even though the rinsing part is very tedious and turns you into a prune.&lt;br /&gt;My thought is that the folks who used it and found the color back when they woke in the morning, didn&#x27;t follow the rinsing instructions.  I washed 4 times and rinsed, while scrubbing very hard, the full 5 minutes each time.  Also, this product will not correct a bad lightening nor will it work on the new fangled colors which are not used with a lifter originally, lifter being a peroxide.  It has to be oxidized coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product and now know that I cannot have any salon do anything to my hair from here on out.  Thank you Clairol!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally a dark brown, I have dyed it many times and more recently I dyed it a much lighter redish light brown. Then, wanting my old color back, I used garnier natural dark brown which turned my hair a hideous jet black. I came across this product and used it the next day. The smell isn&#x27;t even that bad and it worked great! My hair is now restored the the red light brown it was before. Great product.</li>
    <li> I used the new John Frieda foam hair color in a lovely light brown shade, my natural color.  I needed to color my grays. Well, to my utter shock &amp; disbelief, the color turned my hair dark, dark brown which looked plum in the sunlight.  I was horrified. I have never, ever worn my hair this dark in my life.  So, I remembered seeing a coupon for Color Oops and found some at the local retailer.  I bought the &#x27;extra strength&#x27; version as that is all they carried.      First, if you buy this product, be prepared as it has tons of directions and hints.  It takes time to sort through them and you&#x27;ll likely want to read them several times before you even consider beginning.  When I mixed the two chemicals together, I immediately thought it smelled like a home perm.  It&#x27;s stinky, but in a milder way.  It stinks, but it worked.  Probably the worst part about this product is the rinsing. But, do it.  It works.  When I was done, my hair was back to its normal color AND my grays were still covered.  I did have really bad split ends though, which I admit I had before I used this product, but it definitely made them worse and much more noticable.  And, that perm smell was still around two days later.  Thankfully, I had an appointment for a haircut a few days later &amp; the split ends are gone now.  I&#x27;m going to be using a heavy conditioner for at least the next few weeks to restore the moisture back to my hair. But, if I had it to do all over again, I would still buy this product.  It truly works.</li>
    <li> okay so i purchased this at a local walgreens since it was easier, and i had blue dye in my very lightly bleached blonde hair and this helped to remove most of it. there is still a hint of a light blue-ish hue but i like it so i dont care.&lt;br /&gt;!!!!warning!!!! this stuff is rank smelling like my whole house smelled like rotten eggs for more than a day. so my suggestion is if you can get someone to help you put this on but outside and then dispose of the remaining contents to outside garbage, and until its ready to wash out just sit outside until you rinse it out. trust me it will help also be ready to spend a lot of time rinsing this out it takes more then one shampoo-ing to get the smell off my hair. just wash your hair with a couple different shampoo&#x27;s if you can and it should help get rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;also make sure you use a conditioner so your hair doesn&#x27;t get too dry. good luck</li>
    <li> I used this product 2 weeks ago, and I absolutely recommend it.    I have brown hair with some gray, and I dyed my hair too dark - it was supposed to be dark brown, but it came out black. I waited a month for it to fade, but it didn&#x27;t. Finally, I tried Color Oops, and it worked perfectly.     I followed the directions exactly and even tacked on an extra 5 full minutes of rinsing. My hair was kind of an ashy blond color (lighter than natural color) for about 12 hours, but then it darkened to brown - exactly my natural shade.    My hair was dry for a day or two, but not bad. And I can still smell the terrible Color Oops smell a little bit sometimes (like, when I am washing my hair). But I would absolutely recommend this 100%.</li>
    <li> This product removed the excess color from the ends of my hair, but the sulphur smell lingered even after washing several times. To get rid of the rotten egg smell I opened up 10 vitamin C capsules and combined the powder with shampoo to create a paste and then washed my hair with it. After washing I rinsed my hair with hot water really well BEFORE using conditioner. I think it&#x27;s really important to rinse well before using conditioner which seals the cuticle of the hair. Hope this helps those who are sick of the awful smell.</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair at home for almost 20 years and have generally stuck with the same product &amp; colors.  Any time that I have strayed from the tried &amp; true, a disaster has ensued... which has usually been correctable after a 911 call placed to the product hotline.  Recently, however, I tried a Garnier product that looked very similar to my usual Clairol auburn shade, only to have my hair turn a hideous FUSCIA-MAGENTA!?  I tried reapplying my usual shade over it, which did even out the color, but it was really dark with fuscia-magenta accents - YUCK!  I went online to look for another solution, read about OOPS, and gave it a shot.  I followed the instructions very carefully and EVERY TRACE of color came out, leaving me with an even, strawberry blonde base to re-color.  THIS STUFF WORKS!!!  NOTE: be sure to follow all directions, including the ones that tell you how to condition your hair, choose a lighter shade when re-coloring, &amp; ONLY allowing the new color to process for 5 MINUTES before rinsing (or you will wind up having dark hair again &amp; repeating the whole process!)</li>
    <li> Ok so I read all these reviews and looked on youtube for video reviews and decided to just go for it. I had dyed my hair red about 4 times and was just tired of the upkeep and not finding a box color that was as awesome as the stylist&#x27;s color. I want to go back to a more natural color so I don&#x27;t have to worry about roots so much and I didn&#x27;t want to keep putting dye on it and I definitely didn&#x27;t want to bleach the hell out of it because that&#x27;s why I went red in the first place, to stop the blonde damage. From the other reviews and my experience I&#x27;m going to safely say that if you&#x27;re currently red, used to be blonde and use Color Oops, your hair is going to turn...pumpkin spice, is the best color I can think of. It&#x27;s not horrible, and I&#x27;ve heard that the color tends to change a day or 2 in so I&#x27;m letting my hair rest before I re-dye it a very light ash blonde since I want a medium ash result.  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! I&#x27;m so tired of hearing bad reviews or mixed reviews when the person didn&#x27;t even do exactly what the directions said to do! Work quickly to put it on your hair then leave it on for 20 minutes, shampoo then rinse your hair for 20 mins and then shampoo and rinse for another 5+ minutes, then use a good conditioner. My hair felt pretty decent and I used an overnight repair serum before I went to bed just as an extra precaution. The directions even give you caution and advice on how to re-dye your hair because your hair will be really porous. A neutral protein filler at Sally&#x27;s is decently priced and you get more than one use out of it plus you can use it as a once a week conditioner (you&#x27;ll need to buy a spray bottle in order to use it). It states in the directions that it does not work on fantasy colors and do not use heat or cool air while it&#x27;s processing.  It did what I expected and I&#x27;m fairly happy with the results. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is only due to the smell, and I didn&#x27;t really mind it considering it&#x27;s a small price to pay to get this redout.</li>
    <li> I was attempting to remove very dark brown dye from my blonde hair. The 1st and 2nd treatment of color oops didn&#x27;t do anything, even though I followed the directions word-for-word. My 3rd attempt finally yielded results. It took my hair from very dark brown to light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what made the difference the 3rd time around:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Apply quickly&amp;#34; really means get in it your hair as fast as humanly possible. Once it&#x27;s mixed it begins to lose effectiveness. You need to get it on your hair ASAP to get really good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Stay out of a draft&amp;#34; really means sit in front of a heater. You will need to keep your hair WARM to get good results while you use color oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Rinse well&amp;#34; really means don&#x27;t bother using Color Oops unless you&#x27;re going to rinse for at least 25 minutes under warm water. No cheating. 20 minutes of rinsing won&#x27;t cut it. Also, don&#x27;t use cold water, it won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out later that the reason I had such a difficult time was because I used a cheap/bad dye. If you used a really cheap dye, your going to have a hard time. My hair stylist said that cheap dyes are nearly impossible to remove without bleaching, even for them. I give this product 5 stars because once I figured out how to use it, it worked well enough and I was able to avoid beaching my hair.</li>
    <li> Okay-my natural color hair is dark brown--I am half portugese, so its pretty dark. Over the years I have had highlights put in here and there and in the fall I usually put a brown dye in it for the winter months. In May I put highlights in that turned a dark strawberry blond and then in June went to do it again and it was too much. Most of the top of my hair was a strawberry blonde and the roots were dark and the old part that had grown out was an orange color--not good. So I got a dark color from the beauty supply and it turned black and not a good black. It was black and in some areas it had a blue tint. I washed my hair with dawn dish soap for a few days and was out in the sun and the black was not fading but some strands were getting more blue. Every morning when I looked in the mirror I wanted to cry. I havn&#x27;t felt like this about my hair since high school. This morning I got online and read about color oops and I was hesitant but I kept reading---then I thought well, my hair will probably turn out orange, but orange is better than black with a blue tint--so off to the store I went. I bought a box of light brown hair dye just in case the orange was a little much. Anyways I followed the directions and when its all said and done, my hair turned out BEAUTIFUL!! The black is gone. The bluish greenish color is gone! I decided not to even put the light brown dye in. My hair has not looked this good in years. Honestly! The smell is like sulfer and even as I type, I can smell it, but that is nothing compared to having goth hair. I could not have planned this better if I tried. I never write reviews but I know that when it comes to things like hair color its always good to know how to get out of a mess sometimes. And dark hair I think is a little bit harder to dye than blonde because of the ash tones and red tones. I hope you find this review helpful and I guess you just have to weigh your options, and for me, red would have been a lot better than black/blue. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde and dyed my hair RED for Halloween. After the party, I went to dark auburn. I have used dark auburn before and typically it fades from my hair pretty quickly. This time, it didn&#x27;t thanks to the bright red underneath. I decided to give this a shot to get the funky maroon it tuned into out. It DOES lighten - but do not expect to get to your natural hair color. If you do, consider you one of the lucky ones! I ended up doing two applications and got it to orange.   Reds seem to always be difficult to counteract - my solution was to go out &amp; get a dark ash blonde to tone down the orange.   It is nice to have a product to lighten your hair that is without bleach. Trying this with bleach probably would have destroyed my hair.  The smell, yeah, it smells. But honestly it was the hair dye that made my eyes water. It wasn&#x27;t as bad as I was expecting.    So did it strip some of the color out of my hair? Yes.  Did it restore my natural hair color prior to the dye? No - not even after two applications AND following the 20 minute rinse instructions.  Did I have to re-dye it to get the funky color out? Yes.  So yes, it does somewhat what it advertises, but don&#x27;t count on it to be your one shot cure. Be prepared for orange or something else depending on your hair type &amp; dye color you are looking to get out. I didn&#x27;t get my natural hair color back, and still have some red in it, but it is lighter and more of a natural color that I can definitely work with - and my hair feels very soft &amp; silky.</li>
    <li> I used this after coloring my hard a deep red/brown. I liked the color, but wanted to go back to my original. I used this in hopes of removing the dye. It did, but left my hair brassy and unnatural looking. As the label warns, your resulting color is whatever is left of your original color after the dye strips it. My hair was slightly damaged after using it, but should be alright after a bit of deep conditioning. The semi-permanent dye I purchased to color my hair with after using this product stuck as well as Color Oops said it would, and the color is definitely darker than the box. Overall, it did it&#x27;s job but I am knocking one star off for the TERRIBLE sewage-like smell that it gives off and leaves both in your hair and in the space in which you used it, and I am knocking off another because they claim to bring you back to your \\&quot;natural\\&quot; color, but only mention INSIDE the box that you may never get your natural color back as the dye used may have ruined it. It&#x27;s a bit misleading.</li>
    <li> Long story, short: I&#x27;ve been dyeing my naturally dark blonde hair dark brown hair for quite a while now (like, years!), but wanted to go back to blonde.  I thought I would try Color Oops, and if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d resort to bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after two applications, I managed to get up to a nice, warm light-brown color!  My hair was dry, but not super damaged.  From there, I was able to bleach just once back up to blonde.  A month has gone by and I&#x27;m still blonde!  It&#x27;s slightly brassy, but I&#x27;m using all those blue products, which is keeping it in check.  Oh, and my hair is far less damaged than if I had tried to bleach from dark brown up to blonde!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to write this review it two parts. I will come back and update in a couple days. Because your hair darkens after using it.    I am a natural golden blonde, fair skinned gal with light green eyes. One day being a little bored and looking to change my look (as well as save money) I decided to dye my hair Loreal Medium Golden Brown. Mistake #1. My hair turned too orange/brassy. I should&#x27;ve picked an ash or neutral shade to tone down the gold in my hair. So wanting to change it a little darker and make my eyes stand out, I chose a non-permanent dark burgundy so it could fade out if I didn&#x27;t like it. Mistake #2. This made me look older and was not at all flattering with my skin tone.     Enter the Color Oops. After reading literally 100&#x27;s of reviews on this site as well as Walgreen&#x27;s (they have over 400 reviews there), I felt I had enough info, tips and courage to try the Color Oops. I purchased 2 boxes because I have thick hair to the middle of my back. Did a patch test to see if I was allergic. I also did a strand test a couple days before using it on my head. I mixed an equal capful of each 2 oz bottle and did a 15 minute and a 20 minute test on strands. I gave myself a haircut a couple days earlier after the dye jobs so I used this hair.     The strands looked like they had almost all of the color removed and were very blonde with the solution. I washed/rinsed and put them aside noticing the next day they darkened up quite a bit, to a dark blonde almost brunette but without red tones.    I still went ahead and used the Color Oops. Bring a radio to listen to while in bathroom/shower because using this product takes some time. I mixed first bottle and applied to head. It&#x27;s very runny and be careful shaking it gently, gasses build up in bottle and spray out a little when you open it. Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes! I used almost both bottles, one would not have been enough for my head. I also kept my hair untangled and combed it with a comb to apply the product evenly. Then I used a shower cap and timed it for 20 minutes. I made sure there were no drafts and I sat in a warm room. The smell was not as bad as people were saying. One girl in her review wrote it smells like \\&quot;lemon fart\\&quot;. Perfect description! I thought Yellowstone hot springs were bad, but honestly I don&#x27;t think Color Oops smelled as awful as I&#x27;d expected.    After 20 minutes I got into shower and I rinsed it from hair, shampooed/rinsed/shampooed, then rinsed for 20 minutes with very warm water. Rinsing is key. This was actually the worst part for me. I wanted the water to be very warm/hot, cold would close the hair shaft and you won&#x27;t be able to rinse dye molecules out. I actually felt like I was going to pass out (kinda scary) from the heat and smell together and 20 minutes is a long time. Radio helps.    After all of that I applied Original Hair Mayonnaise Conditioner and sat for 20 minutes with it on my hair. Then rinsed some more.     When I towel dried hair I noticed almost all color was removed, roots were brassy/light blonde and ends were dark blonde/light brunette.  I was happy it was almost back to normal.    It has now been an hour and my hair has darkened up almost to the color it was before this whole ordeal. It has less burgundy but it is a reddish brunette color. The ends are dark and roots are still orangey/brassy, like a copper penny. Wonderful? Not so much. But my hair feels healthy like before, doesn&#x27;t feel damaged. But I always use lots of shower conditioner and leave in conditioners. It also doesn&#x27;t smell sulfury anymore, maybe just when it&#x27;s wet.    So I will wait a couple days before I use any more products to try to fix my hair. I also think it will darken up some more. Honestly girls, if you have gorgeous hair to begin with, don&#x27;t mess with it! But if you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re probably in the same boat as me, and want to try to fix a mistake you made by trying to do your own hair.    So bottom line, Color Oops didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t bring it back ANYWHERE close to my natural color. And I followed directions to a tee. I also used the product a week after the colorings, and one was non-permanent dye. I had high hopes for Color Oops but I&#x27;m left disappointed. I guess I&#x27;m in minority though. So if you feel your hair can&#x27;t get any worse, maybe give it a go. But if you have the money, have a professional fix your hair. I wasted $28 altogether using this product. And I&#x27;m back in square one.</li>
    <li> My hair was originally brunette and I added a hint of red to it. That did not work, so I tried Oops color remover. It turned my hair blonde... no, not a cool kind of blonde, but an ugly, faded blonde. I followed the directions and was mortified to find my hair changing colors. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I loved this the first day I got it. I had light brown hair which I died black and had redyed it quite a few times and it took out almost all of the color (there was a fade though and you could kind of tell that there were multiple layers... maybe another application would fix this?) Anyways, it was a nice, natural orangy-brown color. But then like a week later, I noticed that my hair was dark again, nearly black. It was the oddest thing I had ever experienced. Maybe this will work for people who didn&#x27;t dye their hair black or maybe I just had a weird experience, but I wouldn&#x27;t try it if your hair is black.</li>
    <li> My virgin hair had been colored one shade darker in a salon less than a week before trying this product. It lightened the color but didn&#x27;t restore my natural color. The color was still too golden/red.</li>
    <li> I have dyed my hair many, many colors over the past 15 years.  Recently I was a blonde and decided to go back to a darker color.  I figured if I used a semi-permanent color, I could avoid my hair soaking up too much of the dye.  Wrong.  My tips were dark brown and my roots were beige.  I tried to fix it with a deposit only demi-permanent, trying to get it even.  Wrong again.  Most of my hair turned black and my roots were red.  It was late and Sally&#x27;s was closed so I stopped at the Walgreen&#x27;s and bought Color Oops.  I followed the directions to the letter.  I have used color removers before with success (Colorfix), so I wasn&#x27;t nervous about the product.  When I got out of the shower, my hair was orange, blonde, and brown.  I gave up and went to bed.  When I got up the next day, things had evened out a little more and my hair was mostly a brownish red, which was very pretty.  The problem is, it keeps getting darker.  It&#x27;s been 3 days now and my hair is so dark that it&#x27;s nearly black again.  What a waste.</li>
    <li> I had dyed my dark ash blonde hair to a dark red color. After a few months I was bored and wanted to go back to blonde. Last time I went from red to blonde, it took forever!! But this time I used the extra strength color oops and it took the dark red to a copper blonde! I was scared at first because I thought it might turn fire engine red, but I am pleased with the results. I would try it if you aren&#x27;t afraid of copper hair.</li>
    <li> I am soooo amazed at this product! It worked really well. My natural hair color is a medium brown and for the last two years, I have been highlighting it so I have a dirty blonde look. For some reason I decided to dye it a reddish brown. My hair really took to the dye and it turned out to be a dark brown with a red tint. I Have pretty long thick hair so I bought 2 boxes. If you have medium length or short hair, you can get away with one box. I left it on for a total of 40 minutes and it lifted my hair almost back to the original blonde hair color that I was dying it before. Its now a really light brown, almost strawberry blonde. I would have maybe liked to have a seen a little more lift, but overall, I am very pleased with the results! I did not sustain any spotting or striping, but I did make sure to get every inch of my hair lathered in the stuff. NOTE** This stuff does smell bad! Smells like rotten eggs your kids forgot to throw away 3 months after easter. Dont be scared by the smell....Throw away all remnants of the product to minimize lingering stench...YOU WILL BE HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT! I also almost think it left my hair in better shape than before. It did NO damage to my hair at all! I really REALLY recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I am so very happy with this product! :-) I have colored my hair so many times I almost forgot what my natural color really is. It had become way too dark, very very darkbrown, almost black and I did not like it. So I got 2 packets of this Extra Strength Color Oops and I´m glad i did, I have a little more than shoulder length thick wavy hair. I used both packets and totally drenched my hair just to be sure to get even coverage. And my oh my, I got great results! No visible damage and the color is fab! I now have reddish/golden/coppertoned locks and I love them! I can absolutely reccommend this product, just make sure you have enough to cover all your hair.     Just to be on the safe side, I did do the reccommended allergy test 24 hours before AND I cut a few strands of hair off for an ,,off the head test\\&quot; to see how it would turn out. I am done with unwanted surprises on my hair! Color Oops saved me from my last coloring mistake. :-)</li>
    <li> I ran across an ad for this product in Como. As a hairdresser I just have to say \\&quot;WHY?\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been doing hair for 20 yrs. This type of remover will work for some very small jobs. But if you try to make it do something to \\&quot;big\\&quot; welcome to the orange hair club!!  My advice is see your stylist. At least he/she can point you in a better direction.</li>
    <li> This worked!  I used as directed after applying a \\&quot;professional grade\\&quot; color at home on my own (after years of going to the salon) and ended up with a disgusting MUDDY golden color on my gorgeous previously light golden blonde with honey highlights!  I panicked!  Hated it, googled hair color remover and this came up with the BEST reviews....it is a daunting task to do the rinsing and washing for the whole 20 minutes but if you persevere the results are well worth the wait....my hair is much drier, but nothing a few conditioning treatments and a trim won&#x27;t cure.  Just follow the directions and you will def be happy!  NO JOKE!  5 stars from me!!</li>
    <li> I had bought a chocolate brown color much like my natural color to try to cover up my blonde highlights. It covered up the highlights beautifully but it was more of a purpley,reddish brown, not a brown brown and I didnt like the look. I tried to re-dye it a couple of days later (bad, i know!) with a light brown color. No change whatsoever. Really fed up with the not so natural color, i tried again yesterday with a professional grade hair dye, to go light brown. It ended up darker. I searched the internet and of all hair color removers, this had the most positive reviews. It smells bad, but its not unbearable or as extreme as some may say. The rinsing is a pain but it got me to the light brown I wanted in the first place! I have no intentions of re-dying. I gave it a 4 because it dried my hair out but I did a 30 minute hot olive oil treatment and my hair is pretty close to where it was before. Will probably go to Sallys tomorrow for a good deep conditioner and repairing treatment and then leave it alone for a while. Love this product!</li>
    <li> My natural haircolor is dark brown. I have had blond hair with highlights for the past 5 years. 4 months ago, I decided let my natural dark brown haircolor grow out but I added blond highlights. After the highlights started to show the roots and since fall was approaching, I decided to dye the highlights brown. I was given a level 3n permanent color since 4n had been too light when I had used it once before. Well, hello Elvira! It looked black. Neighbors commented and said \\&quot;Oh, it will grow out.\\&quot; I went to CVS to buy OOPS and the clerk at the register and 4 other women said, \\&quot;It looks good you don&#x27;t need to do anything. \\&quot; After 2 days as Elvira, I couldn&#x27;t take it any longer.  I went back to CVS and lo and behold, the same clerk was there. I told her I wanted to try it. I bought 2 OOPS extra strenth, since my hair is medium length and moderately thick. I also bought Garnier bamboo 10 minute light brown semi perm haircolor. OOPS pulled all of the black out and left me with a light auburn where the blond highlights were and my natural color underneath. No more Elvira! I washed it twice then I waited until my hair was almost dry then put on the light brown Garnier. I left it on for 5 of the 10 minutes. It came out a nice medium to dark brown and looks natural for me. (If you want light brown, you should probably go with the dark blond). Your hair is porous and will absorb the color quickly. The conditioner in the Garnier made my hair soft and it looks great. I only used 1 box of OOPS. The smell was not as bad as everyone said. It did smell like sulfur, but the results are worth it. Get the OOPS! It is great!</li>
    <li> I was contemplating whether I should put 4 or 5 stars and I finally decided on 5. I had to do two of the color oops boxes which...yeah it fried my hair a bit...still a little dry feeling but I put some protein filler on with a deep conditioner and left it on for about 25 minutes and it helped a ton. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 8 or 9 and have never let it grow out so I have no clue what my natural color is...Color Oops didn&#x27;t get me back to my natural color but I didn&#x27;t expect that...in fact I expected nothing. I had dyed my hair black once or twice about 8 or 9 months ago. I went to a salon and they put some kind of stripper on my hair (maybe a color remover?) but it didn&#x27;t really do much besides take the blue out of the black (which did help). Last time I dyed my hair black it took 6 hours of their strongest bleach (and about $160) just to get me to dark dark brown so I was willing to try anything before resorting to such drastic measures again. Well it worked. I was shocked. I&#x27;m a few shades down from black and I have no clue how it worked. Now it did turn some of my regrowth kind of orange and that&#x27;s because I&#x27;d been putting brown dye on all of my hair but I guess my ends never soaked it up. I can correct that with a bit of dye I picked up but still wow! Try it.  I probably didn&#x27;t need the second box but I thought it would help take out some of the orange...it didn&#x27;t really but oh well.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say I read these reviews and wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would turn up. I originally haven dark brown hair but I have been dying it since I am 14. I never bleached it thought. I have been dying it red for the past months with Nice and easy semi-permanent colour. Somehow it never faded away and I wanted the red out of my hair for the summer. I used this product and it worked: removed all the red out of my hair. Now my hair is a light-medium brown. I might keep it this colour or wait a week or so to dye it again. The product doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers but it isn&#x27;t that bad at all. I left the product in my hair a bit longer just to make sure the red would be out. I also used Head and Shoulders shampoo while rinsing for 20 minutes. I am happy with the results and hope this review helped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an at home hair dyer for years. For about 2 years I stopped the dyeing, then got really bored. I then dyed my hair black, and it was okay for a few months, but I just got bored again, plus my roots look awful. Instead of bleaching it all out I decided to buy this at Walmart. My hair is very long (to my lower back) not necessarily thin, but fine. One package covered my entire head, and then some. However, this smells really.....really bad. Like sewage and sulfur. I had to wash my hair several times to get rid of the smell from my hair.  When my husband came home from work the next morning he thought sewage was coming up from the pipes and freaked out. BUT my hair is a natural brown shade. Not streaky at all. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it considering the smell.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair jet black a few months ago, and it obviously had started growing out and not looking the best.  My hair had been a reddish light brown from a previous dye and the many before that.  I did not want to continue the black color and figured I was stuck until I read about this stuff.  AMAZING!  I used it and rinsed for the 20 minutes, maybe longer, and wallah!!  It is not even completely dry yet and I LOVE it!  It is closer to my natural color than it has been in a LONG time :)  It looks like a dark blond with reddish tones....from JET BLACK.  Everyone said it couldn&#x27;t be done unless I spent hundreds at the salon...I proved them wrong!  I did it in my very small bathroom with no ventilation and personally did not think the fumes or smell was bad at all.  Seriously. The smells from the dyes I use were 50x worse.  And my hair is pretty tough, so this may not be the case for everyone, but so far no damage can be seen or felt.  I would and already have reccomended this product to anyone who needs a redo!!!!! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I tried this after trying a new brand of hair color that left my hair gothic black instead of medium brown. It did the job lightening the color to where I wanted it. That said, it did dry out my hair somewhat and made the texture a little rougher. I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair was anywhere near being fried, but it did cause a little damage.</li>
    <li> I went to Aveda and paid 150$ for them to dye my hair from blond to brown. They completely butchered it and I ended up with almost black hair. I&#x27;m the maid of honor in my best friend&#x27;s wedding next week, so I was upset when Aveda basically told me I had no options. I did some research and found Oops. I was freaked out about trying it because if it didn&#x27;t work, I was going to look stranger than I already did. I did a strand test and the color looked okay, so I applied it to my whole head. It developed very fast. In four minutes it had lightened to about the shade I wanted, so I ran and jumped in the shower and washed it out. It looks so much better. I&#x27;m really grateful that this product exists.</li>
    <li> BACKGROUND&lt;br /&gt;As a naturally medium blonde 20-something, I&#x27;d been talked into going red by my salon stylist. I loved it, but 8 months down the road I was frustrated with having to touch it up every few weeks, let alone not being able to consistently find the right shade in the drug store (sorry, but I&#x27;m not paying a stylist obscene amounts of cash to do my hair every few weeks). I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to color and didn&#x27;t realize how difficult it would be to try to take my hair back to blonde after having it red for many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my stylist, who said that she could strip it, which would be time-consuming, damaging and expensive. The other option was to highlight my hair repeatedly over the course of a year or so while my natural hair grew back in (again, expensive). I thought, surely there has to be some other way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PREPARATION FOR COLOR OOPS&lt;br /&gt;Then I found Color Oops online. I read hundreds of reviews on multiple Web sites, some good and some frightening, and picked up lots of usage tips along the way. I proceeded to purchase two boxes of Color Oops, two boxes of hair color (Nice n Easy - Natural Dark Neutral Blonde and Natural Lightest Golden Brown) in case I had an \\&quot;omg\\&quot; moment, a shower cap, a wide-toothed comb and a thermal conditioning treatment (heavy duty conditioner). If you use Color Oops, I highly recommend making sure you have all these items handy. Also, read the box insert, and know it like the back of your hand. This is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to do a strand test. Cut out a small piece of your hair and just do it, or you&#x27;ll be sorry later. Check it every five minutes so you can see the various shades of change and decide on the best time for your hair. They recommend no longer than 20 minutes. Based on mine, I saw my hair change from red to blonde after 20 minutes and elected to leave it on for the full amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROCESS&lt;br /&gt;Still, I was super nervous as I prepared the mixture and dumped it on my hair. It is a thin mixture, maybe a bit thicker than water but not by much, so be careful with the dribbles. I didn&#x27;t notice any bleaching effect on the red robe I was wearing. As everyone else has said, it has a very strong odor - citrus and sulfur, so be prepared. I made sure to spread the mixture quickly and evenly, using the wide-toothed comb to ensure that my hair was fully saturated, then put the shower cap on to help \\&quot;lock\\&quot; in the product. I avoided being in cool areas of my house, as the insert said this could cause it not to process correctly (also a good reason to use the shower cap). I&#x27;d recommend checking your hair periodically, even after the strand test, so you don&#x27;t let it go too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing it out was a breeze in the shower. This is the most important part of the process. I kept the water warm, rinsed for several minutes, shampooed and rinsed for several minutes, and repeated once more. Rinse until your water gets cold, no joke! Your hair may feel a little stiff at this point, so use your restoring conditioner after the second shampoo. I had some left over from an older Nice n Easy kit and it worked better than the thermal treatment I bought specifically for this purpose (read on to find out why I ended up having to condition twice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MOMENT OF TRUTH&lt;br /&gt;After I got out of the shower I could tell right away that my hair was looking pretty bleached blonde and much lighter than my natural color, but probably due to the previous dyeing I&#x27;d done (most over-the-counter permanent dyes include a bleaching agent, no matter what color you choose). I dried it using my blow dryer and it came out looking pale and brassy - almost a strawberry blonde. My boyfriend said, \\&quot;Your hair is kind of orange...\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t think it was hideous, but not exactly what I had envisioned. It didn&#x27;t seem damaged, either, though I had very healthy hair to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REDYEING AFTER COLOR OOPS&lt;br /&gt;So I started thinking about that boxof blonde hair color I bought to use after the Color Oops, in case it didn&#x27;t turn out. Color Oops recommends using a color filler if you choose to dye right after the color removal process. They also advise that you choose a lighter, warmer shade than that of what you are trying to achieve and say not to let it process for more than several minutes. I skipped the color filler and applied just the color, noticing that by the time I&#x27;d applied it to my whole head, it had already \\&quot;taken\\&quot; and rushed to rinse it out, but it was too late. After no more than just a few minutes, the blonde hair color had turned my hair a distinct brown, and on the ashy side (even though it was labeled a \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; shade). That wasn&#x27;t the hair color&#x27;s fault, though - it was mine. The box insert is not joking. Use a color filler and/or buy at least a couple shades warmer and lighter than your desired end result if you are dyeing right after Color Oops. So if you&#x27;re looking to go medium/dark blonde, buy a golden light blonde (or even lightest blonde).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR OOPS... TAKE TWO!&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I had bought the second box of Color Oops, did another strand test, and decided to leave it in for only 15 minutes this time. I got the same result as the first Oops application (glowing blonde hair), and still little, if any, damage. Stinky, though. I don&#x27;t notice the smell one day after, if that&#x27;s any consolation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE AFTER GLOW&lt;br /&gt;Realize that the rinsing process is absolutely the most important part of making Color Oops work (yes, I&#x27;m reiterating, but honestly it can&#x27;t be repeated enough). Even after what I thought was excessive rinsing, I did notice that my color darkened overnight, meaning that the first application probably would have done the same thing if I&#x27;d been patient. I am still blonde, but not back to my natural caramel blonde. It appears very golden with some glowing reddish tones, which could be from the previous dyeing, but definitely toned down after just 8 hours. I have actually received compliments today on the new color, and told people that I had my hair stripped at the salon. They commented that it didn&#x27;t appear damaged at all. The results are that good. Just be aware that you will likely have some darkening up to 24 hours after you complete the process (and also take this into account if you are redyeing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE END?&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this was so long. I learned quite a bit about Color Oops by reading reviews and realize that this information is invaluable to other people who are thinking about taking the risk to get their hair back to normal (or at least close to it).

    <li> I have natural golden blonde hair and i&#x27;ve been dying it for years. My husband talked me into dying it dark red and i quickly grew tired of it because the up keep was just to much with my blonde roots growing in. I tried everything to get the dye to fade, its been over a month since i last dyed it and it faded to a medium redish brown. I wanted to get it to my natural medium/dark golden blonde without stripping my hair or paying an expensive salon. I bought color oops hearing that it doesnt damage your hair and takes the colour off..   After half hour of standing in the shower rinsing my hair ( painfully boring- recommend music! ) i saw that it did fade my hair about 2 levels but now i am left with a bright light orange colour.. not pretty!!! It did damage my hair a bit, feels extremely dry ( this could also be because of the 2 shampoos and 30 mintues of water ) but i think with a couple weeks of deep conditioning it will really help.   I wish it lighted it a little more,  especially since i am still left with a bright orange which i have no idea how to cover without going back darker.. But i think if you start with a brown it will work wonders for you.. As for if your starting out with redish hair like i did.. make sure you ahve a back up plan because this orange hair is not a great look.</li>
    <li> This remover is amazing it smells kind of fruity when you put it on but then has a sulfer kind of smell after my hair is very fine and I only had to wash and rinse my hair twice I had sapphire black hair and it took it right out if you made a mistake buy this product you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!!! Worked awesome on my hair and I dye it TONS!! And it still pulled all the color out! Fantastic!!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all, my hair was the same exact extra dark brown it was before I used the product. Some color did rinse out but I did not see a difference when my hair dried. I had similar amounts of hair dye wash out just using Suave clarifying shampoo and conditioner. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> To start, my hair is naturally brunette. One day i decided to dye it black, biggest mistake ive ever made. After a few months of it being black i was so sick of it that my mom and i decided to try to use color oops and wash some of it out. Well after using it on the first day, it worked but also turned my hair kind of auburn. The next day after showering again, the horible smell was still in my hair and my hair turned out to be going back to dark brown almost black. Three days after my hair is almost back to the black but dark brown, not auburn or brunette anymore. Its almost like it was a temporary wash...</li>
    <li> I used this on my dark purple hair. It stripped the color pretty good, and now its a pastelly purple. It also made my hair feel pretty soft afterwards, which I wasnt expecting.One more application and it should be to how I want it. The major downside is the smell. Its not unbearable, but even after you wash it out, its still there. And the smell comes back every time you get your hair wet. This lasted for a few days. If you really want your color out of your hair, and dont mind the sulfery smell then this product is perfect.</li>
    <li> this product is awsome!!! okay first of all, i had blonde hair and dyed it red. it was hard to keep and i wanted it back blonde.this product smells like rotten eggs but its worth it!! it turned my hair from red to strawberrry blonde! i was so happy!!</li>
    <li> I have light brown hair with blonde and red highlights naturally. About mmm four or three years ago I started dying it dark brown to black. About a year ago I cut all my long hair off and I want to grow it back without the harmfullness of dying it every month so I wanted my natural hair color back. When I looked up the stripping process the sites I looked at said it would take a lot of time and a lot of money. I work part time at a gas station I don&#x27;t have a lot of money. While I was at one website somebody mentioned this product, I read reveiws and it seemed wonderful. I spent 15 dollars on it when a month later I saw it at Walmart for 10 but anyway. I cut my bangs before I did my whole head to do a strand test... It worked wonders on my strand test but later that day I did it on my whole head. Yes it does smell like rotten eggs. It didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING on my whole head. I do think that it made my hair grow a little faster though. After a month of me leaving my hair alone THEN people starting asking me constantly if I lightened my hair. (I had an 1 inch of roots when I used the product, a month after I had about 2 inches of roots.) And my hairs always grown at the average rate.  After this failed attempt I bought bleach and hair dye to somewhat match my natural hair color and I love it.</li>
    <li> I used it once before to remove red dye over platinum blonde and it worked great. A year later I try to do the same, but this time it is brown dye over platinum. Almost no results. I have crappy brown and orange hair not a peak of blonde is showing after 2 uses of 2 boxes of product each. I did everything just as it says it on the box.</li>
    <li> When I first used this to take the black dye out of my hair, I was so pleased with the result. It took it almost completely out. The next day I woke up and the color was still great, a nice warm brown. Then i shampooed and conditioned with Ion conditioner. To my horror, half the black re-appeared after conditioning and now I have hair that reeks of rotten eggs AND doesn&#x27;t look much different from when I started. I guess something in the (completely plain, normal!!) conditioner caused the dye molecules to get large again and so the black is back. Very confused and disappointed.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair black and before I had virgin dark brown hair. I guess I wanted a change. Wrong! I regretted it...  And I wanted at least my natural hair color back. So I did some research and took a risk and ordered it. I followed the instructions washed literally for 20 mins. And my hair is back its natural color. A little lighter but the black is gone!!!!!</li>
    <li> Decided to try this based on reviews and you tube video testimonials.  I&#x27;ve been dying my hair a dark auburn for a few years.  Tried color oops the other night and while it lightened, there was still a lot of red in my hair.  I bought two boxes so the next night I did the process again following the directions and rinsing for a long long time and it lightened it more but there&#x27;s still red in it.  I don&#x27;t want to try for a third application because I think it will damage my hair too much.  The product does smell like rotten eggs but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and didn&#x27;t linger more than a day.  I think this product probably works better on freshly colored hair or if you don&#x27;t have two many layers of color.  If you do try it, make sure to use a really good deep conditioner so your hair doesn&#x27;t dry out and look damaged.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been highlighing my hair since 11th grade and I&#x27;m not really sure what color it is at this point, light brown probably...Anyways, with the economy the way it is, starting to resent the $100 every 6-8 weeks for a professional salon, I decided a few weeks ago to go slightly brown-ish (Loreal Light Ash Brown).  It came out beautiful, but within 2 weeks it had washed out and I was Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Blonde again.  So day befofe yesterday, I figured I would use Medium Ash Brown instead.  Big Mistake.  I looked like Elvira, totally black.  I googled it and many people said use Prell or even Dawn dishwashing liquid.  Didn&#x27;t make a dent in Elvira&#x27;s black head.  Went back to the CVS and bought Oops, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  If you&#x27;re used to doing your own color, it comes out a lot quicker (not as gel like) as regular hair color, but it doesn&#x27;t drip. I followed the directions to a T, keeping it on the full 20 minutes.  Then set my timer and jumped in the shower for my 20 minute rinse session.  That&#x27;s the hardest part.  Someone before said they almost fainted, and I understand.  Even with me turning it to warm, standing under the shower head for 20 minutes gets HOT! But I didn&#x27;t want to ever see Elvira again, so I rinsed and rinsed.  Put conditioner on for five minutes at the end, and when I blow dried my hair is back to the pretty light ash brown from 2 weeks ago.    So very happy with the fix I can&#x27;t stand it! Just stand in front of a fan when you&#x27;re done and drink ice water! I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 60 year old male with mostly grey hair.  I decided to dye my hair and mustache light ash brown. What a disaster. It turned out deep dark brown. My mustache looked like a Groucho Marx grease stick paint-on. Shocking!  My wife&#x27;s hair stylist said the only solution was to wash my hair three times a day with an astringent shampoo like VO5 until it lightened.  I learned about Color Oops on Amazon and rushed to Walgreens wearing a baseball cap.    I followed the directions exactly and am delighted. My hair looks the way I wanted it to be. Not all the brown is gone but a second application would do the trick.  I like it just the way it is now.    If you have long, thick hair maybe you should buy two just in case.  This is a great product. It is not stinky like some have said or maybe I just didn&#x27;t care.  Anyway, you can&#x27;t go wrong giving this a try.</li>
    <li> Clairol has caused a certain amount of aggravation for me when they decided to discontinue their Clairol Herbal Essences #44 Paint The Town Red(Intense Ruby Red) Hair Color. I had been using this shade ever since Clairol had it out on the market. When they discontinued it, I bought boxes &amp; box on clearance at a variety of retailers. When I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, I started purchasing it online. And then it was nearly impossible to find anyone who carries it. And the few places that do carry it, their prices are almost as much as having one&#x27;s hair colored at a salon.  Next I tried Clairol Hydrience #34 Tropic Burgundy. It turned my hair extremely dark. I hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending quite a bit online researching the best way to remove this awful hair color and not wanting to spend a small fortune having it done professionally, I finally used Clairol Extra Strength Color Oops for the firs time today. I stopped about 5 minutes before the 20 minutes were up. On the plus side, when I first opened up the bottles before I mixed them together, there was a pleasant, fruity scent. But once I mixed both bottles together, there was a horrible rotten egg smell. Even after I had shampooed &amp; conditioned my hair, there was still that awful rotten egg smell in my hair.  My natural hair color was a light to medium brown. The Color Oops not only removed the current hair color I had used but it also removed all of the original hair color I had also used. Color Oops turned my hair to an almost light golden brown. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. It didn&#x27;t even look like me. There was no way I was going to be seen with my hair like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About an hour after I used the Color Oops, I re-colored my hair with Garnier Ultra Nutrisse R3 Light Intense Auburn &amp; much to my surprise and delight, my hair is now the exact shade it was when I used the Herbal Essences Intense Ruby Red Hair Color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clairol Color Oops if worth using to get rid of the old hair color but you&#x27;re taking a chance on what color your hair is going to be returned to.

    <li> Product smells terrible and removed only a few shades of black. I dyed my brown hair permanent black but product left a brassy dark brown color. Use this if you colored within a few shades of your natural color.</li>
    <li> I have naturally light red hair that I have been dyeing black for about three years now. Everyone (including professionals) told me it would be impossible to come back from black without serious damage to my hair. I did a lot of internet research and decided to take my chances on color oops. Yes, it stinks, but it&#x27;s not unbearable, and I didnt notice the smell lingering in my hair afterwards. I did the strand test first--very important--to make sure your hair isnt gonna melt or something tragic. I was happy with the strand test and went full steam ahead on my whole head. It is thinner than hair dye-so be careful for running down your face. One bottle was sufficient enough to thoroughly wet my shoulder length hair. I let it process for the full twenty minutes with the cap on. I followed the instructions about repeated shampooing and rinsing. When I was finished, my hair did not feel damaged at all, maybe even a little softer than before the process. When it was dry, I was back to my natural red, even having nautral highlights and lowlights. It took every speck of the jet jet black color that I had been using for three years right out of my hair. I highly recommend this product, but I also highly recommend the strand test for many reasons. First, you need to know how long to process it for the result you desire. Second, no woman wants to fry or melt her hair. Third, some dyes have metallic salts in them and unless you are sure that what you are dyeing your hair with does not......you could seriously damage your hair with the remover. Good Luck everyone----I love this stuff</li>
    <li> i was so hoping this would work for my henna dyed hair but it did absolutely nothing but show my roots more. but did make my hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> Despite it smelling awful (like rotten eggs) it stripped all the black out of my hair and left a really nice brown/red shade behind. My hair isn&#x27;t damaged at all, either.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  Just FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. It really works. I went from looking like Morticia from the Addams family to my normal self in one hour.  The smell is not that bad. I have used this product many times to correct my crazy &amp;#34; lets see what I can do &amp;#34; to change my hair&lt;br /&gt;color.  I recommend to really condition your hair Before and After you use this product.  Also if you are going to re-color your hair use a protein filler&lt;br /&gt;to keep your hair from absorbing too much color.  You can find this on Amazon also.</li>
    <li> funny story:  went to get a hair cut Friday, my stylist mentions my hair being so light and maybe do I want to darken it up a bit.  Why not??  So off he goes to the hair color mixing land.  He comes back a few minutes later and says, what about a hint of red?  SURE!!! I say sounds great!!  3 hours later my hair is red.  RED.  RED not found in nature red.  but the color job was free :)  Today Sunday after 2.5 days of disgust every time I look in the mirror I realized I had to fix this.  This red.  This horrible orangy red red.  It&#x27;s like ronald mcdonalds wig and a hunting vest had a baby on my head.  Makes my skin look blotchy, really brings out my crows feet, my blue eyes look alien. HELP!!  Found these reviews on Amazon, headed down to my local drugstore (scarf on head) and 1 hour later... VIOLA!!  Back to blonde.  Yes it&#x27;s a bit brassy (really not too bad) but I feel like myself again.  I would kiss the maker of this product if they stopped by...</li>
    <li> I have a lot of thick hair that&#x27;s cut into a chin-length bob and I had been coloring it soft black for over 6 months to hide my grays and also blend in a bad color job that left sections of my hair a strange red color.  The soft black had been doing a great job but I just turned 43 and it&#x27;s summertime and I felt like it was too harsh for my age and time of the year so I read a lot of reviews and watched a lot of videos on YouTube and decided that for the price, Color Oops was the one I was going to try.    My hairdresser was afraid to use anything on my hair to take the black out and she suggested lightening it through session after session of weaving. I was never convinced that I was going to be satisfied with those results and I can truthfully say that for $12, I am happier with my results.    Let me just say that I have really strong hair that can take a real BEATING but that my scalp is on the sensitive side.  I did not do the sensitivity test or color test either....which I probably should have done but I was eager to get the black out.    I left the product on for 30 minutes instead of the recommended 20 BECAUSE my hair is strong and in good condition.  If your hair is not like mine, you probably should not leave it on that long.  I put the heat cap on and went out to my back yard in the sun because the directions say not to be anywhere in the cold or where cold air can hit your head.  The secret is in the heat while it&#x27;s processing AND in the amount of time you spend rinsing it out of your hair.      I came in and took a shower letting the water hit my head 30 minutes making sure it was all out and also shampooed with a dandruff shampoo one time and frizz control shampoo the second time.  I was hot and tired from the hot water by the time it was all done, but I&#x27;m happy I took that long rinsing because the results were totally worth it.  I also used deep conditioner that I had saved from a previous hair coloring to apply right after and also sat with my hair in a different heat cap for 20 minutes.  My hair was not damaged or dried out or fried in the least.    The black is completely gone from my hair.  It&#x27;s now a darkish brown with pleasant shades of red throughout.  I&#x27;ve never lightened my hair anytime so there are no traces of bleaching/lightening that other people might find with their hair.  The product takes all of the dark pigments out of your hair that have been deposited by coloring your hair.  It does not take any bleaching/lightening pigments out of your hair because that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed to do.    The directions say you can color your hair the same day, but if you don&#x27;t seal your hair with a conditioner after using Oops, then your hair is going to be VERY VERY porous and will grab the hair color like a sponge.  If you have to color your hair again immediately, be sure to use the deep conditioner FIRST so your hair will not soak up the color as much.  If you can wait several days in between using this product and coloring your hair, that&#x27;s even better because your hair will become less porous over time.  Also, be certain that you choose a hair color that is LIGHTER than the shade you are trying to become.  Everyone who has used this and the company all say that if you use a dark shade to color your hair that you&#x27;re going to be back in the same boat that brought you here in the first place.  So IF you must recolor, go lighter.    The only down-side to Color Oops is that it does smell like sulfur or rotten eggs to some extent because of the chemicals used.  But there is NO bleach or ammonia!  If you can open a window wherever you&#x27;re applying the product, do so and be sure you have a garbage sack to throw the bottles and heat cap away after you&#x27;re finished and that will help air your house out faster.  Also, if you have a strongly scented conditioner or leave-in treatment to put on your hair afterward, that will also help get the smell out of your own hair.  It&#x27;s really NOT that bad.  I asked 3 differentpeople to smell my hair after I was all done and none of them told me that I stunk.  I promise, it&#x27;s all okay!    Just follow the package directions and read as many other reviews and tips that you can.  It will remove the dark pigments from hair coloring just like it says.  And if it can work on my hair, it can certainly work on yours.</li>
    <li> Ok, so my hair is naturally medium to dark blonde, I do highlights twice a year with two different warm blonde colors. When I went to get my hair highlighted this time, it came out too brassy yellow. I asked my stylist to tone it down and she used a toner with ash blonde color blended into it, which is where everything went bad.  The ash color turned my warm tones almost whiteish gray, I about cried.  So my stylist said ok lets redo the weave and she weaved me back with warm blonde and dark blonde, which totally turned out yellow and really dark on top of the ash, it was just so bad.  SO, next my stylist says lets highlight it using bleach to lift the color, why I let her do this I dont know other than I was desperate.  I have been going to her for about 5 years now, never had any issues, hair always looked great. SO, after the highlights, I still had the yellow streaks, the dark streaks and the ashy tint but the highlights did even it out a little, still just overall not a good color result.  My poor hair! At that point, I just left, my stylist said to call her in a couple of days, we&#x27;d figure something out, seriously? Ok, so I went to the store and just randomly found Color Oops Extra Strength.  I did the strand test and it took out the ash tint so I was good to go. I followed the instructions and now here I am with no ash tint, no streaks of dark, just golden blonde, still a little too gold/too light but honestly much better. My hair doesnt feel damaged or anything! The rinsing for 20 minutes then another 5 really wears your hair out but I think its super important to do what the instructions say. It does smell kinda funky but not too bad.  I hope my result darkens a little over 24 hours, I just did it last night. I would say Color Oops is worth the cost and helped me out of my hair disaster.</li>
    <li> Color Oops WILL remove too much or unwanted hair color. If your hair was colored before the latest \\&quot;oops\\&quot;, it will also remove that color, leaving you most likely with yellow-y, orange-y, and somewhat uneven hair that in most cases will require additional coloring to be transformed into something pretty;-) At this point you have two choices:  1) Immediately (possibly wearing a hat?) go to a professional salon, explain what happened, and let THEM do the job with demi-permanent color of your choice. I recommend to ask the stylist to treat your hair with a protein filler before coloring it, or better yet, do it at home right after \\&quot;color oops\\&quot;. This is a foolproof way of getting preferred hair color and saves you quite some money, since this isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;correction\\&quot; anymore, but a single process dye job.  2) At home - If you are coloring your hair yourself, you HAVE to have a \\&quot;Neutral Protein Filler\\&quot; (sally&#x27;s, amazon). Use it as a leave-in conditioner BEFORE a hair dye job. The filler will restore the structure of your hair, so subsequently applied color will grab on evenly. The treatment also helps covering grey, avoid the \\&quot;hot root\\&quot; effect, and overly processed ends. I apply this treatment even before professional dye treatments. I am really, really pleased with the results! Less damage, better color, no oversaturation. For those going brunette: Use a NEUTRAL shade (to avoid too much red) of a medium/dark blond or light brown demi-permanent hair color or hair gloss. Put protein treatment in your hair, wait 20 min., don&#x27;t rinse!!! TIP for those fearing too much red - buy the \\&quot;UNRED\\&quot; drops (Ricky&#x27;s, Sally&#x27;s, Amazon). Add a few drops (following the instructions) to the color mix, this will take care of the unwanted red. After putting the color mix on your roots, massage it through the rest of your hair, let it sit for 5-10 min. max! This should be enough time for the color to grab. Rinse, wash, rinse, deeply condition, style. Voilà, your new color!  Other tip based on experience:  If your hair turned very light and you want to go to a deeper brown shade, you want to use a double process. First you color with a light strawberry blonde/light golden blonde, after that you color with a neutral shade of medium/dark blonde/light brunette. This will give your hair a nice dimension and add gloss. You probably will still end up on a \\&quot;warmer\\&quot; side.</li>
    <li> YES!!! This product is amazing. I change my hair like I change clothes. I&#x27;ve also been growing it out for over two years, so now that it&#x27;s finally long, I have to be really careful about what I do to it, since I only have about 4 inches of healthy hair at the top (haha). From there down, the rest of the hair has been through a lot! Bleaching, black dye, bleach again, harsh hair color removers, reds, and the latest, a cherry/burgundy color. As you can imagine, the red started washing out from the over processed  sections of hair immediately,  leaving the healthy top a glowing cherry, and the bottom a dull, faded mess.   I was about to just go get a haircut and try to bleach it all out and start over when I read about Color Oops. What really got my attention was the claim that it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair. I figured it HAD to be better than bleach, so I bought three bottles. I ended up only needing two, and saturated my hair from top to bottom. I covered it with the provided plastic caps and tied an additional plastic bag on my hair. I waited 20 minutes and *followed the instructions* on rinsing (as well as for the application and development processes).   When I was done, my hair was completely back to normal. No damage. It even got rid of some lingering blackish low-lights I had from a year ago. It&#x27;s a tad lighter on top than my natural color, but that may be due to the fact that it&#x27;s healthier there... the rest of my hair was dyed (lightened from black with bleach... making it orange and then dyed with a brown and auburn mix to achieve my natural reddish-brown orange) so it only removed the cherry, leaving the natural look. So very happy with this!  I put two photos on... with sunglasses is the only picture I have with the cherry red so it&#x27;s kinda hard to see, and the other is my natural.</li>
    <li> I have bleached and highlighted my hair for years. Last year I decided to grow out my natural dirty blonde color. When my roots got about 3 inches long they looked so bad with my bleached ends that I decided to put a semi permanent deposit only color. The first few times it was great: a nice light brown color. And it always faded out, especially when i did a lot of swimming. This last time I decided to go a shade darker. . . well after 2 months of washing it was still dark brown! Rather than applying bleach to my whole head and ruining all my \\&quot;growing out\\&quot; progress, I decided to give color oops a try.  I got good results. My roots returned to my natural color, a golden dark blonde. My ends (where the color was over the bleached hair) also turned a similar dark blonde color. I was kind of hoping it would wash more color out on the ends so they would be blonder. But overall, I think i got a good result.  My final review:  ***Great results removing semi permanent color from virgin hair.  ***Moderate lift of semi permanent color from pre-bleached hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a local walgreens as I couldnt wait two days for shipping. I am trying to remove purple semi permanent dye and it did absolutely nothing. I can&#x27;t speak for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; colors, but it definitely does not work on purple semi permanent. good luck.</li>
    <li> I let my friend talk me into dying my light blonde hair an awful dark brown with a purple tint. My hair was plum and I was devastated. I have long, thick, healthy hair and didn&#x27;t want to bleach it right away. My sister dyed her hair black once and bleached it and it came out in clumps in her hand! So the same friend, who originally dyed it the plum color, recommended the Color Oops. I liked the idea that it had no ammonia and no bleach so I picked up two boxes of it.   After I stepped out of the shower, I almost cried because I was so relieved the color was gone! My hair turned a nice strawberry blonde. A couple of days later, we dyed it with a really light blonde because the reviews said pick up a light shade since it will turn darker. The color resulted in a really pretty light brown, which is what I originally had wanted.   Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I can not believe how well this stuff works!!!!!!! I have been using it for years, I have medium brown hair with red tints as my natural color, and have always died it a darker ash.  When I go too dark I use color oops and recolor.  I never read the instructions!  After you color oops sits on your head for the 20-25 minutes your hair, if it is like mine, is this ugly yellow orange, i rinse and recolor, never having read in the directions that you have to shampoo and then rinse for 20-30 minutes and re-shampoo and re-rinse.  It never occurred to me, because normally the last thing you would think is, don&#x27;t wash with color!  So I read the directions this time (after having used this product for years) and did exactly what it said, I couldn&#x27;t believe it, as I let my hair stand under the water it was getting browner and browner!  I must have colored my hair 6, 7 times and and used color oops each time, I never expect to happen, what happened!  My hair is its natural color!  I haven&#x27;t seen this since I was a teenager!  It is the exact same color as my brothers, the color I had when I was younger, so I knew it worked perfectly!  This is after all those coloring, all those times of using this product incorrectly!  I had to write this review because I am just amazed!  The people who came up with this should get the friggen Nobel Prize in chemistry!  I wish I would have taken photos to share, but again, I had been using this forever, and I just thought it worked really well for lighting your hair enough to put another color on top of it, and the only people who got their natural color back were blondes, I didn&#x27;t think this was possible for me!  Trust me, do it right, and you will be SO HAPPY!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I knew I wanted to go a few shades lighter... from dark brown to medium brown. So I thought I&#x27;d save my stylist some trouble and use this the night before my appointment. I followed the directions exactly. It did pull out the color, leaving the dyed parts a sort of coppery color (think of a penny). So, the next day, we dyed my hair a medium ash brown. The ends came out meh... still sort of coppery and a bit odd looking, but my roots turned almost bright orange (she called them hot roots). So then she had to dye the roots darker. And then she had to put in really fine highlights to try to blend it a little better and make it look less odd. In the end, she got my hair to look good, all things considered. But I couldn&#x27;t have fixed it without the help of a professional. And I have a feeling that if I&#x27;d let her remove the color, I&#x27;d have had much better results. When all was said and done, it took me five hours in a salon to fix this when it probably would&#x27;ve taken just a few hours if I&#x27;d not used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I can&#x27;t write this review and not mention the smell. It is hideous... like rotten eggs, or as another reviewer stated, &amp;#34;lemon fart&amp;#34;...  with a lot of emphasis on the fart side. It&#x27;s two days later now and I had to throw away the towel I used and am now in the process of bleaching my bathroom to rid the smell. And I have scented candles lit everywhere. I&#x27;m not over-reacting here... I&#x27;ve dyed my hair at homes plenty of times, and believe me when I say this is NOT the same smell as hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I kind of really want to give this two stars, but it does sort of do what it says it will, so that&#x27;s why it gets three. But will I ever touch this product again? NO. Would I recommend it to friends? NO.  Save yourself the trouble and save your nose the horror of smelling this stuff, and head to a salon.</li>
    <li> All this product did was make my hair, bathroom, entire apartment smell awful. I&#x27;ve shampooed 4+ times since applying this WORTHLESS product and I still smell like chemicals. It should say right on the box that won&#x27;t work for everyone. Black dye is especially resistant to stuff like this but this didn&#x27;t even make a dent, didn&#x27;t even lighten it. If you&#x27;ve dyed your hair black and don&#x27;t like it, tough. Shave your head or let it grow out but don&#x27;t buy Color Oops, it won&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried Color Oops was more than a year ago when I was tired of having black hair. My natural color is a medium brown but I have been dying my hair black for about 5 years. I get bored with my hair soemtimes and so I got bored with black. I read about Color Oops online and I decided to give it a try since the Walgreens close to me carried it. I was very skeptical, becasue I knew nothing would take black (BLACK) out except bleach, and I did not want to fry my hair anymore. I tried a bottle and followed the directions with about 30 minutes in the shower for rinsing. Yes, it smells horrible but I survived. When I was rinsing my hair I could actually see the discolored water go down the drain. I was really surprised becasue the black hair color seemed like it would stay with me forever. Once I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror, my hair was actually lighter. It had a darker reddish tint to it and my roots were about 2 shades brighter than the rest of the hair. I was so happy! I repeated the process a week later and another week later and was finally happy with the results. The red tint goes away and your hair color will eventually return to a natural looking color, but rinsing is the key! Ever since then I had my natural hair color back! However I do like to experiment with hair color and since i knew Color Oops worked I dyed my hair dark brown to light brown to currently red. If I do not like the result, I just use Color Oops and the color comes right out. Currently I want to try going red, but it is quite hard to fid a bright red color that will not show up really dark on my hair after the Color Oops. Overall, it is a lifesaver and the damage to hair is very minimal. One thing I would highly suggest to anyone useing this product is to apply the Color OOps to the ends first and minimal amount to the roots.  By the way, I dye my own hair and I have never gone to the salon to have it diet or strippe dor whatnot, its just cheaper that way and sois Color Oops!  Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> BACKGROUND (skip if you don&#x27;t care):&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had streaks of crazy colors (i.e., silver, pink, red, purple, blue, etc.) in my hair for the last 10 years but they were always somewhat hidden in the under-layers for a peek-a-boo effect that made them easy to hide if I needed to (for example, professional work events). About 7 weeks ago, I finally got bored of my color streaks and decided to jump on the ombre bandwagon. I have long, black, straight Asian hair that almost touches my elbows so I went dramatic and had it fade from natural black on top to platinum blonde at the ends. It looked exactly how I wanted it to...for all of 3 days before the blonde half started turning more brassy yellow, like a terrible dye job. In hindsight, I should have just purchased something like [[ASIN:B000O5UWTA Schwarzkopf Bonacure Color Save Silver Shampoo 8.5oz]] to tone out the brassiness but instead, I decided on what I thought was the safer and more familiar route at the time and had my stylist throw [[ASIN:B004KEX6OE Jerome Russell Punky Colour Cream Flamingo Pink]] (probably my favorite hair color of all time) over everything to cover up the yellow. It sounds bright but is actually a very deep raspberry/black cherry color, which nicely complemented my dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROBLEM:&lt;br /&gt;About 2 weeks ago (i.e., 5 weeks after dying my hair Flamingo Pink), the dark fuchsia started to turn noticeably lighter and brighter than I would like. Like all semi-permanent fashion colors, I knew this color change was coming but usually had to only deal with a few chunky streaks of my hair doing this at a time. In this case, with 90% of my hair in the previously-bleached-ombre-then-dyed-pink state, the brightness was getting pretty obnoxious. If I could leave it be, it&#x27;d turn to an almost neon pink within the next month and then slowly fade into a dark pink pastel followed by baby pink. While I do love the baby pink look, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d be able to handle this in-between color for the next4-5 months so I headed to my nearest drug store, Walgreen&#x27;s. While browsing the hair color aisle for a black or dark brown color to cover my bright pink hair, I stumbled onto [[ASIN:B0012JY4G4 Color Oops Hair Color Remover, Extra Strength 1 Application]] and decided to research it on here. Although it does explicitly say that it won&#x27;t remove \\&quot;direct color dyes such as bright pinks, blues, greens, etc...\\&quot;, some of the reviews led me to believe that there&#x27;s a chance it might remove the pink anyway. If there&#x27;s a chance I could get the original light blonde ombre back, or even blonde with a light pink tint, then I&#x27;d be happy. Worst case, if this didn&#x27;t remove any of the pink, then I can always come back and buy a box of black hair dye later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TODAY:&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions on the box exactly and, as other reviewers have already mentioned, it smells terrible - kind of like a mix between old-school Nair cream and hair bleach at salons. I left the mixture in my hair for exactly 20 minutes, jumped in the shower, shampooed and rinsed twice as instructed. During the rinse, I saw plenty of pink running down the drain so I was definitely hopeful. When I got out of the shower and finally looked in the mirror, however, I saw that my pink hair had completely turned blue! How in the world did that happen? I had bleached platinum-blonde hair with a layer of hot pink on top and when the pink washed out I was left with blue?? I&#x27;m no expert on the color wheel but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not supposed to happen. Perhaps if my hair was purple and I washed out the reds in it, then it&#x27;d turn blue... Who knows. Luckily for me, blue is my second favorite hair color and this blue was a muted medium blueish gray color, which is neither loud nor obnoxious so my mission is achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like the product because it definitely removes hair dyes (even 7-week old punky colors) and I can&#x27;t penalize it too much for my crazy result because it warned me that it&#x27;s notmeant to be used on direct color dyes. But, the smell is really horrible and the dry, dry, dry texture it left my hair feeling has plenty of room for improvement. I have a feeling I will be going through alot of [[ASIN:B001AO0WCG Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment 3.4 Oz Bottle with Blue Box]] and [[ASIN:B000ZLVUYO It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Hair Mask , 8-Ounces Jars]] in the very near future.</li>
    <li> I see alot of reviews about how it worked for hair that was darkened, so I thought I would add my experience with lightening my hair.  I am a natural dirty dishwater blonde (light ash brownish).  Really a blah color.  I have been dying my hair for 10+ years.  for the past couple years I have been using feria #73 which I love!  I decided today that I wanted to go more blonde with less red tones for the summer.  The store didnt have any feria in a lighter blonde so I opted for garnier #80.  Mistake!!  I noticed a problem as I was rinsing out the dye from my hair as it was looking way too dark while wet.  After I finished drying it, my hair was a dingy ash brownish green!  had a terrible green in it!! I went and picked up some Color Oops and put in the whole bottle waiting the full 20 minutes.  I rinsed and shampooed a total of 5 times.  The box does say it can take out new color and that it can also remove green tints on lightened hair and it does!!!  I conditioned my hair after with a whole tube of left over conditioner from a hair coloring box, leaving the conditioner on for 30 minutes because my hair really felt like hay.  But, I couldnt be happier!  My hair is the beach blonde I was looking for to begin with and no GREEN! So,  If you happen to lighten and end up greenish it can help.  The stuff does have a stinky smell to it, but it wont kill you.  I have smelled way worse with different hair dying products and keratin treatments.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all. I was really hoping that it would. A friend told me about it as it worked great for her and she raved about it. And I see other reviewers had great success. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. I guess I had too much color in my hair. I did exactly what I was supposed to. I ended up just cutting off a lot of my hair (my hair was real long) and dying it. I would have given it a one star for me personally but I gave an additional star because I know the product does work for other people, including my friend. (it was almost on the verge of an orangey color by the time I finished)</li>
    <li> Ordered two boxes. My hair was dark and thick. Followed directions exactly and my hair color was not removed. Ended up bleaching to the color I wanted but really wanted this product to work so I could avoid the damage bleach does.</li>
    <li> Long Story Short:&lt;br /&gt;Current Dark Red dyejob + 2 years of experimental dyejobs + Color Oops &#x3D; MY BEAUTIFUL STRAWBERRY BLONDE HAIR BACK!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the typical bad maneuver.  Got bored, bought a box color, came home and *gasp* got bad results.  I took my formerly dark strawberry blonde hairs and dyed them a deep unnatural purple red.  I went to a salon where the stylists told me I was pretty much F&#x27;d without a color strip, bleaching and two sessions of redyeing, one two weeks after the first.  Ummmm....no.  I wanted instant gratification at a cheap price, and I really wasn&#x27;t looking forward to one fun filled week of walking around with fried hair and being at least a hundred dollars poorer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, kindly I said thank you and left the salon.  I figured I&#x27;d wear my new color with my head high at least until I could find a salon that could be recommended and I trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening my boyfriend bought me Loreal Color Zap from Sally&#x27;s.  It seemed like a godsend, until you actually read the label and find out that it&#x27;s all bleach.  So before I put that into my hair, he (being the sweet man he is) drove to Walgreens and bought Color Oops.  Without bleach or ammonia it was sure to at least be more gentle than the Color Zap.  It fixed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twenty minutes later, and about ten minutes into the process of putting the solution on my mid-back length hair I was already seeing it lighten.  I had seen my hair lighten once before when I home bleached it and that was right before my bangs basically crunched and broke off.  So, I didn&#x27;t think I was out of deep water yet, but I got in the shower, rinsed, washed, repeated, four times, used Aussie 3 Minute Miracle, blow-dried and tossed around my beautiful hair like one of the Charlie&#x27;s Angels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please ladies, before you bleach, before you pay uber bucks at the salon, try this Color Oops.  Even if for whatever reason it doesn&#x27;t have the same miraculous results that mine did, it will not damage your hair and a stylist can always redye it.  But, it&#x27;s a miracle product to me and I&#x27;m thrilled to have my natural color back.  Well worth the time, money, effort and most importantly, the results.can always redye it.  But, it&#x27;s a miracle product to me and I&#x27;m thrilled to have my natural color back.  Well worth the time, money, effort and most importantly, the results.</li>
    <li> I wanted to go a little darker than my light golden brown/really dark blonde hair(with a few grays) and bought a level 3 \\&quot;rich golden brown\\&quot; hair dye.  It went WAY too dark...almost black with some red highlights.  I washed it after coloring and tried a lemon juice/conditioner combo that slightly lightened it to a super dark brown with some red highlights.  The next day I tried this miracle product Color Oops after reading every review that I could find.  I cut a small strand of hair from behind my ear to test, and it came out exactly the color I wanted.  So I went for it.  I followed the directions exactly, which is really time-consuming.  The application took a few minutes then I left it on for about 17 minutes hoping my hair wouldn&#x27;t go orange and straw-like.  I then rinsed, shampooed (clarifying) and rinsed for 15 minutes, shampooed again (moisturizing), rinsed for 5 more minutes, then put on a 3 minute miracle conditioner for about 10 minutes.  I could tell a HUGE difference when I rinsed it out.  I combed my hair and let it air dry and now it is the exact color that I wanted.  It looks completely natural and is a rich golden brown with red and gold highlights in the sun.  I&#x27;m not going to color it again because it looks SO good.  I do see a few random gray hairs underneath, but you can&#x27;t tell unless I lift my hair.  I still can&#x27;t believe it worked!  And my hair is super soft and shiny, probably due to the deep conditioning and the fact that I never blow dry it.  The smell isn&#x27;t great, but neither is the smell of hair dye.  Awesome, incredible, unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I color my hair red all the time, usually with the intent of a roasted red pepper meets nutmeg color. I dyed my hair red as usual and it turned into this snake-lady atheist-goth burgundy color. I tried to live with it for a day or two but it was just not the color I wanted. I&#x27;ve been blessed with a healthy head of hair that&#x27;s smooth, straight, thick, soft, and shiny and I take great pride in keeping that way. I was terrified to use this stuff, thinking it was going to damage my hair beyond repair or turn it into some ridiculous unfixable color. After using it, I washed it twice with a shampoo designed for strengthening long hair then once again with a protein-enriched shampoo and conditioner. Much to my shock, awe, and delight, the product not only removed the cherry-chocolate disaster, but it gave me the precise gingery color that I had been wanting all along!! Plus, my hair is still smooth, shiny, soft, and not anymore damaged than the usual results from coloration and daily care. I&#x27;m literally overjoyed-- think Julie Andrews on the mountaintop! I&#x27;m never going to color my hair that drastically again, but if I do next time, I know Color Oops will be my saving grace. :)</li>
    <li> I went an expensive salon in New York City to have my light red hair dyed a slightly darker red.  When the stylist was finished, my hair looked straight up BLACK with a reddish tone to it.  I nearly died in my chair.  I was so shocked that I couldn&#x27;t say anything to the lady and instead I went home and cried.  My friend mentioned Color Oops to me, so I went out the following morning and bought a box.  I made sure to follow the directions to a T and all of the yucky black red color disappeared!  I really didn&#x27;t expect it to because my hair was very, very light (almost strawberry blonde) before, but it did!  This is a miracle in a box, and I would recommend it to anyone who had an unfortunate dying mishap.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I just could not help it this time because this product really saved my hair. I died my blond hair brown and it looked terrible, so I tried red over it and it didnt help much as it was still way too dark for me. So desperate, I decided to use Oops as a last instance and my hair went back to blond within 6 minutes and it looks great!!!</li>
    <li> So I dyed my hair red and it came out a fire engine red with my bangs practically pink. It was bad. I ran to the store and picked this stuff up and it totally saved my hair!! Thank goodness for this product, it restored my hair back to blonde and its a little stinky but totally worth it! Just a warning don&#x27;t drop it on your skin, it burns!!</li>
    <li> I used color oops and after reading so many great reviews I had hopes that I could get very close to my natural color and I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep dying my hair anymore, at the end of the process my hair was a orange color luckily I had bought natural instincts in light brown because I wanted my color change to be gentle so people didn&#x27;t have the immediate shock that my hair was now a lighter brown that before. After apply and washing out the new color though my hair was extremely dark brown. Luckily Natural Instincts isn&#x27;t permanent but if you are planning to re dye your hair after do choose a lighter shade than normal or buy a protein filler other wise your hair will most likely turn out darker than expected. I am pleased enough with what the product did though. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This was amazing!!!  I made a horrible decision to change hair color brands.  What was supposed to be a gentle light red/blond came out metallic red.  I was horrified.  Picked up a bottle of Oops and used it immediately.  The awful color was gone, leaving my hair a very natural reddish blond.  What was nice was that the roots had held enough of the color that I won&#x27;t have to recolor for a while.</li>
    <li> Backstory: Basically I&#x27;ve always wanted red hair but was never ballsy enough to go through it. I&#x27;ve always loved Ariel from the little mermaid and her red hair, but me being a \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; undertoned, i thought it would show too much of my yellowness which already shows alot. BUT THEN, Ariana Grande stepped into the scene with her \\&quot;Magenta\\&quot; hair and I just HAD to have that color. I was obsessed. I was googling, reading, watching videos on red hair/how to maintain it, basically everyday. Now keep in mind I&#x27;m 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I dyed my hair red, and when I washed my hair it was dry as could be (I didn&#x27;t bleach it)[[ASIN:B000A409BG L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Hicolor Hilights Magenta 1.2 oz.]] but it was the red I wanted, it was just... Unneaven and brighter than I expected it to be. So basically, I hated it at first glance and wanted to take it out right away, but I didn&#x27;t. I dealt with it for a month since it was \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; and when the month rolled around.. the color hadn&#x27;t faded not even the tiniest bit.. But my roots grew though (daaaaaaaark brown) so as usually I started searching for ways to fade it, even if just a little bit and you STILL have to keep in mind it&#x27;s still bright red.&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t find anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, I dyed my hair back in October and didn&#x27;t get the red out to January of THIS year. I used Color Oops reg. strength the first time since I had fine hair, and followed the directions to the T. It only lightened the redness to a light blonde/orange on the \\&quot;roots\\&quot;., SO, I got extra strength and left it in for 3 HOURS. Yes, 3. That&#x27;s how bad I wanted the red out + I was losing track of time anyways. This time I applied it more evenly than \\&quot;all over\\&quot; and when the color oops was still in my hair, I couldn&#x27;t tell if the red was coming out or not so I had to go in NATURAL sunlight to see and luckily enough I had \\&quot;honey brown\\&quot; hair color (my natural hair color is like a dark, chestnut brown). So I washed it out and THNAKFULLY had little to no damage since my hair is pretty healthy besides the split ends I have yet to cut. I then deep conditioned with L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Sulfate free line which worked like a charm. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am VERY pleased with my results. The only things I would advise you to do is DO NOT dye your hair IMMEDIATELY after you wash it because ONE you need to deep condition it because it WILL dry out your hair and TWO I&#x27;d give it a day or two to darken (thats what it did to me. It was a bright-ish orange with blonde and brown and then it settled to a nice brown thats NOT my natural hair color but I still like it anyways so eh). Also, do not put this on \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair. It didn&#x27;t do anything when I did it, but still.. I wouldn&#x27;t risk it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY DECOLORING.</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, I&#x27;m a brunette, dye my hair at home monthly....bought a new color in dark brown, came out black. Half my head was black, the bottom half medium brown, looked like a skunk. Was distressed, read reviews on color oops and decided to take a chance.....yippeeeeee. Took all the black out, back to my normal brown color. I&#x27;m soooooo grateful!  Follow the instructions verbatim!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always dyed my hair using box colors and never had any trouble. Last week, I chose a medium ash brown color from Nice n Easy. I already had medium/light browm hair with some old highlights. Imagine my shock when I unwrapped my hair after rinsing the color out to see a head full of BLACK hair! JET...BLACK...HAIR! OMG! Immediate panic mode set in and I thought about crying and shaving my head. I immediately called my hair salon and was quoted a price of $100 AN HOUR for \\&quot;color correction\\&quot; that might not even work! Ugh! I began googling other solutions and stumbled upon Color Oops. I must have red over a hundred reviews. I knew I had to do something so I took the plunge and prayed I wouldn&#x27;t end up bald or with orange hair. Luckily, I still have a full head of hair and it is actually a pretty dark brown color with some red tint to it. Color Oops says you can re-dye your hair the same day but I like my color so I chose not to risk further consequences. As otber reviewers have stated, the most important thing to do with this product is FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS TO A T! Yes, you&#x27;re going to get bored rinsing and you&#x27;re going to feel like cheating on the rinse time but DON&#x27;T! Do yourself and your hair a favor and keep rinsing! If you don&#x27;t, your hair will just turn darker in the next 24 hours. My hair felt like straw while I was rinsing but I used Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo and Aussie 3 Minute Miracle conditioner. My hair is now feeling and looking MUCH better. (I left the conditioner on for 25 minutes). My hair is still a little dark for my taste but definitely not the scary, \\&quot;I&#x27;m trying to re-live my teenager days\\&quot; jet black shade it originally was. Thank goodness I found this product or I&#x27;d be sitting in the salon, shelling out money I don&#x27;t really have. I think I&#x27;ve learned my lesson about box color though. NEVER AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> So I have to say that I am a pretty cautious person.  I am 40-something with naturally medium brown hair mixed with a lot of gray.  I decided a while back to go a little darker to a chocolate brown color and loved it, but the salon was getting really expensive and it took so long to get in around my schedule.  The first time I decided to color my hair from a box, I got the temporary color, in case it didn&#x27;t work out.  I loved the temporary color and decided that I wanted something more permanent.  So I purchased the same brand, same color in a permanent solution, colored my hair and when it was done it came out black.  Yuck!  I should have realized it would do that when the solution turned this blue color as I was leaving it sit on my hair.  I think someone messed up the packaging and there is nothing on the bottle to reassure you.  Anyway, I had black hair.  I got on the internet and found all these wonderful reviews for Color Oops.  I read all the reviews and gained a lot of good advice if I was going to go through with it.  Again I tend to be cautious. so when my husband came home, I asked him what he thought.  He said, \\&quot;it is really black.  It reminds me of Elvira.\\&quot;  Ok that was it, I became desperate to fix it.  I drove to my local drugstore and they had Oops Color remover.  I grabbed it, along with a box of Light Natural Brown in case I had to redye it. (Other reviewers said that if you get a color to redye get at least 2 shades lighter than what you want because your hair will be more porous).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box, and read the directions carefully. Other reviewers said to practically memorize the directions.  I took them seriously.  Before starting I made sure to cut some hair from the back of my head and do a strand test.  So far so good,  Working quickly, I applied the stuff all over, put on the cap, and sat in front of my laptop for 20 minutes.  When it was done I reset the timer and hopped in the shower, shampooed, and rinsed, and rinsed, and rinsed.  It was the longest 20 minutes of my life and I felt my arms were going to fall off, but I wanted to make sure I could get as much of the stuff out as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was done rinsing, I blow dried and about cried.  My ends were the perfect color, a rich warm chocolatey brown, but my roots were bright red. Like flaming red.  Thank God I bought the other box of color. I put the other color on, remembering to only let it sit for 5 minutes, and then rinsed.  While my roots ended up about a shade lighter than my ends, the red was completely covered.  Hallelujah!!!!  I am not going to touch it for at least 6 weeks and we will see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Didn&#x27;t damage my hair and lightened the color&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Ended up with flaming red roots&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the other reviews carefully.  I gained more knowledge than the directions on the box would have ever given me.ed.

    <li> This smelled terrible and I had to buy 2 boxes to even get a bit of hair dye from my hair. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> My beautiful blonde highlights were getting to be too much upkeep.  It was starting to look more like an all over color.  Should have simly asked for low light BUT instead the stylist at a top Philly hair salon told me color would work best.  Left the salon with what some may think is a beautiful color but way too dark for me and I now had one color but just dark - UGLY to me.  Bought Color OOps from CVS and followed directions to a T.  Lightened hair but lots of orange and brassiness but at least I could go to work!  Next day . . . when I get home from work - I was disgusted at looking at the hieous mess for the entire day.  Here is where I loose my mind.  Wash with Dawn Dish detergent, Prell, and my home bottle of hydrogen peroxide drugstore 3%.  Hair goes from orange to brown but not as brown as the day it was colored.  Very hideous, less orange, but still hideous.  Call my sister&#x27;s salon and book a color correction for next day.  Stylist fixes the mess and I love the way it looks again.  Bottom line- Color OOps can get you through until you can see a stylist BUT it is not going to get you back to where you started just hold you over until a professional can make sense of it all.  The reason for the four stars is that the professional said it lifted a lot of the color without damaging my hair and it can get you through the day until you can see a professional.  My advice get lowlights if you want to go darker NOT full on color!!  TOO DRASTIC of a change for a life-long blonde!!</li>
    <li> First of all, I want to point out the things I have done to my fine, straight hair: Dyed it red for over a year, then a \\&quot;change of pace\\&quot; to black, then tried to lighten it with some... lightening... brown color dye (only worked on my roots) and then left my hair alone, sat in a corner and cried.  Now, I bought this stuff not expecting much: my hair was black, and not even a lightener could change it. But my mindset was \\&quot;Hey, the only really awful things it could do at this point is make my hair fall out\\&quot;. So, I went to CVS, bought an overpriced box, and went home with little hope it would do anything.   Boy was I wrong. When you mix the two chemicals together, it creates some kind of godly reaction that is designed to demolish dark hair colors in twenty minutes, and that&#x27;s exactly what it did. The black was gone after the first rinse, I reapplied, rinsed again and my hair was so light. Science, bro.  Anyway, the makers of this stuff, in all their fantastic glory, decided Hey, we&#x27;re going to market this stuff, girls can strip the permanent or semi-permanent color from their hair, AND THEN THEY CAN DYE OVER IT.   And that&#x27;s exactly what I futhermuckin&#x27; did.  I used a warm auburn shade of Loreal Superior, and it held great. The color came out a little darker than I wanted, but that is warned of on the box.  In summary, this stuff is wonderful, and it says inside the box (and on the back) that it works best on lighter hair dyed darker. So, it&#x27;ll work best if you dye your hair brown to black, but if you lighten your way it won&#x27;t work as well, if at all. Also, it may take a couple applications to get all of the color out, and I recommend conditioning with some serious Redken before dying over it. It&#x27;s very mild and is pretty much my saviour.</li>
    <li> This product works! I just now used it after coloring my medium blonde/white hair with dark blonde hair color (Grey Solution by Nice N Easy) and it looked more like dark brown! After using Color Oops, my hair is now a nice shade of strawberry blonde. I don&#x27;t even have to recolor it. The Color Oops does stink to high heaven though! I wish I could add photos here so you could see the before and after.</li>
    <li> I usually color my hair a mid brown but chose a different brand with a hint of mahogany - colored my hair last night and woke up with red roots followed by a deep almost black color - not pretty!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews decided to rush out to my local drugstore to pick up a box of this. It was simple to use and did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin - the smell is really not bad at all, its actually far less potent than hair dye itself!! It smell is an issue to you you could light some incense sticks - I had a burner with some essential oil going as I figured I was going to be stuck in the bathroom a while! But honestly the smell is not that bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is simple, the biggest issue is simply time. You mix the contents of one bottle with another and apply. This is very runny liquid and a bit tricky to apply, as first I found it going everywhere so used caution and found one application was enough for my hair which is just below shoulder length!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You leave it on for 20 minutes, then shampoo and rinse for 20 minutes - this I found to be the biggest nuisance. I suggest taking some sort of timer with you as 20 minutes is longer than it seems (I also suggest taking some body scrub, maybe a face mask as you are stuck in the shower for 20 minutes might as well make the time useful!) Then I applied shampoo again, rinsed for 5 minutes, used a deep conditioner and I was done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really did take the color out of my hair. The length of my hair returned to a pretty brown that was a tad lighter than normal  - I did however end up with an orange root line which I had expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It states you can color right away...some folks wait but for me, orange roots was not the look I planned to show off at work tomorrow! So after drying my hair and leaving the length a little damp to prevent color absorption, I colored again!! It tells you that your hair might absorb more color so I chose a light brown, 15 minutes on the roots and 5 on the length!! I am glad I chose a lighter color as it deep indeed turn into a deeper brown, so IMPORTANT, IF YOU COLOR YOU HAIR AGAIN AFTER USING THIS GO A SHADE OR TWO LIGHTER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now brown, no hint of red or orange, and it feels great from the deep conditioner!! Very impressed with this, it works well just follow the instructions!r as it deep indeed turn into a deeper brown, so IMPORTANT, IF YOU COLOR YOU HAIR AGAIN AFTER USING THIS GO A SHADE OR TWO LIGHTER!

    <li> I was extremely hesitant to try Color Oops after reading the reviews on here and a few other sites, but I was desperate to get the red dye out of my hair. This was my last resort and it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my hair background:&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally blonde hair that I have been dying religiously ever since I decided to dye it black (terrible idea) in middle school. I&#x27;m nineteen now. I haven&#x27;t seen my hair its natural color since then, as I am constantly dying it to keep up with the blonde roots/dark brown hair dilemma. Basically, I have years of color on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About four months ago I decided to get my hair dyed bright auburn at the salon, and although I loved it for a while, I don&#x27;t have the time/money to keep it up. I tried to dye over the red with a brown box dye, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. I researched different ways of stripping hair color without bleaching, and I came across Color Oops and shampooing with Head and Shoulders. I started the Head and Shoulders method and it actually got a LOT of the color out of my hair. After using head and shoulders multiple times for a couple of weeks, most of the red color was out and I wasn&#x27;t seeing any more dye wash out of my hair in the shower. However, my hair still had a strong red tint that I wanted to get rid of. That&#x27;s where Color Oops came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aftermath:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to give an in depth review of the process, as a couple of people gave some really good advice here already. But I do have some comments on the aftermath of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I mixed some coconut oil in with [[ASIN:B000VHO1F2 VO5 TOTAL HAIR RECOVERY Size: 1 OZ]] as a post-treatment conditioner and my hair came out feeling healthier and shinier than it was before the process. I would definitely recommend using some kind of deep conditioner/oil treatment after the fact, but my hair honestly did not feel damaged at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My hair did not turn out anywhere near my natural light blonde color, but it didturn out very light. It&#x27;s true that the color darkens overnight, so don&#x27;t be alarmed if your hair looks super light orange at first. My hair ended up a very natural looking dark blonde/light brown color that I have actually gotten many complements on. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I still found that I had a little bit of a red tint to my hair, so I used [[ASIN:B002PMLGVI L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colorist Secrets Brass Banisher Hair Treatment]] and that got rid of any brassiness that I had. I would definitely recommend that product too if you&#x27;re having problems getting out red tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would definitely recommend this product. It got rid of the red dye that I thought I would never be able to get rid of, and the end result looks nice and natural too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been premature gray since I was 17 and coloring that long (I&#x27;m 40) except up until 2 years ago when I quit color cold turkey.  After a grueling year of growing out my hair, I found that I was snow white on top with salt &amp; pepper peek-a-boo at the nape of my neck.  For the most part, I was comfortable with the color until a week of feeling sick along with ONE critical comment that I should color my hair because it made me look old sent me back to the box.  As soon as the color hit my head, I regretted going back to the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fast forward another year and here I am going through the grueling process of growing it out again.  I have been dark brown for the entire dye process but am now 3 boxes into blonde, toners of all kinds, and I can&#x27;t seem to lighten the brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the OOPs today...here I go..................................45 mins.........application, wait, shampoo, condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok back, my hair was a yellow/white at the roots when I began today with a yellow tinge where the color has been fading then graduates to dark brown ends.  The OOPS lifted my box brown to a strawberry blonde color leaning slightly Weasley red on the lighter side.  My white has returned at the roots and the yellow is gone. The nape of my neck is salt and pepper, evidently the box color I had back there was cut out today during my hair cut.  I had brown hair with a yellow/white skunk stripe on my part about 3\\&quot; wide and now it all kind of blends.  I won&#x27;t recolor but I may go get some bleach next week and Manic Panic in Snow so I can move this process along faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roots no longer have a straight skunk line and there are areas that the color was lifted so it looks like my hair has been through a frosting cap. It&#x27;s nice but I make an awful blonde so I will keep working with it until I can bring it to anime white at the top. Tonight I have an event so I will style it and use spray white/silver hairspray to counter the blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp kind of tingles and the process smells so I have a bit of headache.  If you are sensitive, don&#x27;t skip the strand test, this stuff doesn&#x27;t mess around.  Going to give my head a rest.ls so I have a bit of headache.  If you are sensitive, don&#x27;t skip the strand test, this stuff doesn&#x27;t mess around.  Going to give my head a rest.</li>
    <li> I very much liked that this product was easier to use than other color removers I have tried. The smell, yes, was horrible, but of course it didn&#x27;t last long. It took out just about all of my color, some was still left because I was nervous about how much damage I was causing to my already fragile hair. I did use my best Bumble &amp; Bumble conditioners afterwards and my hair felt good as new!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair black, like jet black, and I&#x27;ve stuck with it for a few years but I got tired of it and could not figure out how to get rid of it. So I bought this today, and I used it immediately. It works great! I left it on for the full 20 minutes to make sure that it gets all that it can and I only washed my hair about 3 times, so probably about 20-25 minutes. It took out all the black. Though it did leave the ends a bit dark, but they&#x27;re no longer black. It does smell pretty strong though, I thought it stunk a little but hey, it goes away. I suggest buying the protein conditioner thing to help with the next time you color your hair. I colored mine immediately after and by the time I finished putting the color in my shoulder length hair it needed to be rinsed out. So it takes color pretty quickly. But it worked great for me (:</li>
    <li> Color Oops definitely took out some of my dye color, but I was hoping for better results overall.  I have light brownish-red hair naturally, with some grey.  4 months ago I used a temporary color that was a darker browinsh-red, but it never really washed completely out.  The color looked great until it started growing out and my light-brownish-grey hair started becoming more and more visible at the roots.  I was hoping this product would remove the old color to balance out the two so I could recolor with another temporary color.  I can&#x27;t say it did that at all.  The dyed part of the hair is much lighter, so it took the color out, but I guess the dye has permanently colored my hair.  I&#x27;m not brave enough to go to a stronger bleaching remover.  If the dye had washed out and gotten close to my natural color (which wasn&#x27;t really that far off from the dyed color, just without the grey) then I would have been a lot happier.  As it is, I will still have to put on another color to balance the new brown &amp; grey roots with the lighter reddish length.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!   i had been dying my blonde hair red for about a year when i decided to try to new shade from a different brand that i had never used.  it was the wierdest most indescribable color,  neon orange in some areas and purple at the ends ugggghhh!!!  i went to the store immediatly and bought this stuff.  20 minutes later i had my blonde hair back.  it was not exactly my natural color blonde - i think if i had done a few time tests as reccomended i could have had my natural color but i was too impatiant but i didnt really care it was such a huge improvement i was thrilled and it was close enough that no one even noticed that anything was different.  highly reccomended!!!!!!    PS i had a friend who used this on black hair dye and didnt have any problems.</li>
    <li> Some idi0t at Super Cuts messed my hair up by putting black-brown dye over bleached blond hair.  My hair looked like a witch wig.  This product didn&#x27;t completely fade the black-brown, but faded it to a really great lighter brown tone that goes really, really well with the rest of my hair color.  Color Oops was a lifesaver--I was embarrassed to leave the house.    I only gave it 4 stars because it was good enough for me, but there is a comparison of before and after colors on the side of the box and I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t that drastically effective.  It may not be as helpful to others who want to COMPLETELY rid their hair of all dyed color.  However, I think in the case of Color Oops, it may be a good idea to leave it on longer to process than 20 minutes.  Perhaps 30 minutes; it won&#x27;t be dangerous.    A few last things--it&#x27;s kind of runny and VERY stinky.  Like, rancid.  I rinsed it for 15 minutes and washed it 3 times and my hair still smells like the product--EGGS.  It&#x27;s worth it though :) a little perfume with fix that quick, I&#x27;m sure.    Overall, I completely recommend this product because a bad dye job is awful and hard to deal with.  This product with help make it manageable.</li>
    <li> My story starts in a hair salon with an overly zealous colorist who didn&#x27;t listen to me, but instead decided to do what SHE wanted to my hair.  Something about Ombre color.  Result? Too dark (almost-black) hair with orange streaks.  I died.      I went back to her and she said something about not being able to lift color with color so she would get rid of the streaks and make it all one color.  I walked out of there looking like a very angry Morticia Adams.    So this morning I wasn&#x27;t even looking for this product, I was hunting for a similar product but as luck would have it, my local beauty supply store was out of it.  I saw this product on the shelf and thought to myself anything I end up with HAS to be better than what I&#x27;ve got..so I gave it a shot.     I coated my hair liberally with it and combed it through, left it on for about 15 mins (the box states 20, but I was sweating bullets at this point, wondering what the hell I was going to end up with).  I rinsed the bejesus out of my hair (as the box states).  I must have stood under the shower for 15 mins, rinsing, shampooing, rinsing some more, shampooing once again and finally, I added a liberal coating of Redken conditioner.  Left that in for a few mins and stood there rinsing for another 5 mins.    I dried my hair and to my delight, my hair turned a beautiful shade of warm, medium brown with lighter highlights (where the dreaded orange streaks once lived).  I am sure it was just a happy accident, but I ended up with the color I wanted when I first walked into the salon! Go figure.    Love, love this product!  Oh - and here&#x27;s a tip..get yourself some Redken conditioner. (The heavy-duty stuff that comes in a tube, also available at beauty supply stores). This stuff STINKS to high heaven, but Redken conditioner not only conditions your hair well after this process but helps kill the bad smell you&#x27;re left with.      I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK!&lt;br /&gt;I had dyed my hair about a month ago blue using Spat!  I used this twice on my hair and it made no meaningful change.  After that I called the manufacturer and they told me that &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; is not an &amp;#34;artificial color&amp;#34; (which the box says it removes).  The box does not say this exclusion on it anywhere!  The manufacturer then implied that their product not working was my fault.  Buy something else, as this is useless</li>
    <li> It worked as expected.&lt;br /&gt;A natural dirty blonde,  I have been dying my hair many shades of red for about five years.  Professionally colored countless times,  multiple box dyes, manic panic (my hair is very porous), and other generic punk red dyes. Red is insanely hard to get out,  which is why I stuck with the color for so long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ready to take the long journey of going back to blonde, and I want to take it slow.&lt;br /&gt;The last professional color I had was about two months ago, and it was a very very deep and dark red. This color did not fade AT All, so I didn&#x27;t want to start bleaching at this point.&lt;br /&gt;I bought color oops at Walmart for 9.99, and did one application. I should have done another, but the smell was too much for my sensitive sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;it brought my hair to a pretty ginger color, I&#x27;d say about 3 shades lighter. And my hair wasn&#x27;t damaged at all. I didn&#x27;t shampoo as rigorous as the other reviewers did,  maybe that&#x27;s why.  But I did leave my hair under the running water for the whole 15 minutes. I also did a deep conditioning afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend to those that are realistic about their results. Remember everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I think my hair will be fully stripped after I get the guts to withstand the smell of a second application.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair dark brown for several years now. recently when I went to buy my regular color they were out. I figured I could use the natural black and it would just stay very dark a little longer. I was wrong, wrong, wrong. It turned out jet black and made me look like a hag!    I researched about the different color removal products and decided to go with Color Oops. It was really runny and I was worried i wouldn&#x27;t have enough for my long hair. It was no problem. I was able to comb through it after I applied all the product just to make sure everything was covered. then I just clipped it up in back and waited the 20 minutes. I realized when my time was up that my hair still felt pretty cold and it clearly states to do it in a warm room. For an extra 10 minutes I layed by my electric baseboard heater just to make sure it would all come out.    I was surprised when I started rinsing that I didn&#x27;t actually see any color coming out because that was what I had expected. It rinsed about 5 minutes, shampooed, rinsed another five shampooed again and rinsed another 5 minutes. I could tell even in the shower that my hair was much lighter.    Now I am back to my medium brown hair. My ends aren&#x27;t even darker. My hair is just a little dry but some extra conditioning should take care of that. I feel sooooo much better!!! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So grateful for this product!  Hair was colored lilac (bright purple) and NOTHING would touch it.  My Color Oops arrived yesterday and 20 minutes later my hair was back to blond.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I had to review this product because I was astonished at the results.  I have been dying my hair (naturally medium brown) dark brown to cover grays for the last 15 years. A few weeks ago, I got sick of all the touch-ups required due to quick fading and the resulting brassy color, so I went with a color called \\&quot;darkest brown\\&quot; which I should have know to interpret as \\&quot;black\\&quot;.  I did dye my hair black in my early twenties, and it was very striking and looked good, but at 36 I just looked like some crazy lady!  Anyway, I found the new color unbearable after 2 weeks and was about to call my stylist to get my hair color stripped.  Then I remembered having it stripped as a teenager and it being $150 back then and they had to cut most of my hair off anyway! So, I figured why not try it myself first. I googled the predicament, found Color Oops and headed off to Walgreen&#x27;s to get some.   I did the strand test and was disappointed--I could not see any difference in the color. So, I was not going in with very high expectations when I applied it to all my hair.  I followed the directions to a tee--rinsing that long seems crazy, but as others have said, I think it is the key.  Most complaints of people saying that their hair smelled really bad after may not have rinsed long enough, because my hair only had a very mild residue of odor after the two shampoos prescribed. Anyway, the results: this product stripped my color back to the medium-dark brown I was accustomed to and I didn&#x27;t even need to recolor to correct anything (which I was prepared to do).  So, while it&#x27;s not going to strip you to natural if you&#x27;ve been coloring for a while, it will lighten up black dye to a reasonable, \\&quot;ok to leave the house again\\&quot; color! Condition profusely for a few days and you&#x27;re back to normal!</li>
    <li> I had dyed my 80-90% gray hair light bown, from Natural Instincts.  Though I had used this product many times in the past, it never washed out after 3 months like it used to and should have.  It was too dark and I wanted to get rid of it.  I read about Oops and all the many different opinions, and I thought I would give it a try.  I read the instructions through 3 times, as I read some people weren&#x27;t reading them.  I followed it step by step.  When I was finished, my hair hadn&#x27;t changed one bit...still the same darkish brown!  I have learned my lesson...go a bit lighter as you age (I just turned 53) and dyes tend to be darker than they show on the box (I was shocked how my mostly gray hair sucked it up!).</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this last night at Walmart not off amazon. Still, same stuff right? I have been dying my hair black for many many years so build up is definitely a thing. My natural hair color is a dark brown. So I followed the directions to the T and left this on for the maximum amount of time recommended and it worked but not as much as I would have liked. My hair is still darker than its natural color after using this. I have a shadow box of fuscia which I also applied this to but it did nothing. Mainly tried to focus this stuff on the ends of my hair where it&#x27;s been dyed multiple times. Still black. Closer to the roots however it&#x27;s much much lighter. The box does say it doesn&#x27;t remove colors like pink, blue, etc etc and also mentions multiple treatments for hair that&#x27;s been dyed multiple times. Overall I&#x27;m pleased to see it worked somewhat which means I didn&#x27;t entirely waste my money but maybe a stronger brand would be in order.</li>
    <li> When I was getting a haircut at SuperCuts I let them talk me into a free hair coloring to eliminate some grey hair. They turned my brown hair black and it looked like a rug. One treatment of Color Ooopz ands it&#x27;s mostly back to its original color.</li>
    <li> It was a disappointment. We followed the instructions exactly. But it didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t do a thing to my hair by adding this product. Does this product have to be applied immediately after a bad hair dye? Well, I&#x27;ve had my bad hair dye for a year. I&#x27;m trying to transition to a natural grey in my older age. So I wanted to remove the processed/colored hair. It didn&#x27;t work. It may be that I have kinky dredlocks and I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years before I locked my hair. Granted, it may work in other scenarios, but definitely not mine. I&#x27;ve since cut off the colored strands.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take the color out and made my house reek!!!! Terrible smell!!! Not only did it make my house stink it made my hair stink although I have washed it 5 times!! Will never buy ever again!!</li>
    <li> It works like a charm!!!    I showed up ate this hair saloon with a pic of Jenn Aniston in my hands and 3 hours latter left with my hair black and blue (I kid you not!). After crying my eyeballs out, I came to my good buddy, Amazon, looking for the right stuff to fix it.    I did not want to wait for the shipping, so I got it at Wallgreens (2 boxes, believe me). I did the strand test and went for it.    So now my hair is no longer blue or black. It&#x27;s a fairly good looking strawberry blond with platinum highlights. I kind of like it! (Before the \\&quot;accident, my hair had high and lowlights, sort of \\&quot;Gisele Bundchen\\&quot; like).    My advise is: Get this stuff - at least 2 boxes (3 if you have a lot of hair or if you think you might need to apply it twice). CVS doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore in stores, so go to Walgreens. READ THE BOOKLET, follow every step. Do it in a very warm room with no gusts of air coming in. Be sure to saturate your hair with it (I did the ends first b/c that&#x27;s were it looked the darkest, even though the booklet does&#x27;t tell you to do so).     Finally and most important: rinse your hair like your life depends on it! I&#x27;m serious. I rinsed my hair for 20 minutes (i think that&#x27;s the issue everybody who gave it a bad review: poorly rinsing). I also washed my hair with Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo (http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Anti-Residue-Shampoo-12-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B000OLE7WW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1279138945&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3-fkmr1) 6 times (for a total 45 min in the shower!). If you read the booklet, it tells you that rinsing is the most important part of the whole procedure, so do it.    I would say that every hairdresser in the planet should have a few boxes of this in stock for those days when sh... happens. Even with the bad smell (vinegar and bad farts...), it left my hair with a really nice color and very silky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair forever and I wish I knew about this product long ago. I recently switched to coloring my hair with body art henna, which is all natural and can be done over synthetic dyes. The last time I did it, I tried a different brand and wasn&#x27;t as thrilled with the color. So, being impulsive and impatient, I went to the drugstore and bought one of those hair color and highlight duo kits. I had bought one of these when I was much younger and my hair turned green, but I thought it was because I was young and didn&#x27;t pick the right color. This time my hair started as a coppery red, and I picked and deep red with strawberry highlights. Well, I didn&#x27;t do a strand test, because I&#x27;m impatient. My hair was so brown, it was almost black. I&#x27;m a natural red head, I just like to amp up the red, so brown looks very strange on me. There wasn&#x27;t even a hint of red. I did all the tricks you could, baking soda, tide, dawn, lemon juice, chamomile tea. Nothing worked. i was so scared I was going to ruin my hair, and I can&#x27;t afford to get a salon to fix it. So, I went to the drugstore after reading these reviews. I did a strand test! In twenty minutes my hair went from a gross greenish brown to a beautiful strawberry! I am so pleased that this actually worked! I rinsed multiple times for 15 minutes, and shampoo and conditioned at least three times. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged, well besides the damage the kit did to it. I will never let a box kit near my hair again, I&#x27;m sticking with henna. Henna can be mixed with different spices to make blonde, red, brown, black, and everything in between. And if you use body art quality henna, you don&#x27;t have to worry about weird color interactions. check out my favorite site, I&#x27;ve been buying from them for two years and I will never stray again.

    <li> Color oops works! I was able to strip about 5 years of several different colors right down to my natural hair color with just two boxes of the extra strength stuff on the very first try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you follow the directions to the letter and don&#x27;t skimp on the rinsing time or conditioner. Also, be warned that this stuff stinks like a new perm the smell will linger for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will take the color out of fabrics, carpeting and countertops. ;)</li>
    <li> I used Color Oops extra strength tonight. My hair was a dark red when I started. I followed the directions on the package and now it is light brown, very similar to the color it was before I dyed it red. It actually did a better job at removing red hair dye than I expected. The only problem I can see is that it smells really bad, but I can deal with that because it saved me a lot of time and money.</li>
    <li> After months of dying my hair black, it started really falling out. My doctor told me to IMMEDIATELY stop dying it, otherwise I would lose all of my hair. Well, when your original hair color is very light brown, imagine how I would look with half black, half almost blonde hair...awful! I must have read over 60 reviews for color oops and finally decided to try it...what would I lose?  I applied it really fast, waited about 20 mins to wash it off, and finally looked in the mirror: my roots were my natural hair color but my hair was dark, dark brown! I did everything that was asked of... even the 20 min rinsing..which I must say is awful! My hair was very very dry after, however I believe if I try color oops again, it will have a better effect.   It does smell awful though, almost 2 weeks after the discoloring, I can still smell the awful stench of color oops.   It does tend to get darker as the days go off, so you would probably need to do it more than once...if you can stand the smell!</li>
    <li> my hair was colored a light brown before I colored it again. The second coloring I wanted to go a brownish red, using semi-perm color. I left it on for the recommended time and it turned out reddish black! The next day I bought 2 boxes of Oops and it worked great! My hair is now a golden brown-the original color of my hair! Follow instructions explicitly. You will spend a while in the shower, but its crutual to rinsing it all out. It doesn&#x27;t smell that bad, like a mild perm. After shampooing and conditioning, I did not smell anything anymore in my hair. My hair is actually softer than after I colored it the last time. I would highly recomend it. It will NOT repair your hair if you have went from dark to light. It states that about a million times throughout the instructions. Only use if you went darker than what you started out with. Hope this is helpful! Aslo, if your hair is past your shoulders-mine is thick and about 2 inches past my shoulders-you will need to use 2 boxes.</li>
    <li> Color Oops does what it claims. The first time I used it, I wanted to remove black hair dye that had not faded in a year. I didn&#x27;t want to bleach and subsequently ruin my hair, but I was tired of having a good six inches of my normal hair color, then another six of black hair (I am naturally a medium-brown). It worked just as it said on the box and I was back to my natural hair color. It did not strip my hair, did not leave it feeling dry - just as close to my natural color as it could possibly be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was 2 years ago. This time, I had dyed semi-permanent dye (out of a box - yuck... sigh) over my blonde highlights. Well, gave it a week, and the dye was fading, and I missed being blonde. Picked up Color Oops at the local Rite-Aid drugstore. I rinsed for about 25 minutes, yes, it is a long time, but it DOES work. I am not back to the bleach-blonde I was before, but I didn&#x27;t expect to be. At least now if I get my highlights redone, the stylist can actually see where the highlights are from prior to dying ;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a REALLY great product. :)</li>
    <li> THE BACKGROUND:  I was born blond, then it started getting darker in my teens. I tried to fight nature by lightening it back. So, I&#x27;ve been dying my hair so long (23 years) that I don&#x27;t even know what color it is naturally anymore, but probably a light to medium, mousy brown. Now, I am getting some grays at 38.     THE PROBLEM:  I bought some Clairol Natural Instincts Semi-permanent in Medium ash blond by accident. I always use a permanent color in some kind of ash or natural blond. Well, that&#x27;s all I had in the house and I had 3/4\\&quot; roots and some gray peeking through, so I decided to go ahead and use it. I thought the only downside would be the \\&quot;semi-permanent part\\&quot; and conceded to having to re-do the whole process in 1 month instead of 6-8 weeks. Then, CRAP! I got out of the shower and my hair was DARK, DARK brown with some streaks that were almost downright black... from something with the word \\&quot;blond\\&quot; on the box! (The real kicker was the gray was all still there!)    In a panic I got on a chat with Clairol who informed me that as a blond (artificially) this crap won&#x27;t wash out in the 28 washes, but will have to grow out! For 3 days I wore baseballs caps, washed my hair 9 times with dandruff shampoo, lemon juice, &amp; dishwashing detergent (all internet advise). In all fairness it did fade a bit, but I developed some orange highlights-- not pretty with the gray highlights! Keeping it was plainly not an option, so I scoured the internet again and ran into Oops. It seemed like it was worth a try since I was told I&#x27;d pay hundreds to have it stripped.    THE PROCESS:  My test strip was exactly the same for 10 minutes and 20 minutes. I opted to go for the whole 20 minutes and started squirting the watery substance on my head. I followed the directions, except I did put a warm hair dryer on it for just a minute. I know, I know, I should follow directions.... but, it got really cold and stiff as soon as I got it on my hair and I was panicked that it wouldn&#x27;t work due to the cold. (Plus, it&#x27;s January!) Then I cranked up the heat and sat on a vent for the remaining 18 minutes. BTW, while it doesn&#x27;t smell good by any means, the bad odor is waaay overstated by many people&#x27;s reviews.     I rinsed and rinsed (this is the worst part)... I even ran out of hot water. Immediately, soaking wet, I could tell a ton of color was gone. I put a good conditioner on my hair and sat around for another 20 minutes. It does make your hair dry, but honestly a 30-minute shower would do that anyway. (Not to mentioned all the harsh washing I&#x27;d done for 3 days prior.) In fact, I swear my skin is drier than my hair right now. I&#x27;ll deep condition a couple more times and I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.    RESULTS:  I am back to blond! Yay! It&#x27;s a bit more brassy or strawberry blond than I started with before this whole mess. But, I am delighted beyond words that the dark brown, orange is gone! I&#x27;ll give my hair a break for a week and then throw some ash blond color in it. Here&#x27;s a really interesting thing though... I expected it to strip the brown out and take me back to blond with some darker roots. But, I have no roots at all?! Weird...    Go for it and good luck!</li>
    <li> Title says it all. If you ADDED pigment to your hair, with the right application and shampoo/rinse dedication, color oops gets rid of almost all the color.&lt;br /&gt;I went from a somewhat faded auburn (almost) back to my natural light blonde color. It is still a little reddish (like a slight strawberry blonde), but I am probably the only one that notices.</li>
    <li> I had blonde hair with natural high lights and low lights and it was pretty but then I decided to day it burgundy. After two months of burgundy hair, I wanted to go back to my pretty blonde hair from before so I bought two boxes of this (if you need two boxes of hair dye, you need two boxes of this) and let it do its magic. I read that the more you wash and rise your hair the better it will work so I washed my hair a total of four times and rinsed it until the water in my shower went cold. As I was washing it, I looked down and saw that my hair (or at least the ends of it) looked like it used to, so I was hopeful. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t think about the fact that burgundy is a very rich and pigmented color, so once I dried my hair it was orange. I was pissed at first but now its starting to grow on me a bit. It isn&#x27;t a terrible color and it has some nice burgundy undertones, but just be warned that sometimes out didn&#x27;t get rid of ALL the color</li>
    <li> I got this because I used a dark brown dye that made my hair look muddy and inky colored. I dye my hair a lot and honestly can&#x27;t even remember what exactly the base color looks like!  Just used color oops today and am amazed at how well it worked. The smell is way over analyzed by other reviewers...it pretty much smells like a perm and if u&#x27;re a girl like me who frequently colors, etc. It&#x27;s no more obnoxious than any other dye/chemical smells. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how runny it is-it makes it hard to apply and I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting it through enough. But I guess I did cause my hair (for the first time in a long time) is evenly light brown colored. I shampooed with prell cause it&#x27;s clarifying, rinsed for 5 min, shampooed again, rinsed for 20 min. Yes it sux and is really annoying doing it for that long but it&#x27;s necessary! In fact I rinsed for so long that I ran out of hot water so I didn&#x27;t condition yet-gonna wait a little later till I have hot water again! Then I&#x27;ll probably deep condition for 20 min. I got a box of dye with it but the color isn&#x27;t bad so I don&#x27;t feel the rush to color for now!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair dark brown from blonde. Disaster. It wasn&#x27;t even, the color was very blotchy. So, i tried coloropps. The first time it definitely lighten the shade, but it turned it reddish. The second box of color opps did nothing. Im going to my salon today. Dont waste your money on color oops!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair black for 3 years. I finally decided I wanted a change. This product did not come with a paper instruction manual inside... which was aggravating. Thankfully people wrote detailed steps on here.   I followed all the directions. I did a strand test... nothing happened after 20 minutes. So i left it in for twenty five minutes. I spent 45 minutes in the shower rinsing and shampooing so the results were in no way tainted by my ignorance. My hair lightened maybe half a shade all over. Though in the spots where the was lighter amount of dye applied it did take it out, no problem. The issue is that much of my hair has been dyed black upwards of twelve times. So the results are understandable. Good product, will buy again until it lightens my hair.</li>
    <li> I recently tried a new hair color that looked great on the box but the result in my hair was... OOPS! My hair was so red it nearly glowed in the dark. Needless to say I took a lot of ribbing at work until a co-worker told me about this product.     I&#x27;m a skeptic generally but desperate times had me heading to the drugstore right away. I followed the directions, paying particular attention to the notes about temperature, and 20 minutes later I had a perfectly normal color again. This product is VERY easy to use, it wasn&#x27;t harsh on my skin, and other than normal dryness from having to wash my hair twice it did not seem damaging in the least. It also didn&#x27;t smell terrible or leave residual aromas.     I&#x27;ve bought a second box to keep around the house. Hey, you never know!</li>
    <li> So just to give you a little background on me, I am naturally super blonde. I decided to dye my hair dark, (level 4 to be exact, black brown) and although it looked great with my blue eyes, the white roots peeking though was annoying so I decided my hair had enough and I&#x27;d go back to my natural. I started by going back to my professional hair dresser and he started lightening me up by doing heavy highlights. Well damaged bleached highlights and $200 dollars later and my hair looking like a Zebra, (I had platinum blonde highlights with black/brownish hair) My hair lightens really easy because my base is so blonde. I luck out that my hair doesn&#x27;t go orange because my base is just that light. However I still hated my new striped locks, I started doing research on how to lighten this black brown out of my hair. I did the Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo which did help lighten the base (the PH in this shampoo helps wash out permanent hair dye) I then came across Color Oops. I was super scared, I have NEVER done my hair at home, but I was afraid of spending $100&#x27;s more and bleaching to lighten my locks back up. So I did it, followed the directions to the tee, (my hair had been highlighted twice in the last 2 weeks) And prayed it wouldn&#x27;t break off. 20 stinky min later (this product has sulfur in it so yes it smells like sulfur) I go in the shower and started rinsing rinsing rinsing. I didn&#x27;t notice any color difference in the processing time but once I hopped in the shower I saw the black just rinse out!!!! My Highlights looked fine, but my base when from a black brown to a carmel blonde!!! I then purple shampooed to tone and did a cuticle repair treatment and TADA! I have beautiful highlighted carmel blonde hair. It&#x27;s Golden but not brassy. It&#x27;s not my natural color but at least now I look like a carmel blonde with highlights and not a black hair with highlights (zebra to be exact) Bottom line is THIS STUFF WORKS!! I am going to give my hair a break and enjoy my new carmel blonde,and when my roots start peeking though again I am going to color oops again and hope it take more of the dye out (instead of bleaching) It says you can use the product up to 3 times. My hair had been dyed darker for 6 months so I didn&#x27;t expect it to rinse all the dye out, but I was still blown away at the results. This will dry your hair out a, so condition condition condition! But it was no where near as damaging as the bleach. I loved the product so much that I will be using it again in hopes to eventually bring my blonde back.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to add a note to all these helpful reviews.  I color my hair a medium brown mainly to cover the gray.  I used the new Nice and Easy Color Blend Foam thinking that the product sounded easier to use than the traditional color applications I had been using (it was easier, but pretty messy).  The foam product turned my hair very dark brown, really almost black.  I used Oops and it reverted my hair to it&#x27;s natural medium brown color and did not leave my roots gray as I had feared.  Thought I would have to re-color my hair a light brown to cover the gray roots, but after using the Oops product, my roots were still brown, not gray.</li>
    <li> My daughter dyed her hair darkest brown (looked black!). She naturally has light brown hair but had highlights and wanted to cover them. Needless to say the almost black color she used was NOT what she wanted. After a few months she decided to try and strip the color out using Color Oops. It worked great! The black came right out, and now her hair is a beautiful medium brown with soft copper highlights. It is not her natural color, but is far better than the black and is still a very pretty color. I would recommend Color Oops to anyone looking to get rid of a darker color. The smell is pretty bad, but so is bleach if you go that route.</li>
    <li> I have light brown hair that I dyed a darker brown. It ended up black. This product did not do what it said it would, even after two applications, two boxes each application. Also, it has a horrible smell, like an old style perm. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Im not sure if so many people wrote good reviews because they posted it right after using or not but here&#x27;s my story.. my hair is naturally a dirty blonde but I&#x27;ve been dieing my hair a whiter blonde since i was about 14 (21 now). I wanted a change from the blonde hair and decided to die my hair dark red, and have been dieing it that color for probably 5 months now. Well it is now summer and i was sick of the dark red and wanted my blonde hair back, so i was looking on all different websites trying to find what I should put in my hair. Most websites said bleach and i didnt want to resort to that, so i went on Amazon and found color oops. Most of the reviews were pretty good so i thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Anyway i used 2 bottles of this stuff in my hair and my hair is to my shoulders. The smell is horrible just like everyone else was saying. It says to keep it in for 20 minutes and watch what color your hair is turning so you dont keep it in too long. Well by 20 minutes it had just started to change. I ended up having it in for 45 minutes. Then i went and scrubbed my hair in the shower for 30 mins.(what fun that was) I could just feel how dry my hair was becoming while i was in the shower. I couldn&#x27;t even get my fingers threw my hair and ended up using a half a bottle of conditioner but after doing that my hair wasn&#x27;t so dry. When i came out of the shower and dried my hair I was amazed that this stuff actually worked somewhat. My hair was a golden blondeish kind of yellowish though, but i figured o well atleast this stuff did something about the dark red. Well i wake up this morning and look in the mirror and my hair is a redish orange now!! It changed color and it seems like my red is coming back except now my hair is pretty orange uhhhh! I&#x27;m going to try to die it some type of blonde color and I hope it will fix it a bit. I never thought dieing my hair dark red would mean i could never die it blonde again! Never will I do that again, but anyway it seems like aftera day or two your hair just keeps changing colors! uhhhhh not to happy especially since 2 bottles cost me 28 bucks.... :/</li>
    <li> Not only did this product fail to remove any hair color, it actually added a brassy tint to the color I have!  I am going to try to get my money back from the company.  Don&#x27;t get ripped off like I did.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t repeat everything every one else said about following the directions to the letter and how it only works if you went darker when you colored, not lighter -- all VERY true!!!  I will tell you that my hair is very fine, I&#x27;m a natural brunette, but have been coloring my hair for years.  My natural color is very dark, but I had colored it a few months ago with a red-brown that I really liked.  Like all reds, it faded A LOT and was looking kind of orangy to me, PLUS I had my dark roots coming in and some wispy grays around the temples.  Yeah, I know, YUK!  I had to do something, so I colored with Garnier Fructis dark mahogany brown.  Worked great, covered the gray, left my hair shiny, etc., BUT I had left it in the full 30 mins because the grays I have a resistant to color and my hair turned an extremely dark brown, almost black.  UGH.  I went to work for two days like that and I hated how it looked in general and it looked even worse in the fluorescent lights at work.  Made me look really old and I&#x27;m definitely not old.  OY.  I figured I had nothing to loose, so I hauled over to the CVS and found OOPS Extra Strength.  I stood in the CVS and read about a hundred reviews online on my phone while i debated if I wanted to try it.  I am SO glad that I did!  I did the strand test and determined that I would only need to leave it on for ten minutes to get the lightness I wanted.  Like I said, my hair is very fine and since it takes color easily, I wasn&#x27;t surprised that the color came out easily too.  By the time I finished putting it on, I had nine minutes left and then washed with Suave Clarifying Shampoo, rinsed, washed, rinsed, washed and then conditioned.  Twenty minutes of rinsing each time and 20 mins of conditioner.  I was prepared to recolor after I finished, but I really like the resulting color.  Oddly enough, it&#x27;s similar to how it looked before I colored it dark but I have no dark roots and no gray at the temple.  SWEET!  I love it!  My hair still feels healthy and I don&#x27;t need to color.  Best product ever!</li>
    <li> Smells horrible BUT it takes the color out of your hair. Only permanent color. It will not take out the semi or demi permanent color. I gave it 5 stars because it did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Used it many times. It works. Does it stink like rotten eggs/sulfur? Yes. Does it smell after washing/rinsing a few times? Yes. Does it go away eventually? Yes. Do you want the color gone or not? Smell is a small price to pay for the result. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Will not work on dark hair. I used this product today, worst mistake ever. I did everything right. Applied it, sat in a warm room, I even blow dried it! Then I rinsed it forever, I think I probably washed my hair about 5 times! And I combed it let it air dry and nothing! My hair is so thin now with how much hair fell out! Not to mention it smells like I just washed my hair with rotten eggs! Absolutely terrible product. I got so much stuff to do my hair after, now I might as well throw everything in the trash now! I&#x27;m so frustrated. My hair was so healthy before I started, and now it Feels like hay! Such a terrible idea. I wish I could receive my money back.</li>
    <li> The product claims to remove only the hair color and bring you back to your natural color.  This is not true.  It lightens your hair (including your own natural hair color) to an orange/gold color.  Has a VERY STRONG smell.  I have dark brown hair with some gray. Wanted to cover the grey and then wanted to remove the one coat of fresh color.  This product left me regreting using it.</li>
    <li> So my natural hair is a medium brown, but decided to be like the teenager I am, and I dyed my hair black.I loved the color, but it was just not working with my skin tone. I then bought some Feria hair dye for dark hair, but it barely lightened my hair. I had contemplated on bleaching highlights in my hair, to lighten it up a bit, but then chose Color Oops. I did a strand test, and it really looked like I had finally found a product that would lighten my hair, with less damaging affects. Only thing was that the smell was extremely nauseating. I had to breathe through only my mouth while applying the product so i would not throw up; it was that treacherous. I spent the 20 minutes running outside, (it was a hot day, so I still was able to stay in warm air) just to escape the smell. Once the 20 mins were up, i washed out the Color Oops, and for sure the black hair was gone. I was amazed, and honestly, the color I now had, I kind of liked. It wasn&#x27;t too brassy, and it was a nice light brown/ dark blonde. But the next morning, after I took a shower, I went to go do my hair, and the color had turned out to be dark brown. The product had not improved anything, AND the smell was still there! I had a concert this day, and once Sean Kingston stepped on stage, everyone began jumping, and this girl behind me in the crowd said \\&quot;Woah someone needs to take a shower, it smells gross!\\&quot; It&#x27;s now been a few days since using Color Oops and my hair still smells disgusting, and I&#x27;m redying my hair; but of course a lighter shade than the one I want. For anyone using this product, it will lighten your hair, I&#x27;m not sure how much, but there will definitely be a difference. Be prepared for the smell, and the damage is nothing a good conditioner can&#x27;t fix. Good Luck.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I used Loreal&#x27;s new Healthy Look Cr&amp;egrave;me Gloss in Black Gloss.  The package says it&#x27;s not permanent hair color and will wash out after 28 shampoos.  I&#x27;m normally a red head and thought black would be fun for a month.  And it was fun for that month.  But by week 8 I was ready to have my natural color back.  I tried everything -dish soap, ivory soap, baking soda, vitamin c tablets, vinegar, coconut oil, praying to the hair gods.  Nothing worked, it wouldn&#x27;t even lighten it.  Finally after 5 months I found Color Oops Hair Color Remover.  My hair is still not back to normal, but it&#x27;s 85% there.  I can live with that.  Now to figure out what to do with the other package of Healthy Look Cr&amp;egrave;me Gloss....</li>
    <li> As someone who loves to try new colors and experiment with her hair but also wears clip-in extensions, it has been somewhat frustrating over the years when the color I use on my own hair does not translate the same way into my remy hair extensions. I wish I had found this product sooner!!!!! I have been varying shades of red for a few years now and always have to dye blonde extensions to get the desired color - after receiving a brand new pack in the mail this morning I decided to use the same shade to color them that I use on my own hair (happens to be Wella Titian Red Blonde). I&#x27;m sure there are chemical processes the extensions go through before they arrive at my door that may alter the way color picks up, but they turned almost purple! After using Color Oops it&#x27;s like it never happened at all. No noticeable damage to the strands either! I definitely have to go back to the drawing board on what to use on them next but at least I got to basically hit &amp;#34;undo&amp;#34; on my mess up today!!! Wizardry!!!!</li>
    <li> My daughter used blue dye on a streak of hair for the summer...she has dark blond hair and didn&#x27;t bleach it before putting in color..now for school she is not allowed colorful hair..So we tried this and it didn&#x27;t work after 2 applications...    Of course it was the last line in directions inside of box that said it wouldn&#x27;t do it...but this is after spending $9 for it and not being able to return the box after it was opened.   It should specifically state it on the outside of the box!    Very dissappointed at waste of money!</li>
    <li> Background:  I have natural med. brown hair that was bleached blonde by my stylist over several months with heavy foils and it was costing a fortune.  My hair was fried.  I have chin length bob with bangs and I like short hair, and would even go shorter with a cute asymetrical bob when my hair is the right color.  I can pull it off well, looks great short and I&#x27;m a 37 year old mommy of one boy--and my \\&quot;thing\\&quot; is to be put together well, head to toe.  I care about my appearance, but yes I am willing to have a great short hairstyle.  Anyways, after all of the foiling my hair turned gummy and I couldn&#x27;t even comb it!  I researced and learned in order to go to a darker shade you must go in reverse up the color spectrum.  Blonde, orange, red, brown.  So, I filled my hair with \\&quot;Colorful Protein Filler\\&quot; --amazing product, found here and at Sally&#x27;s.  Then I used a level 7RB permenant Goldwell color.  I did a 7K (copper) as well over the summer and rocked the red hair for several months.  Recently, I covered the red with Goldwell 4MB which is a dark, medium brown-permenant color.  It&#x27;s super dar, and the dried ends of my hair look so oversaturated with color, there is very little shine.  Lately I&#x27;ve been using Matrix 5MM (darkish-brown Mocha) in a Demi-permenant.  I&#x27;ve done this three times.  My hair is getting much healthier!!!  However, it is really too dark, it&#x27;s almost black and I have very fair skin and hazel eyes.  I&#x27;m used to having blonde in my hair or at the very least strawberry blonde highlights.  Never had hair this extreme, it&#x27;s too harsh.  SOOOO, with that all being said, SHOULD I USE THIS PRODUCT TO REMOVE the color in my hair, and do you think it will?  Most importantly, seeing as my hair is basically ALL bleached under the dark color, I know that the results will be bright yellow or orange.  However, will this DESTROY my hair?  I&#x27;m very unhappy with the dark hair, and I cannot spend the money to go to the salon for a full head of highlights.  (It would cost at least $200 plus the upkeep). If this does dryout my hair somewhat, I am willing to cut it into a shorter bob to freshen it up, but only if it&#x27;s a pretty color like strawberry blonde or golden or dark golden.  Will not go short AND have dark hair!  HELP???at least $200 plus the upkeep). If this does dryout my hair somewhat, I am willing to cut it into a shorter bob to freshen it up, but only if it&#x27;s a pretty color like strawberry blonde or golden or dark golden.  Will not go short AND have dark hair!  HELP???</li>
    <li> My hair was light ash brown and then I dye it with black!!! And my boyfriend hate that black hair....  So I end up using this and it work perfectly!!! Removed all the black dye in my hair... But yea it will damage your hair...</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally dark blonde, but I had colored it pale blonde.  I then chose a &#x27;dark blonde&#x27; shade that turned it chocolate brown, which didn&#x27;t look good on me.&lt;br /&gt;I was nervous about trying this product, but it performed beautifully for me.  It resulted in a strawberry blonde, which I&#x27;ll keep for now.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well. I got extra strength to remove a light red. It Lightened it a bit. Left a terrible smell on my hair when it gets wet for several days after.</li>
    <li> i dyed my hair black a few months ago, ive been dying my hair dark brown for a few years. i was tired of the black so i bought color oops and i used two boxes and it only lightened my roots. i bout the loreal hair color remover and it worked right away</li>
    <li> I just used the color oops about an hour ago. I dyed my hair from my natural blonde (with highlights) to dark brown. I was naive and thought that if I used a semi-permanent color that it would rinse out. Halloween is coming up and I am going to be Alice in wonderland. so i need to be blonde again. The color had only been in 2 weeks and i was sure that the dye had stained my hair. The color oops only made my hair a lighter shade of brown. My hair doesnt feel too dry or damaged, it kind of just feels like i blew it dry and doesnt have any hydrating product on it. Anyways, i am going to try again to remove the color, this time a Loreal product.</li>
    <li> This lightened my dark brown almost black hair at least three shades and made natural blonde highlights that framed my face. I would order this again if an at-home hair color I needed to mend. Just be warned: It&#x27;s got quite a pungent smell so plug your nose if you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to handle it well.</li>
    <li> I used two of these today, did everything I was supposed to. I read each step beforehand and was prepared, and the outcome is that this product exposed my grey hair and stripped the color from my top part of my head , while leaving the bottom half excactely like it was before; dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sucks. What happened here? I even used the 15 minute long rinse, the protein filler, etc. and this is the result? I wanted to go from dark brown to light brown. My hair is medium lenght.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know why this happened?</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant in purchasing this product due to some poor reviews, but then - in reading the accompanying label, I figured that people with issues completely ignored the instructions! Now, although the product states to remove the most recent application of dye (I dye my hair copper red, starting with bleached hair), it removed mostly all color and left me strawberry blonde - but, this only speaks to the quality of the dye used, not Color Oops!!&lt;br /&gt;This thing is so very easy to apply (basically, you put it on just you would do with a color shampoo, just make sure your hair is well saturated!); the smell is not all that intense (it smells sulphury only not that strong) unless you stick your nose in the bottle...&lt;br /&gt;The most important is, my hair was silky and healthy after rinsing it out - I will never use bleach in my life again!!! My natural roots were left intact - I definitely recommend Color Oops to everyone - just: READ &amp; FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!! Cheers, and happy dyeing!!</li>
    <li> Did exactly what it said. I had burgundy red hair and it stripped it all out, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it returned my hair to my original color.</li>
    <li> My Experience With OOps Hair Color Removal Has Been Nothing But Positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Thought I Wanted To Go Back To My Natural Hair Color (Dirty Blonde) And Had Let My Hair Grow Out Alot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Doing So. The Hair Stylist Used A Color With Ash In It. Ash Has Never Been A Good Experience For Me,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I Thought The Hair Stylist New What She Was Doing, And I Did Not Disagree Or Object. Well What I Ended Up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Was A Muddy Looking Color With A Green Hue, Ugh  :(  .  I Tried To  Wait It Out, With Hopes That I Would&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get Use To The Color , As I Am Use To Being Lighter, And I Did Not Want To Over React. I Did Continue To Wash My&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Multiple Times &amp;  Condition, In Hopes That It Would Fade Quicker. I Just Felt Ugly, And Could Not Stand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Look At My Hair. Then I Went On Line To Seek Help In Regards To Getting This Color Out Of My Hair.  Reading Several&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Articles On Hair Color Removal.  Well I Just Got Darn Lucky When I Discovered OOps.  I Read Several Reviews On The Hair Color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal OOps  (Some Good &amp;  And Some Bad  ).  And I Decided To Give It A Try.....Yeah!  I Used Two Boxes ( $ 9.99 Each On Sale)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Hair Is Thick , Curly, And To My Shoulders.  Started At The Bottom Of My Hair, And Worked My Way To The Top. Left On For 20&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minutes , Rinsed With Warm Water For 25 Minutes ( Harder To Do Then One Might Think). Shampoo Then Rinsed For Another 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Put Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask By Neutrogena On With A Cap For 45 Minutes. Then I Rinsed It Out And Sprayed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organix coconut oil (weightless Hydrating oil mist). WahhhLahhh!!!  My Hair Looks Great.... No Damage, The Green Is Gone, Color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Very Nice. I Don&#x27;t Hope To Have To Use This Product Again, But If I Have A Hair Color Mishap Again, I Do No What To Do Next&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time. And Like I Said, My Hair Texture Is Thick, Curly, Shoulder Length, Very Resistant.  I Cant SayEnough About This Product, Love It, Love It, Love It.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You From Florida!!</li>
    <li> This really,really works! I have light auburn hair and colored it over a month ago and it went wrong.It went eggplant color.At first it looked kinda cool,then started to fade and looked really bad.I used Oops Extra strength tonight and Im back to my natural red,yippee! Never thought I would be so happy to see my regular old color.And the large amount of money saved from not having to go to the hairdresser.  And the smell is no worse than a perm.Try it,it works!</li>
    <li> Ok...I&#x27;ve been every color under the sun.  My natural color is dark blonde.  But i&#x27;ve been highlighting it for 20 years and in between highlights, I go dark.  I colored my hair over the weekend to a dark auburn.  Even though it was a beautiful color, it doesn&#x27;t look good...too dark!!!!  So I tried the Color Oops and followed the directions to the letter.  By the time I finished all the rinsing, my water was COLD.  When I conditioned and dried my hair, it left the most beautiful strawberry blonde color.  I am not going to do another all over color as I don&#x27;t need it.  I am AMAZED.  It didn&#x27;t take me back to natural because I had highlights, but it DID remove the dark red.  I am sooooo impressed.  I think next week, I will add some highlights just to give some two tone to my hair, but overall IT DOES WORK!!!!</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!! I used this product twice on my hair to get the dark brown out and it turned my hair into this wierd orange and then the COLOR RETURNED and it freaking STINKS I have to cover my nose when I go into my bathroom now because it smells like rotten eggs from this treatment. I&#x27;ve been lathering my hair in hair milk to get rid of the smell and it&#x27;s working okay but I can still smell this horrible rotten egg smell. It smells like Satan just took a massive dump inside my bathroom. It&#x27;s a gross product that DOESN&#x27;T WORK. Save your money and your time! I would give this 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> It works pefrectly!  It did leave my hair a little lighter than it naturally is and because I had a very stubborn red I left the product on longer which left it a little brassy.  The brassy color washed out after about a week.</li>
    <li> It worked, the bad thing  was the smell.</li>
    <li> I am revising my original review, which I wrote 36 hours after using Color Oops and following the instructions to the letter.  Color Oops did strip away a lot of color, and, like many others, my hair darkened back up considerably within 24-36 hours after use.  At the time I wrote my review, I thought it was reverting completely; however, my hair never returned to the near-black color it was before I used the product.  I will say that 24 hours after using Color Oops, I did wash my hair again, lathering twice with clarifying shampoo, once with a color deposit shampoo (to add a little warmth), and deep conditioning for an hour.  Maybe that helped.  In any case, Color Oops did not return my hair to where it was before the unfortunate salon color incident (essentially black), but it did strip away enough of the unfortunate color to where I am now quite satisfied with the resulting dark ash brown.  I would definitely recommend the product.  A cautionary note:  your hair will look different 24 hours after using Color Oops than it does one hour after using Color Oops.  So, be patient and wait for the end result before making any hasty decisions about re-coloring, or any conclusions about your hair color.  Also, regarding the odor: the smell did not linger on my hair once I had conditioned it and used my normal styling products.  However, the smell did linger in my bathroom for several days!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Color Oops HR CLR remover xtra and let me tell you this product is a waste of money. It claims to bring your hair back to its natural color. Let me tell you this it for one does not and it didnt even strip the color out of my hair. I have black on the bottom half of my head and I wanted to get it out to make my hair all one color. It says leave it on for 15 mins and the color will come out. I had it on my head for an hour and it did not touch the color. Dont waste your money people.</li>
    <li> Well, I researched this product for weeks and read tons of reviews before I tried it. now it&#x27;s my turn for a review!&lt;br /&gt; My hair is naturally a light ash brown to a dark ash blonde, but I get bored and color it a lot...Since last year it started lemon blonde, then I turned it into a mink style with black, then I payed a salon to turn it back to my natural, after a few months I got bored and went to the salon and got talked into a burgundy red base with crimson red and blonde highlights! It looked great for a while, but then my roots grew out. I didn&#x27;t want to pay anymore money to get it done again so I tried Color Oops....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all the reviews it said that it was very runny, it was, but it wasn&#x27;t THAT bad, definitely workable. My hair almost absorbed it so it didn&#x27;t drip as bad as I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also said it was very smelly...and it is pretty bad. When you&#x27;re applying it, it&#x27;s not that strong, but when it&#x27;s left in and the day following it really does smell like rotten eggs, but not in a complete nauseating way, you kinda get used to it after a while. I do advise keeping the vent on when applying and rinsing though, and maybe opening a few windows in the house for the first day. I didn&#x27;t notice it after a while, but my boyfriend did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse, rinse, and re rinse. That how this works. The more you rinse the better it works (the box advises for 20 min, I only did for 15, but stick it out and go the whole 9 yards)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results....Keep in mind that I was going from deep burgundy red with bold red and blonde highlights, one of the hardest colors to get rid of...(I accidentally left Color oops on a little too long, but I don&#x27;t think it affected the results and my hair didn&#x27;t fall out, so that&#x27;s a minor detail) After I rinsed and dried I was left with a golden blonde with a strawberry tint to it, and the blonde highlights just got brighter. The bottom was a bit darker than the rest so make sure you apply evenly and everywhere. The color I was left with (if the bottom had come out the same as the rest) really wasn&#x27;t a bad color by itself, all the dark red was gone but I DID still have some red tint to it where the crimson highlights were. I waited a bit and used what I had left over of the color opps again, enough to get all of it, but the result didn&#x27;t change at all. If anything it just blended the colors together a little. I don&#x27;t believe my hair was damaged at all by the product, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I applied anything to it so it&#x27;s a lot healthier than getting it stripped or bleaching it and for the MOST part it got the dark red out, which is what I wanted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited one day before I recolored, the new color is Ash Blonde from l&#x27;oreal paris. I think 8A. I got a \\&quot;cooler\\&quot; shade because it minimizes red tones... BUT I STILL have some strawberry tones on the top after dying that is uneven. I wanted the red tone completely gone, so I wish I would have gone to a brown or a platinum blonde instead to mask it better. So, my advice here is to be careful with what you choose to color it afterwords. If you still have the difficult-to-remove tones like red or black AFTER you use color opps, plan accordingly when redyeing. Also, you can still smell the color opps even after you redye, so there&#x27;s no getting rid of it that easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all-in-all I&#x27;m glad I used it. I didn&#x27;t have to pay a crazy amount of money, and it did better than I thought it would, especially for what it had to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEFORE color opps:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER Color opps AND redying:&lt;br /&gt;[...]if the bottom had come out the same as the rest) really wasn&#x27;t a bad color by itself, all the dark red was gone but I DID still have some red tint to it where the crimson highlights were. I waited a bit and used what I had left over of the color opps again, enough to get all of it, but the result didn&#x27;t change at all. If anything it just blended the colors together a little. I don&#x27;t believe my hair was damaged at all by the product, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I applied anything to it so it&#x27;s a lot healthier than getting it stripped or bleaching it and for the MOST part it got the dark red out, which is what I wanted...

    <li> I have naturally dark, almost black hair and for the past few years have been coloring it reddish brown with henna. I wanted a matte, all-over, dramatic color and decided to color my hair completely black. I liked it, but it just didn&#x27;t really work on me. It looked too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Color Oops and followed the directions. I only rinsed for just the minimum 20 minutes. Perhaps if I had rinsed longer, more of the black would have come out, but I was impatient. My hair did not return to my previous color, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to. It turned into a dark but warm brown. My hair now has a noticeable coppery/red tone to it. I actually like it a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, somehow it made my hair incredibly soft. Before even coloring my hair, it was very strawlike and my ends were fried. After using this product, my hair is very soft and my ends look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have the expectation that using this product will make it look like you never colored in the first place, but it will get you close.</li>
    <li> This worked like a charm. Just follow the directions by the letter. I had reddish hair that wouldn&#x27;t fade out on my blonde, so I used this to get the 8+ month dye out. No issues. The smell bothered my husband, but not me. Worth it for the hair correction. Way cheaper than going to a salon.</li>
    <li> My teen daughter insisted on going down the dye path, in spite of the fact that she had long, thick, milk chocolate colored hair that had red highlights when the sun hit it. I said no way, she said yes way, guess who won (she only lets me win an argument about every 30 days, just to bolster my esteem and foster the pretense that I&#x27;m in charge).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  She started out with very light brownish/blondish highlights. I hated the way they looked, she liked them, she kept them for about a year. She got tired of them, and got darker highlights, which looked more natural, but her hair wasn&#x27;t as thick and soft anymore, even with sulfate free shampoos and once weekly deep conditioning. Dying is HARD on your hair; imo it&#x27;s better for your hair and less likely to end in weeping and drama if you go the non-permanent route, with color that washes out in 6-10 washes (there is another semi permanent color that washes out in 28 washes, it&#x27;s a little rougher on your hair and the color stays in longer than 28, at least it did for me, and my daughter). My other daughter gets a kind of &#x27;glaze&#x27; of color over her hair when she goes to the salon; it looks really beautiful and natural. It washes out in two/three days, but it&#x27;s a safe way to experiment with color. We are all about drama free experimenting in a house of two teen girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Back to our story: daughter now has darker highlights for six months, gets tired of them, and wants all over color that is a bit darker than her dark highlights. (I did the coloring myself...I&#x27;ve paid significant amounts of money for terrible dye jobs, for color that washed out in the salon sink, for traumatically bad shades, i.e. hair that turned purple when it was supposed to be auburn. I don&#x27;t pay for color anymore. If your colorist is amazing, count yourself among the blessed and be sure to tip them well. They are few and far between, in my experience, even at reputable salons). In spite of using the washes-out-in-28-washes semi-permanent dye of medium brown, her color came out almost black. It looked like it was coated with shoe polish, it absorbed light like a black hole, it didn&#x27;t even look edgy or goth, it just looked gawdawful. Cue rounds of weeping and door slamming and bitter recriminations (I know, I know, it&#x27;s not good for kids to see their mothers like that, but, it was just so, sob, UGLY ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  While my daughter cried herself to sleep, I went online and researched dye lightening/reversal/howcanigetvaliumwithoutaprescription options. It became apparent there are so many people online, RIGHT NOW, looking up ways to fix their overly dark awful dye job (some home, some from salons). The message boards are full of desperate, horrified people, of all ages and genders, trying to fix their hair. There are many &#x27;cures&#x27;, from the ridiculous (pouring diluted clorox bleach on hair) to helpful (wash w/drops of Dawn dish soap mixed with Prell shampoo, rinse with hottest poss. water, condition, repeat for a month). I don&#x27;t know why it took me four hours to find Color Oops, but it did, and by this time I was convinced there were no quick fixes, just tedious, somewhat useful fading techniques. That being said, however, C.O. seemed unusual enough that I began to wade through about 500 reviews on Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Following the instructions is EVERYTHING with this product (I know, right? Me? Following instructions to a T? But I&#x27;m an American! I have instruction rights!) Also, it only works with hair that has gone darker, not hair that has been lightened. Be prepared to spend some quality time counting tiles in your shower; the rinsing time is critically important. The infamous smell isn&#x27;t a problem, because, when you (or, say, your teen) have a wretched dye job and you are wailing \\&quot;I&#x27;ll do anything, ANYTHING to fix this, I can&#x27;t live with this!\\&quot;, a temporary sulfuric, rotten egg-type smell is a small price to pay. The smell doesn&#x27;t last past a day, anyway. You can always put a little perfume on to distract your nose (which fragrance notes work well with eau d&#x27;egg rot? There&#x27;s gotta be something). Also extremely important: the test strand. I cut about twenty hairs for a tiny but thick enough strand to observe results. I left the solution on for the instructed 20 min, and after rinsing, it seemed too light for her original hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  For the actual process, I used a timer on my cell, which was more helpful to me than setting an alarm, because I knew precisely how much time had passed. We left the solution on for 13 minutes (I had intended to have her start rinsing at the 10 minute mark, considering how light the test strand went after 20 min, but it ended up being 13 minutes because I had a cooking interruption). She rinsed with warm, not hot, water because we didn&#x27;t want the heater to run out too quickly, shampooed for 5 minutes, rinsed for 20, shampooed again for 5, rinsed for 20, shampooed a third time, rinsed for ten, and then got out of the shower. The odor was mostly gone by this time, and in point of fact, the smell wasn&#x27;t as much an issue as the marathon rinsing. It really seemed endless. She had the radio on to help with the tedium, but it was a good thing we used the cell timer, as we both kept saying \\&quot;Oh surely it&#x27;s been time enough\\&quot;, and discovered to our chagrin that it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I didn&#x27;t have her use conditioner, as I had a packet of olive oil/orange oil deep conditioning mask for her to sleep in, under a shower cap (I use it all the time, it&#x27;s lovely. $1.50 for single use packet at Walgreens). Her hair, even wet, looked almost exactly like it did back before she started ever dying it. I was amazed. I just couldn&#x27;t believe such a remarkable transformation. The next morning, she rinsed off the mask, used a tiny drop of BioSilk on the ends, and blew it out with the dryer. Her hair was BEAUTIFUL. It once again looks like milk chocolate with those reddish hues when the sun hits it.  A week and two shampoos later, it&#x27;s still beautiful. She has only been blowing out her bangs, the rest she lets dry overnight, just to baby the hair a bit. I&#x27;ve read reviews about successful color reversals, but with a lot of damage, to the point where they question if they should have just let the hair fade with other timely techniques. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because she has only been dying her hair for a few years, but it&#x27;s not terribly damaged. A little bit, yes, but not enough to merit concern. Almost certainly her hair would be more damaged if we had dyed again after the C.O. to achieve her desired shade, but we lucked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I love this product. If I had known of it when I was younger, I could have avoided a lot of my own hair drama. If possible, I&#x27;d like to implore the makers of C.O. to branch out: Marriage Oops, I Ate The Whole Box Of Fudge When My Period Started Oops, I Looked Away For Two Seconds To Snarl At My Kids And Nailed The Bumper Of The Mercedes In Front Of Me Whose Driver Turned Out To Be A Lawyer Oops. There&#x27;s an untapped market here, I&#x27;m sure of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This product is cheap, simple to use, and most importantly, I am now the mother of a Happy Teen With Good Hair.

    <li> I have light brown hair, and after a salon \\&quot;accident\\&quot;it ended up quite a bit darker than intended.  Well, to make a long story short, I tried to \\&quot;undo\\&quot; what they had done, and it didn&#x27;t work out as well as I had intended.  I ended up in a salon for 4 1/2 hours when I came back to the States, trying the \\&quot;right way\\&quot; to get the color out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because the salon also had a lot of trouble getting the dye out too-so it might have just been the dye that was the problem, but I seriously doubt it.</li>
    <li> after i dyed my hair a terrible red color, i went to the Salon, and they had told me that red was one of the most difficult colors to get out of my hair. But i tried Color Oops and all the ugly red dissapeared! only thing is that the blonde and pink and little brown i had in my hair from previous Dyes were back. Im assuming Color Oops doesnt work well on Bleached hair that was colored after, so i dont recommend this product if youre trying to get a color that you bleached first out of your hair. Also, if smells really gross and leaves an after smell in your hair until 2 or 3 washes later, ad it also leaves a smell in your bathroom. other than that, i am very pleased (:</li>
    <li> my hair is dark brown/black, the first time i tried this product It didnt change the color at all and I thought that maybe because my hair is so dark i need to do it twice... No that just fried my ends it didn&#x27;t change the color at all for me this product was just a wast of money and now I have to repair my hair before I do anything with it.</li>
    <li> i was between trying this and just bleaching my hair to get the dark colors out of my hair.  this product left my hair bright yellow at the roots and brown at the ends.  i had to buy two shades of dye to try to get my hair match in color again...what a nightmare.  plus it left me with split ends and really dry hair...next time ill just use the bleach and be done with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased one box because of the short length of my hair, I wanted to remove dark brown and change hair color to dark blonde. I had blonde highlights in my hair as well and just wanted to have one color all over. All the dark brown came out,and I re-colored the next day. My hair looks great again and I don&#x27;t feel like a clown anymore.</li>
    <li> I am 100% satisfied with this product.  A few days ago, I decided to dye my hair natural soft black.  At least that&#x27;s what it said on the package!  My hair is very dark brown naturally so I figured it would just make it richer looking.  HUGE mistake.  I ended up looking like Elvira.  I just couldn&#x27;t stand.  I looked up several home remedies like washing your hair with Dawn, baking soda, or Tide to remove the color but I couldn&#x27;t imagine these things would work.  After a lot of research, I decided to go with Color Oops.  I am so happy with my hair color.  It removed all of the black dye and returned my hair to a deep brownish color with red highlights.  I was concerned that the color would be too brassy and that I would have to re-dye it but it looks really nice so I didn&#x27;t re-dye it.  It&#x27;s a long process and you have to rinse, rinse, and rinse some more.  Also make sure to use a deep conditioner afterwards.  I put a deep conditioner in my hair, put on a cap, and let it sit for 30 minutes.  A co-worker commented that my hair looks healthier than before.  A lot of people complained about the smell.  It smells like a perm from the 80&#x27;s.  Not great but certainly not horrible.  I would definitely recommend this product.  It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.</li>
    <li> Six weeks ago I let my new young hairdresser color my blondish hair a copper color with highlights.  It was very copper, bordering on red.  After a few days and several washings it looked okay and I was getting used to it.  Yesterday I went back to the salon to get my roots touched up and a cut.  My stylist was gone, moved on, kapoof.  Fortunately, or so it seemed, another young hip looking stylist had time to give a color and cut.  Without any notes saying what colors had been used, he tried to match.  Additionally, we picked out a deep brown to add some low lights and frame my face.  Well, let me tell you.... I came out of there with RED lowlights, highlights and not a brown strand in sight.  And these were permanent dyes, not semi-permanent.  This morning I looked in the mirror and decided I had to do something.  I found Color Oops Extra Strength on line and headed to the CVS store.  They had one!  I followed the directions exactly and after 5 minutes of prep, 20 minutes of processing, shampooing, rinsing for 18 minutes, followed by another shampooing and 5 more minutes rinsing under the facet, and 10 minutes of restoration conditioner... I can say THIS PRODUCT WORKS.  Thank goodness.  I am pleased to have my natural sandy blonde color back.  My hair looks and feels wonderful.  No scalp irritation. No lingering smell.  Yes, buy it, follow the directions and you&#x27;ll be happy too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my red hair it turn it purple hair plus I&#x27;m African American woman with half Indian hair</li>
    <li> I had used Henna 2 months ago and if you know anything about henna you literally marry it!! I tried everything to fade it (olive oil dawn dish soap coconut oil lemon juice) then I had seen on a blog where somebody used oops and it took her 4 applications in a year and did I say marry it? Yes! My natural hair color is strawberry blonde but has faded with age and the henna turned me into reba red! I left oops on for 2 hours and I have to say it faded it a couple of shades! Im so happy with it that I will do another app in a month after I let my hair get a little more healthy. It didn&#x27;t damage my super fine hair at all but I did do a deep condition after</li>
    <li> I am a guy and I&#x27;m not as experienced at these type of things as most who would buy these type of products... I have been coloring my own hair for about 2 years when the grey was more prominent and the person who would color my hair, always did it too dark.. Because some of my grey has been tough to penetrate, the worker at Sally&#x27;s said to use Gray Magic. I did and it turned my hair bright orange!! WTF!!!! I died my hair three more times to get it to a somewhat livable color- which was a dark brown with a tint of red, but it looked bad on me and not natural. My hair is normally blonde... I went to an Applebees later that night and had a few drinks, not very happy because our band is debuting our first live performance next week and I&#x27;m not going to look like myself..  I told my friend the bartender and she told me about this stuff..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are better than I could have anticipated!! When you first take off the cap, you are blondish orange and kind of freaky looking.-- For me that would have still been a better alternative to my hair color at the time... lol.. But I followed the directions shampooed it out and rinsed for 20 minutes, then shampood again and rinsed for 5 minutes, just as it said. I also left the product in originally when I applied it for 20 minutes. I did everything to the letter that the directions said and my hair dye came out.. It worked perfectly!!! I highly recommend this to anyone who can follow directions and will adhere to the directions and be patient. It does smell bad, and some people say like rotten eggs or a sewer, but when your hair looks like something that came out of a sewer, it&#x27;s well worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, most of the reviews that I read that are negative are due to not following the directions. I also understand some of you have more extreme hair conditions,- and for some of you it may not work as well, but you have to follow the directions properly first, the results should be better than what you have currently... So weigh the pro&#x27;s and cons before using the product.. If your hair is a little out of wack, why risk doing something extreme like this. I would say you should only use this product for extreme circumstances and you can&#x27;t live with what you have now.. -J</li>
    <li> Had a very bad reaction to the chemicals in this product. I have asthma and it instantly activated the worst asthma attack i have ever had and my inhaler did not relieve my distress!  I had to call the ambulance because I really thought I was going to die.  After oxygen and treatments,  i was better in an hour.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOUR PRONE TO RESPIRATORY ILLNESS.</li>
    <li> I used Color oops two years ago.  It worked great, My Son complemented Me on My new hair color.  The funny thing was I had just used the color oops and left it as is.  I was 71 yrs with some grey around the face.  The grey had not come back, it was a light blonde!  Now I have another box of color oops to change things up again, but the problem is  no instructions, somehow they disappeared.  HELP!!!</li>
    <li> Naturally I have medium brown hair. I dyed my hair once to a lighter auburnish color but for some reason wanted it redder. Three weeks later I dyed my hair again and got Ronald McDonald red. I used Color Oops with high hopes. It worked pretty well. It didnt completely take the red out of my hair; it still has a slight copery look to it. But it did the job with out frying my hair. What I am unsatisfied about though, is that the soulution is so runny and it smells like rotten apples and eggs. After following the dirrections and washing my hair the next night, my hair still smells a bit.</li>
    <li> Did not  work as well as it said it would I probably won&#x27;t try it again</li>
    <li> I have natural thick dark red hair, my hair condition is not the best, due that I touch up my roots every month, sometimes I change completely my hair color, etc etc, but I don&#x27;t use hair drier, and NO flat iron.  Last time I colored light brown and I decided to change my color to a very light red but when I rinsed my hair was horrible, my ends were black, on the top it was beautiful but it looked very bad.  So I bought this product, it was so easy to use and just 15 minutes the black color was removed.  NO damage at all ( maybe because my hair is thick, I can&#x27;t speak for people with fine hair) but it was perfect.  I waited about a week to dye my hair again, but the box it say SAFE to re color the same day.  It worked for me.............Extra info---- I got it at Walmart, at least $2.00 dollars less.  Read the instructions and read the fine print before you use the this product......</li>
    <li> I was really nervous about trying this - read hundreds of reviews before purchasing at Walgreens. I had been dyeing my naturally dark brown hair various shades of red for ten years, and in a fit of midlife crisis dyed it dark brown in an attempt to get it back to my natural color. Big mistake. Came out closer to black. Lived with it for several months, until I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore, and then attempted to go back to one of my previous shades of red. Nope, came out black with a hint of purple - think Morticia Addams. So after spending literally hours online reading reviews, I picked up color oops. A friend and I did it together, as I have super long hair (nearly to my waist) and I was worried about applying it quickly enough. We followed the instructions exactly, except during the 20 minute rinse we shampooed every five minutes (and actually added a few extra minutes of rinsing at the end, bringing us closer to 25 min. My hair came out this lovely light brown shade, with lighter streaks from former highlights YEARS ago. I absolutely love it, not even going to redye although I had purchased new color in case it came out odd after the oops. This stuff is a miracle! Oh - as for the smell. My friend and I dyed her hair after doing the oops on mine, and we both agreed that the regular dye smelled worse than this. Also used a nutrogena triple recovery hair mask afterward - no damage. My hair is actually in slightly better shape than it was before. In short - if you are reading this - BUY THIS STUFF. You won&#x27;t regret it. Hope that helps! Before and after pics attached.</li>
    <li> I  have only used this twice but it seems to be safer  for your hair  than a lot of the other color removers out there (wish I could find the ingredients  though.)  One thing to note is the longer you&#x27;ve had the color in your hair, the less it will work.  It hardly made a dent in my ends, but worked well with my roots and most of the middle. Also going from an old black dye job is even harder, but it actually made an impact with mine. I am impressed  with it.</li>
    <li> I think I read all of the reviews before buying this product. There is a lot of useful information from some people.   I have been dying my hair brown/red for the the past 10 yrs and my hair falls past my bust almost to my waist. Since I&#x27;ve been dying it for so long, it seams no matter how light a color I go it always turns out a dark brown almost black. I have finally tired of it and went searching for ways to lighten it with out killing it or having to cut it all off.   I have to admit my skepticism on this product and actually watched a few videos of people trying it.     Its been about 2 weeks since I used it. (2 boxes) Yes it smells like lemon/egg farts (it is sulfur.) Make sure to clean your bathroom after you use it or it will smell till you do. Anyways! YES It lightened my hair! Hurray! I really like the color too. Kinda a caramel/brewed tea color. I have noticed it does seam to get darker in between showers. (Not because of oily hair.) But lightens up again after a good wash.    Now for somethings I think may have helped me. One person said you need to seal the hair shaft after all that washing and heat. Someone else mentioned freezing your conditioner. So for me I washed washed washed (felt dehydrated after that shower!!) and then used my really cold conditioner, let it sit for about 15mins and rinsed in a nice cool shower. Also if you&#x27;ve been using any products for color treated hair I recommend buying new ones as to not re oxidized those dye molecules.    People have mentioned that your hair darkens from how it looks from when you first do it. Yes mine has but not to badly ( I think its because I have made the effort to change the products I use, as mentioned above.) So I think I&#x27;m going to try it one more time too see if I can&#x27;t get it a little lighter. I hope I like it as much as the first time. I&#x27;m tired of such dark hair.     I also think I should mention that it had been at least a month since I last dyed my hair. And before that it had been about 6months.. So yes it works on old dye jobs. (That was something people weren&#x27;t to clear on.)    Good luck to all! I think it was worth a shot :)</li>
    <li> I have never written a review but had to for this amazing product. Last night I was attempting to color my hair \\&quot;medium ash brown\\&quot; but it came out black. I had purchased a box of Color Oops a long time ago and never ended up using it, so I skeptically pulled it out this morning to try to get the black out.     It could not have been easier using this product. It is much more liquidy than boxed hair color, but I liked it because it easily spread throughout my hair quickly and evenly.    I put it all over and waited the 20 minutes. You do have to spend a long time in the shower, however, I did not follow the directions exactly and it worked perfectly. It says to rinse for 15-20 minutes after the first shampoo and I lost patience after 10. I shampooed and rinsed twice more, then conditioned.    The black is all GONE. My normal medium brown is back! Completely even. I can&#x27;t believe how it easy it is.    One note: all over the web, people go on and on about the smell of this product. Does it smell like roses? No, HOWEVER, it was truly BARELY noticeable. People are wimps because they seriously scared me about how awful this was going to smell and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all!! Don&#x27;t let that scare you away. It didn&#x27;t stink up my bathroom or apartment at all. Once I rinsed it out it was gone.    Highly recommended for anyone who accidentally goes too dark! Don&#x27;t be scared of it; I am terrible at applying stuff like this and it was so simple and came out perfectly even and back to normal!</li>
    <li> After a decade of highlighting, both professional and homestyle, I decided to try all-over permanent haircolor again. (My natural color is \\&quot;dishwater\\&quot; blonde--light in front and browner in back--and I haven&#x27;t seen it in fifty years.) Since I had a good bit of highlighting, I decided to use Ash Blonde, thinking everything would blend well with that shade.  The type was either L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;Preference\\&quot; or \\&quot;Excellence,\\&quot; whichever one has the application nozzle like a little comb. Imagine my disappointment when my hair turned out a light pinkish brown!  Rather than restoring pale highlights (back to square one), I decided to try the \\&quot;Color Oops\\&quot; solution.  After reading the directions several times, I organized everything in my laundry room which has a untility sink and spray hose.  An old terrycloth kimono, a kitchen timer, a plastic comb, several towels and \\&quot;Oops,\\&quot; and I was ready to go.  As per the other reviews, the preparation is stinky but not unbearable.  I was a bit afraid of this unfamiliar process and left the stuff on for 16 minutes rather than the full 20; a couple of tests along the way revealed that 100% of the color probably was never going to come out anyway.  With the two shampooings (Pantene \\&quot;Restorative\\&quot; shampoo), I rinsed a total of about 25 minutes. Then I slathered on Pantene \\&quot;Restorative\\&quot; conditioner, covered with a towel, and left it 40 minutes.  After another thorough rinse and a quick blow-dry, the resulting color is a light-to-medium goldish blonde.  My hair does not seem unusually dry, but I will continue to use a rinse-out condition after shampooing and also a lightweight, leave-in conditioner the next few times I style.  I&#x27;m giving only four stars because my hair did not return fully to the color it was before I used the Ash Blonde permanent color.  Perhaps the full 20 minutes would have done the trick. Until the hair grows out and I resume highlighting, I can control the brassiness with an occasional application of one of the pale (bluish) \\&quot;Born Blonde\\&quot; shades.  All in all, a pretty good rescue job.</li>
    <li> If you want to be a blond, do not let your stylist add lowlights when doing highlights! Mine did and it was terribly ugly - I purchased oops after washing my hair daily for 3 weeks hoping the lowlights would fade. They didn&#x27;t. Oops worked great, I feel normal again.</li>
    <li> I am a fifty-something natural strawberry blonde whose hair is about 5% gray and actually now a brownish-dun-red color. My hair is thick but fine and I have had it home-dyed once before and salon dyed twice before. I recently had highlights and lowlights done professionally. I wanted to add some coppery sheen and minimize the gray and applied Clairol \\&quot;Nice&#x27;n easy\\&quot; #108, \\&quot;Natural reddish blonde\\&quot; for only 15 minutes. My hair came out looking like a red clown wig- orange-red- flaming- aghhhh! I wore it one day like that (mostly waiting until the sun went down to venture outside) and decided that I couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;embrace\\&quot; the new color. I Googled \\&quot;dyed hair too red\\&quot; and \\&quot;Color Oops\\&quot; came up. Thank God! I read many wonderful reviews, some with cautions, and decided that I had little to lose. I purchased a box of Extra Strength Color Oops at CVS (the guy at the register was kind enough not to point and laugh at Bozo)and went home and followed the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;. I took a large wall clock into the bathroom with me so that I could keep time from the shower. I washed and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed and washed and rinsed- whew! I now am a peach blonde (not a bleached blonde or even a beach blonde), certainly not my original brownish-dun-red, but I have all of my gray hair back. This new weird color is a little more presentable than the Bozo red, but all in all, I say \\&quot;NEVER AGAIN\\&quot; WITH HOME DYES. When/if the urge to change my look comes again, I will JUST SAY NO OR GO TO A PROFESSIONAL. I am not able to do plumbing or electrical work or sew perfectly tailored clothing or repair the brakes on my car- what makes me think that I can combine strong chemicals with myriad variables and reactions and put them on my hair and get good results??? Never again! By the way, the smell of the Color Oops was bad, but I was expecting worse. It permeated everything and is still smelly a day after I applied it. I just threw the clothes that I wore and the towel that I used in the garbage. Goodluck to you all....B</li>
    <li> This product does not lift dark colors very easily. I picked up a box at Walmart today, it said it will lift to the color I had before using the temporary dye. Which was like a golden blonde and then I semi-dyed it bright red and later blood red. I used a single application and it lifted it to an orange-like tone but some red was still in it. It said I can re-apply a second time but I took no chances considering this stuff stinks really bad like egg smell. It also made my hair kind of frizzy (after shampoo)  but not dry, so I put oil on my scalp and hair it should help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> This was probably the single WORST product I&#x27;ve EVER used in my life. I have no idea how other people are leaving reviews that it&#x27;s worked - maybe they&#x27;re giving employees a bonus to leave &#x27;em here?!    I needed this to remove black from my hair &amp; according to the directions, it should&#x27;ve worked. I dunno how it&#x27;s supposed to work, unless by \\&quot;working\\&quot; you mean the awful burned perm smell that it leaves on your hair, but it completely WRECKED my hair. It&#x27;s sooo dried out &amp; guess what? It&#x27;s STILL black! I followed the directions EXACT &amp; still, nothing except dry, frizzy, hair.    I&#x27;ll stick w/the good old fashion bleaching to remove color - @ least then I won&#x27;t be foolish enough to think I have some kinda \\&quot;miracle in a bottle\\&quot; &amp; find total disappointment in the end.    Don&#x27;t buy it &amp; if ya do, have about 10 things of deep condition ready to put on your nappy, frizzy, fried, hair. Yuk, yuk, yuk!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m have blonde hair and I dyed it black and I didn&#x27;t like it black so I used this and my hair looked just like it used to.</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove the purple dye in my hair; turns out, Color Oops does not work on what I call \\&quot;fun colors,\\&quot; such as blues, greens, purples, etc. It even says so on the very bottom of the instructions. I wish that the manufacturers had put that on the box, so that I had not wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, it did lighten the purple, somewhat. Not enough to dye over, but just enough to be noticeable.</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well. Has a smell, but plenty of circulating air fixes that quickly.</li>
    <li> From the fine print at the end of the instructions: \\&quot;Color Oops is not designed for and will not perform on direct color dyes such as bright pinks, blues, greens, lavenders, purples, etc.\\&quot;  You darn well should have put that in the item description.</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is black but I have been lightening my hair for several months to brown and red. Recently I decided to switch to a blue black color. While it was nice at first (albeit containing some red from my previous dye), the blue faded really quickly, and my hair ended up being a very dull, borderline silver black with red tints. It look unappealing. I tried to lighten my hair back to brown but the black stubbornly stuck on and only my roots changed color. I researched that a hair color remover like Color Oops would be needed to remove the black. I decided to go with Color Oops over L&#x27;Oreal Hair Color Remover. Within 15 minutes of application, BOTH the black and persistent red were stripped from my hair, leaving my hair a orangey brown color like my roots. Worked like a charm! Of course, I had to labor through the 25-minute rinsing process after (oh my god, it was SO TEDIOUS and tiring being in the shower for that long), but hey, it was worth it. My hair came out a nice brown and almost no damage was done to it at all! MAGIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, as the other reviews say, it smells unpleasantly strong and does reek of rotten eggs. But it&#x27;s livable and you&#x27;ll certainly get used to it. And yes, the rinsing process is like labor. But these are small prices to pay to getting your hair color fixed. Plus, there&#x27;s no bleach in it so it won&#x27;t do massive damage to your hair. The product really works! Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Got the black out of my hair</li>
    <li> Background: Natural blonde who has been dying her hair for nearly 10 years. Was dark auburn at the time of using product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go back to blonde because it was too much hassle keeping up with the roots, its a normal thing that happens with me every few years, but I didn&#x27;t want to wait for my hair to grow out so I did some research and found Color Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short, shoulder length, thick hair. I needed two boxes to fully saturate my hair. I probably could have used three but two did the job. Since my hair is so thick I let it set for about 40 minutes. If you have thick hair you need to or it won&#x27;t do anything. My friend has much thinner hair and after fifteen minutes her hair was starting to lighten, just as a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application doesn&#x27;t smell so bad but after you&#x27;ve washed it out there will be a lingering sulfur smell for a few days, its easily covered with another application of conditioner. The hair will feel a little dry at first, especially if you use heat on your hair so be wary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST RINSE FOR TWENTY MINUTES. With the hottest water you can take. Then wash for 5 minutes. Rise for 5 minutes. And repeat 4 more times. Use a shampoo that moisturizes so your hair doesn&#x27;t become like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will get super light and then darken. You can dye if you want right after but if you let it settle for a few days it won&#x27;t interfere with the dying process as much. It didn&#x27;t take my hair back to my natural color, but it got close and left it with a strawberry blonde shade and I&#x27;m still deciding if I want to dye it lighter but was a much easier and cheaper process than doing it at a salon. I suggest it to anyone that wants to go back to their natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAIR WARNING: If you have ever bleached your hair, it will not come out so nicely it will be much more like an orange color, so you might want to look into dying it afterward.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have natural red hair - the kind that does not come in a bottle. If I had a dollar for every compliment I have received on my natural hair color, I would be rich. Too bad we are never satisfied. I have colored my hair many times over the years and as soon as I dye it, I am on a mission to get my natural hair color back - because nothing ever looks right. For years I have used bleach to correct my hair color mishaps. Of course that is damaging and always leaves my hair much lighter than I prefer. So anyhow this time I used color oops and if I am dumb enough to try to achieve a better color for myself again, I will know exactly what to use to fix my mistake. This is what happened this time. And yes, I know this will make me seem extremely idiotic. But maybe it will help you! I colored my hair a chocolate cherry mousse. It came out very artificial looking. Quite disgusting in my opinion. It had a deep pink tint that I just could not handle. The next day I went to the beauty supply and got a dark auburn color thinking this would make it more of a brown. Besides, auburn was more of what I was going for in the first place. It made it even darker, but still had that pink tint. I let it sit over the the weekend. I actually got compliments on it, but felt it did not look right with my skin color. So on Monday I tried the color oops. I did exactly what it said. And btw I was not gagging over the smell - and I am 6 months pregnant. (Yes - I got the ok from my DR.) The smell is bad, but completely tolerable. Once I started rinsing I saw that my hair looked normal. I was very excited. I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed until the water ran cold. I used a crappy shampoo hoping this would help to strip my hair. By the time I finished rinsing I  thought the color already looked like it had darkened back up. Boo. After I dried my hair it was lighter. Not normal, but lighter. It did look better. I was hoping it would take more out, but like I said, it was better. So a couple weeks past and the idiot strikes again. I had a box of hair color in the cabinet that was closer to my natural hair color. It showed that it would turn dark brown hair red. It didn&#x27;t. Maybe because my hair was artificially brown. So there I was with darker hair again. After smacking myself a few times for not just leaving it alone, I used the highlighting kit that came with the dye. The highlights came out great. And honestly if I had just skipped the last coloring and just highlighted my hair after the last color oops, I would have been happy... I think. So another couple of weeks go by and although my hair looks much better I was still annoyed with how dark it was underneath the highlights. So I started think I might try another color oops on it. That brings us to today. I was much faster about applying the color oops today - not sure why, but I guess I am getting good at it! And it does say to apply it quickly. I used a wide tooth comb and combed through it a couple times while applying. After the time was up I put a step ladder in the shower to sit on - because like I said I am pregnant. Standing in the shower for 30+ minutes is very uncomfortable these days. I rinsed for about 5 minutes and then used head and shoulders - since I read that dandruff and clarifying shampoos help remove color. Then I rinsed for 20 minutes and washed it again. Then I rinsed for 5 more. I do have very thick and long hair so I did not want to skimp on the rinsing. The entire time I rinsed I noticed that my hair looked normal. I kept waiting for it to darken back up. I got out of the shower and towel dried my hair. It looked much lighter than before. I applied a deep conditioner that said to leave it on for 5 minutes and rinse. I didn&#x27;t rinse though because my hair felt like crap. I then dried my hair with the conditioner on it. I still have not noticed it darkening and it feels soft and I look like me again. After about $80 of products I look nearly the same as I did before I started. Point being that if I had used Color Oops after the first coloring I could have saved myself a lot of time and money. Hopefully you will benefit from this. Oh and btw I picked this product up at Walgreen&#x27;s for $13.99.</li>
    <li> My hair is shoulder length - thick and coarse - naturally dark brown/black but that was years ago. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair dark brown/black for at least 10 years. Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to allow my grey (80%ish) to grow in without the skunk look. I tried the spray color to avoid dying my roots (no good) and then switched to a semi-permanent to try and even out the color while it grew out...as directed by the experts I went a shade or two lighter to gradually step-down but what I ended up with was red roots with the warm brown and yellow roots with the natural brown...also no good. So, I decided that removing the color and then re-dying a lighter brown would be the best bet.  I headed to Wal-Mart and in anticipation of the amount of dye in my hair I grabbed two boxes of the OOPS ES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, it&#x27;s easy to use. Mix it just like hair dye, apply it to dry hair just like hair dye, cover and wait 20 min (just like hair dye), and rinse. It&#x27;s clear and really runny (unlike hair dye) so be prepared and wear something that you can ruin. I have a special turtle neck I use just for coloring my hair (helps keep it off my neck and arms). It has a sulfur smell but no one in the house complained. I rinsed for a few minutes, washed and then rinsed for another 20, washed again  and rinsed for five as the box directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time my roots were really blonde and the rest of the hair was a dark medium brown. I did a leave in conditioner and then rinsed the next morning, my hair was a little darker but the roots were still blonde. I did a coconut oil protein treatment, rinsed and let dry. So, I did another application, same steps as above but I rinsed much longer since I know the hair darkening over time was due to color particles that were left behind and re-oxidized. This time my hair came out a beautiful and even strawberry dirty blonde from root to tip. I got lots of compliments on it all evening, it was really shiny and natural looking, I decided I wasn&#x27;t even going to color over it until the grow-out was noticeable. I put a light-weight overnight conditioner in my hair to help with any damage and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really sad to wake-up and see that I was back to gold/brown roots and dark medium brown hair. Yeah, it blends in better with my eyebrows, but basically at almost $10 a box, my hair looks like it did before I started removing the color...$20 down the drain. It&#x27;s not worth trying another box at that price - especially since the whole purpose of the home treatment is because I couldn&#x27;t afford the professional treatment....and I&#x27;ve run the hot water out of the shower both time I applied the OOPS ES, so rinsing longer doesn&#x27;t seem to be the answer. Either the dye in my hair is too much or the OOPS is not enough.  I&#x27;m told that One and Only Color Fix by Conair is better, I will try that next but unless anyone else has any suggestions, if it doesn&#x27;t work I don&#x27;t know what else to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be a good product is you are removing a light color or if you are removing a single application of color. If you are a regular dark colored dye user you might want to test it but be prepared. Also, to put a few ideas to rest...there is not a single color remover or fixer that will return you to your natural color. All dyes leave a base - usually red, orange, or yellow, though sometimes blue/purple - that&#x27;s why I ended up with yellow, red, and strawberry blonde. If you don&#x27;t like the results (most won&#x27;t) - You will have to re-dye your hair after using the removers/fixers, just re-dye to a color a shade or two lighter than your natural color (or the desired color). Once you use a remover/fixer your hair is more porous and locks on to more color - so any color will turn out a shade or two darker than it is supposed to - use a shade or two lighter, you can always dye darker again if you need to...for most though, one dye to return you to your natural (or desired) color will be all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It recommends that you use a protein filler before coloring to help reduce the amount of color your hair soaks up. Walmart sells them by single use packets in the hair care isle, usually next to the ethnic hair care....mine was less than $2...Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply also sells them that way. I used one as a treatment to help reduce damage - I haven&#x27;t colored yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone else has any ideas I&#x27;d love to hear them - hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> For years I had been dying my hair at home with a permanent chestnut brown or dark auburn color. A few months ago I decided to dye my hair black using L&#x27;Oreal Preference/Soft Black. It didn&#x27;t look terrible but I got tired of it being so dark. I had expected it to fade but it never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading a ton of good reviews, I decided to give Color Oops a try. I purchased the Extra Strength and just used it on my hair a little while ago following the instructions inside the box. The smell was not nearly as bad as I expected. It smelled like sulfur, but very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing and shampooing I applied a deep conditioner and rinsed that out after 5 minutes. I then applied a leave-in conditioner and am now letting my hair air dry. My hair is at least 3 shades lighter and is now a light to medium brown, which is very close to the last color that I had used before I dyed my hair black. My hair is not completely dry yet but so far I am really happy with the color and with how much lighter it is. I can still see some black here and there but it looks really nice.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair for about 14 years. Naturally I have medium/dark brown hair and I dye it various shades of browns for years now to give my hair some good color instead of being such a plain brown. Anyway I recently got the bright idea to dye it BLACK. It looked decent but I could not get used to it and just felt so ugly. It was much too bold for my taste. I look best with red and gold tones in my hair. After about 3 days of being miserable with it and getting a few negative reactions I started searching for a way to change it, figuring that I&#x27;d have to live with it for months to come. Came across color oops and went to Walgreens immediately and bought 2 boxes (I have medium thick hair past my boobs). I figured at $9.99 per box it would be very worth it. I followed all directions, rinsed my hair profusely (about 25 minutes but with my long thick hair I probably should have rinsed  more), washed twice followed by rinsing, then conditioned it and was pretty amazed that my hair was magically back to the color it was before I dyed it black!! Actually I think it was a bit lighter, but it has continued to darken into a nice rich dark brown with a nice red tone and some gold highlights. I actually really love it. It&#x27;s the color I usually aim for when I dye it.... Anyway, it works!! Follow directions and I don&#x27;t see any reason why it wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Note: as far as damage, I do feel that my hair seems a little bit \\&quot;off\\&quot;, the texture is different or something. Not terrible but I do feel as if my hair feels different, maybe slightly distressed. Ill update if anything changes.</li>
    <li> This stuff works nearly as well as it claims to. I had medium brown hair with highlights and tried to dye it a dark brown, but it came out utterly black. I didn&#x27;t find out about Color Oops until two months later, and gave it a shot anyway. It stripped the colour out even after two months! What I got in the end was a brassier version of what I had before, which was fine because it was light enough to dye it.&lt;br /&gt;Important tips:&lt;br /&gt;-It will NOT remove fake colours like green, pink, blue, etc. It only removes regular colours and it says so in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;-It can only work if you dyed your hair darker and want the light colour back. All it does is remove the dye, it can&#x27;t restore colour to hair that was stripped with bleach or highlights, so don&#x27;t bother unless you accidentally dyed it too dark.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is very strong and it will take days to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;-Even though it isn&#x27;t bleach, it will dry out your hair so have some reparative conditioner to use after.&lt;br /&gt;-If you want to dye it again right after, you need to buy a lighter shade than normal. The hair will be porous and will soak up a huge amount of dye, meaning you will end up with too-dark hair all over again if you aren&#x27;t careful about getting a light enough colour.&lt;br /&gt;-The mixture is thin, my hair only goes to my chin and I still used the whole bottle. You might need two bottles, or I have heard of other people mixing in a bit of shampoo to thicken it but I didn&#x27;t take the risk myself so I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;-The dye may have permanently stripped some colour and made it slightly orange, so it&#x27;s good to have a new dye on hand just in case.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I was skeptical. From the age 15 I&#x27;ve constantly dyed my hair Jet Black at least once a month, if not twice. Up until recently I went around 6 months without dying it, and I finally decided I wanted to go brunette (my natural color). Not just brunette, but ombre. So I went ahead and picked up a box of this miraculous hair stripper, and to my surprise it WORKED. I mean, it made my hair a darker/bronze/copper brown. But hey, it lightened quite a bit AND did not ruin my hair what so ever. It definitely exceeded my expectations and I really hope it will bring a smile to your face because it had that affect on me.</li>
    <li> Plain and simple- this stuff doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Save your money and try something else, like bleach (depending on how dark your hair is).  I was foolish enough to dye my dark blonde hair jet black, and I&#x27;ve officially tried every single color remover on the market with absolutely no change.  Bleach is the next step, which I was trying to avoid so I don&#x27;t turn my hair to straw, but I refuse to keep it black forever.</li>
    <li> A month ago, I bleached my hair for the first time. The bleach turned my light red hair a pale yellow, and then I put an ash blonde toner over it. The ash blonde hair was cool (for awhile) but I soon tired of it and decided I wanted the red back.    A month later, I decided (for some ungodly reason) that BRIGHT COPPER RED hair might look cool on me. And guess what? It didn&#x27;t. It was the fakest, brighest, loudest most ridiculous color of clown red that I&#x27;d ever seen in my life. I panicked...    And then I turned to Color Oops. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but I thought I&#x27;d try it. I thought maybe (at best) it would take my hair to a light orangeish shade that I could work with.    The Color Oops liquid was the runniest thing I&#x27;d ever seen in my life. My sister and I were working together to fix my hair, and we got the giggles when he realized it smelled like a \\&quot;lemon fart.\\&quot; Within minutes of putting the lemon fart in my hair, I started to notice a change...    But it was even BETTER than I could have imagined! I had my BLEACHED BLONDE hair back!!!!     I was amazed! I was so relieved, I almost cried tears of joy! Other people seemed to have bad things to say about it here at Amazon, but if you have a similar situation as me (with bleached hair underneath) you might find YOUR miracle in a bottle! Even my roots, which had about an inch of growth after a month, are now bleached yellow/blonde. It&#x27;s amazing! I would swear by this product forever!</li>
    <li> My hair was originally a nice, dark chocolate brown. For context, I&#x27;m caucasian and 31 years old. You can see a picture of my original haircolor in my profile. A few years ago, I took to experimenting with my hair and got dark blonde highlights. They looked nice, but then in the fall I longed for my darker mane, so I got dark highlights in order to start phasing out the blonde ones. That didn&#x27;t work as fast as I wanted to, so I eventually just covered the whole thing over with a dark auburn color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings us to the last few months. I decided I wanted it a light copper red, so a series of disasters began with the objective of turning me into a redhead. It kinda worked... but a few months later, I was fed up with the upkeep and I wanted it brown &amp; easy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new goal was to end up with a medium golden brown that would be a little lighter than my natural color, but hopefully blend in nicely with my new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Color Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PREPARATION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the following products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B0012JY4G4 Color Oops Hair Color Remover Extra Strength 1 Application]]&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B001HBN5JO COLORFUL Neutral Protein Filler Hairdressers Color Insurance 16 oz/473 ml]]&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B00IB0D2Z6 Seventh Generation Dish Liquid, Free &amp; Clear, 25 Fl Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B002UD52MG Loreal Series Expert Vitamino Color Masque, 6.7-Ounces Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;- [[ASIN:B004D1R0CS Clairol Perfect 10 By Nice &#x27;N Easy Hair Color 6.5g Lightest Golden Brown 1 Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mid-back hair but it is not very thick, so I didn&#x27;t think I would need more than one box of Color Oops. If you normally only need one box of dye, then one box of Color Oops will work just fine. The dish liquid soap I normally keep in stock for my kitchen, but here I decided to use it in place of regular shampoo to help get the Color Oops off my hair. I could have used clarifying shampoo, but this was a much more cost-effective solution. The Neutral Protein filler to assist with the coloring process afterwards. It&#x27;s important so don&#x27;t skip it! I also felt that my hair would probably need some extra love after all this, hence the L&#x27;Oreal Vitamino masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the Clairol Perfect 10 in Lightest Golden Brown to dye after the Color Oops. I chose this shade, which is a lot lighter than my intended color, because I kept reading that after the Color Oops, my hair would grab on to the color much more readily and turn it darker. Now, the Protein Filler was supposed to remedy this, but my hair always ends up much darker than the box so I thought that this would be a safe choice anyway. I reasoned that if the color really turned out too light, it is much easier to fix than if it turns out too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROCESS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STEP 1: Stripping Color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brushed through my hair and quickly mixed and applied the Color Oops through my head. The smell was pretty bad and my eyes burned as I was applying it. It was tolerable, though. The consistency of the product is NOT water as other reviews have said. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably closer to the consistency of liquid hand soap. Once I was done applying it, I put the shower cap that came with the Color Oops on. The cap is actually pretty small... it won&#x27;t fit you if you have a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 20 minutes, I returned to the bathroom. Upon inspection, my hair didn&#x27;t seem to have changed that much... it went from a faded light auburn to a milk chocolate brown, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I set a kitchen timer to 30 minutes and put it by the shower so I could see it. Knowing the importance of the rinsing part of the process, I wanted to make sure that I spent enough time doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopped into the shower and began rinsing. Once I&#x27;d gotten most of the product out, I applied my Seventh Generation dish soap and proceeded to wash my hair thoroughly. I rinsed it all out and repeated the process three times. When the timer was down to 5 minutes, Iapplied a good amount of L&#x27;Oreal Vitamino masque and let it sit for a few minutes while I proceeded to finish my shower as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my hair dry naturally and immediately noticed it was orange. Not pumpkin orange but more like tree leaves in the Fall kind of orange. Very much expected, since my hair had obviously been lightened by the repeated dying processes over the last few years. This meant that Color Oops had successfully done its job! However, I couldn&#x27;t keep this color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a lot of reviews say that Color Oops did not damage their hair, and frankly, I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. My hair felt very smooth and healthy in the beginning... but even with the masque I applied, my hair did NOT feel good after Color Oops. It wasn&#x27;t as bad as bleaching, but it definitely felt rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was late, so I decided to go to bed and dye my hair in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STEP 2: Restoring your Color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out by moistening my hair slightly and then combed through it and pretty much saturated it with the Neutral Protein filler. I could have applied it on dry hair, but that makes it more difficult to comb through. I let it sit for 20 minutes, which turned it to straw as it dried. This is normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proceeded to apply my dye right on top of the protein filler, Clairol Perfect 10 in Lightest Golden Brown (6.5G) and put on the shower cap included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I knew that I was only supposed to leave the dye for 5 minutes, according to the Color Oops box. However, considering that I had applied a protein filler and the dye was a lot lighter than I intended, I decided to leave it the full 10 minutes that this particular brand requires. This turned out to be the correct decision! Read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the 10 minutes were up, I hopped in the shower. I added a bit of water to my head and used the dye to make lather like shampoo, then rinsed out til water ran clear. I put on another healthy dose of L&#x27;Oreal Vitamino masque and again let it sit while I finished my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before stepping out, I rinsed out my hair with cold water. Mind you, I live in Upstate NY, so it is more like ice cold this time of the year. Good way to wake you up in the morning! It also helps close your hair cuticle and keep the color in ;) Don&#x27;t miss this step! Though you may want to just invert your head into the bathtub so you don&#x27;t freeze like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE AFTERMATH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after dying my hair, I let it airdry. At this point, I thought the color turned out a little too light and too brassy. It didn&#x27;t look bad at all, but it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. So, I came back to Amazon and ordered a box of [[ASIN:B001LFEVSK Clairol Perfect 10 in Medium Ash Brown (5A)]]. I figured I&#x27;d throw it on for five minutes and that would darken the color and neutralize the brassiness. It was a good plan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was two days ago and I just received it. However, an interesting thing happened... My color seems to have \\&quot;settled\\&quot; and it now looks exactly the shade I wanted! I have not applied any shampoo yet, so this is most likely due to the previous Color Oops application. I have read this happened to other people. If you&#x27;re curious, look at the box model of [[ASIN:B0015NMSHY Clairol Perfect 10 in Medium Golden Brown (5G)]] and that&#x27;s exactly what my head looks like. It&#x27;s the actual shade I was shooting for, and it&#x27;s a tiny bit lighter than my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair actually feels really good after the dye application. It is very soft and shiny, though the ends still feel a little bit rough. Overall, I am happy with the final color and feel of my hair. I don&#x27;t plan to use the additional dye I purchased immediately, but I will keep it in case that it fades too much over the next few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if any further changes occur, but for now, consider me a happy customer!as normal.

I proceeded to apply my dye right on top of the protein filler, Clairol Perfect 10 in Lightest Golden Brown (6.5G) and put on the shower cap included.    At this point, I knew that I was only supposed to leave the dye for 5 minutes, according to the Color Oops box. However, considering that I had applied a protein filler and the dye was a lot lighter than I intended, I decided to leave it the full 10 minutes that this particular brand requires. This turned out to be the correct decision! Read on...    Once the 10 minutes were up, I hopped in the shower. I added a bit of water to my head and used the dye to make lather like shampoo, then rinsed out til water ran clear. I put on another healthy dose of L&#x27;Oreal Vitamino masque and again let it sit while I finished my shower.    Before stepping out, I rinsed out my hair with cold water. Mind you, I live in Upstate NY, so it is morelike ice cold this time of the year. Good way to wake you up in the morning! It also helps close your hair cuticle and keep the color in ;) Don&#x27;t miss this step! Though you may want to just invert your head into the bathtub so you don&#x27;t freeze like I did.    THE AFTERMATH:    Right after dying my hair, I let it airdry. At this point, I thought the color turned out a little too light and too brassy. It didn&#x27;t look bad at all, but it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. So, I came back to Amazon and ordered a box of [[ASIN:B001LFEVSK Clairol Perfect 10 in Medium Ash Brown (5A)]]. I figured I&#x27;d throw it on for five minutes and that would darken the color and neutralize the brassiness. It was a good plan...    That was two days ago and I just received it. However, an interesting thing happened... My color seems to have \\&quot;settled\\&quot; and it now looks exactly the shade I wanted! I have not applied any shampoo yet, so this is most likely due to the previous Color Oops application. I have read this happened to other people. If you&#x27;re curious, look at the box model of [[ASIN:B0015NMSHY Clairol Perfect 10 in Medium Golden Brown (5G)]] and that&#x27;s exactly what my head looks like. It&#x27;s the actual shade I was shooting for, and it&#x27;s a tiny bit lighter than my natural color.    My hair actually feels really good after the dye application. It is very soft and shiny, though the ends still feel a little bit rough. Overall, I am happy with the final color and feel of my hair. I don&#x27;t plan to use the additional dye I purchased immediately, but I will keep it in case that it fades too much over the next few washes.    I will update this review if any further changes occur, but for now, consider me a happy customer!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m blonde and wanted a little color for the Holidays. I bought the Paint The Town Red color (Herbal Essense??). If I lived in New York city and worked at a tatoo parlor, it was really cool...but that&#x27;s not the situation. After way too much attention from strangers cuz \\&quot;Your hair is soooo red\\&quot; I was fed up. No really, I lost hours of sleep trying to figure out what to do. Then I found Color Oops. I used it just as it said. Washed my hair and rinsed my hair a couple times ( I think this step is key) and low and behold...my blonde was back. I found the strawberry blonde by nice and easy and did my hair with that color the same night. It turned out awesome. I was sooooo happy I could have cried. Just make sure you use a lot of conditioner (you may be alarmed how dry your hair feels after the color oops) but when I put the next color in and used the conditioner, it felt wonderful. My hair has been fine since and it&#x27;s April now. Hopefully this helps as I really appreciated finding this product from someone else&#x27;s post.</li>
    <li> I have copper red hair and I tried to dye it a deeper red...2 more dyes later and I had messed it up so bad that I had BLACK hair. I bought this product at Walgreens for about $15. I was a little skeptical but I didn&#x27;t think it could get much worse. It doesn&#x27;t smell near as bad as some claim. The Application and process were pretty simple. When I got out of the shower I couldn&#x27;t believe my hair was almost it&#x27;s natural color, just a little more blonde. Color Oops doesn&#x27;t use bleach or ammonia so it wasn&#x27;t too hard on my sensitive hair. Who ever made this product is a genius.</li>
    <li> I had never used a hair color remover before this. First thing i disliked about the product was the HORRIBLE smell. I washed my hair 10+ times and it still smelled like it. Smells exactly like VOMIT. Besides that, it dried out my hair beyond words and didn&#x27;t even remove the color. Better off using BLEACH. I do not recommend this.</li>
    <li> worked very well, the smell from it is awful ..went from an totally undesired color to one alot more livable..</li>
    <li> Removing color was excellent. However asthmatics beware. Sulfurs may cause asthma attacks or cause unforeseen symptoms. I had an asthma attack from this and don&#x27;t want anyone to go through the same thing. You&#x27;re your own nightmare since the smell stays in your hair and believe me I tried to get the smell out as best as I could and lost a whole nights sleep over the whole experience. Not fun at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local Walmart last night and I was EXTREMELY happy with my results. My hair was a mixture of years worth of red and brown. In just 20 minutes my hair became a coppery blonde. The color was gone with only a little bit of dryness in my hair but some conditioner should fix it right up. I would not hesitate to use this again. Just be careful, it&#x27;s really runny.</li>
    <li> Dyed my hair black a few months ago, BIG MISTAKE.  I was so hesitant on ordering this.  I received it in the mail today and did the strand test... honestly, i couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.  Which made me even more nervous to use it.  I said what the heck and went for it. And let me say, this product is amazing.  It definitely did not turn my hair back to its natural colored, as I figured.  My hair is a beautiful auburn red now.  I love it. I will say the smell is god awful, smells like rotten eggs.  Also, it did burn my scalp while i was waiting the 20 minutes to rinse it out, however I do have sensitive skin.  Id definitely recommend this product. Shipping was pretty fast too!</li>
    <li> Retail is super greed, if you want anything hair you really need to check with thse people. They are reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I used this to remove reddish hair color that I had in my hair for over two years. It removed every bit of red, but left my hair a brassy light brown after. My natural color is a light to medium brown. I followed the color oops directions exactly, as I had read that the most important part was the rinsing! Be sure to rinse a full 20 minutes! It did leave my hair feeling straw like immediately after, so I applied a neutral protein filler as recommended before coloring and then colored my hair a medium brown. I left the hair color on for only 5 minutes, because after color oops, your hair will be super pourous and color very quickly. After coloring, I applied a hair conditioning mask and now my hair is back feeling silky, but just a different color.  Would definitely use this again to remove color!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to use this product. I went to a high-end salon who double processed my hair to black. I had gone to the salon because I had partial highlights of blonde that I wanted to get rid of and go back to my natural color all over, which is medium dark brown. But the salon change my hair to jet black. I was extremely upset. I bought this product, followed the directions exactly and my hair is back to its natural brown color, no partial highlights. I am so grateful and happy. I did this two days after the salon fiasco. And my partial highlights were done four months ago. And those are gone. Buy this product.</li>
    <li> This product is best on new colour, and even knowing that I decided to give it a try before diving into the bleach.  It definitely lightened my dark red hair.  I have used it before, immediately after a colour mistake, and it does work as it claims.  The smell is, understandably, horrible, but I mean... it&#x27;s chemicals, people :P  Less damaging than bleach, and I would recommend it to anyone trying to undo some of their darker mishaps</li>
    <li> This worked great for me. I have naturally light light brown hair with natural highlights. I, with regret, got a temporary color (gloss treatment) for a darker &amp;#34;Fall/Winter&amp;#34; shade and HATED IT. So I bought this to try and get my color back ASAP. It worked but unfortunately my highlights were lost in the coloring. (they&#x27;re from the sun, so maybe next year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a good idea to use this if you went blonde from dark hair, go to a salon to get help, or your hair will turn out orange.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and slightly wavy. Even in my 50s, I have very little gray. I usually like to lighten it a shade or two and use a bronze type of brown. The Feria bronze browns are my favorite, and I really should have stuck with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I colored my hair with a foam product by John Frieda -- a medium golden brown that looked beautiful on the box. I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair myself for years. I was shocked to see that my hair came out nearly black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried all the tricks to lighten it -- Prell, dish soap. It lightened very little. I thought perhaps I could manage and let it fade over time, but every time I saw myself in the mirror I just got depressed. The color was just way too dark for someone my age and skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews, I decided to take a chance and boy am I ever glad that I did. The only one I could find in the store was the strongest version. I did the strand test and saw that it lightened it up a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to be prepared in case my hair came out too light. I couldn&#x27;t get to the beauty supply to get protein filler to use before coloring again, so I decided to use the emergency Clairol Beautiful Brown warm golden brown I have on hand if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the letter. I found that I only needed half the bottle, since my hair is so fine. It is long, but I never have to use a whole bottle of anything on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to process my hair for less time with the Color Oops since the test strand came out so light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept checking the color during the processing time - and when my hair lightened to the shade desired- probably around 10-12 minutes total -  immediately started the washing and rinsing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to really follow that instruction about doing period strand tests. Don&#x27;t just wait the whole 20 minutes. Depending on the type of hair you have and the dye process you used, you may not need to process the whole time. That could be why some people come out with orange hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be that I needed less time because I was using the extra strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that 20 minutes of rinsing is a really, really long time. But I stuck it out to make sure all the stuff was rinsed out. My hair seemed a bit stiff. I conditioned it for 5 minutes and found that my hair is silky, a great color and seems to have more life than it did before using Color Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old stylist taught me some tricks -- one of which is a Godsaver that I will share. If a color comes out too light -- or your hair fades too fast - use a semi-perm color such as the Clairol Beautiful products... They have all shades in the beauty supply; I use the Beautiful Browns. They may have changed the name, but it comes in a small brown bottle and costs under $4. I can get 2 uses out of one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, I did not need to recolor -- which was a relief. With my fine, thinning hair, I didn&#x27;t want to be coloring it again right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if my hair continues to fade too fast, I will just use the Clairol Beautiful Browns temporarily - until I think my hair is strong enough to endure another coloring process. But this time, it will be my tried and true Feria bronze color. No more John Frieda coloring products for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, it was on sale at Wags for 9.99 (regularly 14.99) - so that was great, too. Now if I would just have remembered to use the $1 off coupon I&#x27;d printed out, it would have been 8.99! Look online for coupons -- and don&#x27;t forget to use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -- I noticed that after using it, the next few times I washed my hair a lot of it fell out. Could be that I used too strong a product - I have very fine hair. I do not lighten it or use many styling products on it. I noticed that my hair was really porous and much more fragile than it was and this lasted for a while. I won&#x27;t be using it again. I&#x27;ll just be more careful about the colors I choose and use only the ones I&#x27;m familiar with so I don&#x27;t end up too dark again.</li>
    <li> The most important thing I can say about this product is... WAIT 24 HOURS MINIMUM BEFORE REDYEING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now here&#x27;s my story. I have naturally golden blonde hair, think the color of wheat, and I dyed it dark brown because I broke up with my boyfriend and was feeling rebellious. After about 2.5 months (box dyeing every 3 weeks or so, due to fading), I realized that this look is too high maintence for me and I wanted my blonde locks back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product sitting and waiting for me since the first night that I dyed my hair, incase I absolutely hated the dark brown, so I decided to put it to use. I followed the instructions and ended up with bright orange, strawberry blond-ish hair. I was a little worried, but I didn&#x27;t freak out, and instead embraced my gingerness for the day. About 24 hours after the application, the ginger/strawberry blonde color changed to a light-medium brown/reddish color. A big improvement and closer to my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve only dyed my hair about 4 times, I decided to use the product again 60 hours later (with a deep conditioning in between). Now after following the instructions again, my hair is strawberry blonde yet again, and hopefully in 24 hours will be even closer to my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again, if you&#x27;re looking to get closer to your natural color, wait 24 hours before dyeing your hair again because the color will change over a 24 hour period.</li>
    <li> Alright so I had high hopes for this product (especially with taking semi-permanent hair color out) but it didn&#x27;t take all the dye out. I dyed my hair from a platinum blonde to a light brown with semi-permanent color over Thanksgiving , thinking that it will eventually wash out, but of course it didn&#x27;t. It turned into a dark blonde color, but I was starting to miss my platinum so I decided to give this a shot. It did NOT go back to my previous color, it went from dark blonde to a lighter blonde. Not bad but not as expected. One good thing though is that is didn&#x27;t leave any orange tint in my hair (I also used purple shampoo to wash this out with so not sure if it was that). The smell is horrible but that was expected after reading the other reviews, the only downside is that the smell lingered even after washing this out. Hopefully it will come out after another wash. I guess it&#x27;s worth a shot since it&#x27;s not damaging.</li>
    <li> This product was horrifying. I had dyed my hair and auburn color from a dark blonde/light brown natural color. When I used Color Oops, my hair turned YELLOW. Not blonde, definitely not my natural color, yellow. I followed the instructions carefully and only processed my hair for about 8-10 minutes. I rinsed my hair for about half an hour. Not really sure where I went wrong. It looks horrible though and I will need to dye it again later today :(</li>
    <li> I colored my hair too dark. Tried washing my hair and doing a hot oil treatment. Neither option worked. So I bought OOPS and it worked beautifully. The hardest part was rinsing for 20 min.</li>
    <li> I used it to remove my faded color hair, so I may be able to re-dye my hair without the darkening effect over my old color. Worked pretty well.</li>
    <li> This product saved my butt! I dyed my medium-brownish-reddish hair black. As in, permanent, jet black. I left this black dye in for about 3 weeks, and then got sick of it. I bought a box of this Color Oops Extra Strength, FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS (left on for 20 minutes in a warm-ish room, rinsed for 5 minutes, shampooed thoroughly, rinsed again for 5 minutes, shampooed, rinsed some more, conditioned) then followed up with a henna &amp; placenta mask to help my poor abused hair.    It took out ALL THE BLACK. Seriously. My normal colour is back again! My hair smells pretty awful and seems a tiny bit distressed, but some deep conditioning and a bit of time will help that.     This stuff might not help you if you have layers of different colours in your hair-- it&#x27;ll take off the top layer &amp; might be uneven. This stuff won&#x27;t help to remove direct color dye (those gaudy unnatural colours- pink, purple, blue, etc). This stuff won&#x27;t help you if you don&#x27;t follow the directions.    But it rocks my socks off! (And no, I don&#x27;t work for the company. I&#x27;m just some chick who bought a box of it in the drugstore)</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!! After researching all types of colour remover I settled on this one (primarily because it was available at my local drug store). It does stink, no doubt about that, but it&#x27;s not horrific, and as long as you use a pleasant smelling deep conditioner afterwards your hair should not smell like regurgitated rotten eggs. One disclaimer: my natural colour is dark brown (dyed it blue black for yeaaaars and wanted to return to my natural hair colour) so I&#x27;m not sure how this would work with lighter hair. I now kinda wish I had a before and after picture to show you, because I&#x27;m still shocked at how well it removed all the black. I originally bought two boxes (based on reviews and the instructions), but only used one - mind you, I&#x27;m mixed with unbelievably thick long hair, but I think because this stuff is like water it goes a long way and it REALLY saturated my hair. I would also recommend buying a deep conditioner for after - my hair doesn&#x27;t  feel/appear damaged, but it&#x27;s mad dry.   Never thought it would work this well!!!!</li>
    <li> ..........Because you&#x27;re going to be saying &amp;#34;OOPS!&amp;#34; after you decide to put this junk in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Backstory: I dyed my VIRGIN dirty blonde hair with a Dark Burgundy semi-permanent box dye. It was suppose to wash out in 28 washes but it never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to continue buying this dye and my roots were coming out so I decided to buy Color Oops after reading tons of reviews and watching tons of review videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just cut to the chase, this crap made my hair YELLOW AND ORANGE. I followed the instructions exactly, rinsed for OVER 20 minutes and scrubbed with shampoo until my hair became straw. Yes, it did take the dark burgundy out of my hair, but it DID NOT take me back to my natural color or anything close to it. On the box it says it&#x27;s suppose to take you back to your natural color, even shows a Before &amp; After pic on the box showing you. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have never bleached my hair or lightened it in any way, and now somehow my roots are DARKER than the rest of my head. It looks like I have a bad bleach job and forgot to tone it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what to do now. I can&#x27;t afford to go to a salon to correct this and I don&#x27;t know enough about hair to fix it myself! NEVER AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it smells like Satan&#x27;s booty mixed with eggs and is super runny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair since I started going gray at 17, so over 20 years now.  Every once in awhile I decide to change colors and make a mistake.  I made such a mistake about 2 weeks ago, the color came out way too dark.  I tried to just let it fade but it turned a very unattractive shade of brown.  I wanted my hair back to red before an upcoming trip.  I followed the directions exactly and it took all of the color off leaving my hair a strawberry blonde.  I then did a protein conditioner like the instructions suggested before coloring again.  My new color came out great. I was very impressed with this product.  My hair is in good shape and not dried out much at all.  I even showed the pictures to my hairdresser and she was impressed.</li>
    <li> So the consistency is roughly that of water, thus putting it on your hair without getting it on the floor, counter, clothes, etc. is nearly impossible.  I followed the instructions and rinsed for literally 30 minutes, and my normally brown hair is now orange.  Then there&#x27;s the horrible, horrible smell.  Seven hours after I used it all the doors and windows are open and still my son walks in and say, &amp;#34;Holy God, what is that rotten egg smell?!&amp;#34;  The product is difficult to use, requires a ridiculous amount of rinsing, and rather than lifting out the black dye has just turned my hair orange and created a smell that would repel a zombie horde.</li>
    <li> Was a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> As a little hair background, I naturally have extremly light brown hair with a little blonde mixed in. Think like, really, really dirty blonde haha. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for like 4 years straight maybe so my hair has seen a lot of different colors. It&#x27;s been blue, pink, black like a thousand shades of red and stuff so I assumed it would MAYBE be able to help a little. For the first time in forever I saw my natural color and of course the areas I had bleached were returned to that shade. I&#x27;m extremly impressed. I want to have my hair white and with pastel green bangs next so I wanted to bleach my hair but I didn&#x27;t want to have the let the bleach also work on counteracting the dyes I&#x27;ve used so this was a great solution. I won&#x27;t have to leave the bleach on nearly as long and it won&#x27;t look as uneven as it would if I hadn&#x27;t used this! Oh and just so you know I didn&#x27;t follow all the directions. I just mixed them together, stuck it in my hair for maybe 22-25 minutes then I hopped in the shower and just scrubbed my hair with the Green Tea Conditioner by Paul Mitchell for like 15 minutes then once more for a second to help with the smell. Then I used a different conditioner to compinsate for any dryness from using this product. You don&#x27;t have to actually do the whole 5 minute chunk things. At least I didn&#x27;t. Anyway, BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as expected. There was very little color fading so I waited a week or so and tried again. There was a perceptible lightening of color, but nowhere near what I expected. And I discovered that the sulfur / smell seems to linger after washing several Washings.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my experience. I had bleached blonde hair for years. Then decided to dye it brown and had that for a few months. Then for some stupid reason I went black. I hated it. A week later I tried this product. I bought it from Walmart for $8.95. Followed instructions to the T and got a reddish color after it. I kind of like it. Better than black I think. There was no hair damage. The product does have a rotten egg mix with flowers smell. It&#x27;s a bit weird but after bleaching my hair for years this smell didn&#x27;t bother me. Smell did washed out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I took a star off because I really expected this to work on Kool Aid dyed hair. It does not. We dipped both of our daughter&#x27;s hair in cherry Kool Aid. 6 months later....it&#x27;s still there. We ended up using a regular hair color to color over it, it toned it down a lot but you can tell it is still there. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> I tried dying my hair back to it&#x27;s natural dark brown color and it turned out completely black with weird burgundy undertones. For reference, prior to dying it black I had lightened my hair with a medium ash brown color (no bleach was used). I figured using color oops would return my hair close to that medium ash brown color. I left it on for only 5 minutes as opposed to the recommended 20+ minutes because my hair is short and seems to hold/release color easily. When I rinsed off the product, I was left with my lighter hair color but with very brassy/red tones. I was happy that this product worked, but I expected this to happen. So I purchased another hair dye but this time a lighter color and different brand. My hair turned out perfect. It was a cool dark brown. No more black and burgundy undertones! As for smell, it smells just like sulfur (rotten eggs, smelly feet, vinegar, with a slightly acidic orange scent). Do not throw this in the trash in your house, it will reek! Keep it outside!</li>
    <li> Where do I start with this product? I&#x27;m a natural brunette and I had recently dyed my hair a dark shade of purple that I hated. I waited a few days to see if it would fade into a shade of purple that I liked better, but it did not so I decided it was time to get rid of it. I read plenty of reviews on this product and saw that it was pretty good so I gave it a shot. First of all, the smell is terrible and clings to your hair even after a few washes. It says on the box &#x27;bleach and ammonia free&#x27;. That&#x27;s a big fat lie. After I used this product I became a blonde. It bleached my hair and I absolutely hate it. I&#x27;m seriously considering cutting it all off and starting over because I want my natural color back.</li>
    <li> First - the smell is not that bad. I think folks are being dramatic. It reminds me of the smell of a perm. Second - this stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.  It took jet black streaks out of my light brown/blonde hair.  Now it looks like subtle lowlights.  I&#x27;m so very happy. Easy to use and quick.</li>
    <li> I use two bottles of this color remover because my hair is long&lt;br /&gt;work for me so good, the only thing and (this is all my fault) let the product&lt;br /&gt;more time to the manual say (like 15 min) and my hair have a kind red color I dont care&lt;br /&gt;because the color I put on is red so my new color look  great, remember results depend&lt;br /&gt;on your natural color and are damaged or not and etc</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair for many, many, many years &#x27;darkest brown,&amp;#34; which has black in it. There for, I cannot go lighter without either growing my hair out (no thanks- too much grey!) or having it stripped out somehow. I have had this done in the salon a few times... at an extremely high cost. Simply not an option now. First I went to the beauty supply store and got a different product called Color Zapp! and it was a nightmare. It claims not to lighten your natural hair color, but it soon became apparent to me that this was basically BLEACH. When I rinsed it out, my roots were bright orange, I had huge stripes of black all over my head, and the ends were blond... not to mention fried! For two days, I had to wear a scarf on my head to hide the freak show underneath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In incredible distress, I looked to the internets for a solution and it was not until then that I learned of Color Oops. After reading many of the reviews here on Amazon, I was confident that this would be a gentler way to finish the job before I color it red for the summer. Well I got my box, used as directed and was very very please with the results. My hair is basically orange now because of the color zapp, but light enough that I can now recolor it a deep red. PLEASE READ: If you have not bleached your hair immediately prior to using Color Oops, your hair won&#x27;t turn orange like mine did! This is all the fault of Color Zapp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is very important to take seriously the recommendation that you spend 15-20 minutes just rinsing. This is for two reasons: if you do not rinse long enough, the chemical reaction that allows the pigment to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; can reverse itself and you will be back at some form of square one. The other reason is that this product contains high levels of sulfur, which smells nasty. I am prone to headaches from strong smells like this. Unfortunately. even with 20 minutes of rinsing, the smell is still there. I put a leave-in conditioner in that has a pleasant, mild fragrance. It is much more bearable. And it is repairing the damage done by the bleach concoction I first used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am a happy camper now. I will use this product in the future most definitely. I have very long hair (middle of back), but thin hair (due to both genetics and a recent hypothyroid diagnosis). One bottle was more than enough for me, but thick hair may need 2-3 bottles. There are still a few small areas where the black pigment was not successfully removed, but they are so minor, they will likely not be noticeable once I color my hair to the red. Overall, a great product with better-than-expected results. Will use again and again in the future.a pleasant, mild fragrance. It is much more bearable. And it is repairing the damage done by the bleach concoction I first used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am a happy camper now. I will use this product in the future most definitely. I have very long hair (middle of back), but thin hair (due to both genetics and a recent hypothyroid diagnosis). One bottle was more than enough for me, but thick hair may need 2-3 bottles.

    <li> Let me start by giving a brief history of my hair! I&#x27;m a natural dirty blonde, who grew tired of her hair color and decide to change it up. I dyed it a medium brown, which ended up turning to dark brown almost black. I lived with it for awhile, but decided that since my blonde roots were having such a hard time excepting the dark dye, that I was going to attempt to go back to blonde. My plan was always to bleach, but in an attempt to minimize the damage, I thought I would try to remove some of the color so I could use a lower developer for less time.&lt;br /&gt;I read countless reviews on this product( some good and some bad), but I figured \\&quot;what the hey!\\&quot;So, I bought two boxes if color oops  and tried it. Well, it did lighten up a little, but nowhere near to my natural color. So I did it again..and again...and again...and finally, again! I used this product 5 times in the course of 3 days, and I had achieved a red orange color that I was pleased with (I was gonna bleach anyway in a few weeks, and thought I would have no problem getting to a pale blonde from this stage)&lt;br /&gt;Well a few days after the last application, I washed my hair...just regular shampoo, I had not re-dyed or put anything containing  peroxide(that&#x27;s a no-no after color oops) on my head. I dried my hair, and to my not-so-pleasant surprise, parts of it had re-oxidized(meaning gone back to dark, but if you&#x27;re contemplating using this stuff,you&#x27;ve probably read about it quite a bit and knew what that meant!)&lt;br /&gt;After 5 applications, a lot of money, and a lot of having to deal with a horrific smell, I was left with orange blonde roots, dark brown in the middle, and red orange ends.I followed the instructions to the t, and even though the instructions say you can re dye afterward, I did not...yet still ended up nearly back to where I started.&lt;br /&gt;Had I written this review right after the applications(like I&#x27;m guessing most people do), I would&#x27;ve been singing its praises. However I waited, and fortunately am able to give a thorough review so others don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to go lighter...deep condition and go the sure fire route...bleach. this stuff smells terrible, and is such a pain to use. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did on a product that \\&quot;may or may not\\&quot; work for you. Its not worth it, its been weeks and my hair still smells like sulfur! Good luck everyone, I really hope this helps!am able to give a thorough review so others don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to go lighter...deep condition and go the sure fire route...bleach. this stuff smells terrible, and is such a pain to use.

    <li> Almost killed me and my whole family, I used this products and the whole house smelled of rotten eggs. Then my husband started vomiting uncontrollably, my baby was actually awoken by the smell and immediately started to scream. I had to sleep outside for a week.</li>
    <li> Works great. Stinks SO BAD though. It&#x27;s unlike something I have ever smelled. I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t fumigate my entire apartment.</li>
    <li> IT DOESNT WORK, AND MAKES YOUR HAIR SMELL LIKE ROTTEN EGGS FOR TWO WEEKS. WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I was trying to get my hair to a bleachable state to dye it purple. Well, overall, this product did well enough! It got a fair bit of the previous color out, a red, that I had been using for a year. Under that was a brown/blonde shade. It turned out as a strawberry blonde, though dark strawberry blonde. It smelled horrible, but not as bad as previous reviews had said it would. THe test strands turned out better than what rest of my head did, but it happens.</li>
    <li> I wanted to remove hair color, go back to natural.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with brassy color.&lt;br /&gt;Very unhappy !&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to recolor my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I might have too.</li>
    <li> I have natural dark red hair...several months ago I tried blonde highlights and I hated them - they stripped the red look and I went to a salon today to get it fixed. The stylist gave me dark dark brown hair with a tiny bit of red - it looked synthetic and I was in tears. On a friend&#x27;s suggestion, I got a box of Color Oops and spent 20 minutes letting it soak in then a further 30 minutes rinsing - I was doubtful but I have to say that after that time, my hair was frizzy and felt stripped but the red was back and the color was gone. I am thrilled. This was a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions implicitly, I&#x27;m that kind of girl. It did strip the color, which is awesome, but my hair is in terrible condition with tons of breakage -- I&#x27;m talking major breakage. I only had a small section that was colored in the front with regular medium-brown dye and a bit throughout the ends. My natural hair is still in good condition, but any areas that were previously colored are dry and brittle. I&#x27;m only praying all of those areas don&#x27;t break, because that would make the whole ordeal pretty pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a &amp;#34;try just for the fun of it&amp;#34; kind of product. If you&#x27;re desperate, give it a go. If you have super-strong hair, you could probably get away with it, too, with tons of conditioning. If you have fine hair like I do, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless absolutely necessary.</li>
    <li> I had dyed my hair red and hated it so I read about this stuff and there were more good reviews than bad so I decided to try it. It did take most of the color out off my hair in about 13 minutes. After that time I saw a bald spot about the size of a nickel so I started rinsing it out. I just came from my hair stylist and she found another bald spot further back that I didn&#x27;t see about the same size.&lt;br /&gt;I mean there is NO hair in those spots, completely smooth spots on my head. I will never use it again!</li>
    <li> It smells awful and didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have naturally dark blonde/light brown hair that I&#x27;ve gotten highlighted at a salon for the past 6 years. I used this to try to remove an orangey box color I used on a whim at home, and all it did was lighten my hair to a lighter orange color. It also smells TERRIBLE! Luckily I&#x27;m getting my hair done professionally at the salon next week so she can fix this but it didn&#x27;t work and made my hair even worse.</li>
    <li> Thank god this product is available to buy and for delivery. I needed to strip my hair of an ugly dark color it turned my hair back to the color it was meant to be. Thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> It says it removes permanent hair dye from hair.. I used it to remove a black and it left streaks of black.. would recommend for a lighter hair color</li>
    <li> I have naturally light blonde hair and occasionally put bright red sections ( with permanent salon dye) through my bangs and section in the back.  Red does not come out easily, or cover easily, in my experience.  This time when I was sick of the red, and it was fading to an icky brassy color I decided to try Color Oops because it was one of the few things I hadn&#x27;t tried to remove red from my blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions were straight forward and easy to follow.  The smell was gross, but bearable.  The solution is pretty watery, so it was helpful for me to have someone help put it on the back sections of my hair so I didn&#x27;t make a huge mess. The results were just okay.  Not great, but not terrible.  You have to rinse your hair for a very long time, and I actually ran out of hot water in the process.  At the end of it all I had a faded pink tone where the red was.  So, it faded it a significant amount, but by no means removed it.  Also, as others have said it did darken some as the day went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the biggest bummer with using this is that my hair is noticeably damaged after using it.  I have fine, soft hair, and this was very drying, and caused some frizz and damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the damage, and just okay results this is not something I would probably use again.  I have read though that it works best for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; colors, so that may be part of why I got the results I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a side note for the other blondes out there who are trying to get red out, in my experience the red just has to be blended until it fades out and/or grows out and can be cut off.  Most of the things I&#x27;ve done to try to remove the red have just fade it.  I&#x27;ve even had a salon put brown on top to try and cover it and it didn&#x27;t take completely.  This last time I tried putting a dark blonde over the pink and it came out a mauve color.  It&#x27;s been an adventure for sure. Just remember, it&#x27;s hair, it will grow out eventually.</li>
    <li> I could be the exception to the amazing ratings that this product got. In fact, it was because of all of these amazing ratings that I decided to try it for myself. I have natural golden blonde hair and I decided to dye my hair a chocolate red/brown. When I realized that I needed to take it out, I saw a review about Color Oops that had similar features of my symptoms so I bought it. I read the instructions and completed them in order and like I should. THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK ON MY HAIR. Not only is my hair still dark it smells HORRIBLE like a vomity/vineagary smell so pungent my whole office has noticed. I tried this product yesterday (monday) and have washed it at least three times with smelly shampoo and they SMELL IS STILL THERE. I will not be buying this product again and I do not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist and I purchased this to test it out on myself before using it on my client. I followed all instructions to-the-letter and the product did NOT produce any results, at all. The rinsing step I did for more than 40 minutes with hot water and still no color was lifted.&lt;br /&gt;So I used the second box, again, no results. The amount of negative reviews should have been a deterrent for me but I figured I would try it on my brown hair that was colored to black as I have been coloring hair professionally for 20 years. It did not lift the black out at all. This product stinks, both literally and physically. The smell has not left my bathroom after 4 days. This may work on very lightly dyed hair but it will not work on dark colors that were applied to already dark hair.</li>
    <li> Alright so I was terrified to use this product...to start out, I got pregnant and didn&#x27;t dye my hair for a year and 3 months. Right when I got pregnant it was a pretty red that I loved but over the course of not dying it it faded to a yellowish color which I was not happy with. I was determined not to dye my hair as it was half my natural and getting really long. But it got to a point where I couldn&#x27;t stand the yellow anymore. So I decided its time to change it up. Because it was either that or cutt it to where my natural color ended which wasn&#x27;t an option, been growin my hair out for so long. So I wanted to get the red I had before back. But I eventually want my natural so I wanted something that I didn&#x27;t think would turn to yellow so I can dye it out. So I tried a reddish auburn brown which turned my hair bright red. It was awful! I was so embarrassed to even go to the store. I read all kinda of reviews about color oops and decided I didn&#x27;t have another choice. I used it and I am very glad I did. My hair is definitely not back to my natural but it faded the red so much I can dye it a light natural brown, which hopefully won&#x27;t fade while I keep growin my hair out. The best advice I could give is to not dye hair. It is so much more beautiful natural whatever the color. But if you decide to and it doesn&#x27;t turn out I highly recommend color oops. Just have extra hair dye on hand in case it turns out like mine, not quite your natural. And be sure to read the instructions all the way and understand them before you start. Very important! I had no hair loss problems or blotchyness as I did exactly what it said.</li>
    <li> I bought Color Oops after dying my light blonde hair a darker blonde, which turned it a terrible ashy, almost green brown as my hair was so porous. Nothing was working to help fade the color (clarifying shampoo, hot oil, etc.) I followed the directions, which instructed me to rinse my hair like crazy (15-20 minutes) followed by shampoo, more rinsing, and a good conditioner. At first my hair was back to blonde...a nice medium, almost golden blonde. Then during the past two weeks since using the treatment, it has gotten gradually darker...now settled into a dark blonde, pretty close to what was on the box of color that I had purchased. Apparently if you don&#x27;t rinse away all of the shrunken color molecules, they can turn the hair darker again. At least it&#x27;s not as dark as I started out with, but I wasn&#x27;t about to spend an hour with my head under the bathtub faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it stinks--literally. Like a burnt rubber/latex. It&#x27;s been two weeks and I can still smell a trace of it in my hair when I wash it. At this point I plan on letting some of my natural color grow in and will let this current color fade/wash out as much as possible before going back to my lighter blonde color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my own fault for messing around with my hair color, but I&#x27;m disappointed in the product. There used to be an odorless, completely gentle, vegetable-based powder from Europe that you would mix with water, apply to hair, wrap in plastic and heat activate...but sadly, I could find NO info about it online...maybe it&#x27;s not made anymore, which is a shame, as that stuff worked perfectly and left no smell whatsoever.</li>
    <li> First off, my natural hair color is a dark brown and I&#x27;ve been bleaching it for over a year now. Recently I dyed just the ends of my hair a dark blue and by now its faded to an ugly green - blue that just won&#x27;t go away. Since the package says that this isn&#x27;t made for pinks, blues, greens, etc., I didn&#x27;t even think it would work but decided to try anyways. One main concern was that it would make my hair brown or somewhat brown again. I was very pleased when, after the full 20 minutes I found it had completely removed the green from my hair and left it looking brand new blonde again. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking to change hair colors.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair first on a Saturday and then again on a Monday. After Monday&#x27;s dying, I realized I didn&#x27;t like the color- I thought it was too dark. I wanted my hair to be its original color before I dyed it on Saturday. I have had Color Oops in my closet for close to three years now...I got it out, did the strand test (didn&#x27;t want my hair to turn green or fall out!), and then applied it to my whole head. I left it on for seven minutes (it was pretty easy to apply solo), and then followed the directions for shampooing and rinsing. It got my hair back to the color it was after Saturday&#x27;s dying- which is what the box says it will do. It says to use 1 Color Oops for each dying. I am going to get some more tomorrow and do it again to hopefully have my original color back. It worked, and my hair isn&#x27;t a funky color!</li>
    <li> I get my hair professionally dyed by a close friend. Problem number one. After a year of having my natural mousey brown hair weaved with blonde I&#x27;ve noticed my hair getting a lot more fly away ends and my hair losing it&#x27;s shine. I&#x27;m done with the coloring! So the last two appointments I&#x27;ve asked for more brown to be weaved into my hair so that I could get back to my natural color and be done with all of this. Well, this time I asked to go darker...and something got lost in the communication between the two of us. I was asked to pick out a color from a swatch. I choose one and also pointed out a person in the salon with the color I really liked, a medium brown. I then told my friend that I don&#x27;t want any red tones in my hair. Well, next thing I know a bottle of medium brown dye is put on all over my head, straight on, no foils. I wasn&#x27;t worried cause I liked the color in the bottle and since I&#x27;m not the professional I didn&#x27;t feel I need to question this new process. Problem number two. After some wait time, the next thing I know I&#x27;m rinsed out and looking at my new color in the mirror. It was sooo dark. Not the medium brown in the bottle or the color of the person&#x27;s hair I picked out. I was told that it would fade with washing. This I knew was true cause my last coloring faded and that&#x27;s why I wanted to go darker this time. Well, not pleased with the results at that time, but not really pleased with the NEW results when I got home. You see by the time I got home from the salon, my hair had turned BLACK! At first I thought it was the low lights in my house. Well, I noticed my head was itching. So much so that I just couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and had to wash my hair. Sure enough the water and shampoo were black! I don&#x27;t know what happened, but I really believe that the product wasn&#x27;t rinsed out enough at the salon. After no sleep that night and searching on the internet for advice I came across Color Oops! Yeah, I would say my color was an oops! I had my husband go tothe store the next morning and buy me the regular strength. My hair was already damaged, so I didn&#x27;t want to pick the extra strength just in case it damaged it more. It didn&#x27;t and it actually took the black tint out. Still really, really dark brown, but not black at least. I tried to live with that for a day. I just couldn&#x27;t. Way too dark for my skin tone, looks like I&#x27;m wearing a wig. So I went to the store to buy the extra strength Color Oops. At this point I was desperate! This lightened it another shade, but now it&#x27;s a very dark auburn red. Problem number three. I didn&#x27;t want red! A pretty color, but not on me!!! It&#x27;s been three more days and now I&#x27;m going to get some advice from a professional. Color Oops worked for me a little bit. I&#x27;m happier with this color than the black, but I wished it worked more like it claims on the box. I know black is the hardest color to remove, so I would recommend this product for that fact. Well worth the money and time. At least with this color I can leave my house and go out in public. Just as long as I don&#x27;t run into anyone I know!</li>
    <li> This works great and it didnt turn my hair orange  like the loreal brand did. My hair was dyed a really dark brown and this stuff was able to take it back to blonde maybe a lil bit lighter than my natural color but close enough.</li>
    <li> I had my hair dyed professionally about 6 weeks ago. She put slices of black throughout and I have absolutely hated it. I tried to dye my roots to a dark brown (I have naturally dark blonde hair) and they turned ORANGE! I went to Walgreens and bought this product. It actually removed the black from my hair! The roots were no longer orange but a nasty yellowish blonde. I dyed my hair with a medium ash brown color and left the dye in for only 10 minutes. It is now a very dark beautiful color. If it weren&#x27;t for this product I would be walking around looking like a candy corn....black and orange! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, all that effort and I&#x27;m right back where I started. My natural hair is med ashy blonde but I&#x27;ve been getting low lights and high lights for 10 years. The highlighted areas were damaged, the lowlights never lasted, and I was paying a fortune at the salon so, a few months ago, I decided to take a break from the salon and go darker using a semi-perm light brown. I loved the results but the semi-perm colors faded quickly so I tried a permanent light brown a few weeks ago. It looked great at first but also faded fast and with an unflattering reddish tint. Also, it looks funny when the blonde roots grow in against the brown. So I decided going darker is just as high maintenance as blonde and want to go back to blonde but don&#x27;t want to damage my hair.    After reading the reviews, I bought the extra strength colors oops, read the directions thoroughly and followed them carefully. Before starting, I turned the AC off so the temperature in the bathroom was in the high 70&#x27;s with no drafts. Like most people have said, the stuff smells of rotten eggs, similar in intensity to a perm, and is very watery and messy and it will spray out of the bottle if you shake it so aim away from your face. My hair is long and fine and one box was just enough to saturate it. I put a lightweight shower cap on and left it on for the full 20 minutes. When I took the cap off, it looked much lighter. I rinsed and shampooed repeatedly in very warm water for longer than the directions specified (45 mins total). By the end, I was shriveled like a prune and thought I might pass out from the heat. Then I used a deep conditioner and left it on for 15 mins while wearing another shower cap. After rinsing the conditioner out and towel drying, my hair appeared to be a nice medium blonde shade and I was thinking I might not even have to use the blonde semi-perm color I bought. My hair still felt somewhat dry so I used a hot oil treatment, followed up with another round of deep conditioner andrinsing. After all that, I let it air dry and practically cried the next time I looked in the mirror. Its exactly the same color it was before Color Oops. I wasted $20, 3 hours and stunk up my house and hair for nothing. The only positive thing I can say is that I don&#x27;t think it worsened the condition of my hair and the nasty smell didn&#x27;t cling to my hair...it smelled normal by the time I got out of the shower. I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work for me. My hair is dry and has always taken color fast for what that&#x27;s worth. Now I&#x27;m debating whether I should try some of the other color removers that are available or just suck it up and have it stripped at the salon. Or maybe I should stick with the sickly reddish color and freaky blonde roots until it grows out?  Hmm, decisions, decisions...    THE MORNING AFTER UPDATE - After sleeping on it, I&#x27;ve changed my review from 1 to 2 stars because, after giving it a day, my hair is now about a shade lighter than when I started. It still has a lot of color on it and is not close to what I expected or want but it is lighter. Unfortunately, now its a sickly pale red that is worse than the light brown I started with. I&#x27;m going to put on a baseball cap and head to the store for another box and I think this time I&#x27;ll leave it on a bit longer and I&#x27;ll rinse as long as possible. I rinsed until I ran out of hot water yesterday so I&#x27;m not sure I can do much better than that. I&#x27;ll post an update after the next round.    AFTER BOX #2 - I changed my review back to 1 star. The 1st box lightened my hair one shade and didn&#x27;t hurt the condition of my hair so the next day I applied a 2nd box, left it on 20 minutes w/ a showercap, rinsed for an HOUR until the water ran cold. All artificial color was removed from my roots and they were the pale blonde shade I was expecting; however, the rest of my hair remained a hideous pale red, with the ends being darker than the middle. My hair was also extremely brittle. I applied two hot oil treatments hopingthat might lighten it further while restoring moisture. My hair felt better but wasn&#x27;t any lighter. So I admitted defeat and started calling friends for recommendations of local colorists. First thing Monday morning I tucked my tail between my legs and went to the salon where I ended up spending plenty of time and money. I didn&#x27;t want to risk breakage by using bleach so I opted to go darker than the medium blonde I was aiming for. After having a filler applied, my roots dyed darker, a medium beige blonde applied all over, a few foil highlights on top and an allover gloss, my hair is light caramel brown w/ beige blond highlights and looks very nice. I will never stray from the salon again.     -  BOTTOM LINE - if your hair is in really good shape and you&#x27;re only looking to go a shade lighter, this stuff will probably do the trick but if you&#x27;ve colored your hair repeatedly or need to lighten several shades, I&#x27;d recommend going to the salon. Also, I do NOT have asthma but this stuff gave me a hacking cough and made my nose run both times that I used it even though I was in a large bathroom with an exhaust fan. I was still coughing a day later - and when I coughed, I could taste that rotten egg smell. Gross and probably not healthy so use with caution.</li>
    <li> Alright, so a little back story for ya, I&#x27;m 21 years old who has NEVER dyed her hair before. I decided, hey, time for a change! Let&#x27;s try ombre. Specifically light brown(natural color) to blonde at tips. Well, my hairdresser I guess didn&#x27;t get the idea i was thinking of from the 30 pictures i showed her, but that&#x27;s besides the point. It ended up being basically blonde from a couple inches from my scalp to my tips so i had her re-dye it back to my natural hair color yesterday and she dyed it BLACK. Like, black as black and no offense to anyone with black hair, but that&#x27;s just not me. at all. So here I am looking like a big weirdo with black hair. This product had great reviews online, some bad some good, as you could probably tell because I&#x27;m probably one of 20 you just read. My hair is long (about mid way down my back) and thick so I prepared two bottles and i ended up used 100% of one bottle and 50% of the other. Definitely do a test strand first! I cut a chunk of hair off in the middle of my head on the one side(the least obvious place) and when i was finished with the test, I was very pleased with the color. On a side note, I just left the test strand in the sink. I didn&#x27;t put it in the sun or near a heater or anything. My house is probably 67-70 degrees right now. The only reason I&#x27;m sharing this is because it&#x27;s VERY important that you are extremely consistent. If you leave your test strand in the sink, just bend over and leave your hair in the tub for as long as you can stand it. You WILL get different results if your test strand is in the heat, washed for 2 minutes, shampoo, etc. and then when you treat your head, it&#x27;s cold water, rinse for 5 minutes, etc. so make sure if you do anything, it&#x27;s stay consistent so the results you see on the test strand is exactly what your whole head will look like. Make sure you time it too! It&#x27;s recommended for 20 minutes but everyone on the reviews seems to steer you away from that time. Personally, I figured I&#x27;d rather haveit in for not long enough than too long so I went with 10 minutes for the test strand and 8 minutes when I covered my entire head(left 2 minutes for application time so i stayed consistent with 10 mins). Do the skin test too! It sounds dumb, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine dumping this all over my head and then having my scalp develop an allergic reaction. That just sounds like hell to me. Alright, so I dumped it all over my head and it says to use a comb to make sure it is evenly spread out, but my hair got really knotted from all that I was doing to it so I just made sure that I soaked my hair to the very core because there was no way I was getting a comb through it.  All of the reviews say that rinsing is the most important part, but don&#x27;t freak out if your rinsing your hair and your hot water only stays on for 10 minutes. That&#x27;s what happened to me and it came out fine. Just wash it for 20 if you can or until your water gets kind of cold. As you&#x27;ll probably be able to feel, your hair gets tough because of all the rinsing so I put in conditioner and let it sit in until I had hot water again (10-20 minutes). Another side note, I&#x27;m not sure if some peoples noses are just more delicate than mine, but I do not agree with what everyone is saying about the smell. Yes, it is a little overwhelming when your applying it, but that&#x27;s because you&#x27;re using an ENTIRE bottle of it and assuming your hair is flipped over in the tub, it&#x27;s RIGHT next to your nose and eyes so it&#x27;s going to be very strong. I obviously did it in my bathroom and I had the window wide open and about 5 minutes after rinsing, I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all. My hair kind of smells like it, but  after I shower again tomorrow, I&#x27;m 100% sure the smell will be nonexistent. End results!! My hair looks almost exactly how it looked in the good ol&#x27; days before I went on pinterest and decided that ombre was for me. I will never dye my hair again, and this product is the closest thing you will get to time-traveling back in timeand slapping yourself right in the face for ever doing whatever you did to your already perfect hair color. Good luck to your hair dying adventures and remember, Hair test, skin test, be consistent, rinse, time!</li>
    <li> Having long extremely thick hair makes going to a salon insanely unaffordable. After reading what seem like a million reviews, I gave in a tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweaty balls and semen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ohhhhh my gosh. I&#x27;ve covered my head in sweaty balls and not a man in sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no other way to describe the gag reflex inducing odor that&#x27;s radiating from my head after applying this. Honestly my ex&#x27;s balls smelled better than this after he worked all day in the heat and then played softball. No kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not work on salon color.</li>
    <li> followed directions to a t.  read that it will not take out highlights if choice was to go lighter. okay. no big deal. however, it did state that it would take out the unintended tones (e.g., brassy). if anything, it made my hair an even darker red. perhaps a decent product for individuals who went from light to dark, but not appropriate (and a total waste of money) for people that are light brown/blonde who switched to a lighter tone. this didn&#x27;t change anything, well...perhaps it made it even more brassy! not for blondes.</li>
    <li> I used this product to lighten my hair which was dyed blue-black for several years. I wanted to go to a dark brown. I did not expect this product to return my hair to its natural and I was right. It went to a reddish uneven light brown. But this is actually amazing and what I wanted. It also didn&#x27;t fry my hair (as straight bleach would&#x27;ve) im now able to dye my hair an even dark brown which wouldve been impossible without an intermediary step, the color remover. If you approach this product with reasonable expectations its the best home product on the market for getting black dye out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But! It smells awful and has the consistency of snot. I almost vomited, use ventilation when applying, seriously.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!!! Dyed my hair red, but it was too bright for me. Wanted to go back blonde without bleaching. It is now a beautiful strawberry/honey blonde. Smells horrible, like vinegar but works great!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was perfect!  I freaked out after we had a couple glasses of wine and my neighbor colored our hair.  I have thinning hair and it the jet black color looked like someone took shoe polish to my scalp!  I could not go to work tomorrow like that!  So my niece who is a colorist suggested this product.  It was an emergency, so I found it locally after reading the reviews on Amazon.  I followed the directions to the letter, and it worked perfectly. It removed the added color from my hair and scalp.  Took about 35 minutes and yes, it does have a strong odor.  But it was worth it!</li>
    <li> It removed all my hair color thankfully, the only downside is the smell itself is terrible. It was mega hard to get the smell out of my hair, overall It worked great for removing all the previous colors and it didn&#x27;t make my hair brassy. A good product.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a lot more from this products, going by it&#x27;s reviews. I guess you can&#x27;t even trust some people&#x27;s reviews these days</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. Follow the directions and it works great. I tried a red color and it was blotchy and awful. I used Oops exactly as directed and then re-dyed my hair with my old favorite color the same night. It came out perfect.</li>
    <li> The most disgusting smelling product ever the box was damaged and looked really old and it did not do as said my hair just got lighter it didn&#x27;t take out the hair dye and it left my hair brittle boooooo</li>
    <li> I love this Color Oops. I have used it multiple times and had excellent results. I usually just leave my hair the copper color and do not re-dye my hair. I have dyed my hair black and it brings it to the copper color every time. If you leave the copper color and do not re-dye within a few days the copper starts to subside and your hair tones out to a brown.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this color remover! It will not do as good of a job as if you were to just go spend a little money at a salon! It is well worth your money to have your hair looking tip top. This product unfortuneately is just a smelly, disgusting waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> After my last coloring extravaganza, the color I chose decided to turn my hair purple!! In my younger years I wouldn&#x27;t have minded so much, but at 23 I need to be a little bit more professional and purple hair didn&#x27;t make the cut. I stumbled across Color Oops in my local Rite Aid and decided to give it a try. Only after I purchased the product did I begin to read reviews. DEFINITELY do a strand test. I cut a tiny strand from an inconspicuous place to test. If you have colored your hair more than once Color Oops will not remove all the color, saying it will only remove the most recent application. However, I know it removed more than just the most recent color. My hair came out its natural color at the roots and a medium to light auburn on the length. (Probably since most of the colors I choose have a lot of red in them.) Your hair WILL darken in the first 24 hours after use. So don&#x27;t freak out if it&#x27;s too light right after like I did. This is not a miracle product but did work as stated on the box. It does dry out your hair, but not nearly as bad as going to a pro and having it stripped or bleached. A heavy conditioner and a good leave-in are essential to have after application. I actually like the color it came out and do not plan on re-dying for a while. Would definitely use this product again if needed.</li>
    <li> This works, but be sure to follow the directions EXACTLY... for example, if it tells you to RINSE your hair in the shower for 20 minutes, RINSE IT FOR 20 MINUTES.. not 18 minutes, etc.. this is a very important step, because when you are in the shower rinsing this stuff out of your hair, THATS when its really doing its job, and the cuticle of your hair is open, and THATS when all of the MOLECULES OF COLOR ( the color you hate and are trying to get rid of ) are being washed out of your hair.. so if you just give it a half hearted rinse, it may look ok for a day or two, but then, by the 3rd day, your hair will start to somewhat darken again because the cuticle has closed back up-- closed back up around those molecules of color that you hated and wanted to get rid of -- because you didnt spend enough time rinsing your hair. Follow the directions *EXACTLY*, even if some of the steps seem un-needed, and you should be happy with the results. It worked great for me, and I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally medium brown hair, but I&#x27;ve been dying it dark brown/black for at least a year now. This week I noticed that my roots were starting to come in, but I was getting tired of black hair, so I decided to go red. In order to do this I had to strip out all of the black hair dye build up. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work, but I figured I&#x27;d try it since it got good reviews. It smelled like rotten eggs [there&#x27;s some kind of sulfate in it], but my hair is back to a color I haven&#x27;t seen since high school. There&#x27;s no damage to speak of, my hair feels like it always does. I definitely recommend it, even if you&#x27;ve had dye in your hair for a really long time like I did.</li>
    <li> This product really helped progress from a dark red to my natural blonde color fast. I had been dyed g my hair red for about 2 years and here are my results after one use....My hairdresser had never hear of color oops, but it worked great for me and my mission to return to a natural blonde color.</li>
    <li> Naturally dirty blonde, dyed dark brown- almost black. I used one application, and I left on for about 35 minutes instead of 20.</li>
    <li> I have light brown hair and decided to go red one day when I was bored. I kept it for about a year, but dying was becoming a process I didn&#x27;t want to deal with...nor did I really want to deal with the more bothersome choices I had for removing the red so I decided to try color oops. Worked really well after only one application. Followed the directions on the box exactly, used full 20 minute processing time and rinsed thoroughly. Very pleased with my hair now. No more touch ups for me.</li>
    <li> made my hair and room stink like rotten eggs for over a month!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product over henna and indigo (hendigo). This product IS NOT technically meant for this type of a dye. However, quite a few users on various hair forums had attempted it in order to try to get out their henna or hendigo, so I tried it as well. But I want to be clear that the product outright states that it is not for this type of colorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did get out some of the color. My hair was a darkest brown/black (not blue-black). It lifted to a medium brown and was not patchy or odd-looking at all. BEWARE hendigo users: I can clearly see that it lifted much more of the henna than the indigo. If I were to repeat applications I believe I&#x27;d wind up with bluish or greenish hair, as there would be more indigo left than henna (or perhaps no henna, and just indigo). Indigo is just the color it says, indigo. :D purplish-blue. If you&#x27;re going to attempt something like this as I did, you could wind up with bluish, bluish-gray or greenish hair, so be ready for that. The usual fix would be to apply yellow-toned color if your hair turns blue, or reddish-toned color if your hair turns green (go opposite on the color wheel to tone down any given color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stars off are not for the fact that it didn&#x27;t remove all of my color. That would be unfair as the product was not meant for this type of color in the first place. Rather, the stars off are for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The smell. I understand that it&#x27;s a sulfur-based product, but I&#x27;m surprised that, given the technology it took to make this product, there couldn&#x27;t also be some technology to tone down the smell. The smell remained in my house for several days even with all my windows open, and was overpowering. DON&#x27;T throw away the bottles, cap, etc. inside the house. Take them right out of the house and dispose of them in your outdoor garbage can. These WILL NOT tone down in smell over time and if you get them on your garbage can, you&#x27;ll have to wash out your garbage can. The smell remained strong in my hair until my first COing (conditioner-only washing), then reappeared each time I wet my hair for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Burning/irritation. I definitely got burning using this product. I literally had red burns on my ears and on my neck. I don&#x27;t know if I technically have any burns on my scalp but I know that I have a burning feeling overall on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The rinse time. Again, given that some technology went into making this product, I&#x27;m wondering why there hasn&#x27;t been some advance in how long the hair must be rinsed. Even if it&#x27;s literally impossible to accomplish such a thing, I feel a star off is in order as the rinsing time will definitely get on some people&#x27;s nerves and will use up A LOT of water, so be warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t regret using the product. I would recommend it to the next person, with caution. Proceed carefully and good luck!</li>
    <li> Awesome, awesome, awesome! Stinky. But did I mention awesome? Took years of box dye and permanent professional color out and put me right back to my natural color. No brassiness. No uneven tone. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> YOU WILL NEVER GET THE SMELL OUT. It&#x27;s been weeks and I still smell it and I&#x27;ve scrubbed the whole sink area. Besides that it&#x27;s great if you follow the instructions exactly. If you have thick hair I&#x27;d suggest buying two.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these and followed the directions, which was tedious. But, bottom line, the hair got a little lighter, but in no way was stripped of the dye color</li>
    <li> This is a legit product.  I&#x27;ve been blonde my whole 29 years and decided in a impulsive &amp;#34;last year of my 20&#x27;s&amp;#34; rage I would get it dyed professionally Red. I wanted &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Auburn&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Burnt Orange&amp;#34; I got DARK cherry magenta almost purplish mahogany. With pinkish streaks and orange tips. As soon as I got home from my appt. I searched &amp;#34;red hair back to blonde&amp;#34; in youtube and found this stuff. I RAN to walgreens and got 2 bottles (thank God I got 2 bottles, I think most people need 2 bottles unless you have a dude cut) followed the directions and slept with coconut oil soaked in my hair as a conditioner. Woke up and showered/dried to the most beautiful color I&#x27;ve ever had, A beautiful blend of shiny lovely bright blonde and a rich coppery strawberry base where the deepest red was. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted going into the salon - for $10. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> My hair is thin/fine, but very long - halfway down my rear end. It is naturally dark chocolate, with reddish glints in sunlight. However, my roots have gotten more ashy like a dark mousy brown since the birth of my son a couple years ago, and it looks like I am getting two streaks of white just above each temple. I have colored my hair with deep brown to black temporary box color (Natural Instincts 10 minute, Perfect 10, etc) and most recently with a violet tinted black from Zotos Age Beautiful (1V Plum Black), which used a 10 volume developer. The bottom half of my hair seemed much darker(makes sense), and I wondered if the white streaks were longer than just the couple inches of new growth, so I decided to try Color Oops, intending to recolor later, and maybe do something fun with the streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is so long, I used 2 boxes - 1 would not have been enough. I made 2 pony tails and put the first box on that part for 10 minutes, then applied box 2 to the rest, put on the shower cap and stood outside in the Texas sun for the rest of the 20 minutes. I expected a nasty smell, but frankly, it barely had a scent at all as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Kind of like a perm solution smell, but very faint. I used shampoo 5 times and rinsed, taking 30-35 minutes total rinse time, using hot water. I then applied conditioner (Zotos Age Beautiful Intense Strengthening all over and Loreal Healthy Look conditioner - left over after a recent hair coloring - just on the ends), put on a fresh shower cap, waited 5 minutes, then rinsed, cooling the water to cold at end and rinsing a good 5 minutes total with the cold water. My hair felt stiff at first, but I Applied Zotos Hairtrition color protect/detangler liberally before drying, and that seemed to help seal it. I dried with the hair dryer, then used the cool setting on the hair dryer to thoroughly cool hair after it was dry. Cooling your hair helps seal the cuticle back up. It feels no more damaged than before, so I&#x27;m pretty pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did not have any breakage at all. Color clearly came out, and it went from black with a hint of brown to warm chestnut brown with a strong hint of red (but not brassy - its a nice natural looking shade). It is lighter at roots than ends, but I expected that, and it blends nicely. I was going to recolor the next day, but I am going to leave it for a while and see what the new growth looks like, as well as see how it looks in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a professional hair stylist and I am very pleased with the results of this color remover. I don&#x27;t enjoy stripping color out of hair--it&#x27;s so damaging. But this Color Oops left minimal damage, and I was very impressed. I only needed one box for shoulder-length hair. I followed the instructions on the box. I was removing demi-permanent color, and this really did the trick. My client&#x27;s hair had a nice warm brown tone to it, close to her natural color, and we didn&#x27;t tone afterwards because it looked quite pretty. We didn&#x27;t do any other processing afterwards, just a protein filler to counteract any porosity damage (which you will get when doing any type of chemical treatment) and we then highlighted with a toned bleach (Kaleidocolor) 2-3 weeks afterwards, which turned out great. All in all, I am satisfied with the results of this Color Oops and I will use it again in a heartbeat if I need to.</li>
    <li> I accidentally dyed my hair the wrong color. I&#x27;d picked up the wrong color at the store, and put it aside, intending to return it. About a year later I needed to do my hair, and hey! I already had a box of color! Lucky me, right? :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dyed my medium brown hair using a dark brown dye. My hair always grabs color, so this came out seriously dark brown. Almost black, Goth dark brown. I didn&#x27;t have any tones and highlights, it looked like a wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color Oops worked like a charm. I put it on quickly, and after 20 minutes headed to the shower. Bring a radio and a timer. This takes FOREVER. I washed my hair, lathering for 5 minutes. Rinsed for 10 minutes. Rewashed my hair, lathering for 5 minute. Rinsed for 10 minutes. Rewashed my hair, lathering for 5 minutes. Rinsed again. Got out of the shower, towel-dried my hair, and added a thick protein-based conditioner. Left the conditioner on for 20 minutes. Got back in the shower and rinsed out the conditioner for 5 minutes. Then I used the conditioner that came with my box of hair dye, and left that on for 5 minutes. Rinsed for several minutes once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the dark brown dye was removed from my hair leaving my hair a standard medium brown. My hair does feel terrible, and I had the worst rats-nests and tangles I&#x27;ve had since I was a little girl. I used a leave-in conditioner to help me slide the tangles out, and my hair looks and feels pretty good. In fact, I probably won&#x27;t re-dye it again right away. It looks just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This stuff stinks. Make sure you have a good bathroom fan.&lt;br /&gt;This takes forever to work. Bring some entertainment. I listened to podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a bit runny. Be careful, it burns/itches a bit when it&#x27;s on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not this works for you is based a bit on how well you wash and rinse your hair. It shrinks the color molecules, you have to physically wash them out.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff will make your hair feel like straw. Be prepared with a thick protein conditioner, or two, or three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS! This stuff just saved me a $150 trip to the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address some comments: I used this product exactly for what it was intended, lightening too-dark permanent hair color. It says in the box that it doesn&#x27;t work on direct dyes like Manic Panic and it&#x27;s not for semi-permanent color, and it won&#x27;t put your hair back the way it was before you bleached it. I believe it works like a charm if you use it for what it was intended. Based on a lot of comments, if you try to make it do something it wasn&#x27;t formulated for, you&#x27;ll have bad results.ared with a thick protein conditioner, or two, or three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS!

    <li> Okay so yesterday I had my naturally dark brown hair (between 3 and 4) dyed a shade darker, and it was way too dark and severe looking on me! I immediately began looking for solutions and found Color Oops and read all the rave reviews and saw all the youtube videos, so today I went and did my hair and it worked great for me. My hair is about shoulder length and very thick but one box was more than enough, I had quite a bit left over. Yes it smells pretty bad - exactly like rotten eggs - but it was easily bearable so who cares? Oh and have some scissors or something to cut the tip of the squirt top off! It is very runny and hard to apply as it drips, so I squirted some in my hand and rubbed it in. That worked well just make sure to apply evenly. I could tell when it was in the shower cap that it was working. My hair is pretty dark and looks almost black when wet, but it has a soft brown tone to it, and I could see that slight brown tone was returning before even starting to shampoo and rinse. And oh the rinsing! I did it for 25 minutes to be safe - I set a timer on my phone and placed it on the window by the shower where I could see it. I also had my laptop and played music the whole time, which I definitely recommend. It was almost relaxing ... well it would be if it was not so tedious! The hot water never ran out even 25 minutes later, perhaps we just have a good water heater haha When I had it in the shower cap I could see the roots in the middle of my head were almost a caramely type color, and the rest looked like my normal hair when wet. I think I applied it a bit too much to the top part of my head and was a little worried it would be uneven. When I got out my hair looked normal, and the whole top was slightly lighter/caramely than my natural hair, and I mean the whole top not just the roots so it looked good. But now a couple hours later it is not really any lighter than normal, which I am frankly disappointed about because I really liked it, perhaps I will use the rest of it or get another box and try it again to see if it will stick. My hair now has a pronounced coppery/red tint that looks nice (my hair naturally has a very very very slight coppery tint to it). Overall this product worked very well and was cheap ($9 something at Wal-Mart)and so I am very happy. I am the ideal candidate for this product though, having my virgin hair gone darker less than 24 hours ago, so it might not work as well for others. I am not planning to dye my hair again, but will probably use the rest of the Color Oops tonight or tomorrow but for now I need a break from my hair ... plus I want to see what it looks like completely dry - I hate blow drying - and give it a chance to settle as I hear that it can darken over the next day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it did not damage my hair at all. While rinsing it felt dry but only from the prell shampoo I used and as soon as I put conditioner in it was smooth as silk. I got a deep conditioner but did not use it because my hair felt fine. I will probably use it next time though cause I have it. Feel free to ask me if you have any questions! I put a pic in the images so you can see what my hair looked like throughout this journey.</li>
    <li> 5;04 PM - YAY! So excited to be finally using this. (Note; Delivery was going to take ages so i popped into my local walgreens and found it. Awesome! So coming straight home i read through the instructions. Right now, i am applying it to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5;33 - Its on! I have longish hair but there was enough for my whole hair. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t leave splotches of the color i WANT to remove in my hair. The smell is bearable but disgustingly similar to rotting eggs. But i&#x27;m grinning and bearing with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5;40 - About to go into the shower. I am using Paul Mitchell Teatree shampoo and conditioner. I have come to a revelation that my hair is disgustingly chemically abused. So i&#x27;m trying the healthy less chemically way. Hopefully this is as great as all the reviewers on Amazon claim it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6;47 - IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK!!! So disappointed &#x3D;( My hair is still the same color, though a bit lighter.... But than again i just spent the whole day under the sun so that might account for why. But still i am so disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t work. Might have to just go ahead and get the bleach color remover or just dye it as close to my natural color as i can find on a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISAPPOINTED!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.... Will update if anything happens to change. &#x3D;&#x27;(</li>
    <li> My hair is practically all grey but over a period of time of applying light brown/dark blonde colors, it became a very dark brown because it got more porous.  Oops Hair color remover was seriously not worth my time, expense and effort because I see little difference after following the instructions to a T.  (Apply, wait 20 min, shampoo, rinse for 15 to 20 min!, shampoo again and rinse 5 more minutes.  If you only have one layer of color, you might have better luck but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> This product has a really strong smell, but it does a really good job at taking out hair coloring</li>
    <li> Yikes! First application it turned my hair orange. Second time it turned it strawberry blonde with a hint of orange. NOT even close to my natural color. Ggrrr! I thought it would strip it to my natural color. Wrong! I started out with 2 inch natural brown with gray and on the ends was brown and blond highlights. Then I dyed it all brown to even it out. Didn&#x27;t like that brown color so I tried color oops to get to the brown/gray grow out.  WRONG!  Never again.</li>
    <li> My original hair is dark brown (bordering black) and I died it to an auburn-ish color. Got Color Oops: Extra Strength to turn it back since my friend recommended it to me. Firstly, it smells disgusting, like rotten boiled eggs. Secondly, it makes your whole room smell like ass. I have very fine hair and it absorbs anything VERY easily, so I bought it and followed the instructions word for word. Not only did it NOT turn my hair back to its original color, but it made me lose a lot of hair and my head smelled like the crappy formula (even after 2 washes.)     DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!    I should have just re-dyed my hair.</li>
    <li> First, thanks to everyone who wrote helpful hints - they made a big difference.    I&#x27;m 45 and have been dyeing my hair forever (having come from a long line of women who turn gray at 28...)  My roots are almost completely white.  I&#x27;ve been dyeing it fairly dark brown for several years and wanted to soften it a bit as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  Since color, won&#x27;t lighten color, I had to get rid of the previous color first.    I followed the directions carefully and after using Color Oops my hair was a lovely brownish-yellow color.  I didn&#x27;t panic since everything said that was to be expected.  20 minutes seemed like forever to rinse, but I wasn&#x27;t going to cut corners at that point.  My hair felt very dry after rinsing out the Color Oops, but I put some heavy duty condition on it and then some Frizz-ease on my damp hair and it actually felt very good after that.    I waited until the next morning to dye again and first used a bottle of protein hair filler on it (small bottle, ~$2 at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply).  I don&#x27;t know if that made a difference, but several people had recommended it and it definitely didn&#x27;t seem to hurt.    Then, the part that made me the most nervous since I was very unsure of what color to try.  I only went from a 6 to a 6 1/2 even though the directions said it would dye darker.  I left the dye on for about 5 minutes since I could tell it was taking the color very quickly and amazingly enough I got a color very close the color on the box.  I am very happy - I have a color a shade lighter that what I was using with no ill effects!</li>
    <li> your hair will become thin and you will need to use some intense mask to get them back, not worth it if your color is &amp;#34;un-natural&amp;#34; as I did, I tried to used it on my purple and it only got id down one tone, not worth it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until a day later to write my review on this product to give the full results, so here it is.    I&#x27;ve been dying my hair at home for years.  I am a brunette with red undertones in my hair.  I spent months trying to get rid of the red in my hair; I just didn&#x27;t care for it.  My last attempt was using the new foam (Clairol Nice and Easy)hair dye another reviewer said she had used too.  Do not use this hair dye!  It is a mess to deal with; it got everywhere!  Just as the other reviewer experienced it did not dye my hair the color it was intended (dark ash brown).  Instead, it came out black and spotty in some areas!  After a month of dealing with my terrible hair color and just feeling completely awful every time I looked at myself in the mirror I came across Color Oops!  I read all the reviews, rushed to CVS picked up a box and took the plunge last night as soon as I got home from work.    I must say that 20 is quite a long time to stand/sit in a shower and rinse your hair.  The last few minutes I was really getting impatient... Its not like you can read a book in the shower!  LOL.  However, whatever it took I was willing.  I then washed my hair and rinsed for 5 minutes and repeated the process a second time.  If I had more patience I would have rinsed my hair for another 20 minutes.  I have two hot water heaters in my house and I had used up all the hot water by the time I was finished!    I then conditioned my hair for 5 minutes, rinsed again and let it air dry.  The dark hue isn&#x27;t completely gone, but it (as my husband says) is 100% better than it was.  Instead of a dull black on the tips of my hair I can see the natural red undertones in my hair again.  which, I&#x27;ve never been happier to see!  It now looks like I have deep brown low lights in my hair with copper highlights.  My husband even said my hair is closer to the color it was when we first started dating... much of a relief to me.    The product also left my hair looking shiny.  Probably mostly due to the conditioner, but I don&#x27;t feel my hair is damaged in anyway.      I also wanted to comment about the smell that so many reviewers mentioned.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how some people color their hair if they thought this product smelled awful.  There is a smell (a very diluted mild sulfur smell), but perms smell more overwhelming.    Hope this helped!</li>
    <li> I used two boxes of this product and I refused to buy anymore. It made the hair on the top of my head orangeish-brown and did barely anything to the rest of my hair. I should have known a second box wouldn&#x27;t cure it. The smell is terrible! It lingered in my bathroom for days no matter what I tried. My natural hair is brown with some natural highlights. I dyed it a very dark brown. If I ever choose to color my hair again, it definitely won&#x27;t be a darker color! On a side note, I bought Vanish Color Remover which worked much better. It did not turn my hair orange.</li>
    <li> I had dyed my hair bright red (very close to the little mermaid red, if not it)&amp; rocked the look for about two or three months.  Then I grew tired of the up keep. After doing some research I got color oops, well I washed my hair multiple times before using the product; used the color oops and my hair came out light blondish/orange with a hit of red. I rated this four stars because it works it actually took most of the bright red off. Definitely would recommend Color Oops.</li>
    <li> My natural color is a 6A, with no grays.  The hair itself is fine but thick and about 2\\&quot; below my shoulders.  For 2.5 years, I have been coloring it at home to a 4A or 4AR.  I wanted to go a bit lighter this summer and also get rid of the over-dyed look of my ends.  I started by getting a hair cut--a nice layered medium-length bob that got rid of the most over-dyed parts of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That same day, I used the \\&quot;maximum strength,\\&quot; Color Oops, let it develop for 20 minutes, then rinsed it for 30 minutes (washing it 4 times during that time).  I conditioned afterwards for about 15 minutes. My hair came out a light auburn color that was actually kind of pretty; the hair itself felt fine--no damage.  The color did darken up a bit over the next 24 hours, so I did another application of Color Oops, this time using the \\&quot;extra conditioning\\&quot; version instead of the \\&quot;maximum strength.\\&quot;  It lightened my hair a bit more but probably not enough to justify the cost of the additional application.  After another deep conditioning, my hair felt great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have a more even base to color over and should be able to use the 6R hair color that I bought and get good results.  It&#x27;s actually fairly close to the shade that the Color Oops left behind, so much so that I would skip coloring completely for a few weeks except that I also have about 2\\&quot; of dark ash blond roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does smell a bit; it reminds me of the smell from getting a permanent wave.  Put the bathroom fan on, open the window, use an air freshener . . . it&#x27;s really not a big deal and does not cling to your hair for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post-Color Update:  This morning, I used Vidal Sassoon 6R but did not pull it through to the ends of my hair. I let it process for only 15 minutes instead of the 20-30 noted in the directions.  Final result is a head of beautiful medium auburn hair that is healthy and shiny.  Super pleased with the Color Oops and my gorgeous hair!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring and treating my own hair for about a year now. Before that, I worked in the salon industry and was very conscientious about my hair. After getting out of the industry, I wanted to save money on the treatments as well as give my hair some time off from all the processing. Last November, I dyed my hair dark chocolate brown, my yearly winter change from my natural fairly light blonde. After even re-dying it the same dark shade in January and highlighting it with warm blonde in March, I used Color Oops recently and it really got me back to a blonde shade. Yes, it is a little orange, and it&#x27;s not my natural color. But for the time I spent using the product, it was completely worth it. I followed the directions well, although I didn&#x27;t patch or strand test. But I applied it from the back to the front, ensuring my highlighted pieces were the last to get the product. I kept it on the full 20 minutes. I then rinsed for 15, washed, rinsed for another 10, washed again and rinsed for another 5, conditioned and rinsed for 10, then washed, rinsed, and conditioned again. I know it seems excessive on washing and conditioning, but rinsing gets boring and the hair feels like straw. The conditioning I did (using moisturizing masks and leaving on for 3-5 minutes) really helped my hair go through this process- it came out even softer and healthier than before, I also did a coconut oil treatment the same morning before using Color Oops. The color came out light, and continued to lighten over the evening! The next step for me is to tone it using blue food coloring and vinegar. Just be smart and take care of your hair, and this product is great!</li>
    <li> Okay, it stunk. It really was pretty bad, but I could handle that if the awful, excess color would just go away. Almost twenty four hours later, it&#x27;s better, but I keep catching a whiff now and then. I&#x27;m hoping, HARD, that it&#x27;s much better by tomorrow. Now, reviewing how it performed in removing the color, it worked perfectly well. I&#x27;d have given it five stars, but the smell is almost nauseating. If you have a few days to lay low, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product worked, yet I&#x27;m only not rating it 5 stars because I still have a lot of color left in my hair from dyeing, when I&#x27;ve only used semipermanent dyes.</li>
    <li> This stuff removed blue black dye in less than 20 minutes. It came out even and fairly undamaged. Every time I use it, my hair comes out to a pretty light red-brown color. I love it.</li>
    <li> Removes dark colors like magic</li>
    <li> It did take out a lot of my red color I had in my hair. It makes your hair weird and stiff for a month after. My hair still smelt like rotten eggs for weeks.  I think it would have worked better if my red color was fresh but it was already fading out. It didn&#x27;t really take the color out under my hair in the back .</li>
    <li> Buy this. Seriously. It worked magic for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s some background: I&#x27;ve had light blonde for a long time. My natural hair color is dark mousy blonde. I originally had my hair bleached at a salon about 4 years ago and have been using ash blonde box dye since. A few days ago I had the day off and I was bored so on an impulse (as bad decisions often are) I decided to dye my hair a light auburn red color. It came out awful. Seriously terrible. Very fiery orange and completely wrong for my skin tone. I was going to make a salon appointment to fix asap, but instead, decided to give Color Oops a whirl. As I have bleached my hair at home before and ended up with yellow/brassy hair, I also purchased a box of light ash blonde to tone afterwards, since I assumed that Color Oops would turn my hair yellow or orange. BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T. I didn&#x27;t need the box dye. Color Oops lifted the red out completely and brought my hair to a really nice blonde (evenly, too!) I did, however, shampoo and rinse like crazy. Overall, I spent 30 minutes in the shower rinsing/shampooing/rinsing etc. I think this is a really vital step to how successful your results are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the smell: it&#x27;s not as bad as I thought it would be. A little like rotten eggs, but nothing intolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the damage: unfortunately, my hair didn&#x27;t come out damage-free. It doesn&#x27;t look quite as raggedy as it might have if I&#x27;d bleached it, but it does feel dry right now. However, this might have been due to the red dye, and maybe the cheap shampoo I used on it (I read that cheap shampoo has more detergents, so it helps strip the color). It&#x27;s probably nothing some deep conditioning wont solve, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stress enough how much of a miracle this product is. I was so skeptical going in, but my results were fantastic.</li>
    <li> I just used this product yesterday and it worked great! I&#x27;ve been dying my hair black for the last several months and finally decided it was time for a change so I purchased this product. Although the smell was really strong and made me feel a little sick, the product works really well and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger after you wash it out. The product removed all the black dye from my hair and brought it back to its natural medium brown shade. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair dark red and (most recently) brown for about 15 years. If it wasn&#x27;t for my roots, I wouldn&#x27;t even know what color my hair is naturally. I have damaged my hair with bleach, fried it with a flat iron, and had many color mistakes. I am finally ready to embrace my natural color but wasn&#x27;t sure how to get the dark brownish red (really dark at tips) out of my hair. Decided to give this a try (even thoufh some reviews scared me a bit) and it worked amazingly!! I left it on the full 20 minutes and set another timer for the the rinse. After experience with trying to strip color, I decided to use dawn dish soap. It works great to remove all color without damaging your hair like prell can sometimes do. I also basically scrubbed my hair the entire time and used as hot asbi could stand it (thought I would pass out if my timer didn&#x27;t go off soon). My hair is at least 3 shades lighter and back to (what I&#x27;m pretty sure is) my natural color!</li>
    <li> So I was bold and wanted to try a natural reddish color, but that didn&#x27;t work out very well, it turned out to dark maroon. I bought this and tried it. Then my hair turned bright orange-red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very familiar with hair coloring as this was my first time to do it, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with blonde-brown tones instead of red.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that taking red coloring out of hair is difficult.</li>
    <li> I coloured my hair a burgundy colour, which I regretted soon after. So I went on the net and found videos of people using this item and getting good results. This item is not available in Australia so I chose to buy it through Amazon and I got it 2 weeks exactly after purchasing it. Very happy with this product as after using it, all the burgundy was gone. &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally a golden strawberry blonde but in the past 6 months I&#x27;ve dyed my hair dark brown three times. In my stupidity I bought an ombré hair box dye and didn&#x27;t realize that it was for only dark to lighter blonde hair, I had already applied it to the ends of my hair when I realized this so I thought I would just apply it all over to get one color. This made my roots turn a nice bleach blonde and left the rest of my hair an orangey-brassy red. It was not cute. I was skeptical as to whether color oops would work for me since I had been dying my hair dark for so many months and also had just bleached it, but I tried it any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews about how awful the smell was and so I braced myself by lighting some incense in the bathroom with me, but honestly I prefer the smell of this product to the smell of hair bleach any day! I followed the directions, leaving it on for 20 minutes and then washing my hair for 20 minutes. It really did take away a lot of the dark color and my hair is more one toned now instead of two very contrasting tones. Its not back to my natural color but it is close! It&#x27;s still red but not brassy, it&#x27;s more of a dark strawberry blonde now. After I towel dried it, I put in an argan oil hydrating hair mask, and it seriously took what was left of the smell of the product away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very surprised and happy about this product. I will definitely be recommending it in the future, but hopefully not having to use it anymore!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my own hair at home for about 12 years. I mean marathon coloring. I&#x27;ve had every color under the sun except for platinum. Over the last 2-3 years I like to think my taste in color has somewhat matured. I generally stick to rich dark browns and red browns (barring the brief fire engine red phase). I got home yesterday from a beach vacation and decided to refresh my color after my several days in the sun, saltwater, and chlorine. As usual, I opted for a rich reddish brown. Unfortunately, I used a new brand of color and to my horror, my hair was almost black even after blow drying. Being a seasoned veteran of the hair catastrophe clan, I rushed out to get some Color Oops. My hair isn&#x27;t particularly long but it&#x27;s ridiculously thick so I bought two boxes at Walmart for about $9-$10 each. I came home and followed the instructions to a T. (OK, so maybe I didn&#x27;t quite hit the exact goals on the rinsing time. But I still rinsed like crazy!) I was left with this super awesome (read awful) brassy orange color. I was not shocked, I knew what to expect. But at least now I had a lighter color to work with. As soon as it was dry, I followed it with my regular brand of dark reddish brown. And this is the tricky part. I know from previous experience how quickly your hair will darken when recoloring after Color Oops. I&#x27;ve never applied color to my hair faster than I did today. And literally as soon as I stepped away from the mirror where I applied the color, I stepped to the faucet to rinse it out. Due to my haste, I do think I missed a few spots here and there but overall I was left with a color similar to my original goal color. I do feel like the final color is not quite as vibrant as I&#x27;d like. Call it &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; if you will. However, if you actually read the instructions, this is to be expected. Bottom line, I&#x27;m left with a color very similar to what I wanted originally and in time I&#x27;ll be able to color it again to get exactly what I want. Much better than the black that I ended up with after the first round of color! Therefore, the Color Oops did exactly what it was supposed to do and for that I&#x27;m grateful. Again, for me, the biggest concern is making sure that you don&#x27;t leave the 2nd round of color on too long or you&#x27;ll end up right back where you started. Thank you Color Oops for another saved hair botch. Until next time....</li>
    <li> (Just for some background, as every person&#x27;s hair color and dying experience will be different)  I have the following colors on my shoulder-length Caucasian hair:  Henna (ends to midway, not boxed stuff either, 100% natural BAQ henna), chemical BOX dyes going back from Nov-Dec 2014 (red, then black), removed using Color B4 and now mid 2015 med browns at hairdresser to mask the inevitable resulting orange).  I have used both Color B4 (English equiv to Color Oops - or so I thought!) and Color Oops several times over the past 4 or 5 years with no trouble or affect on the natural color.  Perhaps 4-5 times each brand!  The stuff has been a miracle for me in the past. (Bye bye to my Morticia hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto this week.  Imagine my confusion when in one dose of Color Oops I not only end up with the brassiness that I was expecting (happens every time, hair colorants &#x3D; bleach, except for with henna)... but with almost 8 MONTHS of root growth suddenly lightened as surely as if I&#x27;d used a bleach product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, breathe, chill, I&#x27;m trying to go back to natural color anyway, spilt milk and all, so I go to Sally&#x27;s to pick up some demi permanents to try getting back to my natural 6 warm color so I can leave the world (wait, no, prison) of hair coloring, roots and damage behind me.  I ask the lady who owns the store for Color Oops I realized there&#x27;s still some darker deposits waiting to oxidize in my hair.  She tells me &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t use that - it contains bleach or something. Another customer came in last week with the same problem you have and we decided something&#x27;s going on there&amp;#34;.  She recommended Color Fix instead which I used and it worked well.  I can&#x27;t attest to whether it would have done the same lightening effect on my hard-earned roots as Color Oops.  I&#x27;m probably scared off of these products for life, perhaps not Color B4 -- that&#x27;s never failed for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you decide to use this to get rid of OLD color, perhaps have someone capable ofapplying the product with a tint brush and mixing bowl to only hit the dyed ends.  Don&#x27;t just slather it all over like some kinda hair mask.  Also, Color FIX came with a lotion to rinse after the washing process, so you can test if any residual colors are lurking within that will interfere with a corrective or additional color you plan on doing later on.  I feel like I can get 2 uses from the Color Fix product, but you&#x27;ll only get 1 use out of Color Oops unless you have short or super thin hair.  Color Fix also doesn&#x27;t ask for like 30 minutes of rinsing, just 3-5 (I did about 15 though, then shampoo&#x27;d THEN used the lotion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips, if you&#x27;re looking into the product for the first time, or any of the removers for that matter.  Not a pro but I&#x27;ve been doing this with myself as a guinea pig for a while.&lt;br /&gt;- LEAVE OFF YOUR JEWELRY.  This stuff turned one of my rings the same orange it turned my hair.  It&#x27;s just doing what it does.&lt;br /&gt;- Whether you went black, red or bleach blonde, your natural color has almost certainly be altered by the developer, esp with gross box dyes.&lt;br /&gt;- i.e.  You will likely have a brassy result even if your hair was once ash.  It&#x27;s worse if you&#x27;re a dark/warm/golden/red haired person though, i.e. if your hair naturally glows reddish or looks a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; color in the sun.  I think dying exposes that pigment and Color Oops shows that up.&lt;br /&gt;- I have never encountered any damage from this process.  Some people do though.  But most importantly DO NOT add conditioners or anything else straight after using except for a clarifying shampoo for the initial rinsing process.  I wait about 3-4 days before using any oil or conditioning products on my hair to avoid &amp;#34;trapping&amp;#34; any unwanted residual dye molecules in the hair cuticles.  So: Wash, wash, wash, THEN shampoo, then like 3 days of just combing and scraping your hair back into whatever style it agrees with.&lt;br /&gt;- I do not think it works well on stain dyes such as Manic Panic, Directions or even demi dyes, but I have successfully gotten one color out so it is worth a try if you&#x27;re desperate.  You might want to try a salon in this case.&lt;br /&gt;- Do the process in a warm room to speed it up or get the most from it.  You must RINSE well.  Otherwise the old shrunken dye molecules will bounce right back with oxidization.  Happens to me all the time with this specific color remover, which is partly why I dislike it so much compared to the others I&#x27;ve used, RE-OXIDIZATION.&lt;br /&gt;- Avoid using this process twice in a row.  If you can, wait a few days in-between if you really must, for condition AND for your poor hair&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret ever dying my hair or using sulfate shampoos.  If you&#x27;ve never dyed your hair and are looking into it -- at least do your research into demi dyes or think long and hard.  Maintenance, roots and damage are certainly not worth it, at least for me.  I would love to get back my pre-raphaelite hair!  Natural hair is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips even if they help just one person out there&lt;br /&gt;- Good professionals. (Correction, demi jobs)&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re after change, maybe try changing hair STYLE, not color.&lt;br /&gt;- Avoid permanent box dyes, or box dyes in general.  You cannot control the strength of the developer in these.  Look into getting a developer and the color to do yourself, as you can control the results much better!  (Only took me 5 years + like 30 dyes to figure this one out!)&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re impatient, slow-grower or dislike the same color, avoid henna or any super dark colors -- good luck getting rid of true BAQ henna.&lt;br /&gt;- After using every brand and product like this under the sun, I&#x27;m becoming sensitive to the nasty hair chemicals, Color Oops included.  This product left me with a rash on my left ear where I have a piercing, and no it wasn&#x27;t the earrings.  My arms also itched that day and the day after, which is a new thing.</li>
    <li> I just want to really really let everyone know that color oops actually works!!! I had my hair bleached blonde for over summer, and my stylist was supposed to just darken my hair closer to my natural hair color--medium soft brown. She turned my hair jet black and when I asked her to fix it, she put little high lights in my jet black hair. Two days have passed and today I used two boxes of color oops in my hair. I followed the directions and used for only 20 mins. The next thing it says is to rinse and repeat. Ladies and gentlemen, please actually do that! It makes all the difference. My hair looks so beautiful, the jet black hair is gone! What is here is some of my highlights and my medium brown hair with the slightest hint of red. I think what is important is not to wait longer than 72 hours to put the product on and to actually take the time to follow the directions.</li>
    <li> I colored my hair Reba red, and then tried to tone it down with a darker color, then tried to lighten it with another color, and I had a pretty red top, dark brown middle &amp; black ends.  I absolutely hated it, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune for a &#x27;color correction&#x27; with bleach at a beauty salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Color oops and after the first bottle, I already loved the color. I tried to get it a little lighter with a 2nd bottle, and it may have lightened it just a smidge, but I still LOVED the color I was left with.  It is all one even color, and it is actually the color I have been trying to get from a bottle for years! A very natural light brown. I am extremely happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long to my mid-shoulder-blades.  And 1 bottle was perfect coverage.  I did it just as it said, left it on 20 minutes, and washed and rinsed like crazy both times.  But for some reason the 2nd bottle didn&#x27;t really lighten it as much as the first did.  I am probably 75% gray, but it didn&#x27;t take the color all the way to the grey, and I don&#x27;t think it ever would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I had a lot of grey roots already growing out, I used a &amp;#34;protein filler&amp;#34; (aka, protein conditioner, color filler), which you must use if you plan on coloring it right after you use color oops.  If you don&#x27;t use it, the next color will grab to dark, and uneven.  It doesn&#x27;t come with the oops, so you&#x27;ll need to purchase it separately.  I got mine at &#x27;Sally&#x27;s salon supplies&#x27;.  Put it on damp hair, let sit 20 minutes, and blot with towel...don&#x27;t rinse, and color as normal.  (this is all listed in the &#x27;tips&#x27; section of the oops directions for recoloring.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent for restoring a dark color to a lighter brown/dark blond.  Which is what it did for me.  It is smelly, but no worse than a &#x27;perm&#x27; smell, and you have to wash &amp; rinse your hair so much, that it smells normal by the time you&#x27;re done.  It didn&#x27;t damage my hair, and I don&#x27;t have any red highlights left in it.  It&#x27;s a natural even light brown.  LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*(all the constant washing &amp; rinsing did eventually make my scalp sore, and when I put the color on my roots, my scalp did burn a little, but not terrible.  I only put the color on my grey roots.  I didn&#x27;t pull it through to the ends because I didn&#x27;t want to damage my ends with excessive treatments, and I really like the color that was left behind with the oops anyway.  The root color matched perfectly.)</li>
    <li> After the remover treatment we need a kératine product</li>
    <li> By far the best product I&#x27;ve used! I&#x27;m naturally a blonde but been dying my hair black for years, I used this once and it got me to almost my natural hair color. I would recommend this to anyone who needs it. It&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have medium thick black dyed hair and wanted to change since the white roots are way too of a contrast with the black.Several years ago I bleached my hair at the salon to turn it red and it completely destroyed my hair to the point that I had to cut it short and go back to black LOL. So...now I wanted something gentle, no more bleach and I &#x27;ve found Color Oops;after reading several reviews I said I give it a try.Now...it comes very fast, in a nice box, it has both gloves and cap; to me it doesn&#x27;t stinks at all,it&#x27;s actually more of a citrus scent,I waited 20 minutes then washed it for another 15.The results were ok for me-it erased half of the hair color and did a pretty good job at the other end, where the dye has several layers not only 1 or 2.It didn&#x27;t dried my hair, it didn&#x27;t burned my skin.I might buy another box to remove the extra black from my hair...I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This was not the &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; for my hair color. I dyed my hair blue with ION, (don&#x27;t ever use that) and I was desperate to get rid of it. I was just tired of the color, and it took forever to fade. I&#x27;m pretty sure this blue color has metallics in it, so I&#x27;m thinking this is the reason it didn&#x27;t work. Also It stained my hair, and this might not fix stained hair. I&#x27;m sure this works for some, but if it doesn&#x27;t, I suggest you just wait at least five months without any dye. Try and let your hair fade a little and maybe just put toner over it, if you can&#x27;t stand it. Make sure your hair&#x27;s elasticity is good (not breaking off.) Then If you&#x27;re going lighter try and bleach it, which is super damaging but sometimes you have no other choice. I had to bleach mine, and it went through green, then light orange, to finally blond. I made sure to get at least 2 inches cut off, which also might be a good idea after this product. This product dried out my hair so much afterwards, so make sure you do a deep conditioner after. Hope I helped someone out there that is ready to give up on their hair! If you never try out what I said, or this product, you&#x27;ll never know if It helps or not!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally light strawberry blonde hair. I hated it from the time I was young due to the fact I was the only one with that hair color. I&#x27;ve been bleaching and dying it since the age of 13 (I&#x27;m now 22). Most recently it was bleached platinum blonde. I got sick of the ultra light color, and tried many times to put a darker blonde over it. Each time it would only last about 3 weeks, and the darker color would completely fade. Last night I decided to go darker, to a brown color, hoping it would stick and fade into a nice dark blonde color. It came out dark dark brown, almost black, and it did not look good with my skin tone AT ALL. After a google search, I saw something about Color Oops and went out to Walgreens to buy some (I couldn&#x27;t wait for shipping).     I followed the directions EXACTLY. I left it on for 20 minutes, got in the shower, rinsed and shampooed, rinsed for 15 minutes, shampooed, rinsed for 5 additional minutes, shampooed two more times. At this point I could feel that my hair was very dry, so I put in a deep conditioner and got out of the shower. I put a cap over my head and left the conditioner in (olive oil based) for 45 minutes. I rinsed, towel dried, and then blow dried my hair. I was very surprised at what I saw. Keep in mind the directions said it could not remove bleach or a light color, only darker colors. Also I had about 1/2 inch roots of my natural strawberry blonde. Well, my hair is now my natural color-it matches my roots PERFECTLY. There is no brown whatsoever. It is a light strawberry blonde with blonde and red highlights, as it was when I was younger. I have no idea how this happened, but it was quite amazing. I haven&#x27;t seen my hair this way for over 8 years. And ironically I love my hair color now, and I&#x27;m very grateful for this product for allowing me to see it again. My hair feels great and I won&#x27;t be damaging it anymore with bleaches and dye.     I can&#x27;t think of anything bad to say about this product, other then the smell. However, it wasn&#x27;t even that bad (All dyes and products smell bad in my opinion). I used the product 3 hours ago, and with all the shampooing and the deep conditioning my hair does not smell like the product anymore. I would highly recommend Color Oops!</li>
    <li> I have used this product two times.  The first time I used a brown hair dye that was only one shade darker than my natural hair and it turned my hair almost black.  I used Color Oops the next day and it brought back my original hair color.  The second time I used it, I had my hair dyed in a salon and it came out way too dark, almost black again!  (Perhaps I should just stop dying my hair.)  I contemplated my options and really didn&#x27;t want to have to pay at the salon to get it fixed so I thought I would give Color Oops another shot.  I used it 4 days after the dye job.  It did not take out all of the dye, but it is lighter and now at least looks like it is brown (a dark brown, but not black).  I can live with this color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell, but not as bad as you might think.  Use the fan in your bathroom and open the window a little bit and it won&#x27;t be any worse than dying your hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toughest part is the rinsing.  You must rinse it for at least 20 minutes or the dye molecules may not all be washed out and can reappear in your hair.  It takes a long time, but is worth it.  I then used a good conditioner, Aussie 3 minute miracle conditioner.  My hair is dry, but with constant conditioning it should be okay.</li>
    <li> I used to dye my hair a lot when I was younger. It was a sort of stress release for me.   As I got older, I decided I wanted to grow my hair out to be natural and beautiful. So I shaved my head and was letting it grow out.   about 11 months after shaving my head, I had a really bad day (aka failing a very important college chemistry exam) and went out and bought a box of \\&quot;semi permanent\\&quot; black dye.  The shock value was great and I loved the black for about a week. After about 3 weeks I realized that it wasn&#x27;t fading even slightly. I went online and read reviews about the hair dye and read horror stories about it never fading out.  So by this time I&#x27;m freaking out. All I wanted was my natural hair color back.     In comes Color OOps. This product has taken my hair back to the way it was. It looks like I never touched it. It&#x27;s also not damaging at all. Now, rinsing my hair in very hot water for 20 minutes definitely made it dry, but in a day or two it will be back to normal.  People complain of the smell, but I didn&#x27;t think it was very over whelming at all. The smell of hair dye is way more potent. This product smelled bad, but it was a faint smell.     I only had one layer of semi permanent dye over virgin hair so I guess that&#x27;s probably why my hair lifted so well, but it&#x27;s really easy and worth the effort.</li>
    <li> Be prepared to smell the sulphur in your hair every time you shower!  It last for about a month and it is worse whenyour hair is wet. Smell fades when your hair dries.</li>
    <li> I wrote original review, but I got mixed up with color fix! The color fix is great.  This product smelled awful like rotting eggs.  You have to rinse your hair for 20 plus minutes with as warm water as possible.  I washed and washed to try to get rid of the rotting egg smell out of my hair.  My bathroom smelled as well, while it was ventilated well.  My boyfriend had to leave the upstairs portion of the house.  I didn&#x27;t think it worked all that well either!  The color fix much much much better!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years, and anytime I&#x27;ve wanted to make a change, I&#x27;ve used Color Oops, and it&#x27;s worked! After years of dying my hair black, I used color oops and it lifted all of the black dye out, leaving the processed hair behind, which was now a lovely orangey color instead of my natural brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to be able to use this product and NOT dye your hair. If you&#x27;re stripping out color and leaving behing processed hair, it will have a weird tone. The chemicals don&#x27;t magically know what your original hair color is and return it.&lt;br /&gt;This product WILL NOT WORK on a non oxidative hair color like Manic Panic or other vegetable based demi-perm dyes.&lt;br /&gt;RINSE. This product works by shrinking the oxidative hair dye molecules so they can be rinsed out of your hair. If you don&#x27;t rinse well, they will reoxidize and your hair will get darker again. Also, if you don&#x27;t rinse, when you recolor your hair, those shrunken molecules will reoxidize and redeposit in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can recolor right away, but the color will come out several shades darker. If you wait overnight and treat with a deep conditioner the new color will be much more true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get your current permenant color out, or you want to go from dyed black to blond without frying your hair, this is a great product. I was able to get all the black dye out and bleach part of my hair to almost platnium in a single day without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> I WOULD NEVER USE COLOR OOPS EVER AGAIN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used color oops about two to three weeks back. My hair is in fairly good condition still, pretty soft as Ive been conditioning it like crazy since my single application of color oops for 20 mins with 10 minutes of application time for 30 minutes total. Waited the times in the shower for rinsing...followed the shampooing instructions... The smell wasn&#x27;t too bad but it does linger so it begins to get bad because you get sick of it. It pulled some of my brown color out to reveal some reddish undertones, and made my hair a tad lighter but nothing very noticeable. My hair&#x27;s dark blonde naturally but had brown, red, then brown on top.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to now. The other day I put my hair in a braid after washing it when I went to a friends house. I was like WOW why is my hair so thin?!?! Because I usually have my hair up for work. I thought maybe something was off or my anti-breakage stuff was doing its job. The next day after washing my hair I really looked at my hair because I was going to cut it and realized my hair was so thin!!! I normally have pretty thick hair and I have been seeing a lot of hair come out in the shower but I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day and have very long hair. After taking three years to grow out my previously bleached hair Ive sworn off bleach which is why I used this product because I thought it was a safer alternative to bleach and ammonia. Was I wrong!! I feel so sad I want to cry. I feel like less of a woman now. I miss my long thick head of hair and would give anything just to get it back :( Id recommend this product to my worst enemy. I hope color oops goes out of business and gets sued. Im not sure if my hair shafts are permanently damaged.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical before using this product, as I&#x27;ve used other color removers before. Previous products I&#x27;ve tried have left my hair very brittle, dry, and various shades of peach (none of which are desirable). My hair was most recently supposed to be a warm dark brown, but the end result was black. Black black. I tried to reason with the darkness for a while, but decided I couldn&#x27;t live with it any longer. I got Color Oops and a box of medium-light brown color to use after Color Oops. Here goes nothing, I thought.  Color Oops is runny, smells like a mix of rotten eggs and cow patties, and explodes when you open it after shaking the mixture (of the two ingredients). It does, however, really work. I used half a bottle on my head (I have long hair) and followed the instructions to rinse, rinse, shampoo, rinse, and shampoo and rinse again. Hesitant, I looked in the mirror... and it was pretty! Brown! Not black! Due to the success of attempt number one, I used the rest of the bottle on my head (dry) and let it sit for another 20 minutes. Then, back in the shower for another thirty minute wash-and-rinse fest. Out I came the second time with really lovely medium brown hair with lots of shine, thought the rest of the family was out of hot water for the night.   It worked well enough I didn&#x27;t need to use the box of color I purchased along with the Color Oops. I&#x27;m pleased with the nice warm brown it left my hair. My hair, even after two processes and all that shampooing, feels soft and healthy - I detect no damage from Color Oops. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, and the value is superb. I highly recommend!  Notes   - Really follow the directions with shampooing and rinsing, even though it will take you some time. Do it right.   - If your hair was bleached PRIOR to being colored, or if you color had a &#x27;lift&#x27; element to it (any type of bleach/peroxide), your hair WILL NOT go back to your natural color by using Color Oops - it will go back to the lifted/bleached/peroxided color.   - It, apparently, doesn&#x27;t work on bright rainbow colors - only shades of natural hair color.  - I did strand test a piece of my hair (post Color Oops) with the box of color I purchased, just to see... and the instructions in Color Oops don&#x27;t lie! It WILL color DARKER than what your color box shows. It really, really will. Be aware of that and purchase a much lighter color than you&#x27;d like the results to be, if you plan to color after Color Oops.  - Did I mention it smells? Open a window.</li>
    <li> I was dying my hair black for years, my natural hair color is a medium brown. I decided I wanted to go lighter so I bought Color Oops NOT expecting it to work, but to my surprise it did. It doesn&#x27;t return your hair to its natural color though. It left my hair looking a red/orange brassy color, but it does remove most of the old hair dye.</li>
    <li> Dyed my highlighted hair to medium ash brown which ended as a dark brown. Searched for a solution and decided to use  color oops depending on the reviews. I did what is said  but disappointed to the result. After all those long minutes at the shower and the worse smell, during and after, I now have a lighter tone of brown, not my highlights.</li>
    <li> So I rinsed for twenty minutes, my arms were literally sore. It was lightened but after washing again it is pretty close to the darkness it  was before but my roots are a little lighter. Although its not 100% even I have had much worse with other products. In the past after trying to lighten or get the black out the product made my roots a bright orange and did nothing at all to the rest. After a few more application starting on my ends I&#x27;m sure i will get there eventually, it took a while to put all this dye on and will no doubt take a little while to get it out. Surprisingly not that damaging, follow up with a couple of eggs and some olive oil in your hair for a half an hour.</li>
    <li> I bought this product out of desperation and wasn&#x27;t really expecting great results but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. The product removed nearly all of the color I had applied. My hair was still slightly darker than my natural colour, but only I could tell that. It definitely helped me avert a hair crisis. I do agree with the reviews that complain about the smell, which is the reason I give the product 4 stars instead of 5. The smell wasn&#x27;t that bad when I was using the product, but when I returned to the bathroom a few hours later it really did smell like a sewer. If you spill any, clean it immediately or it will stink for days!  If you&#x27;re in a bind this is worth a try!</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm to removed the Loreal hi color dark red out of my hair. I only used the bottle 1 n 2 that are in the kit and was told by a friend NOT to use the 3rd bottle in the kit. Well, worked fantastic and i have long hair and i only needed one kit and there was very minimal damage to my hair. I made sure to buy a really great conditioning treatment for after. ALSO, very important to rinse for 30 minutes. RINSE RINSE RINSE. Over the next 4-5 days, the more you wash n rinse your hair, your hair will go to a more natural look.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!!! I had my hair professionally colored two weeks ago. To say that I was extremely unhappy didn&#x27;t even begin to describe what I was feeling. I wanted my hair darker with faint red highlights. What I got was jet black hair with purple looking highlights. Picture this if you can. The top of my hair was a funky reddish purple and the bottom half was jet black. I read the reviews on here and I figured I would give it a try. I bought it at my local Walmart. I applied it to my hair and left it on for more than the allotted time, as I wanted to make sure the black and red were completely gone. I left it on for an extra ten minutes. I did follow directions closely when washing and rinsing. I washed and rinsed for the complete time stated. I used a clarifying shampoo. In the shower it did feel like a big clump of straw. After I finished washing and rinsing I immediately used conditioner. My hair came out great!!!! No more black or red. It is not my original color which is a dirty blond,it&#x27;s more of a strawberry blond. My hair did not turn out a funky color, and I am extremely satisfied with the end result!!!!!  ************ UPDATE***********  Jan. 29 2012 My hair has went back to the original color it was before I used the Color OOPS.</li>
    <li> I used this product once before on brown hair that had been dyed for years and hated the results I got, but then again attempted to use it a couple hours ago on freshly dyed brown hair and LOVED IT so heres the deal:&lt;br /&gt;(by the way this is for people going from brown to blonde, sorry..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried color oops I had already had brown hair for about a little more than a year and had used it for about 15 minutes . When I rinsed and dried my hair I did achieve the blonde look I was going for unfortunately it was orange and yellow and I REALLY wish I knew about toner but hey, so thats that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been blonde for years after that and LOVE IT I was always a natural blonde so my complexion is perfect for it and brown hair just washes me out and makes me look eternally sad, now I went to Supercuts today and asked for a glaze, they misunderstood me and gave me a demi permanent color WHATEVER NOT A BIG DEAL yeah thats what I thought, I originally picked a color that was IDENTICAL to that of my honey light blonde hair, even having the highlighted look I was going for but unfortunately once she washed my hair and dried it for me it was an ugly reddish brown color and I was in complete shock. I have never really had an emotional attachment to my hair since it is always changing but this was just gross. I panicked. Bought dandruff shampoo which made my hair a little lighter and literally shampooed my hair like 8 times finally i gave up and did the color oops knowing that it was the most damaging besides bleach. I brushed it through and waited for 10 minutes only to be surprised with a LOVELY honey blonde (although I did use purple shampoo to rinse I must admit, and I must also recommend for people with brassy orangey red tones in their hair or from hair dye, my hair picks up on that very harshly) My hair color now is even better than the blonde I had before and I am really wanting to call up the makers of this fabulous brand find them and give them a hug because this was truly a lifesaver. There is minimal damage, I recommend just putting oil on your hair a day before and conditioning a few times after as well as the next couple of weeks but nothing too drastic or ridiculous, about the same as dying your hair maybe less. ALL IN ALL if you have freshly dyed your hair and it sucks don&#x27;t think twice before getting this ASAP AFTER as long as you know your undertones, have the right toner on hand and don&#x27;t mind conditioning a little more I don&#x27;t really see the huge hassle! And also I would not recommend leaving it the full time(15-20 minutes0, 5-10 minutes (keep checking) and if you don&#x27;t get what you wanted condition for a week and try again! BEST OF LUCK I WAS READING REVIEWS ALL DAY SO I HOPE THIS HELPS!XOXO</li>
    <li> This product works really well. The smell isn&#x27;t great but I didn&#x27;t have as extreme of an aversion to it as some reviewers did. It removed my dark-dark brown hair color, my hair is now a warm light brown. If you&#x27;ve ever lightened your hair or if your dye had any bleaching agents (a lot do) it won&#x27;t go back to your natural color. However, it isn&#x27;t orange or anything and I can wear it down in public no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: you have to shampoo and rinse for at least 20 minutes or else it won&#x27;t work. I set an alarm on my phone and it&#x27;s a bit tiring, so make sure you leave yourself enough time. Also, get a good deep conditioner &#x27;cause this will dry out your hair a bit. I put the deep conditioner on with a shower cap (plastic bag will also work) for 40 minutes after I finished rinsing and my hair is soft now.</li>
    <li> Took both the dark purple I had on top, and the red underneath it! Works great!</li>
    <li> Great prodect never damage the hair !! My hair was dark red turn to brownish orange but not that bad !!</li>
    <li> Overall, Color Oops does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you skip/ don&#x27;t complete the rinse cycles then be prepared for your newly removed color to reappear!&lt;br /&gt;The rinsing is what gets the color out and if you don&#x27;t remove all the color... your hair will oxidize back to the color you were removing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried removing my black hair dye, but did not remove the color molecules enough during my rinse cycle. So, I ended up with a pretty dark auburn color, but when I tried to apply a new hair dye... my hair grabbed the new color and turned black in (what seemed like) seconds! I waited and tried a second Color Oops process, with the same auburn results. This time, I used a protein filler afterwards then tried bleaching my hair a bit lighter with a bleach wash. The bleach wash was tinted with blue to help combat brassiness, but the blue in the bleach turned my hair back to black instead! Not a single hair lightened from the bleach! So now I am left with black hair again that is a whole lot worse off than before I started. My hair is not fried or dead from all this... but it is not as soft as usual. So it&#x27;s safe to say I can restore my hair even after all this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take my advice, be prepared to take a chance when using Color Oops.&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to rinse, rinse, rinse, and rinse for almost 30 mins! You will be a raisin after being in the shower that long!&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared that your hair can darken even days after you remove your color. Color molecules not fully removed can come back and bite you in the butt!&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared that if you re-dye afterwards (or bleach like in my case) your hair can turn darker again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to wait a long while before attempting to remove my black dye again. Lots of deep conditioning with virgin coconut oil and keratin treatments in my future.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I hate Color Oops, but I do not think it is the color remover for me. I will be using a different color remover that does not use the same process as Color Oops in the future.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me but I guess it only works to varying degrees on taking out darker colors Not lighter ones. For the price I thought there would be more of the one application paying for. And you definately want to get a deep conditioner to apply to your hair after using this product. Overall it appears you may or may not get some to most removal of DARKER COLORS/SHADES with this product -it&#x27;s rather hit or miss. I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product worked at first but give your hair a month and it slowly goes back to original with each washing.  And it fried my normally smooth soft hair.</li>
    <li> Does not work! ! Turned my hair orange, even though I was trying to get black out from base color of brown... WHAT?!?</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable product. It removed my 2 month old red henna jobs. had golden bronde (blonde/brown) hair. I was convinced to go red with henna. After 2 months of henna- I realized it was looking orange and NOT good against my skin color. After seeeing what others did to REMOVE the henna  - I got the required products/stuff to do this with: Bottled lemon juice and Color Oops. I soaked my hennaed hair in lemon juice with 2 plastic shower hats and left it on a 1-hour (with towel to catch drips). I did this 3 times in one week and this visibly faded the henna. Then on a Friday I applied the Color Oops on my dry hair. I followed the insructions. But I rinsed w/warm water then soaped it up with dish soap! Then rinsed another 15 minutes. The henna is gone and im left with a &amp;#34;after you bleached&amp;#34; color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde who&#x27;d been dying my hair red (Loreal Excellence 8RB in case anyone cares) for about a year and a half.  While I loved the red color, I got tired of all the work to keep it up, and shelling out money for it.  After doing a search on color removal products, I settled on this one since it seemed to have the best reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, I got a bit nervous because the instructions inside the box said if you have thick or long hair, you might need two bottles-worth to get out all the color (which it did NOT say anywhere on the Amazon page, grr), and I&#x27;d only purchased one (I have an overabundance of hair that reaches the middle of my back). But, I pressed on since I figured I&#x27;d be able to sneak out the next day and buy more if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, and waited around 20 min before washing it out, making sure to strand check often. I became a little more nervous because it didn&#x27;t seem like the color was coming out at all, and every time I reached under the shower cap to pull out a strand to check, the pungent smell of rotten eggs hit my nostrils. Then, when I got into the shower and started rinsing out my hair, I didn&#x27;t see any color going down the drain, just clear water. The texture of my hair was also really bad (I think hay might have felt like silk in comparison).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, when I checked some of the hair at this point, it did look blonde.  So, as per the instructions (and especially since other reviewers highly insisted the instructions be followed precisely) I rinsed my hair out for the entire length of time I was supposed to and lo-and-behold, when I dried my hair and had a chance to inspect it - it was blonde!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up putting around a giant palmful of Argon Oil into my hair to combat the dryness, and it&#x27;s still somewhat dry the next day. I also neglected to remove the trash with all the different items from the Color Oops bottle, and boy does my bathroom smell bad the next day because of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, if you want an effective color remover, this is the product for you. Just be sure to have a super strong conditioning agent on hand for afterward, and be prepared to toss out the trash that very same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And really do follow the instructions about rinsing time - even after all that time, I still have a faint smell of rotten eggs in my hair...</li>
    <li> First; many thanks to all those who took the time to review Color Oops in detail - that was very helpful for me to decide to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am, lets say, &amp;#34;getting older&amp;#34; and got an awful lot of those &amp;#34;platinum blonde&amp;#34; (I refuse to call them &amp;#34;gray!&amp;#34;) hairs making their own highlights in my otherwise light brown with natural red highlights, medium shoulder length hair.  I usually only color my hair twice, maybe three times, a year - at home as a single mom who has time or money for the salon when there&#x27;s kids to feed and bills to pay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, having a few days off but not a lot of money; decided to &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; myself to my Spring-time coloring; had chosen what I thought was a nice shade of medium auburn.  Turned out; for whatever reason - the color I ended up with was a dark brown, almost straight black, with burgundy tint!  And as much I as love the color purple - in my hair for other than a holiday - NOT so much!  It might have looked lovely on someone else; but was 1) entirely too much burgundy in it for my taste; 2) entirely too dark and drastic a change; and 3) worse; a horrible waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed, not to mention horrified every time I looked in the mirror.  I tried shampooing my hair several times; no use; that purple didn&#x27;t want to go anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to go back to work and have to face the (well meant) teasing of turning myself into an aging Snow White; and with few hopes of finding any help other than Time - I did an online search; and found reviews on an amazing product:  Color Oops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hesitant to &amp;#34;throw good money after bad&amp;#34;; I read reviews; watched YouTube videos; and thanks especially to the reviewers here who gave such good details of their experiences (and RoseRed; bless you for your honesty and humor!); I trundled out to the local store; still rather un-sure after some of the reviews if one box would be enough.  Since funds are limited; I boughtjust the one box and hoped it would be enough.  It was!  My hair was thoroughly saturated with it.  It is; as others have said; very &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; consistency; so be careful to avoid drips.  Maybe I have a cold; or a poor sense of smell; as it wasn&#x27;t nearly as stinky as had expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly read the directions - and YES you MUST do a strand test to determine the amount of time to leave the C.O. on your hair!  Mine was 12 minutes; and actually I think if I&#x27;d only left the C.O. on for 9 or 10 it would have been perfect &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34;; as with the natural reddish I have to my hair anyway; slightly less time I would have had the light auburn I&#x27;d wanted to begin with!  But; with only one bathroom in a full house; had to wait that extra 3 minutes for the room to open; so ended up with a little too light, almost bordering on strawberry blonde.  So if you are NOT wanting to go reddish-blonde you will probably need to purchase another - LIGHTER than you want - hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed how well it took out the brown/black, and thank the Heavens - the purple!  I actually sat and debated on re-coloring; let my hair dry naturally and decided though I didn&#x27;t mind the reddish-blonde; it was just a hint *too* blonde for my coloring; so used a box of the lightest &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; brown I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I re-colored; I only used half the colorant in the bottle added to the developer; and; having read reviews cautioning against leaving the new color on too long (your hair is really porous after using the C.O., so will take a new color &amp;#34;faster&amp;#34;; pay attention in the instructions on the C.O. - it says don&#x27;t leave the new color on the ends for longer than 5 minutes).  I started the new color on the top of my head (all those &amp;#34;platinum blonde&amp;#34; streaks were back in full force) and worked towards the ends; being mindful of the caution about not leaving new color on too long or it&#x27;d be too dark; and could tell by looking; by the time I&#x27;d finished the ends; the top of my head was &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; - so I don&#x27;t think I left the new color on for more than 5 minutes total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed the new color out; rinsed well; and repeated - followed with the included conditioner I left on for 5 minutes; rinsed thoroughly again for another 5 minutes; towel dried and combed.  I didn&#x27;t notice any breakage or major damage; though the ends looked a little &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;, so I sprayed on some leave-in conditioner on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final result:  woohoo and a huge &amp;#34;thank you!&amp;#34; to Color Oops for getting rid of the &amp;#34;oops!&amp;#34; in my hair - and thanks to the new color (I used &amp;#34;Nice n Easy&amp;#34;, light neutral brown); my hair is much more back to normal - just looks like I touched it up a bit to get rid of the &amp;#34;blondes&amp;#34; but has nice highlights and just enough of a hint of my natural red to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my experience is a positive one too with Color Oops - and will definitely keep it in mind if in future there&#x27;s another &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; moment!</li>
    <li> I have naturally medium blonde hair that had been dyed MANY times over the years. My hair was 3 different blonde colors. Tried to do all over dark ash blonde color, ended up with PURPLE streaks!! Used Color Oops and my hair looks awesome. I didn&#x27;t even recolor! Roots are a tad bit darker than the rest, but I have honey blonde hair again. Just a word of caution; follow the directions exactly and do a strand test first. Wash for AT LEAST 20 minutes. I know its a long time but those few minutes can make a huge difference. You have to rinse all the color particles out for it to work. You can even recolor the same day if you have some orange, but you should get a protein filler from a beauty supply store before you recolor. Good luck everyone:)</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will. It took the color out of my hair. I only had a few sections that were growing out that were too dark from a dye job accident. I didnt feel like waiting any longer for it to grow out fully so I used this product. It worked great and lightened the dark parts. However, it did take out my natural color also on the sections of hair that werent dyed dark. With that said my dark brown hair was a strange reddish brown. I dyed over it and the color was perfect. This might be my favorite color ever actually. My hair doesnt feel damaged at all. I read the other reviews and made sure to wash my hair in the sink instead of the shower b/c I have VERY sensitive skin. My scalp was fine, no rash, no dryness. I am very happy and would use again if I had too. I gave it four stars just b/c the smell is terrible and when I shook the bottle as the directions said I didnt expect there to be a pinhole in the top and the Opps liquid went everywhere.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!!! I dyed my hair black a few months ago but wanted to go back to brown. This product removed all the black dye in my hair in just 20 minutes. My hair did not get any damage. To put my review into perspective let me add this: a few years ago, I dyed my hair blue black and when I decided I wanted to go back to brown, the hairdresser told me that only bleach would remove the black. I paid $150 to basically fry my hair. Even the bleach left some black spots. Not this product, it removed all the black. So go ahead and try it, trust me, you won&#x27;t regret it. Keep in mind to follow all the instructions to the T. though.</li>
    <li> I got a bit carried away on this review, so if you don&#x27;t really care about the background story, skip down to the \\&quot;COLOR OOPS\\&quot; Heading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:&lt;br /&gt;I have been coloring my hair for the last eight years, at least. It started when my sister was going to Cosmetology school and needed a guinea pig for jobs post-graduation. It started small, with blonde and brown and red highlights. (My hair is naturally medium brown with red lights in it and also lightens a bit in the sun). Then it got bigger. I dyed my hair many times, anywhere from brown to red. Then I wanted black.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I dyed it black I let it grow out. I experimented (I was 16 at the time) with a ton of box dyes, such as auburns and dark browns, and eventually went back to jet black. I liked the jet black and thought it looked good on me (it actually paled me out, in retrospect), so I kept it until I was almost 17. Then I wanted it out, because summer was approaching. I used a hair color remover kit from the store, by myself (I think it was L&#x27;Oreal Haircolor Remover). I didn&#x27;t apply it evenly, so I ended up with bright red hair at the roots (like I was supposed to) and jet black hair from the ears down. I tried dying over it and it failed miserably. Finally, after a few weeks of this freakish hair, I called my sister.&lt;br /&gt;She chided me for using box dye, and over the next several months, we tried using Salon quality \\&quot;color correction\\&quot;. Each time we used it, my hair got even more damaged and lightened only a very little bit. Finally I let her cut off several inches of my precious long hair as she said the only way I was going to get out the black was to let it grow out. So I began the process of growing it out. Periodically over the next two years, we added some brown and red highlights to try and lighten it up. I also experimented with a semi-permanent brown dye, which I found out permanently darkened my ends. However, I finally got to the point, after a year or two, where my hair was a little multi-colored, but it was a lot more brown/red, like my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MISTAKE:&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I took the nostalgia-related plunge to dye my hair dark again. Not black, but dark brown. (I know, I know, after everything I went through!). My hair was finally healthy again, since I stopped abusing it with all-over color. So, I went to my local salon and had my hair dyed (a level 3, I think). It came out darker than I expected, but I just shrugged my shoulders, knowing it would lighten up a few days after the salon. However, a couple weeks later, I saw that it was still super dark. It seriously paled me out. To boot, my hair was also damaged and breaking once again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DECISION:&lt;br /&gt;One night, I was laying in bed unable to fall asleep. I decided that I really wanted my hair back to its natural state. My boyfriend agreed, saying, \\&quot;As long as I&#x27;ve known you, I&#x27;ve never really seen your natural hair color.\\&quot; I got up, went on the computer, and researched my options. I only wanted to use bleach as a last resort, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on the salon \\&quot;attempt\\&quot; to correct my color (since it failed so miserably in the past). I also didn&#x27;t want to contact my sister, who hadn&#x27;t known I had dyed my hair dark again, because I knew she&#x27;d berate me for making the mistake. Finally I read the reviews for both ColorZap and ColorOops. There were more good reviews for ColorOops, so at 3:30 in the morning, I headed to Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR OOPS:&lt;br /&gt;I bought two boxes because I have hair down to my breasts and it&#x27;s pretty thick. However, I only ended up using one because I felt my hair was saturated enough and wanted to minimize damage. People are right, it DOES stink like rotten eggs...but that is bearable. I also did a strand test and decided that 20 minutes would be an appropriate time to let the product sit. I found the application to be a little messy, but then again I applied it myself. I also bought a wide-toothed combto make sure it was distributed evenly, AND Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle (always, ALWAYS my deep conditioner of choice).&lt;br /&gt;I let the product sit for twenty minutes, after I made sure it was properly rubbed into my ends. I shampooed for about 3 minutes straight and rinsed for twenty. Then shampooed again for another 3 minutes and rinsed for another 5-7 minutes (these are approximates). I got out of the shower, and even when my hair was sopping wet, I could tell it was lighter. I let it air-dry to minimize damage. I was SURPRISED!&lt;br /&gt;The color had completely drained out of my ends (a miracle considering all the abuse they took over the last few years). My hair looked like it was indeed my natural hair color, or close to it. Although, it DID turn out a little brassy, but that was OK with me. My hair didn&#x27;t feel like it was damaged much more, but I could tell some of my hair did break off. However, I do have impatience and a heavy hand with a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am VERY pleased with this product. I feel like it removed years of hair color, even though it said it wouldn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t even have to use the second box, although I waited a few days before making that decision. People warned that hair darkened up after a few days...my hair didn&#x27;t seem to darken up very much at all. I didn&#x27;t dye over it, because I feel my hair color now is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I vow that I will never dye my hair again. Highlights are a miniscule possibility. I just want my normal, healthy hair back. I believe that, with Color Oops, I am a lot closer to achieving that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT***&lt;br /&gt;After a week or two I did notice that my hair darkened back up a little bit, so I repeated the process with the second box of Color Oops. My hair was lighter again and it did darken up again a bit more. However, that&#x27;s expected since I played around a lot with black hair dye prior to using this product. I feel like it took out the majority of the dye but NOT all of it. Still pleased though - it&#x27;s not a miracle but it still does a great job.</li>
    <li> Both times that I&#x27;ve used Color Oops, It&#x27;s been an absolute savior! I used it once in High School (around 2005 ish) when I tried dying my lighter brown hair to black ... I got the wrong color black.. (Blue Black, YUCK!) annd it was a mistake.. It ruined dark hair for me so I used color oops and it stripped the color right off .. I didn&#x27;t even need to re-dye my hair because it brought it back to the lighter brown it was..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years passed ...I decided to try the black again..(2007 and on) I&#x27;ve been dying my hair JET BLACK and in the summer add some blonde highlights (A Clariol highlighting kit, works amazing on black hair ..just died or not and didn&#x27;t damage my hair too much) then I&#x27;d switch my hair to JET BLACK for the rest of the year until summer came along.. ANYWHO.. recently I decided that it would be OKAY to dye my JET BLACK HAIR (hadn&#x27;t been died for a few months) to a auburn brownish color .. to start the process of lightening my hair.. it was a HORRIBLE idea. Needless to say there were patches of Redish Brown in my STILL jet black hair every where else.. It looked like a hot mess. So I went on youtube and watched a few \\&quot;black hair dye fix\\&quot; and Color Oops was the over all fix. I watched a few videos and debated on it for a few hours because I was scared that the patches of redish brown would still be lighter on top of the rest of my mostly black hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought well just try it and if it&#x27;s that bad, go get it fixed professionally. Lets just say I&#x27;m SO glad I tried this before going to a salon. It STRIPPED ALL of my JET BLACK hair which accumulated in the last 6-7 years AND there were NO PATCHES OF MISMATCHED COLORS from a bad hair dye job done just HOURS before Color Oops!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read and watched in the reviews that it is lighter on the top and gradually gets darker towards the end, but if you dye it, the color attaches so well that it&#x27;ll be a great fix (which is what I did in high school and I personally found that to be TRUE, I re-dyed my hair after color oops in high school and it worked AMAZING. My hair turned out even) BUT THIS TIME .. I will NOT be dying it. It did something REALLY cool to my hair where it REVERSE OMBRE my hair!! I love it. Lighter brown at the top and it EVENLY and GRADUALLY gets into this really pretty medium brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, what they say is true. Mix your bottles, put it on your hair EVENLY and take it upon yourself to make sure your hair is fully covered, wait 20 minutes (i was told by a friend to wait for as long as you like the shade..but i didn&#x27;t see the need to test the instructions) and make sure you wash and shampoo your hair out 3-4 times for 5 minutes or so at a time because if you don&#x27;t your hair will darken (those bad review people should have read the entire instructions sheet) I blow dried AND straightened my hair after the bad dye job AND color oops and my hair is still VERY healthy. No breakage or split ends!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I feel like so many hair products these days dont actually do anything. This one works though. I had dyed my dirty blond hair a dark burgundy, multiple times, and this brought my blond right back :)</li>
    <li> this product did not work for me. For quite awhile I have been dying my hair black.. It took some of the color out, but very unevenly. I&#x27;ll have to go to a professional to have it fixed.</li>
    <li> Gosh this worked so well but the smell is awful and it lingers I could barely sleep last night. It smells like rotten eggs and is hard to get out ( for long thick hair) I would use it again probably but the smell is really really bad</li>
    <li> So my experience. I put black stripes in my dyed red hair.... but for whatever reason, it ended up dying most of my hair black (even tho they were only small strips... I guess it colored the rest when rinsing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t much like it... so I used color oops to take it out. It lightened it, alright.... a lot. I was like, AWESOME! Ill use this stuff if I ever need to take the last dye job out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t re-dye my hair immediately, due to a lack of time. But slowly, the spots I used the oops on gradually got darker and darker again. Finally, I dyed it my usual dark red.... but the spots have gone back to nearly black again. No idea why it did that (but that makes it a big waste of money) and I gotta wonder what it would have done if I&#x27;d dyed it immediately after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be prepared to reek like the bog of eternal stench. And the worst part is the smell lasts and lasts and lasts. I swear, I could still smell it several shampoos later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I won&#x27;t waste my time or money with this... Ill just go straight for the stripper.</li>
    <li> Most of the negative reviews I have read seem to be due to a misunderstanding of what they are getting as well as a lack of general knowledge as to how the coloring process affects your hair in general. If you dye your blonde hair darker, and then use this product,you most likely are not going to end up back you your pre dyed hair. It doesn&#x27;t work like that.Dye that uses a developer (as most dyes do)  actually lifts your hair to open the shaft for the molecules to penetrate and thus deposit color,, so it usually is not back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, just whatever the result is from the process minus the pigment..so not your natural hair, and possibly not even something that looks like your natural hair.  Don&#x27;t expect to rinse it and have a beautiful color, as this usually isn&#x27;t the case either..it is a color remover, it does not tint your hair to a more acceptable shade suited more to your tastes..that is what you do after this remover does it&#x27;s job with additional dye. It is simply removes the color.  Even with a ton of rinsing (which you HAVE to do), if you are trying to rid yourself of a dark base, it will darken slightly, as it is next to impossible to remove all color (no matter what product you use!) unless you bleach it out, which is a whole different process. As for the smell, well that is simply chemistry, it is a sulfur based, and sulfur is what actually deoxidizes the pigment, so yes, it smells bad, but is necessary, so honestly, I don&#x27;t see it as a negative as opposed to a necessary evil .It does not linger much longer then 24 hours, usually. (those of us who have used perms in the past..it is no where near as strong as that smell, thank goodness!) It is watery, but I feel like knowing this  ahead of time is winning the battle, as I really didn&#x27;t have an issue applying it to my hair at all without dripping it everywhere. Lastly, use caution when re applying dye, and try for 1-2 shades lighter than your desired shade, as well as really keeping an eye on the development, as it takes significantly less time to develop then usual. A warmer color is generally recommended, as hair treated with oops tends to pull ash, or cool..so I would really recommend a strand test before applying more color to your whole head, just in case. This is a wonderful product, but one must really be realistic and have some working knowledge of how hair coloring and processing works to prevent disappointment.velopment, as it takes significantly less time to develop then usual.

    <li> It did what it said getting the hair color out, but even after washing it 3 times with shampoo my hair still smells like poop and I even slept with a towel on my pillowcase so I wouldn&#x27;t stink up the pillow. My fiance slept on the couch so he wouldn&#x27;t have to smell me all night. I hope the smell goes away today!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I needed, I needed it to help remove blue, but the instructions do say it&#x27;s not intended for purple, blue, or green type colors. Would have been helpful if sellers would have included that.</li>
    <li> Decided to darken my blonde summer hair after the blonde turned brassy and almost yellow in color.  I decided to go with a dark blonde color.  After coloring it my hair turned black but it wasn&#x27;t all black it was patchy some light colors and some black colors.  So I figured I would recolor my hair to a medium blonde.  Did that and it was a little lighter but still on the black side.  Again I went and bought a Medium blonde and after that color was finished I still was not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to research the internet to see if there was a product out there to remove the black from my hair.  I came across this product and thank god I did.  After using it my color returned to my natural hair color.  Very happy with this product I would definetly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works great on henna.  I  have been using natural red  henna on my hair for several years and just wanted a change, so i bought the product. my hair was a dark red and i wanted to go back to my natural light brown.  I followed instructions specific to henna removal online at this link http://forums.longhaircommunity.com/showthread.php?t&#x3D;85463. Very happy how it turned out.</li>
    <li> So, my 19 year old daughter decided to dye her hair. To set up the scene: She has/had beautiful long (mid back), thick natural blonde hair with many colours of natural highlights ranging from ultra blonde to golden brown. She has had the bottom layer of hair at the back dyed black for several years and loves it that way. A friend of hers graduated from Beauty school and my daughter asked her to dye her hair. Long story short...it did not turn out as expected. The result was an unnatural dark purple that did not suit her skin colouring at all. Some mothers out there will know how this feels and when my daughter said, \\&quot;Mom, it&#x27;s only hair.\\&quot; I nearly broke down and cried. All these years of babying this blonde mass of hair with expensive conditioners and salon treatments...out the door. Since the girl who did it is trained, she was able to obtain full strength professional oxidative (not direct)hair dye and mixed it herself. So, I started to do the research. I found Color Oops and researched some more. I made calls to salons and was prepared to spend a lot of money ($200-300) to have the color removed. None of the salons I called used a product such as Color Oops and altho they claimed their process was peroxide/bleach free, it would still wreak havoc on her hair and would have to be re-dyed.    Not all of the reviews indicated that Color Oops worked, but I could not find any that actualy said it damaged the hair. I found an article that explained the difference between all of the procedures and decided to try Color Oops at home. Hopefully amazon won&#x27;t remove this link...  [...]  After reading all the reviews and the info on the Developlus website, this is how we proceeded:  1) Purchased 2 boxes of Color Oops (since this was an emergency, couldn&#x27;t order from Amazon. In Canada, the most common store to find the product is Rexall or PharmaPlus. The Extra Strength was 12.99 CAD), detangling wide tooth comb, protein rich conditioner (Bed Head) and just in case, a clairol hair dye, As recommended, a shade lighter than her original hair colour and in a Warm/Neutral shade. (sorry, another side note...did this on a Saturday. Called the Hair Colour hotlines from the pharmacy to figure out what colour I would need. The only one open was Clairol! Garnier and L&#x27;Oreal seem to be closed on weekends)  2) Convinced my daughter that we had to do this...by now it was 5 days after the dye job.  - Prepped the hair by combing the knots out, got everything ready  - Mixed the first box and started applying from the roots quickly and evenly and used the comb to make sure the stuff was well distributed. It does stink, but it is not overwhelming.  -She has too much hair for 1 box, so I mixed the next formula and continued applying  -Loosely knotted her hair under the enclosed shower cap and started timing for 20 minutes (max recommended). We warmed up the house and stayed away from drafts. BTW, we did not do strand tests since my daughter is a little stubborn that way. I would not recommend this; we were extremely lucky.  - She stepped in the shower, rinsed, shampooed and rinsed for ALMOST 20 minutes. I wanted her to do another shampoo and 5 minute rinse and she claimed she had, but only 4 minutes elapsed from the time of the first rinse and her stepping out of the shower stall, claiming impatience. Her hair felt quite swollen at that point and appeared almost white.  - Applied protein rich conditioner and put her hair under the shower cap for about an hour.  - Rinsed once again and the colour had darkened slightly, to what looked like a strawberry blonde.  -Several days later...her hair looks almost as it did before she dyed it.    There is a slight strawberry tinge but no one has even noticed it. Even some of her highlights are back. The protein conditioner seemed to do the trick and her hair does not appear dry at all. She has not washed it since the reversal so that her hair can heal a bit. I am simply amazed with the results. She has no need to re-dye it at all. The portion of her hair that was dyed black, is a warm brown colour, but blends with the rest of the hair. She will re-dye it black soon, so it&#x60;s not an issue. I would definitely use this product again. But I hope I don&#x60;t have to.</li>
    <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t write reviews but I was so amazed from the results, I just had to share them. The History: I had wanted to go a little darker and ended up dying my hair a natural black using Revlon Colorsilk. Big Mistake. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, It&#x27;s a great product but for some reason it looked like I dyed my hair with a black shoe polish. It was so dark it looked fake..not to mention I&#x27;m over 30 and Jet black over 30 yrs old is a big no-no it made me look older and tired looking. The color I had prior to the black dye was like a washed up brown (from a previous dye). I elected to go darker because from my experience dark hair looks healthier. Three weeks later, I was desperate to reverse the black dye and couldn&#x27;t afford to use a bleach because I have limp, weak,very thin and even thinning hair. So after doing research and reading all the mixed reviews, Scared and all I took a chance on Color Oops because of the advertised no bleach or ammonia ingredients. Yes, it has a funky odor and it lingers in your hair until the 2nd wash but the smell is really not that serious as some people claim and its worth enduring for the results. You have to follow the instructions on the box to the T and that includes rinsing your hair for 20 minutes. I used clarifying shampoo and a deep conditioner because I read on a few reviews it tends to leave your hair dry. THE RESULTS: Shocked! My hair is in better condition than before and it looks healthier..and possibly even a little thicker and stronger than before!!  As for the color, My hair turned into a color I cant describe... a Light- warm-brown-with hints of caramel color through out my hair. I love the new color and It brightens my face. I didn&#x27;t need to dye my hair again. People have commented on how good the color looks on me and how rejuvenated I look. The results might be different for other hair colors like blue, purple, pink.. but I highly recommend Color Oops for black hair removal.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moWVR08A1XEE2Z]]I cannot properly express through text how I feel about this.</li>
    <li> i thought I ruined my hair by dying it a bright red!  I was horrified.  I researched the Internet, and found many people had used &amp;#34;Color Oops!&amp;#34;  I ordered it, and it came in 2 days.  It was easy to use and removed the red dye.  Thanks for this product.  It saved me! mw</li>
    <li> A few days before, I had made a terrible mistake and attempted an at home highlight job. Needless to say, my highlights came out orange, so I dyed my hair a medium brown to cover over the terrible mess. Unfortunately, the color came out Black and I was horrified. I tried everything to fade the color, ranging from a dozen showers and loads of Prell shampoo. Nothing helped. As a last ditch attempt, I purchased 2 bottles of the Extra Strength Color Oops for my fairly long hair (that hits a few inches below the shoulders.) I followed the directions, left it on for 20 minutes, washed my hair for 25 minutes, and hopped out of the shower. I didn&#x27;t care about getting my hair back to its original color at this point, which obviously couldn&#x27;t be done because of my \\&quot;highlights.\\&quot; I just wanted to be able to redye my hair a medium brown color like I originally intended. So, after the shower, the top half of my hair was orange all over, and the bottom was a deep dark brown. Almost in tears, I ran Color Filler throughout my hair and let it set for 20 mins. I then applied demi-permanent dark blonde heavily on my roots and lightly throughout the ends of my hair. After 3 minutes I jumped in the shower. I was terrified to come out, but low and behold, my hair was the medium brown color I intended it to be all over. Pretty evenly. My hair is still severally shades darker than my natural color, but several shades lighter than the original pitch black. Color Oops helped me---It didn&#x27;t get all of the dye out of my hair, especially at the ends, but it was better than nothing. I have learned that I will never color my hair at home again, and am saving it to the professionals! But, thanks Color Oops. You helped my hair look normal. Here&#x27;s hoping my hair can be natural once again in a year or so.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes to remove all hair color, I did not intend to recolor my hair, but if I had it would have worked very well. I wanted to let my gray grow out, instead I ended up with dirty blonde hair. It was fine but quite a change from my dark brown color.</li>
    <li> I read the full reviews on this product,  I wanted to go from darker brown to a lite chocolate brown without bleaching my hair and I ordered ... well the product did exactly what I was expecting.  If you have a lot of hair order two.</li>
    <li> Worked as I wanted.  Perfect results.  Follow directions and after shampooing condition heavily with a good conditioner, such as John Frieda&#x27;s Brilliant Brunnette and rinse.  Highly recommend for correcting too dark coloring.</li>
    <li> So I had been dyeing my hair black for almost two years and started to get sick of it. I read ALL over the internet that I was pretty much doomed and I&#x27;d have to wait for it to grow out since hair color removal systems wouldn&#x27;t work......... well I&#x27;m a rebel, and I decided to try this ANYWAYS.....    IT WORKED! It smells awful and kinda dried out my hair a little, but it pulled the black ALL the way out.....    But one thing that kinda sucked was that I had SO many layers of black on my hair as you got towards the ends of my hair that the ends were a DARK brown and as you went up to my roots it faded to a lighter brown....... so it wasn&#x27;t an even color..... but I&#x27;m adventurous and didn&#x27;t really mind it (I ended up JUST dyeing my roots a medium blonde so my hair went from dark brown at the tips, medium in the middle to light brown/blonde at my roots)....... I got a lot of compliments with that hair color!  :P    One thing I&#x27;d say is it DOESN&#x27;T bring your hair TOTALLY back to it&#x27;s normal color....... but it DOES lift DARK colors out pretty well. If you have black in your hair, expect to see some shade of brown........     This will give you a nice palette to start fresh with. I&#x27;d say after you use it let your hair \\&quot;Rest\\&quot; for a couple of days (maybe even a whole week) before you do anything else to it!    AND, RINSE RINSE RINSE RINSE! (your hair is guna smell either way, but if you rinse enough it won&#x27;t be that bad!)</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY look up your dyes because APPARENTLY certain tones will cause the product to &amp;#34;attach itself to your hair and turn it green&amp;#34;...  Thanks Color Oops, you turned my color changeup into a major oops.</li>
    <li> After dyeing my naturally cool dark blonde hair for years first dark brown and then bright red (25+ layers of dye), I used Color Oops hoping to at least strip enough red out to dye it a medium brown and get closer to my natural color. Amazingly enough, Color Oops removed almost all of it! My thick, wavy hair is now dark blonde with a bit of a strawberry tint and SO soft. I am beyond impressed and may not put any other color over it at all!</li>
    <li> Color NOPE! Smells horrible and didn&#x27;t do the job as promised. 2 days later, the hair still smells bad.</li>
    <li> I used it in my hair four times and it didn&#x27;t work a single time I tried. my hair was a faded black when i started and a faded black when I ended. all I got out of it was a nasty af onion death smell. use splat bleach instead and just deep condition. color oops isn&#x27;t worth it. if possible I&#x27;d give a negative amount of stars</li>
    <li> I want to warn everyone that this is not a miracle treatment, especially if you have layers and layers of dark dye that you&#x27;ve built up over time.  However it does lighten your hair up a shade or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been dying my hair a dark brown for over a year (I have naturally light brown hair) and it has always turned out VERY dark, almost black. I have also been dying color over color. I decided recently that I wanted my natural color back. Of course I wanted to avoid bleach, so at first I tried the DIY vitamin C paste that you can find on the Internet. That worked to some extent but I wasn&#x27;t getting enough color out. So I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first mix the treatment together, it doesn&#x27;t really smell. But when you put it on your hair? It smells like something died. I don&#x27;t know what that smells like but I&#x27;m sure it smells equivalent. However, the smell fades quickly and you won&#x27;t smell it after you wash in a few days. Just to be safe, don&#x27;t do this treatment if you have house guests coming the same day because your house will stink like rotten eggs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important part about the rinsing process is keeping the water hot so your hair cuticles stay open (I believe that&#x27;s the right terminology) and rinse, rinse, rinse! I rinsed for 25 minutes and shampooed 4 times total, every 5 minutes or so.  Afterwards your hair will be crinkly and dry but it&#x27;s nothing a good conditioner can&#x27;t fix.  Leave the conditioner in for 30 minutes and your hair will feel great again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results, yes it pulled a good deal of color out. However my hair is still dark. I would have to do this several times to get close to my natural color.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair (mid of shoulder blade). My original hair color is a shade of black but I&#x27;ve been lightening my color in all shades of brown for 15 years.  I decided to dye my hair black again and it came out like a wig. It was horrible. I decide to try Color Oops. I waited two weeks, but after reading the reviews, I decided to buy two extra strength boxes (smart move because I ended up using both). I followed the directions to the T, making sure to wash out my hair for the full time limit (extremely important). I expected the water to run black but it ran clear. For the first two days my hair color was a dark brown with tints of red. Don&#x27;t freak out! Try not to dye hair right after. Go several days and use a high protein conditioner and leave in hair for 30 mins to fill the pores so when you dye it it&#x27;s closer to the box results. It fills the pores and gets rid of the redness. If you do decide to dye your hair right after using the product, go with a shade lighter than intended to get the intended result. The product reaks of sulfur, but goes away several days.  Btw...there was NO damage to my hair. Apparently the product only attaches itself to the hair dye and shrinks the dye color.  This product is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I dye my hair frequently - naturally it is a medium, mousy brown, but I color it a medium golden brown and have been for years.  I decided I wanted to dry a little darker for fall, but it came out a purple-y black.  A friend of mine recommended Color Oops.    I will say this.  It absolutely took the dark dye out of my hair.  However, it did leave me with brassy blonde hair.  Never in my life have I been blonde, and this is NOT a good look on me!  I was prepared for this though, and had a box of light brown dye on standby.  I left the brown dye in for only 5 minutes (your hair gets very porous after using Oops) and after rinsing, I was pretty much back to normal.  The roots of my hair are a little lighter, but at least I don&#x27;t have pitch black or brassy blonde hair anymore!    Overall, I suppose I would recommend Oops as long as you understand that it very much has the potential to turn your hair brassy blonde and you should probably have a box of dye ready for after you wash the old color out!  My hair does not feel damaged at all, it&#x27;s very soft, but I did condition like crazy after removing the color and adding the new color.</li>
    <li> I am a hair coloring addict. I constantly change my color, from blonde to red to brown and back again. When I started dying my hair over 10 years ago, the only way you could go from dark to light was my bleaching you hair. Not anymore! When I want to go from red or brown back to blonde (usually my color of choice) I turn to Color Oops. It has never failed me!! Depending on your starting shade, the color you end up with after Color Oops will be anything from brassy blonde to strawberry to light golden blonde. Either way, the color is easy to cover over. It does stink, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for what you get! It is also extremely important that you rinse your hair for the required 15-20 minutes, or your hair might darken over the next few days. All in all, color oops is a miracle!</li>
    <li> My hair history:   I have been dying my hair black since I was probably 15, I am now 26. I have used many different brands and many shades of black, as well as some crazy urges where I bleached out my hair and dyed it red, only to dye it black again. My hair has gone through the wringer, and after reading about the loop holes in the FDA the hair dye companies weasel thru and how unsafe and cancer causing the stuff is, I am done with commercial hair dyes. Nothing but henna now.   My experience with Color OOPs:  My results were minimal, though for me, satisfactory. It only stripped the most recent dye job that was done within about 4 months prior. The old hair dye was woefully untouched, though I could see it had been lightened. The stuff that was stripped away though had turned a pretty vibrant coppery red color. Lucky for me it is a flattering color and I like it, but for someone who doesn&#x27;t make a good red head, this can be potentially distressing. Bleaching with blonde dye however will net the same result on initial application, so at least color oops is less harmful. Really though, old black hair dye is going to be really hard to remove and it will take several applications.   Some things I really didn&#x27;t like:  The smell. This has a god awful smell to it, like the bowels of Hell, all sulphur and sickly chemical smell. I could NOT get the smell out of my hair to save my life and my whole place smelled strongly of it even after opening all the windows to air the stench out. I am not a big baby about smells either, but this was very strong and very hard to get rid of. Even after washing my hair several times over the course of a week I still ended up getting whiffs of it&#x27;s sulpheric smell day to day. I think it took about two weeks before I stopped smelling it altogether. Needless to say, even though it fades, your hair will not smell the best for a couple days.   Conclusion:  After seeing what little this did for my hair, I just decided to let it grow out. Sad to say, unless you are willing to subject your hair to numerous bleachings and turning it carrot red, it&#x27;s best to just let nature take her course in growing it. I had to dye my hair a brown as close to my natural as possible to blend the red spots back in, thus defeating the purpose. I do not recommend this to old dyers, but if your black hair dye was very recent and you don&#x27;t have old dye in your hair, you probably will get much better results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading all of the reviews, but when I used it on my own hair (which has been dyed black) it did not strip any color off at all. It was a total waste of money. Well, I suppose it did work to an extent. I read all of the directions and tips and it specifically says it will not remove \\&quot;direct color dyes such as bright pinks, blues, greens, etc...\\&quot;, and it did exactly that. It removed the teal from my hair no problem... Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair a very dark electric blue and after a week and many many washes I got it faded to a weird seafoam turquoise.  This product made my hair a really pretty blonde the first day I used it. However, I did not washout for the recommended 20 minutes and some of the blue/green has crept back 3 days later but I am still satisfied with the amount it did take out.  Bleaching alone could not have made this big of a difference and it is gentle enough to use on my already damaged hair. I cant emphasize the rinsing process though.  When it feels like you have rinsed for 20 minutes, rinse 20 more just to be safe.  I would definitely use this stuff again!!</li>
    <li> I just wanted to see if I could remove several years of color build-up. I chose Color Oops over a similar product because the Color Oops had better reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to plan this for a day when you can be at home all day-put dinner in the crock pot so you don&#x27;t have to worry about that!  I started the process at 12:50pm and finished at about 2:45 pm-and have not yet dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have used products lighter than my natural color, I did not expect to see a big difference. However,  once I started rinsing, the water was running dark red. I rinsed for 20 minutes and then shampooed and rinsed for another 5 minutes as directed. Still the water had color so I shampooed and rinsed again. The water seemed pretty clear, so I put on conditioner. I left my regular conditioner on for 5 minutes-when I rinsed, the water was again dark red. So I must have rinsed for another 10 minutes and then conditioned again for 2 minutes. Again, red water. Conditioned again and rinsed. The water was still a little red but I was just DONE. I was in the shower and my skin was turning to prunes, so I just decided enough was enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, my hair looks pretty good. My regular hair dresser had told me to be careful about re-coloring as the hair will be very porous and the directions do include this information. I have decided not to re-color now but will wait a week or so. My hair looks fine enough to go out in public and when I do re-color, I may just use one of the gray root touch-up products, as the main part of my hair is just fine as it is. The Color Oops seemed to remove a lot ofthe reddish color that had built up in my hair (altho I usually use an ash or neutral color when I color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very very thick hair. For others with this type of hair, here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You may want to buy 2 boxes of the product to be sure you can completely saturate your hair with the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Take a comb into the shower anduse it to part your hair to make sure you are getting the inner stands of hair rinsed thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Rinse from all sides-lean back into the shower and rinse from your forehead back. Lean to both sides and rinse from the sides. Also lean over and rinse from the bak of your neck. Keep rotating these positions as you rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Condition condition condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a final tip for everyone:  Be sure your timer is working and has fresh batteries (if it is battery operated). My timer died about 1/2 way through the first 20-minute rinse so I was reduced to the \\&quot;one thousand one, one thousand two...\\&quot; method of timing for the rest of the process. That was NOT FUN!</li>
    <li> I am african american with natural thick kinky hair. I recently bleached my hair and put a Demi permanent color on it to try a new color OMG worst mistake ever, turned BRIGT orange red!!! Who ever is responsible for creating Color Oops is a genius!!! It&#x27;s works like a charm does not leave hair damaged, smells bad but I&#x27;ve smelled worse! Conditioned my hair as normal for 15 minutes under the dryer! PERECT!!!! Would recommend to anyone and if I ever have another Color Oops this would be my first choice!</li>
    <li> It works good. But don&#x27;t leave it on for linger than it tells you to. Also after I rinsed and shampoo &amp; conditioned, my hair still smelled like eggs.</li>
    <li> I was looking online how to get rid of hair dye and get it back to my normal hair color. I came upon this product. Was totally excited since everyone said it worked perfectly. So I tried it myself. I did as the instructions said. I didn&#x27;t see any difference other than the fact that my hair had gotten darker. It was basically black. I was totally mad. My hair looked awful. How did it go from medium brown to black. Its been a week since I tried this. My hair also smells horrifying!!! I&#x27;ve been washing it 3 times to get rid of the horrendous smell. But it just won&#x27;t budge. So now I&#x27;m left with black hair and awful smelling hair. Hopefully it goes away soon.</li>
    <li> OMGoodness this stuff is amazing!!  I went to the salon to get my hair cut and dyed.  After it dried it was WAY redder than I wanted.  I bought Color oops and it took it right out!  It was dark red and is now a nice strawberry blonde.  I didn&#x27;t even have to wait the full 20 minutes for it to work.  Will definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> So, I must explain what I&#x27;ve done to my poor, poor hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is naturally dark/medium brown, and started at a length past my navel.&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided I wanted white/gray (aka: platinum) hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I began bleaching. Bleached about 8x, and toned about 4x. After a year, I wanted my pretty old long hair back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid damaging it further- I chose red Manic Panic, then later used Argan Oil natural brown permanent dye to get back to close to my natural hair color. It&#x27;s now been about 4 months since going back to brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So:&lt;br /&gt;Virgin hair - then white/gray/platinum hair - then bright red hair - then brown.&lt;br /&gt;Then wanted my blonde back..&lt;br /&gt;I heard of Color Oops and finally decided to put it to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STUFF EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS AS FAR AS REMOVING THE COLORING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once, for 20 minutes, not wanting my hair to fall out from so much processing. And I figured if it didn&#x27;t work in 20 minutes that&#x27;s because the Brown Hair Dye must have taken to my hair like glue, as my hair follicle and pores were so open and damaged, there would be no other way to reverse the coloring.&lt;br /&gt;I used it and WAS HORRIFIED at the result- my hair was a disgusting yellow/orange color, WTF?! I panicked and bought toner immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem fixed, lol!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not the WHITE it used to be, but is an extremely, extremely pale blonde again with only one application of: Color Oops, and Wella T19 Ash Blonde Toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-WORKS- well.&lt;br /&gt;-Didn&#x27;t damage highly processed (And I mean HIGHLY processed- I&#x27;ve bleached the same hair this was used on at least 8x, not to mention the toning, re-coloring, etc.) hair.&lt;br /&gt;-More affordable than a salon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Still kinda pricey&lt;br /&gt;-Smells like a piss-pot from the 1800&#x27;s.. and your hair will too, for several washes.&lt;br /&gt;-Took a whole bottle for my shoulder-length hair.</li>
    <li> I read &amp; reread the directions and applied all over, left it on for the directed time, &amp; it barely made a dent. Buy colorfix instead.</li>
    <li> At age of 50 something, have been dying my grey hair mahogany -dark red (which looks great on me!) for 8 yrs. It has become just too much to maintain with my roots growing in whiter in the front now. It seems true that darker colors make you look older as you age, being fair skinned. Want to change hair color and new i had to strip the red out. So many people here said the smell of oops was rank...i disagree. Hair dye smells worse! This product stripped the red out and left me with a beautiful light golden bronze color and i look younger alright!! Now i can start fresh and see how my roots grow out from this color. Maybe i will go blonder! Great product; my hair does not feel more damaged at all.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever posted. The previous reviews were extremely helpful to me in deciding to try this product so I wanted to add my favorable review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I could not be happier with it. I followed the instructions in the box, also taking into account the reviews here that stressed the importance of rinsing for the full specified time. It took the &amp;#34;too dark semi-perm. brown&amp;#34; out of my light brown, 53 year old hair. I&#x27;m back to my original color so can start again with a lighter, more accurate shade of brown. My hair feels fine, not damaged at all. I have average thickness hair falling just above the shoulders. One box was plenty. I am really pleased with this product and will definitely use again if needed.</li>
    <li> My hair drama....&lt;br /&gt;I had highlights done at my salon, but couldn&#x27;t afford to maintain them....so I tried to dye my hair to its natural medium brown using  semi permanent drugstore dye.  I was not thrilled that it came out a deep auburn color.  Still, i figured it was semi permanent and looked forward to it fading away.  I told everyone it was just a fun short term change and faked my smile as my hubby called me \\&quot;big red\\&quot;.  I read that if you use selsun blue in the brown bottle it will fade faster...but NO!  8 weeks later my hair was still auburn, but now I had medium brown roots growing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to the drugstore and found color oops.  I was terrified my hair would turn orange, but figured if it came out bad I&#x27;d hang my head and go to the salon and deal with the snarkyness of a \\&quot;professional.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions,ignored strand test, mixed it in a bowl, and slopped it on with my gloved hands.  It is runny, and stinky (but not as bad as others said).  The 20 minutes of waiting and 20 minute shower was agonizing....but the results were great.  My hair is back to its normal medium brownish, a very slight reddish hue in certain light, one color throughout (no evidence of the growing out highlights).  My roots are a little darker, but not too noticeable.  I used an expensive salon high intensity conditioner after and my hair feels very soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color oops definitely saved me!</li>
    <li> I foolishly decided to darken my nice blonde (bleached/highlighted) hair to look more like Eva Mendes.  The (professional) color job came out dreadfully ashy.  None of the home remedies that I tried worked very well (coconut oil, clarifying shampoo and dandruff shampoo), so I took a chance on Color Oops.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I also had some grays.&lt;br /&gt;Results: My hair came out a darker blonde than the original shade, but I am pleased with it. It is a world better than the mousy brown I sported for a month. Perhaps because I was so ashen before using the Color Oops, there was NO BRASSINESS, which was a relief because that seems to happen to a lot of people who post reviews here.  My grays returned to the previous blonde, with a bit of gold, but no brass. There was also NO ADDITIONAL DAMAGE to my already roughed up hair. This product says what it says it will do, so long as you follow the instructions precisely.  Rinse, rinse, rinse.&lt;br /&gt;The one crazy caveat to this effective treatment is its vile smell; it smells of sewage! You have it on your head for twenty long minutes, then rinse it for twenty (minimum, or your hair may return to it&#x27;s darker, not-so-hot shade) and I tell you, the smell lingers in your drainage system. Overnight. It stinks so bad that my husband was googling ways to remove the smell... but it can works wonders in restoring your previous hair color. The steeenk may be worth it! Besides, it costs a LOT less than a professional color correction. Amen.</li>
    <li> Yes, this got the black out finally. People. Sad sad people who dyed their hair black and got sick of it. Let me share my wisdom. You don&#x27;t have to bleach you&#x27;re hair. This will do the trick . Dying your hair black is like drawing with a black coloured pencil. It&#x27;s not going to come off if you try to dye it another color. It may work after a week but not at all. You&#x27;ll just be breaking up your hair worst by trying all these different colours. So just use this and then dye it over and your worries will wash away. Don&#x27;t say I never warned you.</li>
    <li> I purchased two boxes of Color Oops to remove black hair dye. My hair was left a very brassy brown/red color. I have tried to cover it with a dark ash brown hair dye 3 times ,and I&#x27;ve also been using toners to remover the red/gold and nothing helps ,my color is brassy and very uneven .</li>
    <li> As I age I find my eyebrows fading and have them touched up by my hairdresser, as well as sometimes doing it myself. Unfortunately They often come out too dark and I look as if I have two caterpillars on my face.  Oops! Carefully used lightens them.</li>
    <li> horrible product. Completely destroy my hair. I have to dye my hair black because the color was so uneven!</li>
    <li> It works. My hair was red and this turned it blonde. And I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair before I dyed it red either. So I didn&#x27;t think it would work but it did. You might have to put it on twice though to get good results. It leaves your hair smelling weird though but it goes away after a few washes. It&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> My husband wanted to color his hair but I knew better.  The next day he hated his hair color.  The Color Oops worked about 95%.  If there is a next time, I am getting two boxes. for him.</li>
    <li> Really works good if you goof up and put the wrong color in. This takes out that color you don&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> Several people have said this, but i want to emphasize it. I didn&#x27;t know enough about hair treatments to understand this at first, so excuse my ignorance, but maybe this will help another novice like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using oops to lighten dark hair, and if you end up with a frizzy, uneven, orange.red.yellow mess, and you want to put color back in to get to a medium color (and to smooth it out), you need to dye it twice. Here&#x27;s why. Once you have used oops, you hair will grab any dye put on it. A light brown dye will give you almost black hair. A dark blond dye will also give you almost black hair. Many people here call this \\&quot;porous.\\&quot; What I finally figured out is you can get around this problem by using a light blond dye first. Let your hair grab that. It kind-of seals your hungry hair, without turning it a dark color, so that you can then follow with a medium color like light brown or dark blond. So plan on buying oops, light ash blond, and whatever color you hope to get, preferably also in an ash shade to cut the yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t understand the other options people here talk about, like protein sealers and stuff, but i guess it&#x27;s the same principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the same approach works for me after a strong bleaching-stripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah. Don&#x27;t plan to stop at the ash blond stage. My hair was still uneven and yellow after the light blond dying and definitely needed the darker color to even it out.</li>
    <li> Last time I dyed my hair I made the mistake of impulse purchasing a new type of dye.  My hair is naturally red, and this new box appeared just a bit darker than what I normally do.  Despite using two boxes, it took unevenly and to my dismay, it was much darker and more vibrant than I expected where it did take(read - very unnatural looking).  Needless to say, I was very unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research, I opted to buy and use Color Oops.  My experience mirrored the majority of (positive) reviews.  It went in clear and smelled awful, with a consistency slightly thicker than water.  I left it in for the full 20 minutes, then shampooed, rinsed, rinsed, shampooed, rinsed, and rinsed some more while applying protein conditioner.  I applied the conditioner 3 or 4 times, because I planned on redying my  hair right away.  When I dried my hair, all of the horrible red was gone and it wasn&#x27;t any drier/more damaged than before!  My hair must have been somewhat damaged from the dyes, as it was slightly lighter than I remember my natural color being.  I applied the dye as usual, and it turned out fabulous!  It turned out a bit more brown than it usually does, but it&#x27;s a million times better than it was before and I&#x27;m so glad I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever want to have to do this again, but at least I know there is a product out there that can fix color mistakes.  Additionally, someone asked in another review about this removing pink/purple/etc.  There is a disclaimer in the instructions that says the product isn&#x27;t meant to remove these types of colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - if you need two boxes of dye, you&#x27;ll probably need two boxes of Color Oops.  I made the mistake of only purchasing one, which didn&#x27;t saturate all my hair, but it ended up alright because the color was concentrated near my scalp.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works very well and was gentle. Smells awful so use in a well ventilated area.</li>
    <li> I had been dying my hair red for years, I decided to go back to my natural color and used color oops to remove the red. It worked great, took the red out and I was able to dye my hair a nice light brown the next day. Don&#x27;t expect your hair to go back to your natural color, because permanent hair dye strips your natural color, so after color opps you are left with a not so nice orangey-blonde color, you will have to re-dye with your desired color. I didn&#x27;t notice any damage but the smell is quite awful. Also the 20 minute rinse seems like forever but I read if you don&#x27;t do it your hair could re-darken because you didn&#x27;t rinse all the dye out. I shampooed then rinsed for 20 minutes then shampooed again and rinsed for another 10 just to be sure and my hair didn&#x27;t darken at all. So be sure to rinse!</li>
    <li> color oops is a miracle worker! I dyed my medium blonde hair True Red from Garnier Nutriesse. I ended up with magenta hair that was speckled with blonde. It looked hideous. I was very apprehensive to use the color oops because I assumed it would be orange afterwards but after reading reviews I went for it. How could it be worse?! I used two boxes because my hair is very long. The application process is actually very easy and as everyone said it does smell a lot like rotten eggs but I didn&#x27;t find it overpowering. I left it for he 20 minutes as directed and rinsed for then washed 4x over 20 minutes continuously rinsing. Then I deep conditioned. The results are insane! I wouldn&#x27;t say that its anywhere close to my original color but it was a normal medium blonde with huat a little reddish tinge at the roots but it&#x27;s not bad enough I had to dye it again. I would strongly recommend this to anyone with a bad hair dye experience. thank you color oops for saving my fair from having it bleached in a salon!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about something that claimed to remove hair color without ammonia or bleach..I was glad to be proven wrong. Im naturally a light auburn but for several years ive gotten my hair professionally colored black (or various shades of dark brown with blonde caps thrown in) so when i decided I wanted to save money and start doing it at home and wanted to go lighter I decided to try this stuff. And it works great!! Not only did it remove years of black hair color but it does it without killing my hair (rinsing my hair with hard water for 20 minutes hurts it worse) and it doesnt smell horribly bad and I can color it immediately afterwards if i want. My local stores carry it but I had to leave a review for anyone interested</li>
    <li> I used this product last night, trying to make my hair lighter after having dyed it black a few times. I tried dying my hair black like 5 months ago liked it for a little bit but got over it, and my roots were back in force. Before that I had been dying some black streaks into the top of my hair and dying the bottom half of my hair black too. I figured I would either have to look terrible with my medium brown roots growing out with the rest of it being dark black, try to get it all bleached out and hate my life, or keep dying it black. So I decided to just dye it black again, but I really was over my hair being black. Luckily I stumbled across this and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t say that I have my natural color back, I can say that it is lighter than the black that I had been dying it! I didn&#x27;t need to re-dye my hair afterwards because I like the color that it turned out (a dark brown with some red undertones). My natural color is a medium brown with red undertones from the sun. I think that the back of my hair is lighter than the front, probably because I&#x27;m not the best DYI hair dyer so the dye back there probably wasn&#x27;t as strong as it was in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the smell, it&#x27;s not THAT bad. It definitely isn&#x27;t any worse than a box of hair dye. My bathroom stopped smelling like the stuff after I opened the windows and took out the trash. My hair still smells like it a little bit, but that&#x27;s if I smash my hair into my nose and smell for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got another box of this stuff, and if I ever put an ugly color in my hair I will use it right away. I think that if I didn&#x27;t have.... 10 years of hair coloring (a lot of different colors..) mixed into my hair this would have worked a lot better, like actually getting it to my natural color. I also think it would have worked better if there was less time in between dying my hair and using this product but oh well, it worked well enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part that really sucked about this was having to rinse it for so long. My water got cold after 30-35 mins in the shower so I&#x27;m hoping that my hair doesn&#x27;t get any darker, it has gotten a little darker since last night, but in a good way. I followed the directions as best as I could, shampoo&#x27;d then rinsed for almost 20 mins, shampoo&#x27;d rinsed then conditioned and rinsed but I ran out of time with the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that I&#x27;m going to buy some lemon juice and put it into a spray bottle and start spritzing some into my hair after I shower / before I blow dry my hair to lighten my hair a little more so it&#x27;s not as noticeable when my roots grow in again, but we&#x27;ll see.this was having to rinse it for so long.

    <li> This product is beyond amazing. I have naturally red/strawberry blonde hair and was trying to go two shades darker. It ended up PURPLE then faded to this gross brown. I was devastated. I saw this product and thought, for 12 bucks why not give it a try. It works AMAZING! Every bit of the color came out and my hair went back to it&#x27;s natural color! It did look a bit bright at first, but after the night it toned down. Another great thing is its&#x27; bleach free so no more damage to my hair than it already has. The only problem I had with this product: The smell. The smell was AWFUL. It smells like rotten eggs intensified. (I have put egg in my hair before and left it for much longer than this and it never got this bad) But hey, I&#x27;d go through two days of the awful smell all over again if I ever tried dying my hair again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work, at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Stripped it in one application.</li>
    <li> After attempting to dye my hair a light brown color...which ended in just giving my dark brown hair some red highlights, I wanted to correct the problem.  I had heard great things about Color Oops and decided to give it a try.  It did not work and it made things worse! First off on the box it shows going from dyed to natural, which would have been fine, because that&#x27;s kind of what I wanted.  This product did not do that. This product WRECKED my hair! Instead of at least being all one shade/tint/color, my hair goes from a yellow blonde to and orange/brassy red to a brownish red to a dark brown.  Basically I have the entire spectrum of red from my roots to my tips.  I would love to give this product zero stars. I now have to wait until I can schedule an appointment with a colorist out of town (the ones in town don&#x27;t know how to even style hair) and pay at least $50 to have the &amp;#34;correction&amp;#34; corrected. I would not recommend this to anyone, unless their goal is to look like a clown.  This is bar none, the absolute worst hair product I have ever used.  I contacted the company a few times and the company doesn&#x27;t seem to care.  A representative was supposed to contact back a few months ago and never did.  Basically the product is a waste and if you complain, they don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at a local store so my review is for the product itself and not the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this a few times in my life and it really does work well for removing color as long as your expectations are reasonable. My natural haircolor is a light brown/dirty blonde and for awhile i had highlights which I then colored with what was supposed to be a light brown permanent haircolor, but it came out way too dark, plus i really started to miss the blonde. Since I&#x27;ve had my hair lightened and then darkened, i knew that the end result was going to be a very brassy blonde, almost orange. I am ok with that as I will be recoloring my hair after a couple of days. I want to warn those people who are expecting this to bring their color back to their original: it is not very likely to happen. If you&#x27;ve ever used box color or had your color done with anything over a vol. 10 developer, chances are, you&#x27;re not getting back to your natural/original haircolor. This thing is supposed to and is very good at stripping your hair of artificial color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;- this is significantly gentler than using bleach or many other hair color removers. it is not supposed to lift your natural color. I have not colored my hair in about a month and after using this product i can clearly see about a centimeter of regrowth. Yes, my hair is a bit dry, but I expected that.&lt;br /&gt;- this is a lot cheaper than going to a salon for color correction&lt;br /&gt;- fairly easy to use. Mix the 2 parts together, apply. I find that the runny consistency makes for a quick application. I&#x27;ve read some reviews stating that if you want it to be less runny, you could simply mix in some hair conditioner, but I have not tried that method myself.&lt;br /&gt;- quick. I only needed about 15 minutes after i applied it until i could see the hair turning yellow/gold color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- stinky. oh so very stinky. you could open the window but only if it&#x27;s warm outside, since you&#x27;re supposed to keep your head in a warm-ish room while this is processing&lt;br /&gt;- annoying to wash out: they recommend that you wash it once with shampoo, keep washing it for 15-20 minutes (not seconds!) then condition, wash again, etc. 2-3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this for removal of color that is too dark. I have not had experience with removing bright colors or demi-permanent color using this. Get ready, chances are, your hair will be orange or have an orange tint, but the nice thing about this is that it&#x27;s gentle enough that you should be able to color soon after using this. Good luck!</li>
    <li> It is not a bad product but it does damage your hair to an extent and the smell is really bad I couldn&#x27;t get it out but I finally used an orange dish soap and it took out the smell. It is very true that you need to wash and rinse so many times I actually lost count. The application is is only 20 minutes but it took me an entire day to complete. It did what it says get the color out where it did get out the dark brown in my hair but it didn&#x27;t do so hot on getting the red out which is what I wanted. However about 3 days later more of the red was gone not so brassy and my hair is almost my natural color which is awesome. I am going to do a light ash brown and I think that will get more of the red out.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend because of the damage and the time it took. However I am still glad I did it because I can reverse the damage and I was desperate to get out the color. I would recommend if you have the time and your end result is getting rid of dark or black hair and you use a lot of keratin treatments after.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product yesterday. It doesn&#x27;t work the best but it&#x27;s not about its effectiveness. This product has the worst smell ever that i can&#x27;t even explain. My apartment still smells and my hair smells terrible. What kind of ingredients cause such a terrible smell, i don&#x27;t know but can&#x27;t be good. I regret using it. And i didn&#x27;t apply to all my hair, yet it&#x27;s really hard to get rid of the smell. My hair is so weak now. This product is certainly not good for your hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice now so far.  Worked great both times.  I was born a burnett but always wanted to be a blonde.  I have been blonde now for 12 years. I have bleach blonde hair, and wanted to go to more of a golden blonde.  went to a beauty supply store and purchaced a light golden blonde.  The woman told me this color would not give me the dreaded green gray hair you get with ash colors.  So I went for it thinking my hair would look so nice a light golden blonde.  I rinse out the hair dye, and guess what, my hair is this ugly green grey color. Yuck.  So today I went out and got the color oops knowing from a past experiance it works great.  I followed the instructions, left it in 20 mins and my hair is back to being a pretty shade of blonde, it even lightened up my roots that had grown in since dying my hair last.  My hair is not dry and lookes heathier then before I used the product.  The only bad thing is the smell, but so much better then looking like I have grey hair, Im only 31, too young for that, lol.  Great product so much cheaper then getting the color stripped at a salon that cost $$$ believe me Ive been there done that after making the mistake of going dark.</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is medium/dark brown, and I haven&#x27;t seen my natural hair color in years. Just in the past year, I spent the first six months dying my hair a dark brown-black, and then switched to a dark black/red for 4 months, and most recently a burgundy for a month and a half. Tired of reds and blacks, reluctant to use bleach, and just curious to see what my hair would look like sans-dye, I decided to give Color Oops Extra Strength a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I was expecting the product to stink worse than a backed-up sewer pipe, but after mixing parts 1 and 2, I noticed more of a metallic chemical smell with just a hint of sulfur undertones - it wasn&#x27;t roses, but it was very bearable and I didn&#x27;t feel like gagging or lighting a scented candle to ward off the smell. If you&#x27;re a child of the 80&#x27;s and ever got a perm, this smell is definitely nowhere near as stinky as perm chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice was how runny it was... compared to most boxed hair dyes anyway. I used a bowl and a hair dye application brush to apply the mixture, so I was able to keep the dripping to a minimum. It didn&#x27;t seem to bother my skin any, which is good since I have sensitive skin and bleach always irritates my scalp. The kit comes with a little disposable shower cap as well as gloves, so I was also happy to have something to wrap my hair in once I was done applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the product on for 20 minutes. I was tempted to leave it on longer, but the directions specifically say not to go past 20. The directions also tell you to wash your hair 3-4 times or at least for 5 minutes to rinse. I decided to wash 5 times in a row and then apply a conditioning hair mask to address any stress my hair had just experienced. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a super fancy hair conditioner. I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Triple Moisture hair mask and it left my hair very soft when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how well the product worked. I could see my natural brown on the ends of my hair where there had been months of residual black hair dye, and closer to my roots it was lighter (where the red hair dyes had bleached out my natural color slightly). I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be able to fix any lightening effects from the red hair dyes, but I was very impressed about the removal of all the darkness and red tones. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m starting from scratch again. I will note that the bathroom had a faint lingering chemical smell to it, but it was easy to get rid of by burning a little scented Febreze candle for a couple of hours. Thankfully, there is no lingering scent in my hair. I am very glad I gave Color Oops a chance. Especially since $12 beats $100 at the salon any day!n on the ends of my hair where there had been months of residual black hair dye, and closer to my roots it was lighter (where the red hair dyes had bleached out my natural color slightly).

    <li> I have darker blonde hair and usually get it highlighted. Last year I got strawberry lowlights and wanted them again for the winter, so I got highlights and very light reddish lowlights. This time the color came out fire engine red and I was not a fan. I was very hesitant to try color oops in fear that it would turn out even worse. I could not be happier with the results! Yes it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses (but I hardly noticed the odor and was expecting it to smell WAY worse.) The hardest part is rinsing your hair for 20 minutes straight. i just put in normal conditioner after following the instructions. My hair has returned to its normal color and it doesn&#x27;t even feel dry or damaged. If you want to return to your naturally blonde hair this product is perfect and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> OK, I dye bleach and treat my hair with many different things and colors. I have done nearly all the things you can to hair, and I still keep it healthy. I thought to give this stuff a try when I wanted to get rid of color without having to bleach again. Man..what a mistake that was! For a start, this stuff smells FOUL. If you&#x27;ve ever gotten a perm...it smells like that. And just like a perm, the smell stays around for days. It was horrid. Also, despite using semi-permanent dyes over bleached-white hair, this &amp;#34;color remover&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t even lighten my hair. AT ALL. I didn&#x27;t get any color removal at all. I used two boxes, as I have long hair, and I followed directions to a tee. I will never use this awful product again. On top of not removing color (that was only semi-permanent and faded) it made my hair feel extremely dry and straw-like. It took two weeks to deep condition my hair back to the condition it was in before I used this, and then I bleached and dyed as usual, and my hair was just fine. If you aren&#x27;t used to doing your own hair, please go to a salon. I know it&#x27;s pricey, but this stuff is just so horrible for your hair!</li>
    <li> Alright. I&#x27;m going to make this as straightforward and painless as possible. Let&#x27;s start with what everyone else seems to complain about - the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It honestly wasn&#x27;t that bad. The sulfur smell was apparent, but no more than a blown-out match - and not even that strong. It lasted longer, obviously, but it wasn&#x27;t too noticeable. Once you shower/rinse your hair, it&#x27;s really subtle. It doesn&#x27;t burn your nose like hair dye/hair bleach does, so I&#x27;d consider that a plus. And just FYI - I used the whole bottle on my boob-length hair, and I&#x27;ve got an incredibly sensitive nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, with that covered, here&#x27;s the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box comes with &#x27;little bottle 1&#x27; and &#x27;larger bottle 2,&#x27; as well as instructions, gloves, and a shower cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural strawberry-blonde, and I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair the darkest black I could find since I was 17. Bare minimum of twice a year - often 3 or 4 times a year. Sunday (01.20.13) I decided to try red. I found a deep red that wasn&#x27;t too coppery or burgundy, and, after checking the box to see if I&#x27;d need to bleach first, saw that it appeared to dye over dark-to-medium brown hair (I&#x27;d gone about 8 months without dyeing my hair, and the black had started fading pretty badly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay! No harsh bleach! My hair had stayed in pretty good shape for all these years, and I hadn&#x27;t been looking forward to frying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the box color (one of those Feria Intense Reds) DID dye my hair. It dyed my roots that perfect shade of red...and the rest of my hair just took on a red sheen. I basically had a red skunk stripe. But I was determined to be red. True, I could&#x27;ve just gone black over the top...but no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I got online, and for close to 4 hours, pored over every review and possibility - then decided to run down to WalMart and get some &#x27;Color Oops.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So on Monday (01.21.13, the day after I dyed my hair red), I decided to go for it. I read the instructions TWICE -(c&#x27;mon, people. I know we aren&#x27;t going to read the &#x27;Terms and Conditions&#x27; of anything, but WHY wouldn&#x27;t you read the instructions to something like this? It&#x27;s not anything you use on a regular basis, and I GUARANTEE the reason you had 1-star outcomes is because you half-assed it) - then did a strand test from the CROWN OF MY HEAD. The base of my neck isn&#x27;t constantly exposed to sun damage, friction while sleeping, and the first/longest strains of dye like the crown of my head is. The crown of your head will be the most difficult to strip, other than your roots. Strand test that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I got impatient with the strand test. Though I read that Feria uses metallic salts, shouldn&#x27;t use Color Oops, blah, blah, blah, (BS, just so you know) I figured that since my strand test didn&#x27;t start smoking after 5 minutes, I&#x27;d be okay... so on I went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me about 15 minutes to thoroughly coat my thick hair. I could see almost-immediate (by the time I&#x27;d gotten done coating all of my hair) lightening to my roots, but I figured since it was one layer of color, it&#x27;d be pretty easy to lift. I tucked my hair under the shower cap, wrapped an old shirt around it (to keep it warm, since apparently warmth is key to processing/lifting), and went outside for about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the Color Oops on for a start-to-rinse total of approximately 30 minutes. It says 20, but... I&#x27;m stubborn and I know my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shower time. I&#x27;m not about to bend over a sink or tub for 40 minutes while rinsing this crap out. I used the hottest water I could stand combined with a glob of Dove shampoo. Scrubbed my hair/scalp, then rinsed for about 5 minutes (I used my iTunes as a timer, and after 1 1/2 songs, I&#x27;d add more shampoo to my hair, scrub til that 1/2 song was finished, then rinse for 1 1/2 more songs). So many reviews say &#x27;rinsing is key,&#x27; and I believe that&#x27;s right. After all that was said and done, I used a huge dollop of conditioner and let it sit for 5 minutes before rinsingthat out, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While rinsing, I noticed the water wasn&#x27;t tinged with any color, so I started getting nervous. I figured if the color was going to &#x27;rinse out,&#x27; then my water should be pretty funky-colored, right? But nope. My hair also didn&#x27;t feel fried, rough, or stranger-than-usual. It actually felt pretty silky. True, it got a little drier the more I rinsed, but never anything as bad as it does when it&#x27;s been bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the shower until my hot water ran out - about 40 minutes No messing around and washing my body, shaving my legs, etc. I lathered, rinsed, and repeated. Sure, I danced around and sang to myself, but you can only count tiles so many times, dangit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from red-fading-to-black to blonde-fading-to-auburn. I didn&#x27;t expect such noticeable results - especially not where my hair was still super dark brown/black, but I couldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve been more wrong. HUGE results. Completely and utterly different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it remove the red, but it removed YEARS of black dye. My hair isn&#x27;t completely fried, nor is it orange. It may need some TLC, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as horrible as it would&#x27;ve been, had I bleached it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy with my results. I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone that&#x27;s had a &#x27;color oops.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;RINSE repeatedly in the hottest water you can stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty straightforward.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Gals, it really works! I have been cherry/ burgundy red for the last 5-7 years and I used this product to remove the red tone out of my hair. And it did remove my red! Now I need some toner to come down that brassy/orange tone to become ashy dark blond. Very recommended product.</li>
    <li> I have naturally light brown hair but  I&#x27;ve dying it jet black blue for years.  Decided to revert back to my natural hair color by using oops hair color remover. My hair is orange! This product is the worst. I could stand the terrible rancid smell if it did the job but now I have chola blonde hair. I already receive enough racists remarks through out the day, why not add add to it some more with this stupid disgusting hair color.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this stuff smells really heinous (think lemons, farts, and chemically burned hair) but it works!  I&#x27;m a natural blonde and have been dying my hair since I was 18 (I&#x27;m now 37). Black, brown, red...I&#x27;ve done it all. After deciding that I wanted to go back to my natural blonde,  bought extra strength Color Oops.  The stuff kicks ass. It removed the bright red dye that I currently had and left my hair a gorgeous blonde color. I fully expected this product to turn my hair an unnatural shade that would be corrected - but there was no need. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the awful chemical smell follows you around for awhile. It&#x27;s been 5 days and I can still faintly smell it in my hair when I wet it. Honestly, it&#x27;s worth it. My hair looks the way it did when I was 18.</li>
    <li> I originally have dark hair. But a couple weeks ago I went to a salon and I got a reddish burgundy color. I decided to go blonde and I purchased Dark and Lovely&#x27;s lightest blonde I think was the name. After taking out the dye the top of my head was pink and the rest blonde. I was going crazy looking for the right product that would get the job done. Color oops did that. When reading reviews and watching video&#x27;s I was nervous because some people gave complains about the effect of color oops. There is no way you can wrong if you follow the directions, which is leave in for 20 minutes and then rinse out for 20. I left in the color oops for 20 minutes exactly and I added some heat, not a lot so the color could really brighten up. I didn&#x27;t rinse out for 20 minutes I did about 10. After taking out the color oops you can&#x27;t tell a different until you start to rinse out. I shampooed and rinsed for about 10 minutes and now I am blonde.</li>
    <li> I am always dying my hair different colors but the dye I use bleaches my hair. This is fine for when I dye it bright red, deep blue, or even purple. Other dye removers strip the color to a brassy orange but this take out all of the color so that it goes back to the blonde base. It is also a lot safer on hair and doesn&#x27;t cause the damage the the strippers do. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to remove the color from their hair safely with minimal damage. You may need more than one treatment to remove all the color but it is well worth it. You can do multiple treatments a day to remove all the color.</li>
    <li> Did not work very well.</li>
    <li> Removed hair color with ease. Do remember to wash hair for 20 min or more. Otherwise the dye leftover will oxidize and re-enter hair shaft. Also if you used a dye other than semi-permanent it had have a bleaching agent for the dye to penetrate... Therefore making the hair slightly lighter. I rinsed the color oops out and my hair was slightly orange but I actually loved the color. But of course you can always re color afterwards</li>
    <li> I really regret ever applying this to my hair.. The product smells unbearably putrid and after enduring having it on my hair for about 25 mins I washed my hair. I washed it for 30 minutes straight.. then blow dried it and  realized the smell was still so strong that I actually went back in the shower and washed again for another 30 minutes.. Tons of my hair fell out and my scalp was burning..  I am not sure that this product is safe and what type of testing it went thru before being released for sale. Over the next 2 weeks I lost a ton of hair and my scalp continued stinging despite cocoa butter masks I was applying. My hair had that putrid smell for weeks after application. I washed with Loreal Kerastase Shampoo and conditioned it with Masque Intense, also by Kerastasse,&lt;br /&gt;In the end, due to damage to my scalp I could not apply another hair color so I ended up with an uneven color, short haircut and damaged scalp which I only hope will recover..</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully on dyed dark brown/black hair. Also if you had black hair and removed it with bleach to get that ugly orange brassy color, this removes a lot of the Orange. And no damage what so ever</li>
    <li> I used this product yesterday and I have to say it is amazing. At first, I have read a few reviews that talked about hair loss and damage and I was a little scared to try this product because since it had no ammonia and bleach it was too good to be true. After having the courage to buy it I woke up really early yesterday to do a strand test, which I think is very important to first see how the hair reacts, because everyone&#x27;s different. And after I decided to give it a shot and I used it in my whole head, not expecting much difference because I kept taking off the cap to see if my hair changed but it was still dark, but once I rinsed for 15 mins and I blowdried my hair, I begin to see a huge difference, my hair was very close to my natural color with orange tones. Which is perfectly normal since my hair has been dyed black constantly for about 5 years. Even though, when I woke up today some of the orange tones dissappeared and I was left with beautiful light/medium brown hair. I have been trying to change my hair from black to red for a month with loreal hicolor highlights in magenta, and the color was only visible in the sun, and in very bright lights. So I needed to get rid of the black first and this product was my only option because I refused to use bleach on my already damaged by heat and fine hair. Now I can easily dye my hair to the color I want.  P.S the smell is really really bad, that&#x27;s the only thing I did not like and it will stay for a while, but today when I woke up it was almost gone, so it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I washed my hair twice with a lot of shampoo and at the end deep conditioned my hair with a coconut oil deep conditioning mask and it made my hair smell much better and it feels really smooth and silky. I did not get damage at all with this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased mine from Bed Bath and Beyond. I had a few years worth of black (which I think I removed most of with a Vitamin C treatment at home - google it), dark browns and reds. So I decided to &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; myself to the salon. I wanted to go a dark auburn and took the box in and asked the stylist to make me that color. She said it would take a 4 hour treatment that day + another 4 hour treatment another day to remove the old color and she could not guarantee it would lift all the way or wouldn&#x27;t damage. And this would be up to $250 for the first treatment. She also said if I used the Color Oops at home that I would look like a cheetah. So, I left, went straight home and used the color oops :). It lightened me quite a bit and took all the &amp;#34;100 colors&amp;#34; I had in my hair (per the stylist). I picked a bright red to recolor with, knowing it would &amp;#34;grab dark&amp;#34;, per the Color Oops instructions, and only left it on for 5 minutes. Even though it&#x27;s not as auburn as I wanted it to be, I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I do not look like a cheetah and it only cost me $20. And I can maintain it at home, which was the most important to me. And let&#x27;s face it - 4 hours at the salon is not pampering... it&#x27;s torture :)</li>
    <li> This is nothing more than bleach!  It&#x27;s super damaging to delicate strands and doesn&#x27;t always remove the color completely.  This has been my experience.  While all color removers leave hair orange to some degree, this one left my hair as orange as Bozo the clown!  I would never use this again.  I have no earthly idea why it has so many good reviews on Amazon!  It astounds me that people would actually think this is a good product.  It left my hair as damaged as if I had bleached it ten times in a row.  I have since found two much better products.  For slight lifting of color (a level too dark perhaps) Malibu Color Corrector packets are a godsend.  In about 15 minutes, it lifts permanent color one level and completely removes demi permanent formulas.  It comes in packets that are mixed with water to form a soapy mixture that is applied to shampooed hair. For shoulder length hair, you&#x27;ll need three packets.  After waiting about 5-15 minutes, the color is lifted out with no strange orange tones.  A big difference from Color Oops! And Malibu is available on Amazon.  For permanent color removal, there&#x27;s Vanish, which works by simply shrinking the color molecules so that they simply slip out of the hair.  There are two steps and Vanish is used with heat but it&#x27;s super gentle and will not damage the hair at all.  Yes, your hair will still be orange and you may need more than one treatment of Vanish, but you won&#x27;t be sacrificing your hair.  One package works on shoulder length hair as long as it&#x27;s not too thick.  Vanish is available on Amazon and although it&#x27;s more expensive, you won&#x27;t be sacrificing the health of your hair.  After using Vanish, you&#x27;ll need to neutralize the orange tones with a blue based color (blue neutralizes orange).  You might want to look into using Wella Koleston Perfect.  A 2 or an 8 to the right of the slash mark indicates a blue base.  Just FYI.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend Color Oops.  Based on my own experience, this is a terrible, awful product.  I hate to cut my hair short after using it and it&#x27;s taken years to grow back.  I strongly urge you to use one of the products I&#x27;ve mentioned, which I&#x27;ve discovered through trial and error.  Your hair will thank you.t.

    <li> I&#x27;ve done some pretty stupid things with haircolor in the past year, and if I mess up bad, this stuff REALLY WORKS. It can&#x27;t take out deep turquoise or purple, hot pink etc completely, but it doesn&#x27;t further lighten your hair. It leaves it feeling soft and ready to recolor, and really does take out your OOPS. If you&#x27;ve lightened and toned your hair it will only take out the toner. Nothing can restore your original color after bleaching, and MOST permanent haircolors (even dark browns and blacks) contain some bleach/peroxide to help set the color. You could still have a surprise in that your hair is lighter than you thought, but this is NOT the Color Oops - it&#x27;s more likely the color you put in your hair to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to re-tone afterward, especially if your hair goes orange/yellow after lightening like mine does. Don&#x27;t panic after rinsing! What you see is your &amp;#34;colorless&amp;#34; hair, and it will be ready for and take your new tone pretty well. Whatever you did to damage your hair will increase its porosity and so it can STILL grab color very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have color on top of color on top of color, you may need to repeat the process, or buy two boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be in the shower a LONG time rinsing the Oops out -- but the chemistry involved WORKS. It shrinks the color molecules so they can exit the hair shaft. So yes. RINSE RINSE RINSE. Run the hot water out! But if you&#x27;re about to cry looking in the mirror at what you just did to your hair? YES. Make sure you keep this fantastic miracle worker on-hand to rescue you from yourself. :)</li>
    <li> i read hundreds of reviews on here and on walgreens to determine if i wanted to use this product.  originally my hair was bleach blonde, then dyed over that a light auburn, and then a darker brown, and then a really rich, deep red.  i am naturally a blonde, and didn&#x27;t feel like having blonde roots and bright red hair, so i decided to give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first of all, it doesn&#x27;t even smell that bad.  if you have used regular hair dye, which can smell really harsh, this product certainly doesn&#x27;t smell worse than that.  if you use the hair cap it came with, throw the bottles away after using them, and shampoo and condition your hair, it&#x27;s really not as awful as everyone has claimed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would highly suggest doing the strand test before using the product because it gave me a really accurate representation of what my final color was going to be like.  the rinsing is tedious, but it wasn&#x27;t the end of the world.  my hair was not that dry after using it, and certainly very soft and back to normal after conditioning.  this product did not damage my hair the way that bleach would have, and for that i am really glad that i used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as the color goes.... it came out a very natural looking red.  think a 13 year old lindsay lohan.  the shade and tone are very even.  the color is slightly brassy, but my hair was also a dark red before i used this product.  it lightened my hair about 4-5 shades.  originally i was going to dye it a very dark blonde so that i would have a final color of light brown, but this color is actually so unique and cute that i am going to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend using this product, and i am kind of sad i didn&#x27;t find it sooner.  it definitely beats using harsh bleach on your hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally dirty blonde. I have been dying it an ash blonde for years to get that bright blonde color. I always make these mistakes where I think \\&quot;I need something different.\\&quot; I have this feeling about once every 2 years and I always regret it!&lt;br /&gt;Well a couple days ago, I had this feeling and tried to dye my hair silver. Let me just say, if you are going to do something this drastic, get professional hair color instead of Sally&#x27;s. Needless to say, it did not turn out right. It was so gray it looked completely blue! I kept it like this for 1 full day. After that I put some more ash blonde on my roots and golden color on the ends to try to take away the blue. This sort of worked but I was not happy with the color. It just wasn&#x27;t me. I was very upset until I read all the reviews about Color Oops! I thought the reviews were just too good to be true!&lt;br /&gt;They are True though!! The next day I got some Color Oops. The smell isn&#x27;t great, like all the reviews say, but it&#x27;s not unbearable. The hardest part is the rinsing...but it is the most important. I left Color Oops on for the recommended 20 minutes and I could already tell it was working after about 5. I didn&#x27;t do a strand test because I was so unhappy with the color I thought even brassy was better than this!&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, the rinsing was horrible!! I almost passed out but it was totally worth it. I rinsed for a couple minutes, Shampooed, rinsed for 20 minutes, Shampooed, rinsed another 5 minutes then conditioned and rinsed some more. I then put some leave-in conditioner on my hair. I felt completely the same! hardly any damage at all!! And all the gray and golden color was gone! I couldn&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;It was very brassy all over so I knew I would have to dye it again to get a color I was happy with. I then dyed my hair the same day with the color I normally do. Before all this happened, I would leave the dye in my hair for close to an hour. I only left the color in that day for about 10 minutes and it dyed it better than it ever has!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Color Oops saved my life!! I can&#x27;t believe I had never heard of this before!!</li>
    <li> I had pitch-black hair dye, and my hair is very thick and porous/dry.  It clung onto my bangs, yet faded everywhere else in my hair.  I looked so silly.  I gave this product a try, and it worked fabulously!!  I absolutely love and would highly recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair excessively.  Nothing some conditioner didn&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;* It smells bad, but the smell has faded away in one night with the help of Herbal Essences rose hip conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;* It took 20 minutes to process.&lt;br /&gt;* It took 20 minutes to rinse.  Shampoo for 5 and rinse again for 10.&lt;br /&gt;* I could see the results RIGHT AWAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!! :-)</li>
    <li> I am a natural blond and in December of last year I decided to do a bold new cut and colour to boot. I coloured my hair a vibrant red with permanent colour and figured that as it grew out I would do touch ups with semi-permanent colour that would wash out. So about 8 months down the road there was no sign of fading and I was tired of having to constantly re-colour my hair. I searched the internet high and low for a solution to removing the colour but my choices in Canada were only a few home remedies or spending hundereds of dollars in a salon (no thanks!). I stumbbled accross reviews for this product and decieded to take the plunge (it couldn&#x27;t be worse than bright red hair with a blonde stripe down the middle). I bought two bottles just in case and tried it out. I was AMAZED by how well it worked. I did have a little bit of darkening and used my second box. It has been three weeks now and I am satisfied with my light strawberry blonde hair, in fact you can hardly notice any grow out at all. All-in-all, if you&#x27;re a blonde - TRY IT!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair what was supposed to be light brown/red. It ended up black and purple. I used Color Oops, and it made me super blonde. It didn&#x27;t take me back to my natural hair color, but it did make me a bleach blonde, minus the damage. My hair is super soft. It smells like egg farts, but it does work.</li>
    <li> Since I like may of the reviewers here read about others experience before taking the plunge and I thought I add my experience to possibly guide others as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally dark brown hair, between level 2 and 3.  I stopped plucking the grays when they ganged up one me any started to dye my hair.  I&#x27;ve been happily using Perfect 10 darkest brown and dark brown for a couple years.  Recently I felt the bottom portion (dyed who know how many times) looked dull black.  I was thinking of stepping to the medium ash, lightening up a little for summer (the ash to counter the natural red/coppery effect my hair can get) but noticed the 1/2 up to dark brown did not lighten my hair it just kept adding pigment so enter oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a strand test and it looked like it was just going to lift the darkest, leaving me with pretty darn close to my natural shade.  I was ready to go with all the necessary tools (opps kit, wide tooth comb, protein conditioner - I had some Bumble and Bumble Deep - and a box of dark brown dye in case it was scary)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the smell has been covered.  It&#x27;s not pleasant but not a deal breaker.  I left it for 20 minutes just as I did my strand test.  Yes, rinse, shampoo and repeat until the water runs cold...that long.  During rinsing my hair started to feel straw like and matted but kept rinsing adding some conditioner as I went.  After rinsing I towel dried my hair added a healthy amount of protein conditioner and some left over conditioner from my last dye box put on a shower cap and hung out for 15-20 minutes and rinsed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results...coppery reddish medium brown (all but the roots that were overdue).  My hair does not feel dry or brittle as I feared during the rinse process so maybe the heavy conditioning helped.  My hair was fair before the process, not in perfect health shape but not overly dry either.  It actually feels quite soft - and it&#x27;s shiny!!  possibly the protein conditioner while the hair shaftswere still vulnerable and removing years of dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read it so I was prepared - but want to reiterate it.  Because I don&#x27;t want people thinking they will get their old hair back.  Since all permanent dyes have peroxide to aid in binding to your hair it will not come out your virgin/natural color especially if you&#x27;ve dyed repeatedly.  Your hair has been changed.  Even if you&#x27;ve just gone darker like in my case oops will just remove the old darker dye and unmask what is left from the processing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy enough and it did what I expected.  Do plan several hours and I&#x27;d recommend using some protein conditioner (filler) and have a box of color just in case.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonderfully, takes the color right out, but oh my god, it has the most atratrocious stench! You can smell it for days! Seriously keep a fan on, febreeze on hand, and be prepared not to use the room you applied this in for days, possibly weeks. Also use clothes you won&#x27;t miss. Seriously this stuff smells horribly.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it had worked or not as I was just trying to get the brassy color out of my hair but whatever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair a blend of half dark brown, half natural black for about 10 years, and decided I wanted to go lighter. Maybe red? I just used this product for the first time, following directions carefully. It is very watery, compared to hair dye consistency. Yes, the smell is odd. I kept it on for 20 minutes, after a 10-minute-long application on my long hair. My hair is fine, so I did have a tiny bit left over, even after re-dabbing my whole head with the solution. You will need to rinse for a long time: 15-20 minutes, as the directions say. I shampooed 3 times during the rinse, and started noticing my hair feeling less slippery, like it needed a deep conditioning. That, to me, indicated that the rinsing was done, as the water is carrying away the color residue (I didn&#x27;t notice the water being any color other than clear, by the way.) I deep conditioned afterward, then added lots of leave-in hair oil, and used a blow dryer. My hair, surprisingly, after years of build-up, is pretty evenly the same tone of medium reddish brown. I am impressed. It says that you can color right away, but I think I want to acclimate to having lighter hair. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Okay I wouldnt say this removes all the color but it definitely lightens it very well. I had dyed my hair black and decided I wanted it red again. (I always do my hair myself) so instead of spending 80 bucks so the salon can bleach the heck outta my hair and risk more damage, I decided to use this risk free cheap option.  One application lightened it to medium brown, enough to put the red I had over it. Yes the smell is like eggs and vinegar. Throw the stuff out of the house when done so it doesn&#x27;t linger, and one wash and I had no bad smell in my hair. Its no big deal, and worth saving a ton of money for us less wealthy people who dont have money to spend 50 bucks every month on hair.&lt;br /&gt;It also got old red tones outta my hair very well too. If you are getting red out keep in mind thats the hardest color to get out unless you bleach it. Not even black dye got all my red hair out. So use two applications and you should be good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great for the money you save,&lt;br /&gt;And no damage. you can also use more than once if the first time didnt work enough. Just follow directions carefully. Your working with chemistry so it needs to be done right! No short cuts on rinsing either!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work much, only lightened my hair a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Worst part: smells like rotten eggs/poopy diapers. I&#x27;ve washed my hair 8 times and no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again, regardless of how bad the mistake is.</li>
    <li> So right now I am using color oops as we speak. I heard from reviews and videos that I have watched over the internet that it is suppose to smell really bad. Actually it does not smell too bad but I don&#x27;t know if it is because I had windows opend and good smelly stuff in my bathroom. But all in all the smell is not that bad and I don&#x27;t know if it is because too I have shorter hair then the girls that I watched in the video. here is to hoping it will get most of the color out.</li>
    <li> There were a lot of good reviews about this product so I decided to try it. I had medium brown hair, and I dyed it black. After a while I got tired of the color and wanted to go back to my original and this product was mentioned all over Google. After an hour of following instructions (20 minute wait and 40 min shower/rinse) I was done. The results were immediate. I could see red on the roots of my hair and I was a bit freaked out, but I waited for my hair to dry to see what it would actually look like. This was at 11 at night, so I ended up falling asleep. When I woke up the next morning my hair was a dark brown. It looked amazing. It was not my original color but I think it was even better. The color is even throughout my hair, which was something I was scared of. I didn&#x27;t want to have black spots. My hair, in the sun, seems dark auburn; luckily though it looks great. I would recommend this product. I had originally planned to re-dye it after using the product, but it didn&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Like others who resorted to using Color Oops, I read every single review on Amazon and Walgreens before buying a box from the drugstore. I found the customer feedback so helpful that I have to return the favor on the off chance that someone with a similar hair saga may get something out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ash blonde hair with salon highlights. My stylist dyed it brown with a red tone (to prevent it from turning green). After a few months, the brunette diminished and the ugly matte red tone remained. It was lifeless and dull, similar to the color of an unvarnished clay pot. Yes, it was truly hideous. I tried multiple natural remedies with disappointing results. Then I caved and did Color Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have covered the wretched sewer smell and the grueling rinsing process, so I don&#x27;t need to. The process is an ordeal and takes at least two hours from start to finish. Reading the directions is imperative. It&#x27;s helpful to use a timer at every stage of the process because it&#x27;s easy to underestimate how much time you&#x27;re spending in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a strand test beforehand, so I was prepared for Color Oops to fail. The difference in the strand was miniscule, but I fancied that I saw a slight lightening and went ahead with the full application. After twenty minutes, I imagined that I could see faint ghosts of my highlights peeking through. Overall, my hair color was unchanged. I left it in for an additional 5 minutes to see if more time would help. If there was change, it was very subtle. Fearing that my hair would disintegrate if I left this crap on my head any longer, I started rinsing. And rinsing. And rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I stepped out of the shower and blotted off my fragile, yarn-like hair, I noticed that it was slightly lighter. I examined my roots and still saw a clear demarcation where ash blonde meets obnoxious red, but it was a little less pronounced. After deep conditioning, rinsing again, and applying another leave-in conditioner, my hair looked a little fried but not too bad. As it dried out, the color seemed to improve even more and turn into a warm light brown that I thought was alright. I didn&#x27;t dye over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next couple of days, it darkened significantly and the overall change was very slight. And three weeks later, the smell emerges whenever my hair is wet or my body temperature goes up (while I am working out). I have washed it many many times with scented shampoo, so the leftover Color Oops smell is like candied farts. Sweet but sickeningly sulpherous. I am sad that I did this to my hair because it seems like it will never lose this cursed stench. It smells fine while it is dry, thank god, but that&#x27;s a small comfort. I think the smell has been an issue for me because I did not dye it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what chemical process made my hair so resistant to giving up all of its dye, but whatever it was could not be completely done by Color Oops. I regret trying this product every time my hair gets damp. For me, the barely noticeable results are not worth the trouble and the lingering stink.onditioner, my hair looked a little fried but not too bad.

    <li> Ok so I googled and youtubed until I was like screw it, im going to do this! I ordered it and the night i got in mail i used. I gota say THIS WORKS SO GOOD!! AND smells soo bad! BUT, for what it did i can deal with the smell for a while if need be. My black box dye ive been doing for years, is GONE!! now im at a reddish brown and am debating on what the next step is.&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!! GET IT!!</li>
    <li> Works well, but be careful about leaving it on too long.  It left my hair porous and a little brittle, but I was applying new dye &amp; keratin afterward anyway to seal the shaft back.  I&#x27;ve been using 30 level processor with my dye, so my hair wasn&#x27;t my regular color underneath all the dye.  If you&#x27;re not planning on putting new dye on after using this stuff, ABSOLUTELY do a strand test.  My hair was orange after I washed this out.</li>
    <li> I was originally strawberry blonde and made the mistake of going brunette for Halloween. I couldn&#x27;t fade the color on my own so I tried to dye lighter. Didn&#x27;t work. This product did just the trick!! I&#x27;m now back to my original color!</li>
    <li> I just used this on my hair about 20 minutes ago, to get rid of some brown hair dye I had used on previously hennaed hair. I have been using henna on my hair for about two years, but two months ago wanted to go back to my natural brunette color. I ended up hating it - the color was fine, but because of the henna, washed out easily. I was having to redye it every three weeks or so, and it was starting to affect the health of my hair. I used Clairol Perfect 10 Dark Brown dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only was the box dye affecting my ends (I had to have an inch of broken ends cut off), but I came to realize that I simply love being a redhead, so wished to go back to henna, which is far healthier than box dyes. I bought the Color Oops to remove the brown dye so that I could apply henna again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does work on hennaed hair, but not to remove the henna. The directions indicate that you should not use this product on hennaed hair. That is true only in the sense that this will not remove the henna. If you hennaed your hair and don&#x27;t like it, sorry, you&#x27;re stuck. It will have to grow out. I was concerned that my hair would turn an odd shade because of the henna, but that did not happen. The henna is still present in my hair except for the top two inches or so, as I had not used more henna in the last couple of months. I will be re-hennaeing my hair when I finish this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of my hair, perhaps 10 or 12 inches, is the beautiful red color I always got with henna - perhaps a little brighter, in fact. The top two inches of roots are an odd, bronze-yellow color, because the brown dye is gone but there is no henna. I will assume that upon re-hennaeing my hair, the roots will be a brighter shade than the rest of my hair. I&#x27;m not really worried about that; for one thing, I&#x27;d like brighter highlights in my hair, and for another, I wear my hair up at work so most people aren&#x27;t likely to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is safe to use if you hennaed your hair BEFORE you dyed it another color. It will simply not get rid of the henna, it will only eliminate the boxed dye. I followed the directions closely and definitely rinsed my hair for a solid 20 minutes - do NOT skimp on this. I shampooed three times and used conditioner twice. I have not noticed any breakage - in fact, my hair feels very soft. That said, my hair is quite healthy. If you have dyed your hair to the breaking point, you will likely not have the same result. I wouldn&#x27;t use Color Oops twice unless I had to, though, for my hair&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of you have used henna in the past and are concerned about a strange reaction, don&#x27;t be. I have not noticed one. If you want to eliminate henna by using this, it will not work - unless what you used was not real henna, which is possible if you are not careful about the source of your henna. True henna will not be affected by this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> This stuff works so well! Heres the story: My hair is naturally a medium brown but I dyed it pitch black a few months ago. Looked like a stupid wig at first but softened a little bit after I washed it. I liked it for a little while then decided to get hot red highlights. Black with red highlights, sounds hot right? NO! Long story short- it looked like a really cheap dye job. So..... I read all the reviews about this product and it sounded pretty promising so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It took ALL the red and black out. My hair is still slightly darker than my roots but its so close, nobody can tell.      It says right on the box but just incase anyone doesnt know- this stuff doesnt work if you have lightened your hair. The salon had to bleach the streaks in my hair before they put the red dye in it so now I have blonde highlights. Oh! and I was freaking out about how bad the smell was going to be in my one room apartment. But it actually wasnt too bad. The at home hair dying kits smell SO MUCH worse!! The bathroom kinda smelled like crap for a little while....but its a bathroom. Thats what its for, right? And the consistency of the dye remover could definitely be worse. Think about it as having a squeeze bottle full of water...thats pretty much what it was like.     This was all a few weeks ago. I waited a while before posting a review because I was really paranoid about the black coming back like some other reviews had said. But......nope! Im so happy my hair is back!!!! This product is the best thing ever invented.</li>
    <li> Got this when my daughter said she wanted her dark blond hair to be brunette (it became a lovely chestnut color), then 2 days later she wanted it darker (it became a very dark brunette).  Then changed her mind again and wanted it all out, so with a tearful adolescent in tow, I got this right before the drugstore closed.  It was amazing: ALL the dye seemed to wash out, leaving her hair an appealing strawberry blond, lighter than her natural color.  But now ALL THE COLOR IS BACK! It doesn&#x27;t look like we used ANYTHING AT ALL.  \\&quot;Can that happen?\\&quot; I asked myself, but I see from other reviews that it can and does.  Truly weird, and a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Do not buy! Did absolutely nothing to my hair except make it smell and feel weird.</li>
    <li> Have thick, shoulder length naturally dirty blonde hair that I have been dying a level 3 (darkest brown) for 3+ years.  Knew there was no way that this would remove ALL of the color, but thought if I could get myself a few shades lighter, then I could redye to a lighter brown. (think medium brown, level 5).  Followed directions to a T the first time, but felt like I didnt have enough product to saturate my hair completely.  It lifted my roots to nearly my natural color, but the ends really only went up to a dark brown.  I filled with a protein filler, and then redyed with a level 5.  Sure enough my hair went right back to brown/black and I was back where I started.  Decided to give it a second go, ordering 2 boxes this time.  Followed directions to a T again (RINSE RINSE RINSE)...but My roots actually turned RED this time, and again my ends barely lifted, maybe to a dark 4?  Again I used a protein filler, let air dry, and re dyed immediately.  I couldnt walk around with those hot roots...no ma&#x27;am!  I tried again to use the level 5 medium borwn, but my ends went straight back to almost black and my roots to dark brown.  I think I&#x27;ll just shell out the money to have this done proffessionally.  I actually think this product would work for someone who literally JUST dyed their hair and wants to remove, but for soemone like me who has been depositing color in it for so long, an at home remedy is just not going to do the trick.</li>
    <li> After reading TONS of reviews on this product and a few more like it with no bleach.....  I went with two boxes of this.  I have naturally very dark hair, with a yet unknown amount of gray.  After 13 years of coloring my hair every three weeks, I decided I was going to go natural.  I talked to two different hair dressers who WOULD NOT DO IT for me!!!!  Not sure if they knew what was going to happen for sure, or just had a conflict of interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, this takes the color out of your hair, no doubt. But you will end up NOT your original color. Do not be deceived by other reviews, or optimistic.  Many of the warnings inside the product (not on the outside of the box mind you)  say that you will not get back your natural color, particularly if you have dark hair.  What I have learned is that even if you dye dark hair dark, as I had done to cover gray. The dark DYE actually uses peroxide to lighten your hair first and then deposits the color molecules on your hair and the developer &#x27;expands&#x27; them to stay in your hair shaft. That is how they &#x27;know&#x27; what color your hair will be when done, otherwise it would be a little different for everyone depending on your original hair color, right?  SO, if you had dark hair going into ANY other color, it will be coppery when you remove all that color. FOR SURE. (I&#x27;ll try and find the right after photos and add to this).  If you have gray or light colored hair, you will also end up with some off color, but it will depend more on what color you had colored it and I cannot speak to that...  my grays are just a lighter shade of the copper than my darks are apparently.  It will take a couple months for it to grow out and know for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, if you are &#x27;going natural&#x27; to salt and pepper after coloring your hair dark for many years my advice to you is this.  Let it grow out as much as you can stand it after you stop coloring before you do ANYTHING.  I had longer than shoulder length hair...  and I now have very short hair except for on top, and that is going shorter before I&amp;#34;m done!!  Remember, it will grow back.. but I could not stand the idea of just suddenly having salt and pepper roots with dark brown everything else and let that grow out that way. SO, this will lighten it and give you and in between stage. OR you can have the salon do highlights to start blending it in as you transition.  THERE IS NO GRACEFUL, QUICK, one step solution to this objective.  This worked out OK for me, people just thought I was doing another odd color job, I have varied between auburn and dark brown over the years, but ALWAYS colored before my roots would be obvious...  Now in the back, all the colored hair is cut off and the shaved/taper neck is mostly dark brown and the longer stuff looks copper, it is 60% the dyed shaft in length and 40% grown out.  At my next cut in a couple weeks it would be at least 75% natural with just the ends being coppery on the top half of my head and might look like that style they have now where you color the ends a different color!!  who knows, but it is a good transition for me! GOOD LUCK TO YOU if this is what you are trying to accomplish! I think 3 months of patience is the only real solution!except for on top, and that is going shorter before I&amp;#34;m done!!

    <li> Epic failure. I followed the directions but could barely see a difference in the color. In my opinion, it is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I tried color oops after dying my hair black. The black was a BIG mistake and color oops worked great. Only needed one box. It&#x27;s my &#x27;go to&amp;#34; anytime my hair doesn&#x27;t come out just right. Some might need two treatments but I would recommend to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product exactly how the directions said and it still didn&#x27;t get any color out of my hair! While using this the smell was so bad me and my sister were both gagging to the point where we felt like we were going to vomit and it made the whole process EXTREMELY difficult. After rinsing and washing my hair literally for hours I could not get the smell to fade whatsoever. I was even so desperate to get rid of the stench I sprayed straight perfume into my hair till it was damp and it still smelled like rotten food. I ended up washing my hair over 15 times in the next two days. THIS WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY EVER! DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU WANT TO SMELL LIKE ROTTEN EGGS!!!!!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen my real hair color in years.  It totally worked without doing damage.  Thanks, Oops people. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I wanted to attempt to remove red permanent color from my hair. I want to note that I am not a hairdresser. Additionally, before I continue, there are a couple things to note about red dye and hair color removers in general:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Red dye has the smallest pigments and is therefore the hardest to remove.&lt;br /&gt;2. All hair color removers, no matter the brand, typically leave your hair a brassy goldish-orange color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you get in this kit resembles what you&#x27;d get in boxed hair dye. You&#x27;ll get an applicator bottle with developer in it and a bottle of the remover. You mix them and then apply it just like you would boxed dye. Word of warning though, it&#x27;s very watery so it will drip if you&#x27;re not careful. I applied a clear plastic shower cap while I waited just so I wouldn&#x27;t accidentally get it on any clothes or furniture. It&#x27;s not necessay but if you get it on fabric it does seem to leave a mark similar to that of a bleached spot on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to wait the full 20 minutes until rinsing. In fact, the instructions recommend checking on it every couple minutes to see if you&#x27;ve reached your desired results yet. I left it in the full 20 minutes. Next - rinsing. All in all you&#x27;re going to be rinsing for at least 20-30 minutes. You may think this is excessive but it&#x27;s the most important part. Don&#x27;t try to cut corners here. Additionally, make sure you get a REALLY good conditioner to use on your hair. No matter what these hair color remover boxes tell you, they are all rough on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I followed all the instructions. The end result? As expected it left my hair a brassy orange-blonde color. The instructions state that you can dye your hair immediately - don&#x27;t. Your hair will tend to darken for the first 24 hours or so. I consulted a couple friends who were hairdressers on how best to get back to a medium brown taking into account the brassiness. this is SO IMPORTANT - DO NOT PURCHASE A COLOR WITH ANY AMOUNT OF WARMTH IN IT. NONE. Both my friends recommended staying around a 6. So I bought a 6A which is a light ash brown. Coloring my hair was somewhat painful at this point (lots of chemicals on my scalp recently). Additionally, because of the remover it processed more quickly. My final result was a nice medium brown. There&#x27;s still some brassiness to it, but the ash color masked most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with my results and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Okay so I dyed my hair almost jet black about six weeks ago, and about three days ago I used color oops and I am thrilled with the results! It took the color out of my hair with some damage, but that is expected so PLEASE deep condition your hair after use! Make sure you follow the directions in the box to a T! Rinse your hair very thoroughly, you don&#x27;t want the results to revere because you didn&#x27;t wash your hair out enough! But besides the rotten egg smell and the few days of brittle hair, I am SO happy with the results!</li>
    <li> My hair was red and its hard to dye other colors on top of it. I wanted to dye it purple. Color oops when applied to red hair turns your hair purple tint which worked out perfect for when I applied purple hair dye :) I also got to see my natural hair color that was pretty awesome haven&#x27;t seen it in years.</li>
    <li> My hair was originally chocolate brown and I dyed it black a while back, now my hair ends right below my collar bone and is between thick and thin. I had dyed it black in June and it&#x27;s now January and I wanted a new color. I had heard of Color Oops and was really excited but also nervous. I did my research on how it worked and what it did to black hair, it was supposed to turn it like a brassy color and COMPLETELY remove the hair dye. I spent the money on the extra strength thinking it would work better...but no, it barely worked at all. I followed every single instruction to the T and even read  the ENTIRE little booklet with the warnings, tips, and general information. I was in the shower for 45 minutes (I timed it) rinsing and shampooing and my hair is now half black and half very very dark brown that it barely looks different! This was a huuuuuuge waste of money and  time, not to mention the horrid stench the stuff gave off...now my hair smells like rotten eggs.</li>
    <li> I have to it works really good I tried it and my hair was back to its natural hair color. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone. Yes it does stink but it works to remove dye hair I love it.</li>
    <li> Pros: easy to use, removes color successfully, inexpensive (in comparison to going to a salon), does not damage hair hardly at all.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: smells like sulfur and fruit, slight difficulty breathing when applying the product (fumes?), unpredictable end results, although I got lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is truly fantastic and does it&#x27;s job if you follow the instructions, yet the end color truly is all luck. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;Natural hair color: Dark dark chocolate brown&lt;br /&gt;End hair color: light auburn chestnut brown&lt;br /&gt;Most recent dye: Black, although I tried to dye it a light brown a day ago.&lt;br /&gt;Type of hair: 3-4 inches past my shoulder, thick and coarse.&lt;br /&gt;For the past year and a half I&#x27;ve dyed my hair burgundy brownish, then bright ariel red, then black.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my hair dyed black for the past 3 months. One application lasted a long time, although the roots were starting to grow in and it looked strange, so silly me I thought I could just dye it brown. So I bought a light golden brown and applied it on my hair. Of course, my virgin roots came out that nice golden light brown color, but the rest of my hair was black, with maybe a tiny brown tint. My hair looked like a mess. So I purchased two boxes of color oops and did as it instructed. I thoroughly covered my hair, then pinned it up and put it in a shower cap for 20 minutes. I then shampooed and washed it for 20-25 minutes shampooing it 4 times. I put a moisturizing damage repairing conditioner on my hair and put a cap over it and left the conditioner on for ten minutes before rinsing out. I then blow dryed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Result: A light auburn chestnut brown all throughout my hair. I&#x27;m pretty sure because I used a lot of developer on my hair to lighten it (from when I dyed it ariel red) my natural hair color could never be achieved, I lightened it away. However, what I was left with was very very beautiful! I love this color, it was almost exactly what I was going to dye it after using this product, but decided not to when I saw these nice results! Now, because of these sort of unpredictable color results I would recommend anyone buy hair color prior to using this product because you may get a color you do not like....&lt;br /&gt;Now, one last thing, as far as the smell goes, ya it&#x27;s bad, but if you&#x27;re used to using semi-permanent dyes on your hair than having slightly off smelling hair for a couple days is no new experience, so I didn&#x27;t really mind.</li>
    <li> So after spending too much at the salon to keep dyeing my hair I made the wrong decision to dye it myself!!  I was having my hair professionally dyed a light brown color with caramel and lighter highlights.  It just got to be too much money.  I purchased a box dye from Wal-Mart, made sure I got the lightest neutral brown color.  Well, it came out WAY TOO DARK!!!  Looked terrible, I&#x27;m almost 50 and I really don&#x27;t need my hair color to help me look even older!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I dealt with it for awhile, thinking I was stuck for good with it.  Then I decided to do some research online and came across Color Oops!  I was really scared to try and it took me a month to finally do it.  I bought the extra strength, and also bought 2 different types of hair masks with deep, deep conditioning and proteins in them.  My hair is somewhat thick and longer than shoulder length so I used 2 boxes of the Color Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, the Color Oops does have a very stinky smell.  It also takes a whole lot of rinsing time.  I also shampooed 2 more times than the instructions said to.  Then I left in the conditioning mask for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally happy with the results.  It certainly did get rid of that awful drab dark color!!!  I am left with light brown hair with some subtle coppery highlights.  So worth all the stinky smell, rinsing, and conditioning.  I would do it again in a heartbeat if I had to.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t use this product sooner!!!  I haven&#x27;t even tried to recolor my hair yet and if I was left with the current color I would be happy.  Unfortunately, I am going to have to cover my gray at some point.  I say give this product a try, especially if you&#x27;re suffering with a color that is too dark.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best color remover on the market. Loreal and all the others put peroxide in their removers, leaving you with weird orange tints and hair that feels dry and crispy. Color Oops lets you lift as much color as possible without peroxide (no damage, way less weird orange tint) and if once you&#x27;ve used it&#x27;s still not as light as you would like, your hair is bleach-ready right away, but YOU get to choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair at home often, and I keep 1-3 boxes of Color Oops in my bathroom at all times. I would never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely rinse for as long as the directions say - maybe a little longer. Use mutliple rounds of shampoo and conditioner - this is the most important part.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 14 year old girl writing a review of the product with my mother&#x27;s acount.&lt;br /&gt;To start off with the history of my hair color, I want to say that this product DOES get unnatural colors out of hair, even though it says it doesn&#x27;t! When my hair-coloring journey began, I got Manic Panic Voodoo Blue hair dye. Since I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair forever until I cut it off, I decided not to bleach it. My hair is a medium blonde, about a shade of 7 or so. I dyed my hair and it turned out a turquoise blue which I loved, but wasn&#x27;t the color of the bottle. When it faded, it faded into green because of my natural yellow pigment.&lt;br /&gt;So I then redyed more of that same blue over the green, but it color-blended to a shade of dark blue-green. About after 3 months, the dark blue-green faded to green, and I didn&#x27;t like it, plus I wanted to dye it purple. I started looking into products that get hair dye out of hair without bleaching. Most of the products were for people who had gone from blonde to a dark color that didn&#x27;t turn out well, and for your whole head, but I just needed something that gets unnatural colors out of the ends of hair, and the green wasn&#x27;t a ton darker than my natural shade.&lt;br /&gt;First, I started with crushed Vitamin C tablets and dandruff shampoo, several times. Didn&#x27;t do anything. Then I tried baking soda and dandruff shampoo. Didn&#x27;t do anything. Then I heard about Color Zap, but the reviews said it damaged hair, so that was a no-go.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found a product called Color Oops, and the situation turned from seemingly hopeless to entirely possible. So I bought it, but then I read a label on the side: DOES NOT WORK ON UNNATURAL COLORS, LIKE BLUES, GREENS, ETC. OR GOING FROM LIGHT HAIR TO DARK. My heart sank, but I though to try it anyway because, hey, what if it worked?&lt;br /&gt;I comb my hair well, and apply it. Now, I&#x27;ve read reviews that say the smell absolutely sucks, but that&#x27;s not entirely true, at least in my case. When I first put it on, it almost smelled a bit like citrus, but then after letting it sit, it did smell kinda gross and like rotten eggs. When I washed it off, the green had gone away dramatically! IT WAS AMAZING AND I WAS SOO HAPPY!!&lt;br /&gt;So, I rinsed it out and it looked soooo much better, but there was still green left. I wanted it all out, so I waited for my hair to dry and repeated the process. That second time, the green was pretty much gone, accept for a light tint because my hair is permanently stained now, since it&#x27;s such a light color. But the green was finally gone!&lt;br /&gt;After much rejoicing, and a lot of conditioner, I waited for my hair to dry for about 4 or 5 hours. Then I dyed my hair Manic Panic Ultra Violet Purple, and the little green tint didn&#x27;t effect the color. It turned out beautiful! So now my hair is an amazing shade of purple that I didn&#x27;t need bleach for, and my hair isn&#x27;t damaged.&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it wasn&#x27;t that big of a problem. Yes, it smelled bad, but only when I put the hair against my nose did I actually smell it.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all of you during your hair journey!</li>
    <li> I read over 50 reviews before using this product tonight. I am 54, I have been dying my hair since I was 30. For the past 20 yrs, my color has been medium to dark mahagony brown. At the beginning my roots would be my reddish brown hair, then I started noticing some gray roots.  Now the roots are completely white and I had to dye my roots every 3 weeks when that terrible line between white and dark brown made it look as if my hair was thin and or non existent at the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Well, tonight I used Color Oops and I am so happy with the results. My ends went from dark brown to dark blonde, mid way down the hair it&#x27;s a med. blonde and my roots are still white.  Even with the white roots, you don&#x27;t see any \\&quot;line\\&quot;. This is what I wanted to accomplish, I don&#x27;t want to have to dye my obvious roots every 3 weeks.  Tomorrow I will be dying the roots Champagne blonde.&lt;br /&gt;The process was practically effortless. Yes, it smells odd. Worse than regular hair dye and not as bad as bleach.  Yes, it was not a creme or mouse, it is a liquide and you have to saturate you hair, put on the cap and roll a towel up and wrap it around the cap to catch any dripping.  20 minutes on 20 minutes in the shower doing all the rinsing and shampooing.  I cannot believe it actually removed the dark brown.  Once around 12 yrs ago I went to a salon and tried to have them remove the color so I could go lighter, they used bleach, it turned out brassy and orangy and they had a hard time coloring over that.&lt;br /&gt;Most of the negative things I read are about people tryig to fix a black hair dye. Some say the color comes back to the hair in a few days.  I guess I have to wait to see if that happens.  Tomorrow, I will avoid the middle and ends and just dye the white roots.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this for women who&#x27;s roots have gone from their natural color to white and they don&#x27;t want to continue having a dark dye color because the roots come in so fast.</li>
    <li> well I just brought this yesterday and I have black dyed hair originally my hair is brown but yeah. THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME.</li>
    <li> they really should provide a mask for this product, it was the worse thing I ever smelt. It even left a bad taste in my mouth just from inhaling it. it didn&#x27;t work as well as expected, left me with a orange blonde color. but if you plan on trying it I suggest you purchase a mask!! and don&#x27;t use around children because it is breath taking.</li>
    <li> so basically, i dyed the ends of my hair blue about 5 months ago. By now, it has turned an ugly green color that id rather not have. I saw color oops and thought. Hey! my hair will be perfectly blonde on the ends again. I lathered the product on and even blow dried it to speed up the process. I waited 30 minutes with the cap and when i took my hair out it was still the same green as before. so i went in the shower, washed it 3 times. still the same green, and now my hair smells of rotten eggs and rotten fruit. If you have blue/green hair, don&#x27;t use this to get the color out. Huge waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;It has been the next day. I went to sleep with foul smelling hair, woke up this morning and washed it another 2 times, this time leaving the shampoo to soak for 5 min each time. added deep conditioner and my hair. It still smells exactly the same, and looks exactly the same. To make the matters worse, my whole bathroom smells of sulfur. I tried putting on some face lotion that i had in the bathroom to find that the lotion smells of sulfur. all the plastics in my bathroom smell, as well as my deodorant. will edit more tomorrow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair dark for at least 12 years. Its been every color; black, the blue black. every shade of brown. &amp; every shade of red. A few months ago I wanted to go bright red, it literally looked like blood when I was washing it out. A week later I decided I don&#x27;t like my hair red. I picked out a dark brown which I liked a lot. But the dark brown would not stay, it kept fading a reddish tint. So I kept dying it the dark brown. So about3 weeks ago I decided to change things up and put a blond chunk on the left side. I got some bleach....turned a little orange but I liked it. A few days ago I wanted to go all blond underneath. Of course it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. I remember seeing Oops Color in the store and did some research on it and figured I would just give it a try. My hair was bleach/blond/orange underneath and dark brown on top. I did the Oops Color...also bought a box of black just in case. When i was done washing it out and got to drying it. It was a very pretty honey brown I would say, with very light blond underneath. I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work but I actually like it and think I&#x27;m going to keep it for a while. I&#x27;m so happy I found this and won&#x27;t have to use gross bleach that kills my hair. Yes it stinks, but its sulfur.</li>
    <li> I had colored my gray hair and it was a natural shade of medium ash blonde, but it seemed too dark to be natural to go with my fair complexion.  It was once naturally blonde. I did not want to strip my hair, as I didn&#x27;t want to wind up with cotton candy hair.  So, I went and got this color remover.  It is a pain having to rinse your hair so long, and while I was standing there I also shampooed it twice, and after 20 minutes I let it go another couple minutes, then toweled it off and put conditioner on it and then rinsed that off.  Well, my hair did look like it had been stripped, and it was orange.  Sigh.  I went to bed, hoping that it would darken during the night.  It didn&#x27;t.  So I redid the hair with lighter ash blonde, and this time I got it right.  Slightly more like cotton candy than I wanted, but still I was glad I had used it.  I liked the lighter shade of ash blonde I wound up with, and the product did exactly what it said it would do.  I can recommend this product if you feel your hair is colored too darkly, and you want to start over.  It smells bad but you&#x27;ll get over it, it is not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Been a natural girl for a little over a year...I like to experiment with various colors,  made the mistake of dying my hair black but this stripped it ALL out. THE SMELL IS OUT OF THIS WORLD... but it does what it says, after rinsing my hair was a pretty chestnut brown which I easily dyed red with a rinse right after. Didn&#x27;t change my curl pattern of my 3c hair</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of mixed reviews about this product and finally bit the bullet and tried it today. It worked great! It didn&#x27;t smell as bad as I had read it would, and the color was lifted to a bright copper color. It didn&#x27;t feel like straw when I was done(as some reviews said it would), and I colored right after. It looks great! I would still recommend doing a deep conditioning treatment though-that&#x27;s a big shock you&#x27;re putting your hair through all at once. I&#x27;m probably going to do coconut oil or a L&#x27;Oreal conditioning mask I have at home. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
    <li> I have done a lot of research on this product before I bought it, but NO ONE said anything about whether or not if it would work on Bigen Powder permanent hair color. So I had to find out for myself. I dyed my hair black brown with Bigen, just one time. It is not henna by the way, it is all chemicals and has a very high level of PPD. Bigen is made in Japan and they don&#x27;t have to abide by the FDA&#x27;s safety limits for PPD, of no more than 6%, so it has 12.3%! That may be why Color Oops cant get it out, and Bigen has ingredients equal to Ammonia and peroxide when mixed with water. When I used Bigen I didn&#x27;t know how bad it is for your health, anyway I cant seem to get this stuff out of my hair. I looked at the reviews of Color Oops extra strength, and watched the YouTube videos, and every one had such good results. It smells nice to me, and was very thin and drippy like others have said. But I put it on just the black part of hair, which is about four inches from my scalp, I covered it and waited a little over the 20 minutes. Then rinsed, and shampooed, and rinsed again for as long as it said. I heard that it was drying on the hair, so I used, Organix Brazilian keratin therapy Shampoo. My hair didn&#x27;t feel dry, but it did feel a little like wires, until I used Organix Brazilian keratin therapy Conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;But the color? Didn&#x27;t touch it. It does not work on Bigen dyed hair for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 8 years now, so much so that I really don&#x27;t remember what my natural hair color is. Recently I dyed it a very dark chocolate brown, which turned out to be way to dark for my liking. I followed the instructions exactly and I must say I was very pleased with the results. Yes, my hair came out orange, carrot orange. Some spots were more yellowish than others, but overall I was orange. So it worked. The instructions do say though that it won&#x27;t work on colors such as green and blue etc. Since I dyed my hair purple once I&#x27;ve been stuck with this reddish glow and it actually did come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would have actually written on the outside of the box that if you are going to dye your hair after this to pick a shade lighter than you wanted. I chose a light golden brown and after I finished the color ops process and redyed it, it came out a medium to darkish brown again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I liked it, kind of did the job, but not as well as I expected.</li>
    <li> Horrible. My hair is the same color and it made not only my hair but my house smell awful too. Would not recommend. Waste of money and time.</li>
    <li> I came back two years later to say I still love this product. After going back to blond, I went back to red again for my wedding, remembered how much work it was and decided to go blonde again. This time around I probably should have done two treatments to get back to my natural color, but the one got most of the color out and didn&#x27;t leave me with a terrible color so I decided to give my hair a break. See my original review below and added pictures of the difference in color :) (P.S. this product still smells, but that goes away!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I usually don&#x27;t review products (which is bad because I always rely heavily on reading reviews before I purchase anything) but I had to for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here&#x27;s my color backstory: I&#x27;ve been dying my hair dark red (and I mean RED) with Ion Color Brilliance, L&#x27;Oreal HiColor, and various boxed dyes at least once a month (sometimes twice because red is a pain in the butt to maintain) for over two years now. I&#x27;ve also had a professional dye my hair twice. My hair is naturally a light-medium blonde with plenty of highlights. Back in January I decided I wanted to go back to blonde and took my head to a high-end professional because I didn&#x27;t want to fry my hair since I know how hard it is to get red out. The stylist told me I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get my hair back to it&#x27;s natural color on that visit as it would be too damaging on my hair. I had told her to take the process as slow as necessary to keep my hair as healthy as possible and that I&#x27;d come back for multiple treatments, if needed. I didn&#x27;t care that it would be darker than my desired shade, I just wanted to begin the process of removing the red. We decided to go the route of highlighting my hair back to blonde (as it would be the least damaging to all my strands). I ended up being at the salon for 9 hours, five of which I spent with 40 volume bleach on half of my hair. I assumed this wasn&#x27;t a concern, as the stylist kept returning to check on my hair and saying &amp;#34;just a little longer, it&#x27;s not the color I want it, yet.&amp;#34; Once she was finished and began washing the bleach from my hair I could just FEEL how damaged it was. She was completely unable to run her hands through my hair until she conditioned it 4 times...and even then it was rough. Once I returned to the chair I saw my hair. Half of it was platinum blonde and half of it was orange. It was awful. I pride myself on having beautiful, long hair and the ends were just fried. She had tried to cut them off before I noticed, but it was too late. She ended up needing to remove about 3 inches of my hair and what was left was still severely damaged. My hair was falling out and breaking for weeks no matter how much care and treatments I gave it. It cost me hundreds of dollars to damage my hair (almost)beyond repair. She also ruined the shirt I was wearing by getting bleach all over it. After I deemed my hair healthy enough to redye it I decided to go back to red and just live with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Color Oops Experience: This past weekend I decided I really wanted to go back to blonde, my hair was still pretty damaged from the salon experience and having to dye it red so often wasn&#x27;t helping anything. I found Color Oops online and began reading reviews. It seemed worth a shot (my hair was ruined, anyway) so I decided to buy some and see what happened. I also had my deep conditioner and some smoothing serum, just in case. The entire process, from the start of application to the finished product took about 2 hours. I have medium-thick hair that goes about 4 inches below the shoulders and I only used one bottle, but I had to stretch it at the end. I did a test strip for the first time in my life and determined I should leave it on for the full 20 minutes. After playing with the test strand a bit once it was dry and determining my hair was no worse for wear, I gathered up the courage to put it all over my head. After my 20 minutes were up I jumped in the shower and shampooedand rinsed my hair for the recommended 20 minutes (and was a little worried to not notice any color running out), shampooed again and rinsed for 10. My hair felt a little rough so I applied my deep conditioner all over my head twice, then did an extra time on the ends (my hair was pretty damaged from the start, so those with healthier hair probably won&#x27;t need to do that). After I was satisfied with the feel of my hair I got out of the shower, towel blotted my hair and applied the smoothing serum. I let my hair air dry overnight and when I woke up I looked in the mirror and...my hair was blonde, and it wasn&#x27;t any more damaged than before. In fact, it seemed more shiny and healthy than I&#x27;d seen it in over a year (I always apply deep conditioner and a smoothing serum after coloring my hair to try and curb the damage, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d like it to). Now, my hair isn&#x27;t COMPLETELY back to it&#x27;s natural color, it&#x27;s more of a strawberry blonde, but it&#x27;s definitely blonde, which is impressive coming from dark red. Color Oops does say if you are trying to get rid of more than one layer of color you will have to do multiple applications. You can do it right away or you can wait, as I am.  Either way, I give this product 5 stars. It removed RED from my blonde hair without noticeable damage and without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Do a test strand. It will help you determine how long to leave the product on your hair and how it will handle it, as well.&lt;br /&gt;2. Wear a shirt you don&#x27;t care about if you&#x27;re as clumsy with dye as I am. It&#x27;s got a very slick consistency and I was getting droplets everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;3. Have some nice smelling hair product to put on afterward. The smell is awful, but it fades quickly after the first few hours and it&#x27;s totally worth it. If you have some product to mask the smell (as I did) use it. You won&#x27;t be able to smell your hair unless it&#x27;s up against your face.&lt;br /&gt;4. Make sure to have a back up (whether it be another box of Color Oops or some hair dye) around, just in case the color you end up with isn&#x27;t attractive. If you&#x27;re going to add color back into your hair make sure to have a protein filler, as well. Your hair will darken QUICKLY. I didn&#x27;t need either, but some people might. I recommend a second box of Color Oops, but it&#x27;s whatever feels right to you.&lt;br /&gt;5. Be patient while rinsing your hair. It takes a long time, but the more you rinse, the better your results. I was in the shower for an hour rinsing and conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;6. Have a deep conditioner ready.

    <li> It worked. I did exactly as it said. I left it on the full time, I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed.  I put a very good quality conditioner in my hair and waited until the next evening to recolor.  I am quite pleased.  I had dark brown hair that was taking too much color at the ends.  When I re-dyed I used a very light shade of brown.  I didn&#x27;t leave it on for more than 5 minutes.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the best gray coverage when recoloring but I am going to try to frost it to make up for that.  All in all, Color Oops did what it was supposed to do.  It removed the old color and left me with a fresh slate.  Regaring the smell.  I guess most people here have never had an old fashioned hair permanent which always smelled that way and you could NOT wash it out and had to live with that smell for a few days.</li>
    <li> Oops didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, but I&#x27;m dealing with 10+ years of dye over henna over dye, so I wasn&#x27;t actually expecting miracles! I am hoping a second application will pull more. What I DID want to say is that the smell isn&#x27;t nearly as awful as so many other reviews had led me to believe. It wasn&#x27;t too strong going on and once I rinsed (and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed!) it out, it was just a very faint sulfur-y smell. Not great, but like I said, not horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I conditioned as usual and felt no ill effects. Probably for people with more normal dye issues it would work better  ;-)  Going back to lemon juice and vitamin C which has worked miracles (okay, lightened it about 2 shades, but given my hair, that&#x27;s a miracle!)  I love my henna, but it&#x27;s gotten very dark over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would most definitely recommend Oops to a friend who had a dye mishap or was just sick of their color and wanted a change.</li>
    <li> Works awesome, I am a natural blonde I died my hair black, it removed the black dye so I could redye my hair red! If you are trying to lift your hair from black dyed to blonde you may need to do more then one application, and if your hair is longer than your shoulders or thick you should use at least 2 boxes.</li>
    <li> Barely took out the dark brown semi-permanent hair color I had... Now it&#x27;s just a lighter dark brown. For me, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Try the new box by the makers of color oops, its called \\&quot;color prep\\&quot; This product is a miracle in a box!!! I couldnt find it on amazon so i bought at walgreens. So i figd i would leave a review here for the new box (i like the regular too) Unlike most products that make claims that seem too good to be true, this stuff will not let its consumer down...I&#x27;m telling you ladies, my hair is way over processed and I was sooo nervous  about putting any other chemicals on my waist length hair, my next move was going to be chopping it coz I absolutely hated my latest color foul. But I took a chance, I saw this stuff while looking for the regular color oops, this was $2 less than the regular kind and i must say it is much better!! Its foams as you rub into the hair has the consistency of a shampoo and allows it to work well into the hair shaft.  Aside from an unpleasant odor tthis stuff is A-mazing!! Did no further damage to my hair whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Saved me! I don&#x27;t usually color my own hair, but I got in a &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; this past Saturday and decided to dye my normally golden brown hair what I thought would be a hint of red. Nope. My hair was almost PURPLE. I died. I was out of town on vacation so going to my hairstylist wasn&#x27;t going to happen. I decided to try Color Oops. The pharmacy only had the Extra Strength, which I understand is really for older colorings and the regular strength is for newer colorings (within 48 hrs) ~ anyhoo I had no choice in the matter since they only carried the extra strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! I cannot express this enough. After the initial 20 minutes, I stepped in the shower and my hair rinsed clear, so I thought ok, cool. I&#x27;m done. I did not shampoo the first go round. NOPE! I got out of the shower after rinsing for about ten minutes and thought I was ok. I looked in the mirror and my hair was blonde. Whoops. Thankfully, I went on Amazon and read the reviews and suggestions. I put my conditioner in the refrigerator and hopped back in the shower. I shampooed and rinsed and shampooed and rinsed until I was pruny. But you have to do this! It is essential. Then I slathered on the chilled conditioner and let it sit for 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who says this stuff doesn&#x27;t work most likely did not follow the directions and did not have the patience to do it right. I posted pics below, but I wasn&#x27;t thinking about posting on Amazon when I took them, so they don&#x27;t really do the results justice. Didn&#x27;t take close ups of my hair before and after, but take my word for it, my hair was almost purple in the first pic! I have not recolored yet either - FYI. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product ONLY works if you JUST dyed your hair and want to revert it back to what it was before. In that case, it sort of works. But that&#x27;s only if you had your natural hair before and applied a hair color recently. This DOES NOT work on dyed hair that has been dyed more than once (2 different colors in the past 2 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But mostly I hate this product so much because the smell alone makes it not worth it. It is the WORST, most RANCID disgusting smell. It smells like rotten eggs and it&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE to get rid of the smell. I washed my hair about 6 times yesterday and today with shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; a hair treatment (all good ones), and still the rancid smell is overpowering. My pillow smells like it so I had trouble sleeping. I&#x27;m not normally someone who cares about the smell of products - I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for years and not much bothers me in general. But this smell made me nauseous and WON&#x27;T GO AWAY. I would recommend not buying this product for that alone, but there&#x27;s also other reasons why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It barely took to my hair and now I just have foul-smelling hair. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair dark for years from a dish water blonde but every time I washed my hair I would watch my investment being washed down the drain. I started doing it myself and was using Naturtint from Whole Foods. Great color and went on even but washed out on the first wash and then started to fade unevenly.  So I went to Sally&#x27;s and they gave me an Ion hair remover. I had to do it twice. It left me a orangey red. I then decided to go a bright strawberry blonde. It turned out almost black with a red hue to it. NOTHING like the color swatch. The color was all wrong for my skin tone so when I came across Color Opps on the Internet I decided to give it a try.  I applied the Opps and within no time I could see the color changing. My bang area was starting to turn yellow  and looking way lighter then the rest of the hair. I rinsed as directed, applied a protein conditioner, sat for 1 hour and rinsed again. Over the next 20-30 minutes the hair color evened out and the bangs matched the rest of the hair. The color I have now is exactly as the color swatch. How is this possible! As I read other testimonials they seem to have similar experiences. I have no idea how to touch up the roots but will cross that bridge later. Needless to say I like the color and am very pleased I decided to do the Opps. My hair was not that dry considering all the processing. Nice to know there&#x27;s a life saver out there that saves me especially from spending a fortune on color repair at the salon.</li>
    <li> I used 2 boxes of this product on my long hair and it barely took the color out of the roots. I was left with 3 tone hair. Not impressed at all! I am now going to the salon to turn back blonde.</li>
    <li> I had dyed my hair a blue/black, my natural hair color was a golden brown. After the tedious process of using color oops, I saw no change whatsoever in the hair color. Maybe it worked for some, just not for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It got all the red hair dye out of my hair. Although the process is tedious it is very worth it, and it does smell but it&#x27;s not as bad a people make it out to seem.</li>
    <li> In only 3-4 minutes, removed the worst $170 dye job ever experienced in the history of mankind. What a brave and glorious world where $10 worth of Color Oops can undo the world&#x27;s most disgusting greenish-blackish-something in the time it takes to walk to the mailbox.</li>
    <li> So, my hair has been several different colors over the course of a year or so. My hair is healthy and it was dyed a dark red-brown shade. Nice color, but I had blonde Hilights underneath along with my natural color and I decided to go back to that. I did my research. Countless youtube videos as well as a lot of other online reviews and tips. I went to walmart and got a box, and went home and promptly applied it and waiting the full 20 minutes because I had a couple layers of hair dye already in my hair. I rinsed. And rinsed. And rinsed. Through the course of the rinsing (about 25 minutes in total), I shampooed about 7 times (with a cheap shampoo with lots of detergents to help better break down the color), and then conditioned.  I got out of the shower, wiped the mirror, and looked up in horror as I had carrot-orange hair. After calling my mom and having her make an emergency run to walmart to get a box of light brown hair dye (I used Clairol Natural Instincts in 11g, Light Golden Brown...an ammonia and bleach free semi-permanent dye that conditions and deposits color without lightening the color underneath). I dyed my hair, and it turned out well. The color is perfectly even. Back to my natural color, which is what I was going for. I don&#x27;t blame the color oops for my hair turning orange, because it was just an old permanent box dye that lightened my natural color.&lt;br /&gt;  In hindsight, I don&#x27;t regret anything because I&#x27;m back to my natural color even though I had to take an extra step to get there. Just remember to condition, and use an ammonia free dye (Demi permanent if your mixing your own color...just don&#x27;t go above a 3% (10 volume) peroxide). My hair is perfectly healthy, and still looks and feels great. I would typically use a professional Demi permanent dye, but since my mom knows nothing about hair, I just had her get the most gentle and effective box dye possible.&lt;br /&gt;  Hope my review helped. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I had been going back and forth between blonde and black hair for years.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I decided to let my natural grow out and be done with it all! However, when I decided this I was stuck with black hair that I could not get out. I was going to just let my roots grow out, but as a natural ashy blonde it looked very unflattering as it continued to grow. I bought color oops on a whim and decided to give it a try. After rinsing for 45 minutes, the results were better than expected! Since I had bleached my hair in the past and died it black on top of that, there was no way I could ever get my natural back- however Color Oops turned the bleached/black section of my hair to a nice golden brown, and the part of my hair that had only been touched by black turned back to my natural and left a lovely red tint! So now my hair has an interesting and nearly professional ombré look. Maybe it was an accident, but I&#x27;m thrilled with my own personal results!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet but hear it&#x27;s fine</li>
    <li> I used this brand to correct a home dye job gone bad. This was the first time I had a home dye job go bad. The color was a combination of too dark in places and bright red, orange, and purple in others. I used this product the day after and it toned down my hair perfectly leaving it a much softer lighter color - and more bearable! AND it left my gray roots colored which is why I dyed my hair in the first place. It did require about 30 minutes of shampooing and rinsing but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I applied a &#x27;richer&#x27; tone to my medium auburn hair and ended up with what my gentleman friend described as \\&quot;an abyss of darkness.\\&quot;  Not a terrible color in itself, but awful with my skin tone.  I tried Color Oops, and yes it&#x27;s drippy, stinks, and all the rinsing will drain your water heater and test the limits of your rich inner life, but it undoubtedly works.  It removed the dark color and, on my hair, did not make it a weird color.  It was simply back the way it was - color-wise anyway.  The condition of my hair, between the coloring and Color Oops, was dry, brittle, and breaking.  I&#x27;ve been using a protein treatment and deep conditioners and snipped the ends, so it&#x27;s on the mend, and despite the damage, I still feel it was worth removing the color.  So, this works but you may not come out unscathed.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair smelling like rotten eggs for atleast 3 months I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product. I used this product to get a red semi-permanent color out of my hair thinking it would work perfectly. It did lighten my hair but it took it from a dark red to a light red which looked even more terrible. The application was the worst part. It&#x27;s a liquidy milky substance that fills the air with rotten eggs. I couldn&#x27;t help but cry because the stench was that terrible. Stupidly I applied it in my house which soon filled the entire house with a sulfur stench. This product was almost like a nightmare.. The night I used it there was a power outage in my city so I could not use a fan or anything else to get the smell out of my house. For days on end it reeked. To solve my problem I had to go to the salon and apply a darker brown over my hair color which I did not want, but it was my only solution to get rid of his horrid color and smell of my hair. Even after the salon visit my hair still smelled like eggs. I would walk into a place with people and immediately they would gasp and ask why it smelled like eggs. So if you were to use this product I would recommend you do it outside and also only do it if you truly hate yourself.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews here then ran to walmart to purchase it. Walmart is slightly cheaper.. 9.99 a bottle. First, my hair is thick and bra strap length. I had dark brown hair and I used a Loreal ombr&amp;eacute; (red) on the bottom 1/2 of my hair which was a total disaster which is what lead me to use this product. Make sure you follow all instructions and cautions on the instruction pamphlet. You will want to purchase gloves in addition because the gloves that come with it tore on both hands for me. Luckily I had additional gloves. I purchased two oops because of my length and thickness. I also purchased a hair color for recolor purposes (Loreal  7 1/2 A medium ash brown). Oops has a very strong odor - to me it smells like a new perm odor. You will want to work quickly. If you have medium to long length hair you will want to make sure you follow the instruction to comb through your hair with a wide tooth comb before applying the shower cap. This is important because you want to make sure every inch of your hair has absorbed the product. I purchased two thinking one wouldn&#x27;t cover all my hair. But it did. I waited the full 20 minutes then got in the shower. You will want to do this because the rinse is the most important part. I washed and conditioned my hair with Loreal total extreme repair 5. If you have a good conditioner great but if not you will want to purchase one to avoid damaging your hair with this product. I washed and conditioned twice after rinsing out oops. I let my hair air dry and awaited the results. As I had feared the top half was red (previously dark brown) and lower 1/2 was blonde (previously red). So for me I was glad I purchased two Oops. Second box following same instructions resulted in more even blonde throughout. Slightly more blonde on the bottom 1/2. I again waited for it to dry then recolored. As with other warnings in the reviews DO NOT leave on the full time. Your hair has been stripped so it picks up the new color quickly! I took approx 2 minutes to apply then left on for an additional 2 minutes. Checked a strip and it was time to rinse! End result is a ash brown with a few blonde strips which looks great because it looks like highlights. Hair damage-- NONE! My hair is soft and looks great -- but smells like a new perm.. Only downside.s to apply then left on for an additional 2 minutes. Checked a strip and it was time to rinse!

    <li> My daughter had dyed her hair Voodoo Blue by Manic Panic and then made the mistake of going to the water park.  The chlorine stripped most of the color out and left it an ugly green.  We decided to give this a try and it worked wonders!! Although it has kind of a funky smell, it took every bit of the green color out of her hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been so indecisive lately about my color. I&#x27;m a natural blonde, and I decided to go brown again. It turned out WAY darker than I wanted. The July 1st pic was before I colored it, July 2nd was the color. July 3rd was me doing the Dawn dish Soap, Vitamin C pills crushed and the head and shoulders method and the July 6th was right after I used the Color Oops. It worked WONDERS! Very impressed. I actually haven&#x27;t done any color to it yet either!</li>
    <li> Bought Color Oops to get rid of a color that was too dark for me. I was definitely nervous since I&#x27;ve read some nightmare reviews. It was really quick, easy, and turned out great. My hair did feel pretty dry after, but nothing extremely damaging (my hair is thin and fragile so I was expecting much worse). When I first saw it, my hair looked a little orange and much lighter than expected. Once it dried, the color looked better, so don&#x27;t panic.  The smell wasn&#x27;t great, nothing as bad as some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read. My bathroom smells like a perm, but hopefully it&#x27;ll go away within a few days. I posted pictures from before and after!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  I have been coloring my hair for nearly 20 years and have tried many shades of red and brown.  All of my color has been done at home and nearly all of it has been permanent.  Recently wanted to go red again, so bought a semi-permanent hair color to use.  Bright red at the roots and dark red/purple/brown over the old coloring.  It looked awful.  After reading reviews I thought this was worth a shot since corrective coloring at the salon would run me $70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions very closely, including shampooing 5-6 times during the 20 minute rinsing process.  I was worried my hair would look or feel more damaged, but it feels the same as before I colored it, after I applied a heavy conditioning cream at the end.  Very happy with the results and the HUGE savings when compared to the salon.</li>
    <li> After keeping my hair black for nearly two years I wanted out. This stuff does the trick. It will realistically make your hair a bit brassy but you can dye the same day you use color opps.The worst thing is the smell. Its smells like an boiled egg sulfar salad. It took 4 days to come out. After rinsing close to 27 times per shower, twice a day, for 4 days.</li>
    <li> Does not get rid of hair that is lighter then your hair color. It might work if you had lighten hair and dyed it dark, but not the other way around.</li>
    <li> Does a REALLY GOOD job stripping the red out of blonde hair. For the past two winters, I have dyed my very light, golden blonde hair a deep shade of red. One application of this is enough to mostly strip all the red out, leaving me with a more or less yellow-y blonde left. The yellow-blonde is kind of highlighter-eqsue, so I stopped by CVS to grab a shade of dirty blonde to put over, and I was super happy with the results. From previous experience, if you use two applications, this generally does a better job getting all the color out, though I still have to put a dark blonde dye over it, which washes out soon enough, leaving you with a nice blonde, almost a hint of red. Took about 3 months after applying this to fully get my normal shade of blonde back, which is very impressive considering how much red sticks to blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for hair bleached by Alfaparf in red on virgin black hair that was then covered by Special Effect Blood Red, washed out, and then dyed a chocolate brown. Lots of colors were mixed in and this took it back to a dark ash blonde color that was a result of the Alfaparf bleaching process (this dye works by lightening dark hair while adding the red so you do not need to pre-bleach it first.) Happy with the results! Did not damage hair at all, but does warn you that it leaves hair very porous. If you&#x27;re going to dye it right away, only leave it in for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I have not yet dyed my hair and it&#x27;s been about three days now. Added a deep conditioner and the smell went away in about a day or two. The smell isn&#x27;t strong, but does smell a bit like old tuna fish. Would suggest keeping your bathroom fan on and door open. I also used Febreeze in my bathroom afterwards and lit a candle. Would also suggest washing your hair the next day if you do not dye it right away to get any additional smells out. It did stink up my pillow cases that night.</li>
    <li> Hahahahah. Misunderstood what was going to happen. Turned my hair blonde. It definitely removed the red though. Lololol.</li>
    <li> I had really REALLY stubborn cherry red in my hair that I have let fade out in he last three months. But there were several spots that would not fade out! I did a bleach bath on those spots and roots followed by bleach session on the whole head and the lighter area to get the same color value. But the red would STILL be there! So today I used this and took a very long shower to rinse it out. I used a deep conditioner after 15-20min of rinsing- And it&#x27;s gone! I couldn&#x27;t be happier! (:</li>
    <li> My stylist gave me lowlights that came in very dark.  I lived with the them a few days and then decided I could not wait for fading (they were semi-permanent, applied to previously all-over dyed hair) as I felt embarrassed by them and didn&#x27;t think I could go to work looking quite so Goth.  I found Color Oops, read a bunch of reviews, and decided to give it a try.  I followed the directions, including the 20 minutes of rinsing, and ended up with a brassy blonde shade that was even, suggesting that C.O. had removed both the new and old dye.  My natural color is a light ash brown with some gray.  To kill the brass and restore normalcy I bought a protein color filler, some Wella blonde toner and 20 developer, and a good conditioner.  I used the protein color filler and then immediately mixed and applied the toner.  At about 10 minutes, my hair had achieved its light brown, so I rinsed and conditioned.  When I dried my hair, it was a nice variegated light brown, a little warmer than my natural color but fine.  Lessons:  Toner is a good idea to adjust for brassiness after removing the bad dye;  toner, like regular dye, will be absorbed quickly after using Color Oops.  My hair after this whole process is shiny and healthy-looking.  I am grateful for this product and pleased that I could get a nice result from just a toner afterward.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. It is extremely drying though. I recommend a deep conditioning treatment afterwards. I applied this to bright magenta/red hair and was expecting to be left with a bright orange mop, but actually it wasn&#x27;t as bad I thought. The end result was a very gold color. I dried my hair and went to bed, not even attempting to color for 24 hours. I am happy to say that the following day I was able to achieve a light brown with one attempt and no red tints. I definitely recommend this to anyone removing red especially.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair for about ten years. Naturally, I am between the darkest shade of blonde and the lightest shade of brown. I have been dying my hair a medium red-brown for about ten years. I decided I wanted to get to strawberry blonde, and after reading many reviews I felt confident about trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the Color Oops EXACTLY as instructed, including the 30 minute rinse in warm/hot water. My hair was extremely dry from this process, but I decided to go ahead and do the Protein Filler, as instructed, and then dyed my hair with Garnier Nutrisse Shade 100, which is something like &amp;#34;Lightest Natural Blonde&amp;#34; because Color Oops said to pick a shade much lighter than you really want. I left it on for 5 minutes, as instructed by Color Oops and the result was yellow/gold blonde roots and the rest of my hair was a light red-brown color with a little tint of orange (not in a bad way!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, my hair (except for my roots!) Is back to exactly where I started before Color Oops: medium red-brown. I am very disappointed as I watched soo many videos and took advice from everyone and this product didnt end up doing anything in the end. I wonder if people reviewed this immediately after drying their hair, and also infact went back to their original color two days later like I did?</li>
    <li> This was a life saver.  My daughter has had every color of the rainbow.  She decided she wanted to go to a teal color so we started with a soap cap (powdered bleach, developer and shampoo) to remove the purple she had in and lighten the roots.  When we rinsed she was left with a bunch of red that was not lifted by the bleach.  We figured we&#x27;d try this because bleaching again would be more damaging) We followed the directions but when the time was up it didn&#x27;t look like it did anything.  So we washed and rinsed her hair for 20-30 minutes (get a cheap shampoo because you&#x27;ll use alot)and when we were through the red was completely gone.  The only cons I can think of is the smell and the texture it leaves the hair.  Coconut oil will help with conditioning.</li>
    <li> I followed directions which were a pain.  Old color jobs from months ago were left after the treatment.  Terrible, difficult to use product.</li>
    <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  After reading all the reviews on here I thought I would give it a try.  My hair is normally light brown and I dyed it dark brown almost black.  I put this on 3 times in 2 days and it didn&#x27;t lighten it at all. And yes,  I followed the directions.</li>
    <li> I have gone from my natural medium brown with red highlights to black for years. I&#x27;ve wanted to go back but everything I tried failed. This DID work to a degree but it is not a straightforward process.firstly it would be nice if they STATE blatantly on the box: THICK AND LONG HAIR MAY REQUIRE TWO BOXES. This made for a last minute run back to the store as I was ready to apply this. On areas that had less exposure to the color, roots for example, the hair literally turns color showing it is working. The problem is that it is also a very lengthy process to do it right, they tell you to stand under warm/hot water for 20-25 minutes-that is hard. I did it all right-my hair is two tone now-the more built up areas of color will need minimally one more treatment but honestly I think it will have to grow out-even salons tell you it is a long hard process.</li>
    <li> Its good remove my black hair safely but it dried my ends a bit but it does work would purchase again</li>
    <li> For some silly reason I decided to go black. Wow did I look ridiculous. I thought I was stuck with it but then learned you can strip it out. This product was awesome. It took me right back to normal brown.</li>
    <li> I have highlights and wanted to cover them so I bought a medium golden brown to use on my dark brown hair.  My hair ended up looking inky with red undertones.  I hated it.  I saw this in CVS and decided to give it a try.  The product REALLY stinks and the rinsing part is labor intensive, but it is all worth it.  My hair came out exactly the way it looked before I dyed it.  I still have my highlights.  Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> if I could give it zero stars I would...this doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I used color oops to remove an uneven dark burgundy from my hair, and I was suprised at how well it worked. Instead of an orange color, color oops left a soft golden blonde, with no damage at all too my hair. The only downside was the smell, but it was barely noticeable with a few open windows.</li>
    <li> Took some really old black hair dye off! This is like magic.</li>
    <li> This is a detailed review because I think I have finally figured out the best way to use this, with a few additional steps that are not in the instructions. They make a very big difference. I have used this on myself and others with great results and have been coloring hair for 30 years. I really hope this helps others. These sulfur-based color removers are great but there are some things you need to know. If you are clear on what to expect from Oops and follow a few additional steps, Oops can be a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a quick description of my starting hair color &amp; condition, this last time around: Long, thick, very processed hair, bleached completely in the past two months, color removed previously, bleached again, then various colors put on by a colorist at a salon, from blonde to red, all with bad results. In the end I was left with the front of my hair looking ashy green/silver and the back looking red/pink. Disaster. Horribly uneven and wrong in every way. I figured I would fix it myself and start all over. I rarely see professionals for color and I regret doing so now; I get better results on my own as long as I&#x27;m careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things that make a huge difference in achieving great results with Oops (especially if you have several layers of dye on your hair, or a very dark dye): 1) a heating cap, and 2) a \\&quot;bleach wash\\&quot; at the end, also known as a \\&quot;soap cap.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the whole process, you will need the following:&lt;br /&gt;-2 boxes of Oops (3 or 4 if you have tons of hair)&lt;br /&gt;-1 or 2 packets lightening bleach powder (from beauty supply store)&lt;br /&gt;-1 small bottle 10 volume developer (from beauty supply store)&lt;br /&gt;-clarifying (anti-residue) shampoo or dandruff shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-a small non-metallic bowl and mixing utensil (it&#x27;s essential that these not be metal)&lt;br /&gt;-a heating cap (sold on this site and some beauty supply stores)&lt;br /&gt;-several processing caps (basically just sheer shower caps like they give you in hotels)&lt;br /&gt;-re-usable latex gloves or several pairs of disposable&lt;br /&gt;-Neutral Protein Filler (beauty supply store)&lt;br /&gt;-spray bottle (optional)&lt;br /&gt;-Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar (optional)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix up the Oops per directions. Put vaseline around your hairline because it can burn. Use the gloves they give you, and wear something that protects your upper back and shoulders. Put Oops all over your dry hair, working it in well. Then put on the processing cap (the Oops package comes with one.) Put a heating cap over this. This makes a HUGE difference to results on difficult or heavily dyed hair. It is also a great thing to have for using with deep conditioning treatments. I have the Thermal Spa Professional Conditioning Heat Cap from this site and my hair can&#x27;t live without it! It will open the cuticle shaft and allow for deeper penetration; for me, this made all the difference in results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While you are mixing up the Oops, plug in the heat cap on High, to pre-heat. Once you have the Oops and processing/shower cap on, reduce the heating cap to level 2 (Medium) and put it on your head, over the shower cap. Wait 20 minutes. Unlike what some reviewers say, leaving the product longer will NOT help: it has a short life once it is mixed and will just stop working after 20 minutes. Then rinse like crazy. Yes, you need to rinse for 15 minutes. Set a timer in the bathroom. Do it. Shampoo with clarifying shampoo and rinse for another few minutes. Do NOT condition afterwards!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, many of us need to do a second application of Oops. If your hair now looks orange (dark, medium, or light), which it almost certainly will, do a second application --- as long as you hair is not breaking off, which it should not be. Just mix up the second Oops box. No one has more processed hair than I do, and it was fine. You can do the second application on damp, towel-tried hair. Do not worry. It&#x27;s better than baking in the new color with your dryer. Put the Oops on again, with processing cap, and sit with your heat cap on one more time for 15-20 minutes. This time rinse for about 10 minutes. That will be enough. Depending on the color of your starting hair dye, result will be some shade of orange or yellow. This is normal and the best Oops or any sulfur-based remover can do. This is the whole idea, so be happy with it --- Oops will not turn your hair back to your original color. It can&#x27;t. The developers in hair dye lift molecules out of your hair so you won&#x27;t get the exact original color back. And needless to say it can&#x27;t lift out bleach if you bleached your hair previously. The idea of Oops is to either get you to a color you like enough to keep, or prepare for a new dye job by taking out old color pigment. The orange is NOT brassiness (like you can get from warm-toned hair dye), so don&#x27;t think for a second that you should put on an ash-toned color. More on that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the interesting part. After doing your Oops treatment, some people say to put on a developer (10 volume) to activate any remaining color pigment after you&#x27;re done rinsing. I did that once, and sure enough, my hair got darker. Darker orange, that is. When this happens you have to keep using more color remover, which you are not going to feel like doing after all that rinsing. Believe me. After much trial and error, I&#x27;ve found the perfect final step. For me and my friends who have used it, it is brilliant. INSTEAD of using a developer, do a &#x27;bleach wash&#x27;, also known as a &#x27;soap cap.&#x27; This does the trick for me EVERY time. This last time was no exception. Here is how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get our your non-metallic mixing bowl and utensil. Mix up 1 oz of powder bleach lightener with two ounces 10 volume developer (20 volume if your hair is dark and not too damaged). For medium to light orange hair, or fragile hair, 10 is more than adequate. When this is mixed, add about  2-3 ounces clarifying or dandruff shampoo. Mix it all up well. Put on gloves! Massage this mixture into your DAMP hair. Add a little water and keep lathering until your hair is saturated. Throw a shower/processing cap on again but this time do NOT use heat. Check your hair every 5 minutes. Rinse out when you see a satisfactory color, or hair that is light enough that you don&#x27;t want to go lighter or cause breakage. You will be able to tell. Don&#x27;t let it sit longer than 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleach wash can work miracles: on me it gets rid of the ugly ashy, yellow, AND orange tones left over from both old dye molecules and the Oops. It also spares you from reactivating the color left in your hair all the time with a developer, and having to use remover over and over and over. The bleach wash gently strips and takes out the remaining dye molecules for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the bleach wash would lighten me to the point where I could recolor, but I did not have to color over it at all. The bleach wash was all that was needed to neutralize the weird tones, and leave me with medium blonde hair with the old bleached highlights showing through nicely. No ash. No orange. Everything is even!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: After you rinse out your bleach wash, don&#x27;t condition just yet. You want to first check the color in the mirror to make sure you can live with it and do not plan to dye your hair right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About re-coloring after Oops and a bleach wash:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to re-dye your hair right away, do not condition just now; instead, mix 1 part Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar with 2 parts water, pour over your hair, then rinse that out after a minute. This restores the hair&#x27;s PH balance, which will be seriously disrupted by the Oops. Follow the vinegar rinse with a neutral protein filler. This is essential if you plan to re-color your hair, and the Oops package even tells you so. You can buy Neutral Protein Filler online or at a beauty supply. The best way to apply the protein filler is with a spray bottle. Be generous with it. After letting the filler sit on your hair for 20 minutes, blot excess, then go ahead and color right over it. Do NOT rinse the filler out and do NOT dry your hair. Just color over it, damp and with the filler on it. However, for the love of God do a strand test with whatever color you plan to use. After all this corrective work, you don&#x27;t want to mess up. Do not use an ash-based color. It will be a disaster: dark green/purple/silver. Try a gold and go up 2 levels! If you want a level 7 blonde get a level 9 dye. If you want medium neutral blonde go with light or very light golden blonde. Just do a strand test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were originally blonde and you are light orange after your Oops and bleach wash, or are &#x27;almost&#x27; back to your blonde, and you think a toner will fix that and bring it to blonde, all I can say is: DON&#x27;T. Do NOT use a toner like Wella Color Charm toners that start with the letter T (T14, T10, T28 etc.). Your hair is now so porous due to the Oops and bleach wash that it will suck up the toner and turn dark dark grey or greenish/purple.  All these toners that are meant for use on bleached hair are based on blue or violet or green, and are meant to \\&quot;ash\\&quot; up the color. That&#x27;s because a normal bleach job will bring out orange/brassy tones. These are NOT the same kinds of orange/brassy tones created by color removers and a bleach wash!!! Post-bleach toners will look so dark and ugly after color remover. Trust me: I&#x27;ve done it. Then you are back to square one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are happy with the bleach wash result and will not be coloring right away, then do a Bragg&#x27;s rinse as described above, followed by a protein reconstructor (you can use the Neutral Protein Filler diluted with water: 1 part Protein Filler, 2 parts distilled water) or Joico K-Pak Reconstructor, and let that sit 15 minutes, preferably under your heating cap. Rinse that out and do a deep moisturizing mask. Don&#x27;t do an oil treatment since that requires another round of shampoo to wash out, and you want a break from shampoo right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use more protein after this for a week. It can make fragile hair really brittle if used more often. That means avoiding hair products with Keratin or anything else that is protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This whole Oops/bleach wash process can take half a day but it is worth it to do it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize to those who did not need this amount of detail.cap on again but this time do NOT use heat.

    <li> Didnt do SxxT. Just took out the really dark color and left the Ginger color from the brown color before it. Save your money Shave your head.</li>
    <li> I am tremendously impressed with this product. I was blonde and my hair dresser experiememted with some red and the result was pink hair. Horrible and it cost me 100$! I went home and panicked and added a semi permanent. Ugly. Then I went magenta from Sallys and loved it but only lasted a few washes then turned an ugly mud brown. After that I went to have my color corrected again and another expensive disaster. I went black a month ago and hated it! I just want my blonde hair back. Well I bought 2 boxes. Did them back to back, then did a bleach wash with 10 vol developer, left that I&#x27;m for 5 minutes, washed that out added protein filler from Sallys and waited 20 min then added the color. I&#x27;m like a copper blonde now. Not my ideal color but better than everything else. I&#x27;m amazed how well this stripped the black! This was a life saver! Try it!</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve just wasted $15. After following the instructions on the box, I did a test clump, and got good results, going back to my days before I wanted to be a redhead like &amp;#34;Annie.&amp;#34; However, after almost an hour in the shower by doing the multiple rinses (I could tell stepping out of the shower that I was still red, so per the instructions, I did more shampooing and rinses). I used all of my hot water tank&#x27;s hot water, something I&#x27;ve never done before, even when eight females were getting ready. So, I&#x27;m out the $15 for the box kit, and for my water bill. Not to mention a lingering eau de stink.</li>
    <li> My hair used to be medium brown with gold highlights, no gray. Two summers ago I bleached it and made it red, then got bored and dyed it back to brown. Last summer, I bleached again, dyed it red, then, again, got bored and dyed it back to brown. This summer I decided to forgo the bleach/red/brown situation, and went for a rich, dark brown instead. The rich dark brown turned my hair black :(  This was four days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought Color Oops extra strength as it has no bleach or ammonia. Left it on for 20 minutes per instructions. Before rinsing out, my hair was a hideous combo of brilliant orange splotches and black. Instructions say to shampoo/rinse for 20 minutes, then shampoo again, and rinse for another 5 minutes. I&#x27;m impatient. I  shampooed/rinsed for 10 minutes, then shampooed/rinsed for another 5 minutes, then conditioned the hell out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orange splotches disappeared. My hair was initially a uniform light brown, which darkened to a medium brown with red/gold highlights over the next few hours. The black is GONE. I love the color; I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions after rinsing, as my hair would (probably) have stayed a light brown, and I would have had to redye afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the drawback, and the reason for three instead of five stars: Color Oops really, really damaged my hair. As I said, I&#x27;ve bleached twice in the past. Neither of the bleaches damaged my hair as much as Color Oops did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my hair color. I do not love the present texture of my hair :(</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU ARE GETTING RID OF FUNKY HAIR COLORS. It states only on the box itself that it will not work for any blue, pinks, purples or greens. Well it would be nice if it was stated before I purchased the item. Now I cannot return the other box I purchase, since I used one to try it out anyways. Blue hair&#x3D;no go. Save yourself the trouble. It smells bad as well... tough luck huh</li>
    <li> Well first it worked as supposed to - it did clear my hair off any artificial dye and I am back to my natural (or close to natural) blonde shade. It did not smell THAT bad as some people say (or maybe I am not that sensitive but my washroom is tiny and not ventilated and I was applying it with doors closed) and it left my hair without visible damaged (off course I won&#x27;t say that it does not damage hair at all). I was not expecting at all that it will completely take back time and all the staff that I tortured my hair with. Overall I have what I wanted and I am pleased with the results :)</li>
    <li> After dyeing my hair red for a year and a half, I decided that I wanted to go back to my natural darkish blonde color. I decided to give Color Oops a try, even though a lot of people said it wouldn&#x27;t work if you&#x27;d been dyeing your hair for a while. Over the course of the 1.5 years I&#x27;d been dying my hair, I used many different colors of Feria hair dye, from dark red to auburn to a dark brown in an attempt to cover up the remaining red. This process is a bit smelly, but my hair didn&#x27;t stink after I followed the rinsing and shampooing process. It takes quite a while, but if you make sure to follow the instructions exactly, you should be fine. Even though my hair was a bit longer than shoulder length and pretty thick, one box was enough. My hair turned out extremely close to my natural hair color, and even now (A little over 3 months after I used Color Oops in June), my hair has no noticeable growth line. Make sure you condition your hair after this process so it doesn&#x27;t dry out. Also, it will not work if you had dyed your hair lighter, because it cannot reverse the affects of bleach.</li>
    <li> Took some of color out, not all</li>
    <li> It works all right.  Don&#x27;t expect it to be as effective as bleach, but it works better if it&#x27;s used sooner after you have put dye in your hair rather than later.</li>
    <li> It works fairly well, but just use bleach for dyed black hair.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic and well worth the 12 dollars and 40 minutes it takes from application to final rinse!  Background: I have medium brown hair and I like my natural color but sometimes I get bored and want a change.  First, my stylist colored my hair darker than it really is.  This looked great for a while -- dramatic and all -- but I got sick of it.  I wanted to go back to my natural color, but she said it would take two steps: lightening it and then dying it again (total of about 4 hours at the salon) and I started to think it wasn&#x27;t really worth how much that would cost.  Then I wondered about going red, but decided to think about it first, again because of the cost.  I ended up dying my hair myself to see if I liked red before having my stylist do it more permanently.  I used a semi-permanent medium auburn from Natural Instincts.  I liked it for two weeks and then got sick of it.  It wasn&#x27;t going to wash out for a couple of months, and I was tired of how fake it looked in the light.  All that to say, I read some reviews of Color Oops and decided to go for it.  They had it at my local Walgreens.  I followed the directions, left it in for 20 minutes, washed it out for 20 minutes, and not only did all the semi-permanent red come out but the previous dark permanent color too!  I hadn&#x27;t had medium brown hair with copper highlights (my natural color) for 6 months, and I&#x27;m loving how normal it looks on me.  As far as I can tell, this is very close to my natural color.  I am impressed at the ease of application for the product and how well it works.  I deep conditioned my hair afterwards, but my hair feels completely fine now -- not too dry, just about the same texture as before.  Great product, much cheaper than a 4 hour double correction at a stylist.  I hadn&#x27;t bleached my hair, though, so I can&#x27;t speak to how it would look right now if I&#x27;d used hair dyes that had bleached my natural color.  I probably would have had to recolor it after using Color Oops.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing to my hair but  made it smell really  bad for days and it made my hair very porous to the point where I couldn&#x27;t run a comb through it. I beg you guys please don&#x27;t spent your money you will get better results by  just bleaching your hair. By the way I have dark brown hair and Ive used bleach on my hair a few times and it never made my hair so porous and flat out gross. I did this process a month ago and my hair still feel dry and brittle for those of you guys that don&#x27;t know what it means to have porous hair I will leave the diffeniton on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Porous hair is a condition of your cuticle layer. Porous hair has a raised cuticle layer that easily absorbs water and is quick to lose moisture as well.&lt;br /&gt;That what this product does it forces the cuticle layer to open because it&#x27;s taking color out and leaving it like that. This can not be fixed but you can use fillers and moisturize the hair so that it feels better.</li>
    <li> After (over) dyeing my hair black-brown (permanent) for close to four years, I was ready for a change. Preliminary research indicated I could either grow it out and cut it off OR bleach it; neither option was at all appealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere, somehow, (I think it was when I was reading about bleach washing) I learned about Color Oops. I read a gazillion reviews and decided to give it a shot. It seemed like it would be far less damaging than bleaching and was much more time efficient than growing the black dye out. I picked it up at the devil&#x27;s department store, aka Wal-Mart, for just under ten dollars (my local Sally&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t carry this or any other product with hydrosulfite...I live in a rural suburb of Phoenix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ODOR: many reviewers and YouTube videos make mention of how this product smells. Most of those who mention the smell point out the sulfur smell which is understandable since the active ingredient in Color Oops is hydrosulfite. That being said, the smell was not nearly as bad as other reviewers led me to believe. It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell GOOD, but its not the assault on the senses that I had read/heard about. I liken the smell to a milder version of a perm. I am a nursing mother and haven&#x27;t quite gotten rid of the hypersensitive nose that comes with pregnancy, so for ME to say that the smell was tolerable goes a long way. As a precaution, my husband took my daughter out of the house and when they returned about 15min after I was finished, he said there was only a mild odor lingering throughout our two-story home (I applied it in our upstairs bathroom and rinsed in the kitchen sink downstairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSTRUCTIONS: the instructions that are included are extremely clear and very detailed. If you follow the instructions, you really can&#x27;t go wrong. About the only thing I learned from YouTube and other reviews that wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the instructions was to agitate my hair as I rinsed, but I&#x27;ll get into that more below. It is important to note that Color Oops WILL NOT WORK ON VEGETABLE DYES (i.e. Manic Panic). It ONLY works on oxidative dyes. If you didn&#x27;t pour part a into part b, it isn&#x27;t an oxidative dye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION: the formula of this product is VERY runny. In my situation, I needed to apply this to the ends of my hair first since they were the areas that were the most over-saturated with dye. I pulled my hair back into a ponytail and applied the solution to the pony first which made it a LOT easier to avoid spilling it all over myself and the floor. After allowing the ends to process for 10min, I saturated the rest of my hair to process for the remaining 10-15min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROCESSING: once I put the included cap on my head, I went outside to the warm air. The instructions are very clear to stay out of cool rooms and away from air conditioning vents/fans. Since it was a lovely 105º outside, I sat on the porch and let the heat help things along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RINSING: several other reviewers mentioned that this was the most arduous part of the process and I can&#x27;t disagree with them. While many chose to rinse the solution out in the shower (and thus running out of hot water in the process), I opted to use the kitchen sink. My faucet has a spray function and I alternated between the spray and the regular stream. I also could have used the spigot in the tub, but kneeling on the floor didn&#x27;t seem desirable at the time. This product works by opening the cuticle and breaking down the color molecules to a size that will rinse out, so keeping the cuticle open is key. The sooner the cuticle closes (i.e. by being hit with cold water), the more dye that remains in the hair. This remaining dye can and will re-oxidize over time, giving the illusion that your hair is spontaneously re-dyeing itself. To keep the cuticle open, rinse using the hottest water you can stand. Since I needed the biggest result on the ends of my hair, I was able to use water that was hotter than I would be able to useon my scalp. To \\&quot;help\\&quot; the color molecules find their way out of my hair and down the drain, I followed other recommendations to agitate my hair whilst rinsing it. I think it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULT: I could not be more pleased with the result I achieved. My natural color is dark brown and I feel that I was returned to that color. This product works by removing just the artificial dye molecules, and because I had been using deposit-only oxidizing color, my natural color wasn&#x27;t affected at all. See for yourself by looking at my uploaded photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions claim that you can re-color your hair immediately after completing the Color Oops process and I would say that my hair felt like it was ready to receive color again. I didn&#x27;t have my new color on hand to re-color right away, but if I had I wouldn&#x27;t have hesitated to jump right in. I did re-color the next day after using a protein filler and my hair is really beautiful; shiny, smooth, and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely use this product again in the future should I have the need and I plan to rave about it to anyone who will listen. The box states that it will only remove the most recent oxidative process that has been applied to hair, but I am here to tell you that it has removed YEARS of color from my hair. I did not have any areas that had been previously bleached (i,e, highlights) which is why I was successful in achieving my natural color. For someone who has/had highlights or who has previously bleached any portion of his or her hair, just know that it is impossible for the bleached areas to return to your natural color because the natural pigments have been removed.on my scalp.

    <li> I wish I knew about this stuff years ago!! I had to write my own review after reading all the others, which were very helpful and encouraged me to try this stuff. I&#x27;m naturally a dark blonde and have been highlighting my hair forever. I didn&#x27;t want to maintain highlights anymore and wanted to get closer to my natural color and asked my stylist to dye it. She used a filler and then matched my shade, but of course it turned out DARK REDDISH BROWN!!  So ugly on me and I just didn&#x27;t feel like myself. I should have known better, since this has happened before.  Anyway, I read about this stuff and figured it couldn&#x27;t get any worse.  I just used it this morning and was very careful to follow all the instructions. I didn&#x27;t do an allergy test, but I did do a strand test. It seemed to lighten it a bit but not a ton, so I decided to go for it. I removed the rugs from my bathroom because I was afraid they&#x27;d hang onto the bad smell everyone kept talking about. I shut myself in the bathroom with a small space heater, since the instructions stressed it&#x27;s important to do it in a warm place with no drafts. I had a chair, clock radio, my computer and my phone and some water, so I was all set, lol. The stuff was a little watery but easy to apply -- I did not spill any. Definitely keep the applicator tip pointed away from you after you&#x27;re done mixing/shaking it, because a little exploded out and it could have easily gone in my eyes.  Honestly, the smell was not even that bad. If you&#x27;ve ever done a home perm, I think that smell is much worse and stronger. I finished covering all my hair (I have thin, shoulder length hair and was able to cover it all easily with one bottle), waited my 20 minutes and used the time to check my email. When the time was up, I looked in the mirror and was shocked that my hair looked orange through the shower cap, but I kept my fingers crossed that would wash out. (It did). I started rinsing it and immediately shampooed using Neutrogena&#x27;s Clarifying shampoo. Then, I looked at the clock and started my 20-minute rinse. That was a LONG time. Then I shampooed one more time, and then rinsed for 5 more minutes. I towel dried my extremely dry hair and checked it. Looked a tiny bit orange but I figured I would just wait it out, because I read another reviewer who said the orange actually toned down on its own within the first 24 hours.  Then I slathered Aveda&#x27;s damage remedy conditioner on my hair and put another shower cap on and waited at least a half hour. That helped a lot. I rinsed that out and then put some damage remedy leave in conditioner on my hair to comb it out. All things considered, it combed pretty easily and I didn&#x27;t lose much hair at all. As it dried, the reddish tones seemed to go away a little bit, and now it&#x27;s totally dry and it&#x27;s actually a nice shade of dark blonde! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect and whether my highlights and several inches of regrowth would come back, but it seems like they haven&#x27;t!  It actually looks really natural and like what I was going for all along.  This product is amazing!!  I will update this again if anything changes, like if it gets darker or something, but for now I am very happy!!  Oh, and also many people mentioned that the smell lingered, but it did not linger in my hair, nor in my bathroom. After I was done, I opened the bathroom window and put a fan by the door to air it out, and it is fine!!  The smell is honestly not a big deal at all, especially if you contain it and then use a fan and open the window.  It does dry your hair out a LOT so it&#x27;s important to have a good conditioner. Aveda&#x27;s damage remedy is really expensive but it&#x27;s also the best conditioner I have ever used and totally worth it.</li>
    <li> This is awful it wouldnt even stay wet the whole time i had to keep adding water which dluted it...... Bleach does the same thing cheaper... never again will i use this.&lt;br /&gt;First time use..... Truned my hair orange&lt;br /&gt;Second time use... No change..&lt;br /&gt;Third time use ... no change and i had to keep adding water.... this is CRAP dont use this... Ive been dyeing my hair for 12 years and only had an issue a few times but i will never use this again.</li>
    <li> Oh my word this stuff rocks! I am 63 years old and wanted to just cover some gray and get rid of the reddish color throughput my med brown hair. What I ended up with was ugly pitch black (fake look) hair. Now I love dark hair asI am of Italian heritage but not what this loojed liKe. Hubby laughed and said that I looked like something off a comics page. Watched all the you tube videos4 on this product and then went for it. I did not rinse for the whole 20 minutes the first rinse, but combined both rinses into the 20. My knees could not take it. I even sipped on my coffee once in a  while. Lol. I also have psoriasis but this product didn&#x27;t bother it thank God, I was concerned about that. I have medium auburn hair now, no gray. So it did not give me bac</li>
    <li> I died my hair and did not like it so o tried to tone it with an ash color and then my once pretty blonde hair was green and grey.  I went to hair dresser, she made it worse and dried my hair out, so I did color oops, not knowing what was going to happen because I have a lot of bleach and sun bleached hair, well let me tell you, my hair turned out  great golden blonde, with no ash at all.  It did not take me to my natural light brown color, but took everything off and kept the bleached blonde.  Miracle worker!  Did not smell bad and easy to use,  will never be afraid to color again now that I have this.</li>
    <li> I bought Color Oops to remove a too dark brown home hair color. It did remove the dark color but it left my roots fiery orange. The bottom half of my head ended up a pretty nice red brown color but I made the choice to recolor due to the roots. I used a light ash brown and it toned down the brass...do follow the 5 minute recolor instructions because it darkens very very fast just like they warn on the leaflet inside.</li>
    <li> I have naturally med. brown hair w/ about 20% gray.  I have been using lush henna noir since March 2012 probably ever 2 months or so.  I used Color Oops Dec 2012 and it did not remove the darkness but it did give me my old texture back and I can see a clearer demarcation line between my roots and the henna now.  The smell reminded me of perm solution not rotten eggs and it did linger a few days.  I rinsed and shampooed using H&amp;S because it seemed like it was the strongest detergent-y thing in my linen closet.  My hair&#x27;s condition seems better, not any worse so that is why I&#x27;m giving 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try Color Oops again and do a few things different--leave it on maybe 30 minutes?  Shampoo with a different brand, rinse twice as long.</li>
    <li> I am using Color Oops as I write this review, so that I can give a thorough and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;My hair: Currently black, very dark brown, and black cherry. Mostly black, I tried lightening it with olive oil which worked on some parts and not on others, thus the dark brown in places, and the black cherry was when my roots were about half an inch out, and I thought maybe it would blend some of the black. I died my hair black about 2 months ago. Before having black hair I had dyed dark blonde hair, before that red, and my natural hair is a medium brown (though I haven&#x27;t seen it since I was 13).&lt;br /&gt;Application: Mixing color oops was easy. Both of my gloves had rips in them so I was happy I had some cleaning gloves laying around. I have shoulder length, average thickness hair, and one bottle covered my hair just fine. After it was in I combed gently through my hair to make sure it was evenly dispersed. It was kind of runny, and a little messy to apply. I stood over a towel in my bathroom and wore an old large t-shirt I don&#x27;t care about. I put on the cap and started cleaning up the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Waiting: It takes 20 minutes to develop. You can&#x27;t be in a cold room, or next to any fan or vent blowing cool or cold air. I am sitting at my dining room table with a space heater on next to me to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get too cold. Warning, this is when you will start smelling that rotten egg smell. It wasn&#x27;t too bad at first, no worse than your average hair dye smell, but over time the smell gets stronger. When you lift the cap to check your hair it will seep out and you will understand.&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly sensetive scalp, and this is not hurting, burning, or itching at all. 3 minutes from rinsing out and this is a better experience than any time dying my hair has been. Honestly, it feels warm, and kind of nice. I&#x27;ve spent the last few minutes making up a playlist because you are suppose to rinse and wash your hair for 15-20 minutes after you&#x27;re done. Here I go.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing: Pain in the butt. It is hard to rinse because it feels dry. about 12 minutes in I had to condition my hair because I thought I was killing it. I wasn&#x27;t, and I shampooed another 2 times after I conditioned it. I conditioned it with a nice, high quality conditioner at the end and left it in for 5 minutes. I don&#x27;t sense any traces of egg smell any more, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Result: My hair is a little lighter than I expected, but since all hair color has some peroxide I can understand that. There are traces of what I have referred to as &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; hair, but much less than I expected, and in a few days I should be able to dye over that no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Why aren&#x27;t I dying right away? In the directions it states that you should NOT redye your hair the same day unless you use a protein conditioner. I don&#x27;t have a protein conditioner. My hair seems to be in good shape, but I will give it a few days to make sure before I go kiling it even more.&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt a little dry before I started, and feels exactly the same now.&lt;br /&gt;So why only 4 stars instead of 5?&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Got all of the black out with few traces of muddiness.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t fry my hair as bleaching would have done.&lt;br /&gt;Was pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t take very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, but it is there, and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;There is a little muddiness on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While both cons were known going in, it does still detract from usage of Color Oops.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would recommend using it.nsing: Pain in the butt.

    <li> I tried this product on my hair because my grey was coming in thick and my hair is getting thinner and finer with the growing years.&lt;br /&gt; I actually used it twice over about a 10 day period hoping for a more complete removal of my dyed color. I had brown dye over red dye.&lt;br /&gt; Three different products. My hair is now a light blonde which looks ok but I was hoping it would remove all the color and I would be 100% grey.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this product is the sulfur smell which is pretty strong especially whenever I get my hair wet. It has been a week and the smell is still quite strong.&lt;br /&gt; I wish I knew how to neutralize this.&lt;br /&gt; I see someone else tried vinegar, olive oil, shampoo etc to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep researching to see if I can find an answer for this. Otherwise this is a wonderful product. No allergic problems even tho I am highly allergic to the dyes.&lt;br /&gt; My beautician told me to add one packet of sweet and low to the mix to neutralize the allergic response and it works.</li>
    <li> I used a &amp;#34; non- permanent&amp;#34; (which actually was!) brown gloss on my brown/white hair and got very nice blond highlights.  I love it! Until 1/4 of my hair fell out.  Then those lovely blond highlights turned pink!  I read reviews of Oops and tried the crushed vitamin-C route first, since some reviews said their hair was lighter.  Forget the vitamin-C, complete waste of time and money.  One bottle of extra strength Oops did the trick, and removed a lot of the highlights and definitely the red-pink crazy color.  I followed the directions to the letter, extreely happy with my natural hair back.  The smell isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I thought it would be, but get the cap and gloves outside to the trash ASAP.  Thanks Oops!!</li>
    <li> Well, I read all the other reviews and I thought \\&quot;I&#x27;ll take a chance\\&quot;. What the product doesnt tell you is that if you have any kind of red in your hair, just forget it. I had gotten tired of the medium red in my hair so I went to the salon and asked them to make it brown. Well, they messed up somehow because I could still see parts of the red in the strands. I thought I&#x27;d try this product to get rid of it. The red is STILL stuck in the ends (albeit a light red), there&#x27;s no brown and now I have a chestnut red crown. WTH... So now I&#x27;m two toned.</li>
    <li> So I have to say, I was very skeptical about buying this product. I was attempting to change my hair color from black to a light brown and so I tried it at home with the L&#x27;Oreal HiColor Vanilla champagne and a 30 oreor volume that I purchased from here.  It didn&#x27;t turn out so good, part of my hair was black, another kinda reddish brownish, and the other a dark brown, I decided I didn&#x27;t want to bleach it so I went ahead and read some of these reviews and decided to buy it. I am so glad I did. I just finished doing it and it looks sooooo much better. I am so happy I didn&#x27;t have to bleach my hair and I can actually go outside and not look foolish. Thanks for selling such a great product once again amazon!!! Very happy customer</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying a color stripper. I was not pleased with this product. I purchased two boxes and I feel as if I wasted $30 for nothing. I do not see the slightest change in my hair color. Oh well, I tried!</li>
    <li> I never review products unless I&#x27;m completely wowed...and I am with Color Oops. My natural hair color is strawberry blonde, but I had been coloring it with John Frieda 5r for about 8 months. When my roots started to show this time, I figured I would try to get back to my natural color as the grow-out from Frieda was really dark and bland. Followed the directions to the T and my hair is as close to my natural color as its going to get. I did buy a color filler and a strawberry blonde L&#x27;oreal permanent dye just in case it needed a boost, but I think I&#x27;ll hold off since the color is back to normal already. I think if you&#x27;re hesitant, you should at least do the strand test and see what happens. That&#x27;s what I did and I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed. Good luck!!</li>
    <li> Originally I dyed my hair blonde and used a white toner so that I could use a turquoise/green dye. I redyed my hair blue, but it came out too dark. I bought this product so that I could re-bleach and redye my hair a lighter blue. When I used Colour Oops, the hair returned to the blonde/ginger colour that was underneath it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem occurred when I realized that as my hair dried, the ends of my hair (all the hair that had originally been bleached and dyed, not my roots) had turned green. We thought if we used Colour Oops again, the green tint would come out, but we were wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However, I learned that green dye molecules are much larger than most of the other dye molecules, such as red, so the Colour Oops may simply not have been strong enough. Regardless, I would recommend this product if you are trying to remove a colour less drastic than green.</li>
    <li> I read online on a couple of forums that I could use this to get rid of henna in my hair. It says specifically in the instructions not to use it on hennaed hair but I did it anyways. I did 2 treatments and left it on for 2-3 hours each time and honestly it made next to know difference. The good news is, my hair didn&#x27;t feel super dry afterward and the treatments didn&#x27;t make my hair break off easily or anything. So that&#x27;s good. My hair still looks exactly the same so it was just kind of a waste of time for hennaed hair. So if you are looking for a solution to removing henna with this, I just wanted to say that it didn&#x27;t really work for me as the forums promised. Doesn&#x27;t mean it wouldn&#x27;t work for chemical dyed hair though. The one thing that I truly regret about doing this is the smell. It has literally been a month and my hair still smells like rotten eggs. My boyfriend is not happy with me for doing the color opps treatment because he&#x27;s had to smell rotten eggs in my hair for the past month. Now, a month later my dry hair isn&#x27;t awful smelling but when I wet it, it still fills the entire shower with that awful smell. I&#x27;ve tried to get rid of it, nothing seems to help but time. So if you have chemically dyed hair, and you don&#x27;t mind smelling like rotten eggs for a month, this product might be good for you.</li>
    <li> Good, did not get the color out as good as I thought. Did get some out.</li>
    <li> My natural color is a dull mousy brown with some graying at the temples. Usually, I color my hair with Clairol&#x27;s Nice &amp; Easy and I&#x27;ve never had any problems. This time I decided to go red with Garnier Nutrisse permament hair color but it turned out awful on me (think Raggedy Ann). I bought some Color Oops and used it about 6 hours after the initial coloring disater. It was easy and smelled a bit like a perm (sulfury), not overwhelming. The hardest part was rinsing it for 15 minutes! But it was worth it.... now my hair is even lighter than before... like a golden blonde. Some people may not be happy if their hair ended up lighter than normal, but I love it. This was a happy accident and SO much better than the awful red. Thank you Color Oops!</li>
