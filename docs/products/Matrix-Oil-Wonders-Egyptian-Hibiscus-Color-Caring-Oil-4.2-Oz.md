      <li>I actually think it works a little better on my dry hair, but it definitely adds shine and helps control my frizz and flyaways.  </li>
      <li>I usually put a little on my hands (I use more than the 1-2 drops listed on my package, and you will have to experiment a little to find the right amount for you, depending on your hair length and texture) and then rub my hands together and pat them over my hair.  </li>

I get a lot of frizz and flyaways, and it is because of the frizz and flyaways that I was interested in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very easy to spread throughout my hair.

    <li> This is the best hair oil product on the market, period.&lt;br /&gt;Very light blend, leaves my hair soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is heavenly.  Excellent product, and&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried them all.  It&#x27;s a 10, Moroccan oil, etc etc.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair soft and manageable and never greasy.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Amazing and wonderful for dry hair. Smells lovely - my husband sniffed my head and said it was yummy. I put it on after my hair dries. I take quarter size in my palm and rub it then smooth it on. It has a sprayer but I control it better using my palms and fingers - can concentrate on getting the ends more since those are the most dry areas.</li>
    <li> Great Price.  Arrived quickly and in perfect conditon.  Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is just the best EVER. I&#x27;m so excited to find I can buy it on Amazon because it disappears quickly from the salon. It&#x27;s not greasy or overly oily, and it&#x27;s hands down the best detangler I have ever used for either myself or my daughters. Both of my younger girls have super baby fine hair, one curly and one stick straight, and it works well for both. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave their hair weighed down. I have used it both after shampooing/conditioning and before blow drying as well as after drying to control frizz. It&#x27;s amazeballs and I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff!  It is the only thing that keeps my naturally curly gray hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair are product. It smells amazing and makes my hair shine and feel so soft! The product got to my house quicker than expected and was packaged very secure (always worry about ordering liquids in the mail).</li>
    <li> Love the smell. It is not greasy at all! Gives your hair a nice shine and soft touch</li>
    <li> Love this hair product.  I have fine, thin hair and it works great.  Does not feel oily or greasy and does not affect the style.  Makes you hair feel as if it has body.</li>
    <li> My stylist gave me samples but no local vendor carries this product. I find this is lighter than Moroccan oil products.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My hair is very thick and likes to get all frizzy and weird on me.  A small dime size drop of this oil goes a long way in helping to control my hair.  The true purpose is to help retain my color.  It is amazing at that also.  My hair color stays vibrant much longer. (I have colored my hair dark cherry mahogany with a great looking vibrant purple streak in it )  You should try it!</li>
    <li> Recommend to anyone who blow dries their hair!</li>
    <li> amazing product!  does not curl your hair or make it do something you don&#x27;t want it to do.  it will take the frayed/dried look away and make it seem like you have flawless hair.  only one tiny drop does wonders so this bottle will last a VERY long time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!  It is cheaper in stores locally (ULTA beauty)  but for time sakes I just ordered on here.  This product is great to just run throught the hair before styling, but my favorite way to use this product is to coat the hair pretty throughouly before bedtime, about once per week, then wash out in the morning.  My hair stays extraordinarily soft throught the week and look awesome.  I get so many compliments on how my hair looks after using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this oil after my hairdresser used it. It&#x27;s amazing. It makes my hair feel so soft and I love love love how it smells. Thank you for the reasonable price and prompt shipping. This is a must have in my hair&#x27;s daily rituals.</li>
    <li> Adds moisture and helps with frizz, love it :)</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite shampoo. This is a great product. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great product for drier and challenged hair.</li>
