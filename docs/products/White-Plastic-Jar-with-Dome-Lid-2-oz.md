<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are small but a perfect size for gifting or selling a self-made body butter or sample or hand cream.</li>
    <li> fast shipping..&lt;br /&gt;Use these small jars for my natural body products( samples ).</li>
    <li> I purchased these jars to make some cream for myself and a few family members. They are just the right size and are exactly as described. They work perfectly for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Good serviceable jars!  Thesoapmaker.net</li>
    <li> Sturdy and perfect size at a wonderful price, I will be buying more of these.  I use for homemade lotions, deodorant, they are a perfect size for most anything.</li>
    <li> Good quality and reusable.</li>
    <li> Perfect for salves and body butter! The 2oz size is perfect for my body products. The plastic is great for travel and home use and seals well for no leakage. I have ordered the 4 oz in past for larger amounts, but the 20z is what I will reorder next time.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my home made body butter</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price!</li>
    <li> While it is hard to love a white plastic jar, these met my expectation and had an inner plastic lid. This should help prevent leaking and is a nice finishing touch, though I didn&#x27;t test them. Each jar was wrapped with a small plastic bag which I reused when I put them into a small box which was cubic, 2 inches a side and fit just right.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little jar.  4 stars because it isn&#x27;t exact as how much lotion/cream the jar will hold.  Did some experimenting with it and came up with this:  jar weighs 1.1 oz. and holds 2.4 oz of cream.  Sometimes it is nice to know what we buy.  So, a heads up:  not all jar manufacturers are the same, (I&#x27;ve bought two different 1 oz jars of from different manufacturers, and they were completely different in weight and size.</li>
    <li> I make my body rubs and muscle rubs for these and they are perfect. .Great purchase and worth the price.. Thanks</li>
    <li> Use these for homemade hand lotion.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> These are very good for bulkier ointment applications.</li>
    <li> I love to make a nice face cream using organic ingredients.  I place the lotion in  these jars.  They are a convenient size for travel and gift giving. I like the domed lid which is tight fitting and pleasant looking.  The plastic jars are light weight and conveniet to use and store.</li>
    <li> I got this is the mail quickly and were perfect for home made hand cream gifts I even have some extras.</li>
    <li> Great containers but found it cheaper elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have my own little home business that i am trying to grow, so i give samples out to family and friends and these jars are what i use to do so. They are so cute and work well with a 1 inch label. I really like this product!</li>
    <li> I would have bought more had they been available at the time. The jars are just like face cream at the store come in.</li>
    <li> these were more perfect than i could have hoped. really nice thick plastic and perfectly fitting caps. they are pure white.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for packaging home made body butter for stocking stuffers. Will buy again, as this is a nice size for small gifts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before .i really like it.</li>
    <li> These are really great little containers.</li>
    <li> These are insulated jars, and they are of very fine quality. I will be purchasing more of these in the near future.</li>
    <li> I bought these to put my supplements in when I travel.  The bottles the supplements came in are often too large for me to take on the road, and I may not need a full bottle anyway, so I like to take smaller cups&#x27; worth with me.  I use white, removable artist&#x27;s tape to label the tops of the containers, so I can re-label as necessary.  These cups are well made, sturdy and don&#x27;t have the sharp edges cheap cups can have.  I recommend them...and ordered two dozen more.</li>
    <li> A couple of the jars were coming apart.&lt;br /&gt;They still work but not to give away as gift.&lt;br /&gt;Still am happy about them.</li>
    <li> Packaged nicely. Work great for my homemade coconut oil/herb salve. No leaks even when melted.</li>
    <li> They were just the right size!</li>
    <li> they were a nice package, sturdy and just right size for my body butter. I need to buy more jars.</li>
    <li> I used these for home made lotion I made for Christmas presents. Great quality - everyone commented on how professional they looked.</li>
    <li> These were Exactly what I needed to package my homemade healing salve for gift giving.  It was not clear from my reading of the product description, but they pots come with an inner lid &amp;#34;liner&amp;#34; made of the same rigid plastic.  It has a tiny tab so you can take it off easily.  You certainly would not have to use it, but it does make it look very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked for Avery printable labels for the top of the lid, but their standard sizes were either too big or much too small for the 1.5 inches of diameter. I am sure someone makes them, but I didn&#x27;t find them in time.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I used a 1 x 2 5/8 transparent mailing label on the side of the jar.  Note that there is not *quite* 1 inch of height available before the jar curves: I kept my printing away from the sides, and cut an eighth of an inch or so off the bottom of each label before removing it from the sheet.  No big deal if you&#x27;re only doing a dozen or two, but I would hate to do a real production batch that way!</li>
    <li> Great for my home made creams</li>
    <li> Perfect size and screw on top very secure. These will be used for whipped body butter. Can be washed, dried and reused.</li>
    <li> I really like these little containers. I contemplated for quite a while what size I needed, and these are perfect. I make my own toothpaste from 2 Tablespoons of coconut oil and 2 Tablespoons of soda. Then I add some peppermint oil and maybe lavendar or whatever else may be my favorite at the time. I have started using the same mixture as a scrub with the facial soap I use. It is working wonders with my skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE! The perfect size for my products! I will be ordering plenty more in the future. Oh by the way do you have 4.oz and 8.oz containers as well? Thanks a bunch.</li>
    <li> Great for homemade moisturizers. Solid little cups.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my jars, I make my own body butters and this jar gives my products a professional look, also holds product securely. Labels fasten to them nicely. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I used these containers to pack and transport spices when I was living abroad. The lids work well. Plus I used a few containers to take cosmetics for a weekend trip. Perfect size! I wish they had the same ones in 1 Oz containers.</li>
    <li> I use this when I make up my essential oil blend face creams. The size is perfect for making gifts of my moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Great Jars for a good price.</li>
    <li> Exactly the size that I needed for my homemade deodorant.  The lids fit well and there is no leakage.  I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Just as I expected.  Perfect for small amounts of hand cream.  I used some plasticoat spray paint to color them to match my decor, and now leave them in places around the house, near where I sit, to keep handy.  I wish I could have bought half an order, but I gave the rest to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love these little jars! The tops close nicely. I use them for my face cremes and homemade pain cremes, etc.</li>
    <li> I make my own Owie cream and these are perfect containers for it! I Plan on buying more.</li>
    <li> These jars are just the right size for salves and clay masks. I&#x27;ve been using them a year now, and I have no complaints. My sticker labels go on perfectly and stay on, the lids twist on and off easily, and they&#x27;re clean/ nice looking.</li>
    <li> Great jars. I use these for sample product size. No leaks, they seal great. I have use these so far for butter, hair cream, pomade, and herbs. The only thing is the price. I would try to find this size with more quantity for that price. The jar is thick and stable.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to use for my whipped body butter that I will use in gift baskets. These were perfect size and it was easy to attach my own personal labels to.</li>
    <li> good value nice product clean, well made, will definitely purchase again.  Smooth opening and shutting, no jagged edges - besides washing they need no care</li>
    <li> I loved these little jars for sugar scrub with essential oils...some did leak, but great for drier things.</li>
    <li> I read all of the questions, answers and a lot of the comments and am pleased that I got exactly what was expected. Mine did not leak at all and I would most definelty purchase this product again. Very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> Great for solids like beads or grains, so-so for creams or lotions.&lt;br /&gt;The size is good.</li>
    <li> Very nice jars.  The lids seem tight and they are the perfect size.</li>
    <li> Great jar for cosmetics, creams, or body butter! Delivery was fast as well! Will order these again!</li>
    <li> great product, quick shipping</li>
    <li> These were great for the homemade lotion I made for Christmas. They are just the right size for a gift.</li>
    <li> I recently started making lotions and body butters at home and these are perfect for that. They close securely and they are small enough to be conveniently portable and big enough to hold something for everyday use without needing too many of them. They feel pretty sturdy so I would imagine since you get so many they would be nice to give as gifts full of homemade goodies.</li>
    <li> Amazing perfect to home made lotion doesnt leak!</li>
    <li> Great for storing baby care essentials like coconut oil (for diaper cream), raw honey (for cuts and scrapes), etc, without too much bulk. No worries with spillage as the lids fits nice and snug.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the sugar scrubs I create!</li>
    <li> I purchased these to go with my 4 oz jars to use for homemade lotions. Jars arrived neatly packaged and clean. Love the round tops better than the flat tops as it gives the jar more of a professional \\&quot;spa look.\\&quot; Will purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I love the easy to open jars!</li>
    <li> , If your thinking about making your own creams and lotiond, ur best off getting plastic storage containers,,thank you .Starla</li>
    <li> These jars were the perfect size for my homemade body butters and face creams.  I only make small amounts because I&#x27;m experimenting with different fragrances.</li>
    <li> Great product for my homemade lotions !  They are just the right size for gifts. I will purchase again when these have been used.</li>

    <li> Very pleased with these jars. They are great for my facial moisturizers and also body butters. Seals well. This is my second time to buy this type jar.</li>
    <li> I use these containers for lotions and creams. They&#x27;re sturdy and easy to open and close...the threading doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Happy with the product. It came on time and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I make my own lotion and bought these...they are the perfect size and make awesome gifts for something homemade. I have them at work and people always open it to see what good is inside. I use the P-touch labels on top or on the sides to label now. I will for sure order more and more of these!</li>
    <li> Work great. Nice snug fit. Doesn&#x27;t leak my whipped Shea Butter. hold up will. labels adhered just fine.</li>
    <li> good product and price</li>
    <li> I for whatever reason had it in my mind that these would be larger. The description says 2 oz, but I must not have been paying attention. However, I still and getting use for these little jars. I like to put product in them, that is almost used to save space. For example, leave in conditioner, lotion etc. I was looking for something for my diy lotion, but these proved to be to small for what I needed. I do however, keep on with some of my diy lotion in the living room since that does not get used as often so that the product will get used before it turns. Quality is excellent, so I would purchase again if needed.</li>
    <li> This item was just exactly what we wanted for our homemade lotion/creams.  Perfect size and the cost was very affordable.</li>

    <li> Excellent! Exactly what I wanted! Great price!</li>
    <li> They work great for the lotions we have been making. Perfect size and secure closing lids. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t believe they were 2 oz container had to do the measurements will diffently order more price was great</li>
    <li> Perfect for home made balms and lotions.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for. Didnt leak even with liquid oil. Very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Great size, sturdy little jars! I used them to make my own deodorant and give them as gifts to friends and family members. Very nice!</li>
    <li> Very nice, well made, my favorite jars for my homemade health products. Google: Alien Country to see my excellent, all natural products like mens moustache wax, diaper balm, chest rub, mosquito repellent, and first aid ointment.</li>
    <li> I ordered several orders of these, because I was crafting lots of bath salts and body butters for holiday gifts. There worked out great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
    <li> I used these for facial powder and other homemade beauty products! So far they have worked wonderfully. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> ok ..... hard to get sealed properly</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. I used them for handmade lotion. Worked great.</li>
    <li> Work great with homemade salves that I made.  I would purchase again.  Nice product for any items or crafts. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good product for my homemade creams.</li>
    <li> Straightforward. They&#x27;re jars. They hold stuff. They have lids. They&#x27;re plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them for supplement powders and they work very well for this. I got them cause they&#x27;re easier and more durable than bags, and they work. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re leakproof or leak resistant as I haven&#x27;t tried liquids in them. I venture they probably are though because they seal well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy them again, especially at the price. But I&#x27;ve got a bunch so I won&#x27;t need to :P</li>
