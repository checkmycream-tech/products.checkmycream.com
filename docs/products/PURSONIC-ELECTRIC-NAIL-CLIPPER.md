### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If it was called a &amp;#34;NAIL MASSAGER&amp;#34; it would be great!  </li>
      <li>Not to impressed at all.</li>
      <li>Best thing since sliced bread for a person with a handicap, I have ALS</li>
      <li>incredibly well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t own this electric nail trimmer, but had the chance to use it --</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be the smoothest clip I&#x27;ve ever had -- but again, this would be great for someone who really needed it.</li>
      <li>but my son is able to use it with one hand.</li>
      <li>, now the thing you need to know is that it&#x27;s more of a nail nibbler.</li>
      <li>not designed properly---engineer was more concerned with safety than getting the job done</li>
      <li>This works great on my finger nails but it is not tough enough for toe nails.  </li>
      <li>It works but it&#x27;s not as powerful as it should be, because of that it takes longer to get the job done.</li>
      <li>this thing is NOT made cheaply very powerful it really works</li>
      <li>You rotate your nail back and forth, and more nails bits get removed.</li>
      <li>very quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If anyone reading this is obese, or just can&#x27;t reach your toes very well to trim them, this trimmer is not for you.  </li>
      <li>, you have to also take a few seconds to dump out the filings, then at most a couple of minutes to smooth over a couple of rough edges.</li>
      <li>Also, the nail is left with a rough edge that then needs real filing!  </li>

<li> The result is that the two hands must be held at an odd angle, very difficult for my elderly mother for whom I bought it, and very difficult for any arthritic, weaker hands.  </li>
<li> Wrong.  </li>
<li> Works slowly, but does trim nails without those nasty clippers.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t do as advertised -paper weight :(</li>
<li> Disappointing!!</li>

    <li> The biggest mistake I have ever made was to buy this piece of junk. If they sold it for ten cents it would be overpriced by fifteen. Do not buy this&lt;br /&gt;crap.</li>
    <li> I have just received my Pursonic electric nail clipper today December 5, 2014.  I have tried it and personally I would give it a zero.  This clipper has a rotary nail trimming head.  The visible moving part is a spinning cutter bar.  It is on the same order as a vacuum cleaner&#x27;s beater bar brush.  The trimming is so slow you would do a quicker job with a fingernail file.  I am obese at the present time that I write this.  Because of my extra bulk trying to trim my toenails with a manual clippers is a struggle.  Usually I stoop over to trim my toenails.  I was hoping these clippers would speed up the job.  Wrong.  It was taking longer so I gave up using this type of trimmer.  If anyone reading this is obese, or just can&#x27;t reach your toes very well to trim them, this trimmer is not for you.  I would return this product but the package it came in is here anymore.  I will just have to donate it or trash it.  I would not recommend getting this product.  Online or otherwise.</li>
    <li> IT THOUGHT IT SUCKED....I TRIED TO USE IT ONCE &amp; THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE.....</li>
    <li> If it was called a &amp;#34;NAIL MASSAGER&amp;#34; it would be great!  Disappointing!!</li>
    <li> Not to impressed at all. I&#x27;m back to my clippers</li>
    <li> I trim my nails every 2-4 weeks with this. It only takes about 5 minutes. I love it. I think it works incredibly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, you have to also take a few seconds to dump out the filings, then at most a couple of minutes to smooth over a couple of rough edges. I usually have 1 or 2 of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the folks that say it&#x27;s not working, you have to press your nail up firmly against the little rotating drum. Once you do that it will go to work on your nail very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
    <li> this thing is NOT made cheaply very powerful it really works</li>
    <li> This is slow to trim hard nails but my son is able to use it with one hand.</li>
    <li> Very hard to use, constantly stops during use. Save yourself a lot of head aches and stay away from this junk.</li>
    <li> I assumed that the term &amp;#34;nail trimmer&amp;#34; meant that this gadget would actually cut nails.  But actually, it seems to be just an overrated electric nail file.  It requires that the user hold it in one hand while pressing the nail on the other hand against a slim slot, where metal &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; vibrate and sort of file the nail.  The result is that the two hands must be held at an odd angle, very difficult for my elderly mother for whom I bought it, and very difficult for any arthritic, weaker hands.  And there&#x27;s no way she could possibly use it on her toenails.  Also, the nail is left with a rough edge that then needs real filing!  Very disappointed in what I thought would be a big help to my mother.</li>
    <li> Works slowly, but does trim nails without those nasty clippers.</li>
    <li> It works but it&#x27;s not as powerful as it should be, because of that it takes longer to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread for a person with a handicap, I have ALS so it&#x27;s a blessing.... Don A.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t due the job as product said it would</li>
    <li> not designed properly---engineer was more concerned with safety than getting the job done</li>
    <li> This works great on my finger nails but it is not tough enough for toe nails.  Rats!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as advertised -paper weight :(</li>
    <li> Item arrived as stated.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t own this electric nail trimmer, but had the chance to use it -- so I thought I&#x27;d post a review. My sense is that this would be extremely helpful for someone who, for some physical reason, had trouble using a traditional nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have trouble with the traditional nail clipper, you&#x27;re probably thinking &amp;#34;Why bother with the electric gizmo?&amp;#34; I can see that and tend to agree, for me. But for someone who can&#x27;t use a traditional nail clipper, this thing is probably a Godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now the thing you need to know is that it&#x27;s more of a nail nibbler. You put your nail up to the blade opening, and little chips get bit off. You rotate your nail back and forth, and more nails bits get removed. I didn&#x27;t find it to be the smoothest clip I&#x27;ve ever had -- but again, this would be great for someone who really needed it.</li>
    <li> Too difficult to use...takes too long.</li>
    <li> Kind of thin if nail is very thick can&#x27;t get it in the file.</li>
