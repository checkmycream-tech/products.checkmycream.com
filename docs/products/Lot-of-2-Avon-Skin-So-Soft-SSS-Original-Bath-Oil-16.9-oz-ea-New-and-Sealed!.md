<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of my favorite products!</li>
    <li> I love this bath oil ive tried others over the years but this one is the best</li>
    <li> I got it to help with gnats and such.  If it works for that it&#x27;s due to the smell chasing them away; mighty strong, mighty strong.  It&#x27;s also too greasy.</li>
    <li> Skin so Soft has been used by my family for many years as a skin lubricant and mild mosquito repellent.  It is very light, pleasant smelling.  Shipping was very quick.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This was a good amount also.</li>
    <li> Best mosquito repellent out there , and you smell pretty too.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This use to repel mosquitos and it still smells the same I still love it. after all these years :)</li>
    <li> saved my ass in Jamaica.</li>
    <li> Only one bottle was in the package i received instead of the two that was promised.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well they ward off mosquitoes. The wife still gets bit.</li>
    <li> I love this item , i have used it in the past an it helps an will order more in the near future, thank you</li>
    <li> Great value and convent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Skin So Soft for many years.  I love this stuff.  I got two bottles so I could share with my friend, who also loves to use it.  Hope everyone knows it is a great bug repellent as well as skin softener.&lt;br /&gt;Cher Keffer</li>
    <li> Just as expected. Happy to receive my order.&lt;br /&gt;I once sold Avon products, now that I no longer do , I could not do without some of their products myself, Avon Skin So Soft being one of them. Great product, leaves my skin Soft, its an oil but not greasy,in addition it works as an insect repellent....especially mosquitoes.&lt;br /&gt;Use it and tell me if I&#x27;m wrong.. A must have is how I term this product.</li>
    <li> should be called no more mosquitos  smile  great product  smells great</li>
    <li> I used this to make a home-made bug spray. It worked wonderful and I still have some left to make more later.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff! Keeps bugs away (not just mosquitoes) kept me from burning (didn&#x27;t apply sunblock but didn&#x27;t burn and I do! Badly, normally) and acted as a barrier to poison ivy (I&#x27;m highly allergic) Absolutely marvelous stuff!</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE-this product works so well. It also makes cleaning the bathtub much much easier!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Works on maintaining dry feet.</li>
    <li> Used this product as a mosquito repellent for my dog team. Diluted with water it worked well. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This Lot of 2 Avon Skin So Soft SSS Original Bath Oil was purchased as a gift for mother to help sooth her skin after the radiation treatment she took while fighting breast cancer. This was recommended by the support staff at Johns Hopkins and it really helped her get through the unpleasant parts of the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> Shipped on time and was exactly as described :)</li>
    <li> I make fly spray for my horses with this. Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it in my bath and it smells great.  I got two large bottles on Amazon for a great price. It really moisturizes the skin.</li>
    <li> Bought to remove bandage tape. Works great.</li>
    <li> Great except the cap is a twist on/off and not the normal flip cap with a small opening. Should be used as refill bottles only because too difficult to pour from such a large mouth opening.</li>
    <li> I bought this product specifically to keep the mosquitos away.  I moved to the desert where they are small, fast &amp; sneaky and will leave a giant welt once they get you!  I recall hearing that this helped.  I used it last night on my body and I liberally sprayed my sheets (I put this in a bottle specifically designed for essential oils) and it was the first night I awoke without being bitten and scratching until dawn.  HOWEVER...the scent is AWFUL!  If you like baby powder, you&#x27;ll like the scent.  Personally, I despise it!  But if it works, I&#x27;m willing to suffer the scent over the bites!  The oil is nice and gives your skin a nice &#x27;glow&#x27;.  I apply it after my evening shower, in the morning upon waking, again midday and again before my pups and I head outdoors for our evening playtime (yes, I&#x27;m paranoid about being bitten!).  Then of course, after the shower.  I WISH it had a nicer smell.  No offense to the little &#x27;ol ladies out there because one day I hope to be one....but I feel like I smell like a little &#x27;ol lady and I&#x27;m too young for that!  At the same token, I also smell like a baby being diapered!  LOL!  I also bought the Avon Bug Repellant SPF as well as the Anti-Itch.  If I haven&#x27;t yet attacked the bite with scratching, the anti-itch seems to work.  But if it&#x27;s been scratched, I tend to go for straight Tea Tree Oil and ice packs.  I hate mosquitos!!!!!!  The scent makes me want to give it 0-stars...but to be fair, I&#x27;m giving it 4 since it seems to keep my skin &#x27;so soft&#x27; and the mosquitos away :)  I have to laugh that someone didn&#x27;t find this review helpful.  I mentioned it kept the mosquitos away and that it did make my skin soft but I found the scent repelling.  What information are you looking for that I may have missed?!</li>
    <li> Same Skin So Soft that I remember. I used both bottles, and they are we&#x27;re both equally as great as I remember. It works as an excellent mosquito repellant, and I packaged it into those amber containers and gave them out at an outdoor event. No&lt;br /&gt;Complaints</li>
    <li> I use this on my poodles after I bathe them, makes their coats shiny and it also prevents fleas.</li>
    <li> great buy, would buy again</li>
    <li> Skin so Soft is SO difficult to find anymore!  These were a great price so I ordered 4 bottles (my friend and neighbor likes it so I gave her one as she has been looking for an Avon Rep. to purchase from but there are none).  The chemicals that are in our water, dries my skin even more than my mild eczema.  I put Skin so Soft on after patting dry before my skin is completely dry.  My pores pull it in and I stay soft even on elbows and ankles, not to mention behind my knees.  Excellent product and a very reasonable price, which was nice for a change!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product because it works and it never feels sticky when it dry on your skin, plus it keeps the mosquitos away.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love love love this product. I have been using it since I was 15 years old and now I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and my skin is so soft and always smells good.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This has always been a great product for your itchy dogs skin. Also works great as an after shower body oil!</li>
    <li> Grat for the bugs.  A friend told me they used it for their dogs rash and the rash went away in two days.  I tried it on my dog with the same results.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I enjoy bathing in sss.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have sweet blood and the bugs love me.  I hate to slather myself in bug spray but I am miserable when I get bitten.  The scent is a bit &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;  but it dissipates and it softens my skin.  Most importantly, it keeps the gnats, no-seeums and mosquitoes away from me.</li>
    <li> I use SSS everyday in the shower before toweling off lightly. I&#x27;m also convinced it keeps away mosquitoes. And I smell great!</li>
    <li> We just discovered yet another highly practical use for Skin-So-Soft...it&#x27;s not only an excellent bath oil, or a super effective anti-mosquito repellent, but it&#x27;s also a radical dispursant of the Natural Seepage here at El Capitan State Beach! You do not need baby oil to remove the tar from your feet..!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It makes a good mosquito repellant without the DEET or sticky/stinky side effects.</li>
    <li> Exact and transferred to small spray bottles for the best smelling bug control on the block.  Arrived perfectly and leak free.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff ... really good for my stinky teenagers.</li>
    <li> I use it for a muskito repellant.  just could not turn down the price.  excellent price.  i am very pleased. I will deffenitly use this vendor again in the near future. thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft for over 50 years!!  I use it every day and I love the way my skin feels so soft!!  I will use this product every day for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Good smell and feel on your skin.</li>
    <li> Skin so soft bath oil is the cure for dry skin. During the summer when I take a bath after a long day of swimming I use this oil and its a skin saver I also love the smell its a family tradition in my family to use this!</li>
    <li> I love Skin so Soft, original by Avon.  I have been using it for years.  I don&#x27;t know about the price.  I have not compared it to what it would cost to purchase directly from Avon.</li>
    <li> Keeps the mosquitoes away!</li>
    <li> very nice but it leaves scum on the bathtub and it&#x27;s very slippery. so you have to be careful tonot fall while getting out of the tub.</li>
    <li> Use Skin so soft to make homemade fly spray for the horses. I use half spray bottle of white vinegar, almost half of skin so soft and a big squirt of Ivory dish soap. Works as well as top brand fly sprays. It does make a greasy mess on the hair.., not for horse shows.</li>
    <li> I brought this with me to a camp site. I had heard that it makes a great repellant from insects.  I didn&#x27;t get even one bite on me. Some of the guys were willing to use it but a couple of the macho men didn&#x27;t.  The next morning those that didn&#x27;t use it were having to put medicine on their mosquito bites.  It works and it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I have used this product foe years. Not only is rhis the most soothing, moisturising product I have ever used, it has a great scent. It also helps prevent mosqitos! Not like a DEET product would of course, but it helps. I add a small amount of it to my bodywash and shake it up. It makes it a luxurious experience!&lt;br /&gt;Alone, or with my bodywash, this product has stood the test of time.</li>
    <li> Great refills for my home made bug, tick repellent.</li>
    <li> I ordered Avon Skin so Soft for only one purpose.  I heard from a friend that it was effective as a mosquito repellent.  It worked very well for me.  The mosquito situation here in south Florida is quite severe.  After applying this product, I was not bitten even once in my back yard. It does not have the terrible smell of other bug repellants.  I will be testing Skin so Soft on my next trip to the Florida keys.  They have a much more aggressive type and a lot bigger mosquitoes in the mangroves.</li>
    <li> Item delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> Note that the cap on these unscrews and you have the full neck of the bottle (no squirting, etc), so you can dump a lot on your hands quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these for keeping mosquitoes at bay and not having to put harsh chemicals on my body.</li>
    <li> Many uses for Skin so Soft.  It is  safe to use for all ages</li>
    <li> Ants seem to hate this; so I use this only for ant prevention and eradication.</li>
    <li> I was told that this stuff would be a great natural insect repellent so that is the whole reason I bought it.  It did not work on repelling insects for me.  It actually seemed to attract them and I got more bites than normal while using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bath oil it is fine and probably deserves more like 3 stars.  The smell is woodsy and not my favorite.  The cap just turns on and off so it is difficult to control how much comes out without pouring a whole bunch out.  I ended up spilling a ton all over my nightstand because of this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Great for making your skin soft and also a great mosquito/bug repellant.</li>
    <li> My go to product for flies and other biting insects that bother my horse.  He is allergic to the bites and all other sprays (organic or not).  Lasts for several days and some times up to a week.</li>
    <li> Bought this oil for my horse to keep those pesky flies away. Didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my mom she love it</li>
    <li> the product is outstanding as always.</li>
    <li> Skin-So-Soft is a great Avon product!!  This size is perfect and was delivered quickly.  Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> fight off those misquitos!</li>
    <li> The anti mosquito properties are already well known for Skin So Soft. I spent four months in the Caribbean and I hated using any bug repellant, chemical or natural, because they either irritate after too much use or coat the skin and make you really hot because you can&#x27;t sweat. I certainly didn&#x27;t wear the Skin So Soft during the day. But we slept under mosquito nets. And it would cool down some at night, or at least we were less active so our bodies remained a bit cooler. Someone had sent some bottles of Skin So Soft with me and one of the rituals I really enjoyed was after my evening shower, I would rub my body down with it. It&#x27;s too hot to use moisturizer during the day in a tropical climate. But for the night it was a nice feeling after a shower. And it gave protection from the mosquitos between the time I took my shower and when I got under my bed net. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite scent but I don&#x27;t mind it and it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my allergies. Now I&#x27;m headed to tropical Asian countries for a while, and so I am packing along some bottles of Skin So Soft.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as a mosquito repellant and it appears to do a decent job at it.</li>
    <li> I love this product by Avon.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that I can purchase this and get it faster than from a local Avon rep. Don&#x27;t care what they say about the scent..it&#x27;s 100 x&#x27;s better than getting bitten by mosquitoes and the having marks o  your legs and arms. Ot definitely keeps the mosquitoes away. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> There are so many other uses of this product other than a luxuious bath, great product.</li>
    <li> I have always used this product initially buying it from Avon.  I use it in the shower and I am able that I can now get it on Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Use frequently and is great bath oil Also great to put in bath for dogs as it helps their skin but only put a cap full,</li>
    <li> Wifey loves this stuff..!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent for getting rid of flees&amp; ticks plus relieve dry skin for your dog.</li>
    <li> Gentle bug repelant for my baby. Love this product my parents used it on me as a child, glad it&#x27;s still around!</li>
    <li> The smell is intoxicating!  Gotta by a case of this it is my new signature scent!  Lol</li>
    <li> I have always liked this product.  It has a rather peppery smell to it that I would rather it didn&#x27;t have but don&#x27;t find it offensive.  I wish they came with spray pumps as it would make it easier to apply but I will buy a bottle with spray pump, fill it up and problem solved.</li>
    <li> This may not be everyone&#x27;s fave but if u put it on and go outside the bugs will leave u alone and u smell good too, And I am a bug magnet.  I rub it on my legs when they hurt and I can tell the difference, and my grandson sleeps like a baby when he done with his bath and put the oil on lol</li>
    <li> Everything was great.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to repel rouge mosquitoes. Its also smells nice and isn&#x27;t to oily. It was also a great buy.</li>
    <li> Received products in a timely manner with products intact.</li>
    <li> I bought it to use as insect-repellent, but it&#x27;s very greasy and seems to attract dirt like a magnet. Now I just use a squirt bottle of water with a few drops of lavender essential oil to repel bugs. Smells good and seems to work for me.</li>
    <li> what can you say about skin so soft it is awesome wife loves it smells great fast shipping well packaged better to buy this way more ounces for you money.</li>
    <li> I use this as a fly repellent for my horse.  (Sorry Avon) but it really works.  Best of all I&#x27;m not spending a fortune on harsh chemicals that can harm Abby.  We both use it during fly season at the barn!</li>
    <li> Ordered the Avon Skin So Soft to use as a healthy alternative for flea &amp; tick protection for our outside dog. I am happy to say that is works wonderfully! He doesn&#x27;t mind it at all, keeps the fleas &amp; ticks off and he smells great too! Keeps his coat shining and he feels so much better. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s good. Some strange bug is bitting me this keeps them off me at night. It&#x27;s not bedbugs some type of invisible mite.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! Perfect for mosquitoes in the spring and summer and it  smells good too.</li>
    <li> Bought this to make a homemade horsefly spray for my horse. Great product and great price!</li>
    <li> Really helps stop mosquito bites</li>
    <li> love it need to Oder some more works well to keep the bugs off</li>
    <li> This product was delivered as promised and arrived in very good condition.  SOS is a product offered by AVON and can be used to deter mosquitos in the summer in addition to keeping your skin soft.</li>
    <li> The wife uses this in the bath to keep her skin soft.  Hey.....it works and she&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m a happy camper, as well.  One thing about Amazon.....the first shipment showed being delivered, but we never got it.  Amazon sent a replacement.....at no charge.....to our home the very next day.  That&#x27;s kind of hard to beat.  It&#x27;s stuff like that that keeps me coming back.</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate the smell of this stuff but then again, so do horse flies. I wash my mare with some in the water and I give her tail a good coat of it. It keeps the flies off for a good long while. You can watch mosquitoes avoid spots on your arm where it has been applied. Not the intended use I am sure, but it beets Deet.</li>
    <li> i have ordered these for my hurrycane / tornado emergency kit. will use to bathe without water and also is a good insect repellant. i llive in florida</li>
    <li> I like this product because it has a rather light fragrance, which is really nice in warm weather.  Although it says it is an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; I don,&#x27;t find it to be greasy.  And yes, it does work in repelling insects.‼</li>
    <li> It would be awesome if there was some kind of dispenser on these bottles. I appreciate the anti-mosquito properties (the reason I bought it), but I wasn&#x27;t expecting to have to find another bottle that allowed me to dispense smaller amounts. Big giant bottle of oil, big giant opening...not safe in the shower!</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick. The price was okay.</li>
    <li> It had been a long while since I had this product, but I was very pleased to find that it hadn&#x27;t changed.  Still great.</li>
    <li> I apply this just like I do lotion. It does smell good but is not quite heavy enough for my very dry skin. Since dry skin is worse in the Winter now that it&#x27;s getting warmer it may work better for me.</li>
    <li> What I don&#x27;t like about these is the top.  You have a top enclosed, but you can&#x27;t get it out. So you have use the main top and pour, for the most part, more than you need. The help you receive to try and open it twisting and holding as the instructions state. I had two strong men try per instruction, leaving top prints in their hands. To no avail, we still can&#x27;t get them out. The company should send the two tops that work.</li>
    <li> The product was fine I just expected some sort of spray nozzle to get it out, not by using my hand to dump it in!!!!</li>
    <li> This smell brings back good memories. I love the smell, and how soft my skin feels after I use it.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. Price was good too.</li>
    <li> excellent for mosquitos</li>
    <li> You gotta love Skin So Soft!  It&#x27;s not only great bath oil, but it&#x27;s great for keeping bugs off in the summer.  I use it before I go out to garden and I never get so much as a gnat on me.  And - my skin is nice and soft too!</li>
    <li> I love it. it makes my skin so smooth</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for keeping the summer bugs off of me, my family and the horses!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with item!</li>
    <li> Works okay for mosquito repellant. Smell is pleasant</li>
    <li> we live in Arkansas were every bug seems to bite but, not with this stuff on. we put it in a spray bottle and apply after a shower. we end up bite free with super spft skin</li>
    <li> The best insect repellant around. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday and keeps my skin ever so soft.</li>
    <li> Avon needs to put a better spout on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Every thing met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Used this for fleas.  Lasted for 8 hours at least.</li>
    <li> keeps the mesquitos away</li>
