### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and now they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
      <li>Would be perfect for men whose nails split a lot.</li>
      <li>After just one use I am so impressed.  </li>
      <li>this is the perfect product to buy.  </li>
      <li>It keeps the nails and cuticles in great shape and makes the nails grow faster.</li>
      <li>I love this Nutra Nail Growth Treatment Formula, I t works great for my nail</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>It is nice as a cuticle oil.</li>
      <li>You have to place it twice a day or even more if you have time..</li>
      <li>Maybe others who used the product for a longer time might find it performed better for them, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
      <li>My nails grew about a inch or more in just one week...</li>
      <li>but it is ok.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Want longer nails fast try this product I have used it and works great esp.</li>
      <li>It feels more like an oil or a lotion</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for a good year and it really helps.</li>
      <li>I use it on my nails 1-2 times a day and it makes my nails nice and strong, and grow very fast.</li>
      <li>If you want really long nails then go for nail polish, but if you want enough nail to pick up a dime or scratch an itch, this works perfectly to keep them even and strong.</li>
      <li>my nails were super flaky and would chip all the way to the quick, but i&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 8 days now</li>
      <li>Because I&#x27;ve tried everything else, bettering my diet was first.</li>
      <li>It works exactly like it is supposed to.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so effective that if I use it for 2-3 months, then skip a week, when that weaker part of the nails grows off the nail bed, all the nails may shorten within a day or two of each other.</li>
      <li>yet not as fast as it says (7 days haha!)</li>
      <li>I have a nail biting problem and since I got this product my nails have started growing twice as fast.</li>
      <li>I read all the reat reviews about this nail strenghtener and i was ready to give it a shot..  </li>
      <li>and I always wash dishes without gloves on and don&#x27;t care for my nails how I should, so my nails are usually very brittle and peel off at the ends leaving hangnails and ragged edges.  </li>
      <li>I use this product for my nails because they have a fungus and this stuff really works.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>It is ok, not really worth it in my book</li>
      <li>I love my new natural long nails now..</li>
      <li>tried it continuously but never seen a change in my nails as far as any sort of nail growth.had a nice little smell to it</li>
      <li>I have purchased this item previously and I still love the results.  </li>
      <li>i took one star off purely because i should have assumed this product was an oil, but it doesn&#x27;t dry or absorb quickly</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
      <li>I love this product bought it a few weeks ago and cant stop using it.</li>
      <li>but the price was too low to make it worth all the fuss</li>
      <li>well i noticed that using this works better if i don&amp;#34;t wash my hands after (so before goind to get or so).. my nails are not that long BUT have never been as long as they are now that am using it..</li>
      <li>The only con is the consistency, its very liquidy and takes FOREVER to dry but its well worth it to me.</li>
      <li>A few years ago I threw it out because it was so old, even though it always seemed to work fine.  </li>
      <li>only negative thing I can say so far about the new formula is that it has a strong smell - the keratin no doubt.  </li>
      <li>I have tried lots of other nail hardeners/strengtheners, have probably spent 100 bucks or more trying to find one that will let my nails grow, but this has been the only one that worked for me.  </li>
      <li>I have had better and have used worse</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s okay because it was totally worth it, just a little inconvenient.</li>

<li> I have had better and have used worse</li>
<li> it&#x27;s okay because it was totally worth it, just a little inconvenient.</li>
<li> It needs to be applied 2-3 times a day and left to dry for about 3 minutes for maximum effectiveness, but this can be done while in the bathroom, on the phone or flipping through a magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t, and my nails remained dry, bendable, and prone to split and layer.</li>
<li> i also like to put it on the dry skin around my nails it works for that too!</li>
<li> No more fake nails :)</li>
<li> aftering removing fake nails helps promote brittle damaged nails quickly..</li>
<li> It smells a little like gross fish.  </li>
<li> This is not nail polish; it goes on wet and dries, leaving no trace.  </li>
<li> It is as described, it does the job and in not much time!</li>
<li> Most others I have tried are like a base coat nail polish.  </li>
<li> I have used up half of the bottle already as directed</li>
<li> I forgot about this product until reading about it online today and went to buy the newer green tea formula.  </li>
<li> It makes my nails robust, and after a few weeks I can even miss a day here and there.  </li>
<li> Once a day for a few weeks</li>
<li> But it goes away after a few minutes.  </li>
<li> It gets rid of the crap and makes nails much stronger.</li>
<li> highly recommend this product for nail bitter like me you will not be disappointing !!!!</li>
<li> If you have thin nails that break or tear this is the product for you.</li>
<li> try this out if you have thin or brittle nails.  </li>
<li> It is a thin oil which you rub into your nail.</li>
<li> This is merely a cuticle oil.</li>
<li> I thought it would be a nail growth polish I could apply as a base coat.</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have nails that split and layer, and I bought this hoping it would make a difference. Part of why I chose this was because you massage the oil into each nail and I thought that would do the trick. It didn&#x27;t, and my nails remained dry, bendable, and prone to split and layer. I should have sent it back but the price was too low to make it worth all the fuss so I just threw it out. Maybe others who used the product for a longer time might find it performed better for them, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck with it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item previously and I still love the results.  If anyone has problems with their nails growing...this is the perfect product to buy.  It works exactly like it is supposed to.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for a good year and it really helps. It keeps the nails and cuticles in great shape and makes the nails grow faster.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my nails because they have a fungus and this stuff really works. It gets rid of the crap and makes nails much stronger.</li>
    <li> my nails really deteriorated after i&#x27;d been doing housekeeping and working around harsh chemicals for three years. my nails were super flaky and would chip all the way to the quick, but i&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 8 days now and my nails look shiny and aren&#x27;t chipping. i filed out all the chips and applied this oil and now they&#x27;re awesome. i took one star off purely because i should have assumed this product was an oil, but it doesn&#x27;t dry or absorb quickly so you just have to go without using your hands for +5 mins. it&#x27;s okay because it was totally worth it, just a little inconvenient.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I use it on my nails 1-2 times a day and it makes my nails nice and strong, and grow very fast. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product bought it a few weeks ago and cant stop using it. i also like to put it on the dry skin around my nails it works for that too!</li>
    <li> This nail growth treatment did not help my nails grow and did not help strengthen my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this Nutra Nail Growth Treatment Formula, I t works great for my nail, I have a healthier nail that doesn&#x27;t brook easily.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for nail bitter like me you will not be disappointing !!!!</li>
    <li> yet not as fast as it says (7 days haha!).. well i noticed that using this works better if i don&amp;#34;t wash my hands after (so before goind to get or so).. my nails are not that long BUT have never been as long as they are now that am using it.. hopefully if they go on growing like that without breaking, it&#x27;ll be an A+</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I have a nail biting problem and since I got this product my nails have started growing twice as fast. Love it</li>
    <li> If you have thin nails that break or tear this is the product for you. I put it on my nails every night as i go to bed and in no time my nails are unbelieveable.  GO FOR IT.</li>
    <li> This is not nail polish; it goes on wet and dries, leaving no trace.  Would be perfect for men whose nails split a lot. It needs to be applied 2-3 times a day and left to dry for about 3 minutes for maximum effectiveness, but this can be done while in the bathroom, on the phone or flipping through a magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It makes my nails robust, and after a few weeks I can even miss a day here and there.

    <li> I had high hopes for this product but it&#x27;s not a nail polish. This is merely a cuticle oil. It is a thin oil which you rub into your nail. I thought it would be a nail growth polish I could apply as a base coat. I have used up half of the bottle already as directed and I see no growth to my nails. It is nice as a cuticle oil.</li>
    <li> tried it continuously but never seen a change in my nails as far as any sort of nail growth.had a nice little smell to it tho.that was about it</li>
    <li> I read all the reat reviews about this nail strenghtener and i was ready to give it a shot..  I dont regret buying it.. My nails grew about a inch or more in just one week... You have to place it twice a day or even more if you have time.. I love my new natural long nails now.. No more fake nails :) yay!!</li>
    <li> I saw this and the price and thought I should try it. It is ok, not really worth it in my book but it is ok. I have had better and have used worse, I guess it is up to the buyer.</li>
    <li> It is as described, it does the job and in not much time! The only con is the consistency, its very liquidy and takes FOREVER to dry but its well worth it to me. Once a day for a few weeks and my nails were stronger and longer!</li>
    <li> Want longer nails fast try this product I have used it and works great esp. aftering removing fake nails helps promote brittle damaged nails quickly..</li>
    <li> It has helped my fingernails improve!  Because I&#x27;ve tried everything else, bettering my diet was first. now we&#x27;ll c , they r diffenatley stronger with this product.</li>
    <li> I give Nutra Nail Growth Treatment five stars for one reason: it works!  I have tried lots of other nail hardeners/strengtheners, have probably spent 100 bucks or more trying to find one that will let my nails grow, but this has been the only one that worked for me.  Most others I have tried are like a base coat nail polish.  This is a completely different type of treatment.  It feels more like an oil or a lotion and you are supposed to massage it into your fingers and under your nail tips after you paint it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a lifetime nail biter and I always wash dishes without gloves on and don&#x27;t care for my nails how I should, so my nails are usually very brittle and peel off at the ends leaving hangnails and ragged edges.  I tried this stuff when I was in middle school when a friend gave it to me for a birthday present and I have kept it in my nail supplies since.  A few years ago I threw it out because it was so old, even though it always seemed to work fine.  I forgot about this product until reading about it online today and went to buy the newer green tea formula.  After just one use I am so impressed.  My nails feel stronger and my cuticles feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can say so far about the new formula is that it has a strong smell - the keratin no doubt.  It smells a little like gross fish.  But it goes away after a few minutes.  When I had my hair straightened with keratin I smelled it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But try this out if you have thin or brittle nails.  It might work for you too!</li>
