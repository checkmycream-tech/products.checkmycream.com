      <li>they did help me, and the best thing no smell.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that my baby boy is no longer breech!</li>
      <li>this acuzone smokeless moxa rolls are great instead of acupuncture!!!</li>
      <li>It is smokeless, so it works perfect at home, you won&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
      <li>i used them for my kidneys and are of great quality !</li>
      <li>Then I ordered these, so that I can do the moxibustion inside, and they work perfectly.</li>
      <li>So these were great because they were smokeless, and stayed lit for quite awhile.</li>
      <li>Great help in alleviating my muscle aches and stiffness.</li>
      <li>I got these because my acupuncturist recommended them for a ganglion cyst and they worked great.</li>
      <li>very good moxa, recommended by my acupuncturist, arrived very quickly!</li>
      <li>So it is a good</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>This item was shipped quickly and product works great!</li>
      <li>Seems to be the best I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
      <li>They did burn very hot which was good.  </li>
      <li>Still, they were just okay</li>
      <li>Love, love, love</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>it does its job what it meant to do, I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Arrived safely and on time.</li>
      <li>and I found that they would cracked or have the tip break off more easily.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>but regardless it is cheap and completely safe, which is why we tried it to begin with.</li>
      <li>Warm the body right up for energy work.</li>
      <li>While none of the moxa-rolls were easy to light and getting burning, I found these took the longest to get them fully lite.  </li>
      <li>Last long and good heat, stay together well, great!</li>
      <li>They are also easiest to light using a gas burner or a creme brulee torch if you have one.  </li>
      <li>(sure it could have been coincidence, but what are the chances the baby turns on its own at the same time you finish a treatment?)</li>
      <li>the positive side they were mostly smokeless.  </li>
      <li>moxa, positioning, or his own natural inclination.</li>
      <li>That is if it can only light!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the medical field in the U.S. and honestly didnt really expect this to work so well for turning breech babies, but the statistics suggested it may work, and it was cheap</li>
      <li>turned because it wanted to, but I felt it was worth the effort to help baby turn.  </li>
      <li>They are truly smokeless, however they do give off a distinct fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I ordered this brand online</li>
      <li>Personally I still prefer the smoke one, I just love the smell of herbs.</li>
      <li>I am a RN and tend to not believe in a lot of &amp;#34;hocus pocus&amp;#34; but I bought these willing to try anything to turn my breech  baby.</li>
      <li>it made the almost the whole antepartum floor stink!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>and were exactly as described/pictured.</li>
      <li>Moxibustion is a simple alternative to accupuncture that can be used at home to treat many symptoms.</li>
      <li>You can feel the heat while using it but not as effective as other brands...</li>
      <li>(wet a cotton ball with alcohol and light that, then light the roll from that flame), so they work very well for me.</li>
      <li>Yes, they are pretty much smokeless</li>
      <li>The moxa gave off such a strong odor, even with a towel rolled under my door</li>
      <li>We had an ultra sound coincidentally the following day to confirm, but almost immediately after doing this technique to my wife for around 25 minutes, she started to complain that the baby was twisting and hurting her.  </li>
      <li>If the whole tip of the roll does not glow when you blow on them, they aren&#x27;t ready to go.</li>
      <li>A candle will work, but it will take a longer time to get them burning to the point they are ready do go.  </li>
      <li>But without a doubt, the moxa sticks did make him more active in utero.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very helpful for natural healing!!</li>
      <li>Both times it made baby extremely active, even more so than normal.</li>
      <li>I also tried another type of Moxa rolls but these ones I was able to use indoors because the smoke was much less and the odor didn&#x27;t get everywhere.</li>
      <li>With the help of the Moxa rolls and some yoga type positions, my baby turned, so I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>What did turn my breech baby was waiting until she was super active (around midnight), then sitting stick straight on the edge of a rocking chair, and rocking for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Does not get as hot as the traditional moxa either!</li>
      <li>It actually turned my baby the FIRST night</li>
      <li>My acupuncturist wants me to do moxibustion for twenty minutes a day every day, and I was doing fine with the regular moxa sticks she gave me (the smoky kind), until it got really cold outside.</li>
      <li>The cyst was greatly reduced after only a few uses and within a few weeks it was completely gone.</li>
      <li>the smokeless moxa is awesome, as a massage therapist i use it for selfcare treatment, and the deep penetrating heat brings healing quickly to painful areas and injury.</li>
      <li>Give it a try It can&#x27;t hurt as far as I know.</li>
      <li>I wish the seller kept the quality, since I have found that the stick is more easy to be broken than my previous order.</li>
      <li>They have a light smell and while they didn&#x27;t get my breech baby to flip (like we had hoped), it definitely made her very active.</li>
      <li>All brands of smokeless moxa-rolls we used did smoke a little and it has a distinct incense smell, but these were tolerable.  </li>
      <li>Hard to light, but my practitioner told me how to do it</li>
      <li>Once you light it up, it&#x27;s hard to keep it lit.</li>
      <li>Well Eastern medicine wins this round.  </li>
      <li>I didnt even use half of the stick, and ever since the first night, our baby has stayed vertex.  </li>
      <li>My husband held near my pinky toes in the kitchen and we just left the window open.</li>
      <li>It is smokeless, indeed but very hard to light.</li>
      <li>We were provided two other brands by our therapy center where my wife had it performed the first time.  </li>

<li> It is smokeless, indeed but very hard to light.</li>
<li> We were provided two other brands by our therapy center where my wife had it performed the first time.  </li>
<li> And for turning a breech baby it is recommeded that they are used for 20 minutes, so the sticks were long enough to last the 20 minutes.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s still a tiny bit of smoke released but it&#x27;s minimal, especially compared to the regular moxa sticks.</li>

<li> Also, my doctor said he didn&#x27;t care if I used it in my hospital room as long as I didn&#x27;t set the smoke detector off.  </li>
<li> Leaves a black residue on finger because it&#x27;s not wrapped in anther hung like traditional moxa.</li>
<li> That means I go through a box in ten days, which is a little quicker than I was hoping.</li>
<li> Since you generally need to use two at a time, it seems odd to provide an odd number in the box.  </li>
<li> 3 days after the last time we used them, we went to the Dr and found out that our son had flipped into a head down position!</li>
<li> few tips for using these would include using them outside as the smell from the moxa-rolls will stick around for a while.  </li>
<li> , traditional moxa was helping to shrink them and stop heavy bleeding.</li>
<li> I did this twice and other spinning baby methods.  </li>
<li> will recommend to other who are looking in to moxas.</li>
<li> I would feel baby get slightly active, but it did not turn him.  </li>
<li> Made the baby active but didn&#x27;t work in my case.</li>
<li> I was on hospital bed rest for 3 months and was using this to try to turn my baby from breech to head down.  </li>
<li> But other than this, I give this product five stars!</li>
<li> His head is now down!</li>
<li> My only complaint is that the sticks themselves are an awkward length - each one burns for about 40 minutes and then gets down to the nub, so I can&#x27;t hold them without burning myself.</li>
<li> sticks themselves are small, but they burn slowly.</li>
<li> Was doubtful at first...</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t too bad though, and by the next morning the smell was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Just be very, very careful not to touch yourself with them while in use, it will leave a nasty 2nd degree burn.</li>
<li> The nurses hated it!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Seems to be the best I&#x27;ve used so far! Thanks! Last long and good heat, stay together well, great! Love it.</li>
    <li> Tried to flip a breech birth. Made the baby active but didn&#x27;t work in my case. I would still recommend use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used moxa sticks for some time.  This is the first time I ordered this brand online and they work as I would expect.  Arrived safely and on time.</li>
    <li> It is smokeless, so it works perfect at home, you won&#x27;t smell anything. Personally I still prefer the smoke one, I just love the smell of herbs.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My acupuncturist wants me to do moxibustion for twenty minutes a day every day, and I was doing fine with the regular moxa sticks she gave me (the smoky kind), until it got really cold outside. Then I ordered these, so that I can do the moxibustion inside, and they work perfectly. There&#x27;s still a tiny bit of smoke released but it&#x27;s minimal, especially compared to the regular moxa sticks. My only complaint is that the sticks themselves are an awkward length - each one burns for about 40 minutes and then gets down to the nub, so I can&#x27;t hold them without burning myself. That means I go through a box in ten days, which is a little quicker than I was hoping. But other than this, I give this product five stars!</li>
    <li> I used the sticks to assist in turning my breech baby at the suggestion of a midwife.. With the help of the Moxa rolls and some yoga type positions, my baby turned, so I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> They do the job... smoke. There is an acupuncture belief that using these will help turn a breach baby. It doesn&#x27;t work for that.</li>
    <li> My boxes arrived even faster than promised (thank you!) and were exactly as described/pictured. They have a light smell and while they didn&#x27;t get my breech baby to flip (like we had hoped), it definitely made her very active.</li>
    <li> My wife and I bought these Moxa-Rolls to do at home moxibustion to try to get our baby girl to flip.  While it didn&#x27;t work for us, that isn&#x27;t what I am basing my review on.  These were the third type of moxa-rolls we used.  We were provided two other brands by our therapy center where my wife had it performed the first time.  We used all three brands over a couple week period and I have to say AcuZone was the hardest to work with.  Since you generally need to use two at a time, it seems odd to provide an odd number in the box.  While none of the moxa-rolls were easy to light and getting burning, I found these took the longest to get them fully lite.  Once lite, I didn&#x27;t care for the way they burned.  The ash was more difficult to get off the stick than other brands and I found that they would cracked or have the tip break off more easily.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side they were mostly smokeless.  All brands of smokeless moxa-rolls we used did smoke a little and it has a distinct incense smell, but these were tolerable.  They did burn very hot which was good.  Still, they were just okay for me.&lt;br /&gt;A few tips for using these would include using them outside as the smell from the moxa-rolls will stick around for a while.  They are also easiest to light using a gas burner or a creme brulee torch if you have one.  A candle will work, but it will take a longer time to get them burning to the point they are ready do go.  If the whole tip of the roll does not glow when you blow on them, they aren&#x27;t ready to go.</li>
    <li> it does its job what it meant to do, I am satisfied. will recommend to other who are looking in to moxas.</li>
    <li> I was on hospital bed rest for 3 months and was using this to try to turn my baby from breech to head down.  I would feel baby get slightly active, but it did not turn him.  Also, my doctor said he didn&#x27;t care if I used it in my hospital room as long as I didn&#x27;t set the smoke detector off.  The nurses hated it!  The moxa gave off such a strong odor, even with a towel rolled under my door it made the almost the whole antepartum floor stink!</li>
    <li> Warm the body right up for energy work.</li>
    <li> very good moxa, recommended by my acupuncturist, arrived very quickly! will definitely re-order from them&lt;br /&gt;again</li>
    <li> This is the brand name I trust.  I wish the seller kept the quality, since I have found that the stick is more easy to be broken than my previous order.</li>
    <li> Yes, they are pretty much smokeless but there is still smoke. You can feel the heat while using it but not as effective as other brands...</li>
    <li> I got these because my acupuncturist recommended them for a ganglion cyst and they worked great. The cyst was greatly reduced after only a few uses and within a few weeks it was completely gone. They are truly smokeless and not stinky like regular Moxa. Just be very, very careful not to touch yourself with them while in use, it will leave a nasty 2nd degree burn. I don&#x27;t recommend using these at all without the advice of your acupuncturist or Chinese Medicine practitioner.</li>
    <li> the smokeless moxa is awesome, as a massage therapist i use it for selfcare treatment, and the deep penetrating heat brings healing quickly to painful areas and injury. Love, love, love</li>
    <li> This item was shipped quickly and product works great! Great help in alleviating my muscle aches and stiffness. Moxibustion is a simple alternative to accupuncture that can be used at home to treat many symptoms. Thank you!</li>
    <li> They are truly smokeless. Hard to light, but my practitioner told me how to do it (wet a cotton ball with alcohol and light that, then light the roll from that flame), so they work very well for me.</li>
    <li> This moxa sticks burn faster than others.</li>
    <li> They work and they had no smell, I will continue using this one. they did help me, and the best thing no smell.</li>
    <li> It is smokeless, indeed but very hard to light. Once you light it up, it&#x27;s hard to keep it lit.</li>
    <li> My wife and I purchased these moxa sticks to help try and turn our breech baby. We used them 2 different times on both toes at the same times. Both times it made baby extremely active, even more so than normal. 3 days after the last time we used them, we went to the Dr and found out that our son had flipped into a head down position! We were at 34 weeks. My wife had also been doing breech tilts, so we don&#x27;t know what made him flip.....moxa, positioning, or his own natural inclination. But without a doubt, the moxa sticks did make him more active in utero.&lt;br /&gt;The sticks themselves are small, but they burn slowly. And for turning a breech baby it is recommeded that they are used for 20 minutes, so the sticks were long enough to last the 20 minutes. They are truly smokeless, however they do give off a distinct fragrance. It isn&#x27;t too bad though, and by the next morning the smell was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these for someone trying to get their breech baby to turn. I don&#x27;t k now if it was the sticks that flipped out so n, but regardless it is cheap and completely safe, which is why we tried it to begin with. Good product.</li>
    <li> I did this twice and other spinning baby methods.  This was the only thing I did the day before the baby turned.  Can&#x27;t prove it did it or the baby turned because it wanted to, but I felt it was worth the effort to help baby turn.  Give it a try It can&#x27;t hurt as far as I know.</li>
    <li> Turning a breech baby... Was doubtful at first... I am a RN and tend to not believe in a lot of &amp;#34;hocus pocus&amp;#34; but I bought these willing to try anything to turn my breech  baby. Used them one evening and the following morning for 20 minutes and I&#x27;m happy to say that my baby boy is no longer breech! His head is now down! I also tried another type of Moxa rolls but these ones I was able to use indoors because the smoke was much less and the odor didn&#x27;t get everywhere. My husband held near my pinky toes in the kitchen and we just left the window open.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the medical field in the U.S. and honestly didnt really expect this to work so well for turning breech babies, but the statistics suggested it may work, and it was cheap so, why not?  Well Eastern medicine wins this round.  It actually turned my baby the FIRST night I did it to my wife.  We had an ultra sound coincidentally the following day to confirm, but almost immediately after doing this technique to my wife for around 25 minutes, she started to complain that the baby was twisting and hurting her.  The next day we found out why.  The baby turned that night.  I didnt even use half of the stick, and ever since the first night, our baby has stayed vertex.  My baby girl should be here any day now!  (sure it could have been coincidence, but what are the chances the baby turns on its own at the same time you finish a treatment?)</li>
    <li> this acuzone smokeless moxa rolls are great instead of acupuncture!!! i used them for my kidneys and are of great quality ! thank you</li>
    <li> Soo, I used the regular moxa and had to stop because my family has respiratory issues!! This one is smokeless.. That is if you can ever get it lit! Spend about 20 mins trying!! Does not get as hot as the traditional moxa either! Leaves a black residue on finger because it&#x27;s not wrapped in anther hung like traditional moxa. I&#x27;m using it fibroids, traditional moxa was helping to shrink them and stop heavy bleeding. Hopefully this one will do the same job and not smokey up my house... That is if it can only light!!</li>
    <li> Very helpful for natural healing!! The smell is therapeutic.</li>
    <li> So these were great because they were smokeless, and stayed lit for quite awhile. So it is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, they did not turn the baby. What did turn my breech baby was waiting until she was super active (around midnight), then sitting stick straight on the edge of a rocking chair, and rocking for 20 minutes. Boom, she turned, and she has stayed there ever since..</li>
