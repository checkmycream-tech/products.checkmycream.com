### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best.</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m happy that this product does what it says.</li>
      <li>Good service by the dealer.</li>
      <li>need more time to rate item.</li>
      <li>there has to be a better solution...</li>
      <li>Im not so sure what to say about this product.  </li>
      <li>I will have to do some more research before I try another product.</li>
      <li>I am sure in time</li>
      <li>I could say more.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;So cannot feel that it has been a worthwhile purchase.</li>
      <li>I will say that it smells really nice and fresh, so I enjoy putting it</li>
      <li>This was a HUGE discouragement .</li>
      <li>the company takes out their shipping charges when you return it even if original shipping was &#x27;free&#x27;).  </li>
      <li>I searched far and wide and found this website to have the greatest bargain on this product.</li>
      <li>and I thought the product was worth trying</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a change in  my spots...</li>
      <li>it really didn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
      <li>I used this faithfully 3-4 times per day for 7 weeks (much more frequently for the last 3 weeks) and it did absolutely nothing at all.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Was really hoping it would work.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I followed the directions to the letter, applying the so called remedy 2-3 times a day for over 6 weeks, (claims results in 2 or as much as 4 weeks), Nothing happened,</li>
      <li>Had trouble with the ball on the top.</li>
      <li>The smell is strong and it stings just a little.  </li>
      <li>NO color change at all!&lt;br /&gt;It bothers me in greatly to have these ugly things all over my legs, so, if you have a large number of these or some &amp;#34;larger size&amp;#34; Cherry Angiomas, (like me) , don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this snake oil.</li>
      <li>i ordered from naturasil directly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it and may be surprised if it ends up working.</li>
      <li>Kind of a rip-off</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fast shipping.  I read other comments.  Should have listened.  I have been using for a while.. NO change.  Was really hoping it would work.</li>
    <li> This product smells really bad so you can&#x27;t use it and then go to work because you smell it along with everyone else. Embarrasing!! plus it says to use it 3-4 times a day...again you canif you want to smell like that. I can&#x27;t even describe how horrible it smells. The TAG REMOVER one smells even worse. I&#x27;m going to find something else.</li>
    <li> I used this faithfully 3-4 times per day for 7 weeks (much more frequently for the last 3 weeks) and it did absolutely nothing at all.  Just a waste of time and money (not only did i have to pay return shipping, but the company takes out their shipping charges when you return it even if original shipping was &#x27;free&#x27;).  i ordered from naturasil directly.  although i was very unhappy with product, they did refund quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months with no results.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a change in  my spots...there has to be a better solution...I have had laser treatments on some of the larger Cherries and they dispersed almost instantly...and haven&#x27;t come back...</li>
    <li> Im not so sure what to say about this product.  I hope it works.  I use it twice a day after showering and before bed.  The smell is strong and it stings just a little.  I am sure in time I could say more.  Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
    <li> It is work but take too long to remove red spot. The volume is very little and took me six bottles already.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any results from this product.&lt;br /&gt;So cannot feel that it has been a worthwhile purchase.</li>
    <li> Save your money it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The problem with this product is it needs to be applied 4 times daily for 3-4 months to work.  Just can&#x27;t seem to remember to use it that often.  Good service by the dealer.</li>
    <li> I never got to try it out as the bottle arrived empty.</li>
    <li> I have not had this item for to long.  I need to use it for at least 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;I need more time to rate item.</li>
    <li> I use this product every week. I place it on the spot every day in the morning after my shower. Sometimes I use it on the weekends too. After a month, the spot never changed color at all. I tried to get my money back after 6 + weeks, but the company said it had been too long. Kind of a rip-off considering you have to use it for a while to get results. I will say that it smells really nice and fresh, so I enjoy putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would lighten my red mole though, as they claim it will do. I will continue using it, maybe in time it will work.</li>
    <li> The product states that you will see results in two to four weeks.  I&#x27;m on week three and haven&#x27;t seen any signs of improvement.  I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product twice and I see little or no improvement in the angiomas on my neck or chest.  Also, one of the bottles in the double pack was cracked and half the liquid spilled out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as directed, but it hasn&#x27;t made any difference.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and may be surprised if it ends up working.</li>
    <li> It is an expensive product and does not work at all. I had laser treatment and in less than a week, they were gone.</li>
    <li> it really didn&#x27;t do the job.  I still have the same cherry angiomas as before the treatment.  would not use it again.</li>
    <li> I bought Cherry Angioma removal by Naturasil several months ago and used it 3 times per day for 8 weeks and it did nothing to remove the cherry angiomas.  I was diagnosed with cherry angiomas by a dermatologist and I thought the product was worth trying but it was a waste of money.  I waited too long and now the 90 day time period for your money back is over.  I attempted to post a review of the product on the Naturasil website but they did not show it, I guess because it wasn&#x27;t favorable.  [[ASIN:B0074K4NFC Naturasil for Cherry Angiomas]]</li>
    <li> Used every day several times and nothing happened. Very disappointed that nothing changed with my spots. Wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> Had trouble with the ball on the top. So every time I had to use it I needed to remove the ball and use the tip of my finger and put it on the angiomas. I did not see any change in the angiomas at all.  i would not recommend it, and would not order again.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Thanks</li>
    <li> Im not sure it works but I continue to use it hoping it will</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical that this would actually make my cherry angioma go away, but after using it 3 times a day for 3 weeks it actually did the job!  I don&#x27;t know if stopping application will make it come back because I am continuing to use it twice a day (it&#x27;s been a couple of months now) but I&#x27;m happy that this product does what it says.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to the letter, applying the so called remedy 2-3 times a day for over 6 weeks, (claims results in 2 or as much as 4 weeks), Nothing happened, NO color change at all!&lt;br /&gt;It bothers me in greatly to have these ugly things all over my legs, so, if you have a large number of these or some &amp;#34;larger size&amp;#34; Cherry Angiomas, (like me) , don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this snake oil. I will have to do some more research before I try another product. This was a HUGE discouragement .</li>
    <li> I searched far and wide and found this website to have the greatest bargain on this product. I would recommend this to others.</li>
