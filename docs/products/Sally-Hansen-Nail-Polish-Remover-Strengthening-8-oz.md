    <li> My nails feel like steel after I put this polish remover/nail strengthener on. It&#x27;s kinda scary how strong it is... It also works very well in removing nail polish.</li>

    <li> I love this nail polish remover, but I hate the smell. It always gives me a migraine. Don&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re suffering from a headache or on a hot day.

    <li> I ran out of nail polish remover and I just needed some that wasn&#x27;t too expensive. This seemed like a good deal. I ended up liking it better than my old brand I used to buy.

    <li> This arrived today with no seal on bottle. One-third of product was missing.&lt;br /&gt;No way am I putting this on my body. I have no idea if this is the real product.&lt;br /&gt;Bucks wasted.</li>
