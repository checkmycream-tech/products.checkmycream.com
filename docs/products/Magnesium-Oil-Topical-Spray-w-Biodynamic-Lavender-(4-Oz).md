<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This oil has many uses. I won&#x27;t repeat other reviewers except to say great for joint pain and skin.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it enough to give a good review.</li>
    <li> Makes skin a bit itchy and bothered when I&#x27;m deficient, I know cause when I take supplements orally and use this there&#x27;s no itching but when I haven&#x27;t used this or pill in a few days it makes some itching.. Think it&#x27;s working to get my mag. Smells good not strong</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have used it on my own cramps and tight muscles and it greatly improves the soreness.  But, I also use it on track athletes that I coach.  They are back to practice much quicker and say that it helps them to feel better almost instantly.  Definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Love getting magnesium thru the skin.  This is a little sticky--not bad due to the addition of the essential oils</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare this product to.  I wanted a spray Magnesium and I bought this because it had 5 stars, was on Prime, and had organic ingredients.  I find that I sleep better,  have fewer headaches and generally feel better.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that thy listed how much you can use it every day - I just spray it on whenever I feel like it..  Not very scientific.</li>
    <li> spray pump is cheap. it quit working after like two pumps. i thought i did a review on this before... guess not.</li>
    <li> Was hoping that it would help make my skin healthier but I had a bad reaction to it...stopped using it and most definitely wont buy again. It doesn&#x27;t have a recommended amount to apply either...so somewhat misleading.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. Really helped leg and foot cramps</li>
    <li> This has really helped with my leg cramps. I rarely get them when using this spray.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the hope that it would help with my RLS. Within a week I began noticing the difference. I&#x27;m finally sleeping without pain.</li>
    <li> I ordered this specifically because it was supposed to come with the essential oils added. Amazon sent me a product without those oils and I was disappointed. I contacted Amazon and they refunded the purchase. They asked me to send the product back, but I told them the hassle of shipping it back wasn&#x27;t worth it. They gave me a refund anyway. Other than the absence of the essential oils, the product works as expected. I sleep better when I use it. I don&#x27;t know what you can do to get this with the essential oils, but if Amazon is fulfilling the order I would expect it to come without.</li>
    <li> My product arrived on time and everything but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it&#x27;s described.  I don&#x27;t believe there are any essential oils in this spray and I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this ever again.  Had I known it didn&#x27;t smell like described, I would&#x27;ve ordered a different magnesium oil and just added the essentials myself.&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned!</li>
    <li> I think a lot of topical Mg has a funky smell.. this one smells great! Helps put me to sleep, too, and I skip all the messy side effects that oral Mg has.</li>
    <li> seems to be helping with muscle aches and pains</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the oil or the massaging in of the oil, but I seem to get  mild, temporary relief.</li>
    <li> Arrived not screwed on tightly and spilled all over my other orders... I ended up trying what was left and found it to be of poor quality and very weak/ possibly diluted. There are definitely more effective ones available here on amazon</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. When I received it, my left wrist and the fingers on my right hand ached from computer usage. I sprayed both of my hands and wrists. There was very little burning that lasted just a few seconds anyway and about fifteen minutes later I had forgotten everything. All pain had dissipated. I also sprayed some on a friend&#x27;s back since he was in quite a bit of pain. He called the next day to ask me what it was. He was able to get out of his bed the next day with minimal pain. (He was skeptical and showered 30 mins after I sprayed him). I will buy the ebook on all the benefits to the product.</li>
    <li> I have os arthritis in my knees. I sprayed and rubbed it in. I was able to stand and do a few things without pain. I like to spray it on at night so I don&#x27;t have to struggle walking when I get out of bed. I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Helps with pain so quickly.</li>
    <li> I think I may be allergic to some of the ingredients. Not a success for me.</li>
    <li> So tired of putting chemicals on my body so I decided to trust and give this one a try.  I AM SOOOOO happy I did!  It&#x27;s nothing short of miraculous!  You really deserve to try this and give your body a break from harsh chemicals.  LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with my knee for quite some time.  X-rays never showed anything so I thought I would just have to live with the pain.  Sometimes it was so bad it was very difficult to walk.  I started rubbing this spray on my knee twice a day, once in the morning and again before bed.  I can honestly tell you now, after a few weeks, my knee is pain free.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of voodoo this is but it works!!</li>
    <li> Nice product...I am fortunate in not having skin irritation with magnesium oil.  I like the added oils and have offered it to friends with sensitivity to the magnesium oil.  The oils seem to help their skin not object to the application of this product.</li>
    <li> wonderful product! this is the 3 bottle of mag oil i have ordered and used. it is waaaay better than any of the others. i am seeing omica organics puts out superior products! this does not burn, sting, or cause any irritation. i spray on shoulders, neck, soles of feet and feel better instantly! thank you</li>
    <li> THIS OIL HELPS SO MUCH ..I DO HEAVY DUTY GARDENING AND HAVE ACHING NECK AND BACK ..I ALSO HAVE TROULBE FALLING ASLEEP EVEN THOUGHT I AM EXHAUSTED ...AND I JUST SPRAY A LITTTLE OF THIS OIL ON MY NECK AND BACK AND FALL INTO A DEEP WONDERFUL SLEEEP</li>
    <li> This is so good...i spray it on my shoulder when i was hurt in an accident &amp; this really helped me...I would buy it again thank you!!</li>
    <li> This product is great for sore muscles and a good way to absorb magnesium if you are deficient!  Very good product!</li>
    <li> No aroma and doesn&#x27;t diminish my restless legs syndrome.  Used for one week . . . . a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Since I am a believer of the miracle of magnesium, the oil spray will give an additional boost while busy doing something else</li>
    <li> not convinced there was any lavender in it.  not impressed.  is in the bin</li>
    <li> I have aches in my knees and hips from many years of walking on concrete , use this daily and I promise you will notice a difference for the better!</li>
    <li> but there&#x27;s no question I&#x27;m recovering my legs after intense endurance exercise a whole lot quicker since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It freaked me out at first because I felt a stinging sensation when I put it on, but there were no consequences and I&#x27;ve been bouncing back much better since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and an essential one for me moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> works really well it has soothed my pain</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really do the trick. I purchased this and another magnesium oil to try. I love lavender, but this didn&#x27;t have any kind of smell to it. I don&#x27;t know why, but I didn&#x27;t get the benefits from this oil as I did from the other one. I tried each one for a week (at night, I&#x27;ll spray it on my belly if I&#x27;m constipated or on my feet to help relax or elsewhere if I&#x27;m having muscle soreness) and when I used this one, it was like I was using nothing.</li>
