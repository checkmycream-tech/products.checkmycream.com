      <li>What is nice about this oil, it is not grease at all after applying it, it absorbs in the skin, but it feels really nice and soft, and also it takes my mascara and makeup off in no time.  </li>
      <li>however, after I kept using it, day after day it absorbed better as my skin got more used to it.</li>

      <li>The mix is excellent for removal of black spots on skin</li>

      <li>Have used it during and before pregnancy as it is so smooth and absorb any.  </li>
      <li>Look at the pic on the detailed description, it shows almond oil, which is what I received.</li>
      <li>Great carrier oil for your essential oils.</li>
      <li>Leaves it smooth and moist and chemical free</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light oil</li>

      <li>oil absorbs easily, and it spreads quickly.</li>
      <li>Sweet almond oil is a light, non-greasy carrier oil that is supposed to have NO smell.</li>
      <li>my skin is also much smoother and great for my sensitive skin ..</li>
      <li>I have so many oils from so many different companies because I make all of my own home, bath and body products so having a large stash of oils is super important.</li>
      <li>Basically 4 stars would have been for 100% oil and 5 stars for 100% pure oil plus organic :)</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the Sweet Almond smell, this is not what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was using another oil which was 100% sweet almond oil, I assumed this was 100%.</li>
      <li>I bought this sweet almond oil to help soothe my eczema in the winter.  </li>

      <li>oil\\&quot; to use after shower or bath to moisturizer skin but absorbs quickly and will not get on clothes.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s great for skin also) that is pretty reasonably priced for such a quality oil.</li>
      <li>Great for smoothing and softening winter dried skin.</li>
      <li>This oil is amazing to use daily with lotion.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a tad oiler than I thought it would be. I will use it in my home made hand soaps, though. There is no almond fragrance to this so if you want that, this wouldn&#x27;t be the item to buy.</li>
    <li> I use every single day for the last five years. Makes skin soft and gives a glow</li>
    <li> I use this almond oil as part of some of my DIY skin care recipes and it&#x27;s never failed me. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am giving this one star because, inexplicably, the bottle arrived without the cap, just the aluminum/paper seal over the top. Other than that, I like the oil and have used it for a long time. Arrived in 3 days.</li>
    <li> I am a convert.  Oil cleansing method works for me.  And this oil is versatile-beyond the face.  Pour a capful in the tub when my kids bathe and they come out clean and soft as silk.</li>
    <li> When viewing the product with other grape seed oil products, the description is grape seed oil, then when looking at the detailed description, the title is skin care oil and the product description is listed as grape seed oil, which is why I ordered it. Look at the pic on the detailed description, it shows almond oil, which is what I received. Your descriptions are totally wrong and I got the wrong product. I want grape seed oil.</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> The oil is nice for its price. I failed to read carefully, it is not 100% almond oil. I was using another oil which was 100% sweet almond oil, I assumed this was 100%. When I rub it into my hands it absorbs so quickly. My other brand was thicker and richer, a tiny bit went a long way. This oil seems lighter, not as heavy, takes more to have the same effect. There is a very light scent.  I use almond oil daily in the mornings on my face, sometimes body. In the evening I use grape-seed oil to go to bed. I use olive oil and a drop of tea tree oil within it on my body. All of my oils are edible,except for this almond oil for some reason, I buy them at \\&quot;Trader Joe&#x27;s\\&quot; in the section of cooking oils. This is an okay company, I will use it on my face but next time I will look for 100% oil. I give it 3 stars , and not 4 because its still pure, just not 100% and the price is decent compared to many other brands $10. It is also not organic so I did not give it 5 stars. Basically 4 stars would have been for 100% oil and 5 stars for 100% pure oil plus organic :)</li>
    <li> This skin oil is great. It leaves the skin moisturized without looking greasy at all. My husband and I like to use it as a massage oil and it feels great. The oil works great after a shower or bath to reduce the feeling of razor burn, and also works great as a hair oil to strengthen and moisturize dry hair. I will definitely be buying this again, maybe in 6 months once I finally use this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. It has no odor as far as my husband and I can tell.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I came across it through a friend, they are using it on their little one, and one day after a bath I applied it on him and my hands felt so soft I had to get it. What is nice about this oil, it is not grease at all after applying it, it absorbs in the skin, but it feels really nice and soft, and also it takes my mascara and makeup off in no time.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Even though it says \\&quot;Aromatherapy\\&quot; there is really no smell. I leave it in my shower and put it on while still damp. It is an oil, so you will feel a little greasy for about an hour, but it has worked wonders on my dry skin. I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This oil is very nourishing to the skin. I am in my late fifties with dry skin that has periodic episodes of eczema in the winter. This oil readily softens and protect my skin from the dry environment. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my pregnant wife. She seems to love it. Leaves her skin soft and moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> First off - there is a difference between sweet almond oil (a carrier oil, THIS) and almond essential oil (a completely different product which does smell like almonds). Sweet almond oil is a light, non-greasy carrier oil that is supposed to have NO smell. Which this one doesn&#x27;t, which is fine with me! I use this product mainly as a moisturizer serum. I have tried many different oils but I think I found the winner! I was using grapeseed oil but finally figured out it was too drying for my skin. The first night I used this I noticed it was sitting on top of my skin and not really absorbing well, and I started to get nervous...however, after I kept using it, day after day it absorbed better as my skin got more used to it. I have had zero breakouts, my skin tone is much more even, my skin is softer, and my acne scars are fading fast. It just feels good on your skin! This is a great, pure product (if you read the label, is does contain vitamin E oil but it&#x27;s great for skin also) that is pretty reasonably priced for such a quality oil. Yes, some people find the squirt lid to be a pain in the a$$, but I just buy the little 2oz amber glass droppers at Whole Foods and transfer it into there. Problem solved!</li>
    <li> This oil is very good.  The almond oil takes a little longer to absorb.  I use this one at night time and the grape seed one in the morning.  Both are awesome product.</li>
    <li> love this oil, use it daily with few drops of essential oils on my baby&#x27;s buttock. no rush, no skin reactions, natural product</li>
    <li> We use carrier oils and essential oils often.  This sweet almond oil is great.  I love that it does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> Love to use it in my bath.</li>
    <li> I add this to my baby wipe solution for our reusable cloth wipes. It&#x27;s mostly water, a tiny bit of castile soap, and natural oils. My baby&#x27;s bottom is smooth and we&#x27;ve never had any irritation!</li>
    <li> Ugghh I love Almond Oil. I have so many oils from so many different companies because I make all of my own home, bath and body products so having a large stash of oils is super important. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the sweet almond oil; used for making homemade scrubs and eye makeup removers to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> Use everyday - it is my face moisture treatment.  Not too greasy, low odor if any, dries quickly,.</li>
    <li> its the oil i was looking for my baby for massage. its smooth and non greasy, absorb in few minutes.its made of sweet almond oil so i prefered it over mineral baby oil(johnson)i loved it.</li>
    <li> I love this product but the at least 2 ounces of oil had seeped out of the top of the bottle in transport.  It needs to be packaged better.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin oil I have ever used!  My old regimen was jojoba mixed with tea tree and/or lavender, which didn&#x27;t clog my pores but was still pretty greasy.  Almond oil provided all the benefits of jojoba without the heavy residue.  I use it right out of the shower while my skin is still damp -- a little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts quite a while.  The oil works well on the body and the face; it&#x27;s light, odorless, and an excellent moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve had no trouble with breakouts or flaky skin since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is perfect to put on after a shower and doesn&#x27;t make you feel super greasy or breakout after putting on.</li>
    <li> I use this as part of my safety razor shaving ritual, in that I put oil on my face after heating it up, then put the shave cream on over that.  The razor glides over the skin far easier and far safer than without.</li>
    <li> Great for a carrier oil!</li>
    <li> My husband has Pityrialis Rubra Pilaris. He is using Aura Cacia Sweet Almond oil to lubricate his face, ears and hair. It is a a nice product for this purpose and is quickly absorbed into his skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this sweet almond oil to help soothe my eczema in the winter.  I figured I would go with the Aura Cacia brand since I already use their argan oil for my hair which I absolutely love.  I have only been using it for two days but I have already noticed how soft it leaves my skin feeling.  It&#x27;s a light oil so when you apply it, it does not leave your skin with a greasy feel to it which I truly appreciate.  I use it for my body and face since it has vitamin E in it and just applu it directly out of the shower.  Some other reviews from this product said to be weary of the top which pours the oil out rapidls and since I tend to be heavy handed I transferred the oil to a smaller bottle since I bought the 16 oz. and I am refrigerating the rest so it doesn&#x27;t go bad.  But remember since it is a light oil, less is more so don&#x27;t overuse it because you don&#x27;t think you put on enough.</li>
    <li> I use this along with sunscreen. I love how it looks and hydrates.</li>
    <li> Almond oil is great for the face, the body and in foods or blended with essential oils for various uses, including fragrance oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almond oil is light, absorbs well and has a fragrance all its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aura Cacia products have been around a long time, just like me.  And I have been a user of Aura Cacia products since in age 19, that a long time as I am now 64.  Aura Cacia has always been of consistantly good quality in all products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.com.  This was a wonderful purchase from an Amazon.com vendor.  Good and safe shipping, also.</li>
    <li> I use this every day every where. Its so rich and keeps dry winter skin feeling nourished. I use it on my face.  It removes makeup in a flash.</li>
    <li> Oil is very thick and if you put it on after showering, while wet, then dry yourself, the towel will get icky and unusable in no time.</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing to use daily with lotion.  Have used it during and before pregnancy as it is so smooth and absorb any.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for all types of skin. We use this for our 3yr angel and must say have no complaints!!</li>
    <li> the best oil and at a good price! very good for dry skin</li>
    <li> Unbelievable that&#x27;s what my husband said of this oil. He uses deep tissue massage on me for relief from fibromyalgia pain in my muscles.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a couple of drops because it is so thick. We have used all kinds of different oils. This is the best. I have very, very dry skin &amp; yet it still takes very little compared to all other oils tried. Very moisturizing too.</li>
    <li> I got this for all over use.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well to moisturize my hair as coconut oil and my scalp did not like this.  However, it has worked very well everywhere else!  No lotion I&#x27;ve ever had, has worked as well on my feet.  I was so surprised because my heels can be so tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this twice a day on my body and at night on my face.  I am pleased with that.  I also used this on my nose when I got a bad cold and it was a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a scent and it does feel a little greasy (since is an oil) but not that bad.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law likes it and she is hard to please.  I will probably purchase it again this year if she is looking for skin stuff</li>
    <li> Not sticky! Great on skin.. Even on baby&#x27;s skin. Leaves it smooth and moist and chemical free Thank y ou</li>
    <li> kind of expensive, but feels nice.</li>
    <li> I started to see the aging underneath my eye area I swear after a week i already see the difference..my skin is also much smoother and great for my sensitive skin ..no break outs</li>
    <li> Any high quality oil should be preferably Expeller-Pressed with no added additives of any sort, in a dark glass container, unfiltered, raw, USDA certified organic. The AO in this container is hardly any of those and furthermore it comes with added supplement E when it is not the greatest thing externally but it is internally only sourced from healthy food ingredient like WGO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been looking for a lotion (which is liquid) not a cream (which is solid) for external use, for hands during winter, face after shaving, feet for white dry skin, and for the entire body after hours and hours of mountain biking and surfing in burning sun for years and years. After shaving regardless wherever on your body, you are not suppose to use cream since it is solid. It blocks the pores of the skin from breathing. You are suppose to use a lotion. AO, CO and VCO are the best for my entire body since all are easily absorbed and won&#x27;t clog pores. Oils need to be food grade which means you should be able to cook with it, consume it directly for internal use just like EVOO and when applied to the skin, it should be virtually odorless. Any oil from any nut or seed will go rancid in less than six months so purchasing huge amount of oil will have no nutritional value shortly after production. I refill my very smaller container mixed with different oils in my bathroom drawer next to my shaving blade which is dark, away from any light, moisture, air and heat. I keep the rest in the freezer. The mix is excellent for removal of black spots on skin especially the big scabs I get from mountain biking, burned skin, massage, headache and much more.</li>
    <li> Great Product and consistent quality. I&#x27;ve used this product for years and purchased it in stores before.  Now that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon - it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the way this makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Aura Cacia products. High quality at a great price. THANKS!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a few months now.  Although I don&#x27;t use it daily, whenever I do use it, I see a huge difference in my skin!  It absorbs well and my skin looks so much younger!  It has a nice, light scent too.  Overall, I highly recommend this product...I use it on my body and on my face.</li>
    <li> I received this product as promised and I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> The product seems fine for now, but some of the oil leaked in the box in shipping. There was an &amp;#34;intact&amp;#34; seal in place under the lid but the product leaks through the seal.  There is no expiration date on the package. With the compromised seal I wonder what my shelf life will end up being.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it on my legs every day after showering, and no longer have dry skin. I will say though, that they certainly jacked up the price. I started buying it on Amazon a couple of years ago because the price was so competitive, but now it costs as much as it does at Whole Foods! I guess I&#x27;ll go back to buying it there.</li>
    <li> Holy grail product for all purpose use. My whole family uses it ( my 2 nieces, sister, mother, father, husband, me). I have introduced this product recently to my husband and he said he saw a big diffrence in the hair growth and the skin. We all love it. I think we bought like 35- 40 bottles (16oz) all together in 4 yrs. Aura cacia  thank you for the good standard of the product.</li>
    <li> Great to towel all over after shower. Use in place of foot creme.</li>
    <li> Great value! I use this to make fragrant body oils....just mix with essential oils and you&#x27;ve got a high quality moisturizer that would be far more costly to buy. I transfer this to a glass pump bottle and it gives me 4-5 full bottles. The Sweet Almond oil is nurturing and very moisturizing without being to greasy. Just use after bath or shower and you&#x27;ll see how soft your skin can be!</li>
    <li> Natural and soothing!</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews and I ordered it for my skin face that becomes dry. I use it for 3 days in the evening - I have to rub a lot until my face is not greasy any more and the skin doesn&#x27;t improve after that. I&#x27;m very disappointed. The bottle is big, I don&#x27;t know if I can use this oil on my body because I hate to be greasy. Maybe for other people it works, but not for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect moisturizing \\&quot;dry oil\\&quot; to use after shower or bath to moisturizer skin but absorbs quickly and will not get on clothes. To me it is unscented which I also like.</li>
    <li> Works remarkably well.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for my Body Butter - I accidentally posted negative from another product on this product - but the sweet almond oil was excellent!</li>
    <li> I thought for sure that using this oil on my face would make me break out, but the Minnesota winters are so harsh on my 46 year-old skin, I&#x27;ve tried practically everything, so after I saw a review of this product saying another person used it on her face, I thought I would give it a try since it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.  I had been looking for an anti-aging face cream that doesn&#x27;t have parabens (since parabens have been shown to be associated with breast cancer).  To cut to the chase, this product is fantastic!!!  I put it on my legs and arms, and when my hands still have a little oil left on them, I rub it into my face.  After only a week, my face seems noticeably softer, less dry, and even less wrinkled.  I sure wish I had all the money back that I&#x27;ve spent on expensive creams and lotions that didn&#x27;t really do anything -- who knew that this twelve-dollar product would be all I would need?</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for your essential oils.</li>
    <li> I have a 5month old and have been usign this for his massage since he was 3 weeks old.&lt;br /&gt;I like it</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, so I use this oil everyday. As it is just almond oil and vitamin E, it does not choke my pores or cause ingrown hairs as products with paraffin or other waxes are likely to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil absorbs easily, and it spreads quickly. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> There is very little sent, which I like.  Its a bit oily but my skin is dry and I like this also.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil hoping it would really smell nice, but all it smells like is cooking oil!!  Who wants to smell like a that?!</li>
    <li> NOTE TO POTENTIAL BUYERS: This is non-scented product. If you&#x27;re looking for the Sweet Almond smell, this is not what you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for skin moisturization in dry environments though, large volume makes it a good investment for long-term skin care.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my skin during pregnancy through the winter months, and it kept my skin healthy and hydrated. I mostly used it on my belly to keep it moisturized to help prevent stretch marks. It must have helped, because I didn&#x27;t get any. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Such a great price on this!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and dermitias.  It soothes my itchy skin. I have been using this for years.  First learned of almond oil from a book I read by a yogi written in the 60&#x27;s.  She was Indian and trained since she was 9 years old and married a diplomat. &amp;#34;Taught all the Wa DC ladies yoga in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.  Wish I could remember her name.  She said almond oil is the only moisturer you need.</li>
    <li> This is a good supplement to your regular skin care lotion.  Skin feels great!  Mix a couple of drops with your regular lotion.</li>
    <li> Great for my skin and hair.  Not to greasy and amazingly does not weigh my hair down. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I just love the almond oil it makes  my skin feel nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I have read some of the other reviews, and they must have had a good nose. I have smelled mine when I had gotten it and was very disappointed it had no smell, I had to buy a scent to add to it.</li>
    <li> Watched a video on Youtube and bought it. I used the oil with shea butter for 2 weeks and the foot looks better now.</li>
    <li> Sweet almond oil is one of my favorite skin care oils.This brand of oil is known for its quality. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. A great oil without the unhealthy extras.</li>
    <li> Great for smoothing and softening winter dried skin. Used just once a day after shower. Definitely recommend to control dryness.</li>
    <li> pediatrician recommended me to use non scented baby oil for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine told me about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Great oil for baby massage.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase in amazon.</li>
    <li> I add a full bottle of my favorite essential oil (currently Aura Cacia Sweet Orange) to this, and apply every day after my shower while I am still wet.  This provides wonderful natural moisturization all day long!</li>
