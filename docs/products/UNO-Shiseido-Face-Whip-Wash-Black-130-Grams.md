      <li>love it.</li>

      <li>I love this face wash.</li>
      <li>Naturgo is a bit rougher than Shiseido, but it cleans much better than Shiseido.</li>
      <li>The best thing is the scent is unisex, leaves your face fresh and clean (really removes the dirt in your pores), and foams up really nice.</li>
      <li>This is actually a pretty good face wash.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin clean , fresh and nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think you will be very happy with the Black Wash.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I have seen a huge change in the condition of my skin (yet)</li>
      <li>It has light tingling sensation which isnt over powering.</li>
      <li>This facial cleaner is absolutely the best!!</li>
      <li>I like this cleanser, it does clean well.</li>
      <li>but I can feel it clean my skin.</li>
      <li>but I must say that this makes my face feel SO clean.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>Its strong, oil-absorbent and oil-sucking properties work great for oily, acneic skin--but on my dehydrated skin, it caused flaking and excessive tightness.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 years now and it just keeps doing amazing job at removing the extra oil I have in my T-zone</li>
      <li>I will go back to \\&quot;Naturgo Men&#x27;s Clay\\&quot;, it seems to clean better and has scrubbing beads.</li>
      <li>Shiseido is not a bad cleanser, but why would you pay so much for it.</li>
      <li>Not only does it make your skin look fantastic, but it also makes your skin feel fantastic.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to see more improvement in my acne, no such luck.</li>
      <li>First, I used a make up remover cloth all over my face to remove my mascara, eye shadow, foundation and lip stick.</li>
      <li>After a long day, This makes my skin feel very clean.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>After massaging it in very well, i then let is sit for about a minute and let the charcoal and other ingredients really do its magic.</li>
      <li>this black product is better than orange one.</li>
      <li>But be careful, it is strong.</li>
      <li>The price is way too high though.</li>
      <li>Moist 130g]], which has the same high-lathering properties but is more gentle for normal and dry skins.</li>
      <li>I rinsed my face and patted it dry with a clean towel.</li>
      <li>However, I must remember to moisturize my skin after I wash it so that it doesn&#x27;t get dried out and produce more oil.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite wash, my face did not feel dry the next morning although I did use a moisturizer after cleansing.</li>
      <li>and i buy a new one</li>
      <li>I had my doughs since I&#x27;m Mediterranean and was not sure it would work on my oily mix skin , but it did , I love it.</li>
      <li>The package threw me off at first because all the writing is in Japanese.</li>
      <li>One bottle of Shiseido will last more than half a year, and I use a penny size squeeze about 1-2 times a day.</li>
      <li>not harsh on skin and can use everyday.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face felt clean, refreshed and still a little tingly.</li>
      <li>Shiseido will help keep your face clean without being harsh.</li>
      <li>I broke into smaller pieces and began massaging it on my cheeks, chin and nose area, Lightly massaging in a circular motion, the wash slowly began to break down and become creamy with light suds on my face.</li>
      <li>No worries there cause the other reviews on the product is why I decided to purchase it in the first place.</li>
      <li>I then wet my face with cool water and opened the Black Wash which has a a very thick consistency, more product came out</li>
      <li>This wash makes my face feel so much cleaner than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Does not dry it out.</li>
      <li>I suffer from major breakouts and this wash has actually helped a lot!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have the old dry face feeling anymore.</li>
      <li>My face will naturally re-moisturize itself after cleansing if the weather is not too dry.</li>
      <li>This can be good and bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super good product. My BF like it too!</li>
    <li> It comes out very smooth and creamy and does a great job at stripping the skin of oil.  This can be good and bad.  After a long day, This makes my skin feel very clean. However, I must remember to moisturize my skin after I wash it so that it doesn&#x27;t get dried out and produce more oil. I would consider purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> It is good just as described on the we page. Very good ability to clean up your face. But be careful, it is strong. You only need to use it once a day.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for a few days. I can&#x27;t say that I have seen a huge change in the condition of my skin (yet) but I must say that this makes my face feel SO clean. You should know what I am talking about. Acne skin often feels &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;. This wash makes my face feel so much cleaner than any other product I&#x27;ve used. That alone is great.</li>
    <li> After using it a few weeks, hasn&#x27;t made my acne disappear but I can feel it clean my skin. I like it.</li>
    <li> this is not shisheido - don&#x27;t waste your $$ - and the whole package is written in japanese so I have no clue the ingredients. Not putting on my face.  Returning.</li>
    <li> Purchased this about 2 months ago while traveling to Japan . I had my doughs since I&#x27;m Mediterranean and was not sure it would work on my oily mix skin , but it did , I love it. Leaves skin clean , fresh and nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars as I would like to buy in store rather then pay for shipping . Also the price in Japan was 1/3.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing my spouse and I use now. The best thing is the scent is unisex, leaves your face fresh and clean (really removes the dirt in your pores), and foams up really nice. Especially for those who either has a t-zone or just an oily face, I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> its difficult to get from walmart, they dont sell japanese brands, price is good, quality is also good, i will come again</li>
    <li> This is actually a pretty good face wash. I suffer from major breakouts and this wash has actually helped a lot!</li>
    <li> I like this cleanser, it does clean well. I was hoping to see more improvement in my acne, no such luck. It does irritate the eyes though.</li>
    <li> great! best facial wash ever! love it. lost one in the airport and i buy a new one immediately lol</li>
    <li> The longer you leave it, the deeper it cleans...&lt;br /&gt;Is not harsh on skin and can use everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> It gives you a slight exfoliation without being too over bearing on the skin. I don&#x27;t have the old dry face feeling anymore.</li>
    <li> Shiseido will help keep your face clean without being harsh. I have no side-effects or reactions whatsoever. My face will naturally re-moisturize itself after cleansing if the weather is not too dry. The price is way too high though. I will go back to \\&quot;Naturgo Men&#x27;s Clay\\&quot;, it seems to clean better and has scrubbing beads. Naturgo is a bit rougher than Shiseido, but it cleans much better than Shiseido. Naturgo is also less expensive at $9, but it only cost $5-6 where I live. One bottle of Shiseido will last more than half a year, and I use a penny size squeeze about 1-2 times a day. Shiseido is not a bad cleanser, but why would you pay so much for it.</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed.  Does not dry it out.</li>
    <li> Umm, I didn&#x27;t see any results. Not only that, I noticed it was made in Vietnam. I thought this was a Japanese product?</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 years now and it just keeps doing amazing job at removing the extra oil I have in my T-zone</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin, this cleanser will only exacerbate the dryness. Its strong, oil-absorbent and oil-sucking properties work great for oily, acneic skin--but on my dehydrated skin, it caused flaking and excessive tightness. Instead try the white tube, [[ASIN:B00CQ8ZKVI Shiseido Uno Whip Wash Moist 130g]], which has the same high-lathering properties but is more gentle for normal and dry skins.</li>
    <li> Quite good ! I love it !</li>
    <li> i bought it for my friend. my friend thinks it is good. this black product is better than orange one.</li>
    <li> Always quality products with shiseido. Never using anything else</li>
    <li> Good oil control face wash!</li>
    <li> After gaining this thing, I think it&#x27;s beautiful.Details of what, all processing is very good.Value for money, I&#x27;ll buy such similar miku figure</li>
    <li> This facial cleaner is absolutely the best!! Not only does it make your skin look fantastic, but it also makes your skin feel fantastic. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A week of using this dried out my skin and made it break out. I switched back to the expensive Shiseido brand I get at te department store.</li>
    <li> This review is based on one use of the product. The package threw me off at first because all the writing is in Japanese. No worries there cause the other reviews on the product is why I decided to purchase it in the first place. First, I used a make up remover cloth all over my face to remove my mascara, eye shadow, foundation and lip stick. I then wet my face with cool water and opened the Black Wash which has a a very thick consistency, more product came out then I wanted to so I made a note to self for my next use. I broke into smaller pieces and began massaging it on my cheeks, chin and nose area, Lightly massaging in a circular motion, the wash slowly began to break down and become creamy with light suds on my face. I then worked it in on my forehead in the same circular motion. I really worked the product into my skin for a few minutes really focusing on my problem ares which lately have been my cheeks and chin due to my moon cycle. After massaging it in very well, i then let is sit for about a minute and let the charcoal and other ingredients really do its magic. It has light tingling sensation which isnt over powering. I rinsed my face and patted it dry with a clean towel. My face felt clean, refreshed and still a little tingly. This is my new favorite wash, my face did not feel dry the next morning although I did use a moisturizer after cleansing. If you have acne prone, oily skin like me I think you will be very happy with the Black Wash.</li>
