<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great item, arrived earlier than expected, had no issues with the order.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I was a bit worried about the scent/taste when I first ordered simply for the fact that it treats things like &amp;#34;gravel rash&amp;#34;, but I was pleasantly surprised. To me, it smells like a peaches and cream sort of scent, and it tastes a lot like plain Vaseline. But it works SO well. Very moisturizing and works well on patches of dry skin and even as a stretching lubricant for tapers. Came about a week before the ETA, and I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a moisturizer for my very dry cuticles, hands and feet.  The product does not moisturize any better than any other drugstore moisturizer, and I would say that it is worse because it smells dreadful.  I have to hold my nose everytime I apply it.  Will not purchase again.  I would recommend glycosolid or yu-be products...they do a better job at moisturizing and they don&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> I use it on my heals everyday, it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps them from cracking and looking gross in the summer</li>
    <li> I first discovered Papaw Ointment when I went to Australia and brought back several tubes to the U.S. The Aussies use it as lip balm and I find it very effective for that purpose, among others. I also use it to keep my cuticles moisterized and as a replacement for Neosporin for cuts/rashes. My friends always ask me for my Aussie Wonder Ointment because it seems I use it for everything and it works!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a great ointment for just about everything, this is it.  It is fantastic on cuticles and chapped lips especially.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing for super super dry skin!</li>
    <li> love this! its a good ointment thing for skin/lips. been using it on everything. has a slightly funky smell though, but i could just be a bit picky</li>
    <li> This was introduced to me by a stylist on a shoot and it is terrific. I applied to my severely sunburned lips at night and it really helped. Wouldn&#x27;t use this during the day say, if you&#x27;re surfing as it has no SPF properties but for your day to day needs you can&#x27;t go wrong. There are a lot of imitation products out there, make sure you get the real deal.</li>
    <li> Amazing. It helped my dog&#x27;s rash and both my husband and I used it for cuts and scratches and it helped overnight. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased Lucas’ Papaw ointment on Feb 1. With Prime 2 day shipping, I received it on Feb 3 (came on time). It came in a zip bag. Well packed and protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My baby has Eczema since she was 4 months old (Now is 9 months). After her Eczema starts, I have tried the following moisturizers: Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby oil, Olive oil, SebaMed Baby Lotion, SebaMed Baby Cream, Cetaphil Skin Moisturizer (Formulated for Eczema), Eucerin Professional Repair Lotion, Eucerin Calming Crème, Eucerin Original Healing Repair Crème, Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Crème, Medela Tender Care Lanolin, Aquaphor Healing Ointment (Dry, Cracked, and Irritated Skin Protectant), Laroche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5, Organic Coconut oil, Eucerin Baby Eczema Crème, Aveeno Eczema Cream, Lucas Papaw Ointment, Raw Apothecary Unrefined Raw Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucas’ Papaw ointment is one of the moisturizers that I love and also helps my daughter&#x27;s Eczema, especially on the red bumps on her arms and the cracked open area on her leg joints. There were 3 red bumps on her left arms. I tried a lot of moisturizes for 2 months. After using the Lucas’ Papaw ointment, the red bumps cleared in about a week. As for the cracked area on my baby’s leg joints, the ointment is not able to make it completely healed but keeps the area moisturized and not get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to applying on my baby, I also tried this ointment on the corner of my mouth due to a blister. As long as I kept putting the ointment on, I didn’t feel any discomfort. The blister disappeared and healed in about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 25g tube on my first purchase. Love it!! Therefore, I got a 200g jar on my second purchase.</li>
    <li> Just a bunch of vaseline, I didn&#x27;t see what was so special, why the reviews were so high, or why Michelle Phan was so stoked about it at one point</li>
    <li> Lips were miserably parched and chapped after moving to NY in the dead of winter - this gem does wonders. It says you can rub this all over your body for cuts, burns, and wounds. Have yet to try that, but I think that&#x27;s my future.</li>
    <li> really soothes dry chapped skin</li>
    <li> I have been using it everywhere! I can not live without it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I use it on my lips &amp; eyes before bed. I am going to order the large size very soon!</li>
    <li> Worked wonders for my chapped lips and dry, winter skin. The only thing I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
    <li> It was good, but didn&#x27;t help my problem with my hands......but I&#x27;m sure it is good for others, just not my hands</li>
    <li> It has a texture similar to aquaphor. It has a minor smell, nothing overbearing but a fruit smell. I use a small amount on my lips and a little more on my mosquito bites. So far I have no itching and my lips feel better. Let&#x27;s see how it goes over a few weeks.  UPDATE 5/23/15 So I used it yesterday and only applied it 3 times. I started my day at 5:30 am and left for work within an hour. I applied it before I left the house and by midday, it still worked. Normally I have to re-apply VERY often. I applied it after lunch and after dinner. Also, it&#x27;s good for sore noses. My sister had a sore nose from the pollen and her constantly blowing and this helped her nose. This stuff Is AMAZING.  Update 8/15/15 So I&#x27;ve used this for a while. Mainly on my lips, I just wanted to let you know how it worked on boils. Boils are VERY hard to get rid of and I had a family member that had a boil that wasn&#x27;t quite ready yet. I put a dab of this on the boil and the next morning it was gone.#magic</li>
    <li> This works really well on really rough, dry spots.  I use it as more of a spot treatment than for large areas.  With that said, I found it works great on those rough callous areas on dog elbows.  It&#x27;s not something they can easily lick off because of the thickness of the product so just a few days treating those areas works wonders.</li>
    <li> It smells strange, but it goes on smoothly and keeps your lips/skin supple and moisturized.  And doesn&#x27;t run out quickly, either!</li>
    <li> I have cracked lips all the time; living in Phoenix doesn&#x27;t help. That is, until I tried pawpaw ointment. Glad to see that it is available in tubes now.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dry lips at nights.  I love the other balm that they make for skin and decided to try this product.  It is fantastic for lips and I would really highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My cousin lives in Australia and this winter she brought me one of these as a gift. It works absolutely fantastic and I can almost use it for any purposes. It cures my extremely dry lips in this horrible new England winter. It cures my dry hands. It helped my broken skin resulted from screeching. Last week I accidental burnt my arm with an egg cooker and applied some papaw ointment on my burnt skin. I thought it would take me a long while for the wound to recover like they did before, but this ointment made it recover much quicker than I imagined!</li>
    <li> My friend from Australia first introduced me to this when she came to visit. That tube she brought as a gift got used up, hence my Amazon purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use it on my lips and nowadays don&#x27;t use anything waxy on my lips any more. This stuff is soft and quickly absorbed. We also use it on minor cuts, sores, and acne. Whatever is in it, it works!</li>
    <li> I grew up in Australia and my family always had a tub of Lucas papaw ointment in the medicine kit. Plus its great for chapped lips</li>
    <li> I had been interested in trying papaw ointment for a while and it does not disappoint. I like natural and plant-based personal care products...well, this has fermented papaya extract but it is petroleum based. It&#x27;s very thick and sticky so it has staying power. It&#x27;s like a thicker petroleum jelly, which is nice because rose salve doesn&#x27;t have as much staying power. It smells a little weirdly fruity in the tube but the scent dissipates when you apply it. At least it has no artificial fragrance. I haven&#x27;t faced a situation yet where I can determine that this is a miracle product, but it seems to have enriched healing effects. I&#x27;ve mostly used it for razor burn &amp;amp; knicks; it does provide irritation relief. Overall I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re interested, it seems pricey at $10 per tube and it is maybe 3/4 filled-- but it&#x27;s so thick that you don&#x27;t need to use much and it will last you a long time. I don&#x27;t know if the fermented papaya makes a difference in papaya allergic reactions; I have seen reviews of people having allergic reactions to papaya extract in beauty products. If you may be at risk you could spot test or avoid altogether if you are surely allergic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip: There is a triangular seal on the tube and a matching triangular hole in the cap to twist it off. I didn&#x27;t notice and sloppily cut it off with a blade like an idiot. My father used to work in a factory that made plastic cosmetic tubes and said he had never seen a design like it (And he&#x27;s a nerd about tubes, he inspects tubes when we&#x27;re shopping at Target!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of early 2016 I have stopped using it on my lips because I get occasional rashes that I believe petrolatum contributes to. At this point it mostly sits with the lesser-used balms and salves in my cosmetic drawer. I wanted to like this more but haven&#x27;t had much of a need and/or have products that better suit me. I prefer mostly natural products. I recommend Badger balms for lips, The Body Shop for hand creams and Mario Badescu muscle oil for healing and scars.</li>
    <li> Love the texture...hydrating but not thick!  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I wish the hydration lasted a little longer!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my lips when not wearing makeup and overnight. I had been paying $$$ for a cosmeceutical. Happy!</li>
    <li> Mine was also half full, as another reviewer stated. It feels exactly like most petroleum jelly I have used. I&#x27;m honestly not sure the difference between the type this brand uses and Vaseline, however it does feel nice and helps with some itchy eczema spots. I may try to find the papaw ingredient elsewhere though in the future.</li>
    <li> It feels really good on chapped skin and the container is a great size when traveling</li>
    <li> I use it on my lip only and gotta say that this ointment is the best. It soften my lip for the whole day. It also make my lip shine as if I had put on some lip gloss. It made my lip look so soft and pretty. One of the downside is that the smell of it isn&#x27;t very nice but it didn&#x27;t really bother me since the product is so awesome!</li>
    <li> The product was as described, brand new, and works perfectly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Who says great things have to be expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A God given soothing paw paw ointment - derived from nature - some radiation oncology units recommend these to sooth burns. An affordable provision.  Packaged like your grandmother&#x27;s remedy but has some serious benefits - made accessible to all through its affordability at about $3-4 a tube. Goes a long way. Available also in a tub but for your average household use, a tube goes a long way. Use a little and spread it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works across a wide variety of applications - from sunburn, to the grazed knee, to insect bites right through to prevent/sooth radiation burns from treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend these to friends.</li>
    <li> I am SO glad I took a change of this product.  I had skin issues for years.  This is the only product that is clearing it up!  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Had a new, weird skin problem around my eye(dry and flaked constantly) and tried lots of things, but nothing helped. read something about this stuff being used for same, or similar problem, so i sent for it. worked in ONE application :)</li>
    <li> yet another dont believe the hype product. I do like the smell, but as far as effectiveness-it is so so. There are better, there are worse. I bought it with pretty high hopes for some eczema in my search for a more natural remedy, but the search continues.</li>
    <li> The only thing that truly helps my dry lips throughout Accutane</li>
    <li> I suffer from chapped lips and dry cuticles in the winter. I have been using it for several days and they both feel much better. Yes it is primarily petroleum jelly, but it is clinical strength and EU approved. The EU has much stronger standards than the US on beauty products (don&#x27;t even get me started on that). I use it at night just before going to bed. I would  recommend giving it a try. I think you&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this amazing ointment hasn&#x27;t come into my life before now.  It&#x27;s fermented papaw paste and it cures whatever ails your skin. It&#x27;s for lips, cuts, burns and sensitive skin.  I had a nasty razor burn in my bikini area and within hours the Lucas&#x27; Papaw soothed my skin back to pool worthy condition. Get it - you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know....&lt;br /&gt;I want to believe this has some magical property, but I&#x27;ve applied to chapped hands/lips/my son&#x27;s bum hoping it&#x27;d yield good results and have not noticed anything more than vaseline achieves.&lt;br /&gt;Would not re-order.</li>
    <li> I had higher hopes for this product. It&#x27;s not that moisturizing or nourishing. My lips don&#x27;t feel particularly different when I put it on at night &amp; wake up in the morning. For the money, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure it worked until i got a cut&lt;br /&gt;it works now my hole family uses&lt;br /&gt;it on every thing bites cuts&lt;br /&gt;any thing it really works</li>
    <li> Bought 2013: $22 ointment:    I heard a lot of great reviews about this product, so I decided to try it out myself. Evidently, it was actually what I was hoping for. The formula seems pretty basic and has an semi-non conventional texture (golden and somewhat spongey looking) that I&#x27;m use to when it comes to lip balms, but works better than the previous ones I had. It lasted on my lips for over 12 hours (note: I did put a generous amount, i.e. about 10mmx10mm chunk), and keep them fairly moist-looking for the rest of the day. -- Slightly longer lasting than Sugar&#x27;s lip balm.      EDITED Review:  Bought 2014: $11.74 ointment:    Bought this product from a DIFFERENT user for a cheaper cost (~$11, the price I paid for my old original cream was $22 from NaturalTreasures), and gave completely different results! Unlike the ointment I bought earlier (the $22 one), this one had a very diluted consistency. The original $22 one I bought was spongy and chunky, and was able to last throughout the whole day. This one did not! It was a lot more fluid / thin (much like vaseline), and required to me to reapply it multiple times a day (I live in cold climate area so my lips get dry/flaky often). Hence, my guess is that there is much less of the lip-protecting-solute to solution that was found it the original product, so now its dries faster! Quite disappointing, and not worth it. To avoid being gypped, I would not pay for this cheaper price, and just opt for the regular $22.</li>
    <li> This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve used, and the only one that had successfully treated my dry, pealing lips</li>
    <li> I love this ointment! I am a big fan of papaya in general. I am glad for finally getting it. Thank you Australia for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best product for dry lips.  After using every waxy drugstore lip balm or expensive $20 brand name, this is far beyond any other.  It is not sticky, and a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s also great for those little cuts on your chapped hands you get in the winter.  I love it!</li>
    <li> The best for lip!  I have a few laying around. Nice taste and super cute packaging. Most of all effective.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but worth the cost for cold winter chapped hands.  I love the natural ingredients.  I would buy again</li>
    <li> This is the best multi purpose ointment I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not too greasy and works wonders on minor skin irritations!</li>
    <li> I really love this product, especially during the winter. I ordered the small tube of Lucas pawpa to see what the hype was all about, I had to try it. It&#x27;s great on your hands, face and chapped lips a real multipurpose ointment. I must say that I&#x27;ll be pruchasing a large jar the next time. Great product..</li>
    <li> I bought the hype, thinking this would be a miracle salve. It&#x27;s essentially a tube of petroleum jelly, which you can get at any store for a third of the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my fingers were really cracking badly, especially both thumbs!  They would crack and bleed and be sore for days.  This Ointment helped the cracking pretty well.  I think I expected more based on the reviews I read.  It good... but I really hope there other ointments/creams that REALLY stop the cracking!</li>
    <li> Any miracle product is iffy for me so when I ordered this I expected it to be a wash. I put it on a couple burns and they healed over time just like burns do and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Until my trip to Japan. I developed a horrible rash on my neck that I get on occasion from severe anxiety and stress. I have a topical steroid my dermatologist prescribed and it takes about 2 weeks to clear it up, but I didn&#x27;t bring it along. I remembered that I had tucked this ointment into my bag and fished it out. I applied it after showers and before bed. And my rash was gone in THREE days. Literally. Two 1x3&amp;#34; strips of raised, red, itchy, flaky skin gone completely cleared up 3 days compared to at least 2 weeks with a topical steroid. I will never go without it ever again...</li>
    <li> Like most people I have used chapsticks or Burt&#x27;s Bees and they only work temporarily. When I used those products, my lips only felt moisturized for few hours but they did not heal my cracked, peeling and dry lips. I have had this problem over 2 years and I finally got tired of using chapsticks 5-10 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ointment is awesome. Within the first week, my lips are healed and I am not exaggerating. My lips stopped peeling and are moisturized even when I don’t use this ointment. I only use this 2-3 times a day and that’s enough to fix my lips. If you have dry, cracked or peeling lips, you have to try this. It has a very light but pleasant smell and it has no taste in my opinion. It is glossy as most lip products. I am a male and it doesn’t look too bad. Overall this is a great ointment that saved my lips.</li>
    <li> A very effective product. Thumbs up. A nice alternative to Aquaphor. As a vegan, I wanted something without animal products.</li>
    <li> we bought this for my son&#x27;s rashes, and it seems to work and help clear them or rather protect them from getting irritated and becoming a bigger problem. It&#x27;s very thick but comes easily out of the bottle. The only reason it got a 4 is because it kind of smells weird. Also it is a dark yellowish color, which some people don&#x27;t like but that doesn&#x27;t bother us. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I use it every night on my lips! Last year my lips were really dry, the skin on my lips were peeling off and they felt like… I don&#x27;t know how to put it but my lips were flat out crusty and dry. I got this product and my lips which were already full look great and I have to say they&#x27;re soft. Buy it if you need a lip care product you want to invest on, but not too much $$$. I love it so much! I&#x27;m halfway through mine already. I&#x27;ll buy the bigger one next time because I&#x27;ll be using this forever.</li>
    <li> I use this for almost everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a ski instructor in the winter, which means 8 hour days in freezing temps, sun, wind, and whatever else mother nature decides to throw. I use this on my wind burn, my chapped lips, if I have a blemish i use it, sunburns, road rash, Any season any reason I always go for this first.</li>
    <li> Great product to throw in my bag - good on minor cuts, scrapes, chaffed skin -all around multi use.  A must for travel</li>
    <li> There are plenty of reviews of this product, but I&#x27;d like to add a little something as pertains to eczema. Another reviewer commented that it didn&#x27;t help their eczema, but I&#x27;ve found it very good for an unfortunate aspect of the condition, which is broken skin caused by excessive scratching. Lucas&#x27; Papaw can be used on broken skin, and it is very good for treating red, open, possibly infected areas of eczema. Sorry to be gross, but that&#x27;s the way it is. It isn&#x27;t moisturizing, though it is gooey, so it doesn&#x27;t help with the dry red patches, but it is very good at treating and healing broken skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the smell-- to me, it smells slightly sweet and waxy. A bit like a papaya. It is barely noticeable, and not unpleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fellow eczema sufferers may want to check out my other reviews for products I&#x27;ve found helpful.</li>
    <li> My lips are so chapped all the time and nothing would heal them. A friend recommended this so I reluctantly ordered it thinking it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for me but this is the first product I&#x27;ve ever used on my lips to actually heal and soften them. I&#x27;m actually almost done from this little tube and will order soon. It lasted me a year.</li>
    <li> Useful item and quality</li>
    <li> Use it as a lip balm...it&#x27;s awesome and lasts forever</li>
    <li> Cleared up a rash as well overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. I mean if Scarlett Johansson uses it...&lt;br /&gt;she has great lips.</li>
    <li> Best for the lips!&lt;br /&gt;First product that really keeps my lips soft (mine are perpetually chapped, I&#x27;m outdoors a lot). Each application Lasts for long time. And the tube is hard to misplace due to its crazy red color!&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I had was opening the freaking thing? Good luck with that!</li>
    <li> This ointment is very hydrating and doesn&#x27;t disappear so you might stick to things. It heals cuts but might cause zits for some of you (it did for me)</li>
    <li> While backpacking Australia I was introduced to this ointment and it works for anything. This is the go-to product for anything and no worries about bad reactions.</li>
    <li> Love this! Saved my lips this winter. It smells wonderful and really moisturizers well. It gives your lips a little bit of shine but no color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on accutane and would probably have died from chapped lips without this. Use it when even aquaphor isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
    <li> my lips are so soft..</li>
    <li> Great for chapped skin &amp; lips.  I use it on my cuticles as well.  Be careful about clothes, sheets, and touchscreens - this is a greasy product that transfers to anything you touch.  The smell is light but unique - a little fermented.</li>
    <li> I use this for everything - dry skin, chapped lips, burns, scratches, cuticles. Smells amazing and works really, really well.</li>
    <li> Great balm! I love the smell. And consistency is perfect for applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can stay as a lip gloss and moisturizer for 3 hours!</li>
    <li> have only used it once and then it did help a rash</li>
    <li> My friend in Australia recommended this for my cat.  It worked well!  Now I used it for my dry hands and lips.  It works better than any chapstick.  I only wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> to me, this feels no different from vaseline. i haven&#x27;t experienced it soaking in and only apply before bed because I might as well attempt to get my money&#x27;s worth. I havent noticed any awesome results. just greasy hands.</li>
    <li> Us edit on long flights and seemed to work.</li>
    <li> this stuff is magic. dry lips, patches of skin, anywhere. Think of it like Elizabeth Ardens 8 hour cream, only not stinky and better!</li>
    <li> I use this on my lips and cuticles before bed and it has made a world of difference. It&#x27;s also a pretty big tube so you get your bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> This is ok, I didnt think it did much for me, that vaseline wasn&#x27;t doing.  But I continue use till it is gone.  Pleasant and no nasty scent.</li>
    <li> I have super chapped lips and this is the only ointment that works for me. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I he&#x27;s used this for everything&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used!  Carmex, Burts Bees, and other products that friends of mine have sworn by don&#x27;t even come close to moisturizing as well as this ointment does.</li>
    <li> addicted to this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I ever write on a product that I purchased from Amazon, and for good reason. I originally purchased the product in an attempt to rid myself of stretch marks but had little change (partially because I gained a bit more weight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this product has worked complete wonders on is my tattoo removal. I completely forgot that I had this product, and was using a regular antibiotic ointment with very little difference to the healing of the lasered skin. After using this product, I saw a considerable difference after just one day. In three days the site was almost 70% healed. I am going to the Doc for a second session tomorrow and will definitely let her know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
    <li> I am seriously in love with this ointment. I use it primarily as chapstick and it&#x27;s been working wonders for me. I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out with the passing of time. Since the tube is bigger than your typical chapstick, its harder to loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a VERY thin layer-- it does the trick and the tube lasts for months, despite daily, regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know when I first bought this, I felt that it was suffocating my lips. The consistency is just different, but once you get used to it, you don&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what is says it will. It works well with my extremely sensitive skin. I use it on my hands, spots, lips, everything. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product - I mean it.  This has completely replaced my aquafor, hand cream, foot cream, lip balm and general ointment.  It is somehow so thick, yet not really sticky - it just feels so good and it really, really works!  I just ordered two more of these and a big pot of it.  The perfect protectant for this really cold weather.</li>
    <li> This helps take the sting out of mosquito bites!</li>
    <li> Good ointment.  Thank you so much</li>
    <li> I live in the desert and get extremely chapped lips frequently. This is the only product that has given me lasting relief. I apply it at night before bed and wake up with soft, healed lips!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it for spots, burns, insect bites and as a daily lip balm too - such a shame we can&#x27;t get it in the UK or the US but the shipping was fast so thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like vaseline. Fits great in my wallet</li>
    <li> I love it! This ointment cured my super dry hands.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find it in the regular stores here so its nice</li>
    <li> Great ointment that can be used for many different remedies. I have used it on my lips, burns, and scratches on my baby. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I will put on chapped lips. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> great stuff - immeadiately use when you have a burn!</li>
    <li> Love it, great for bug bites</li>
    <li> Works great and smells good.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these because it works wonderfully on chapped lips. I have not used it on rashes,but my friend does and loves it. Will definately repurchase for additional uses.</li>
    <li> Works great on eczema</li>
    <li> Having a major face issue and this has really been helping me along with Aquaphor and Vasillene.</li>
    <li> My husband and I first found this gem of an ointment while on vacation in Australia.  I had developed a rash while traveling and asked a local pharmacist which over-the-counter product he would recommend.  Lucas Paw Paw worked wonders!!  The rash was much improved after the first day and completely gone by the third application.  We finished the tube we brought back with us and wanted to always have some on hand.  I ordered this from Auction Stations and my only criticism is that while the Amazon site said it might take an extra two or three days - it took approximately a month to receive my order.  Apparently, it had been shipped from Australia to Singapore to the United States.  I will order more as I use it to ensure that I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin, to the point where it will sometimes turn bumpy and patchy for no reason - I even thought I had psoriasis for a little while. The only thing I had every found to fix this before was a prescription steroid ointment. Lucas Pawpaw works great on my skin problem areas. I normally hate putting petroleum products on my skin, but sometimes you just have to poison yourself a little to look pretty. This smells and works great. I think I will explore the non-petroleum based pawpaw ointments before I repurchase this, and I&#x27;ll update this when I do so. But I do plan on buying this again.</li>
    <li> Brilliant all purpose salve and balm for lips, cuticles and other areas that need protection. No scent and hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin! Love!</li>
    <li> Another example of something that I randomly hears about and immediately found on Amazon. My child had a rash around his mouth from sucking on his lovey. I didn&#x27;t want to do anything too gross since it would probably get into his mouth, and this was perfect. It completely cleared the rash in 2 days. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Great for very dry hands, lips, elbows, feet.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product but for the amount of money you have to spend it was not worth it.  In my opinion esos works just as good and its only like three bucks.  Now im not saying you shouldnt by this product because i am a big proponent of the fact that not everything works the same for everybody... so i wouldnt buy it again but maybe it would work good on someone with a different skin type.  :)</li>
    <li> Its function is good but is a little thick. It is like oil, very heavy. So I just use for a while then use hot water to remove. But I have to say , it is function is good</li>
    <li> I heard about the healing properties of Paw Paw skin. It worked for me, but the fruit is not always available. So, I tried the Papaw with family who happened to have it. It did have the desired effect. I have since recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> Super healing and great, thick consistency. Would have given 5 stars, but the scent is a bit odd...smells...medicine-y. I love to use it on my dry lips seasonally, so I can smell it...can&#x27;t smell it if it isn&#x27;t on your face. Overall, works like a dream. Worth the price...lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Authentic product, thank u</li>
    <li> feels good - use it on my lips, too</li>
    <li> After reading so many great reviews about this online, I decided to give it a try.  I was somewhat worried about ordering beauty products through Amazon after reading that a lot of people complain about receiving expired products.  Thankfully, I got this one sealed and there was no odor or &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; aspect of the product when I opened it up.  The tube is bigger than I thought.  Got a great deal and shipping was so fast!  Got here in two days!</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my daughters ear wound. no scars. Wish the price was lower like the Target site</li>
    <li> A cheaper alternative for helping maintain my eczema skin patches. Though it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well, I use it as a primary ointment (8x&#x27;s + a day) and use my other expensive ointment as only a supplement (1-2x&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> Good, good, good!!!!  I use it for my lips and i love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I discovered Papaw ointment in Australia while reading native fashion magazines (turns out all of the models include it on their &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; list for their bags.)  I purchased a tube in Brisbane to use as insect ointment while in Bali.  I soon discovered that Lucas Papaw ointment really is something no one should go without!  So many uses- it is the perfect natural healing remedy.  I use on my newborn weekly to treat where she may scratch her face with her nails.  Just a dab of ointment and the scratch is clean and healed within a day.  EVERY MOTHER SHOULD HAVE A STASH OF THIS MIRACLE OINTMENT</li>
    <li> The best do-it-all ointment - chapped lips, cuts, bug bites, cuticles. I use this on everything! And it has lasted me forever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. Nothing special</li>
    <li> The smell drove me crazy. I didn&#x27;t find it to be vastly different than any other petroleum-based ointment.</li>
    <li> Helps under chin for drool rash on my teething 6 month old! Worked better than our prescribed hydrocortisone also. Did not work for his eczema.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product. I use it so much, basically on all skin conditions. Even on my daughters, which are toddlers,  bc it&#x27;s a save and natural product. I really love it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  I&#x27;m not too wild about this product and it is doubtful that I will re-purchase.  I find this ointment pretty much the same as a heavy duty hand lotion.</li>
    <li> You only need a tiny amount of this. I use it as a general ointment. It has helped cure cracked lips, ragged cubicles, even cracked heels. It a good versatile ointment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on accutane so naturally my lips would crack and break all the time. Uber painful, was not a fan. But this s*** saved my lips from that doom. My lips never break anymore and I only need to apply it like 10 times a day (vs like 20 times a day for Burt&#x27;s bees) 10/10 would recommend for other victims of the accutane abuse</li>
    <li> This ointment is the best for chapped lips. I smear it on at night and it takes me through the whole next day!</li>
    <li> I am into all natural remedies and this one is great for chapped lips and most important is not as addictive as other brands.  It is a little greasy but you can apply with a Q tip.  I have only used it on my lips but I hear its great in place of neosporin.  Chemical free is the way to be!</li>
    <li> love this product, its good for cracked nipples when breast feeding</li>
    <li> Friend recommanded this to me. It can use for most of your body, from chapped lip to bug bite. I like it.</li>
    <li> There is nothing as wonderful as PaPaw. I use it for everything. EVERYTHING. Cuts, burns, and as my daily chapstick.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product!! Used it on my daughters chapped nose when she was sick and then on my sunburn days later! It soothed my burn so good and helped it heal quicker! Just ordered a bigger tube for our trip to the beach!!</li>
    <li> Thrilled with this! I read about it on Rachel Zoe&#x27;s blog and my daughter and I love it. We use it as a makeup primer; it makes our skin glowy without being shiny or greasy, and it is a bit tacky which helps makeup go on and stay on. Our pores look smaller, too. So happy!</li>
    <li> People make claims about this product that seemed exaggerated to me, but after using it in person, I am more impressed with this cream than any other I have ever come across. It&#x27;s worth ordering it from Australia! Some of the negative reviews claim it is just vaseline with papaya, which it may be, but this is no vaseline! It completely transformed my dry, sensitive skin into baby smooth skin and healed irritation.</li>
    <li> I carry this with me everywhere, all the time. It&#x27;s incredible. I travel often and always into different climates. On top of this, I began accutane 4 months ago. Using accutane almost guarantees dried, cracked lips but combating it with Lucas&#x27;s pawpaw treatment has allowed me to avoid dealing with the pain all together. I&#x27;m extremely grateful.</li>
    <li> I do not go anywhere with out it!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;m the past 20 years I have had such dry cracked lips I have developed a habit of picking the skin off of them. I have tried seriously everything on the market for lips and nothing has really healed them. Within days of using this my lips were completely healed. I have been free of picking dead skin off since then! All I can say is THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Liked this ointment. Great lip balm and can also be used on cuticles and any other dry areas. Very moisturizing and soothing.</li>
    <li> Not so natural since petrolatum based. Threw it away.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Great on chapped lips and dry cuticles.  Also, nice smell.  A little greasy at first but fine once it is absorbed</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...my lips were cracking and peeling non-stop this winter, regardless of what products I used. I tried every chap stick I could find, honey, vaseline, you name it. This is the only thing that has actually worked for me. The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on if you have something to drink. You&#x27;ll need to reapply.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! I normally have chapped lips around this time of year (winter). And sometimes they even bleed due to dryness. I use this product every day and i no longer have a problem! I saw Michelle Fawn using it and thought it seemed reliable and sure enough I receive a great product!!! definatly a five star.</li>
    <li> This salve gets raves from so many people I thought I&#x27;d like it more than I did.  I don&#x27;t really care for the scent (or taste when one inevitably gets some in the mouth)and it makes your lips tingle slightly, which feels strange.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be that moisturizing on my lips either, like it just sat on top instead of penetrating the skin.  It was, however, okay on my cuticles, but for the price I would not re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Thiis works great for itchy skin, and my husband used it for chigger bites. He was very impressed.</li>
    <li> The best product for skin burns I have ever come across, from oil, fire or sun burns, this is the BEST, my son never had a diaper rash, we used it daily on him. Also great for minor cuts and scrapes to keep it moist and desinfected</li>
    <li> Great for soothing cuts and rashes. convenient size for travel. Has done well for cracked skin in our cold weather.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing! takes away dryness on my lips overnight. Some might say it&#x27;s just petroleum jelly but I feel like there is more of a moisturizing and hydrating benefit to it, plus it has a sweet smell which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> Inuse it on my lips and sometimes on very dry spots on my face. So far so good</li>
    <li> It is REALLY not all that. I don&#x27;t care which celeb puts it in their bag. Vasoline, coconut oil or any other moisture product comparable.</li>
    <li> Used on my cuticles- bad idea. Destroyed my nails. Will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by a magazine- did not use properly, obviously.</li>
    <li> The ointment works okay for me, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be more effective than any other ointment I&#x27;ve used to make it worth the price.  It&#x27;s greasy, so it gets on clothes, pens, paper, etc.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how big the tube is (I purchased the 25g size).  I wish it was tinted, but the balm itself is so effective that it softens my lips to the point where I don&#x27;t have to constantly reapply it, which is the first lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used that does that!  Great item, really glad I tried it.  Fast S&amp;H.</li>
    <li> Nice ointment,. A little goes a long way, so you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Super Balm !!! used with pleasure !!!</li>
    <li> Works well on many skin issues including minor burns</li>
    <li> Nice ointment. Work on new and even 2 weeks old scratch. My kitten happens to be very playful and bite and/or scratch on my skin a lot, this helps healing my open wound faster than leave my scratch alone.</li>
    <li> This ointment did a wonderful job healing my cracked lips.  I even stopped getting cold sores.  I used it nightly until I had used up the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to buy more and found Papaya Gold Pawpaw &amp; Manuka Honey.  I ordered it instead and it seems to work a little better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! If you have dry lips, that is for you. Once, I got it with me on a plane, and it helped with cuticles, elbows and lips dryness a loot!!</li>
    <li> Cracked lips, eczema, blemishes I slather this everywhere and the next day my skin is less irritation, less red and on its way to healing. LOVE LOVE LOVE this as a nightly balm on my lips.</li>
    <li> use it on airplanes and stay healthy</li>
    <li> The product itself is nice, but I think it costs WAY too much for the amount that you get. It&#x27;s basically travel size.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works well on chapped lips, dry skin, and blisters. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried this ointment for eczema and it&#x27;s not quite my favorite but close enough. It&#x27;s thick and has a very faint, nice smell. It&#x27;s better for hands but you can use it around the eyes if you have nothing else. I like Manuka Honey and Tamanu cream better for my eyes, but this one works for the eyes better than, say, Vitamin E oils. It&#x27;s also a lot cheaper than creams.</li>
    <li> Love the portable size, the red color and the fact that each tube is sealed until you open it. Helped my terminally chapped hands. A bit on the greasy side at first (Vaseline like) but quickly absorbs into the skin. Will buy more.</li>
    <li> This does keep you healthy on the plane.</li>
    <li> Just ok. Nothing special.</li>
    <li> A variety of uses.  Use it every day.</li>
    <li> Believe the hype around this product, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing. Nothing treats chapped lips and dry hands better. It&#x27;s seriously a miracle. Super recommended!</li>
    <li> Why you guys lie and say this works when it doesn&#x27;t? A waist of money. And mine came half empty. Like wtf. I have a rash on my upper lip and used this and it&#x27;s still red. Made no difference. So my advice to you don&#x27;t waist money on products like this.</li>
    <li> A must have medicine cabinet ointment. Great for rashes, scrapes, or burns.</li>
