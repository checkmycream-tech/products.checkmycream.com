      <li>I am all around happy with this purchase!</li>
      <li>VERY happy with this purchase.  </li>
      <li>Good texture, works well!</li>
      <li>Lives up to it&#x27;s promise, great product.</li>
      <li>no irritation or redness proactive has great products.</li>
      <li>I love this product!!</li>
      <li>What I will add is that this vendor has good customer service.  </li>
      <li>This is a really good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I already knew that the product was good.  </li>
      <li>but I think it would work better used with the proactive system rather that on its own, its a good moisturizer and has helped even out my skin tone somewhat</li>
      <li>nice product.  </li>
      <li>this is a generous size and the moisturizer is effective at exfoliating, preventing acne and moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Great moisturizer for night time or even just more thirsty while oily skin, while I still haven&#x27;t found out if this one is oil free , maybe just me, but</li>
      <li>And the smell is so light and so pleasant.  </li>
      <li>I have finally found the PERFECT moisturizer for my combination skin.</li>
      <li>my kids love</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product and noticed it helped even my skin tone by making my brown spots lighter.</li>
      <li>If you are young would probably be a good deal.</li>
      <li>Lovely, lovely skin cream moisturizer and helps clear acne.  </li>
      <li>Therefore this route of ordering each product individually as needed was more convenient and cheaper.</li>
      <li>My skin was really beat up from all the acne I have had and continue to still have.</li>
      <li>This causes it to be much pricier</li>
      <li>So when he ran out I really did not want to get onto another contract with Proactiv.</li>
      <li>I noticed my wrinkles and my skin really smoothed out after about a week of using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it really helps there skin to be free of spots, where other products have failed - great</li>
      <li>it gives ur face  a layer of instant rich , non greasy supply and it lasts, I was looking for a good moisturizer that is great for calming my oily, active skin, I still have adult  acne which r not serious but annoying, and I wanted enough moisture instead of just pure acne treatment lotion  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
      <li>But so far it has done more for my face then the countless other things that I have tried, so I will stick it with it.</li>
      <li>I am way to young for that, so chalked it up to the years of acne taking its toll on my face.</li>
      <li>and I am noticing some results, but I am by no means commercial ready.</li>
      <li>it feels like silk and leaves your skin feeling the same, only clean and not lumpy/bumpy at the same time.</li>
      <li>Not what I expected, extremely drying and darkens the skin tremendously!</li>
      <li>There was a little mix up, I contacted the vendor they took care of the error quickly with no extra work required on my part.  </li>
      <li>I did notice that using the moisturizer as explained in the directions does not give you 90 days of the product, as I run out in less than 60 days using the large tub.</li>

    <li> Lovely, lovely skin cream moisturizer and helps clear acne.  Can&#x27;t live without it.  Feels like silk on your skin. Not oily at all.</li>
    <li> I used this product and my skin feels like silk, no irritation or redness proactive has great products.</li>

    <li> Proactiv products works well on my teenager son&#x27;s skin. So when he ran out I really did not want to get onto another contract with Proactiv. Therefore this route of ordering each product individually as needed was more convenient and cheaper.</li>
    <li> I already knew that the product was good.  What I will add is that this vendor has good customer service.  There was a little mix up, I contacted the vendor they took care of the error quickly with no extra work required on my part.  I appreciate the service.</li>
    <li> Good texture, works well!</li>
    <li> my kids love proactiv+ it really helps there skin to be free of spots, where other products have failed - great</li>
    <li> nice product.  I always use up my proactive products.  others may sit in the drawer for years, but not proactive.  this is a generous size and the moisturizer is effective at exfoliating, preventing acne and moisturizing.  it feels like silk and leaves your skin feeling the same, only clean and not lumpy/bumpy at the same time.</li>
    <li> Lives up to it&#x27;s promise, great product. Will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for night time or even just more thirsty while oily skin, while I still haven&#x27;t found out if this one is oil free , maybe just me, but it gives ur face  a layer of instant rich , non greasy supply and it lasts, I was looking for a good moisturizer that is great for calming my oily, active skin, I still have adult  acne which r not serious but annoying, and I wanted enough moisture instead of just pure acne treatment lotion  that only gives the minimum moisture and  tighten my skin uncomfortably  , also oily skin in cold weather , this will work so well</li>
    <li> Not what I expected, extremely drying and darkens the skin tremendously!</li>
    <li> I ordered this and have been using it religiously every day, it has made a difference but I think it would work better used with the proactive system rather that on its own, its a good moisturizer and has helped even out my skin tone somewhat</li>
    <li> Yes and got it in a couple of days!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!</li>
    <li> over priced and not much glory.  In fact did not see any difference.  Although it does keep your complexion soft, and you use less of the pricey things.  Probably depends on your age.  I bought it for moisture, it does about medium with this.  If you are young would probably be a good deal.</li>
    <li> This is a really good moisturizer. It glides on like butter. My skin was really beat up from all the acne I have had and continue to still have. I am only 23, but I was getting wrinkles on forehead and around my mouth. I am way to young for that, so chalked it up to the years of acne taking its toll on my face. I noticed my wrinkles and my skin really smoothed out after about a week of using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note:&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the proactiv+ 3 step system for over a month and I am noticing some results, but I am by no means commercial ready. But so far it has done more for my face then the countless other things that I have tried, so I will stick it with it.</li>
    <li> I have finally found the PERFECT moisturizer for my combination skin. Everything else I have used has either made my skin too oily or too dry.  VERY happy with this purchase.  And the smell is so light and so pleasant.  I do not use the proactiv line and a girl at the proctiv kiosk told me I should just try the moisturizer.  I am all around happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> For me, it did not clear up sh**</li>
