    <li> Love this perfume!  Searched the internet for the best price and found it here on amazon for half of what it was going for on other sites!</li>
    <li> Suitable for 25 year old women use. Before, after, adjustable taste good, the bottle body is beautiful. Unfortunately the seller did not check the goods before shipment of used date, I use after that this is an expired goods. So, it is not satisfied.</li>
    <li> The perfume has an amazing scent. Light and floral. The price is the best I have seen. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this perfume for me for my birthday... I&#x27;ve mixed it into my rotation of other perfumes, including l&#x27;eau d&#x27;issey and Armani Mania.  It smells like berries and wine to me, with a little vanilla and floral mixed in.  It has a lush smell without being heavy and is a very unique and different scent.  Three spritzes sprayed to the neck/chest area last about 1/2 the day.  Overall, it&#x27;s not my favorite scent but I still enjoy it and get compliments on it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  after wearing this perfume for over a year, it is now one of my favorites; it really grew on me.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day, but maybe that&#x27;s b/c my nose is getting used to it now.  I still get tons of compliments on the scent.</li>
    <li> The color of this perfume should be light purple/pink but the perfume i received has a yellow fluid inside the bottle... I don&#x27;t know if it is because I got an old one? or a fake one?.... i feel like i received a fake one...</li>
    <li> Heavenly scent, reminds me of Spring! Better than previous &amp;#34;Paris&amp;#34; offerings, has a more sophisticated vibe without being too strong.</li>
    <li> YSL Paris and Parisienne Perfumes are my 2 all time favorites.  I have been spritzing these scents for many years now.  To me, nothing compares to the intoxicating aroma of the roses that spray out of these simple perfume bottles.  Parisenne is shear elegance to me.  Thank you Amazon for offering this wonderful perfume online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order it.</li>
    <li> I purchased it as a gift for my mother, I can smell it after she wear it for long hours, we live In Texas where its hard to keep your perfume so long due to hot humid weather.but this one works ...super fresh feminine smell,and very good price.try to purchase the bigger size if available, as you will love it and will finish the small size soon.</li>

    <li> Love the scent of this.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites.  Hard to find in stores though.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for perfumes with a rose scent, and this is no exception. Much less \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; than Chloe Chloe. I wish it lasted longer but on the flip side, it&#x27;s not overpowering. Amazon had it for a great price and I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing in the future.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance. It&#x27;s sweet and woody. It stays on for a long time. The bottle has a nice weight to it and looks like a jewel.</li>
    <li> My daughter fell in love with this perfume in the stores, but the price was pretty steep. She didn&#x27;t expect to get it for her birthday, so when I was able to get it on Amazon at a good price she was thrilled.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and to get it at such a good price was wonderful.  thank you!  I will order again.</li>
    <li> não tenho o contato do vendedor e não consegui cancelar este item ... pois vou embora de miami dia 27/11 a noite então não posso receber depois deste dia ....por favor quero uma solução</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend. i love the smell. I don&#x27;t care if she likes it or not</li>
    <li> i bought this perfume because my relative told me it smells good. then, when i received it from amazon and smell it, i don&#x27;t like it. it smells like rose water. i well just spray it in my apartment because i well never use it and go out.</li>
    <li> Fake all day long!! Don&#x27;t buy. It&#x27;s watered down and yellow instead of purple.</li>
