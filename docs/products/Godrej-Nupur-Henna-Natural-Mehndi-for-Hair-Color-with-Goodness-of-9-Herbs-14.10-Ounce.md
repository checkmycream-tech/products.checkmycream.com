<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very beautiful color and my hair feels so healthy afterward.</li>
    <li> I have bought the smaller size bags before and have never had a problem.  There is absolutely NO HENNA in this mix.  My hair is very sensitive to Henna and did not change color.  This product did not provide any tint whatsoever.  I will NEVER purchase this again.  A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> this will completely ruin your hair</li>
    <li> I just use it, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this henna since it was my first attempt. Wanted color change but didn&#x27;t really expect it since my natural color is very dark brown. Wanted to see what it was like as a conditioner. Mixed w coconut milk. Went on very easy but hair felt brittle and like straw.  Natural curl pattern was stretched and very relaxed (almost non existent, just frizzy). This stuff was super grainy.  There were still pebbles left in my hair after rinsing and deep conditioning.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try another brand of henna before I give up on it because this stuff didn&#x27;t leave a good first impression. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Colored my gray hair perfectly.  I love the variety of colors in my hair.  My gray hair turned blonde, light brown hair turned reddish, and the rest of my hair stayed dark brown which really complements my skin tone.  I wear it in waves and twists.  This product conditions and gives my hair shine.  I use it once a month.</li>
    <li> Not gritty like others. Easy to rinse out. I am Caucasian with mousy brown hair and this makes my hair a bright, deep, luxurious red. I make my mixture with water, lemon juice, coconut oil, one egg white, and cheapo hair conditoner. Mix it all up to a yogurt consistency and let sit overnight. After putting in my hair I leave it in for 4-5 hours. Repeat every month or so. Works great and will not use any other brand. I feel the 9 herbal ingredients really make my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> makes my hair soft and healthy</li>
    <li> Love using this!&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t actually tried using this on my hair, but use it to make my own henna at home.&lt;br /&gt;To make henna, I use:&lt;br /&gt;-hot black coffee&lt;br /&gt;-lemon/lime&lt;br /&gt;-eucalyptus oil&lt;br /&gt;-mehndi powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix them all together in equal parts until I get a paint-like consistency (not too clumpy/dry, but also not too watered down)&lt;br /&gt;I either buy/make my own cellophane triangles to form and then put the henna in!</li>
    <li> The color never showed i held it for 4 hours and pretty much do nothing.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown curly dry hair. It made my hair softer, more moisturized and my curls more definite, helped from hair loss a little. but the color faded in 2 weeks. I bought it more for its curing qualities than for color though anyway. So, i like this mix.</li>
    <li> The first time I ordered this product it was in the packaging that is pictured and worked great my hair loved the product. The second time I ordered it came in a newer version of packaging. This version of the henna powder was darker and I would let soak a lot longer because I was not seeing the same color change as I did before with the original packaging. It never got as much of color change as the original packaging of the product. After using it on my hair it did seem to make my hair much more brittle and I never had this problem with the product before. I do agree that with the newer packaged henna could be mixed with something and the quality is maybe 1/3 as good as the original stuff. I will not be using this product again since the manufacturer seems to have cut back on quality.</li>
    <li> I not only use this product for the rich henna color that it provides; but, I also use it to do a henna gloss and conditioning treatment.</li>
    <li> (I had some issues with packaging but that&#x27;s with the seller  -  not the product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Jamila.  I really do.  But realistically all I wanted the Nupur for is for a conditioning gloss and I didn&#x27;t want to buy the ingredients individually - in other words I wanted a cheaper henna.  That sounds horrible,  doesn&#x27;t it?  Well,  I was impressively mind blown when I actually used this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stick pretty much to a basic recipe,  using only Red Zinger tea,  a bit of oil and some water before letting this sit as per the instructions.  Then I applied it...again per their instructions.  Several hours later I rinsed,  then shampooed with Chandrika soap.  I did add a bit of coconut oil to the ends of my hair,  but I do that with every henna to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.  And it loves me back.  I&#x27;m already henna-ed with Jamila,  and the Nupur enriched and beautified it even moreso.  I will rebuy this,  even if I end up using it less often as a gloss.</li>
    <li> Just like the picture. I received it unopened.</li>
    <li> It is better than other product!  I like it. It make my hair golden color and cover the grey hair</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price!  Thanks</li>
    <li> The best henna I have come across so far! Mix mine with coconut milk and add a little wheat germ oil, olive oil and coconut oil to the mix. It washes off easily with none of that grit you get with the use of some henna products. I recommend this 150%! Fantastic for my natural kinky hair. Leaves hair soft and helped to reduce breakage</li>
    <li> This stuff is great as long as you understand your only going to get some variation of copper or red. I get a beautiful copper that covers my gray. I unprocessed coily hair that tends to dry out easily, so l have to mix the henna with ingredients that will prevent the henna from drying out my hair and making it hard as straw. Here is my recipe. Mix  1 cup of henna, 1\2 cup of olive oil, 1 whole can of coconut milk and 1 small lemon, cut the lemon and squeeze out the juice into the mixture. Now your do some work stirring it up, try to get the mixture as smooth as you can. It should start turning the color of milk chocolate. Once you have stirred it on to a pudding like texture, you can let it set anywhere from one to 4 hours are more. When your ready apply it to your hair with gloved hands. I smear coconut oil on my forehead, ears and behind my neck to prevent it from staining my skin and I leave the henna on my head for about 2 hours. But i have noticed it starting to dye my gray hair as soon I put it on. I think an hour will do. After you let marinate in your hair rinse it out until the water runs clean. Condition your hair as you normally do. I recommend not using any conditioner that has alcohol on it. The alcohol will  dry out your hair. This should work for anyone with dry hair no matter your color.</li>
    <li> Very poor color payoff compared to other brands, even for hair-grade henna.</li>
    <li> Great quality henna.  I use it for my hendigo treatments and it works like a charm.  It&#x27;s nicely sifted so no large particles which results in a nice smooth paste.  I mix it with coffee and lemon juice and let is sit overnight.  It&#x27;s ready to use next morning and I leave it on for 3 hours.  It gives me the results I am looking for.  I have bought this several times and will continue for such a great price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about a month since the first time I used the henna and my hair still looks and feels great! I love the color and it left my hair really soft and strong. It was rather drying and hard to get out though. But I most definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> The color only stayed for two weeks.</li>
    <li> I suspect this product was old and had an old expiration date on it because it did not change colors like FRESH henna does after mixing it and letting it sit.  If you purchase, make sure you check the expiration dates on your henna and send it back if it has expired.  Wish I had checked the expiration date before throwing away the package.</li>
    <li> My second time purchasing henna on amazon. Loved it the first time. second time product works fine but when rinsing out hair feels like it has fine sand. Took multiple rinses to get the fine sand out of my hair</li>
    <li> I have used this henna for 3 different applications now, and each time my hair is softer, silkier, full of bounce, and a beautiful dark auburn color! I have strategically placed gray hair on the front edges of my head and they are dyed a nice orange-red that does not stand out. My only problem is after I leave it in for about two hours, my edges are sore while washing it out and I have patches of dryness. For the mix I use 1 tbsp of ACV and warm green tea for the bulk of liquid. After 12hr color release time, I mix with a non-cone conditioner for application and use for both my daughter and myself.</li>
    <li> Turns my hair copper red.</li>
    <li> yikes sorry henna guys, got my reviews backwards. nupur made my hair bright orange! henna guys medium brown makes hair medium brown just as promised</li>
    <li> This henna provides great color to my 4c natural hair. To cut on dryness, mix as directed then add your favorite deep conditioner to mix and apply to hair. Without conditioner or olive oil added to henna hair can be very dry.</li>
    <li> I really like this henna.  I&#x27;ve tried only one other brand but this one makes my hair very soft.  I&#x27;m still trying different techniques on mixes and how long to leave it on.  I think Ieft it on too long this time because my hair was more orange so will try less time next time I use it.  It is a large bag so will last a long time as well.</li>
    <li> This was the first henna I used to color my hair and I love it! Vibrant, lasting color and shine!</li>
    <li> i love it. i have relaxed hair and it treated my hair well</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! i have dark hair and it turned it into a beautiful chestnut color and i LOVE IT! in the sun and indoor light it looks beautiful with the glow of red! my white hairs are the most awesome copper red color. It also left my hair super soft and healthy looking. here&#x27;s how i mixed mine for my mid back length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup henna +2 heaping tbls&lt;br /&gt;1 egg&lt;br /&gt;a few tbl. canned coconut milk&lt;br /&gt;and a few tbl. regular milk&lt;br /&gt;i mixed it till it was a thick paste then sprinkled a little water on top and left it to develop for 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;after the 4 hours of letting the henna sit in its glass bowl i mixed in the water i had topped it off with previously ( the water had turned red)&lt;br /&gt;then applied it to my hair in sections.&lt;br /&gt;I let it sit in my hair for 4 hours then just rinsed it out, no shampoo and its beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;GET IT!&lt;br /&gt;will get another bag! :)</li>
    <li> Arrived early. Did not add anything extra (like indigo or coffee). Followed the instructions exactly, and had a great result! It did dry my scalp a bit, but nothing terrible. I put some argan oil in my hair before applying the henna, and it was very easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> this product may be good for someone else but not for me/ too messy, too red, too bad..maybe i just didn&#x27;t know how to use it, but i will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!  It makes my hair silky and smooth.  It&#x27;s not nearly as drying as the other henna.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I noticed a difference between it and the Jamila Henna I used prior. I mixed this henna with coconut milk to use as a conditioner. It worked well but my curls were lost.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the henna or the use of coconut milk. I will try it again but other than that, it was good.</li>
    <li> I use this on my natural hair and to keep the grays at bay lol....the first time using I was nervous because my hair was orangy but after a few days subsided. I love how it strengthened my strands and let me go completely natural and still cover these pesky grays</li>
    <li> I mixed with hot tea and my regular hair conditioner, let sit for 2-3 hrs. Applied all over my head, wrapped up and wore a hat then went to bed! After a good wash in the morning i loved the red color which was added to my hair :) lovely auburn</li>
    <li> LOVE this henna. It even smelled fresher than other kinds I have gotten. My hair and me are very happy :)</li>
    <li> Good quality! I buy this every so often to send it to my mother. She is allergic to hair dye so this Henna and coconut oil mixtures has been a lifesaver for her.</li>
    <li> There are so many nutrients how can you go wrong? My ends are color treated and heat damaged and are now sealed to almost a 100%. I wasn&#x27;t ready to cut them of yet and this has helped. My hair looks better now that I&#x27;ve done a second treatment. I finger detangle and now it is a breeze I think the second treatment created slip. My hair is shoulder length so I only used 150 grams. I mixed in hot water, honey, and lemon juice. I let it sit overnight and left it on my hair for a minimum of Six hours. You should definitely add your favorite essential oil because the smell is terrible. I did loosen my curl pattern. However I have kinky coils so it&#x27;s no problem for me.  Another reason why I had slip probably.</li>
    <li> Great purchase and price.</li>
    <li> After mixing this product and waiting to applied product. That&#x27;s 2 to 3 hours wait before applying to hair. Than an additional 2 to 3 hour wait with product on hair.  Please beware that the product will change hair color.  My hair color is 1b, with very little grey, my hair color changed to a dark brown. I found it to be time consuming; however, I do like the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but just not for me. A lot of people have had great results from it and the first time I used it, I loved it. The results were great. The second time was okay as well. I loved the color that it gave me. I decided to relax 3 weeks after the second treatment and I was horrified. My hair came out so bad, I lost a lot and I have never lost that much hair when relaxing until after using this product. It broke off so bad that I had to cut and I lost 2 inches of hair. I am still experiencing bad breakage as well and I am 4 weeks post relaxer. If anybody can tell me where I went wrong. I mixed it with hot water and added conditioner and oil to it. I shampooed it out 4 times and deep conditioned and it was fine. I didn&#x27;t experience any problems til it was time to relax. I noticed that after washing my relaxer out my hair was so hard that I kept having to add conditioner and constantly having to detangle with the conditioner in my hair and my hair was just shedding and breaking. What happened????? Is this product for people who are natural only or should I wait a month and then relax. Not for sure but scared to use it.</li>
    <li> no color released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretreated the powder as below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hot water, lemon juice, covered with plastic film to keep wet, and had it sit over night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the second day, i did not observed orange color when tested it w my finger. but still applied it to my hair, then wrapped with plastic film to keep wet, and let it stand for 8 hrs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No color at all! the grey hair is still white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the problem?</li>
    <li> This was my first time using Henna.  First i want to say you don&#x27;t need to use anywhere near as much as most vendors say. Which is a mistake on their part, because the henna site I was looking at was expensive especially considering the amount they said I needed and that kept me using drugstore dye for several more years. Until my color was discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this inexpensive product with so many good reviews so decided to try it.  I mixed 1 1/2 cups which is like a third or fourth of the $10 500 gram bag.  And it was way more than I needed. I kept globbing it on since I had so much, yet still there was a ton left over.  This bag would likely last me 5-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it about 6 hours a head of time. I can&#x27;t remember if I added anything acidic.  Left it on my head for 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;The color is nice. Pretty similar to what I had before.  It was a little drying even though I had applied some coconut oil to the ends, so I applied more after.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner since I stopped using shampoo several months ago.  (serisously, most skin &amp; hair care products are there to solve problems caused by other skin and hair care products. Just say no. starting with cleansers. They interfere with skin/scalp function)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I;m going to mix about a third cup, apply to roots only and leave on for 3 hours.  Note, my hair has always taken and held dye pretty well.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great price</li>
    <li> Favorite brand great price.  Biggest bag they make.  Cheaper than any ebay seller.  thanks will purchase again</li>
    <li> Works beautifully along with indigo powder. This brand is high quality. I had perfect results in one hour. It is also a great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two years now to &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; my dark brown hair a delicious Cherry Coke color, and I&#x27;ve never once had issues. My split ends are a thing of the past, my hair has grown in much more lush and thick than it used to be, and my hair shines with health. I mix hot water and lemon juice into the powder and get a lush red out of it. I use 1/2 to a full cup depending on how long my hair is and with this huge bag I will have enough to last me through this year and the next.  Edit 01 January 2017: I still use this product, but I now use a hot neem oil treatment afterward to offset any dryness in the hair. Still a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly.  In addition it was very affordable.</li>
    <li> This will dye your hair dark orange because of the Henna (if you have light or gray hair). It isn&#x27;t dark brown or anywhere near it. I&#x27;m okay with it because it still conditions my hair and thickens and healthier. If you need to darken your hair, purchase Indigo and mix in with this.</li>
    <li> Such a nice blend of herbs, my hair loved it. Blended smoothly, little gritty but no twigs etc. I used this in a 2 step indigo process &amp; I wasn&#x27;t looking for a bright red/orange stain, hoping the amla would brown it down &amp; it did. Would recommend this to anyone with a darker hair color &amp; minimal greys. Not sure about a hendigo blend, as the other herbs might not get along with finicky indigo. However worked great for me &amp; my 2 step for black tones.</li>
    <li> This product is a great price for the amount and the quality of the product. This brand Henna is VERY consistent in it&#x27;s texture, color, dye release, smell, and how finely it has been sifted. No twigs or leaves left in the hair after rinsing this product out due to the fine sift. Also, the color gives a nice rich red that can easily be coerced into a brown and even a black if you finagle some things with your mix and application process. I always know that I am getting a great henna when I buy this product. It leaves my hair shiny, silky, strong, and smooth. I feel like a Pantene commercial girl after I use this henna on my hair. On the skin it also gives a performance congruent with it&#x27;s performance on hair. A constant purchaser!</li>
    <li> I switched from pure henna to Godrej Nupur a while back and it has made a world of difference. Not only is it finer, stickier and easier to spread on hair, but its color is a truer red than the orangey hue you get from BAQ henna. My hair is strong, shiny and a lovely shade of red.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair with chemicals for years.  Sometimes using drugstore box dyes, other times dyes from Sally&#x27;s or from Amazon that are more for &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; use.  Last summer I did some highlights on my hair using a cap.  They looked good, a medium to dark blonde on my brown hair, but my hair was drier than I would like.  As fall approached, I was looking to try red again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used some dye from Sally&#x27;s a few different times, but the reds would not last (they usually don&#x27;t) and would leave the bleached portions of my hair looking unnatural colors, which can happen sometimes, even though I tried to choose natural reds as opposed to purple reds.  I got sick of putting more and more chemicals on my hair and having it look worse and worse, so I did some research on henna and eventually picked up a package of this at the local Indian grocery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels great now.  It looks great.  I was after a brighter red shade and I got it.  Random people will seriously stop me in the store or on the sidewalk and tell me how much they like my hair color, or ask me how I get it so shiny.  This is the only thing I have done.  I still wash my hair in warm to hot water, I still use the same shampoo and conditioner, I still let it air dry a bit and then blow dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like some people use this without doing research or knowing what to expect, which is a bad idea.  Yes it can help make your hair more manageable, but it will likely also give it some red color (especially if you do not have black hair), depending on what you mix it with and how acidic the mix is.  That is what henna does.  That is the only color henna will dye your hair.  Orange or red tones.  That&#x27;s it.  If you don&#x27;t want orange or red tones, don&#x27;t use this!  Maybe try cassia obovata powder instead or a mixture of this and the cassia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this does not wash out like box hair dye.  I have not done my hair in 6 or so weeks.  If I had used chemical dye, my hair would be a strange brassy brown color.  But it&#x27;s still red and shiny!  Henna is pretty much permanent.  You cannot use bleach and bleach it out.  You cannot dye over it with chemicals: A. because if this product has the tiniest amount of metallic salts, you hair will be fried (and these things aren&#x27;t listed on the ingredients) and B. even if this is quality stuff, the dye won&#x27;t take like it should.  I&#x27;ve read about some people lightening their hennaed hair with lemon juice with some success, but that&#x27;s also very drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the color your hennaed hair will be depends on your starting color.  If its blonde, you&#x27;re more likely to get orange/copper penny type colors.  If your hair is brown, you&#x27;ll get more auburn colors.  If your hair is grey, it will likely be orange.  This will not magically make your hair a uniform color.  If you have highlights in your hair, you will still have highlights after hennaing.  If you henna over a lightened color, then again over your dark roots, you will still have lighter ends and darker roots.  If you use an acidic liquid to mix this for dye release, then the color will darken over a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, hennaing hair is a long and smelly process.  When you mix the powder it smells like hay or some odd tea or something.  And then it can be difficult to get into the hair and make sure it&#x27;s even, it takes some work, but it&#x27;s doable.  And then once it is in the hair, if you want good color, you should leave it in for a few hours.  So this is definitely not like a regular dye job, yet some people go into the process expecting it to be just like any other coloring in process and one that they can remove if they don&#x27;t like it, but it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great product, I like the price, I like the size of the package.  I think others would love it too if they know how to use it and do their research first.</li>
    <li> This Godrej Nupur Mehndi is really cool. It makes your hair healthy, shining and beautiful. I really love this product.</li>
    <li> My hair which where dark brown with a little bit of red turned bright orange when I used this product.  This not real henna, but it is a set of various herbs.  My bright orange hair (which I did not like) were not any more shinier or healthier after using it.  I was surprised that this product actually covered my grey hairs (I&#x27;ll see what happens after couple of washes).  I will not recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have decided to go with natural aryuvedic hair care and I bought these along with other Indian well known hair herbs and I was not disappointed, my hair is healthier thicker and no &#x27;chemical hair color &#x27;  I added indigo powder for darker color.. Perfect . Colors gray well.&lt;br /&gt;Hair background, Asian , straight hair, mid back length.&lt;br /&gt;And the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Have just used this for the first time and am quite happy. This is my first experience using henna to color my hair and I was a little worried but it turned out great and my hair feels silkier than before the color. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nupur henna for the past months and I&#x27;m still very impressed with the results. Only takes a few hours to release color (last time I only kept it for 3.5 and still worked fine), has a somewhat pleasant, earth-y scent (for henna, anyways ;)) and lasts without fading for a good 6-8 weeks. The color is a good coral-y red, which makes for a beautiful mahogany on darker browns and blacks. Very recommended, especially for us curly ladies :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brand and product. Then henna is rich in color and is very easy to use. I sometimes will use green tea when mixing up a batch.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I never tried henna before. Great color and no allergic reaction at all! I will choose this product again.</li>
    <li> This thing does wonders for the hair. It&#x27; looks nice and shiny after a few applications. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was my favorite for my hair for several years now.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair with grey roots. This product turned all of the grey hair carrot top red! Do not use if you have grey hair.</li>
    <li> It caused me severe allergic reaction: redness and swollen forehead! Checked the package, the expiration date is 05/15. I&#x27;ve used the same brand Henna many times, never had problems. This is not acceptable to sell expired product and caused allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Nice color. Shiny and dark red</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past but I guess I did not know how to mix it and it left my hair very dry.  However, I recently tried it again and I love it.  My hair was very moisturized and my curls were popping.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering. Love the earthly smell ... easy to mix and use</li>
    <li> This worked really well for me. It was my first time using henna on my hair. I mixed it with water, as the package said. You can use filtered water if you want but I used tap. I poured in a quick splash of coconut oil and let it sit for 3 hrs. Then I put it on my hair, covered it with a shower cap, and waited for another 3 hrs. I rinsed off most of the henna in a bucket of water, and repeated 2 times. Then I put on a hair mask, waited 5 min, washed it off, and followed with conditioner. That took off the remaining henna. I&#x27;m Chinese with brown-black hair, so it tinted my hair slightly red. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel rough.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 2 years. It&#x27;s a bit hassle to use it, but the effect is very good.</li>
    <li> Good hair dye color! Smell like herbs but okay , I can take it. no chemical, love it! I will recommend for friends n family!</li>
    <li> This my first time using this brand. And I must say I love it! I&#x27;ve never used henna with added herbs, and was actually going to get each one seperate and add it too the henna. Whelp no need to do that with this! My hair feels stronger, thicker, and silky. I mixed it with tap water and let sit overnight. Shampooed my hair, added this and let is sit for 4 hours. I&#x27;m in love :-) Left my. Faded black color shine beautifully with a reddish/brownish color. Something like a nice chocolate brown.</li>
    <li> My wife has used other henna products and she really likes this one. Good product at a good price.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product after reading all the excellent feedbac, unforunately, I had a completely different result.  I followed the directions carefully and what I got in return was coarse, brittle hair that broke.  It has been months later and my hair has not returned to normal.  I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The first use was definitely a shocker. Was not expecting such a brilliant red. But now I&#x27;ve adjusted and am enjoying the color. I find that right after using, my hair feels rough to the touch. So I use a leave-in conditioner and that restores my hair to a soft feel.</li>
    <li> Being a middle easter I know how real henna smells and looks. I have triad a few supposedly natural henna without additives and they were nothing near natural pure henna. This one, however, is! The only thing I noticed different was that it didn&#x27;t have that strong smell the henna I know has -which is a bonus, of course! Great packaging and a price that you can&#x27;t beat for the amount you get! I&#x27;ll continue purchasing!</li>
    <li> This is my regular brand so I know it works and it&#x27;s from this harvest year so I know it&#x27;s good. Great price. Fast Ship! I&#x27;m happy &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Great purchase.  This product works well to cover my grey before I add Indigo Powder.  The combination makes for a natural looking black hair.  Plus its healthy!</li>
    <li> Great product! Made my dark brown hair a beautiful dark auburn. It is especially red in the sun! For long hair, I put 12 tablespoons of Henna and mixed it with a cup of warm water, olive oil, and fresh lemon juice. I left it in my hair for 6 hours, and it was very easy to rinse out. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants their hair colored in a natural way!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how fast this came! It came 4 days after I ordered it, I was excited beyond all reason. I mixed it up, let it set for 7-8 hours, and applied it using the Indian method, left it on for 4 hours, and rinsed it out, mind you, it took foreveerrrrr to get out! But the color was a nice burgundy, and I had previously lightened my hair with lemon and baking soda so my hair was like a golden blonde, and it made it a nice auburn on the blonde part and a nice deep burgundy. It made my hair feel imediatly thicker but also dry as I don&#x27;t know what, but I&#x27;ve done my research and I knew it would be dry so I just whipped up a deep conditioner and we are all set. :D I recommend this to anyone whos looking for a natural way to dye their hair! :D</li>
    <li> Awesome! Really  good quality product!</li>
    <li> I totally love this brand.  I&#x27;ve tried 3 other brands, just pure henna.&lt;br /&gt;But this one has a mixture of some wonderful herbs.&lt;br /&gt;What I really liked about it was that it washed out easier than the other henna products I used.&lt;br /&gt;It might be because I added 1 tbsp of coconut oil to the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color.  It covered my gray hairs nicely and I left it on for only 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually get that great coverage with the other brand.&lt;br /&gt;I also did not mix it with lemon juice this time, or leave it to stand overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it like the bag said, with water.&lt;br /&gt;added some coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;Left it to sit for 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Then put it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did make my hair feel harsh after rinsing it off,&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m used to that, henna will do that.&lt;br /&gt;But, after one washing and some conditioner,&lt;br /&gt;That coarse hair feeling went away.&lt;br /&gt;Mine already did, it&#x27;s only been a day.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention it left my gray hairs a beautiful red/brown color.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color it makes when it glistens in the sun.</li>
    <li> I continue to use this brand. I have modified a few things. I now mix it in a glass bowl. I add more AMLA. I make it more like a mash potato mixture. I add cinnamon or nutmeg to cut out the grassy smell. I only use water. I now put it on my hair when it is wet or moist. By adding more AMLA, the orange tone seems to soften to be orangy on me. So, now I have not been doing the second step of putting indigo on it unless I want it black. So, to use the indigo, I would NOT put it in with the henna, I mix it separately and put it on after the henna is rinsed out. I would leave the indigo paste on for another 2 hours. But, like I said I am just doing AMLA right now to soften the orange tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and have no regrets.  I&#x27;m hispanic with wavy hair. Since using this product my hair has become super soft and smooth. It has even relaxed the wave in my hair. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on how healthy and shiny my hair looks. Before, I had to dye my hair almost every 2 weeks. Now I use this product about once a month.  I do recommend using their &#x27;curd or coconut&#x27; oil to condition. Also, after fully rinsing my hair, I condition it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other suggestions are to put this one after washing your hair, so your hair is moist. Also, a key is getting the right consistency. It should be like pancake batter. After put in in my hair, I wrap my hair with plastic wrap and then a shower cap. That seems to work to keep my hair moist. You don&#x27;t want to let it dry on your hair because it will be like mud which is difficult to rinse out. I do leave it on my hair at least 3 hours. Then, I don&#x27;t shampoo again for 2 days. *Also, one of my friends says she read to add some vinegar to make the color stay longer on your hair. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this seems to be the best price on Amazon from this seller.</li>
    <li> Great product works well on relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I use this since April 2012 .the color pay off is just one of the benefits. I dont use this for color .Based on my friends recommendation i started using this to improve the health of my hair.This has made my hair thicker also improved my hair loss situation.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love healthy, shiny, long auburn hair? This is totally for you then. My current natural hair color ranges from dish water blonde to silvery white. I&#x27;ve been using this hennamix  well over three years. My hair&#x27;s gone from shoulder length down to my waist and that&#x27;s with cutting off about four inches over the same time period. You know those crazy commercials where the woman&#x27;s hair is so glossy ya think it isn&#x27;t real, well it could be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only two drawbacks, one it&#x27;s dark auburn even the areas that may look orange darken in a couple of days. Two, what kind of time commitment you think hair like this is worth. Yes, you do have to leave it on for four hours. But then again how long does it take and how much does it cost and what kind of damage do you get from a Brazilian blow out? The results are similar minus the damage with the added plus of a very natural looking red. I&#x27;ve encountered very few split ends and oh yeah I look for them. I used to be OCD about splits, I&#x27;m not kidding.</li>
    <li> cost effective and it works!  The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant but at least it&#x27;s not chemical and will fade within several shampoos.</li>
    <li> It does make the hair appear healthier. Has a slight straightening affects on my hair. That is one reason I didn&#x27;t use relaxer within 2 to weeks of coloring. The two treatment would have been too much for my fragile hair. But I deep condition 2 days after coloring. Use a leave in conditioner 2 times a week. I like the new texture of my hair. Will be relaxing hair the 1st of the year. A month after my first henna treatment.  The only  negative remark I have is the.color. Too red. Since I like all the other positive results, I&#x27;m going to find a way to tone down the  red.  Any ideas?</li>
    <li> a great product that I will buy again!  I have used this in my conditioner and as a Henna treatment to color my hair. All I can say is the color is great.  My hair loves all of the natural herbs in this product.  I highly recommend Godrej Nupur Natural Mehndi!  I am a natural with very thin fine hair (3b and 3c). I use this sometimes weekly or every other week. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. If you really want color,  keep your mix in your hair all day or night!  It requires more than one treatment for a richer color. The more I use it, the more I love it!</li>
    <li> It is what they adverstise for at website, the delivery came fast. I like this herbal product for my hair it makes it shine, I mix it with cofee, olive oil and water, combine ingredients and let it soak for 5-8 hours and then i appy it in my hair for 4-5 hours, rinse it, next day i shampoo it.</li>
    <li> This mixture makes my hair stronger and cleanse my hair and scalp at the same time.  I have not brought it from Amazon, but buy it for less than $3 at my local Indian store.</li>
    <li> I have almost hip length hair that is wavy and dark brown. I have used this over 6 times and cannot believe the difference.  It makes my hair SHINY, thicker, and gives it a beautiful red tint. My hair is definitely stronger and softer as well.  I have tried various recipes and have found water mixture to be a little drying and too clumpy for my taste. I have tried coconut milk and it was less drying and less clumpy. But I must say, mixing it with cone free conditioner (like Vo5) until it is a little thicker than yogurt in consistency and adding two tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar is the best for my hair. I have read that the apple cider vinegar aids in color release thus enhancing its potential, plus it is conditioning for the hair. I make sure to clarify with mixture of baking soda and water (2 tablespoons of baking soda per cup of water) prior to application. After rinsing the baking soda mixture completely, I towel dry and apply my henna, which will have been sitting for over a day for color release. I apply henna and place plastic wrap over it then a winter cap; this promotes a moist environment that not only aids in the ease of removing the henna after hours of application but also in its absorption.  Henna has transformed my hair. Despite its length, it is healthy from root to tip :)</li>
    <li> soft sweet hair  .. worth the time !!!</li>
    <li> the best henna mix powder in the world</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and works great. Little coffee powder mixed with it gives a less orange and more brown tinge... :-)_&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item reached quickly and item was as described. Highly recommend product and seller.</li>
    <li> I have used this about five times since receiving it a couple months ago and I love it. The bag is huge. The quality of the henna itself is great, I was not looking for a bright red color, and this gave me a nice medium auburn that is brighter in the sun. It also conditioned my hair SO WELL! Prior to using this, my hair was deeply fried and recovering from years of being dyed red with chemical dyes. When my hair was wet it felt like gummy rubber bands, and it was pretty much unbrushable. After letting it recover for a few months, I decided to try henna on the recommendation of a friend. This stuff literally saved my hair! It is so shiny and healthy now, more so than it has ever been in years. I followed the recommendation of another Amazon user and mix the henna with a silicone-free conditioner and two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, then let it sit for a day for the dye to release. Mixing with conditioner makes it a lot easier to spread throughout my hair, and it&#x27;s a lot less drippy and messy. I wrap my head up and go to sleep, then wash it out the next morning (takes me about half an hour to rinse it out using a cheap conditioner). I love the color and the price is great! I have used both this and the Caca Marron henna from Lush and personally I prefer this because it is less grainy and easier to use, so I got a more even color (also it is wayyy cheaper).</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really color that well, on gray hair it makes it BRIGHT red, now what I expected, but luckily I had indigo powder to cover up the very off color.  But on the positive side, it does condition well.  I won&#x27;t order this again, will stick to the Henna Guys stuff.</li>
    <li> Like it, turn my white hair to beautiful gold.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and was doubled packaged.  You could smell the earthly freshness of the herbs.  I mixed it according to the instructions but added a few drops of peppermint and olive oil as an additional conditioner for my dry hair.  I placed several conditioning caps on my head and got under the hair streamer for an hour.  I thoroughly washed it out using a cheap clarifying conditioner and it left my hair soft, hydrated and beautiful.  I would highly recommended this product and will continue to use it on a monthly basis as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> Just FYI: if you buy this product and you do not have really long hair, split up the bag. I have shoulder length hair and wound up wasting about half the bag because I did not realize how much was really in there after it sat in the water for 4 hrs. I could have gotten 4 uses out of this bag otherwise. Also, my hair came out auburn not brown. My sister who does henna said to leave it on your hair over night, just wrap your head and fall asleep with it on. I am too restless to do that but I do think she has a point. I should have started first thing in the morning and let it go all day. Also, she suggested adding cappucino or wine to the mix to get a darker hue. She has black hair and it seems to work for her....</li>
    <li> Delivery came in decent timing and I really like the product. Love how it conditions and softens my hair and ESP love the color results, although it is not the most appealing smell but that is the only minor minor downfall and the smell only lingers a little while in your hair! Can&#x27;t wait until my next hair henna day!</li>
    <li> This comes in a bag and for shoulder-length hair, this package could go on for more than three uses. The directions of use are easy to understand and it&#x27;s always recommended to watch a few YouTube tutorials about henna applications before use. Great product, overall. Will order again after six months.</li>
    <li> I love this henna, i mixed it with tresemme naturals conditioner and a bit of oil, for a henna gloss. I left it on for 4 hours and rinsed with conditioner. I have  tightly curled African- american natural hair and this henna made my hair soft,shiny with a subtle red tint. my curls looked amazing . This henna is great for the price and i will definitely continue to use it in my regimen.</li>
    <li> I have coarse  on  African american hair so I decided to gives  this brand a try after reviewing people reviews and decided on the brand because it has 9 herbs and henna so it worked out get. I did not let it sit overnight like some have done. I took 3 hrs to sit and 4 hours to stay on my hair. I have very pleased with the outcome after letting it air for a while, at first it has not the color i intended to have, i did have some oranges patches for a day or two but after that the henna was great and my hair looked even healthier then before i started the henna treatment. It did looser my curl but ya i can go for that, its way more easier to comb my hair and take way less time now that i started this treatment. I did order a extra bag of this stuff plus there&#x27;s no shipping cost. I get my order pretty darn fast so that&#x27;s another thing that i like.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality product that has given me easy and consistent results.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for a natural hair dye.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and I received it super quick!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the additional ayurvedic herbs added, but I agree with another reviewer who said it was as if the henna was mixed with sand. After one use, my hair appeared thinner, harder, and I used twice as many products to get it to look half way decent. My kinky/coily hair just doesn&#x27;t look or feel the same. I will deep condition every week in the hopes that my hair will return to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid approx $12 for 500 grams. Sometimes you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m switching back to the Jamilla BAQ. My hair loves that stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this particular henna mix, but it seems like this one has really long-lasting color. I usually have to redye once every two weeks with other henna mixes. After the last application of this henna dye, I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in over four weeks. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I use this on my natural, kinky hair and I love it! I mix it with coconut milk instead of water or green tea. It does wonders! Adds moisture and makes my hair nice and fluffy!</li>
    <li> An excellent henna I discovered in Thailand-- so smooth and easy to apply; always a rich red.</li>
    <li> I heard this from one of my friend, she suggested it and I wanted to try it once. The result is more than expected, I got a whole new shiny hair since my is long and getting weaker and weaker.&lt;br /&gt;I would go with it more than just this time. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  It comes with no instructions.  It is vitally important that your learn how to use it before you try it.  Do a search for Henna on youtube and you will find many tutorials. Consider your own hair needs and the fact that everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  For example I have short hair and I only use 1/2 cup at a time mixed with 1/2 cup of conditioner and 1/2 cup of oil such as coconut or olive oil or castor oil. Mix well and let it sit over night to make a thick pudding consistency. Precautions must be taken because it is a dye. After application don a shower cap and plastic bag for three or more hours.  If you use a heat cap or stay under the dryer you can easily cut this time in half.  Rinse in the shower tower dry and add conditioner to your hair, some say it makes their hair dry but this has never happened to me.  It covers my grays with a deep red tint which I love.  The rest of my hair is glossy, thicker and vibrant. The results have a cumulative effect.  You can use this product every week if you want to.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.The price was very good, but the postage was  high. I bought it anyway, because I cannot buy it in my country and love the way it makes my hair look and feel. Plus it is all natural. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, works when mixed with water and water alone if that&#x27;s all you want. Follow instructions on the package (super easy) and you&#x27;re all set. 2+ hours set time, 4+ on your head. Done. and beautiful</li>
    <li> I like my book you are the best</li>
    <li> I love henna in general, it makes my hair healthier and shiny! I do recommend this product for sure :)</li>
    <li> it is good for hair but for add color to the hair I will use another brand. I didnot like to mix with coconut milk I preferer to use green tea or lemon, the color is better with green tea.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Somehow o didnt get any color. Im using henna to give little of orange color to hair since 16, never used chemical stuff, always had beautiful chocolate color and healthy long and shiny hair with that touvh of red. And this one didnt change anything. I mean the hair looks shiny and healthy, it even smells like henna but no color. Idk whats went wrong i had it on my hair around 8 hours. Going to try again in couple months</li>
    <li> Edit: I&#x27;ve since had a bleached out pixie that kept turning green in the pool. I decided one day to go back to this great henna and I did NOT let it sit (mixed w hot tap water and put on right away), kept on 1.5 hours and had a deep copper auburn stain. None of the dreaded traffic cone orange that usually occurs w henna on bleached hair! I will continue to lift my roots and henna over them to maintain this lovely natural looking red :) doesn&#x27;t fade or turn green in pool now. I&#x27;m happy. Photo is henna, mixed and put on immediately, 1.5 hour application on pale bleached hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve paid for the expensive stuff at henna for hair and Sooq and sorry but this stuff is just as potent, has other beneficial herbs and is a FRACTION of the price! It&#x27;s fresh and in a great big bag. Store it safely in the freezer. 1/2 dry cup mixed w water covers my shaggy pixie very generously. Anything acidic like vinegar (which stinks btw) and lemon dries my hair; I get optimal results w tap water. Stir in water, let sit 5 hours, apply for 3-4 hours, and you&#x27;re set with glorious auburn locks! Rinse out easy with conditioner :)</li>
    <li> I have 4a, natural hair and started using henna at the end of last month. So far, I am definitely a fan! The Nupur brand is reputable and the price is excellent for the amount of product you receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m using it for conditioning and strengthening, not for color and so far it seems to be working. I was suffering from moderate breakage and after a good trim, wanted to strengthen my hair against future breakage. As far as the color goes, I recently noticed that indeed, there is a reddish tint to my hair in certain light. In spite of this, I will continue to use the henna indefinitely and will correct the reddish tint with indigo every 3-4 months as needed. I want to keep my hair jet black!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, there does seem to be less breakage as well as fewer split ends. What I didn&#x27;t expect was the dramatic reduction in shedding or the change in my curl pattern. I probably get 1/3 of the shedding I used to get! And, even though I knew it could happen, I didn&#x27;t expect that my curl pattern would actually change. Well, it did. There is a noticeable loosening of my curl pattern, even on shrunken, air-dried hair. So far this is not really a problem, but hopefully the pattern won&#x27;t continue to loosen with future treatments. As far as rinsing the henna out, yes, it can be time consuming and messy. But, I noticed that if I divide my hair into quadrants, it rinses out MUCH faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out, however the first treatment left it feeling a little more coarse than usual. A deep, moisturizing conditioner helped with that. The second treatment left my hair feeling soft, strong and fabulous, even before the  moisturizing conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, the henna strengthens my hair, reduces shedding and increases moisture retention. If you have the patience, a pair of rubber (or latex) gloves, an old shirt and towel, as well as a few free hours on the weekend, I&#x27;d say henna is definitely worth a try! I will be using it once a month.will be using it once a month.</li>
    <li> Stronger hair beautiful color I have used this brand for a year work good on my hair</li>
    <li> This brand really, really works for me (but you should know a few tricks).  4 stars and not 5 because I really wish they&#x27;d figure out a way to make the dye release faster, and with less trapped body heat (note: this dye did not work for me when I didn&#x27;t use a plastic shower cap).  A couple of tips:  1) let the henna-water mixture sit out for a few hours to release dye (or one hour if you&#x27;re using henna-coconut milk as your mix - HIGHLY recommend that approach because it makes henna really easy to wash out).  2) wrap your hair in plastic after putting the stuff on, and put a hat on over that.  I use a shower cap and baseball hat if I&#x27;m awake when I&#x27;m letting the dye sit.  the heat trapped in the plastic is critical to making the henna release.  the plastic makes your head feel awful after ~6 hours, though; so I put mine on before I go to sleep in a shower cap.  I lay a towel down on my pillow to prevent any staining.  I mix mine with indigo (after letting it sit out) to keep the red color more of a cherry wood color, not as much an auburn or orange color.  I switched to henna after using commercial dyes because I noticed my hair was rapidly losing its thickness with the dyes (it scared me to look at the shower drain after washing my hair).  My hair grows quickly, so I had to dye every 2 /3 weeks to keep up with my roots using chemical dyes.  It was too much for my scalp to take.  After using this product, my hair is much stronger and I&#x27;ve been having very little hair fall.  I wish the application process was faster, but it&#x27;s really not too bad if you sleep in the henna + shower cap.  If this process is what it takes to protect my scalp from harsh dyes, then so be it.</li>
    <li> fast delivery and I love the products.</li>
    <li> I like this natural hair powder! It made my hair silky and darker.&lt;br /&gt;But it made my scalp a little yellow and it is hard to clean up.</li>
    <li> Always used this product &amp; it works great</li>
    <li> Works great! My hair is very gray. Gave me auburn and is shiny. Also, lasts long.I have been using it for two years.</li>
    <li> This is the first henna I try w/o the irritating salt and it was great. Unlike the other henna you do have to let it sit for at least 3-5 hours and leave on for 3-5 hours but is the real thing. Next time I&#x27;ll leave it in for 7 hours to get a radical red, this time I used it for 4 hours and it covered my grays completely.</li>
    <li> Great conditioning product. It cleanses my hair. It does leave it dry and I have to condition it afterwards but I will incorporate it in my hair regimen. It colored my gray hair a red orangish tint which is great, it gives me highlights. It is a great way to see if the indian herbs works on yoru hair and for me it did. I am natural and have kinky curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have long curly dark hair, almost to my waist. I was told to use 500 grams for waist length hair but even sharing the mixture with a shoulder length friend we have enough for at least one more application between the both of us. There definitely is a lot of henna in this package.&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells strongly of herbal tea (I mix with herbal tea and not water or coconut milk) but I&#x27;ve heard other people hate the smell. I&#x27;ve tried it twice before and it makes your hair super shiny and strong. It has a slight tint of red to it in the light but I didn&#x27;t expect too dramatic of an effect due to my dark hair. Henna doesn&#x27;t lighten your hair, it just dyes it. This is the first brand of henna that I&#x27;ve tried but I think its a good one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this product. I have brown hair with a fair amount of grey. After using this the grey hair is a blondish-reddish color (at first it was a more brilliant red, but after a week has faded a bit) and the rest of my hair seems darker. I really like the color the grey turned into. My hair is lush and shinny and I love this product!</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule and makes my hair feel soft and strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those saying that the bags were expired, I believe you&#x27;re mistaken. The date on the bag is the date that the henna was packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those with curly or coarse hair should try mixing the henna powder with coconut milk and a bit of oil instead of green tea. It makes application less messy and rinsing is a breeze! Plus, coconut milk is great for dry hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, my hair loves it!</li>
    <li> THIS BY FAR IS THE BEST ESPECIALLY FOR GREY OR WHITE! ITS A GINGERISH, RED COLOR IF NOT LEFT IN LONG ENOUGH. I HAVE A FEW WHITE HAIRS AND I LEFT IT IN FOR 24HRS AND ADDED A HALF A CUP OF THE INDIGO, AND WHITE HAIRS WERE DEEPLY TINTED IN A BEAUTIFUL RED, AND THE DARK BROWN COLOR LOOKS THE SAME UNLESS THE SUN HITS IT. THEN ITS A BRILLIANT RED. IT VARIES BETWEEN, DEEP RED/MAROON WITH A DASH OR ORANGE, TO DEEP AUBURN ORANGE-ISH. EITHER WAY IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THE COLOR STAYED.FOR BEST RESULTS U SHOULD KEEP IT ON FOR 24HRS ADD INDIGO FOR DARKER, SUBTLER RED RESULTS. OH YES...DO NOT EVER BUY THE &amp;#34;RAINBOW BRAND HENNA&amp;#34; I ADDED A PHOTO ...IT WAS HORRIBLE AND THE CONSISTENCY OF MUD, SAND AND DIRT AND YOU DONT GET VIBRANT COLORS NOR DOES IT COME OUT YOUR HAIR EASILY....CLUMPS OF MUD IN THE SHOWER :(</li>
    <li> It is a nice smooth consistency. I let mine sit for 3 days before using it. Don&#x27;t leave it on to long if you already have dry hair.</li>
    <li> Bag was from afresh lot; wish the bag was resealable.will buy again; quality product which the wife was happy with.</li>
