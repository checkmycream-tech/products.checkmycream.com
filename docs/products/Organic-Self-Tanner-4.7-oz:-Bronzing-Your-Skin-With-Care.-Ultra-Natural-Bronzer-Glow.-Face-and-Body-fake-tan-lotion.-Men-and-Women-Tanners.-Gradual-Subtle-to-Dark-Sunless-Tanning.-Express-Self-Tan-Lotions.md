<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t get my free manual.</li>
    <li> I mix with my body oil, smooth it on and mix with my night facial treatment and smooth on. Next MORNING, I have the sun in a bottle tan that looks like I spent the day in my garden MIDSUMMER.</li>
    <li> I did not get a free manual. Liars!</li>
    <li> After reading many of the good reviews and seeing this product was organic I was hopeful. I applied the lotion per the directions and made sure I rubbed it in evenly as I was super nervous about it leaving streaks. It does not look like the product did anything anywhere on my body other than the lower part of my left leg (per picture). It looks so horrible I will not be able to wear shorts or capris until it is gone. I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong or my skin doesn&#x27;t take well to self tanners but either way i won&#x27;t be using it again :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positives I found so far is the lotion smells great and goes on smooth and not sticky. As for the tanner aspect of it I am very dissapounted.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and worked the very 1st time I used it.  I have an olive skin tone and it compliments it well.  Everyone I came across in my job thought I went away on vacation for the weekend, lol.  I love this product and will be purchasing again soon!!!</li>
    <li> I have found the amount you get for 28.00 is not very much,I have been using a product called fake and bake and it last a lot longer. I love your product but kinda expensive.</li>
    <li> Got the lotion but NO book came with it. Hopefully the lotion is as good as it says. Got here in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Really nice self tanner.  Best I&#x27;ve tried and results after first application.  I was really pleased that it didn&#x27;t stain my clothes.  Great purchase and I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have tried every kind out there. It goes on so easy like lotion, and smells amazing. True to it&#x27;s description, it does NOT leave streaks, or stains on fabric after application. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! Definitely using this all year :)</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s just say that I burn and then MAYBE tan (after maybe having 2nd degree burns). This works really, really well. I don&#x27;t think the color is very orangey and can pass for natural. It really did make a difference overnight. How could I tell? I had a bandaid on my leg and the next morning I had a big white spot. Yup. I used it two days in a row and I don&#x27;t plan to use it again for a few days, as my legs are now significantly darker than my arms. Again, I&#x27;m pale as sh*t so I don&#x27;t want to go overboard. I think one day would have been enough just to give me a little bit of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m only using this on my legs - which makes me look kind of weird, but whatever. My legs are the things that never, ever tan anyway. The lotion itself doesn&#x27;t smell bad and is even pleasant, but you do get a whiff of some &amp;#34;aftersmell&amp;#34; the day following use. It&#x27;s nothing like the other self-tanners though and it&#x27;s subtle enough that you aren&#x27;t paranoid about other people smelling you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning: DO wash and scrub your hands AND arms when done applying. I apparently smudged my leg with my wrist, failed to wash that area well, and there was a streak the next day. And, as they advertise, it&#x27;s certainly not a dye that you can wash off. I even tried acetone, haha. It&#x27;s been 3 days since this happened and my wrist is mostly clear now, though I can still see the streak very faintly. No one else would notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the texture is just like regular lotion so I didn&#x27;t feel compelled to waddle around for hours, trying to avoid streaks. Pretty sure that this is the solution for a quick tan, and I doubt I will ever purchase any other self-tanner again. This sh*t is legit.</li>
    <li> I like that the tan lasts for days!! Just wash your hands right after application and you are all set!!</li>
    <li> This is the first self tanner that I have ever been 100% satisfied with. The color is gorgeous and did not streak up at all. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great color. Looks like a real tan. Doesn&#x27;t smell. It arrived fast. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> First over night application went great. Literally a tan over night. But, it blotches badly after a few days. Reapplying just darkens the blotched parts slightly. Sorta looked like I had skin cancer. Packaging was great though.</li>
    <li> Put on before I went to bed....woke up to some color, used a little on my face before applying my makeup, and could see more color develop as the day went on.....so far, so good!!! I am liking the results....not overwhelming like some self tanners</li>
    <li> High quality product.  Met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> This definitely gives a more natural color than a lot of self tanners I have tried. It doesn&#x27;t streak, and if it has splotches it is because I was too lazy to rub it in all the way. It is scentless going on but it definitely smells like every other tanning lotion I have tried after application, but maybe it is just how it smells with my body scent. More affordable than spray tan, but also a little more upkeep. All in all, if I am going to buy a self tanner, this would be top of my list. I still have one other brand I want to try before re-ordering.</li>
    <li> When you could use a little extra color without turning yellow this product  does the job. Very subtle but effective.</li>
    <li> It works amazing! I got so many compliments, but when i got the package, there was lotion everywhere because they either didn&#x27;t close it or it got bumped around.</li>
    <li> This is the most natural looking.</li>
    <li> PERFECT! Bought a Sally Hansen self tanner that wasn&#x27;t doing the job, and was pricey! For a few dollars more you could get longer lasting results, and a natural product! Once I run out I will be purchasing more, thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to say it&#x27;s the best self tanning lotion I have ever used !! I highly recommend it it works! it does not leave  any product on your clothes  I use it straight after I get out of the shower or in the evening before I go to bed and it&#x27;s great because I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting all over my sheets all over my clothes don&#x27;t have to worry about throwing things away.</li>
    <li> turned me orange.  no different from the ones that i have tried before, same smell.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this lotion once &amp; won&#x27;t order it again. I figured with it being organic it would smell better. A lot of sunless tanners smell bad, this one is the stinkiest, strongest smelling tanning lotion ever. Smelled like urine after about 3 hours &amp; then for days after &amp; showering &amp; using scented lotions &amp; perfume. I even mixed it with scented lotion right before applying as I usually do, to prevent streaking. I had to wash my sheets after 3 days. Horrible!</li>
    <li> This self tanner is super easy to use.  No streaks, no orange coloring.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works great; long lasting natural color, goes on easy without streaks.  Equally great; this company is concerned that you know how to use their product and are happy with the results.  Have no doubts about buying this self tanner.</li>
    <li> Great Product, worked exactly as described! Very happy!</li>
    <li> If this is Americas Best Organic it will be my last. Definitely an orange hue to this tanner. Tried two applications then threw it away.</li>
    <li> I have only used for one week..so far it is super..I have purchased 2 more I have tried at least 8 different tanners  YOURS IS THE BEST1Not only that but your personal employees are also SUPER1  I get tons of  compliments!!  Clif Kappedahl</li>
    <li> I am really tan and its December!  I love it because its organic and much more natural than other self tanner products</li>
    <li> Dries quickly/immediately.  No smell.  Did not get me as &#x27;tan&#x27; as I had hoped, but for the money, it delivers.</li>
    <li> Love it! Easy to use. Smells nice. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This product gives a very slight color which is okay for the winter if your just looking to even out completion. The guide was NOT included so I had no idea how to apply and it get the best results. I also found the day after I received my order this same product was on sale here for half the price I paid. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> love the way it makes me look awesome</li>
    <li> So far I like this stuff. It needs to be layered so it isn&#x27;t too dark when you initially put it on. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but a little goes a long way. I use it about every other day until I get the color I want, then about twice a week. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet, but it seems to work nicely and leave an even tan on my body. Also, because it isn&#x27;t that dark it doesn&#x27;t turn my fingers and hands brown. I have used other tanners that were much darker and I tend to like that, but even after scrubbing my hands they were still brown around the cuticles. I don&#x27;t seem to have that same problem with this.</li>
    <li> Love this self tanner. It blends great. No streaks. The color is so natural. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivary but i order for one itam then it shows dicline then i order another now i have two i hope its work like good</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! Really does build up a tan! I tried a few other brands like Alba and maybe I used them wrong but the results weren&#x27;t as good as with this product. Also great customer service and guide that comes with the product!</li>
    <li> Not as good as Zia but I can&#x27;t find that anymore! It&#x27;s nice to find a self tanner that doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer in it. Sometimes you just want to be able to put a tan on without the brown mess. This is a pretty good color. I&#x27;d like it to be darker but it&#x27;s not super light like those gradual kind. And it smells nice too. I use this along with Fake Bake.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I mix it with my normal lotion and use it probably 3 days a week. It has kept me with a slight tan as the weather has moved from summer to winter. I didn&#x27;t want to look like I had just come back from a week in Hawaii all winter long, but I wanted to stay not looking like a ghost! So far this product has worked to do that in the way I&#x27;ve been using it. I have had no problems with my palms, elbows, or knees changing colors/looking unnatural. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I always have to be tan!! I gave up tanning beds a while back and usually use a self tanner with instant color. I decided to try this one during the winter months just to keep a bit of color. This is what it gives you ....a bit of color.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is not loaded down with chemicals was a HUGE plus for me. I do like it, but I dont think I would use it solely  during the summer months when I like a deep bronze tan.</li>
    <li> Nice color. Lasting. Very natural. I have enjoyed using the product. My latest bottles have decreased in product from 6 fl oz to 4.7.  So sorry. I&#x27;ll find something just as good.</li>
    <li> I have a very natural looking tan and it doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is so easy to use and I love that it has such a light scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. The tan is believable too, no streaks and no orange.</li>
    <li> I ordered the self tan and  the ulti-mitt  but never recieved the bonus booklet. I need to reorder but looking for new kind. All the tanners I try start fading &amp; leave the spoty look on my skin. THE tan never looks as good as the pics. Any suggestions what brand I should try?? I dont think ill waste my money again but can say I loved the mit cant comment on book( never recieved), but I will say  tanner  is better than store bought.. But bottle dont last long &amp; I didn&#x27;t use everyday. CEPT in begining still would&#x27;ve went through bottle within werk just to get base going. Im a small chic too.</li>
    <li> Best customer service and follow-up I have EVER experienced! Was sent &amp;#34;old stock&amp;#34;; unwrapped, old label that looked like it had seen better days. Emailed company and they QUICKLY sent out another, new label one. LOVE the product! I am a fair redhead and I feel like I look 5-8 years younger and healthier. NON-OILY or greasy! Quickly absorbs. Wonderful! I hardly need to use any foundation. Love the health consciousness of the company (please, don&#x27;t ever compromise). Tropical Traditions makes a great moisturizer that I put on over this a couple of minutes after it has had a chance to be absorbed in. I&#x27;m calling my daughter now to see if I can send her some.</li>
    <li> This product has a natural looking color, but it smells really strong.  I have used a bunch of different sunless tanners in the past and this one has the strongest sunless tanner smell.  The color is waterproof and lasts almost through a week of showering. If you miss a spot or do not coat evenly you will pay.</li>
    <li> Thermalabs is great... It&#x27;s true. Try it and you will be more than impressed.</li>
    <li> To start off, I have very pale skin. I&#x27;ve tried all different self tanning products from Victoria secret, Jergens, mysterious hemp lotion, tea bags, and coco powder. My biggest complaints were always streakiness, smell, and the lasting effects.&lt;br /&gt;This tanning product from thermalabs struck my interest when I figured out it was organic.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the lotion is awesome. Very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;There is an unpleasant after-scent the next day but very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;Minimal streaking.&lt;br /&gt;Can reach desired tan with different applications.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a few days since last applying and my tan still looks just as good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was darker from application to application.&lt;br /&gt;A little difficult to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is my favorite self tanner lotion! It&#x27;s the closest to a spray tan without the horrible smell or bad chemicals. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a pretty tan without worrying about the sun or uv beds.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about self tanning lotion at first. My skin was pretty pale, But after one use I had a good amount of color. My legs look like I&#x27;ve been on the beach and I haven&#x27;t been in the sun at all. Thanks. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a tanning bed user on and off for the past few years, I tan pretty easily, but I decided I care about my skin and bought this lotion and quit my tanning membership. And I gotta say this is a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! I Love it</li>
    <li> did not see any results not worth the price</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t even leave any color. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great transaction and product! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> The lotion goes on nicely and gives a natural color.  I find I need to re-apply every two to three days to keep the color.</li>
    <li> do not like this stuff</li>
    <li> I usually steer away from self tanning products because I&#x27;m fair skinned and they usually turn my skin that icky orange color but this leaves a beautiful natural golden glow. It doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. Just make sure you put a little bit of moisturizing lotion on your knees and ankles and other dry spots before you apply it.  At first I just put it on the unexposed areas, but after a day I decided to put it everywhere and I don&#x27;t regret it - takes pasty white skin to natural lovely tan easily and efficiently.Fades naturally too - no weird streaks and blotches! After you finish your body, wash your hands very well with soap and a nail brush. Baking soda works well for day old stains. The best part is the color and the fact it has a ton of great natural and organic ingredients in it to take care of your skin! I would have given this product 5 stars but the pictures are a little misleading because it takes more than one overnight application to build a deep tan at least that was from my experience.</li>
    <li> This lotion is magic! I&#x27;ll continue using it all year to keep color. Have expounded to everyone about the great product and wonderful company!</li>
    <li> It works great, no streaks, no bad smell and blends evenly with the tone of your skin. I love this product.</li>
    <li> best tanner I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle for evaluation. I have always been very fair skinned,...I burn, peel, and freckle. Some of the older types of self tanners would turn my skin horribly orange and were hard to blend, leaving streaks and splotches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tanner is a nice creamy lotion that applies easily and absorbs very well. A little over a week ago I decided to give some of it a try and put a smallish (so I thought) dot on my fingertip. I didn&#x27;t want to go all out yet in case this tanner did turn me orange, so I decided I would do just one small test spot on the inside of my foot. I drew a small circle on my foot next to my arch and did notice that it absorbed very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few hours later while I was watching TV I looked down at my foot and saw it was already getting a bit of color, but I could barely see it so I forgot about it. The next day, around midmorning, I remembered about the circle of tanner I applied the night before and looked down at my foot. OMG,...there was this really big tan circle on my foot. O.O  It was much darker than I thought it would be, and not quite as small of a test circle as I thought I had applied.  I thought it would have turned out to be a light base tan that could be built up darker as needed until reaching the desired shade, but instead it was a rich, golden brown spot, highly visibly on the side of my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tanning lotion tans quickly, and on my skin provided quite a bit of color. One thing I did notice was that it will also color any sun spots or moles a shade or two darker than the rest of the surrounding skin, so if you decide to use this on your face keep this in mind when applying and make sure you wipe off any lotion from areas that you wouldn&#x27;t want to darken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week and my foot&#x27;s Spot-O-Color is still with me. It is just now starting to fade some. I have noticed that the edges are a bit darker, I think if applying this all over, using a dark colored towel or makeup sponge to lightly blend would keep everything nicely even. And make sure you wash your hands and arms very well after applying so you can be sure you haven&#x27;t accidentally gotten any of the tanning lotion where you didn&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tanning lotion works well, is streak free if applied carefully, and really does last quite a long time.ould keep everything nicely even.

    <li> Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you stinky or streaky and you literally see results in hours and it last for days.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used a few lotions before, but they were either a spray that&#x27;s hard to control an even spread, or a lotion that leaves streaks or makes you look like you ate 200lbs of carrots... This lotion is great cause I feel It&#x27;s subtle and i can control how much I put and how tan I want my skin to look. The first time i didn&#x27;t put too much to make sure It didn&#x27;t look like I was in Florida for 2 weeks...but when I saw it&#x27;s really subtle, I did another layer the day after, so it&#x27;s really nice that you can really control the results and not just buy a certain shade like other products. Even the color of the lotion itself is white and not brown like others. The lotion itself feels silky on your skin and I LOVE that it&#x27;s organic and Made in the USA!!! I just know I can trust the quality and materials and not have some unknown ingredients in it....</li>
    <li> boy well i got the wipes remember we talked about just how much i loved them? i  thought for sure after getting them and using them that it would be my one and only tanner love until i was sent this! Now you all know i look so white because of not being able to go out in the sun, well lately i was using the wipes so i looked like i was in the sun and outside however it wasn&#x27;t dark enough so i decided to use this as soon as it came in! as you can see from my picture what a difference a day makes! no more deadly white skin! no orange hands and no streaks and yes no foundation nothing that is my bare skin! ( and my cap i use when i oil my hair lol) i&#x27;m thinking of going more darker so i may add more today and let it deepen but it doesnt come off for 2 weeks! can you believe it 2 weeks! and it doesnt have that nasty sickening sweet smell like normal sun tanning lotions do so your man can use this too! no more harmful rays of the sun sound good to me and i dont have to look deadly white anymore, what else can i say? I have used the walmart brands of tanner which give that slight color, i dont know what they mean by slight but if it is non existent then yeah, but if i am going to spend money and not waste it why would i want something that isnt going to work? so of course i saw it on tomoson.com decided to try the wipes which of course i was approved and they were amazing then i wasnt approved for this, not enough viewers apparently on my twitter and facebook but i took a chance and messaged thermalabs and the reply i got made my jaw hit the floor, knowing i dont pay for products i review i dont see it being fair if i have to review a product for any company that i have to pay for that&#x27;s not how i do things, so they knew and offered me a chance to try it out, didnt even bother to mark me as approved or shipped just said here if you like the wipes try this, I was really expecting a flop like the one from walmart, boy did i get fooled!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;tion was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have used this product twice and I&#x27;m happy with it. I did not received the bonus &amp;#34;Self tan secrets&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am a diehard self tanner after being banned from tanning beds due to a bad car accident, and too high levels of radiation. Doctors told me no more tanning beds!? this was 3 years ago im pasty, I was devastated needless to say despereate, I love the natural idea,it smells nice. There is no TAN though??? its like jergens lightest tan lotion but less of a tan... Trust me I tried everything. For the price I was very disappointed. I rather had stayed with the old faves which are cheaper than trying this with high hopes bc the price:(</li>
    <li> I have always hated the streaks you get from self-tanners and was hoping this would be better. I used the mitt and applied as directed. There was still some streaking on my legs and even after several applications it was a very light color. When I put the second coat lightly on my feet with the rest of my body my feet got really dark with quite a contrast! I did like the mitt though.</li>
    <li> This works overnight and doesn&#x27;t looks fake whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been really nervous about buying self tanners, but this has to be one of the best ones in my opinion! It eventually just becomes a part of your nightly routine every other night, and if you apply it right and rub it in enough, you get this really nice, even looking tan. It doesn&#x27;t really work for your face though, but it works wonders for the rest of your body!</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! Super natural..no streaks!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used countless self tanning products. Most of them are the same, but I thought I would give this one a try. However, it left my legs completely streaked. Unfortunately my legs looked like a zebra for our vacation. I will say though, the solution does last, because I couldn&#x27;t get it off for over a week.</li>
    <li> I am a harsh critic and I have a tendency to hate most products but I love this natural self tanner! After the first use I looked tan, not orange! And it left my skin feeling super soft. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> So far I love this stuff!! Works really well and has given me just that little extra color that I was needing!  There is a little smell to it but it fades fast.</li>
    <li> Good quality &amp; speedy dekivery</li>
    <li> This may work for some, but definitely not for a very fair person.  It turned my skin orange and was patchy and spotted.  Won&#x27;t use again.  It may work well with darker skin or skin that is already tanned.</li>
    <li> The title and description of this product states that it comes with a tanning guide. I only received the bottle of product and a flyer advertising the guide. Haven&#x27;t tried the product yet.</li>
    <li> AAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++EXCELLENT!!!!! Does not rub off on clothes!!</li>
    <li> The absolute worst self tanner I have ever tried!!!  Way too dark and streaky and won&#x27;t come off.  Smells bad too!!  U will be very sorry if U buy this product.</li>
    <li> Provides a nice even tan &amp; especially love the fact that its full of organic ingredients!!</li>
    <li> For me, it is just okay.  No better, nor worse than some of the products on your nearby store shelf.  Like Jergen&#x27;s Glow.  I am allergic to the sun so I&#x27;ve tried my share of self tanners to being spray painted as the newcomers arrive. More than three coats, I became orange.  It still transfers the color like all self tanners to my bed sheets, my under garments, at the straps and the inside of your clothes at all seams...you know, where it would rub. Yes, I let my body air dry...and surely I must be dry by the time I go to bed after morning applications.  Maybe it sweats off with your natural body oils.  I had no issues with streaks or blotching.  I use thin latex gloves. I think it is over priced. And the packing..it was just rolling around with  my other items I bought, a twenty pound electric roaster, 3 pound bag of apple wood chips so the bottle came open...no cap to stop the nozzle from turning, so some oozed out. Amazon offered another if I&#x27;d sent it back I would get another.  I declined...hassle because I used prime shipping so I could use it that day.  I was a bit irritated..mislead when I bought it as they displayed a bonus book..a book, not an e-file you&#x27;d receive. But now I see they&#x27;ve update their wording in their product summary and stress it is an email bonus book. They send email after email saying you have to give them your email address as they are going through Amazon as a merchant and they do not have access to that and to write a review to receive free offers. I didn&#x27;t give up my email and blocked them as SPAM.  Would I buy it again...yes, for 12 dollars.</li>
    <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used BY FAR!!! I&#x27;m an Irish, white, freckly gal with melanoma history.  The smell is 100x better than any fake tanner I&#x27;ve ever used (which are many)...anyone who complains about the smell is just ridiculously picky and unrealistic about fake tanning.  The brown color is perfect and I was shocked the next day to see my tan...after ONE application.  NO streaks, spreads easily.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough...  Thank God for this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I do like the natural color this gives off you can get some streaking it does take a while but the color is awesome</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product and customer service.</li>
    <li> *Item Received Without Cost For Purpose of Evaluation and Review*&lt;br /&gt;The skin color I achieved with Thermalabs Organic Self Tanner is most definitely &amp;#34;sun kissed&amp;#34; and not orange at all. I haven&#x27;t had a tan in a year but have a light olive completion. The product is good for that glow and light tan but you may have to have help if looking for a total body tan. I found it impossible to apply evenly to my back and ended up slightly odd looking. I like that it is light enough to not leave dark lines and streaks but it will tan your palms. The product is really good, the applicator (Me) not so much. It&#x27;s too hard to get even, full coverage by myself. It would be awesome for pictures where you are just doing your face and upper body.&lt;br /&gt;The cream spread nicely and the product has a pleasant scent. I did not find it irritating at all.</li>
    <li> I think the best thing about this product is that there is no nasty, strong fake tanner scent to it. I found it super easy to apply. No streaking unless you  miss spots. The color is not orangey at all. This gives you a nice tan after a few hours. Make sure to wash your hands after applying so your hands do not tan where they shouldn&#x27;t. This is the second product from this company and I have loved both products that have been sent to me!</li>
    <li> It made me tanner but I had to use many applications to even start to see color. I&#x27;m olive skin tone but I was pretty light this winter and it still took me a while to build up tan. I&#x27;m going to return it because this product caused me so much acne like I have never seen before! Horrible breakout on my face and neck. I rarely get acne my whole life I couldn&#x27;t believe it, I should have listened to other reviewers who experienced this. I&#x27;m trying another product that won&#x27;t do this. The color was nice when it built up and worked but not worth it for me to have giant zits all over.</li>
    <li> Product is effective as it provides an even tan slowly, not overnight, which is more natural than some other products.</li>
    <li> Love the color I get from this product. When applying 2 coats I looked tanned without looking yellow or orange as I have with other products. The only problem I had is that my pump didn&#x27;t work.  But they were kind of enough to send me a working pump.</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best tanning lotion I have used, and believe me I have used a lot since I decided to stay away from tanning beds. After using this one time, I already look like I have started tanning in a bed. No bad odor, no streaks. I think I have found my new best friend as I like to have a tan, especially coming up for spring.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several self tanners over the years - too many to name them all but my favorite had been St Tropez up until this point.  I wanted something with less chemicals so I gave this a try.  I&#x27;ve now used it for several weeks and I really like this one...enough to stop my self tanner search.  I will definitely be purchasing it again.  I haven&#x27;t found a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; self tanner but with a little more practice with this one, it will be very close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;The lotion does NOT have that horrible self tanner smell that all of the others do.&lt;br /&gt;It does not stain my sheets (because it doesn&#x27;t have a bronzer in it)&lt;br /&gt;It produces a believable tan.  (I have naturally pale/light skin. There is a noticeable tan after the first application and it&#x27;s buildable.  I usually apply it two nights in a row and do not have to reapply for a week.  I exfoliate the day I use this though.  Exfoliating afterwards will remove the tan more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This one does NOT give me a headache like many other ones I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s likely the fragrance the others use to hide the tanner smell but this one doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell.&lt;br /&gt;It works just as well on my face as it does the rest of my body.  It did not break me out.  I don&#x27;t normally get acne anyway but I do have very sensitive skin (usually I have to go fragrance/random additives free or I get red itchy blotches wherever I apply)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a white lotion without a bronzer so you can&#x27;t see if you&#x27;ve rubbed it in very well which can lead to streaks.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in.  I use gloves so I don&#x27;t have to worry about staining my hands.  It just takes a little work to make sure there are no streaks.  It took me three tries to work out the right technique with this particular lotion - nothing a little baking soda exfoliation couldn&#x27;t remove.&lt;br /&gt;It takes 10-15 minutes to dry but I wake up with my skin feeling moisturized instead of dry, unlike how I feel with some of the fast-dry tanners.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ll never buy a tanning membership again! Love this product!</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanning lotion I have ever purchased and the price is very reasonable, It went on nicely and I ended up with a great natural looking tan</li>
    <li> I like that it is a lotion, but not sure if I am getting much darker, I never received the magazine with it, not sure if I will purchase again</li>
    <li> Color is good, but you must be careful how much of this stuff you lather on.  I tried a light amount on my leg to check it out and was VERY pleased witht he color and almost no odor.  However, once I put it on my upper body, I apparently used too much.  It had a much stronger odor and got much darker than I anticipated.  I am not that fair either.  I do like the color if you don&#x27;t apply too much, not orangy at all.  Just golden and pretty.  However in all honesty, it&#x27;s probably not much different from most self tanners I&#x27;ve tried before.  And it&#x27;s very very thick, so the amount you apply is hard to judge.  Not sure it&#x27;s quite worth $20.</li>
    <li> I really like this sunless tanner. It has a very subtle smell(UNLIKELY all the others I&#x27;ve tried). It doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets. It lasts about a week if you are applying moisturizer daily after your shower. It has a very nice BROWN tint on my very fair skin. No orangey color. This is a huge plus!</li>
    <li> Amazing!  In my search to find more natural products, I came across this gem. I couldn&#x27;t be more excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used sunless tanner to obtain a healthier tan.  What I didn&#x27;t realize is that sunless tanners are full of chemicals that can be harmful to you.  In hindsight, I now know why most of them smell so horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect product.  It glides on easily after a shower, it hasn&#x27;t given me any streaks in the three months of use, and it smells great!  I get so many compliments on my natural looking tan (it&#x27;s winter in Ohio, so a natural tan is hard to find).  I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I put it on once a week after a shower, it soaks in fast and no streaking. Nice color and so much easier than others I have used.</li>
    <li> Great tanner, easy to apply with mitt.</li>
    <li> Feels like lotion when you put it on. I am extremely fair and this gave me a completely natural looking tan. Lasted probably about 5 days. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> You are here: Home / cowgirl daily / 4 Tips for Sun Safety  4 Tips for Sun Safety  June 22, 2015 by Ange · 4 Comments (Edit)  Before I dive into the details of the post, I just have two quick housekeeping items to let you know about.  1 – the hard drive in my laptop had been giving me errors for about two weeks so it’s in getting fixed. This means my posts are being drafted in my iPad, so we’ll blame any weird typos on that.  2 – I did a number in my back moving my old bedroom furniture on Saturday (I injured my back when I was 18, and the pain I’ve experienced is probably the worst it’s been in 10 or 12 years), so I’ve been taking some pretty hefty painkillers while I wait to get in to see my chiropractor. This may also explain some typos in upcoming posts :)  Last week at work I was working on a presentation related to sun safety, and since I know many of us are soaking up the rays at this time of the year, I thought it would be wise to share some of the information as I assume no one really wants skin cancer…  4 TIPS FOR  Cover Up  If you can, wear clothing with a UPF (ultraviolet protection factor) rating. I have a few tops from lululemon with a UPF rating that I will wear if it’s not too hot out and I’ll be running for a long period of time.  Along with UPF clothing, you’ll also want to wear a hat and sunglasses. The hat will help you from getting sun stroke (and your scalp from burning!), and the brim will protect your face from getting too much sun. Sunglasses protect your eyes from the harmful UV rays as well.  a15a8208d99a7af985abd93fadedd8e0  Use Sunscreen  Seriously. Just buy it and use it.  I used to be resistant to sunscreen because my burns fade to a tan but that’s a pretty stupid reason, and I can’t say I’ve ever put get skin cancer on my list of things to do in my life.  While in Nashville, I wore SPF (sun protection factor) 45 or 60 every single day (and applied multiple times a day) and still ended up with a pretty amazing tan.  sunscreen  But here’s the thing, even tanning means you’re doing some damage to your skin, so that’s why wearing a high SPF is super important as it will minimize the damage you’re doing by laying out.  If you have a burn, cover it up and avoid the sun until it’s healed. Don’t try to “even it out” or think that by applying extra sunscreen you’ll be okay.  Sunscreen  Get Checked  Some people are more prone to moles and skin growths than others. Sometimes (but not all the time) the moles and growths can be precancerous. In these cases, you want to get rid of that sucker as soon as possible.  If you even have the slightest worry about a skin growth, call your doctor and get it checked. It’s far better to be told that it’s nothing than to ignore it and have it turn into something.  In May, this article showing what skin cancer looks like, was quite heavily circulated. Just one look scared me into buying SPF 60 for my face.  Fake It  I get it. We all like the bronzed glow a tan gives us, but even tanning causes damage to our skin and can result in skin cancer.  I hate to admit it, but back in the day, I would, on occasion, frequent a tanning booth. I’m so glad I know better!  Instead, I fake it. Self tanners have come a loooong way from Ross’ tan in Friends.  Screen Shot 2014-10-10 at 10.26.48 AM  It can take a while to find the perfect self tanner for you – I have a number of different self tanners in my bathroom (I really don’t like to be pale!) and recently tried out Thermalabs Self Tanner in an attempt to even my legs out from my trip to Nashville.  While I don’t think this tanner is the best I’ve ever used, it’s also better than some of the other options out there. I can’t say I’d purchase this tanner, but I like it well enough to keep using it. I did notice the lotion was difficult to rub in, and it did have that self tanner smell, but I think it’s nearly impossible to get away from that smell.  - See more at: [...]</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner. I tried others but this one seems to last the longest with out smelling horrible, and staining clothing. The customer service is also great.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion.  She said it makes her skin soft all day long as well.</li>
    <li> Super Tanning Lotion! Tan lasted longer than I expected and isn&#x27;t strong smelling. Buy it you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to this and the wipes.  Such a natural glow!  I definitely feel much better when using this product!</li>
    <li> Moving to the Sunshine State created a conundrum for me - I am surrounded my sunshine, I don&#x27;t want any more sun exposure, but I don&#x27;t want to look like a lily-white Northerner. I tried a number of tanning products that all pretty much produced the same result: a streaky, orangey, inconsistent coloring that looked like an elementary school art project gone wrong. I discovered the Thermalabs product one day while scrolling through the Amazon store and being a bargain shopper, was attracted to the free mitt. The product has exceeded all expectations. There is no streaking, the color looks natural and lasts for weeks. Showering does not interfere with the results, and the product does not darken scratches and scars the way other self-tanners do. I would only suggest not using it on your toes as it makes them look muddy. Love, love, love this product!</li>
    <li> Beautiful tan!!  That really does last a while, I think mine lasted a little over a week!  Love it!  thank you!!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me.  Didn&#x27;t even make the slightest amount of difference.</li>
    <li> Love this product! First time using it and I followed the steps to obtain the best tan and it turned out great! Very natural, not orange looking tan. It smells wonderful too! I highly recommend this if you are looking for a healthy way to get that summer tan look! The service was great and I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> love the fact that its organic, and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it turns out a little orange on my extremely white skin.</li>
    <li> I used to fake and bake until I noticed a small patch of rough skin on my face that wouldn&#x27;t go away. Thankfully after about a year of applying coconut oil.to it daily, it&#x27;s disappeared. But I&#x27;m vain and this pasty white boy likes to look tan. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few self-tanners (Neutrogena is pretty decent) but this is by far the best. I used it for the first time last night and was impressed with the consistency and how easy it was to apply. Plus the smell is pleasant and not overwhelming. It dried fairly quickly, although it did still feel a bit sticky when I went to bed.  Fast-forward to this morning. After I got out of the shower I was very pleased with the color. A very nice glow, totally even and natural-looking. I look like I spent an afternoon in the sun. I have yet to find out how long it will last and how evenly it will fade, but so far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Seems ok, still learning best way to apply lotion.  I find it was helpful to download guidance booklet.</li>
    <li> First of all, the product did not work well at all. Streaky. Second, the &amp;#34;free guide&amp;#34; they promise with the purchase - you have to CALL them to get it. Telemarketing annoyance.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST self tannining lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Easy to apply, dries fast, gave me a natural golden glow. Great customer service, I have received many inquiries as to how I like the product and finally made time to use it.</li>
    <li> Good product. No smell. No streaks</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews online prior to buying and went ahead with this one. Its perfect. No need to explore any further. Literally saw a difference over night and did not stain my sheets.I usually stick to a profesional spray tan artist but each session gets pretty pricey . I can&#x27;t afford that any more.  This is the next best thing. I apply it each night before bed after I shower.  I received lots of compliments too. I&#x27;m set for life.</li>
    <li> Looks like a natural tan!!</li>
    <li> works good for me. no allergy at all.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick and packaged well. For me it works great i get darker each day i have it on which is for two days. I am not putting alot on so that might be the reason its not datk dark like you been tanning for weeks. Maybe you have to put more on to get datker results . However i like gradual darkness it makes it look like your tanning each day. Smells really good and you also can put your clothes on right after it doesnt transfer to your clothes however it absorbs quickly. Also they are no streaks and for knees and elbows i mixed mine with a little lotion so its not darker than the rest of your body. It is also good for the face</li>
    <li> Never received the book, but the product seems pretty great so far.  Natural color, do not dig orange self tanner-gross and does not smell at all.  Gluten free, psoriasis and tons of other allergies and so far zero problems!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I have noticed this prodict has stopped tanning after a week of use, despite taking a break. If anyone has suggestions, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it. Worked very well to begin with though.</li>
    <li> Breaks me out if I put it on my chest but works well on my stomach and legs. Very natural. Not a super dark result but nice.</li>
    <li> This self tanner is the best I have ever bought. Does not look orange like many. I had bought it for a cousins 40th birthday wine tasting and knew it was going to be hot, but didn&#x27;t want to wear shorts unless my legs had some color. So took a gamble and was so pleasantly surprised that all the positive reviews were on point. I would definitely recommend this product! I got so many compliments on my legs and have already forwarded the product info to a few friends that are interested in trying it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product &amp; ive loved having it during my pregnancy due to not being able to handle the heat to tan this summer:)</li>
    <li> I really liked the tanning lotion I got!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other self tanners, but wanted to after being an avid sunbed tanner for a couple decades and developing pre-cancerous growths. I wanted to still have a &amp;#34;healthy glow&amp;#34; but without the sun exposure and chemical ingredients. After much research and reading reviews, this seemed like the best bet and it was! The application is effortless, like putting on lotion. It&#x27;s not streaky or orange, but a nice even bronze-y glow. I will say though (using it twice now), it hasn&#x27;t lasted me a full 2 weeks. It lasts a good week though, which I&#x27;ve read are like most other self tanning lotions. The fact that it looks natural, makes it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, natural tan!!!  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am impressed!&lt;br /&gt;Finally I got my legs tan without the sun!&lt;br /&gt;It never happened with the SUN!</li>
    <li> I just applied it for the first time. I love how it feels, the ingredients u use and the smell!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many self-tanners and they didn&#x27;t work for one reason or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it so far!!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Mostly organic&lt;br /&gt;Goes on streak free&lt;br /&gt;Natural looking color&lt;br /&gt;Stays on for over a week!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t come off in water (pool, shower, sweat...)&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get all streaky and gross when you shave (I&#x27;ve shaved twice with it and it still looks great)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con/Pro: It goes on really thick. The good thing about this is you can see where you&#x27;re putting it. The bad thing about it is it&#x27;s a bit hard to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I LOVE this product. I plan to use it year round.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Have tried many and this one is at the top of the list - Nice color and works really fast!</li>
    <li> This was no better than any other self tanner. I&#x27;ve tried a lot and this one is just fair. Not worth the price, don&#x27;t believe the hype!</li>
    <li> Works great, just make sure to rub it on evenly</li>
    <li> Gives you a nice, even tan. I&#x27;m very pale and worry about tanners being too dark or turning orange on me. I did not have either of those problems with this. I love that it is 99% all natural. Other tanners have harsh and harmful chemicals in them. You will not have an instant tan with this. It will develop over many hours and from what the website says it will continue to develop over a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to exfoliate before applying (for a better application)!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell gross like other self tanners&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I have a problem with (and it&#x27;s not just this tanner) is that inside I look like I have a nice light tan, but outside in natural sunlight I have only some spots that show up as tan and the rest still looks really pale white.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few self tanners with varying degress of satisfaction.  I am very happy with this product.  It goes on smooth, has great color/coverage and smells great (it actually has little scent to it, but the scent it does have is not the stinky typical self tanner smell).  I am very happy with this product and have referred it to others.</li>
    <li> A good self tanner but the bottle is small..I won&#x27;t be a returning customer.</li>
    <li> Went on smoothly, no streaks (which I was concerned about).  There&#x27;s a faint smell, but the scent is like lotion.  Have used it&lt;br /&gt;twice now and can already see great results!</li>
    <li> I am not a big tanning enthusiast but just want a natural look to my legs for summer clothes. While it did take 10 days of every day use to get a light tan on my legs, it does look natural! I find that I must use it pretty much every day to maintain that as well. It&#x27;s really easy to apply - I started using the mitt but have been using my hands the last few days and think the results are better - just wash my hands well after application. The company couldn&#x27;t be better at checking in and offering any assistance you might need. I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great natural buildable color. Drys fast which is important and feels good going on. Best natural organic self tanner on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product all summer. Love it! I can wear shorts and not be self-conscious of my white legs with no skin cancer worries. Purchased it for my daughter and sister. Great product and customer service!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed. This lotion is really no better than Jergens Natural Glow.  You get the same amount of color, but pay 3 times as much.  Additionally, do not attempt to apply without a mitt.  So disappointed.  With all of the fantastic products out there (Fake Bake, Sun Labs, etc.) I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Great self tenner:-)will order again, love it:) thank you!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is actually a great product and smells wonderful, not at all like other tanners but I gave 3 stars for two reasons. 1. The bonus book never would download for me on 3 different computers. 2. The company emailed me many times to say thanks, to say in a few days they would email me tips, to email tips, to ask for a review. It got really got annoying and just spam in my email. One email to say thanks, tips, and to ask for a review wouldn&#x27;t have been annoying but to break it up and to send one just to say they will email in a few days was just too much.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best sunless tanner I have used. This tanner is giving me a natural looking tan. Not yellow or orange honestly a nice sunkiseed look. I am very fair complected but even after the first night I saw a nice base. The tips that the manufacturer sent me also helps never before has anyone taken the time to tell me how to get the best results!! Great product!</li>
    <li> Loved the zero, and I mean zero smell of this self tanner! Wonderful, natural and self building tanner! Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> There awesome! And there product works great. I notice a difference every day and it&#x27;s not orange!</li>
    <li> I love the self tanner.  It is very natural looking.  I use it when I want to wear a dress so that I don&#x27;t have to wear pantyhose.  I does not streak except on my feet when I wear my tennis shoes. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! never leaves me orange, and looks so smooth and amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty on self tanners and this one is one of the smelliest. I showered twice after using it and could still smell it on myself. Much happier with Hemp brand self tanning moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Not tinted. Leaves streaks. Sun laboratories is a superior product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get very tan.  It took several applications to see any change and then when it was wearing off it looked terrible.  Yellow and splotchy.  I probably won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I am happy to say that I love this self tanner!  This is the first time I have purchased and tried this product and I very glad that I did.  The color is great, not too dark where everyone is like hey your tan over night! But dark enough that it gives me a great glow! Also I love that the day after I put it on at night, I can&#x27;t smell it anymore!  Love this tanner and I will be purchasing again. :-)</li>
    <li> This was amazing I love it it&#x27;s easy to use and keeps my skin soft👌💕</li>
    <li> Be VERY careful with this, it will leave streaks like CRAZY if you don&#x27;t apply it well.</li>
    <li> I have used many self tanners and will say this is one of my top 3. It takes a little to rub in to your skin, but it has a great glow and it lasts a long time. The smell is pleasant. I usually shower and exfoliate at night, then apply and wake up to a tan.</li>
    <li> I have used many many self tanners from pharmacy brands to designer and unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work well on my arms and legs regardless of exfoliation.. it did however tan evenly and nicely on my face..the application of this product with the mitt or gloves is a must..if not, your hands will stain and have that &amp;#34;tanning lotion&amp;#34; odor for a few days, even with washing immediately after use..applying this was a lot of work, I think,exfoliation, gloves/mitt,dry time..&lt;br /&gt;Yes,I followed the instructions and</li>
    <li> I just got this last week and have used to every day since.  It starts off with a light glow but builds the more you use it.  I&#x27;ve tried literally every self tanner on the market and this one is AMAZING.  It is super moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t streak, even on ankles, wrists and the back.</li>
    <li> Looking for a product that does not cause rash to my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Sent product back it became more orange on skin then it did tan colorIng</li>
    <li> Bought it because it was &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;. Orange color..smell not bad like some others. You could use it if you have a tan and you want to put a little on to &amp;#34;keep it up&amp;#34;...probably would look OK.  Do not put on winter-white skin! I would return it but not worth the hassle and expense of return. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best self tanner I have used, and I have tried all from the top of the line, to grocery store varieties. I followed the instructions of exfoliating, put lotion on my hells and elbows, and with my bare hands I evenly spread the product over my entire body, including my face.  Be sure to blend well into the hairline or you will have a white mark around your face, and blend over your ears also. I scrubbed my knuckles, fingers and palm, with a nail brush, to remove any extra color.  I finished getting ready for bed and awoke in the morning to a gentle golden glow!  There was no orange, streaking, smell, nor did it come off on my ivory sheets.  My husband was so impressed with how great my legs looked with color, as I am a very pale person.  I used my tinted moisturizer a shade darker and my face looked so natural when I went out that evening. I spend money for facials and good face creams and serums, and I do not want to end up ruining all of my efforts with lying in the sun, and ending up with hyper-pigmentation, and wrinkles. Also, there is a history of skin cancer in my family, and I am not going to fall victim to that.  I also love the mission statement Thermalabs has, if you go to their web-site.  It is a very impressive company and there customer service is personal.</li>
    <li> So far this product is working well for me! It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries quickly. Thermalabs do warn you about dry spots, so be careful when applying in these areas. Takes on to much color, so follow their instructions. It&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> no streaks and great color</li>
    <li> Nothing special. Gave me an orange hue like so many others. Applies nicely but so what. I want brown skin not orangey!</li>
    <li> Product is so so.  Was to come with a book and it didn&#x27;t.  Disappointed. Had streaks.  Special application mitts have to be purchased separately for the product</li>
    <li> Horrible! I&#x27;m officially left with a bottle that&#x27;s had one use, I returned the other unopened bottle. Turned yellow on my skin and hard to see when applying.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for well over a year and I absolutely loved it however I ordered another bottle September 2015 and it smells different and worst of all it breaks my legs out with a itchy dermatitis. Did I get a bad bottle or did you guys change your formula?</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the best sunless tanning lotion I have ever used!!! Love the natural ingredients.  No streaks and it does not come off in the water or when I do hot yoga.  I highly recommend it for an alternative to the sun.</li>
    <li> Works well. Seems to be overall safer than other fake tanners based on the ingredients, although the verdict is still out on the safety of DHA, the active tanning ingredient. It does have a strong smell, similar to other tanners I&#x27;ve used, contrary to other reviews I read before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Bought this before a vacation to Florida. Wanted to get a tan without the tanning bed as it has really taken a toll on my skin. The tan looked very natural and people commented on how good it looked and asked what I used. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Just started using the tan towels and they work great. I don&#x27;t expect to get a deep rich dark brown tan with them alone, I haven&#x27;t come across any self tanners that don&#x27;t leave a slight orangish tinge when appliied heavily without any actual sun tanning assistance. However, I am not very tan and with these towelettes and a little sunbathing I&#x27;m looking pretty darned tan and no orangish glow either!  Even when I&#x27;m super white these towels can take the white edge off and give some nice color without streaking. They don&#x27;t smell horribly strong like many other brands do either. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> WOW is all I can say! I have been searching for a product that actually works, is safe to the skin &amp; ORGANIC…. This stuff is “THE BOMB” I’m done searching! I’m going to the beach with 17 other girls in September &amp; I will be sharing this website with them! Thank you for creating this! I only wish I could be a seller :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mori Welborn</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many self tanners that I&#x27;ve lost count.  This is by far the best I&#x27;ve EVER used.  Will definitely buy again.  I am a satisfied customer.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The color is a natural tan, and really does a good job within just one application. I gave it a four for the price - it&#x27;s expensive for the size.</li>
    <li> I tried the Thermalab self tanning towelettes, which was my 1st experience with self tanning and was pleased with the application and non streaky look.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is a white cream color and the application is even easier than the tanning towelettes. I was worries again about an un even application or orange look, you know the fake tan look. I am happy to report this is not the case! Once again a great application and great finish!&lt;br /&gt;Another great plus it the not so oooooh you must have just tanned look and smell I have seen on friends. There is no fake tan smell that I have noticed. It does not rub off onto your clothes either.&lt;br /&gt;To apply you should obviously apply to clean dry skin, preferably freshly exfoliated. I did this and applied the lotion with my hands to my legs and finished up my nighttime skin care routine and drying my hair. By the time I was done with that I was ready for bed. It is recommended that you do not have any clothing on the areas of application for approx 20 min. This will ensure no patchy look.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and happy it is a very natural look. I am loving the second day application for the more sun kissed look as well.</li>
    <li> Great product without the vile smell so common with tanning products</li>
    <li> I received this self tanner for free in order to review it for my blog. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much - I&#x27;ve tried others that don&#x27;t work, or leave residue on your clothes, sheets, etc.  So I read the tips the company sent with the lotion, then grabbed some gloves and applied this lotion to my legs before bedtime.  I was shocked to find bronzed legs in the morning! No fake-bake orange look, but a real, sun-kissed bronze! And it lasted for at least 4 days with daily showers and bubble baths before bedtime.  I really love this lotion!</li>
    <li> Gives very natural color and lasts longer than any other self tanner about 8 days with only one application. I do use tanning beds once every two weeks or so and this product keeps the color beautiful and I only used tanning bed once this month because of thermalabs tanner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fair redhead who has used just about every self tanner ever made. I bought this, hoping it would be the last I&#x27;d ever have to try. Nope. It&#x27;s just okay. The only thing I did like about it was that it didn&#x27;t stink super bad.  The color it gave me was slightly orangy. Nothing I haven&#x27;t got from any other lotion. Plus, being clear, it&#x27;s hard to see where it&#x27;s going.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Color isn&#x27;t dark enough though. Fake Bake 60 second tan is a great natural color and drys faster.</li>
    <li> I am giving my honest and unbiased opinion after receiving this product from Thermalabs through Tomoson.com:&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a self tanner before. I have always been afraid of the &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; color people talk about. This definitely did not give an orange color. I have only used this twice and I can already see a difference. Finally a natural way to get color without the harsh effects of the sun. I haven&#x27;t found the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; way to apply yet. The first time, I found streaks on my legs. The second time, I avoided the streaky legs, but my feet had streaks. I just need to pay more attention to it. I am considering buying the mitt they sell for application. This does have a &amp;#34;faint&amp;#34; smell as someone else mentioned. It smells like a self-tanner. Nothing horrible. I usually put it on after the shower and go to bed. Nothing has stained clothes or sheets. It absorbs quickly. I wake up in the morning and see the difference. I will keep continuing to use.</li>
    <li> one of the best self tanners out there!</li>
    <li> It made flesh colored spots turn an extreme dark brown so now I cannot show my legs at all!</li>
    <li> This self tanner is amazing! I  had stage 3 melanoma about 10 years ago,(I was only 24 when diagnosed) and have been avoiding tanning and getting color from the sun since then. Sunless tanners are wonderful if you have the right product. I have tried literally hundreds of different kind of sunless tanners and this one is my favorite now. It smells delicious, ( no disgusting after smell the morning after applying) the color was not streaky or blotchy in any area. I have fair skin and with this product I looked very tan and felt beautiful. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is actually my first review of ANY product, I was so disappointed that I felt I should say something.&lt;br /&gt;First: they say there is no smell. There is and it smells SUPER flowery. Not a terrible smell, but it is STRONG.&lt;br /&gt;Second: when other tanners have worked great, this one didn&#x27;t do anything. Seriously. I followed all the instructions to the T and also compared the instructions in the book. And I even waited longer up to 12 hours as nothing had happened at 8 or 10. And definitely nothing happened at 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Third: The free E-book, is littered with Grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and at times some serious contradictions. I had to reread parts to unravel the mess that was that quickly thrown together piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost pretty damn sure that this is a scam, and that whomever this seller this product is just bottling up flowery ass lotion and giving you an ebook that was just copy and pasted parts from around the internet including contrary beliefs. There was some useful info in there, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But buying from this seller left a bad taste in my mouth and the product only left a strong flowery ODOR on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually wondering if most of the people who gave it a good review are suffering hard from the placebo effect and actually think that their skin looked different?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, good luck to you with this product. There are quite a few of us who think this is crap.</li>
    <li> Looks so natural.  Last long and doesn&#x27;t streak!!!</li>
    <li> Perhaps I have unique skin, but this product did absolutely nothing that lotion wouldn&#x27;t do. On the plus side, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it staining my clothing.</li>
    <li> The thing I like the best about this was that fact that there wasn&#x27;t any of that &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; smell which is such a turn off to me.  I did get some nice color after using it a couple times, but I didn&#x27;t get as dark as I have from other self tanners.  After using it a few more times, I did achieve a nice natural color. I&#x27;m usually afraid to use these on my face, but this was very natural, and looked great on my face and neck as well.</li>
    <li> I love this tanner! It gives even, natural looking tan, it has a subtle pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave any orange residue like some self tanners do. I will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! No orange, great color, no streaks...LOVE!</li>
    <li> This is a truly awesome self tanning product and it does not stink.  Over the years I have used many different brands of self tanning products and this is by far the best.  No straking and it has a nice natural color.</li>
    <li> It does give a nice tan but I had to apply it twice. Other then that, it went on evenly and I&#x27;ll use it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best Self Tanner  I have used and I have used alot... Would highly recommend buying this self tanner.... Awesome Seller!!! Thanks!!!:):)</li>
    <li> Easily applied with results in 1-2 applications. I use gloves to keep hands from discoloring, and have an all over even tan.</li>
    <li> The product smells fine and goes on smooth. It does give a soft natural tan that&#x27;s not orangey-  I only gave 4 stars because size of bottle vs price.  I will continue to purchase and use on face and chest, but only special occasions for legs</li>
    <li> Great product, just as advertised. I followed the instructions and applied overnight. Looked very subtle but great the day after and then I applied one more time and got the perfect tone! Do the day after day (two time application) to get the best results! Recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t streak. Easy to apply and the color looks very natural. It doesn&#x27;t sit in fine lines and wrinkles either. I used some other stuff in the past and it made me look older because it would get darker in the creases of my face; not this stuff. I love it and I will buy it again once I&#x27;m out. No more tanning for me!</li>
    <li> I love it it looks really natural !!!</li>
    <li> Great service and great product!&lt;br /&gt;Very recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> The product was easy to purchase, arrived on time and met expectations. The product works as described and I like the results.</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanning product, works as advertised and I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for as long as I can remember and this is truly the best out there for the price and the outstanding ingredients. It&#x27;s smooth, smells wonderful and gives simply the best tan after your second application. Totally recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I try to protect my skin from the sun but I love having a tan. I am always so skeptical when it comes to a self tanner but this one has been great. I only wanted a subtle color change, I think anything to drastic and it will be noticeably fake because I&#x27;m so fair. I use mine about 2-3 times a week and on the days I don&#x27;t I just use my normal moisturizing lotion. I do have to warn you though, before using any self tanner, definitely exfoliate! I would definitely recommend this product though. It has given me just what I was looking for without a stinky smell. Be sure to wash palms afterwards and between your fingers to avoid staining. Before putting any on my knees or elbows I apply my normal daily moisturizer to those areas because they tend to be dryer than the other areas of your body to avoid taking darker to those areas. Good luck and I hope you find my review helpful!</li>
    <li> Been using your product now for about 2 weeks, looks like I had a tropical vacation. Loving the product. I have brought another bottle as present. Can&#x27;t wait to give it. I will be buying more. Will be telling all my friends about your product.</li>
    <li> best self tanner I have ever used. Hands down. To be fair, I am olive, dark skinned to begin with. But this tanner goes on evenly, no streaks, and didn&#x27;t stain my hands. It gets a golden, indian summer brown. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Thermalabs Self Tanner gave me a realistic looking tan without the hassel of going to the beach. Easy to follow instructions and the scent was not overpowering.There were not fade spots nor streaking after showering and the color stayed on for several days. I highly recomend this  product!&lt;br /&gt;Rich</li>
    <li> I got this a couple of weeks ago. It arrived quickly and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. Gives nice even coverage and it smells great! Normally, I don&#x27;t like the self-tanning scent but this one is like a nice, light perfume as well. Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy to have this self tan lotion!!  Just love it!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days already and did not have any allergic reaction!!!  Yaayyy</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product! It goes on like a thick body lotion (so, you don&#x27;t need as much as you think you do) and dries quickly. And I woke up to a really nice, even, streak-free tan. Best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used by far, and no self-tanner smell!!!</li>
    <li> Has fragrance, which was NOT listed as an ingredient on the Amazon website. I&#x27;m terribly disappointed. I would not have purchased the product had I known. Anyone truly serious about purchasing organic products is also serious about avoiding fragrance... So sad.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. This is THE BEST self-tanner on the market and I believe I have tried them all. No streaks. Does not rub off on clothing and sheets. The color is a beautiful natural tan - no orange here! I will definitely be re-ordering. Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> This is so far the best self tanner I have ever used. I&#x27;m in my mid-50s and am trying to use more natural and organic products on my mature skin. I followed the instructions with full body exfoliation and using rubber gloves (they work better for me vs a mitt).  I put the Thermalab over my entire body in the late afternoon.  I mixed it with my regular body lotion for feet, ankles, knees and elbows, let it dry for a few minutes then put some clothes on.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything when I went to bed several hours later.  However, I woke up and my skin had a lovely natural looking tan and absolutely nothing on my sheets or clothes!  I always have creases and uneven color on my neck area as it&#x27;s aging but this product looks beautiful - no splotches at all.....first time I have found something that works on my neck and it looks so smooth and natural.  I&#x27;ve reapplied the self tanner 3 times in 2 weeks with a few days in between and now I&#x27;m going on almost a full week just using my regular body lotion and it still looks amazing, even after shaving my legs several times.  As with other products you don&#x27;t see the color come off and go down the drain in the shower - it has amazing staying power.  My skin really does look tan and healthy.  The fragrance is mild and natural, not a harsh chemical smell like other tanning products.  I&#x27;ve mixed it with my face moisturizer before bed and wake up with a perfect glow.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Used a glove and I still had streaking on my legs.</li>
    <li> I have to say at 57 years old I was very sceptic about doing a self tanning. I first ordered the mitt, because I was not reading the whole description when I first got it I was a little disappointed in the face that I had to also but the lotion. I finally got the nerve to order the lotion. Once again I just tried to do it without reading the directions. I was very happy to see that I did not turn orange🙈👍🏽 before I could try it again I got a phone call from Cindy Hayes from the support team and she asked if I got my ebook... No I had not gotten it. She went on to give me complete directions and also sent me the ebook. Thank you Cindy. That night I used it the right way and I LOVE IT. I feel so good and younger too lol thank you Thermalabs</li>
    <li> Love the lotion and color it gives. Dont waste your tike with the applicatorvas it uses so much of the lotion. Surgical gloves or examining gloves work better for much less of a prices</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Goes on easy, feels good on the skin. Makes your skin self tan wonderfully, and natural looking. Non streaky, does not smell funny, beautiful glow. The only reason I gave it 3 stars because of Amazon cancelling my order 3 times; other then that the product is amazing!</li>
    <li> Smells good, dries fast, doesn&#x27;t stain, really works and doesn&#x27;t turn you orange.... at least I followed the instructions, first time, just s shade darker to start... enough not to be embarrassed about my pale legs. I am very happy, and would buy again in a heartbeat. Definitely worth the money compared to the paint on orange glow... yuck.</li>
    <li> Gradual gentle color, realistic color, that doesn&#x27;t stink, It&#x27;s worth a try</li>
    <li> At first when I put it on I didn&#x27;t like it but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m just so white! I put on a second application and I started liking it. After the 3rd application I loved it! Its a very nice color and no odor which is a plus!! I apply the lotion every 4 to 5 days just to keep the color so nice. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!! I am really white &amp; got this kind of amazing result after just a week. It&#x27;s a regular routine now-I&#x27;m enjoying looking a little more summer without any health risk. It applies smooth, NO streaks, no difficult smell and hasn&#x27;t transferred on to any fabrics. Pretty amazing stuff!! If you haven&#x27;t tried it and you are a porcelain princess like me you will love it !!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different self tanners and this is by far the best.  Natural color, nice scent, no streaks, moisturizing and easy to apply.  Excellent customer service and extremely fast shipping as well.  Will definitely order this product again.</li>
    <li> What a gimmick this is! I&#x27;ve used many self tanners over the years and this is by far the worst. . I don&#x27;t get how they can lie so blatantly about  this product!  I rarely write reviews.... but to use propaganda photos like the one above is truly false advertising!&lt;br /&gt;It takes forever to absorb into the skin but what&#x27;s worse is it makes a barrier so it&#x27;s almost impossible to permeate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Never have I used a product so bad that I would write a review . This is pure crap!</li>
    <li> I have tried natural self tanners in the past and this is by far the best.  It does not dry out my skin and does not have that strange self tanner smell plus the results were very natural and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply with a pleasant scent. I followed the directions and showered/exfoliated before applying then went to bed. I awoke to a beautiful color without streaks. I repeated the process the following day and was very pleased with the color. Another bonus that&#x27;s very important to me is that it&#x27;s made from natural and Organic ingredients and I feel good about using it on my skin!  I would definitely recommend this product and am going to place another order asap! This is my new go-to sunless tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Love this self tanner! Very easy to apply (I used the mitt). I have very fair skin and this did not make me look orange. It gave me a very natural looking tan!</li>
    <li> The pump does not work so I am going to have to use it thru the open bottle. Cannot get the pump unlocked. My husband tried also - to late to send back</li>
    <li> Awesome product &amp; amazing costumer service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product. Worked very well just as described. I&#x27;ll definitely add this to my collection for the future use.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this tanner.  It seems to be a described and service was great.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is so far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used (and trust me I&#x27;ve used!!!) doesn&#x27;t streak, smells very good and it&#x27;s already 8 days after I applied it - the color stays beautiful (I did the day after day application like in the picture). Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My new favorite self-tanner. I&#x27;ve used a couple different cheap products before, but the texture and great smell of the Thermalabs self-tanner is so far the best! The results came the day after and I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the same tan you get when you&#x27;re tanning in the sun - but it&#x27;s close enough and my skin feels really good, without getting it burnt!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everybody and especially for people who want an organic product with the best ingredients.</li>
    <li> Of the three self tanners I tried this summer, Natural Self Tanner is by far the best. It has a very mild fragrance and goes on very smoothly. The lotion is white in color, so it seems cleaner than the darker colored lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t stain hands or sheets, and does not build up around elbows and knees. It creates a very natural looking tan -- no orange tone.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product, it is gentle, the color looks natural and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes or looks orange like many other self-tanning products. Also, I feel that my skin got more smooth and moist since I have been using it.</li>
    <li> it really works. Take the time and you save yourself a lot of time in spray tanning salons. I have no streaks or uneven coloration. I ordered 5 bottles and took a risk, but the revues encouraged me and I&#x27;m glad I used the savings per bottle. I swim every day and now my tanned body gives me much more confidence. One other thing that is different than other self tanning products I tried over the years is, this on your body do not smell hours later.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of self tanners, and decided to give this a try.  It applies very smooth and clear like lotion.  Has a VERY good smell that doesn&#x27;t smell like other tanners. Leaves no streaks or patches.  I applied it before bed, and when I woke up the next morning, I had a nice glow.  I do wish it would have been darker.  I applied it 2 nites in a row, and the color builds evenly.  Not quite dark enough for me considering 2 applications in a row.  Reminds me of a gradual tanner, but slightly faster color.</li>
    <li> I have tried SO many self tanners, anything from St. Tropez to Fake Bake. Problem with all of them: they run off on your clothes, sheets and furniture; they are not waterproof; they only last 2 days tops. This one is AMAZING! I haven&#x27;t had any issues, it&#x27;s easy to apply and looks very natural. It does not have the horrid &#x27;self tanner&#x27; smell. Would 100% recommend!</li>
    <li> a bit streaky, you have to be careful to be very even in application to avoid this, and it is tad more orange than I had hoped for, but overall very good.</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely, smells nice and tans nicely. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day right out of the shower. I take my time getting dressed to give the lotion time to dry. I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> Great product it does its job ! Shipping was fast and I love the fact that its organic . I&#x27;m a breastfeeding mom so I&#x27;m really careful with products I use .i also got an amazing deal -$12 !! Must try for everyone who likes self tanning</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! I put it on at night before going to bed, and woke up with a nice golden glow. I was a little worried about it getting on my sheets….NOPE…not at all! I was noticeably darker. It was nice and even, no streaks at all. I will be a customer for life. I also got the wipes for when I want color quick. The customer service here is outstanding. I received a call to make sure I didn&#x27;t have any questions. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Product does no better than any other self tanner I have purchased in the past. VERY dissatisfied</li>
    <li> I am quite amazed with this tanner. It works! Yes, it does take at least overnight but it is a beautiful tan and I have had no problems with streaking! The best part: the fragrance is wonderful. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Gives a nice tan. Just be sure to follow instructions. I was a little careless and had a line but it faded in a few days.</li>
    <li> Thermalabs is the best tanning product I have tried. It does not streak and it smells good. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Evenly tanned. But orange for a day. Did not reapply for a week and tan was gone, which I expected. But my pores were still tan. I had tiny dots all over my legs that many people noticed. I applied again and it was orange again. But I reapplied after 4 days and it was fine. For the price I expected higher quality. Has a funky smell  that lasted for a day. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have a whole bathroom shelf full of discarded self-tanners; some pretty fairly expensive. Last year I simply gave up, but late this year decided to look again on line and saw the reviews for this product. I have used it not quite a week and it beats them all. So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY self tanner I have EVER used that doesnt have that weird tan smell! It actually smells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have used it for two nights in a row on my body and for three nights on my face. It gives a slight tan at first but I guess the more frequently  you use it the more tan you will get  (like anything else)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really dont like putting anything weird on my face but since this actually smelled good and was natural/organic i figured i would give it a shot. I did my night face routine (washed &amp; vitamin C serum with bert&#x27;s bees blemish stick on certain areas) and then I mixed this with my face moisturizer (which has retinol in it) as my last step. I was hoping the tanner wouldnt get all weird with all of my night routine products but it didnt!  I dont look like a zombie anymore and I am SO happy. Also, I have found that any red marks from old pimples are now not that much noticeable and I dont have to wear concealer over them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is since its not like a colored tanner or instant bronze you have to really watch where you put the product and rub it in good (I have a few spots on my arm that are way darker than others)  Another downside- I think this stuff could get addicting, LOL. I could probably use it every night because its moisturizing and it doesnt smell bad!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, great customer service. They left me a voice mail today saying if i had questions/concerns to call them. I order a LOT of stuff on Amazon and no one has ever done this. You can tell they take pride in their company.</li>
    <li> I have tried other self tanners that work fine but this one intrigued me because of the organic ingredients.  It worked just like it said it would.  I put it on before bed and in the morning could see a nice layer of tan with no streaks or smudges.  My daughter tried it too and she really liked it as well.</li>
    <li> This may have made my skin a bit darker, but not noticeably.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is great. Considering its natural/organic, I didn&#x27;t expect this to provide as much of a glow as it did!  I am pleasantly surprised! Been using Ahava dead sea body lotion before applying this. First coat: some glow/tan. Did it again next day after lotion. I like this color. Use 2 days in a row here and there. What amazes me, is there is no streaks in this. I have sun labs. fake bake, etc. They provide deeper color, but it inevitably streaks. I do smell that home \\&quot;tan\\&quot; smell with this, but its not much. The no streaks and glow are really worth it. Plus, as another reviewer said too, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothing. I actually wish they would make a bigger bottle of this. I will be using this consistently.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great price. I cannot believe how fast it is delivered.  They are always providing information to make your experience better. This is the only product of its type I will use.</li>
    <li> This stuff DOES WORK amazingly ! BUT you HAVE TO put it on evenly and you can&#x27;t skip areas because it will be noticeable.</li>
    <li> I REALLY like this product. I have used the spray tan booths before and this has much better coverage and lasts longer. If you happen to miss a spot, you can go over the area/s and cover with ease. I used gloves the first couple of times, but found if I washed my hands immediately afterwards, it did not stain, so I ditched the gloves. I have used the product on its own, and simultaneously with a tanning bed as I have a trip coming up. Works great for both situations. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was so excited to receive it that when I did yesterday I put on a thin layer right away, waited a few hours and didnt see any difference so I put on another.. woke up still no difference. Seems to even out my skin tone but thats about it is why I gave it 4 stars still not bad even if I don&#x27;t achieve what I was hoping. Does anyone know how many layers I need to apply before seeing a result? Im between a beige and fair skin more on the beige side.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this tanner a couple of times now, color is good, no streaks or orange.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick, and company emailed a follow up, which was nice!</li>
    <li> Wow, what an amazing self tanning lotion!  It doesn&#x27;t smell or look fake on your body like all the other self tanners on the market. This lotion from Thermalabs is so natural and gives you a beautiful tan. It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes either. I am so lucky to finally find a self tanner that I like after all these years of trying so many brands. I would give it 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> my body and face look orange.not happy</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion hoping for a little natural tan. Instead I got weird orange streaks and a terrible rash.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! I am very fair and this just gives you a nice glow. I don&#x27;t look orange or strange. You can put on more often and get a darker tan but I just like the fact that it make me look like I have some color in my skin. It looks very natural.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an organic, more natural alternative to other self tanners, and found this one. I really like it!! Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smell like fake tan... almost has a grape smell? I do with it was a little darker, but I like this for an everyday lotion, and if I need something darker I mix or layer ;-)</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion!  No streaks, looks natural.  If you hate sunless tanning lotion please give this a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. My tan looks natural and not streaky. The first time I used it, I did feel a little itchy, but I think it&#x27;s because I was rushing and cold.  I haven&#x27;t felt any itching subsequently.  Today is the specially priced Prime Day in July. It has it listed as a retail cost of $40+ . However, I never paid this amount. As far as I know, it&#x27;s always been $20+. Originally, I searched for an organic tanner. I don&#x27;t believe it is organic, but does seem more natural than most others. The label says it is made with natural and organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for thus stuff but wasn&#x27;t all that thrilled with it. While it does give quick amazing color it&#x27;s hard not to get it to streak..it&#x27;s drying ...and it does last somewhat long but will come off if you shave. It also has a good smell while applying but just like every self tanner in the world it ends up having that nasty smell. I will probably buy this again but only to apply on my legs after I sun tan to give them a boost</li>
    <li> Works just like it says!&lt;br /&gt;I use it a few days a week at mist and am very happy!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I am more than pleased with the Organic Self Tanner as it really does not streak or leaves an orange tint on the Skin. It looks very natural and as long as one exfoliates before each use , it works like a charm. I shall certainly recommend it to all my friends. Quite a find .</li>
    <li> Does not work on my fair skin.  Did nothing after three consecutive attempts.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have been using the same self tanner for years now after trying so many that didn&#x27;t work. But nothing compares to this one! It works instantly within a few hours &amp; left me no streaks what so ever. I love it, I&#x27;ll be ordering it for good now.</li>
    <li> This product did not work well for me sooo disapointed as reviews were good. No more color than what you would get with one app of jergens glow!! However it sure stuck to my hands in an orangey sort of way! Only good thing, no smell and it is a white cream, none of that nasty, stick to your clothes bronze color that everyone seems to think is necessary in a sunless tanner!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I like that I can apply at night, no residue or odor on sheets.  Wake up to nice medium tan.  I use nitrile or latex gloves to apply, wand applicator for back.  No stain to worry about on hands. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> does a great job, needs to be applied slowly to build up a good tan look</li>
    <li> Was very excited to recieve this product. But then.... The lotion itself works okay. It gives a decent color but i expected alot more from it. Also it says it can be used for the face but the lotion itself feels very heavy and almost oily. I have started to break out on my face. I am going to stop using it on the face and see what happens. It also doesnt dry very quick. Because it is so thick it almost feels like my skin will not be able to breathe. Its ok if your just looking for a base color without a drastic change. Also the self tan secrets arent secrets. It basically just tells you to exfoliate and put lotion on your knees and elbows. It came in a email and not a book. Was kind of disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I have spent a fortune on self-tanners over the years with less than stellar results - leaving me orange and streaky. America&#x27;s Best Organic Self-Tanner is different. It goes on easily, absorbs quickly and leaves you tan, not orange! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Finally I can keep a year round tan without being concerned about harsh chemicals... it really makes such a difference when I look my best b/c I feel my best, and this product really helps me achieve that.  I am ordering my second bottle and will continue to order more... only request would be for a fragrance free alternative.. I am still in search of an organic self tanner that doesn&#x27;t smell (I am just really sensitive) so I hope this issue can be addressed before someone else makes it b/c I would love to stay a loyal customer to this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best self tanner I have used. It is not greasy. It absorbs into the skin. It has a gentle glow and not a harsh orange. The company actually emailed me to ask my thoughts. It is expensive at its &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; price but it seems to often be on sale. Especially for prime members. I have purchased it several times. I use it daily to keep my tan glowing from tropical holidays. Even once the tropical tan is gone, the glow is nice. I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I got a bottle for me and one for my daughter (she hasn&#x27;t tried yet) and I only used once on my face, neck, arms and chest area and I am really glad I purchased this tanner. It does absorb nicely and started developing after 2-3 hours on me and my skin has a nice light tan,with 1 application...not orange. I love that it doesn&#x27;t stink...there is a very faint odor but you have to put your nose to your skin to smell it and the next day it was gone. I so glad I can feel good put this on without any worries of chemicals being absorbed into my skin. My daughter and I are going on vacation to California in July and we both want to be tan when we get there...so this is our perfect tanner.</li>
    <li> I will admit, as often as I rely on them to decide on making a purchase, I am not quite as good about leaving product reviews on many of my Amazon purchases.&lt;br /&gt;However, from time to time, I feel the need to make the effort when a product exceptionally exceeds my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;THIS is one of those times!!&lt;br /&gt;Growing up with fair skin under the Australian sun, the message for my entire childhood about the effects of sun damage to my skin was literally pummeled into me 24/7. So after having 6 small moles removed before the age of 13, even now living most my adult life here in the USA, I have still never forgotten that lesson. And for quite a good number of years, sunless tanners have been of constant use in my everyday.&lt;br /&gt;This .. Hands down is the best product I have EVER used... EVER.&lt;br /&gt;And I have tried A LOT!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how natural it looks and how great and even the color develops.  Despite having a hard time applying self tanner to my feet &amp; ankles in a manner that doesn&#x27;t look completely blotchy and uneven no matter what I seem to do.. This product even made my feet look good (I still mixed with a bit of palmers lotion and barley applied)  I couldn&#x27;t believe it! The smell is non existent and the color honestly lasts.. Not lasts as in 1-3 days .. I mean 5+..&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is.. This is the ONLY company I will be purchasing self tanner from again. I am blown away by it.. And if you use self tanners, truthfully.. You would be crazy not to try it.. (And to be clear, I&#x27;m not in any way affiliated with the company) this is just a 100% thrilled new customer.. Who knows how much she has spent over the years buying countless brands and types and knows how frustrating this type of product.. as well as expensive can be.&lt;br /&gt;I am just so stoked that I can actually say I have found a fantastic one that I can just be confident in and no longer have to waste time looking around for. I myself will be purchasing often from them... Just so I don&#x27;t have to wait to have it on hand, for when the bottle is up. Cheers!e to wait to have it on hand, for when the bottle is up. Cheers!</li>
    <li> Was not sure  about this product when I put it on them  and then I looked and my skin and tan look real... very happy to be tanned and not so pale...this time of year in florida it is shorts weather  and pale legs are not fun...</li>
    <li> I am so happy to find a natural product that actually works.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the color this turned my skin.  I&#x27;m pale, but have a reddish tint to my skin.  Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  I am very pale.  I have been using sunless tanners for about 9 years.  Every summer I try a new product and figured I would give a natural product a try.  This product doesnt compare to the products I have been purchasing at beauty salons.  I look pale yellow and streaky.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works like it says!  I also ordered the gloves that Amazon recommends, which were great for applying the lotion, but don&#x27;t use the sample packets of tanner that come with the gloves!  THAT product (Sun Goddess) is awful.  The Thermalab Lotion looks great!</li>
    <li> This lotion tans beautifully, however, just like any other product, it smells awful! They claim that it doesn&#x27;t smell... but unfortunately, it has that nasty fake tan smell like any other self tanning product. The fact that it&#x27;s not supposed to smell is the primary reason I bought it, in addition to the good reviews it had. About 3 days after I bought it, a lady emailed me and called me to get my opinion on it. I didn&#x27;t have time to get into a sales debate, so I ignored those communications. Overall, the lotion tans nicely and I will probably still use the remainder of it, since it was expensive... But it&#x27;s def not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works the best out of any lotion I&#x27;ve tried and spray tan too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m officially a lifer. Best self tanner I have ever used. Not streaky at all. I just have a perfectly smooth, even tan. I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Love this Thermalabs self tanner!! I have tried many other brands but after a few applications did not like the color! Not the case here, it is a natural looking tan and if you mix lotion on elbows, ankles it does help like others have said. Download the book, it has great tips. Happy to have a natural looking tan without having to lay in the sun😀 Oh yeah after 2 applications for me, I&#x27;m good to go...not having to take a week like other products do!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Very pleased with the product. No annoying smell or greasy feel left after using the lotion and the tan is a great color. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purcahse more and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase from this seller again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see the feedback you posted (this one):&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thanks you for the great service. Love product! Went on very smooth and no unpleasant smell. It&#x27;s only been 24 hours since I applied, but can see a difference already. I tan very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again, Sharon</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Fast, natural looking tan.</li>
    <li> Great smell...works very well. I had never tried this brand before, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and effectiveness of it.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good. It practically does not smell like most department store&#x27;s self-tanners do (hello, Jergen); it first develops into a subtle caramel hue but then gets darker even if you do not reapply more product, which is a great advantage, and it does stay on, meaning it does not fade away quickly or rub off your sheets and clothes. I have just started using it, so I am hoping with more use the shade will deepen, but overall it&#x27;s a solid product that I&#x27;ll use together with my fakebake stuff. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I&#x27;m very pleased. It is so easy to use and the end result is just what I want. What more can I say. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Turned me orange.....but that&#x27;s just my &amp;#34;chemcial mak-up&amp;#34;. You could possibly have better results.  However, after 3 days the color just rolled off with a wash cloth!  Which was great cuz orange is NOT my color. lol&lt;br /&gt;And YES, I followed all the steps...I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for years.  Not good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That&#x27;s the nice thing about having so many verations of the same thing.  If this doesn&#x27;t work...try another!</li>
    <li> Great product, great shipping, and great deal. Girlfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> Did not work well on my skin. But seller gave full return</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this but I have to say it just wasn&#x27;t that good.  I am a self-tanning expert, having used pretty much every major brand, so I know how to prep and apply and the tan I got from this was so splotchy and uneven, it also seemed like it took forever to really dry on me.  Honestly my legs looked so bad I had to wear long pants to the gym because it really did look like I had a rash.  I was not impressed with this product and would not recommend this to a friend, there are far better and much cheaper alternatives available.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery. Customer service is the best i&#x27;ve seen for a company selling on amazon. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it works &amp;#34;overnight,&amp;#34; but after a few nights it gives a really nice natural glow. I&#x27;d suggest 2 nights in a row for a good base.</li>
    <li> Lotion is easy to use, gradual and easy to control. No scent, not messy.. All natural. Only good things to say about it, And I&#x27;ve tried quite a few self tanners over the years. Seller emailed directions and tips which was nice and helpful.</li>
    <li> I do professional spray tans for clients and am currently looking for a product to recommend them for use to maintain what I put on them.  I purchased it for myself to try first and I LOVE it.  The initial smell is nice and soft and the texture and consistency is perfect.  It goes on easy and smooth and after the first application my tan looks natural and even.  I also like that is has mostly organic ingredients.  Well done thermalabs I will be telling all my clients to purchase this product!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice doesn&#x27;t smell foul like other self tanners.  Is more moisturizing but takes alot of applications to get dark</li>
    <li> Works as stated. Nice tan overnight and smells good. Streak-free. Love this.</li>
    <li> Leaves streaks and I didn&#x27;t get the book !</li>
    <li> So i tried this out on my foot to see what it would do. It went on clear, color didn&#x27;t show until later in the day. I didn&#x27;t apply much at all and my foot is  ORANGE. It doesn&#x27;t look natural one bit. i&#x27;m sure it may be because it is my foot, but if it doesn&#x27;t look good on my foot i do not want it on the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> The ultimitt is the best applicator I&#x27;ve ever used.  Five stars. And it doesn&#x27;t soak up a lot of product. The small face mitt is awesome too</li>
    <li> Loved this product. I used it for a week before Vegas and was several shades hadner. I am fairly white and I had not tanned naturally at all before using this. I had no streaking even after being in the pools in Vegas. I did have to exfoliate some spots off after returning from vacation since I did not continue  to reapply. In comparison to my spray tan experiences this lotion is wonderful. It does have a hint of that tan smell, however it&#x27;s not like anyone else can notice. I did not get any discoloration on dry spots like elbows or knees. I&#x27;ve already been recommending this product to many people. This is now my go to product before vacations, bikini season, etc.</li>
    <li> The best self tanner I&#x27;ve found.  NO SCENT!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive Skin Dye!  Where&#x27;s The Book?</li>
    <li> Great self tanner!! Very natural color.</li>
    <li> I have since become super aware that we are one of the only 1 st world countries that STILL use animals for testing. In MANY other countries it is banned.  I wanted a product that DID NOT test on animals.  This product worked great on my body..however still did not work great on my face.  Great smell and overall coverage..(I am really fair and burn at the first hint of a sunny day)Contacted for the &amp;#34;secret Booklet&amp;#34; via email and phone..didn&#x27;t receive it.</li>
    <li> I have darker skin so was afraid that this product might not give me a dark enough tan.  I have tried many others including Fake Bake but find that Thermalabs is by far the best self tanning product.  Its a thick cream which goes a long, long way.  It does not stain, come off on clothes, etc. and has a pleasant smell.  I use it daily as a moisturizer after showering and have received so many comments on my &#x27;beautiful tan&#x27;.  I was also amazed to have received a call from Cindy Hayes at Thermalabs because they forgot to send me the guide (I had no idea I was supposed to get it).  Excellent product and service.  Thanks Thermalab &amp; Cindy!</li>
    <li> I purchased the toweletts and love the color, the smell was about the same as any other so that&#x27;s ok but the one issue I had was that the towelette didn&#x27;t cover me, I had to use two.  They are smaller than other brands I&#x27;ve used and it just seemed to dry out after covering my arms and chest.  I&#x27;m not a large person so I would have assumed that one towelette would have been suffice.  I bought them at a great deal but wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for them.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims it will do. The smell of it is very nice. Not that strange lotion smell. It applies easily. I was very nervous and took a huge risk because I applied the lotion then went to bed in with my new bedspread &amp; sheets (a light tan color) and realized when I won&#x27;t up it wasn&#x27;t a smart idea--- but to my surprise it didn&#x27;t stain the sheet or anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance I figured it didn&#x27;t do much to my skin but then I noticed I didn&#x27;t apply it to certain spots on my body. (Inside of my arms &amp; inner thighs) I quickly saw the difference in color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice natural glow. I highly reccommed using this product and I will be making a secon purchase. However, I did by this when it was 50% off (25$) if the product was more than that I don&#x27;t know that I would do it. It&#x27;s a large price for a little amount of lotion..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have 4 stars because this is needed to be applied to the whole body to work- therefore the 6 ounces you pay for is not a whole lot. You will go through it very quickly and can become pricy.</li>
    <li> Day one next morning I saw a tan.  Used product accordingly and I&#x27;m amazed at the results. On the 2nd application I really see a beautiful tan.  I&#x27;m blonde so this tan on the 2nd application has me looking like I spent days in the sun.  Not orange or streaky just a smooth beautiful tan.  Thermalabs, you have me as a great customer!  Just amazing results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and makes a great tan overnight. I put a little too much on at first and it streaked on one leg. But that&#x27;s easy to learn about and fix.</li>
    <li> PRESENTLY, I AM REVIEWING THE TOWLETTES, BUT I LEARNED FROM CUSTOMER SERVICES (CINDY) THAT THERE IS A LOTION.....WHICH I WILL TRY NEXT.  THE PRODUCT IS EXCEPTIONAL; NO ORANGEY LOOK, NO SMELL. IN SOME REVIEWS PEOPLE DETECTED A MINIMAL ODOR; THEIR NOSES, MUST BE FAR SUPERIOR TO MINE, AS I DETECTED NOTHING! THE TOWLETTES ARE MORE OF A CLOTH-LIKE CONSISTENCY AS OPPOSED TO THE MORE COMMON PAPER-LIKE CONSISTENCY (I.E. KATE SOMMERVILLE , TAN TOWELS). PERHAPS, THIS DIFFERENCE ALLOWS FOR THE STREAK FREE, OR STREAK FORGIVING QUALITY THAT I NOTED. I ALSO APPLIED THE TOWLETTE TO MY FACE, AFTER CHEST, ARMS, ETC...SO THAT IT WAS DRIER...WORKED VERY WELL.  CUSTOMER SERVICES WAS VERY RESPONSIVE AS THE TANNING BOOKLET NEVER ARRIVED AS IT SHOULD HAVE; NOW IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOADED. I WILL TRY THE LOTION IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used!!  It gives a great color - not orange.  I am fair and have small freckles.  I have to be very careful in the sun.  I have tried many, many self tanners - this one is the best!!  There was a little bit of odor for a short time on the first day.  After that - noooo ordor!!! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried it all and this self tanner is great, no streaks. I hope they make a face self tanner soon!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best sunless tanner I have used. I plan to reorder it religiously ! I have tried several different tanners in the past, some were really expensive and lefted me very dissatisfied . This tanner is giving me a natural looking tan. Not yellow or orange honestly a nice bronze everyone wants to know what tanning bed I use .. I am very fair complected but even after the first night I saw a nice base bronze . The tips that the manufacturer sent me also helps never before has anyone taken the time to tell me how to get the best results!! Great product !</li>
    <li> I called Cindy at Thermalabs to ask  if I really need to wait 24 hours after shavingt to apply  the &amp;#34;Natural Self Tanner Lotion&amp;#34;. Cindy replied &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34;!! She saved me  from looking ridiculous at a very important function!  I am impressed with everything about this product, from the natural  tan  color, to the free &amp;#34;self tanning secrets&amp;#34; guide. If you, like me, are new to self tanning, rest assured. Thermalabs stands behind their products, you can call their customer service number and someone will be there to answer any questions you might have!</li>
    <li> I love this!! Not too dark. Not too light. Just perfect!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed!  I was hoping by the positive reviews that it would work well but, the color was more orange on my pale skin.  I will go back to my Faux Tan by Bare Minerals.  It is the only self tanner that is NOT orange!</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars but it&#x27;s rather pricey.</li>
    <li> I used a whole bottle of this. I really wanted to like it because being a Nurse, I know first hand the damaging effects of the sun, and I certainly do not have the time to go tanning even if I wanted to. While out for monthly drinks and girl time with my fellow nurses, the subject of tanning came up, and someone mentioned that they heard good things about this product. I decided to \\&quot;take one for the team\\&quot; and get a bottle, I was especially enthusiastic that it was labeled as \\&quot;organic\\&quot; . I wanted to love this product, I reallyyy did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Result: Uneven streaky mess (by the time you can actually get it to show up on your skin), that over time does smell very \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; like. The smell wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me so much, but it really sneaks up on you. I was disappointed in the amount of time/applications that it took to show up. By the 3rd round, I was pretty much praying for any kind of color, so it wouldn&#x27;t be a waste of money (contrary to popular belief, nurses aren&#x27;t rich, school loans are a you-know-what to pay back.) I ended up going through the entire bottle and maybe got maybe 2 fake tans out of it (streaky and uneven tans at that, but still a tan nonetheless.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My friends were only slightly less disappointed about the end result than I was, but happy that I saved them the trouble of ordering it themselves. Lol, could you imagine a medical place full of very streaky-slightly orange tinged nurses? Patients would laugh and run the other way. At the end of the day, you live and you learn though right? Wanted to be a long- term customer, but unfortunately the pro&#x27;s certainly do not outweigh the cons.</li>
    <li> The lotion glides onto my skin very evenly and it never irritated my eczema skin nor never left any lotion residue. With this lotion my skin felt soft and smooth, it had given me a gorgeous natural tan unlike other indoor tanning lotions i had bought that would leave my skin with an awful orangey color. My skin looked very naturally tanned with an evenly glow, love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them ALL. Smells great. Thick at first so you can see where it&#x27;s going but quickly absorbs. Natural looking. Great follow up from the company/seller. Reasonable price. I&#x27;m a loyal fan and will recommend to my friends and family. I wish it came in a larger size. Well done!</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever used!  No streaks, no orange glow.  Looks like Ive spent the week at the beach!!  I saw results in one day!  I havent even used all of the first bottle, and Ive already ordered another!</li>
    <li> I did not notice any real tan or difference in skin color.  Even with the exfoliating before each time.  Not a good idea to spend your money on</li>
    <li> This product stinks and it does not get dark. Had to use a 1/4 of the bottle before I even saw any results</li>
    <li> Very nice! Can use small amounts on face at night, with no smearing on pillows.</li>
    <li> More than satisfied with the self tanner,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything out there, this is the best I have found! Not planning on trying any others, no streaking and a very natural tan result that lasts for a week.</li>
    <li> The tan wasn&#x27;t dark at all,  even after re-applying. Wore off quickly,  and came off in blotches.  It was easy to apply,  but not a very good product.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a free sample for a product review. I&#x27;ve used it on my arms and face, didn&#x27;t get too much of a tan as i expected. I will keep on trying on other parts of my body, but so far the tan hasn&#x27;t been too dark</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good product. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use self-tanners usually, but my friend recommended to try this one, and I am so glad I did! I am going to a wedding in about two weeks and want to look more tan. I decided first to test it and only applied it to one arm, the inner side of arm, before going to bed. It has a white color first when you apply, but absorbs very quickly. The lotion is nice, it&#x27;s moistirizing, but not greasy or oily, feels like a good body lotion. The next morning I was surprized that I could clearly see the difference between two arms after only one layer! It works! Also, the tan looks natural, same as what I currently have on the front part of arm. Also, I used very small amount of lotion and the bottle is pretty big, so it would last long. I think for the best results it&#x27;s better to apply it in thin layers and all over the body to avoid the border marks. I left thick layer and didn&#x27;t massage it further at one spot and could see the line at that spot, but not anywhere else. I think it&#x27;s a great product for anyone who avoids the sun but still wants to have some tan! I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> loved it!! super easy to use , smells good and the results are quick to arrive and very natural looking.</li>
    <li> Amazing self tanner! super soft, applies evenly, and creates a beautiful natural color.</li>
    <li> Not the best not the worst</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews of this and decided to try it out and I&#x27;m glad I did. I work nights so my legs rarely see the sun. I was in need of some color and don&#x27;t like the idea of tanning beds. My skin looks naturally tan, not orange at all, no streaking, and no offensive odor like other self tanners. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Buy it all of the time!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve used! I have tried all kinds, and none gave me the fast results that this one did. I recieved it quickly, and got a call from the company to make sure I got the guide and knew how to use it. Very happy! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for natural products whenever possible and I&#x27;m glad they finally have come out with a natural self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;The absolute best part about this self tanner is that you pretty much use it as a regular cream. Before applying I exfoliated my skin thoroughly and applied it all over my legs to try it out first. I applied it and rubbed it in evenly and waited around 10-15 minutes for it to dry and absorb before putting my night gown on and going to bed. When I woke up in the morning I was pretty surprised, my legs had a light tan on it and I could see the difference between my legs and the rest of the body. The tan didn&#x27;t look fake or painted on like most other products I&#x27;ve used have been so far. Also there were no weird streaks anywhere on my legs, the tan was spread evenly. It also has a light flowery smell on it but nothing too strong. My bed sheets also had absolutely no stains on it so I&#x27;m really glad about that.&lt;br /&gt;I completely love it, it gives you a realistic tan and I find it to be the easiest and most hassle free self tanner I have ever used so far.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have skin that freckles instead of tans so this product was perfect!! For me it was such a nice summer glow on the first application and the second one i look like a golden goddess!! It doesnt have a bad smell to it and it moisturizes too! I still suggest putting lotion on your knees, ankles, feet, hands and elbows though. Also it stays on pretty well and i work in the food industry to im washing my hands all the time!!  It is a small bottle but im sure it will last a long time. I feel it is worth the 20$ and i will be buying some more lol</li>
    <li> One of the best self tanners I&#x27;ve tried. I love the natural ingredients and consistency of the product.  I feel like the tan lasts longer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product.  If you love the look of a sun kissed tan, but have abandoned laying out and tanning beds, this is the product for you!!!  I have used several self-tanning products and Thermalabs is by far the best!!!  It looks like a lotion, has no noticeable scent so it doesn&#x27;t compete with your perfume or body lotion.  Best of all, it gives you a natural looking tan in about 30 minutes.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to get the desired look so you save money compared to other self-tanning products.  I have medium-light skin with freckles, but I tan easily.  I would recommend Thermalabs to any consumer that desires a sun kissed tan without the fuss!!!</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this product because I try to stick with orgainic products when I can afford them. I seen that the price was 67 peercent off ,so I decided to try the product.  I was happy with this product. I am not allergic to it which is a plus because I am allergic to alot of self tanners. I actually bought 2 more bottles yesterday because it is still on sale!  I find for me it works well for me to put it on before i go to bed.  Thank-you for coming up with a organic self tanner. It just put a big smile on my face.......</li>
    <li> This is awesome!! This is honestly the first sunless product I have used that doesn&#x27;t turn me orange or streaky. It gave me a very natural looking tan. I even got compliments on my tan! I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I first tried Thermalabs! It was the perfect tan that I&#x27;ve always wanted! My husband even wanted to start using it after he saw me with my new fabulous tan!!</li>
    <li> Even my very white Irish skin looked more colorful.....and no streaks!</li>
    <li> again, streaks, smells, doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS WONDERFUL SELF TANNER! Great materials and it really works! I am naturally very fair and this works so well even for me. Most tanners make me look well &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; this tanner gives me a natural healthy look like I&#x27;ve just been on vacation. Which for me is just what I am looking for not a fake orange looking tan like some other brands that are available.</li>
    <li> Not real good certainty for the price.</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and I was happy to discover that the quality of the product was beyond what I expected. I love the fact that it has the high natural and organic ingredients. Did not caused any irritation and overall a great product, beats baking in the sun! The tan is a very nice tone and I experienced no staining and no oily residue. Best I have used so far!</li>
    <li> Used many tanners. By far the best</li>
    <li> Love but does leave streeks if not applied correctly and does have a hint of Orange o. My skin type (pale)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much yet but it&#x27;s working really good!</li>
    <li> This product is quite bad, not only did it cause me to breakout, but it literally gave me zero tan, I mean zero.  I use self tanners frequently and am quite a connoisseur, I would not order this product if I were you!</li>
    <li> Okay so I was able to test out  Thermalabs organic self tanner on vacation and i can honestly  I LOVE IT!!! not only did it  look realistic and natural it lasted the  7 days+ i will be ordering it all summer long!!! Cant say enough good things about it highly recommend and i&#x27;ve tried all types of self tanner and i like this best!</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it LOVE IT!!!!  One application and I saw a significant difference. I will def. continue purchasing this product as the others I have tried made me orange.  FIVE STARS!!!</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s healthier than other tanners, but it needs to WORK irrespective of it&#x27;s natural or unnatural status.  I wish I was lucky like the other reviewers to get color from this.  I am a self-tanner from way back, so I know exactly what to do to get the best result.  It looked like I put absolutely nothing on my skin -- like it was just normal lotion.  Before using this product, I tried a natural product called Chocolate Sun which worked really well, but it made me stink like crazy.  I didn&#x27;t smell at all with this product, but I also didn&#x27;t get any color.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Hate it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this self tanner, I am absolutely addicted! It gave me a beautiful glow to start and about 4 hours after I had applied it I had a natural looking tan. I did have to do 2 applications to get the tan a little darker. But the thing I really liked was that there were no streaks. The results were even and beautiful! I have tried different self tanners and this is definitely one of my favorite. I also like the size!</li>
    <li> This product is falsely advertised as an &amp;#34;overnight sunless tanner&amp;#34; when it really should be called a gradual self tanner. The color after the first use is BARELY noticeable and you have to use it at least 3 days in a row to really see a difference. Half the small bottle was finished after three or four uses, so the price is definitely not worth it, even at the sale price of $19.99. I do like that it&#x27;s made from organic ingredients, but the smell is very perfumey and just terrible. It kind of defeats the purpose of it being a natural product. Get rid of the horrible perfumey smell! I also liked that it doesn&#x27;t stain white sheets, but that&#x27;s to be expected without an instant bronzer. Overall, would definitely NOT purchase again for that price.</li>
    <li> Received this product promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Works FANTASTIC.  I applied first day and within 3 hours  voila  tan.  I also applied the second day and had a darker tan.  Did not streak&lt;br /&gt;after first day application.  Is not orangey either.  I have tried products that Hollywood people use and this is even better by far.&lt;br /&gt;This product is super super.....price is fabulous for organic.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase more soon...</li>
    <li> Nice color....no orange or streaks!!</li>
    <li> Really orange color, not natural looking.</li>
    <li> I bought this and made sure the read all of the tips and instructions. I exfoliated and I bought latex gloves as one of the emails tips i received said to use them or an application mitt. Immediately when I started applying with the gloves i realized that wasn&#x27;t going to work. So I decided to just use my hands but I would pause after small sections and do a thorough washing of hands and nails. then i would apply to another section (leg, wash, leg, wash, torso, wash, etc...)  this process worked fine and did not make my hands blotchy, although it took a little longer. I will be purchasing an application mitt. The color is very even and it happens gradually.  It&#x27;s by far the best i have ever used!! It won&#x27;t make you super dark with the first application but I can already tell that this will not be a hassle to do once or twice a week.  I&#x27;m grateful i found this product!!</li>
    <li> Loved it! I bought it because of the reviews, reviews don&#x27;t lie. The product is easy to apply because it&#x27;s lotion, not makeup like other self tanners, just follow the instructions. I tried it on a small area on my thigh and next day I saw it tanned, not fake tan but a nice natural one. I applied it and I loved the results, summer&#x27;s coming!! After a long winter! Would definitely buy again!!&lt;br /&gt;One precaution: wash your hands after applying and wait for the product to absorb, because it can stain your clothes, but it does wash away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I got an allergic reaction to the product. I stopped using it as it wasn&#x27;t summer yet. Now I applied it again, before it didn&#x27;t cause any problem, so I didn&#x27;t do a patch test again. I got a mild reaction with itchiness and mild rash (like patches here and there, nothing unsightly) I thought I try the patch test the next day, I tried it, waited for 72 h and showed no reaction so I applied the product again and got a worse reaction... I really liked this product. But applying the product to a small area didn&#x27;t show the kind of reaction I would have gotten, so you better try this product before you plan on showing off some skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m probably about as pasty as they come- you know you&#x27;ve got serious pale girl problems when the lightest shade of foundation is too dark, okay? I&#x27;m not even an &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m more a &amp;#34;corpse white&amp;#34; but, sadly, vampires don&#x27;t have a make up line so I&#x27;m left to literally mix white Halloween make up with a foundation so my face matches the rest of my body when I go out. I do, however, tan a fantastic shade of brown and was lucky enough to pass this on to each of my seasonally pasty children.&lt;br /&gt;This is hard work, however, and I&#x27;m a mother of four now- if I had time to tan, I would use it to catch up on the Mountains of Madness aka my light and dark laundry pile. I&#x27;ll either walk around looking gaunt or I&#x27;ve got to go with a self tanner. I would much rather use a sunless tanning method, as I&#x27;m not capable of investing hours in the sun to tan naturally and I don&#x27;t want to use tanning beds, but I don&#x27;t like slathering my entire body in a chemical soup in order to not look like my brand of sunblock is called roof.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I was sent a bottle of Thermalabs organic self tanner free for review and discovered that not all sunless tanning products on the market are made up of complete garbage. I will note, however, that &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; is included on the label and that is the last thing that I want to see included when I&#x27;m buying something for the organic attributes. I would rather it had no scent, or even a somewhat unpleasant one, than include synthetic ones and I was disappointed to see that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few different sunless tanning options and I&#x27;ve ended up every colour from orange to Obama- I can honestly say that Thermalabs was one of the best self tanners and I&#x27;ve taken a billion photos to try to get a decent shot. I can&#x27;t really capture the bronzed brown of my hand now but, just note, this colour is more brown in person than gold or orange;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, there&#x27;s a massive difference and I intentionally did only the top of one of my hands because this was the easiest way to show a before and after for you. That was two thin coats and, looking back, one would have sufficed but I worried that I had washed some of it off so I applied a second. I&#x27;m going to have to do my whole body now, which the bottle will cover without issue, and I&#x27;m going to be darker than I have in years. We&#x27;ll have to see how this goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Thermalabs provides a product that contains more natural ingredients than any other on the market, it&#x27;s safe for all skin types and the application was not streaky or difficult in any way. If you&#x27;re someone who invests in these types of products on a regular basis, I would definitely recommend checking this one out. I like the shimmer of the brown, as it looks more sun-kissed than Kardashian-kissed and doesn&#x27;t go overboard with bronzers. The tanner dries fairly quickly, smells less offensive than any other tanner that I have used in the past, and they sell it with a money back guarantee. I have no complaints, with the exception of the &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; addition, and I will leave you with these words of advice; If you can&#x27;t tone it, tan it.nds because this was the easiest way to show a before and after for you.

    <li> After this cold winter I was really happy to try this product for a review.&lt;br /&gt; I hate the pale pasty look being inside gives us in the winter.&lt;br /&gt; I received this and It had a very nice guide to download with it.&lt;br /&gt;I read how to exfoliate my skin, the proper way of caring for the tan after i used the product.&lt;br /&gt; Also read about how to build up gradually on the tanned look.&lt;br /&gt;So first time was a very mild tan,though i am sorta medium bronze skin to start with. This will take a couple applications for it to work as intended. The best part is, no more ORANGE. So many times i have used a tanning product and looked orange or been streaked. With this product I was neither. I definitely recommend this product but set realistic expectations. It will take more than one application to get really dark. But you look natural that way,not one day white,then next day deep bronze.</li>
    <li> Product is great I have a slightly olive complexion and the product gave me a nice subtle but noticeable tan color. It&#x27;s actually what I wanted with it being the winter months and not having the time to take a vacation this was perfect to boost my self esteem because when I am out of the sun I can look sick and drained. This gave me the healthy color I needed. I liked that this was a heavy lotion as well because with the winter months my skin tends to be drier than usual. Now it&#x27;s not heavy where you feel sticky. My skin actually felt smooth and moisturized. I made sure to rub the product in until it wasn&#x27;t sticky anymore as directed.&lt;br /&gt;For someone who used to work at a tanning salon for 3 years and did custom airbrush tans on clients this product met my high standards.&lt;br /&gt;Obviously you have to do follow the proper steps. I showered, exfoliated my body with a body scrub because you always want to remove any dead skin, I paid extra attention to my elbows as they are my dry spot, knees and around my ankles. Then dried off and instantly applied the lotion to ensure my skin would absorb effectively. I also made sure the room was a comfortable temperature so my pores stayed open to absorb properly.&lt;br /&gt;Then air dried for about 15minutes to be safe then went to bed. I do have purple sheets so I can&#x27;t say if it rubbed off.&lt;br /&gt;I loved that I did not stink and my skin felt great in the morning and I looked refreshed by the increased color change.&lt;br /&gt;I am actually going to buy one for my mother who has very pale skin, burns in the sun easily as she is always getting frustrated with in store tanning products. I am hopeful it will work wonders on her as well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! So easy to apply and no smell to it at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best self-tanner I&#x27;ve come across (mostly, read on) for several reasons. First, I looove that it is organic and doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals and nasty stuff. Second, the color is remarkably beautiful. I am fair and really, really picky and this color just blows me away. I have used Alba, Nature&#x27;s Gate, one other natural one I picked up at Whole Foods, and Carribbean Colors (which was my favorite until this one). All the others had an orange tint, some more than others. Carribbean Colors had the least, and I didn&#x27;t think it did until I used this and this came out truly brown. A really nice brown. The first application wasn&#x27;t enough coverage so I did another the following day and then after about 8 hours, the result was gorgeous and what I wanted. No streaks (I did exfoliate the first time), no blotches. I&#x27;ve noticed that as the color wares off (I went maybe 5-6 days without applying), it gets blotchy, and that can also be because it had been a while since I did a thorough exfoliation. IMO, Carribbean Colors was easier to apply because it didn&#x27;t gather in some places as much as this (feet, ankles, hands) to the point I didn&#x27;t have to wash that off my hands at all. But this I must be careful to wash my hands. Then, sadly I noticed a line across my wrists where  the color began and ended. What a bummer. I&#x27;ve tried the entire bottle to put just a little color on the tops of my hands and blend the coloring on my wrists but it has been unsuccessful so far. Same with my feet. CC colored my feet easily and consistently, but this doesn&#x27;t. Other than that, I love love love the color of this, and oh it DOES NOT SMELL AT ALL. Not one little bit. At. All. I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but it doesn&#x27;t. Also, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing or sheets that I&#x27;ve noticed. Will reorder and try to correct the feet and hands situation. Also tried the residue left on my hands from application onto my face and it came out beautifully, I felt like I didn&#x27;t even need to wear foundation or makeup (I exfoliated right before on my face).dation or makeup (I exfoliated right before on my face).</li>
    <li> I am in love with this tanner! I have never seen my skin look like I actually have a tan and not colored some kind of unnatural orange color. I do not tan under any circumstances, and this tanner really looks natural! I have had so many compliments about the natural look, I only have to use it once a week and it lasts and looks fresh the whole time. There is no bad smell and it gradually darkens overnight for that perfect color. I will never use any other brand self tanning lotion again!&lt;br /&gt;I had to come back and upload a couple photos after I have used it more than once. I use it only twice a week and I am able to maintain a perfectly light golden color that actually looks like it is natural. If we&#x27;re to use it more often it would look fake because I am so fair skinned. This is seriously the best tanner have used and the Ultamitt really makes all the difference when you are applying, completely streak free every time!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I used one pump of regular body lotion and  one pump of this product, mix together in my hand and apply and gives a nice natural looking color for me.  I have only used this product on my legs.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING !!  My test was to see if it came off all over your clothes or sheets,&amp; IT DIDN&#x27; T !! I WAS SO HAPPY !!  The color is BEAUTIFUL, it looks just like a REAL TAN !!  Your skin looks so MOISTERIZED &amp; GLOWING !!! This is ABSOLUTELY going to be my only product from now on. Thank You SO MUCH THERMALABS for this product !!  I LOVE IT !!!</li>
    <li> I tried the Thermalab self tanning towelettes, which was my 1st experience with self tanning and was pleased with the application and non streaky look.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is a white cream color and the application is even easier than the tanning towelettes. I was worries again about an un even application or orange look, you know the fake tan look. I am happy to report this is not the case! Once again a great application and great finish!&lt;br /&gt;Another great plus it the not so oooooh you must have just tanned look and smell I have seen on friends. There is no fake tan smell that I have noticed. It does not rub off onto your clothes either.&lt;br /&gt;To apply you should obviously apply to clean dry skin, preferably freshly exfoliated. I did this and applied the lotion with my hands to my legs and finished up my nighttime skin care routine and drying my hair. By the time I was done with that I was ready for bed. It is recommended that you do not have any clothing on the areas of application for approx 20 min. This will ensure no patchy look.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and happy it is a very natural look. I am loving the second day application for the more sun kissed look as well. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> After one application, I have a very even tan which does not have an orange tone like so many OTC brands.  Very pleased with the quality of &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; with just one application.</li>
    <li> I am a pale, freckled whitey and this gave a nice color. it&#x27;s a smooth lotion so it&#x27;s easy to put on and smells fine. All tanning lotions give me the burned flesh smell...I just deal with it. The only issue that I do have is that it only last a couple of days before fading (unevenly). It does give nice color, so it&#x27;s not a total waste but it is my honest opinion that there is a store bought brand that colors nicely like this and has the same fading issue that is quite a bit cheaper. Sorry. I did exfoliate before and moisturize afterward. I&#x27;ve become quite the pro at self tanning, So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the application process. I do appreciate that it is organic. I could not find it on the skin deep app but the aforementioned one was rated very poorly on skin deep due to the chemicals so there&#x27;s that...</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Thermalabs Organic Self-Tanner last week, and wanted to wait until I tried for a full week. All I can say is wow! It really gives a bronzed, natural looking color. Very easy to rub into skin and has a nice light scent, &amp; doesn&#x27;t have that odd scent that appears hours later like other self-tanner products.  What I thought was very nice was that Cindy the Senior Customer Service Rep contacted me to make sure I liked the tanner, and if I had any questions, etc. She also emailed me their imformative guide on the world of self-tanners.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Builds a great tan and looks natural.  It smells wonderful and i love the fact that it is natural and organic.  Drys and absorbes fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait a long time before you get dressed or go to bed.  My new favorite self tanner!</li>
    <li> Great color and more importantly, NO bad smell.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Contains DHA.  I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Everyone wants to know where I got my tan - I do not tan anymore (haven&#x27;t for years) - it looks great and does last a week.</li>
    <li> fantastic tanner.. very natural looking and long lasting!  will definitely be buying again.  doesn&#x27;t look orange and doesn&#x27;t have that horrible tanner smell that so many do.  Buy it... you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Like the product price increased from first time I viewed it. Covers well, not streaky.</li>
    <li> Great color, great smell, super moisturizing. It would be even better if it had an instant bronzer, but I&#x27;m still very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Fine product that has no &amp;#34;orangy&amp;#34; effect, produces results quickly and stays on.  Wear gloves and smooth the product on thoroughly and with overlapping, circular strokes.  No objectional smell, no streaks.</li>
    <li> Very pleased! I usually use Victoria Secret self tan daily, I read review after review and kept coming back to this product! And I&#x27;m glad I did! I showered and exfoliated last night, ( after not using any kind of tanning products thought out the week) applied the lotion, which smells great! In small sections and rubbed in in circular motion. Let dry applied my usual body lotion( forever after) and went to bed.. Woke up this morning looking perfectly bronze! I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product, and will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Love it, looks natural! Lasts almost a week~Worth every penny</li>
    <li> This is hands down the BEST sunless tanning product I&#x27;ve used, and being a true &amp;#34;white guy&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve tried a bunch. The fact it is mostly organic and all natural is a bonus, but this is more like a skin lotion than a tanning agent. It goes on smoothy, gives a very natural tan that really keeps it&#x27;s color for over a week. No other product ever lasted this long.&lt;br /&gt;Would give it 6 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Love it just ordered two more</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands, &amp; all of them had some odor &amp; would rub off, especially if you sweat/got wet...not this one!  it looks just as good as a real suntan!  Love that it is a natural/organic lotion that goes on smooth &amp; easy, blends well, absorbs/dries fast, has no bad smell at all, doesn&#x27;t rub off, &amp; looks REAL! The customer service is excellent with great tips &amp; 100% money-back guarantee.</li>
    <li> I just love it!!! It actually works and it looks so natural! I&#x27;m so happy with this product! Definitely the best so far... Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Best self tanner I ever used.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE it.  I try to stay out of the sun so I have used a lot of self tanners.  This one is by far the BEST!</li>
    <li> This is the first tanning lotion I have ever tired and it is amazingggg! Everybody keeps complimenting me on my beautiful glowing skin and ask where I&#x27;ve been going for my tanning. It takes a few times to apply to get to a nice color. Looks like I&#x27;ve been in the sun all summer long :)</li>
    <li> Does the job, don&#x27;t like the smell. I wasn&#x27;t planning on leaving this review, but they kept emailing me to see how I liked their product, when I finally replied saying that I wasn&#x27;t particularly happy with it, they said oh well...we will let you know if we come up with a better product... They talk so much about 100% customer satisfaction, they should have offered a better solution I think...</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner! I used Tan Towels but didn&#x27;t love the ingredients or the scent but it did the job and gave my white skin a nice glow. I went on a search for a safer alternative being pregnant and then breastfeeding and found ThermaLabs. I love the scent and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and just bought the towelettes to try too.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that it did not give me a darker tan but will be perfect for those who are not looking for a dark tan. It goes on without being greasy and there is no odor to it, which I liked!</li>
    <li> this is definitely one of the best and easiest self tanner that I used.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging itself is very convenient, it came with a pump and the bottle is see through.&lt;br /&gt;For me that is always a plus, since a pump makes it easier to dispense the product and the you can see right through the bottle how much you have left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a particular scent, for me this is not a big deal, the scent is very mild.&lt;br /&gt;I applied my self tanner in the morning and I see a difference after a few hours, the tan is gradual and that is something that is good for people who wants to set the proper tan shade for them.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a several days now and applied it twice a day, now I was able to build up the nicest shade of tan that I want.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use, you just need to apply it all over the areas you want to be tanned, and wait for the magic to happen.&lt;br /&gt;The tan isnt something that fades away really fast, it stays for a week or so. I love it and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this using a promo code for testing.</li>
    <li> Reminded me of Qt from the 1960&#x27;s. I followed the directions just like the said snd even had their mitt to out it in with . It stained my clothes my white macarame purse and my sheets. I woukd not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> I loved the self tanner. It does not make you look orange. I already had a base tan from tanning and it is keeping my tan so I can have it all winter and not ruin my skin as much in the tanning bed. I may tan 1 day a week now with the lotion inbetween. I loved it and it spread easily and dries almost instantly.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have ever tried...it lasts a long time and didn&#x27;t come off in the shower!!  There is NO nasty smell and I believe it is the only one I have ever used that if you had to you could use your hands without gloves!  I hope they keep it at this price point!</li>
    <li> I use self tanner very often and wanted to try something new. By reading the reviews I thought I would get great results after one use. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see the slightest change :-\</li>
    <li> Good product that is free of oxybenzone and parabens that can be harmful to your health.  I had been using Neutrogena until I saw it contained these additives, as do most tanning products being sold. If what you are using has these additives, beware of the potential harm to your endocrine system and body!  This product is also fragrance free which is another big plus.</li>
    <li> Thermalabs rock! I am a big fan and I use their towelettes and lotion once a week. Highly recommended as the best brand, the best results AND the best customer service. If you&#x27;re looking for the best self tanner - this is it!</li>
    <li> In the winter my skin became very pale. With this product I got a natural tan color. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have never self-tanned before, but this was so easy I will be &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; more often. For the first time ever I don&#x27;t glow in the dark. I&#x27;m pale white and this product work to a perfect glow with only one application. This is a must have for anyone wanting that golden tan without all the sun damage.</li>
    <li> Love love the product</li>
    <li> I received my tanning lotion on time. I&#x27;m finally using it and I love it! It didn&#x27;t leave streaks, I don&#x27;t look orange, doesn&#x27;t have a strong tanning lotion smell (in fact it sorta fades away) it&#x27;s moisturizing and absorbs quickly!! I had results by the next day! Oh and it doesn&#x27;t transfer to your sheets/clothing. Amazing product! Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;*As always, with any sunless tanning lotion make sure you EXFOLIATE BEFORE you put this on your body otherwise you risk getting blochiness, possible streaks or darker areas.</li>
    <li> you get GREAT color!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this self tanner!!</li>
    <li> The over all body was evenly spread out... But it left my hands, feet, neck, and knees Orange(r). I had really high expectations after reading the reviews, so that might be partially why I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars. The first 2 days looked decient enough, But the morning of the 3rd my chest and arms looked streaky. Its almost summer so I&#x27;m not to worried, looks like I&#x27;m going to have to get a tan the hard way.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Works great!! Beautiful, natural results! Easy to use too!!</li>
