<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The scent (smell) goes away very, very soon; that never happened with the originals I had purchased in the stores before, that makes me question the authenticity of this perfume; I will not buy again and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I commend you for being a company would be responsible and accomplished for their clients expect us to go ahead and many successes. christos smanis</li>
    <li> LOVE this scent!!! It smells fresh and clean. I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in my department store but thankful that Amazon was carrying it. I will buy again. I hope Amazon keeps this brand. I like it better than the other Calvin Klein scents but it&#x27;s a personal preference. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I am a perfume freak! This is an ol&#x27;time favorite.  Packaging was great, nicely wrap with tissue paper and placed in a Calvin Klein box.  The scent is all day lasting and the lotion is nice and light spreads easily.  Compliments every time I wear Escape!  Would definitely order again for this price!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a present for my mother. She loved it. It was an excellent size and an excellent price. If you have a woman who loves Escape; then I would recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> I have worn this purfume for year and it still smells great.  I wil continue to wear it as long as it is around.</li>
    <li> Calvin Klein discontinued Escape .... my favorite standby for years...  this is a nice product (seems to last as long as the real stuff) but its not the real stuff,  I would purchase it again because I love the original but it is a \\&quot;reproduction\\&quot;  the product lables are all wrong.</li>
    <li> I received the merchandise yesterday and while I am sure it is okay the price charged me is WRONG!  I am not willing to pay the $85.00 on the bill when this item was marked down on the Amazon website.  I will be calling today to report this but it is disappointing that I now have to take my time to follow up your mistake.</li>
    <li> I buy this for myself every year</li>
    <li> I wore Escape in the 90&#x27;s as my signature fragrance. I came across this great deal after seeing the perfume alone for way more than this on another beauty site. Received package quickly and was perfect. Smells like I remember, very clean, you only have to use a very little of both these products for the scent payoff. A classic, I wonder though if they changed anything, it is made by Coty prestige for CK. I can&#x27;t really tell if they did.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance! I get lots of compliments and consistently asked, &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Did not like this fragrance at all-</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and by ordering it on line it was half the price I normally pay. The lotion is very running and has a very strong scent but I bought the set as it is cheaper than buying the perfume on its own. Received shipment in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Shopping in Lenox Square Mall, Atlanta, GA in the fragrance department of Rich&#x27;s, I was purchasing my favorite cologne at the time, Calvin Klein Eternity for Women.  The perfume sales associate asked me to smell Calvin Klein&#x27;s new fragrance, Escape.  The scent was breathtaking.  Of course, I purchased it as well.  When the Eternity bottle was empty, I sprayed on Escape and haven&#x27;t changed since.  I have people that knew me years ago, and, today, they will say to me...\\&quot;I knew you were here somewhere because I can smell you, you always smell soooo good.\\&quot; There is not a day that goes by that someone doesn&#x27;t ask me for the name of my fragrance! I have moved to another state, and Escape is extremely hard to find. However, after a strong twenty-year relationship and the determination to keep smelling this way as long as I can, I have found a cheaper, more economical way to have my favorite fragrance.....thanks to Amazon.

    <li> Huge lotion and cologne for unbelievable price.  I am delighted.  Thanks Amazon for all your fabulous deals!</li>
    <li> I LOVE WEARING ESCAPE, IT IS MY #1 SCENT !!!!</li>
    <li> this perfume has been my favorite for over 15 years.  I use other fragances but this is the best for me.  The smell is just right for my skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume, hard to find, especially in the gift set with lotion.  Priced nicer than it used to at my Mall</li>
    <li> The perfume is disappointing. I do not even smell it after about 10-15 minutes! The lotion is silky smooth and the fragrance lasts quite awhile. Just wish the perfume had the same longevity!</li>
    <li> I received this item in good condition and the products are of the volume described.  But the perfume itself does not smell identical to the dept. store quality Escape perfume.  I purchased this because I was running out of Escape and thought it was a great deal; however, the perfume is very faint and different than the original product.</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars if I was female and used it. Bought it by special request from a friend and the amazon price was way much reasonable than the retail price.</li>
    <li> I got the set and I am so pleased with it. I carry a little bottle for touch ups when I am out.</li>
    <li> I used to wear Calvin Klein Escape every day.  Got to be too expensive.  Now, I can buy it (plus body lotion!) at an amazing price and it&#x27;s as wonderful as I remember.  The scent is fresh, clean and you don&#x27;t need to use very much so it&#x27;ll last me a long time.  I&#x27;m so very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance of all time! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore but found it on Amazon and at a bargain price. Thank you Amazon for having items we still love and want!!!</li>
    <li> I love my Escape perfume. I have been using it for years Great price. I am Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> She wore it on a date, I asked what it was, she got more for valentines day.  Sexy and Sophisticated, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne - always has been, and I cannot find it in the department stores or drug stores anymore - love it!!</li>
    <li> Dissapointed in this product from this vendor.  Lotion was not full; missing about a quarter of its contents, and did not have time to return and ask for replacement.  For the time it took to receive, due to the fact that I was not given the option to ship ups and it shipped via US Postal Service, and the fact that the body lotion was not full - was not worth saving a few dollars.  Would not buy again - better off going to authorized retailer for this.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, great value...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Calvin Klein products. I bought it for a birthday gift and am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> To someone like a mom to me.  She absolutely LOVES this fragrance and mentioned not being able to find it anymore.  So I was more than happy to find it on Amazon.  And she was ecstatic about receiving it as a gift!</li>
    <li> I order for my wife and I got on time for her birthday  she love this perfume  she is so happy</li>
    <li> Iove this perfume and am so disappointed they have taken it from the department stores.  .</li>
    <li> Love Escape!!!! Have been buying from an upscale department store at a much higher price. Got lotion too at a smaller price!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve run out and found this great deal. Everywhere I go, everyone I meet, male/female, kids, etc....makes comments about how good I smell!! I love Escape and it is mostly a day-time scent but I pulled it off at night as well. I keep the mini ones in my purse but I can&#x27;t find them anywhere anymore....It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I remember my mini ones working. I would try a small one first.</li>
    <li> My favorite  - I always receive compliments on my fragrance &#x3D;</li>
    <li> love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
    <li> a great buy she loved it</li>
    <li> Escape by Calvin Klein for Women is a classic.  It&#x27;s not to strong and not to soft.....Just right for anytime of the day or night</li>
    <li> IF YOU LOVE TIS FRAGRANCE, LIKE I DO, HAS BEEN MY SIGNATURE FRANGRANCE, A STAPLE SINCE IT CAME OUT, YOU KNOW HOW SUNKEN YOUT HEART FEELS TO GO INTO A BELK OR DILLARDS TO HEAR, WE NO LONGER CARRY THIS.  I HAVE TO HAVE THIS CK FRANGRANCE., MY STAPLE, SIGNATURE, MOST COMPLIMENTED AND MADE FOR ME FRAGRANCE.. NOW I HAVE TO FIND IT., NO IDEA WHY THEY DON&#x27;T PRODUCE OR DELL IT BU I WANT TO ORDER EVERY ONE I SEE OUT OF FEAR!</li>
    <li> I have used Escape for many years and always get compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> Escape is the best smell ever, makes you wanna attack everytime she wears it. Try it, you will love it. Nice fresh clean fragrance!</li>
    <li> I know this is an older cologne. But I love it. I get more complements when I am wearing it, that is enough to re-order, except it is my all time favorite and I will never stop buying it.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money! It&#x27;s a watered down version of the original! I have been wearing this perfume for over 10 years. I know what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like and how long it lasts. This wore off quickly and had a sweet scent to it. I had some left from the one I bought at Macy&#x27;s and had other people compare the scent.. NOT the same! Don&#x27;t buy from this company.. They only want to rip you off!</li>
    <li> Oh my Goodness, I love, love, love this scent, its from years ago but man there is nothing else like it so glad I found this again</li>
    <li> Escape is my signature I love Escape by Calvin Klein.</li>
    <li> I was glad to be able to find this perfume set for my mother as that&#x27;s what she wanted. Nice to be able to get it online.</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD AS I REMEMBERED.  FOR THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY I WILL STICK TO TIFFANY.  i CAN BUY LOCAL AND IT DOESN&#x27;T COST MUCH MORE.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, period!</li>
    <li> Every day I&#x27;m asked,&amp;#34;What are you wearing&amp;#34;, by men and women. You spray lightly in the morning and still smell the Escape Parfum  before going to bed. It is a light smell one that makes them want to get closer, to inhale just one more time....Thank god I can still get it. Macy&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore so thank you for making my day start off on the right foot.</li>
    <li> Christmas prezzie for my mom.  She was very happy.  :)</li>
    <li> needing a gift for christmas, this was on my daughters gift list. i couldnt fine Escape at a store, so i found this on Amazon. and with me a being a prime member, made it a real good bargain.</li>

    <li> I buy this Escape set every year for my daughter as a Christmas gift she loves this perfume it is all she wears I am very satisfied with the results such as the expression on her face! I look forward to buying it again</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance and I was so disappointed when they stopped selling it in the major department stores.  Thank goodness I can still find it at Amazon.com.  I hope I will be able to buy it for many years to come.  I have not found anything I like better.</li>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t had Escape products since 1995.  When the package arrived in wonderful &amp; safe packaging, I was so excited to open it!  Immediately a test spritz and a smidge of the lotion was just perfect!  Everybody, both men and women asked &amp;#34;what kind of perfume are you wearing, you smell soooo good?&amp;#34;  I hadn&#x27;t been asked that in years!  The items are huge for the exceptional price!  I look forward to getting showered and dressed each morning to be embraced by such a spectacular scent!</li>
