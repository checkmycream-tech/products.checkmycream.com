    <li> Not really pleased with the natural color of the hair. It&#x27;s more brown than black and there wasn&#x27;t any other color option in hair to choose from. It&#x27;s also more 12\\&quot; rather than a 14\\&quot;. It was an overall disappointment</li>
    <li> it looks exactly like on the picture, i would recommend this to anyone and the other thing is u receive your hair within a week..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the hair, true texture is soft and inches are very long. I&#x27;m a hairstylist and the service was fast and great. I spoke with the person who would be sending the hair and they are nice to customers. Three bundle are thick , hair is just great!!</li>
    <li> Hair looked nice but it Shed a lot. By 1 month, almost half the hair was gone. Would not recommend. Would not use again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toss up on what you get ! This to the hair is awesome . Delivery was super fast !! Thank you</li>
    <li> Hair is soft and tangle free but extremely thin. Two bundles looks like 1. Not worth the money. The length seems a couple inches shorter than the 14&#x27; I ordered bc the ends are so thin.</li>
    <li> this hair is wonderful and it arrived in no time, I have had it in for about a week and it seems I can do most anything with it. minimal shedding and not much tangling AT ALL. im enjoying it.</li>
    <li> The hair was wonderful but I didn&#x27;t order enough. Should have ordered three bundles. I would order this again. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ordered this hair on Tuesday received it on Friday. Ran my fingers through the hair and it did not shed or tangle. The hair is beautiful and so far it seems like good hair. I ordered 2 14 inches but will be ordering 1 more bundle just to have a full sew in.</li>
    <li> AAAAAAAAAAAA + + + + + + +</li>
    <li> I was super excited when I came across this hair, because I&#x27;m a hairdresser, but this product is not what&#x27;s being advertised.. This item is far from being virgin brazilian remy, The texture don&#x27;t even appear to be human.</li>
    <li> The worst hair, ever. It tangled and my hair was always a mess. It was rarely ever straight. The worst part was that whenever I brushed it, hair would come out. I shed all the time!</li>
    <li> Sent me the wrong hair; sent body wave instead of straight. Opened the package to try to use it anyway and the hair shed terribly couldn&#x27;t even use it. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money..</li>
    <li> it was good going on but after the first shampoo it was a different texture..will take it out soon .it has not even been a month..</li>
    <li> The hair is good but not to be bleach</li>
    <li> I have ordered this hair twice and have gotten compliments of how good it looks. It does sheds a bit even after sealing the weft but it is something I can deal with. It does tangle a bit but finger combing gets it out unlike some other hair. I had the hair in for about 3-4 weeks and it still looked good. Though I have ordered other hair before and the sellers have told me it is natural and able to dye I have done it and after trying to bleach, the hair does not change color at all, but THIS HAIR does. I did a test and tried a few strands and did the rest of the hair ombré and it came out great. It took the bleach so great and it didn&#x27;t even damage the hair. It still had the same luster and everything. The shedding didn&#x27;t change but it&#x27;s minimal just a few strands. I ordered the same hair twice at different times and both bundles were exactly the same and was able to take the bleach well. I was able to use the 1st 3 bundles, shampooing and condition after bleaching it and it was fine. For cheap hair this is the best hair I&#x27;ve used and is better than some of the expensive brands.</li>
    <li> This hair tangled up really bad. I had to take it out after only one week it was vey frizzy. I use Brazilian Remy all the time.</li>
    <li> There is no way this is remy. Poor quality bad texture sheds mats easily. Had to take out after 1 week of wearing it.</li>
    <li> Hair tangled.  Was not soft.</li>
    <li> The hair is very soft  and manageable the color matches my hair and it looks very native I love it</li>
    <li> This hair is NOT real brazilian I waisted my money and wish I could&#x27;ve got it back because this product did not deserve it</li>
    <li> i actually like it and yes it does shed but i dont care people say all weave sheds, I had it in for 2 months and it was just as full and thick as it was when i first put it in. I guess it depends on how you take care of your hair. Once i washed it it was good as new. Only thing i would say i didnt like is that it would get this weird curl even if i straightened it</li>
    <li> Horrible product! It wAs synthetic hair! The worst I have ever used! The should be put out if business for false advertising.</li>
    <li> It was decent hair cause I mixed it with some very expensive hair so it worked but soon as it got dirty it was over as far as that bouncy beautiful look and after I washed it it wasn&#x27;t the same secondly I had to split the wept cause it was extra thick which gave me more hair&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the biggest disappointment was they sent me 1b which looked like a 2 it&#x27;s brown as ever brown enough to look like highlights but I made it work</li>
    <li> After all was said and done golden perfect customer service is not bad sorry about everything</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok hair.... will order again thought is would shed a lot, however it didn&#x27;t  as what I read in previous reviews</li>
    <li> Its was very nice for the price would purchase again definitely</li>
    <li> Very thin and straggly looking. Length was 12 inch and I ordered 14 inch. Poor quality and waste of money. Thought I&#x27;d try it because some of the reviews were ok and it was a decent price.  Definitely a waste of money though.</li>
