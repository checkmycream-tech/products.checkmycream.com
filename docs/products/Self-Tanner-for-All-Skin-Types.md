<li> I always get compliments on how tan and natural this lotion makes me look and it lasts quite a few uses!</li>
<li> It has a very natural color (I&#x27;m a redhead); it&#x27;s very easy to apply; the smell isn&#x27;t awful (although it does smell like sunless tanner); one of these 8 oz bottles will last almost all summer for me when I do it every 4 or 5 days.</li>

    <li> Really is a great alternative to tanning.  The product has no real over powering smells.  It is easy to rub on the skin, which helps to prevent that unwanted fake tan streaking.  I use it on my arms, chest, and face and the one bottle still lasts almost 6 months.  If you want the tan to last longer, follow the instructions to prep your skin which really consists of cleaning it well before application!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this tanning lotion! I always get compliments on how tan and natural this lotion makes me look and it lasts quite a few uses! It has a great price and for the price I&#x27;ve repurchased multiple times throughout the years.</li>
    <li> I am a former tan-a-holic and have tried so many self tanners &amp; this one is the best! The smell &amp; the color is fantastic!</li>
    <li> This product goes on smoothly and evenly downfall is doesn&#x27;t last a week like the claim I have to apply every other day @ least also this line has lots of defects like this pump was broken when I received it I&#x27;ve also tried handy tan sprayer do not buy!! Had it replaced 3 times still didn&#x27;t work so stick with the tanning cream vs the spray version</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bees knees of sunless tanning lotions.  It&#x27;s my most favorite product ever!  I used to pay $25 for the larger bottle,  I believe it was the 24 oz bottle and I paid the same price for the 8 oz bottle.  Im not sure if their prices have just skyrocketed but you might be able to find it cheaper at a local discount salon.  I mix half lotion and half tanning lotion.  It makes it last longer and because it&#x27;s so dark it gives you a little more time to build up your color.</li>
    <li> Arrived before the arrival date. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Sun Labs. I&#x27;m fair skinned and it takes a while to even get a tan and I get compliments like no other when I put this on :)</li>
    <li> Wish the color was darker. Very hard for me to apply. Not a big fan of this at all. I will go back to VS self tanner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this and other sunless tanning lotion but this brand seems to change their formula often.  The current one I purchased in early 2015 has a better color development but I need gloves to apply it (or have to wash hands a few times).  When I am in a hurry in the morning, it is little annoying.</li>
    <li> The only tanning lotion I buy. Several of my friends are now believers of Sun. Need to order more as I&#x27;m always afraid it may be discontinued!</li>
    <li> works wonders! drys like normal lotion after an hour. not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> Really tans great!  Looks natural as far as what I&#x27;m told by others.</li>
    <li> By far the best tanner I&#x27;ve ever used! Goes on smooth and looks so natural! Make sure you use gloves though and be careful around knees, elbows, ankles, etc just like any other self tanner.</li>
    <li> the price is right smells great the color is perfect last 7 days to starts fading . I used rubber gloves to put on then took one glove off put on top of hand then did top of other hand then tan is perfect or top of hands are white. plus need gloves to put on or palm of hand is brown and can not get off. I shower before bed put on then let on over night then shower in morning perfect color. getting rid of tanning bed need something just as good this is it.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this product for me as I stopped going to tanning parlors 4 years ago, it works great, lasts relatively long and dries pretty fast. Just make sure you moisturize your elbows, knees and hands before using the product. As well, after it dries take a shower and let the guidecoat wearoff.</li>
    <li> I have used this self tanning lotion for years now and no one ever knew I used it because it looks so natural</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past, and have been very pleased.  However, this time the tan only seems to last until I shower, then it comes off.  Was wondering if I only ordered an instant tan lotion instead of one that last for a couple days.  However, while the color is on, it looks natural.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S BEEN MANY YEARS SINCE I&#x27;VE USED SELF TANNING LOTIONS.  THIS ONE IS BETTER THAN THE OLD KIND.  BLENDS IN PRETTY GOOD. HAVE TO PRACTICE PLACEMENT AROUND THE FOOT AREA TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE AUTHENIC.</li>
    <li> This is a great self tanner! It gives a nice instant color then darkens over several hours. I chose the dark shade because I have very pale skin. I apply before bed two times a week and it keeps my skin a nice light tan that is very natural. The scent is very light and nice. Once it dries it will not transfer. I sleep on light colored sheets and nothing has shown up on them. About a dime size amount does an entire leg so it will last me a while!</li>
    <li> Def one of the best tanning products out there and looks very natural. Not quite as dark as I thought it would be. Next time will buy very dark as this although it says very dark gives a medium tan but very good product!</li>
    <li> No streaking and looks so natural.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It has a very natural color (I&#x27;m a redhead); it&#x27;s very easy to apply; the smell isn&#x27;t awful (although it does smell like sunless tanner); one of these 8 oz bottles will last almost all summer for me when I do it every 4 or 5 days.</li>
    <li> I bought this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and when I got it, the pump was taped down with packaging tape and contents where all over the outside of the bottle.  Not too mention I get to pay for the shipping!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect self tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of sunless tanner.  I am very pleased that I tried out Sun Labs after many recommendations.  It was very easy to apply because it is tinted so you can see exactly where the tanner is going. Most sunless tanners have an unpleasant odor but sun labs has a very mild scent.  I would definitely purchase this product again and recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> works great but make sure to wash your hands immediately and do not leave in one spot too long.</li>
    <li> I like the color it looks really natural.</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of Sun Lab&#x27;s products. I received this bottle and it&#x27;s not the same. It is a watery, brown consistency and Sun Lab&#x27;s products have a green tint and it&#x27;s thicker consistency than this bottle I received.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning this bottle.</li>
    <li> love the color this gives me. nice natural glow!</li>
    <li> Best self tanner on the market.  Great seller, prompt shipping.  Thank you.</li>
