      <li>Great product, no mint or citric acid to to bother my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is unusal</li>
      <li>The price was good as well.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Peelu is an excellent produce that is perfect for people like me  who can not tolerate the taste of most toothpaste operating room the other additives that are put into those products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is especially important for those of us that have loved ones that are sensitive to the taste of mint.</li>
      <li>I love peelu toothpaste no flouride</li>
      <li>It is ok.</li>
      <li>Most toothpaste has fluoride, and thus int to cover</li>
      <li>Try it, you will love it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure you would get use to it</li>
      <li>Anyway, I was very excited to find Peelu and thought I had found the answer.</li>
      <li>Works great with sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>yeah it definitely had a taste and it wasn&#x27;t a good one!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been using it 5 months plus its cruelty free no animal testing.</li>
      <li>Used it to clean bathtub.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my teeth clean.</li>
      <li>He even used it to keep his teeth clean while going through two years of braces with no issues.</li>
      <li>After brushing your teeth, your mouth tastes fresh and clean but does not reek of mint.</li>
      <li>He LOVES it - and coming from him, that is a pretty fabulous rating.</li>
      <li>And not being very abrasive, it&#x27;s easy on my enamel.</li>
      <li>I am very allergic to Flouride and it is important for me to have found this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>The way this is advertised it appears to be very natural and sugar substitute free, however it does contain xylitol.</li>
      <li>Tastes and feels fine to me but for a young person with sensory issues this may not be the answer.</li>
      <li>Well, not so much.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my son who found any flavor in toothpaste absolutely revolting.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>He absolutely hates the flavor of name brand toothpaste until I ordered him this.  </li>
      <li>I will only use Peelu, I have receeding gums and need a very gentle cleaner</li>
      <li>I seem to be very sensitive to peppermint oil, and I also dislike toothpaste that foams.</li>
      <li>Once your get used to the flavor, since it&#x27;s not really sweet, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>My dad is fighting cancer and even before then his mouth was sensitive and out of sorts.  </li>
      <li>Ordered for all natural toothpaste.</li>
      <li>After trying virtually every children&#x27;s toothpaste on the market, I found that my 5 year old son will tolerate brushing his teeth with Peelu because it is practically unflavored.</li>
      <li>I read an article that said Peelu was a natural whitener</li>
      <li>and I only want to use natural products.</li>
      <li>This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive (including Sensodyne).</li>
      <li>It is different from other flouride-free toothpastes that I have tried in that it also has no flavoring and does very much what tooth paste should do.</li>

<li> Has a weird grainy feel to it.</li>
<li> TASTES TERRIBLE, but I would rather tolerate a few minutes of bad taste while brushing my teeth than to have the lingering flavor of MINT to ruin the taste of my morning coffee.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find a toothpaste which I like and which also protects my teeth with fluoride.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth and gave me bad breath and a cough</li>
<li> Bought for someone who hated mint.</li>
<li> It even has the nasty brown color to match the awful taste.</li>
<li> However, it has a horrible taste.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought for someone who hated mint. Has a weird grainy feel to it. Did not use but I&#x27;m sure you would get use to it</li>
    <li> I really like this toothpaste.  It seems to lather well.  I was looking for a mint-free toothpaste and this works perfectly.  The price was good as well.</li>
    <li> Peelu is an excellent produce that is perfect for people like me  who can not tolerate the taste of most toothpaste operating room the other additives that are put into those products. After brushing your teeth, your mouth tastes fresh and clean but does not reek of mint. Try it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> Once your get used to the flavor, since it&#x27;s not really sweet, it&#x27;s fine. And not being very abrasive, it&#x27;s easy on my enamel.</li>
    <li> I love peelu toothpaste no flouride and I get the spearmint flavor. It takes a while to get use to it but I&#x27;ve been using it 5 months plus its cruelty free no animal testing. I give it 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Gritty, yukky taste.  Used it to clean bathtub.</li>
    <li> TASTES TERRIBLE, but I would rather tolerate a few minutes of bad taste while brushing my teeth than to have the lingering flavor of MINT to ruin the taste of my morning coffee.  ~ Has NO lingering aftertaste, but a little ORANGE flavor added by the manufacturer would make this a toothpaste that I would buy again; ....AS IS, it is my LAST tube as I continue my search for mint/fluoride-free toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I read an article that said Peelu was a natural whitener so I bought this brand.  It didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth and gave me bad breath and a cough</li>
    <li> I am very allergic to Flouride and it is important for me to have found this toothpaste. It is different from other flouride-free toothpastes that I have tried in that it also has no flavoring and does very much what tooth paste should do. It helps keep my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who found any flavor in toothpaste absolutely revolting. We tried the organic toothpastes, bubble gum toothpastes, fruity toothpastes - no luck. Anyway, I was very excited to find Peelu and thought I had found the answer. Well, not so much. The texture and the flavor were bad enough so that the child used the toothpaste for about a week and then declared he couldn&#x27;t handle it any longer. However, since he had tried everything he decided to tough it out and return to a mint flavored toothpaste! So, in a sense it worked in getting my child to brush his teeth regularly but just not with this brand. He compared the flavor to mud and the texture as gritty. Tastes and feels fine to me but for a young person with sensory issues this may not be the answer.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t deal with the taste.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive (including Sensodyne).</li>
    <li> I have been using Peelu toothpaste for years and I love it! I will only use Peelu, I have receeding gums and need a very gentle cleaner and I only want to use natural products. I also find Peelu to be GREAT for sensitivity!</li>
    <li> I seem to be very sensitive to peppermint oil, and I also dislike toothpaste that foams. It&#x27;s very difficult to find a toothpaste which I like and which also protects my teeth with fluoride. This toothpaste satisfies the no-mint and no-foam criteria, but has no fluoride, and that knocks two points off my rating. The texture is a bit strange but I got used to that, but I still have not found a toothpaste that&#x27;s satisfactory for me.</li>
    <li> After trying virtually every children&#x27;s toothpaste on the market, I found that my 5 year old son will tolerate brushing his teeth with Peelu because it is practically unflavored.</li>
    <li> Great product, no mint or citric acid to to bother my stomach.&lt;br /&gt;Taste is unusal but you get use to it.</li>
    <li> Ordered for all natural toothpaste. However, it has a horrible taste. I still use it on occasion. But, do not like the taste.</li>
    <li> My dad is fighting cancer and even before then his mouth was sensitive and out of sorts.  He absolutely hates the flavor of name brand toothpaste until I ordered him this.  He LOVES it - and coming from him, that is a pretty fabulous rating.</li>
    <li> Works great with sensitive teeth</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend because he wanted &amp;#34;tasteless toothpaste&amp;#34; yeah it definitely had a taste and it wasn&#x27;t a good one! It even has the nasty brown color to match the awful taste. Him and his friend were both gagging and almost puked while brushing their teeth with this toothpaste. This product is not what it appears to be.</li>
    <li> It is without mint, but the taste of peelu needs some getting used to. It is ok.</li>
    <li> my son has sensory issues and will not brush his teeth with anything flavored but he likes this toothpaste.  thanks</li>
    <li> A near impossible combination to find. Most toothpaste has fluoride, and thus int to cover it&#x27;s chemical taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peelu, being fluoride-free, doesn&#x27;t- need to hide the taste of anything. Hence no need for mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is especially important for those of us that have loved ones that are sensitive to the taste of mint. Prior to finding this product, we could not get my autistic son to brush with anything but baking soda. Now that he is using Peelu, his dentist tells us his teeth are in excellent health. He even used it to keep his teeth clean while going through two years of braces with no issues.</li>
    <li> The way this is advertised it appears to be very natural and sugar substitute free, however it does contain xylitol. It also came in different packaging than the picture shows.</li>
