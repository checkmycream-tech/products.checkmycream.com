      <li>so I was very happy to find it in this manner.</li>
      <li>IT IS A VERY GOOD DEODORANT I HAVE USED IT SINCE I WAS 13</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>He was loved, respected and admired by too many that came to these conclusions, after his exit, which reaffirms for me, that he is in a better place!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Tussy deodorant since I was a young girl, this is the best deodorant that ever hit the market!  </li>
      <li>For me, it is the most effective antiperspriant on the matket.</li>
      <li>/&gt;to finally be able to purchase this ever-holding deodorant.</li>
      <li>am glad I found it on amozon.i am 57</li>
      <li>I also love the fragrances.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many off the shelf when I couldn&#x27;t find this one &amp; found it irreplaceable.</li>
      <li>AND NOTHING MORE.</li>
      <li>Glad there is still a trusty go to for him.</li>
      <li>Wish it was more readily available...</li>
      <li>It is kind to my skin and keeps me fresh all day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;A perfectly fine deodorant product that does what it is supposed to.  </li>
      <li>Taking a big chance on a great friendship, I bought it for a landscaping friend of mine in Fla.</li>
      <li>May he RIP, secure in the reality that he was truly a GOOD MAN doing so much for so many, unselfishly right up to the very end!</li>
      <li>and I am humbled by my role that was assigned to me in producing such a wonderful spirit who courageously faced an early date with death, trying to make life and this world a better place for all that he touched, so much that his mistakes in some very important choices are blessings that validate his right to do so.  </li>
      <li>A true stand up man,</li>
      <li>Erik C. Allen was a exceptional human being</li>
      <li>I was sad the day I stopped being able to find it in brick-and-mortar stores, but very happy to see it carried on</li>

      <li>is the only roll-on that I am able to use that has no allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>sure enough, he broke out in a rash n</li>
      <li>Tussy is the only antiperspirant deodorant that I am able to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>it has a nice smell very subtle and it works great keeps me dry during intense boxing workouts and runs</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;original spice scent&amp;#34;, this is not the same scent that Tussy used to have (and I loved) - I&#x27;m not wild about the scent of this Tussy deodorant.</li>
      <li>i highly suggest it!</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>who&#x27;s only vice was loving too strong and putting himself and his health last, working too hard and embracing the responsibilities of Husband, Father &amp; Son to another level?  </li>
      <li>I first experienced this deodorant when my cousin had brought it to me, one of the main places to get it from was either a Family Dollar or a Walmart and it disappeared off the shelves for a while I was very sad</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive underarms and Tussy</li>
      <li>it works for me like no other deodorant has in the pass.  </li>
      <li>Especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin or react to some of the ingredients in regular deoderants or antiperspirant, I encourage you to try Tussy&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this item for my Son due to his very sensitive skin and the fact that he could not find this product on any shelves, to send several of them was the only option for me?  </li>

    <li> I first experienced this deodorant when my cousin had brought it to me, one of the main places to get it from was either a Family Dollar or a Walmart and it disappeared off the shelves for a while I was very sad but now I just get it off of Amazon it has a nice smell very subtle and it works great keeps me dry during intense boxing workouts and runs</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s advertised as &amp;#34;original spice scent&amp;#34;, this is not the same scent that Tussy used to have (and I loved) - I&#x27;m not wild about the scent of this Tussy deodorant.</li>
    <li> I been using tussy ever since i was 9 yrs. old when I tried other they just don&amp;#34;t hold up like tussy.i am glad I found it on amozon.i am 57 yrs.old now and it&#x27;s still works. I buy it in a12 pack so I want run out.it was 50 cent when I first start using it.I recommend for anyone whose workin out ,it last longer than any other I have tried..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Tussy deodorant since I was a young girl, this is the best deodorant that ever hit the market!  i highly suggest it!</li>
    <li> I have used Tussy in cream form and roll on all my life. For me, it is the most effective antiperspriant on the matket. It is kind to my skin and keeps me fresh all day. My only complaint is that no stores carry it. They seem to go for the fancy, perfumed product instead of quality. Tussy us QUALUTY.</li>
    <li> IT IS A VERY GOOD DEODORANT I HAVE USED IT SINCE I WAS 13 AND I AM NOW 65!!!&lt;br /&gt;GIVE IT A TRY...</li>
    <li> Tussy keeps making, thankfully, a non-scented, simple product that works. I&#x27;ve tried many off the shelf when I couldn&#x27;t find this one &amp; found it irreplaceable.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin or react to some of the ingredients in regular deoderants or antiperspirant, I encourage you to try Tussy&#x27;s.  It is the only one I can use without breaking out.  And, it works.  It is hard to find in stores so I was very happy to find it in this manner.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Works, no chemical smell. Buy it.</li>
    <li> For me, this is the best ever.  I was sad the day I stopped being able to find it in brick-and-mortar stores, but very happy to see it carried on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent very much - subtle spicy clean.&lt;br /&gt;It does unfortunately have aluminum in it, so I only use it for work as needed to reduce any possible health consequences.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my Son due to his very sensitive skin and the fact that he could not find this product on any shelves, to send several of them was the only option for me?  Unfortunately, he never got to use them as he un-expectedly passed away  at age 42 on 6/14/2013 from a  preventable medical emergency, in the worst possible place to have one, at home, asleep and no one with CPR training skills available to come to his aid in the very crucial seconds and minutes, that may have saved his life? The official cause of death has been listed as Cardiomyopathy.  I am devastated in this personal lost, so one of the last things(however small) we shared, is wonderful. Erik C. Allen was a exceptional human being and I am humbled by my role that was assigned to me in producing such a wonderful spirit who courageously faced an early date with death, trying to make life and this world a better place for all that he touched, so much that his mistakes in some very important choices are blessings that validate his right to do so.  He was loved, respected and admired by too many that came to these conclusions, after his exit, which reaffirms for me, that he is in a better place! A true stand up man, who&#x27;s only vice was loving too strong and putting himself and his health last, working too hard and embracing the responsibilities of Husband, Father &amp; Son to another level?  May he RIP, secure in the reality that he was truly a GOOD MAN doing so much for so many, unselfishly right up to the very end!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not fashionable, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perfectly fine deodorant product that does what it is supposed to.  AND NOTHING MORE.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive underarms and Tussy is the only roll-on that I am able to use that has no allergic reaction. I also love the fragrances.</li>
    <li> Have used this product my entire life and now I can&#x27;t find it in the stores.  My Mother also used it her entire life.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant that doesn&#x27;t break me out and it works all day. Would recommend to anyone. Especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use it because it works and the scent reminds me of my mother. Have been using for years now.</li>
    <li> Item was expeditiously delivered in tact. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> GREAT!!! I will use this seller again.</li>
    <li> I always have to buy tussy in bulk on line cuz my husband has used it for years. I thought he was exaggerating, when he ran out, we tried a couple different sticks n roll ons... sure enough, he broke out in a rash n itched like crazy n couldn&#x27;t use anything for several days... now, I order it in advance so he don&#x27;t run out. Glad there is still a trusty go to for him. Wish it was more readily available... on line I will stay I guess! Works well, now I use baby powder scent.</li>
    <li> I have used this produce for years. it works for me like no other deodorant has in the pass.  After it was removed from stores i looked for it on line, and Amazon had it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Tussy is the only antiperspirant deodorant that I am able to use.&lt;br /&gt;The local stores no longer carry the roll-on brand. I was so greatful&lt;br /&gt;to finally be able to purchase this ever-holding deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 33 years, it&#x27;s the only deodorant that can guarantee all day freshness for me.  Taking a big chance on a great friendship, I bought it for a landscaping friend of mine in Fla. She loves it and won&#x27;t use anything but!  Yay Tussy!!!  Shipping was on time and Murphey&#x27;s yard is rockin!!!</li>
