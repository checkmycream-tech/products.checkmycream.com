      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>and I love this wax/paste!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>This product is great for light spiking and styles where my bangs are sculpted upward.</li>
      <li>This Pantene wax works as good or better.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second, this product, unlike a lot of others, has a nice finished feel.  </li>
      <li>Holds hair in place and smells really nice</li>
      <li>I even lent it to a friend and he compared it to the brand he uses and thought this was so much better and has a better hold!</li>
      <li>I was expecting a bit of a stronger hold for &amp;#34;sculpting&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a very light wax.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 3 year olds very fine hair to keep a french braid in and it works great for that!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to see it has returned.</li>
      <li>This one was my favorite.  </li>
      <li>I will be buying this product again. :)</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Make sure your already have an idea in your head about what style you&#x27;re gonna do because it is sticky stuff and will hold your hair</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>But I find I like this formula better.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Probably not something that would work for me (I have thinner hair) but might work better for someone with thicker hair.</li>
      <li>but I found by adding a bit of water to it and rubbing in my palm, that it is easier to apply more evenly</li>
      <li>This of course could be rectified by wetting your hair more with your hands.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product that does exactly what it states.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Not to sticky and easy to put in your hair.</li>
      <li>Gives not to shiny look with good hold good for whole day and most importantly no flakes and hair feel good too.</li>
      <li>Not too sticky or too strong of fragrance.</li>
      <li>Dry your hair vigorously and apply right away for a perfect, moldable, not greasy hold every time.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It was cheap, so I don&#x27;t mind trying it, but I would not order again.</li>
      <li>Light hold.</li>
      <li>It has great malleability for forming my male hair as I want it.</li>
      <li>It gives my straight short hair just the perfect amount of texture.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting much at first, but it sculpted and held better than gel.</li>
      <li>Not too excited about this hair &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff so much...</li>
      <li>This product is okay, but it&#x27;s not as good as the previously made product that was orange in color.  </li>
      <li>In short: it&#x27;s very good on short hair, with good hold, and more of a dry finish.</li>
      <li>I have used many, many different brands of hair wax or hair paste.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>I bought this product to give my little boy a bit of a spike and it worked great.</li>
      <li>It was gentle and just lightly scented.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and seems to work as intended outside of that.</li>
      <li>Probably for short hair would be fine, but not for fine, longer hair.  </li>
      <li>Great wax but to small</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for a great Loreal wax from years ago and have failed thus far, this Pantene product works nearly as good.</li>
      <li>works as good as some of the higher priced competitor products for a quarter of the price or less</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not my personal favorite, so I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.  </li>
      <li>I found for holding my hair in place even a hot climate where i sweat lots in my head.</li>
      <li>This was discontined several years ago, glad to see it back, its my favorite.</li>
      <li>Holds and is re-doable later in the day without more product</li>
      <li>use this on  my short hair and love it</li>
      <li>It has a good amount of hold without feeling unnatural or stiff.  </li>
      <li>Works just a good as the more expensive hair waxes / pomades for men.  </li>
      <li>I used a bit too much of it the first time</li>
      <li>I have very thin, fine, short hair, and this product is perfect...</li>
      <li>It finishes with more of a dry look, but too much can produce a bitch of a crunchy texture.</li>
      <li>I have quite fine hair, and I wear it short.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone with fine short hair.</li>
      <li>but it made my hair feel very greasy.</li>
      <li>The product is very sticky</li>
      <li>I really like this as edge control.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product The product container is deceiving as the actual amount of product is equivalent to approximately 1/3 of the container size. Given this, I gave the product 4 stars. It smells nice and seems to work as intended outside of that. I probably will buy something else next time.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, fine, short hair, and this product is perfect...it&#x27;s lightweight but still sculpts perfectly, and smells great, too. Seems like they no longer make it, since I can&#x27;t find it in stores--stocking up on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Best product for the price.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years.. It does the job of keeping my spiked short haircut spiked all day long.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but it&#x27;s not as good as the previously made product that was orange in color.  It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture and viscosity of this wax.  The only reason that I gave it four instead of five stars is that I notice a slightly chemical scent to it.  It&#x27;s not overbearing, but it&#x27;s there. I think pantene was attempting a neutral smell so that both men and women can use it.  I&#x27;d rather have it be unscented. That being said, I probably will buy this again, because the scent is faint.</li>
    <li> My 16yo son loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great wax but to small</li>
    <li> This sculpting wax is just enough to give my hair a lift.  Not to sticky and easy to put in your hair. I usually follow up with a little hair spray.</li>
    <li> I have short hair. I used this product one time and it Weighs my hair down and  is too heavy and sticky. I would not recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good. Has a decent hold. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Not for me...I was looking for a replacement to Garnier Fructis Shine Wax (which has been discontinued). This product is not what I was looking for, so I can&#x27;t give it a fair review. I have ethnic hair and it made my hair frizz up, which is just the opposite of what I need. The texture is creamy and it&#x27;s white, not clear...hope that helps someone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used it this mornng and it works really well, it calmed all those little hairs that come out and give me a witchy look, you should apply to dry hair and that makes it even better because I can apply it right before leaving to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very low cost for hair wax. Worth every penny I spent.</li>
    <li> Bought for $1.95 through subscribe and save and $2 off coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my favorite hair wax, but for the price, it&#x27;s great for the days I want to do my hair, but don&#x27;t care on using the good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have not found any comparable product.</li>
    <li> It does works as advertised.  I don&#x27;t you it often but I have it when needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to give my little boy a bit of a spike and it worked great. I found out that if you use less it works better. I used a bit too much of it the first time and it was a sticky mess. It was gentle and just lightly scented. I can&#x27;t really say how long it held up because he kept putting a hat on. I will keep using it and I hope that it goes on sale again soon.</li>
    <li> LIKE OTHER PRODUCTS BETTER</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 3 year olds very fine hair to keep a french braid in and it works great for that!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It takes very little and it does not weigh my hair down. It gives my straight short hair just the perfect amount of texture. Would recommend this to anyone with fine short hair.</li>
    <li> does the job, it was intented for at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> use this on  my short hair and love it</li>
    <li> Holds hair in place and smells really nice but it made my hair feel very greasy. Probably not something that would work for me (I have thinner hair) but might work better for someone with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> Light hold. Smells good</li>
    <li> Is a very good product. The prices are reasonable.</li>
    <li> I ordered the sculpting wax as I use product in my hair on a daily basis. This is a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my gripe with this is that the hold is not very good. I have short hair and this states that it is for short hair but it barely holds any shape at all. I was hoping it would be a little firmer. I like product that holds but has a matte finish, and this does not quite live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was cheap, so I don&#x27;t mind trying it, but I would not order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I like how this is different than gel.  When I use gel with my short hair, I often have to refresh it with some water when I go out.  With this wax, the shine and hold last all day!  A little goes a long way compare to gel.  Good Stuff!</li>
    <li> Hmmm.  Not too excited about this hair &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34;.  I bought on a whim due to an Amazon coupon that brought the price way down.  I prefer waxes and pomades vs this Elmer&#x27;s-style fixative.  Of course YMMV; I&#x27;m male with a short clipper cut, hipsteresque hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used sculpting wax or paste before, but this was a disappointment.  It didn&#x27;t hold any type of shape, and was sticky and hard to use.  I have a long bob and was hoping it would help keep things in place, but all it did was take any curl out of the hair and make it frizzy and straight. Probably for short hair would be fine, but not for fine, longer hair.  Disappointing, but at least it wasn&#x27;t very expensive with the coupon. Will try another brand....</li>
    <li> Thought I needed a haircut until I used this stuff. Make sure your hair is slightly damp before applying - gets thick/sticky if not.</li>
    <li> I use this for my son&#x27;s thick hair.  He likes the &amp;#34;fro-hawk&amp;#34; look, but mouse is never enough to keep his look all day.  We tried this stuff, and it held the style all day.</li>
    <li> Works just a good as the more expensive hair waxes / pomades for men.  I have this hair and this works really great.  Make sure your hair is slightly wet or it will feel - and look - like you&#x27;ve applied glue on your hair.  This of course could be rectified by wetting your hair more with your hands.  Great price from a trusted hair care product maker.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Not too fragrant to be noticed you have it on.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a bit of a stronger hold for &amp;#34;sculpting&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s a very light wax. It&#x27;s gooey and provides good separation but no hold to speak of. Your hair will keep it&#x27;s relative shape but not retain any spiking/forming.</li>
    <li> I really like this as edge control. It lasts way longer than any other brand that I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m black and have a wavy/curly natural hair texture. This really holds your hair into place, without the hard, super greasy look. You only need alittle bit of this stuff and a toothbrush to get your edges in place. I will be buying this product again. :)</li>
    <li> One of the best hair wax out there. Not too sticky or too strong of fragrance.</li>
    <li> After Pantene discontinued the other sculpting wax I was using, I gave this one a try based on other reviews. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. The wax is creamy and applies evenly. The hold is not overly stiff, which I like. If you are searching for a replacement to Pantene&#x27;s orange stuff, give this one a try! Pantene please don&#x27;t discontinue this one too!</li>
    <li> I was hooked on the Pantene &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; sculpting wax. But lately it is very hard to locate and very expensive when I do find it. Those of you out there who have used the orange goo know what I am talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was not completely sure this product would be my new go to. But I find I like this formula better. It is not as stiff as the old product .  and does not build up. I find the hold is slightly less than the old orange goo but it is not a problem as I have short naturally curly hair that cannot take a heavy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ladies and gents- if you are like me and do not want to pay $20 plus dollars for a small container of the old orange stuff- I recommend you try this item. Pantene has been forgiven for changing the formula.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair very short on the sides, and very trim on the top, think military regs.  This product does well to keep my hair down and from frizzing.  It adds a slight shine, not liquidy the way a gel might.  If you&#x27;re a guy in the military or on the force, or just wear that look, this product is worth some consideration.</li>
    <li> I have used many, many different brands of hair wax or hair paste.  The one I liked was just getting ridiculous in it&#x27;s price.  I think it was getting up there to around $20 (or close to it).  I just refuse to pay that much for a little dab of hair &amp;#34;glue.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a waste of money.  I decided I&#x27;d try a few different products that I found at Walmart for less than $4.00.  This one was my favorite.  It works great.  Just as well as the $20 one.  So I finally ran out of it and went back to Walmart to get another jar of it.  Alas, they don&#x27;t seem to have it anymore!  Just my luck.  I&#x27;ll go look at some of the other Walmarts though just in case they might have it.  At least I know I can find it on amazon if need be.  But I won&#x27;t pay for shipping on such an inexpensive product so I&#x27;ll have to save it until I&#x27;m buying some other stuff too.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells good and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel sticky.</li>
    <li> This is too sticky to be described as a wax.</li>
    <li> I began using this product in 2007-2008. It was orange, very affordable, and soon after was discontinued. I&#x27;m glad to see it has returned. Gone is the orange color, but firmly in place are both the ingredients and low price. My hair is thick, somewhat dense, and I usually keep it short. This product is great for light spiking and styles where my bangs are sculpted upward. It finishes with more of a dry look, but too much can produce a bitch of a crunchy texture. Fixing hair later in the day doesn&#x27;t produce any noticeable white flakes or particles, at least not if I use the recommend amount or less. In short: it&#x27;s very good on short hair, with good hold, and more of a dry finish. Don&#x27;t overuse.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair and I love this wax/paste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product from stores for a few years, but recently found on Amazon and of course, the price is better here and I don&#x27;t have to leave my house -- a win/win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy/curly hair.  It&#x27;s cut short and styled into a female faux-hawk.  I&#x27;ve tried several different products to shape and hold my faux-hawk, and this one works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I like that a little bit goes a long way.  The container is deceptive and I was disappointed the first time I purchased, because you realize not the entire container is full.  I was less disappointed once I realized that it really does not take much to make this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this product, unlike a lot of others, has a nice finished feel.  Some waxes are too sticky for my liking, while others leave my hair feeling hard or crunchy when dried.  This product does neither.  I use a dime or so sized dollop, rub between my fingers, and then shape through my towel-dried hair, and then blow-dry.  It has a good amount of hold without feeling unnatural or stiff.  You can run your fingers through it and it feels just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used on dried hair, it has the potential to get a little stiff, but I only use it that way to sometimes get a touch-up, or if I have a particularly bad fly-away or sprout of hair going in the wrong direction--usually in those cases, I need a little more hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work for thin hair, or hair with little body, but for thicker hair you&#x27;re looking to get volume and hold for, this stuff is excellent.</li>
    <li> DANDRUFF DANGER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately apparent to me was the consequence of dandruff after I began using this crap. I have used it a few times since I purchased to verify that it was this substance and not changes in the weather. It caused my entire head to break out in such a dramatic way, I will never use another Pantene product. They gave me a refund.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair wax I&#x27;ve ever found.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and will be a lifelong customer.  They discontinued this product a couple years ago and I was really distraught.  This is the exact same as the old orange wax that they previously sold.  I&#x27;m not a big &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; guy, so this product fits me perfectly.  Dry your hair vigorously and apply right away for a perfect, moldable, not greasy hold every time.  Very simple.  I don&#x27;t use any other hair products beside this wax.  A++</li>
    <li> Excellent product that has great hold. I even lent it to a friend and he compared it to the brand he uses and thought this was so much better and has a better hold!</li>
    <li> This was discontinued years ago (I had to buy it on ebay for some ridiculous price) and then brought back this year.  It is very hard to find this in stores.  I have tried multiple products (including some very expensive) to obtain texture and hold and this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> Excellent hold, smells good. Make sure your already have an idea in your head about what style you&#x27;re gonna do because it is sticky stuff and will hold your hair however it is when it comes in contact with your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much... I&#x27;ve begun hoarding it.  It&#x27;s great for a mid-30&#x27;s guy with thinning hair. It gives hair a little more volume and doesn&#x27;t feel gucky.  It appears to be the same product sold under the Old Spice label as &amp;#34;Ricochet Fiber&amp;#34;, but for half the price.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this wax... I was using American crew from long time and I was seeing lot of flaking and my hair been dry so I started finding a wax and I bought this , Nivea and Got2 B glue orange flavor wax and this performed really good. Gives not to shiny look with good hold good for whole day and most importantly no flakes and hair feel good too.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price I got this for.  My husband loves it.  Win win for everyone!</li>
    <li> I got this as it was a good deal on the subscribe and save with coupon. But it turned into a buyer beware. My maid of honor had a pantene sculpting wax she used in my hair at my wedding a few years ago and it worked well. But this newer formula has left my naturally curly  hair sticky, oily, stiff ,hard and lifeless . Half way through my work day all I want to do is go home and take a shower to try and get it out. Will be throwing this away. There goes  $2.24 down the drain but at least I didn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
    <li> I didnt like how it stuck to the hair no matter how much I combed through it. 1st, I tried on my frizz, it matted my hair together, then I tried on my sons head to make spikes on one and flatten a cow lick on the other, it did the same thing. Wax is the best name for this because that is how it goes on and nothing I did would keep it from matting the hair together</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product for spiking his shorter hair.  Looks great too!</li>
    <li> This sculpting wax is the perfect styling tool for today&#x27;s hairstyles.  You get firm hold and control without any stiffness or crispness. Your hair is not left all greasy or coated, and the style stays fixed all day.  I have a super short pixie cut and like to mess it up a little, so this wax is perfect.  you can also use it to create pointy bangs and great texture and separation.  I have found few products at this price that do the same thing.  Usually I have to pay double or triple the price for some expensive salon brand. This Pantene wax works as good or better.  Love it!  Oh...and my son steals it from me all the time, so apparently it works fab on men&#x27;s cuts as well.</li>
    <li> Not the best but does the job.</li>
    <li> I have very course, thick hair and I usually use \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Texture Fiber\\&quot; to get the piecey look and it works very well.  But it&#x27;s expensive.  I saw this as an add on item and figured I&#x27;d see if it would work as a replacement and...meh...    Compared to \\&quot;10\\&quot; the product is very thin and doesn&#x27;t provide near as much hold.  I think people with finer hair may be happier with it.    So...lesson learned, again.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Received 2. One was fine, the other was dried out?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the issues with shopping online. Might of been old?</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much at first, but it sculpted and held better than gel. It also lasted longer without the flakes.</li>
    <li> I have short, VERY straight, baby-fine, STUBBORN hair and, until now, have found nothing (short of a permanent) that would keep a curl for any more than a couple of hours. Now I apply mousse before I blow-dry my hair, use a curling iron to curl it, let my hair cool totally and then rub a TINY dab of this product between my hands and apply it to my hair and style it. I need some hairspray to help it out a bit. The other day I had to dash out to the car in the rain. When I checked the mirror, my hair was STILL curled!!!</li>
    <li> works as good as some of the higher priced competitor products for a quarter of the price or less</li>
    <li> Works great, smells great!</li>
    <li> This product holds hair in place all day long without being greasy or wet.</li>
    <li> same maker and same consistency of the Aussie product, at a better price.. win-win</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need hair spray when you use this.</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells great and works great like a molding clay, but not as sticky as gel.</li>
    <li> This good product. I have quite fine hair, and I wear it short. I found for holding my hair in place even a hot climate where i sweat lots in my head. Other wax or gels have not kept my hair in tact like this one does.</li>
    <li> Best hair stuff I can find that doesn&#x27;t require taking a mortgage out.  I have 3 sons who use it as well, so we go though a lot of it.</li>
    <li> This was discontined several years ago, glad to see it back, its my favorite. Holds and is re-doable later in the day without more product</li>
    <li> I have used Pantene gel before, I expect the styling wax would be like mud, but it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair much...  Watch the volume.  It&#x27;s a small jar for the price.</li>
    <li> My new favorite hair product. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for a great Loreal wax from years ago and have failed thus far, this Pantene product works nearly as good. It has great malleability for forming my male hair as I want it. It has great hold despite the &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; rating, it holds harder than similar old spice, suave, and axe products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product that does exactly what it states.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not my personal favorite, so I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.  However, it is a good quality product and has a wonderful fragrance.</li>
    <li> I  use the product on my short/medium hair to give it some definition. The product is very sticky but I found by adding a bit of water to it and rubbing in my palm, that it is easier to apply more evenly and I get the results I was hoping for instead of paying 3 times as much for other styling waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE Yes, I would recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> Works well in my hair. Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just ok, makes hair a looking little crunchy/stringy&lt;br /&gt;the volume doesn&#x27;t seem to hold very long&lt;br /&gt;but it does give some good texture and it smells nice&lt;br /&gt;more of a gel/glue rather than a wax</li>
