      <li>Love these!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Looked nice but caused severe itching</li>
      <li>The brush has a tapered end that gets my inside corners nicely.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on nicely without clumping and stays put throughout the day without flaking.  </li>
      <li>The formula is also of a nice consistency, hasn&#x27;t flaked or clumped on me yet.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great deal!</li>
      <li>For me this thickens my lashes nicely, but doesn&#x27;t lengthen them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The reason I like this mascara is that it comes off very easily with shea butter hand soap.  </li>
      <li>I love Clinique, always works and stays on.</li>

      <li>I am a big fan of this mascara; it does not smudge, goes on smoothly without clumping and washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>Three small tubes better than one large, reduces drying,  seems more economical.</li>
      <li>It arrived on time - although a huge (nearly 10x</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I received it as a gift and will definitely repurchase.</li>
      <li>i love this mascara, so obviously for this price, it was a steal.</li>
      <li>I feel confident it cuts down on free floating debre.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only comparable  cheap alternative is maybelline&#x27;s Full N&#x27; Soft, and clinique is still easier in the skin around the eyes</li>
      <li>This is a reasonable every day mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>very affordable I will be purchasing again</li>

      <li>I love this stuff, it keeps my eyelashes firmly in place, and still has a soft feel!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and wow!</li>
      <li>It is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m have sensitive skin and eyes</li>
      <li>size) box was used to deliver, which wasn&#x27;t necessary, as I&#x27;d have been fine with a little bag.  </li>
      <li>I can say nothing of how long a tube lasts - but I can say that it stays on even through 4 hours straight of dancing.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara, no clumps, not a stringy mess like other brands I have tried.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this because of the great reviews, but I have to say I am very disappointed.</li>
      <li>prefer a more dramatic mascara.</li>
      <li>As someone with naturally dark eyelashes, all I really needed to do was lengthen.</li>

    <li> I was excited to try this because of the great reviews, but I have to say I am very disappointed. This mascara is nothing great at all. I would say my cheaper drugstore Maybelline is way better!</li>
    <li> i love this mascara, so obviously for this price, it was a steal. but it was very cold when it arrived due to the cold weather, and when i opened one, it looked like it was dried out.hopefully after it warms up, it will be what i expected.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I have tried!  I don&#x27;t feel the need to curl my lashes.  It gives it length without the clump.  I have had this for a month now and still no clumps on brush or lashes!</li>
    <li> It runs completely down your face should you tear up for any reason!  The worst clinique mascar I&#x27;ve evr used!</li>
    <li> I can say nothing of how long a tube lasts - but I can say that it stays on even through 4 hours straight of dancing. Last homecoming it didn&#x27;t streak during use. It wipes off easily with a wet papertowel/washcloth/hand. As someone with naturally dark eyelashes, all I really needed to do was lengthen. This did the job. It arrived on time - although a huge (nearly 10x it&#x27;s size) box was used to deliver, which wasn&#x27;t necessary, as I&#x27;d have been fine with a little bag.  My picture (forgive me for my overall appearance) is of one eye with masscara and one without.</li>
    <li> Excellent Clinique product!</li>
    <li> Was Ok. I&#x27;m not sure if it was current. It seemed to clump on using.</li>
    <li> For me this thickens my lashes nicely, but doesn&#x27;t lengthen them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are dark at the base and a reasonable length, but the tips are blonde.  I prefer my mascara to darken and lengthen a bit.  This is a reasonable every day mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nicely without clumping and stays put throughout the day without flaking.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a more dramatic mascara.</li>
    <li> Fabulous This product is one I have been using for a long time. The price was great.</li>

    <li> Love these!  Three small tubes better than one large, reduces drying,  seems more economical.</li>
    <li> I have used this for almost a year. I love it! Makes my lashes so long!</li>
    <li> Thanks for the great deal! This is my favorite mascara, won&#x27;t use any other!</li>

    <li> I have been purchasing this mascara for years. I have naturally long lashes, but need mascara. Whenever I wear this brand I always get more compliments on my lashes and people ask me what I wear. I will continue to buy and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Good product... Easy to use. I feel confident it cuts down on free floating debre. I would buy again.  Thx</li>
    <li> Product is all dried up.. I should of paid more attention to other reviews.</li>
    <li> Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara! and lasts forever</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, no clumps, not a stringy mess like other brands I have tried. This size is also convenient, a great product to travel with or to stick down in your purse for a quick touch up on the go!</li>

    <li> This is the it make my eyelashes grow!!.. I&#x27;m have sensitive skin and eyes and I never have a problem with any Clinique products...</li>
    <li> Always use this brand.</li>
    <li> Stuff works but this type burns my eyes. Prefer the black tubes by Clinique instead</li>
    <li> Crumbles, applies thick and thin</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! This lengthens, gives volume and gives very dark lashes! My favorite thing about this mascara though is the wand! Perfection... not to skinny, not to wide, never smudges or flakes, and bristles are the perfect length and spaceing. I have tons of mascaras but this is the one that I always grab for to do my top and bottom lashes!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery but the mascara was emptier than expect. Almost like there was only enough product for two uses.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara!</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t stay well. My eyelashes won&#x27;t stayed curled when I use it either.</li>
    <li> Not the same quality as the ones in the Clinique gift.  They probably are left overs - don&#x27;t last as long  - seem dry.</li>
    <li> I love Clinique, always works and stays on.</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara and picks up every lash!</li>
    <li> very affordable I will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> Love them.  It makes my lashed look longer naturaly</li>
    <li> Got this as a free sample along with a purchased mascara and wow! It lengthens my lashes immensely. My lashes are tiny after years of wearing lash extensions so I was looking for a lengthening mascara. This one delivers. I&#x27;m so glad I received it as a gift and will definitely repurchase. The brush has a tapered end that gets my inside corners nicely. The formula is also of a nice consistency, hasn&#x27;t flaked or clumped on me yet.</li>
    <li> An excellent  buy. One tube lasted me a year.</li>
    <li> Looked nice but caused severe itching</li>
