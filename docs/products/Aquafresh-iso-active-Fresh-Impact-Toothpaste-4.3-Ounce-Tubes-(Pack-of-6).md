<li> Small trade-off</li>
<li> Suddenly it is hard to find.  </li>
<li> It is a little expensive ... because the formula requires an expensive container with a pressurized pouch (like shaving GEL).</li>

<li> Unable to find it in stores now.</li>
<li> I was unable to find it anywhere else.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t flossed (bad bad bad) in 2 months, haven&#x27;t used high-alcohol content</li>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s basically shaving cream. You put it on your toothbrush and it&#x27;s a gel, then you start brushing and it turns into a thick foam and TASTES and FEELS exactly like shaving cream. I almost threw up while brushing my teeth with it, it felt wrong, it IS wrong. I checked the ingredients.......it contains soap. No wonder it foams. I cannot believe they put this toothpaste on the market. My mouth does not feel clean, it feels violated.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, quick delivery</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this toothpaste.  I used to get gingivitus alllll the time ... constantly flossing and using high alcohol content (bad for you) mouth wash, especially around this one crown.  With THIS product ..... I haven&#x27;t flossed (bad bad bad) in 2 months, haven&#x27;t used high-alcohol content mouth wash in 4 months ..... and NOOOOOOOO gingivitus.    The comments on here are so pathetic.  It is a little expensive ... because the formula requires an expensive container with a pressurized pouch (like shaving GEL). It foams a lot .... it is supposeddddd to).  But only requires a tiny amount of toothpaste.  The dispenser works perfectly, people.    STOCK UP ON THIS PRODUCT.  IT WON&#x27;T WON&#x27;T BE ON THE MARKET LONG.</li>
    <li> I also can&#x27;t say enough good things about this toothpaste.  It has a clean, crisp taste of pure mint and more importantly, it leaves your mouth feeling fresher than a spring morning after a rainstorm.  The foaming action takes getting used to, but the feeling of clean teeth you get as a result of this is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I tried this toothpaste when it first came out, and I&#x27;ve never looked back.  About 6 months ago I inadvertently ordered six \\&quot;tubes\\&quot;.  I used it once, and gave it away.  Yes, the dribbling out of the spout is annoying, but everything else about it is great.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  I love the foaming action.</li>
    <li> This has made a substantial difference with my gums.  I have always have had borderline issues with my gums and in the three months that I have been using the Aquafresh ISO toothpaste, my gums have improved. My last check up with my dentist confirmed it.  What more can I say?  It&#x27;s a fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Since I had a $2 coupon for this toothpaste, I gave it a try.  That coupon was the only thing I can say that was positive about it.  The taste is very medicinal and does not leave that fresh, just brushed after effect that lasts and lasts. After each use, additional toothpaste runs out of the nozzle, down the bottle, and into the cap.  It then foams up making quite a mess.  I&#x27;d estimate that I&#x27;ve wasted about a quarter of what I have used.  I&#x27;m going back to good old tubed toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, will continue to buy as long as available, I can no longer buy it in the stores, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Possibly the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. It gives you a dentist-clean feeling every time. As you brush, Fresh Impact foams and saturates your mouth. The experience is pleasant and really feels like its working. You&#x27;re left clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the pump is a little hard to work. You really have to jam it down, which causes a bunch to shoot out at once. And a little bit always ends up dripping out after you&#x27;ve re-capped it, which makes the can forever messy. Small trade-off I suppose for the excellent quality of the toothpaste itself.</li>

    <li> I love it! I have used this toothpaste for years. Unable to find it in stores now.</li>
    <li> Merchandise arrived as scheduled.</li>
    <li> this was a scam. I ordered 6 and all were within a month of expiration. waste money</li>
    <li> Our favorite toothpaste but next to impossible to find in stores. It seems when we find a product we really like the stores or manufacturer doesn&#x27;t have the same opinion.</li>

    <li> My favorite toothpaste.  My mouth feels extra clean after I use it.  I also like the fact that it is a gel.</li>
    <li> I like this product and have better dental checkup&#x27;s using it.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again....I really do like it.</li>
    <li> It is just what I wanted. I was unable to find it anywhere else.</li>
