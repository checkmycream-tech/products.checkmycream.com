      <li>This is kind of deceiving customers.</li>

      <li>I would have no problem if this product worked, no matter what kind of sales tactic they use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Although this cream is easily absorbed and feels nice on my skin I can&#x27;t honestly say that it has made any visible improvement to my skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. I like it but will not purchase it again as it is not worth the price. I&#x27;m 54 so I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles but it really hasn&#x27;t done any of the things that it claims to do. At least not for me.</li>
    <li> this company should be closed  down ,they are criminals .&lt;br /&gt;i tried this cream ,it is not life cell for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it makes you look younger but you can also pass away sooner.&lt;br /&gt;they are from florida ,i have reported them to the goverment.&lt;br /&gt;thea s schlosser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i worket with wolfram w kuehau m. d. for 12 years ,he is the co pioneer of life cells .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a scam.</li>
    <li> I tried the &#x27;free&#x27; sample of Lifecell Anti Ageing, paying only the shipping cost. I found it a pleasant cream to use but it made no difference to my skin at all and then, I was checking my Visa card and saw a charge for $206 which I had not authorised at all. Lifecell had just taken it out of my account withour any warning they were going to do so, so after an emai to them I have returned the tube and I am waiting for a refund of my money.&lt;br /&gt;By charging for post it is a very sneaky way having your card number to be able to put the charge through and I find a lot of companies are doing it, so the answer is to not try a FREE sample.  Margaret</li>
    <li> This company (Lifecell skin care products) should not be allowed to do business because of the way they use deceptive advertising to sell an inferior product.  Not only did this product not help my skin, it actually made it feel worse.  Beware of their fancy advertising claims and their promises of a free trial that will end up costing you $189 and endless hours of trying to get your name off their lists!! I have reported them to the Better Business Bureau!! Be smart and purchase skin care products from other far more reputable companies that offer wonderful products.  There are many out there!!!</li>
    <li> Luckily I received Lifecell to try for 30 days with a money back guarantee promotion.  Thank goodness as its going back in the mail today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Lifecell twice a day for 3 weeks and have not seen any difference in the lines on my face.  In addition to reducing wrinkles, the product claims that it has light reflecting properties to make the wrinkle appear \\&quot;almost invisible\\&quot; - again I did not see any difference what so ever at any time after applying the product twice a day for 3 weeks.  The cream made my face feel dry and I never felt a tingling sensation.  I know I have another week before the product must be returned - but quite honestly it did nothing for me and I want to make sure I get my money back!</li>
    <li> I Am a 42 year old woman and have literally tried hundreds of creams, I have to honestly say that Lifecell is by far the absolute worst thing I have ever put on my face...It left my face feeling dry, and just felt like it sat on the top layer of my skin.  I put it on just like instructed and used it faithfully (against my better judgement) for 60 days!  I have returned the product for my $$ back and am extremely disappointed, I really had high hopes for this product!!  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY, JUNK, JUNK, JUNK...If you like the feel of putty on your skin then by all means put it on!</li>
    <li> I have no problem with looking young because people would mistakenly think I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s when I&#x27;m actually almost 40. But my problem had been my puffy eyes. Clinique have always been my be-all end all products since high school but it did not work for my eyes. I searched, tried and wasted everything to find that elusive eye cream. I started from the cheapest then to the more expensive. Then 4 years ago, I had to think a dozen times over Life cell wrinkle cream...yes, they did have a 30-day free trial but what if it was a scam like this teeth whitening scam I got sucked into and I got charged every month for a product I didn;t even use but once? I dawdled...Too many celebrities plugging...it reminded me of cable tv ads...But  I had to try it. BAM! It was the only thing that worked for me! Well, if there were others, they must be more expensive. I only used it for my surrounding eye area so a tube lasts me for more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;My face is still Clinique dependent and I don&#x27;t smoke or drink and I maintain a good body so I can&#x27;t say if it worked for the rest of the skin but it just does fine for my eyes!</li>
    <li> I used this product as directed everyday until gone.  I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic results - my skin looked the same as when I used my regular creams.  For the price, it is not worth it, I know a dozen products around $25 to $60 that offer the same or better results.  Try Avon Anew products and their deep crease serum or Mannatech products or Oil of Olay creams.</li>
    <li> I am in the beginning of 30s, and started to notice all the wrinkles and experimented with different stuff... then I came across the advertisement of &#x27;lifecell&#x27;, and purchased one. It does not worth the money, I don&#x27;t see what they claim, and after 2 months of using this product only since it claims to be the all in one skin care, I started to notice my wrinkles on the forehead is starting to come back/ getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;The surface of my skin seems to stay smooth, but other than that I really don&#x27;t see what this product is doing for the money I paid for. I am discontinuing the use of lifecell and go back to my usual combination of creams and serums. When it sounds too good to be true, you know what.&lt;br /&gt;When you purchase the first box, it will automatically sign you up for the automatic future shipment, so make sure you pay attention to it. Also, if you want to return for money back as they claim, you need to keep the box!!! I wish I did.</li>
    <li> I know the price is exorbitant, but sometimes I can find it for about $30 cheaper.  Either way, it&#x27;s worth it for me.  This is the absolutely only antiaging cream that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  It actually has helped heal the acne I had gotten from other products. I use it with my derma roller, and my skin is smooth, firm, and even toned. My skin also doesn&#x27;t dry out in the winter, like it used to, except maybe around the eyes. I&#x27;m just waiting for the price do go down.  Is just has to, eventually...doesn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> I bought this product through their \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; offer (not to be confused with free sample!). They send you the product and if you don&#x27;t send it back (IN THE BOX, SO DON&#x27;T THROW IT AWAY) within 30 days, they will charge you $189. Unlike some other people on this board and others who complain of not being able to reach anyone or leaving messages that were never returned, I was able to reach someone using the phone number they provided. She gave me instructions on how to return it. I am returning it because after using it for 3 weeks I can see that the product&#x27;s efficacy is pretty much zero to MINIMAL -- certainly no better than some of the OTC products I&#x27;ve been using for $30. In my book, $189 is way too much to pay for 2.54 oz of something that really doesn&#x27;t work all that well. As a side point, the product brags about being \\&quot;supermoisturizing\\&quot; but actually, my facial skin felt slightly \\&quot;tight\\&quot; after using it, as though I needed some extra moisture (I do have dry skin and have had all my life). The smell is also kind of weird, vaguely ocean-like. If you&#x27;ve ever been to the Dead Sea, it&#x27;s sort of like that. (Maybe they make it from Dead Sea minerals like Ahava does, which actually has great products.) Considering all the complaints I&#x27;ve read about the smell and my own experience with this product&#x27;s olfactory characteristics, South Beach might want to consider putting some fragrance in the product.</li>
    <li> From using this, and from reading the reviews, I&#x27;ve concluded that, like many things, it simply works well for some people, doesn&#x27;t work well for others.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, so this is a limited report, but I can say that it works miracles (on me anyway) as far as getting rid of puffiness, \\&quot;bags\\&quot; under my eyes - virtually totally erases them within just a few minutes of application.  I&#x27;ve also seen some slight improvement in my overall skin color (reducing age spots, redness, etc.).  Excellent as a moisturizer.  Wrinkles:  reduces, but no miraculous vanishing comparable to what it does for bags under the eyes - most effective on the large wrinkles across my neck.  Have not noticed tightening or \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; along my jaw line (but again, I&#x27;ve been using it less than 4 weeks).  Hard to get away from the fact that this product, no matter how good it is, is way overpriced - so much so that I was kind of hoping that it WOULDN&#x27;T work at all, so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to consider spending that much money.  I still haven&#x27;t made up my mind whether I&#x27;ll continue with it.  If it was about half the cost, I&#x27;d definitely continue with it to see how it does over a 2-3 month period, but it&#x27;s really hard to justify spending that much money when you can find comparable quality formulas for much, much less.  (Also, claims to be \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s not since they specifically tell you it&#x27;s NOT for use over your eyes (upper eyelids).</li>
    <li> I came across life cell quite by accident on the web and was impressed by all the media info which now as I look at it is probably just pictures from a free giveaway at a gala Hollywood event. Nevertheless, I figured wow, if the claims are true, I don&#x27;t mind trying it free for 30 days. I thought I was getting a 30 day supply for free. That&#x27;s what they make you think. I guess somehow I missed all the fine print in my rush to try this product. But about 45 days I received another box of the cream. I called right away and said I did not order this. Much to my surprise, they charged me $149 for this shipment, plus $189 for the first shipment which was not free at all. I just called my bank right away and they got on the phone with LifeCell with me and we agreed I&#x27;d ship both back and be credited in full (less S&amp;H). I found the fine print and read through it and it says you can return it up to 120 days after purchase if you&#x27;re not happy with it. I never finished the first bottle. Did not see any noticeable differences in comparison to any other cream I used. But I did not use it for 30 days so I gave them a two. I don&#x27;t like being tricked into orders so I can&#x27;t do business with them. If you send the package back make sure you do UPS with Tracking No. My return shipment arrived back to them today. Let&#x27;s see if they refund without further calls. Also there is a procedure you must follow. You  have to write your invoice no. name, address and phone and include it in the package. I taped it to the product so there is no separation. My overall opinion of the product....mostly hype.</li>
    <li> I got the free trial on the website and it promised its safe for acne prone skin (like mine) so I believed them. I used for a week and a half and I did see results BUT I started breaking out. Not just normal acne, but cystic acne. I had huge lumps on my face that I had to go get cut open by a dermatologist. Horrible exp. I do still use it on my eyes and I do like those results. If you dont get acne however, you really will love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Complete disaster. I used it for 4 days and my face started getting dry and red and lines seem to magnify. the stuff about lines not being visible to the human eye with this cream is total sales pitch. It smells like a skunk when you put it on and drys your skin very bad. It is supposed to be a super moisturizer but I think it does the complete opposite. I had to apply vitamin E cream day and night for a week to undo the damage that this stuff does. I have used IS clinical products in the past and they work great. everybody should try the firming complex from them. It works fast and over time really gives you that 20 year old skin everybody is looking for. I have come to think that there is no cure for lines under your eyes and most stuff only masks it. I can&#x27;t even say that for Lifecell. It is a total sales pitch and does nothing but worsen the problems you are trying to remedy.</li>
    <li> You must give LifeCell a credit card number for them to charge shipping and handing for your promised trial. If you order the trial of this product you will receive a full size 2 month supply tube. If you do not return the unused portion of the tube within 30 days of your purchase the company will automatically charge your credit card the full amount for the tube, and will continue the automatic billing every 2 months. You must have your purchase number and fill out the correct form provided on their site to return the tube. They will encourage you to continue to use the product because it takes more than two weeks to see the effects of the cream so they can get the full money for the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product last summer not through Amazon, through their site. I opened the box and saw that the quantity looked more than trial size, I did use it for a few weeks before catching on to the deception, I managed to get my tube back before they started billing my credit card. The Better Business Bureau had given South Beach Skincare/LifeCell an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating. The BBB&#x27;s  South Beach Skincare/LifeCell page currently says,  \\&quot;BBB&#x27;s information on this company is being updated, and no report is available at this time.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t fathom why the BBB would change the rating on this company, the LifeCell website is still deceptive and desperate. Their product must not be very good for them to invest so much in such shady practices. After I returned it I went to CVS and found a product at a much better price that works and feels great, and it&#x27;s honest.</li>
    <li> I do notice that the fine lines do diminsh after application, due to the reflecting light property in life cell.  One aspect I didnt like is there is no spf in it which is the ultimate protection for preventing new wrinkles and fine lines, so I would have to use my regualr moisturizer over lifecell for spv protection.  Also, I had to continue using my usual eye cream for my eyelids, since you cannot use lifecell on eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was hard for me to tell if the product was working so for about a month I put lifecell on half of my face and the other half I used my usual products.  I also was unable to apply lifecell in the evenings, so I may have had stronger results if I could keep it up, but I just cant. I also concentrated on this fine line in my eye area, and said to myself if this goes away, Im sold.  I think the fine line did decrease but I am not sure.  There are also fine lines on my forehead.  I could not tell if the wrinkles on my forehead where I was applying lifecell were smaller than the ones on the other side of my face - I thought they were, but I wasnt sure.  I asked my mom to take a look and she said they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really bought this product for eye puffiness which I dont think it really worked.  However, I do recommend buying Preparation H in Canada - the US one wont work as the formula was changed because people began using as a beauty product.  I was pretty sure I saw a difference in day one from Canada&#x27;s preparartion H.  The eye bag on the left side of my face is practically gone.  My right one is more defined because that is the side of my face I sleep on - another habit I cannot change, but it has improved as well.  I would even go as far to say that it was dramatic improvement and would recommend it - I really dont make many recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a different product for diminishing spots on that seemed to be more effective than lifecell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lifecell may be good for reducing fine lines over time and is a great filler, but I think you can find better eye products for puffiness and blackness and a better product for reducing spots - I used something by Estee Lauder and I thought it worked pretty well, but I have nothing to compare it to other than lifecell.  I started using both products at the same time.better eye products for puffiness and blackness and a better product for reducing spots - I used something by Estee Lauder and I thought it worked pretty well, but I have nothing to compare it to other than lifecell.  I started using both products at the same time.</li>
    <li> I got the free trial so I didn&#x27;t know what the price was because they hide that pretty well. I thought it would probably be $50 or $60.I was excited to get it and immediately tried it, on one side only. I thought it did make the fine lines around my eyes seem less noticeable and my face felt tighter. I did feel the tingling sensation. A definite improvement. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for 2 weeks, on both sides, and noticed my face felt very dry. I didn&#x27;t see any of the promised long term effects. When I found out how much Lifecell costs, I decided to send it back. It&#x27;s a product I would pay less for to use on special occasions for the immediate effects, but it&#x27;s way too expensive for what it does,</li>
    <li> I just ordered my free trial of LifeCell and read reviews after placing the order.  The reviews stating troubles with charges as well as poor results for this expensive product have me scared.  I will certainly write a review after trying the product for 30 days.</li>
    <li> So I asked for a free trail, which I received. The product doesn&#x27;t work and saw no changes after using it for 2 months. This morning I checked my bank account only to see that Life cell was trying to take 149.00 dollars out of my bank account for items I never ordered. When I called and asked why they where charging me this, they said oh you never cancelled your order, so every two months will bill you for another tube. Bunch of BS, that they do this and the tube of cream sure as hell is not worth 149.00 dollars. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Great company to communicate with over email, but not the phone. Their Representative don&#x27;t even introduce the company name and it&#x27;s just confusing because your like who is calling? As well, the Representative was very hasty when I wanted to cancel and her exact words after I said I was no longer interested were, \\&quot; OK, good by then.\\&quot; Ha, this is terrible, but like I said if you talk to this company through email you get a much better professional response. But the Customer service via phone need some more training in customer service, in my eye it was poor taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jennifer</li>
    <li> Very disappointing product. I really couldn&#x27;t see where it did anything for my skin.  It seemed to have a tendency to get a rubbery feel to it as you spread it on your skin especially around the edges of your face. Actually I would have a few litle rubber balls on my fingers when done. Definitely NOT worth the price. I would never invest that kind of money into that product again.</li>
    <li> I have always been a skeptic with advertising, especially when it comes to skin care.  But I fell for the Lifecell Ad and am very disappointed in this product.  I used it for three weeks and am going to quit.  It has turned my skin into a pasty white tone.  As for lines &amp; wrinkles - it doesn&#x27;t do a thing!  I will stick to my Olay products &amp; am done with falling for these \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; advertisements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping that I can return my product - if not I&#x27;m out $189.00.</li>
    <li> Have used each day after receipt; have NOT seen any&lt;br /&gt;reduction in wrinkles; will NOT purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Price is too much without results.</li>
    <li> I used this one time do far and awsome results I am 42, now. The lines around my eyes were all most gone with one application. I cannot wait to see how it works after a week or so.</li>
    <li> I ordered the cream on free trial basis.  It seems to smooth out the wrinkles temporarily.  I have not had it long enough to see the long-term results.  There is a definite feeling of tightening right after application, at least as far as my skin is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you order, you must assume responsibility to inform yourself regarding all aspects of the purchase.  I called to find out about the price and the exact date when the product has to be back in their hands.  I was treated courteously and received all info I needed. I told them the price was too high and the operator checked into a discount for me.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will continue using this product or not, it might not be effective for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you order over the internet, you must read all details and follow up.  Don&#x27;t blame the company. Most of the time, it is the consumer&#x27;s negligence when they get charged.  It has happened to me before.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have bought this expensive product because of its way of making age spots and discolouration disappear.My skin is smoother and I have a more even skin tone.I haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkle reduction but friends do comment on how well I look.</li>
    <li> I actually called this company to make sure they were legitimate, turns out they had a real live person answer the phone and answer all my questions. anyways I got the cream and I have noticed a difference of the wrinkles around my face. I rarely comment on products but this one deserves an excellent review. thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not big on making a bunch of noise about a product, whether good or bad.  If it works for me, then great.  If it turned me three shades of blue, then the makers would get an earful and need to take care of it, but I wouldn&#x27;t waste a lot of time trying to be &#x27;heard&#x27; on a blog somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, because the LifeCell cream is on the spendy side, I think some people may want either some assurances of its effectiveness, or some warnings if it didn&#x27;t deliver.  For me, it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a one-week wonder and instantly make me ready for t.v., but by the time I needed to think about whether to re-order or not, I can definitely say that I am better with it than I was without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and loved it!  It was all that I imagined and more.  I saw results almost immediately after I started using it and now people are always commenting on how good my skin looks.  I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a quality face cream.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product, I was looking desperately for legitimate reviews on this product but couldn&#x27;t find any. I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months and am disappointed, but not surprised, to see little to no results. I have fine lines, not deep-set wrinkles on my face, and they are still not visibly reduced. I think the cream works sort of like Vaseline in that as soon as you apply it, it will dull the fine lines and therefore make them appear less noticeable, but as soon as you wash it off, they are just as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, my skin was softer, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay $189 for softer skin!</li>
    <li> I am 53, and have always taken care of my skin.  Before I wised up to the tactics employed to snare the unwary, I believed some of the \\&quot;reviews\\&quot; of this product I read.  Unfortunately, they are,&lt;br /&gt;as I came to learn too late, just baloney.  I used this product for one year, convinced it would deliver the goods.  My husband, age 64, and with damaged skin from a life outdoors, also used it.  We gave it plenty of time to do its \\&quot;magic\\&quot; but none was forthcoming.  We have switched to the Timeless Secret line of products, which is fine, but the marketing and customer service is awful.  I&#x27;m still looking for the fountain of wrinkle-free youth, but have not found it yet...</li>
    <li> Enthusiastically I have awaited this miracle product, but to date nothing has arrived.  However, the $4.95 I paid for shipping and handling has been deducted from my banking account and the $189.00 that I wasn&#x27;t suppose to pay until I had the product for at least 30 days.  A hold against my debit card that meant I didn&#x27;t have access to my money made it short of theft by deceipt.  Clearly the terms and conditions said it would not occur until after I had the product.  Furious at this maneaauver, I called demanding that the hold be removed. I did get access to my money, but buyer beware if you are dealing directly with South Beach Skin Care.</li>
    <li> I tried twice/day for with no change at all. Felt tiny twinge but that did not result in any change. I looked for the \\&quot;fractionated silicon dioxide three dimensional nanoprisms that reflect light\\&quot; but they must only be seen under a microscope. I have a natural daylight bulb but still could not see even small lines/shadows diminish. The product felt slightly stickly at first and then like it was drying my skin but no sign of tightening as well as no sign of lip plumping, age spots diminishing or anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions say to \\&quot;dot LifeCell along the edge of the orbital bone ... directly under the eye ... 2 dots ... do not get closer\\&quot;. So how can \\&quot;eyelids appear lifted\\&quot;? Lots of hype on the box &amp; included letter but no results at all.  Waste of time &amp; money if you pay full price. I returned the trial.</li>
    <li> SCAM!! They  billed me $400 for my free trial and told me it was my banks fault!!! Dis honest frauds</li>
    <li> Besides being fraudulent the cream does NOT do anything that OLAY wouldn&#x27;t do.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and definitely DO NOT believe the &amp;#34;FREE&amp;#34; claim where you only pay s&amp;h.</li>
    <li> I just had to cancel my card to ensure no charges would be made on my account, if you ordered this product on the &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; you should do the same as my bank advised it was the best way to ensure that they will not charge you.</li>
    <li> I fell for the hype and ordered my \\&quot;free\\&quot; month trial.  It was NOT free, I was charged the shipping, which I accepted, but also charged the full $189 before the trial period was up.  Like pulling teeth to get my money back, but they allowed a $100 refund and I&#x27;ll keep and use the ONE TUBE for $89.&lt;br /&gt;It works well as a moisturizer, but no more so than my Estee Lauder.  There is some benefit to eye puffiness but by no means do puffs/bags disappear, and my puffs weren&#x27;t all that pronounced.  Wrinkles, alas, are still with me.&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles/deep lines on my chest were my target area, but I&#x27;ve seen only slight improvement, and the product must be used perpetually to achieve that slight improvement, and it&#x27;s toooo expensive... the exchange is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;d save money if I got some type of plastic surgery/laser treatment.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT FALL FOR THIS HYPE AND BUY THE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> When you order the &amp;#34;free trial size&amp;#34; know before you order that  you are also being shipped another bottle Lifecell will charge your account $189.  Iin addition  you are signing up for automatic renewals.  This information is not divulged on the first ad page but when filling out the information for your credit card to cover the shipping and handling.  You can opt out by returning, at your cost, the additional bottle you did not ask for. You then have to ask to be taken off the automatic renewal.  When I chatted with them about this issue being rather deceptive, they hung up.  If the product is so great, they ought to fulfill what the ad says and mail you the trial size as a test and if you like it you will order it.  Companies that have to deceive people are not worth doing business with.  I found out in time to cancel my order by reading the comments.  Don&#x27;t be like me, be informed.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this miracle cream. Waste of time and money. What I got was only pimples. I do not know how the cream has so many good reviews. Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> This product does absolutely nothing.  Furthermore, the free trial is not a free trial at all...you must return it or you are billed $189.00 plus you are put on an auto ship plan that you don&#x27;t know about until you look at your credit card bill.  I still haven&#x27;t gotten my money back from this scam company.  Don&#x27;t fall for this junk.</li>
    <li> Wow! \\&quot;See the improvement in 17 seconds!\\&quot; 17 seconds later - nothing. 1 week later, twice a day, as directed - nothing. I \\&quot;might\\&quot; keep trying if it was not so ridiculously expensive. As it is this \\&quot;trial\\&quot; will be sent back. ZERO STARS</li>
    <li> The seller was great, but the product does not work. Very expensive, no improvement in my skin what so ever,waste of money. would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> So I spent more on this \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; product than I&#x27;ve spent on any other. More or less because all the reviews seemed to be good (though I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s all hired or paid people.) Used it and the things I DO like about it are that it&#x27;s a non-greasy formula. I have oily skin but I am starting to get fine lines around my eyes so I was hoping to stop that problem before it actually becomes a problem. It&#x27;s a smooth formula. ut so are a lot of cheaper brands. And eventually this started to dry out my skin so i can&#x27;t imagine what it does for women who already have dry skin, especially in the winter which it is now. I had to go back to aveeno at night just so my skin wouldn&#x27;t flake because of lifecell. and we all know when your skin&#x27;s dry, wrinkles are emphasized. So with this on it was worse for putting on makeup eventually, when it STARTED OFF as better for makeup application. For the pricetag and absolutely no results I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend you waste your money. Civant skin care is a good brand. I used to use their hyperpigmentation formula and i heard they have a wrinkle cream as well. it&#x27;s all about a third of the price of this stuff and it will actually ydrate your skin without making it oily, dry or any extreme. try that instead if you want to spend more then 45 dollars on a product for such a small area of the body like your face. Waste of money, lifecell is. I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very Simply - It does nothing it claims. I tried it for a month on one side of my face so that I could compare. Absolutely no difference. If we would all do this and see what these products really do or don&#x27;t do, we could put a lot of quacks out of business. Don&#x27;t get sucked in to their \\&quot;free\\&quot; sample as it is only free if you send it back, and they&#x27;ll keep on sending and charging.</li>
    <li> Just today had the same experience as others.  Husband got convinced by the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; amount of $4.25 just for shipping a trial amount.  Within an hour, our debit account was charged twice:  once for $4.25 and then for $189.00.  Called the bank, they said we had to call the toll-free number furnished by the company first, then the bank.  We just called and were on hold for 15 minutes.  The waiting music is AWFUL and sounds like it was piped through a 1960 car radio speaker into the phone.  I am sure this is one way to stall and get people to give up trying to get their money back.  We were told that the $189 is a \\&quot;pre-authorization\\&quot; in case we don&#x27;t return the product within 30 days--more double talk!</li>
    <li> I have to believe that all the internet \\&quot;review\\&quot; site entries and the LifeCells own testimonials are all paid or planted.  Thank goodness for Amazon - I just wish I&#x27;d checked it out here before ordering.  After reading all the \\&quot;better than botox\\&quot; and \\&quot;like a facelift\\&quot; reviews, I was skeptical but eager to try it out.  Used it for about 4 months (I kept thinking something might happen if I stuck with it) with no discernible results.  It&#x27;s a fairly decent moisturizer, though it smells kind of awful and feels a little pasty in your hand.  But no wonder cream here, and the prices they charge for it and the hard sell that they put behind it are unconscionable.</li>
    <li> I did read the fine print and NOWHERE did it say that they would do a pre-authorization for the $189.00. My card was charged twice for $189.00. Luckily, my credit union called to let me know about it.  My other issue is that the website does not list all of the ingredients in this product.  It lists the ones that are fairly harmless but leave out the ingredients that are damaging to skin and in some cases downright dangerous, i.e., carcinogenic. I&#x27;ve had skin cancer twice, both times on my face.  I had surgery and reconstructive surgery.  I have no desire to go through that again.  So, after receiving the cream, I read the full list of ingredients.  I will be sending the product back.  My father always told me to never buy anything from Florida as the state has some of the weakest consumer protection policies in the US.  Should have paid attention!</li>
    <li> O.K. This is another ripoff. Trial &amp;#34; turn out to be extended automatic billing $$$$ yes first #189.00 then $149.00 till i noticed it on my bank account.  Called and the person was very rude. Got to look at the very fine print somewhere i guess. I maybe will get a refund for the October billing. so far ply got the little tube in the big box.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and it has worked well for me, I&#x27;m really satisfied. But i must point it out:  I did not expect a miracle cream that would remove my wrinkles and make me look 10 years younger, I don&#x27;t believe such a product exists (unfortunately). However, this cream does make my skin look smoother and more radiant. Improves the fine wrinkles a great deal, hydrates well, and I especially like that it absorbs within seconds. It does what a good &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; (sigh) / hydrating cream can/should do, nothing more, nothing less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem with the company, but I also haven&#x27;t canceled any order. They sent me 3 different products as free gifts (face-wash, supplements and cleanser) during the course of these 6 months, and have not added them  to my automatic order. I will consider continuing with the face-wash if they really don&#x27;t want to force it on me :)</li>
    <li> This product in my opinion is a complete waste of time. You might as well put water on your face</li>
    <li> This product doesnt work any better than much less expensive products. The price is way overboard. I am having trouble contacting this company to cancel further orders and charging my account. Dont order this product. It is a headache of worry not to be charged for further shipments and costs.</li>
    <li> I ordered a free sample last night. I checked my credit card statement tonight and they had charge me $189.</li>
    <li> People need to remember nothing in like is free. The free trial is free if you send the rest of the product back before 30 days. Also, if you use a gift card or a debit card the put a hold on that amount for a few days.... four days later I got my money back in my account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the product. I had been looking for something that would replace what I used to use because a company I was using changed formulas and it just no longer worked for me. I went through AuraVie and Hydroxone. Hydroxone was yuck and made me break out. AuraVie is amazing but it is 3 steps and more expensive than LifeCell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trepidatiously tried LifeCell hoping it would not only have a lot of benefits but also feel light on my skin, leave nothing oily, not break me out and show me results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the light reflecting properties in LifeCell, you see short term results instantly. I thought, \\&quot;Yeah right.... this is bull.\\&quot; But it is true. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 4 weeks now and see a big difference in my skin&#x27;s evenness, the tone and elasticity and where did my light crow&#x27;s feet go? Significant improvement on my neck area which is where I am most concern about. The skin is more firm and even. Scars evened out and my skin has a kind of glow to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still do use a couple other products... a hyaluronic acid serum and retinol gel at night after I apply LifeCell. (I do this because I am still afraid of my skin breaking out no matter what.... and the extra hyaluronic serum is simply added moisture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand the frustrations of feeling something is free and it not being so but that is no reason to come give the actual product a bad rating when it is a VERY good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it work, but it takes care of your entire skin routine aside from cleansing. It really has the ability to save money considering the products I was normally using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame seeing so many people here fighting over whether a product is free, or not. One should always fully read any advertisement for any trial offer. NONE of them are free..... but merely free for an \\&quot;x\\&quot; period of time and then you must return the product.uct is free, or not. One should always fully read any advertisement for any trial offer. NONE of them are free..... but merely free for an \\&quot;x\\&quot; period of time and then you must return the product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products. Most do a little to remove or fade my brown sun spots. This product did nothing in over a month. I wish the 17 seconds advertised worked! Also, the company charged me $189 and I never received the next shipment. The \\&quot;Free Trial\\&quot; is not free. Read the fine print not showing on your screen.</li>
    <li> Really makes a difference in the appearance of my skin.  Wish it didnt cost so much would buy it every month.  Wonderful product</li>
    <li> Tried Murad, Principle Secret, Youthology, and Beau Visage.  They did not give me the results I was hoping for.  I&#x27;m 55 and have been using the product for 7 months, I&#x27;m on my third tube.  My skin is brighter and tighter!!!  I have noticed my jowls are lifting and my &#x27;gobbler&#x27; is smaller. It smells great and is so easy to use, you only need one product (not three).  I was so impressed I gave it to my girlfriend for Christmas!!</li>
    <li> I had read reviews on several different sites but knew I wanted to order from Amazon if it was available. (I do LOVE Amazon) After reading all the reviews on Amazon I will find another way to deal with my wrinkles. I&#x27;m never comfortable ordering from a company that insists on auto ship to order and then you can cancel later. I did do this with Sheer Cover but I knew someone who used Sheer Cover and after a lot of research found them to be a reliable company. To everyone who has written a review on Amazon for anything I want to say thank you. People really do read this stuff.</li>
    <li> I ordered this through their website(FYI) they were only to charge me shipping $1.25 THEN after 30 days, if i don&#x27;t cancel, they would charge the $189. Right after I placed my order, I checked my bank account and they charged BOTH!!! The site clearly stated if you check off Credit card, you will pay only the shipping now, after 30 days they will charge the $189, but they immediately charged me both! I had to file a dispute with the bank, cancel my credit card, then when I called Lifecell, they lied to me saying they didn&#x27;t charge me when obviously they did because I just hung up with the bank and viewed with my own eyes the charges online. LIARS!! THIEVES!!!! SAVE YOURSELF THE AGGREVATION!!</li>
    <li> I am a face cream junkie! I don&#x27;t want to get OLD! It&#x27;s definitely an unhealthy fear, but I manage HAHA.&lt;br /&gt; So I have tried and hoarded from A-Z. My husband can&#x27;t watch the show \\&quot;Intervention\\&quot; without giving me and my face creams the side-eye.&lt;br /&gt;  So last month while enabling my addiction I came across the ad for an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; cream that could replace my 6 product routine, got the cream shipped to my job (TO AVOID THE SIDE EYE) and fell in love instantly! The texture was great, its not oily or greasy so no raccoon eyes &#x60;cause of smudgy eyeliner! But like all good things, love can be bittersweet :/&lt;br /&gt;  Lifecell didn&#x27;t replace all of my skincare products, I still have to apply SPF 15 and I still have to use a moisturizer since I live in super cold and dry Colorado, BUT it did replace my eye cream and anti aging serum. The effect I got from using lifecell is like nothing I&#x27;ve seen before. I saw skin tightening within 3 weeks. I even saw the fine lines on my lips start to disappear. I can wear red lipstick now and not feel insecure about the cracks! I love it.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic product, my husband noticed a difference after just one application. Thanks for the laser-fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I am 44 and purchased this product with some reservations - the advertising for it borders on offensive, plus, it is really rather more expensive than I prefer.  After some thought and realizing the product allegedly performs all functions in one easy application I decided to try it.  I was somewhat disappointed as the testimonials state I should see an improvement within 60 seconds.  After 8 weeks of use I have noticed improvement - my skin seems clearer/more radiant and there has been some definite reduction in the redness that plagues me at the outside corners of my eyes.  I recently tested the product on my 20 year old daughter by applying it to one half of her face.  Within 2 minutes her miniscule wrinkles very obviously vanished, so the product IS effective - just not quickly on old skin.  The texture of the product is unusual and for the first 5 weeks I noticed a slightly unpleasant distinctive \\&quot;burning skin\\&quot; smell.  That has ceased so maybe it was just the product doing its job?!?  All in all it did not work any miracles for me but I have noticed some improvement in my skin and it is quick and easy to use, no need for multiple separate products, also not much product is needed per application.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I love the way it makes the skin on my face feel. My complexion is actually already pretty good so I can&#x27;t say I noticed much improvement in appearance, except that maybe the dark circles under my eyes have faded somewhat. I&#x27;m still going to get botox for a couple of lines in the forehead - no difference on those that I can see. I mostly like the feel of it especially when I first apply it. It&#x27;s a thick cream with an odd color and smell in the tube, but it goes on smooth, clear, odorless and stays on all day, makes my skin a lot less dry definitely throughout the day. I believe the hype about all of the antioxidents so that makes me feel good when I touch my face.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  After. 6 months I have the same wrinkles but I&#x27;m out 1200 dollars.  Vaseline at 8 dollars a year is better</li>
    <li> The deal sounded too good to be true---and it was.  I fell into the trap of not reading the fine print and ended up having a charge of $189 show up on my credit card one day after the 30 day trial ended.  It didn&#x27;t help that the messages from the company went to spam.  Even so, they do not remind you that your 30 day trial period is coming to and end. It is an expensive lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the product, it is certainly not worth the amount of money they are asking for it.  I took my \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture and was truly giving it an honest effort.  I ended up breaking out a bit more and I still have my fine lines and wrinkles.  There really wasn&#x27;t enough of a benefit to warrant the price.  After hearing the report that companies pay people to leave positive reviews, I can only hope this is not true of this situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to coconut oil and other natural options for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I contacted customer service and found out that I could send the tube back within 120 days for a refund.  If you have ordered this product and you haven&#x27;t been hit with the charge, OR you are like many people who became ill after realizing that they didn&#x27;t understand the initial tactics of the company, contact customer service immediately at support@lifecellskin.com to cancel and to inform them you are sending the product back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to the form you need to fill out and the return address if you want to return the product and get out of the VIP membership club you are automatically signed up for:  lifecellskin.com/legal/returns.php</li>
    <li> In my opinion lifecell is just a waist of money. It didnt do anything to my skin.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the sorriest products I&#x27;ve ever tried (ok, I&#x27;ve tried a lot).  I had better results from basic over-the-counter products at the drug store. The best results yet have been from an herbalist who concocted this amazing skin tightening cream that I continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of this is the \\&quot;image\\&quot; of the standard product marketing approach of offering a sample they believe will sell again. This is NOT the case here. The sample is only a marketing ploy to suck you in and charge you dinero for dish soap.  Crappy product.  Misleading and deceptive marketing tactics.  I can&#x27;t be more emphatic that you SHOULD NOT USE THIS JUNK!!</li>
    <li> I think this product is good and does what it says.  However, I have only used it for a brief time and I am still unsure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Scam but Chase will credit you if you used a Chase card! (Amazon&#x27;s rewards Visa credit card is CHASE)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell for the Life Cell scam as well and was in shock when I got my Amazon credit card bill and saw the $189 charge. I called LC and complained. They said &#x27;send it back and we will credit you&#x27;. Sure...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I called Chase customer service who issues the Amazon credit card. I LOVE my Amazon credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chase said they will; 1)credit my account today for $189 and 2)I don&#x27;t have to send this back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if anyone used a Chase card for this purchase thinking it was only for shipping charges...call Chase and they will help you resolve this immediately.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my life - cell products and try them out..but was sadly disappointed in the first couple of uses.  My skin started to become dry immediately. ..I am not sure if it is due to the face wash or the cream but I know I can&#x27;t use this product without a moisturizer.....do they make one?</li>
    <li> Please read the reviews of this product on scambook, it is alleged from the reviews that when you sign up for the trial and use your credit card to pay for the postage of the trial product, they take hundreds of dollars out of folks accounts without permission...BE VERY WARNED ABOUT THIS COMPANY, DO YOUR RESEARCH ON IT !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I have decided not to order.  It sounds like the company does not truly believe in their product.  Too many people were charged before the 30 day trial was over. If results were as promised there would be no worry about reorders.  Feeling like I made a great decision on not ordering.</li>
    <li> I placed an order for a free sample, which I received, and a month later they charged my debit card for $189! I did not agree to buy anything else from them nor the contacted me asking for my approval. This product does nothing special for your skin; I used it for a week and didn&#x27;t see any improvement. My regular face creams are superior and less than half the price. It&#x27;s a scammmmm.</li>
    <li> Worst cream I have ever used, did nothing at all at any stage for my skin, in fact brought me out in spots, which I never had even as a teenager</li>
    <li> I was very interested in this product but because of my past experiences I chose to click the Order Your LifeCell Trial Today‎ option.&lt;br /&gt;the shipping for the trial offer was $15.00 billed to my bank that day.&lt;br /&gt;The very next day lifecell billed my bank with another charge of $198.00.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted lifecell and requested the return of the $198.00 which I did not approve of at which time I was subjected to an argument about  small print etc, it became an unbelievable game of words.&lt;br /&gt;At that time I requested cancel my membership. I also canceled it thru email.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the problem was  solved&lt;br /&gt; today I received a email exclaiming &amp;#34;Good News &amp;#34; informing me that a new order for lifecell has been shipped My account was billed $150.00. I may have to get an attorney to get this under control</li>
    <li> Very happy with Life Cell. I have line above my lips I do not like. Life Cell is making them go away. I was told I looked refresh. I am 61 year young.</li>
    <li> I admit that I \\&quot;bit\\&quot; on the \\&quot;free\\&quot; sample and was charged $189 for not returning it within 30 days.  Well, how would you know if a product worked if you didn&#x27;t try it for more than 30 days?  From what I could see in the two weeks that I tried the product, it \\&quot;erased\\&quot; a few lines with its mineral based foundation, but did nothing to moisturize my skin. In fact, I tossed it out after two weeks.  If I want to pay big bucks for skin cream, I am going back to the Radical product line that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just talked with a customer service representative who told me that there was no limit on the time for the free trial, and when I told her I already had the product, she said \\&quot;Yikes!\\&quot;  There is a time limit, so send it back within 30 days or you are stuck for $189.  And then she informed me that the fine print also \\&quot;subscribed\\&quot; me to $149 per month further shipments of the product unless I call to cancel.  So be warned: Read the small print, which, by the way, is not available for you to read until you are about to place the order for the free sample.</li>
    <li> I ordered the cream through their website and it does say in fine print what you will be charged for first time users which for me was a total of 4.25, but it does NOT say that the card that you used will have a pending charge of 189.00 for 4 days which also should be included in the fine print. The pending charge did drop but still they hold your money for 4 days,not right at all and for that financial headache they get only 3stars..anyways with that said,the cream is amazing,I love it,so I give the cream 5 STARS. I am a 38 Hispanic woman with 5kids and I have started to notice the stress on my face,lol..I feel and see a difference,I actually like how I look without my makeup!! It is pricey but I have spent more on other face products without any results,at least with this I get some results..my warning if you do order their cream through their website use a gift card!!!

    <li> I have used it about 4 months and my complexion just gets better. Freckles fading skin younger, wrinkles around my mouth looking better with each month.</li>
    <li> Ladies and gentlemen, this product works.  I am 65 and have the usual signs of aging.  The price took my breath away, but cheaper than surgery or shots.  And I have lost more money at casinos.  And I have wasted more than this sum on products that I used once.  So, I talked myself into purchasing this product.  The results are unbelievable.  Since I have used this product, my neck wrinkles have diminished considerably.  The overall appearance of my face wrinkles have also diminished considerably.  This product also has worked on diminishing those insufferable wrinkles around my lips. My jawline has also tightened.  I wish I could buy a barrel of this stuff.  I would sit in it everyday!</li>
    <li> I was lured in by the initial trial of $1.25 for 30 days and return if not satisfied. I was immediately unsatisfied. Not only did they charge me the $1.25, in addition they put a \\&quot;hold\\&quot; on my accounts for $189.00, which overdrew my acct. After three days that dropped off but the damage had been done to the time of $100. I called and got the snottiest customer service person I hhave had the displeasure of dealing with. They told me to put it in an envelope which.I did and shipped it back. Unfortunately i did not use registered mail or any tracking. Fast forward two weeks later I am enrolled in their revolving charge of $189.00 mo and now $300 overdrawn. Again called their rude customer service who said basically I was lying never sent their product back and basically tough toenails. I have filed fraud with my bank and placed stop payment on anything to do with their name. BEWARE!</li>
    <li> This cream feels like it burned my face.  It  got very very dry and next day looked burned.  did not go on like face cream.  thank you amazon for taking it back and returning my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this stuff! It really does make my skin look younger I think. It also works as a great primer for your make-up, like I had read before purchasing. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I tried it twice with a good rest in between to start with a &amp;#34;fresh face&amp;#34;.  Each time, my skin became red and irritated after two days.  I had ordered what I thought was a free sample for shipping of $5.99.  However, they charged my credit card for $189 about a month later.  When I called they said it was not a free sample and I had to return the product to get a refund.  Their website looks legit, but there are a lot of other things on the internet from other people like me who have had trouble.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> Sure, if you want to pay (monthly) $150.00 for a 2.54 oz. cream that does zilch - it&#x27;s your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They rope you in with the &#x27;free&#x27; (only pay the S&amp;H) and then your CC will be charged $189.00 if you don&#x27;t return in 30 days (I&#x27;ve seen people who did return their cream and STILL not recoup the $189.00.  Then they start charging you $149.00 a month since you&#x27;re now in the VIP program and get a discount!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am now disputing both of those charges with CC - we&#x27;ll see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, just go down to the local department store that carries a good skin program and get your skin cream there&lt;br /&gt;This company is a SCAM.</li>
    <li> This is a scam they charge your credit card $189. after 30 days. It is a big ripoff, and it does not work</li>
    <li> I wish I had read these reviews before being taken in by this company&#x27;s promise of a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; offer.  You only have to pay shipping and handling, yeah right.  Obviously hidden somewhere in the small print is that they will bill you $189 one month later.  I noticed no improvement in my skin or wrinkles, either.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 or 3 years.  It really does all they say--tightens and smooths the skin.  Times when I have run out of it reinforces how much I like it and how well it works.  It&#x27;s expensive, but does the job.  It&#x27;s well worth the expense.</li>
    <li> Ever since I have been using this people have ask me if I have had a face lift. It is noticeable in my neck area.&lt;br /&gt;Almost all the wrinkles on my neck are gone. I also have noticed my skin is softer and more even. I have been using this&lt;br /&gt;product for over 3 months. The longer you use it the better your skin gets. it will not happen over night but with time&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I am a big believer in reviews.  I love to read reviews and I believe in reviews... when I know they are from real people!  Yes, there are a lot of false claims about success with products.  I do believe some people are paid to lie. The bad stuff first...yes, I was charged $180 when it was supposed to be a \\&quot;trial month\\&quot; and I fully expected that, given the reviews.  I decided to go ahead and take the plunge since SOME people were reporting good success with LifeCell.  Well, it&#x27;s been a week now and I&#x27;ve seen AMAZING improvement in reduced visibily of my crowsfeet...EVEN WHEN I SMILE!  Just like the claims say, this stuff seems to dramatically reduce fine lines and may even eliminate them??! Unlike other Amazon&#x27;iers I DO feel it working, and my skin tightens when I put it on.  After a night of wearing it, I wake up with very taunt skin around my eyes.  It&#x27;s also helping with puffiness SOMEWHAT.  I am a 33 year old, white female with fine lines that are dissappearing with LifeCell, and I am not getting paid to say that. You should know that I am not putting LifeCell all over my face, just on my eye area.  I use Miracle Worker Retinod Pads for my face. Also, it should be noted that I am doing Carole Maggio face exercises daily too, which I think are working from the bottom up. However, I didn&#x27;t see improvement in my CROWSFEET LINES until I started using LifeCell a week ago.  I hope you find this review helpful.</li>
    <li> I used twice a day for 6 weeks and saw very little difference, so for me it is not worth the price.  I tried the free trial and did not have any difficulty returning the product at the end of the trial and did not have any problems with my credit card being charged as so many others have mentioned here.  But giving only 2 stars because it just did not do anything above and beyond moisturizing.  I can get that from a much less expensive cream.</li>
    <li> I ordered this trial cream supposed to have instant results. I&#x27;m approaching 40 so I don&#x27;t have hoards of wrinkles so I should have been able to notice some change. It&#x27;s not instant. It actually never even happens. I didn&#x27;t notice a thing. It just felt like nice lotion on my skin. I don&#x27;t know what the hype is. I also was disappointed in the customer service end of this company. They held my account for the 189.00 charge even after their marketing says no money down. I got overdrafted one fee for this. So it&#x27;s the old saying \\&quot;nothing is for free\\&quot; I&#x27;ve learned my lesson on these trial memberships. I&#x27;m sending this back, careful to make sure I&#x27;ve followed all their rules for returning. Hoping but not totalling trusting they won&#x27;t debit me anyway. Don&#x27;t try this product or trial membership. It is not worth the hassel. Micro crystals to reflect light? come on, can&#x27;t believe I fell for that one!&lt;br /&gt; [[ASIN:B007R5ZISK LifeCell Resveratrol Ultra Resveratrol Hyaluronic Acid Anti Aging Antioxidants]]</li>
    <li> My wife and I tried it. We are both in our late 40&#x27;s. Didn&#x27;t do a damn thing for either of us. A total waste of money. We didn&#x27;t actually expect it to work - my wife teaches chemistry and biology at UCLA - but we wanted to be sure. Crap. Total crap. If you buy this stuff you deserve to get screwed. We cancelled and did NOT pay the insane $189 and when they dragged their feet about refunding us, we threatened to sue (and meant it) and were quickly refunded.</li>
    <li> I used this product since August 20. I have noticed nothing has changed. I still have had wrinkles and fine lines on my forehead. My skin looks dull also. Overall impression i still look tired and my skin is still not firm or tight. I think the product is not that effective on me. Maybe this product is more effective to those who have nice skin. I&#x27;d rather take deer velvet collagen, hyaluronic acid, more protein and dietary supplements,fruits,egetables,nuts.  I&#x27;d definitely not recommend this product to anyone. I think l&#x27;oreal, olay regenerist, clear n grow, aveno, etc works better on me. i&#x27;d rather shop at walmart for beauty products or other stores around.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I purchased this product a year ago. Well, it works! All my friends ask me what kind of cream I use. I look much younger than 38. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!!! They still advertising in internet the \\&quot;free\\&quot; one month trial.Its not free!! Dont give them your credit card details.They will charge you full price!!!It happened to me and many others!!! And the cream doesnt work,in fact my skin felt uncomfortably dry after using it. I still used it for few weeks,but didnt notice any difference. Really,there are no magic creams.The only thing that really works for me is botox...</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was just another product with misleading claims.  But after approximately two weeks, I noticed my skin had really improved.  Not only were wrinkles less noticable, but my pores were smaller and my mild acne gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good stuff.</li>
    <li> Lifecell is pretty ineffective compared to most other wrinkle-reducing creams.  it may reduce wrinkles because it tightens the skin a little on your face,but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize effectively, and the next day whether you use it again or not, your face feels dry.  I don&#x27;t recommend it, and whatever you do, don&#x27;t order a $25 sample from the LifeCell site.  That comes, then the next month a $189 charge appeared on my credit card statement with nothing to show for it, and the second month I was charged $149 for a shipment of 3products I never ordered either.  I&#x27;m now in the middle of disputing those charges through my credit card company.  The &amp;#34;trial sample&amp;#34; has turned into a trial for me!</li>
    <li> Although the cream is nice , it certainly does not live up to it&#x27;s claims.  After using it for a month following the directions exactly, I found no improvement .  Not worth the price !</li>
    <li> This is a nice product and a good moisturizer. however it is pretty expensive. I may or may not order more</li>
    <li> This stuff does nothing. I&#x27;ve been using Derma e Firming DMAE  moisturizer and so far it seems pretty good, but nothing will do miracle work.</li>
    <li> THE SHIPPING WAS CHEAP BUT THE $189.00 FOR THE PRODUCT WAS OUTRAGEOUS,NEVER SAW THAT NOT NOR THE NOT THAT SAID THEY WILL SHIP OTHER PRODUCTS WITHOUT CONTACTING YOU,THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE SO IF THEY GET YOUR DEBIT CARD THEY WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT, THEY SAID THEY SHIPPED SEVERAL PRODUCTS TO ME BUT NEVER GOT THEM, BUT I PAID FOR THEM, NEVER KNEW HOW CROOKED THESE PEOPLE COULD BE WATCH OUT, DONT GIVE YOUR CREDIT CARD YOU WONT GET IT BACK</li>
    <li> I agree with many of the previous reviews written about this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34;!  It is overpriced and does nothing to help one&#x27;s skin.  I too was one of the silly people who agreed to sign-up for the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; sample and did not return the tube in time before being charged $189.00!  Unfortunately it is not possible to give this non facial cream a 0 star rating, I wish I could!!!  Please do not waste your money on this &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; but instead buy from a respected company such as DHC.</li>
    <li> lt is a scam!&lt;br /&gt;I got charged $189 instead of advertised $4.95 for S&amp;H.&lt;br /&gt;If you order the 30 day trial this is what you&#x27;l get!</li>
    <li> I too was looking forward to this product, but I have seen no difference in my face.  I live in Colorado and this product does not provide enough to combat the dry weather.  I am going to send it back.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product (and the promised bonus products) about three shipments ago.  For the second and third shipment I got a Woops! card explaining that they had sent out too many and had run out.  The promised bonus never arrived, although the card indicated that they would be shipped asap (apparently p is a much longer concept for them than for me).  I sent emails inquiring about this.  I received a return email telling me that my email would be answered in turn, but my turn never came.  It has been three weeks now.  I finally called to cancel when I received notice that another shipment was on the way.  I waited on the phone for 12 minutes to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is average; certainly doesn&#x27;t produce the results promised but a fair moisturizer.  However, I don&#x27;t put up with poor customer service under any circumstances.</li>
    <li> Hello all you beautiful, hopeful people! I have been a lawyer, litigator and, for the past 18 years, a judge during my legal career of 57 years...... and being 84 years old, have developed a few wrinkles, learned a lot about business and the chase for the American dollar.  I too am searching for a product advertised and promoted as a real cure containing new and miraculous ingredients....and have yet to find one........but, in my adventures through life, the one thing that rings true in the world of advertising and that is the method used by the purveyors of dubious products is always the same......So, if you are told everything about all the GOOD things a product, if it does anything, but nothing about the BAD,.....lookout, it&#x27;s probably a duck....you know what I mean........</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I come here first to use the review system.. :(  The product did not help with fine lines, wrinkles or discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;I have the same experience as others listed here.&lt;br /&gt;If you do not want to waste an hour of your life on the phone via hold; because your credit card was charged without your consent for a sample, then &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t believe the hype!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This is a complete scam and misdirection and even the BBB states this company is not accredited.&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to using Lamer..</li>
    <li> I ordered a sample of the product and unfortunately did not read the entire ad and they charged me $189 extra, when the ad leaves you to believe that it is a free sample. It&#x27;s my fault for not thoroughly reading what I was signing up for, but their ad was completely misleading. NOT COOL life cell, NOT COOL.</li>
    <li> I was about to buy this product, this is why I love Amazon real people, with honest opinions not the hype, I am glad instead of going to the site, I strolled over to amazon to get real reviews on this product.... will not be buying, stick to my Vitamin C regimen.... Thanks Ladies....</li>
    <li> A royal ripoff guys. STAY AWAY from this company. It&#x27;s a very expensive scam! Look at my other reviews on amazon - you will see that I write honest opinions on products I purchase and try hard to find a use of them even if they don&#x27;t exactly fit my purpose . I am not a whiner. But I hate having been taken advantage of in such an obscene manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the trial version from the company&#x27;s website, and I was willing to pay for the face cream, which I received in about a week. After 3 months I received another package with a refill and my credit card was charged again. I checked the original email receipt of my purchase and it did not mention anything about an automatic refill of my initial order. I called the customer service and they told me that there is a default check-box of &amp;#34;VIP refill&amp;#34; when you order the product first time. I do not recall such a checkbox, and even if it was, there should have been included in my email receipt. Hard to demonstrate that there wasn&#x27;t any such checkbox on the online form after the fact, with no trace of it in my original receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get nothing for 200 $. This product is no more effective than any cheap face moisturizing cream from the drug store. They have however a very aggressive advertising campaign and it not hard to fall for their deceit.</li>
    <li> This cream is very expensive and after nearly a month of using it as directed, I saw very little improvement, certainly nothing like the facelift results that the company proclaims.  The free sample they send is a 2.54oz sample but if you do not return it by the end of the month, you will be charged $189.  The return time is not sufficient for you to use the product for the full 30 days and then return if you do not think it worked.  If you do a search on this product to find out if it is a scam, you will just get more ads for a free sample, any search with &amp;#34;lifecell&amp;#34; in it will be redirected to a site for a free sample, there are many many of these sites.  The way they make their money is by sending the sample and then collecting on those who do not return it in time.  Do not get hooked in, there is nothing free in life.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and did not think it was worth the money.  It did NOT visibly improve my skin.  I had to contact them 3 ties to cancel the shipments.  I finally got it handled today and am sending the last one back.  The snippy representative sounded like she was reading from a script for her responses.&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can save someone else the problems I have had with this company.</li>
    <li> This product does not work and they charge you $200 for a \\&quot;free\\&quot; trial.  In addition, they use bots to seed Google results with positive reviews.  Bad Stuff.  Stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have purchased this product, please add your name to the Better Business Bureau complaints: [...]</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I use this in combination with La Mer and Retinol and it&#x27;s a fabulous combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very light and does not leave a greasy or heavy feeling on your skin.  It has a very unique texture and is almost like a velvet film between your skin and makeup if you choose to wear it.  I personally did not experience the light reflecting wrinkle erasing effect but I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles so may work better on others in that respect but I love how this moisturizes my skin without making it feel like there is something on my face.  It&#x27;s a lovely light cream that does moisturize and you notice a firmer, tighter, glowing skin.  That&#x27;s why I continue to use this.</li>
    <li> They charged me the $4.25 for the free sample shipping fee - and right behind it they charged me $189 for an unauthorized purchase!  I am going to cancel my credit card to stop the insanity.  BofA says I have to wait for the charge to post before I can dispute it or I should contact LifeCell - which looks like they will not respond positively.  I cannot believe I fell for it!  Fool me once...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay&lt;br /&gt;The product is not very effective as claimed to be. Makes 1 month use regularly twice a day as recommended, I noticed little difference and did not notice any immediate result, as it says to do. Not bad but for now I see no difference to other products, nothing new unfortunately. Actually I&#x27;ve used better products and cheaper.</li>
    <li> Note this product was purchased from the company direct and not through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrives on time, communication is good, packaging excellent.  D celebrity endorsements great !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this company was as good at making an anti-wrinkle cream as they are taking your money and hiding behind fine print then it would probably work amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product(I am 43 YO Guy) and noticed nothing , nothing at all happened it was a complete waste of money and I used it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free trial has fine print ...you are signing up for a $190 purchase plus shipping.  I have to cancel my credit card now to avoid them charging me more...so annoying that I was so stupid but I can tell you that this company is extremely good in making you feel secure and safe whilst scheming the final result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this company</li>
    <li> I gave Lifecell a full six months. And it works. My skin is smooth, supple, pores have shrunk ..I love this product and their eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;NOW, I still use Lifecell/ and I have incorporated Neova into the mix...2 days Neova/ 2 days life cell. I am 56 years old/ I work in the sun..I have a gardening business. I hardly have a wrinkle. I get compliments on my skin...ALL THE TIME. so...for all you guys who used it for a week, two weeks, a month...NOTHING works that fast.</li>
    <li> Do NOT order this product.  They lead you to believe that it is a FREE trial offer, so you order it, and then a month later you discover that you&#x27;ve been charged $189.00 and you&#x27;ve become a customer for life!!&lt;br /&gt;The product isn&#x27;t even good!  I will certainly read the small print next time I order a TRIAL product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the trial sample they need your credit card number  then charge you immediately the $189 and will continue to send you the cream and charge your credit card...&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews carefully ..  It seems to be a less than honest company ..</li>
    <li> From what I read on Amazon, I was very afraid to try this product. However, I decided to get it directly from SouthBeach instead of Amazon. I had very little expectations and I was very pleasantly surprised. The 17-second guarantee of smooth skin actually works! My wrinkles do seem to disappear, until I wash my face off. I use LifeCell in the morning before going to work and in the evening before bed. Granted, I have only been using it for the last 30 days (will update this review in another month), but my skin is noticeably smoother. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews here, but like one reviewer said, it appears to work for some people and not for others. I have tried to get 2 of my sisters to try it, and they both were pretty much amazed, like I did. It works for them (I now want them to get their own tube, not sharing mine). I agree that the price is very high, as compared to Estee Lauder products which I have been using, but I like the concept of using just one product for everything.  If you cannot afford the price, call LifeCell customer service and discuss it, they might be able to give you a discount. The lack of SPF is a minor inconvenience. I just wait for the LifeCell cream to absorb, then put on a sunscreen before I go out. I believe them when they say their anti-aging ingredients would be interfered with by the addition of sunscreen to the tube. Hey, they already combined 6 products into one : anti-wrinkle, skin firming, antioxidant, de-hyperpigmentation, hydrator, make-up base/primer.  It has simplified my life immensely. PS: I do not work for LifeCell, and I am still on my first tube. I sometimes wonder if the 5-star rating comes from the company&#x27;s employees and the 1-star rating from the company&#x27;s rivals. But my review is a genuine review and will be updated in the future.  I just hate for people (like me) to use the low cumulative rating (2.5 stars overall on this product) on a product on Amazon to avoid trying this amazing cream.  I was comforted by the fact that they do offer a 120-day refund.&lt;br /&gt;So try it for yourself.ted by the fact that they do offer a 120-day refund.&lt;br /&gt;So try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I read through their very confusing explanation on their website and condensed the information defining the trial period and their return policy.  They, in my opinion, try to make it difficult in order to trip you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRIAL PERIOD - Your 30 Day Trial Period starts when the order is placed.&lt;br /&gt;* You will be responsible to pay Shipping and Handling charges for your first shipment of LifeCell. If you wish to cancel your order within your Trial Period, simply call 1-866-977-1412 and return your tube within 30 days from shipping date and you will not be charged anything other than the shipping and handling fee.&lt;br /&gt;* Shipping time is estimated to be three to five (3-5) calendar days and is included in your 30 Day Trial Period, so you will have approximately twenty-five (25) calendar days to evaluate the Product.&lt;br /&gt;* You can cancel any time by contacting Customer Care Department at 1-866-977-1412 or visit online at [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RETURN MERCHANDISE AUTHORIZATION - If you follow the procedures outlined in this paragraph, you will not be charged for the Product you received during the 30 Day Trial Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Returned packages require a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number to ensure accurate processing.&lt;br /&gt;* Upon contacting Company and cancelling your order, you will be provided with a Return Merchandise Authorization (\\&quot;RMA\\&quot;) number.&lt;br /&gt;* You must write the RMA number on the return packaging in order to avoid being billed for the Product.  After canceling your order, you must return the unused portion of the Product or the empty tube to our Company.&lt;br /&gt;* An RMA number can ONLY be obtained by contacting the Customer Care Department by phone or on the web.&lt;br /&gt;* We recommend all returned items to be sent using some type of third party delivery confirmation system to ensure proper delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Return Address&lt;br /&gt;Returned Products must be sent to the following address:&lt;br /&gt;South Beach Skincare&lt;br /&gt;1909 Tyler Street, Suite 700&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood, FL 33020/&gt;Hollywood, FL 33020</li>
    <li> Bought for a girlfriend and we broke up before I could see the results.  Oh well....that will teach me next time</li>
    <li> Ridiculously expensive product that does nothing.  Don&#x27;t even think about doing the free trial.  They require a credit card number the automatically bill you.  I have no explanation for why I fell for this nonsense.  If the product really worked, they wouldn&#x27;t need your credit card.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give it a try and ordered it directly from the company website. Using a debit card you are warned \\&quot;When using a debit card, your bank may authorize your card by creating a pending transaction on your account. If you see this on your account, it&#x27;s only a temporary authorization and will disappear in a few days. It is NOT a charge. We do not charge your card (besides shipping &amp; handling) for 30 days.\\&quot; THEY DO NOT SAY THE AMOUNT. It is $189.00 even a pending transaction subtracts your available balance.&lt;br /&gt;I called the company and was treated as though I just didn&#x27;t read the page correctly. You see above all there is to read. The only amounts shown are Shipping and Handling:$2.25&lt;br /&gt; Environmentally Friendly Packaging:$2.00 Your Total Today:$4.25&lt;br /&gt;I was treated like it was all my fault and was called four times that day by them and told I \\&quot;better refuse the 30 trial immediately unopened\\&quot; when I receive it. Really? What about the trial period?  If this product were legitimate wouldn&#x27;t they just sell it without the tricks?</li>
    <li> This is a rich, non-greasy, quickly absorbed moisturizer. It is very, very good.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for a month, but I can&#x27;t claim to see a real change in the appearance of my already-established wrikles or in the firmness of my aging skin. On the other hand, I have been using various alpha-hydroxy creams, glycolic acids treatments and other anti-aging creams for many years, and in general, people are surprised at my actual age when I tell them. I do believe several of these products work somewhat over time. I am 65 and do look considerably younger. However, I don&#x27;t look YOUNG and don&#x27;t expect to. Nothing short of more invasive treatments such as plastic surgery, skin resurfacing or botox injections will make the magical difference that many products claim. Do some of your own research before you spend hundreds of dollars on products with unrealistic or even totally false claims.</li>
    <li> Well----I was crazy enough to place an order for the &amp;#34;30 day&amp;#34; free supply this am. I then go to my bank statement and find where I was charged for $189.00. Oh, how I wish I had read this page first. I will move heaven and earth to get this taken care of. I have notified my bank via email tonight and will go to the bank tomorrow to stop payment.</li>
    <li> Firstly, many companies use this same \\&quot;scam\\&quot; method of selling - and yes, I do agree it is a reprehensible method and should be illegal, but it isn&#x27;t. You WILL be charged! Be warned and be careful, please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, do any of you know how safe all of these ingredients are? My best advice is to look up every single one unless you are familiar with them (in which case, all you PhD organic and  biochemists can probably skip this step).&lt;br /&gt;Yes, we all know what some of them are, like water and oat and shea butter, but what about titanium dioxide - we are all familiar with it, but do you know what it is used for? It&#x27;s a whitener like zinc oxide and the standard is nano-sized particles. Those nano particles are absorbed through the skin and can get INSIDE of your cells where they wreak untold damage. I make my own sunscreen using micronized zinc oxide rather than nanonized for that very reason. (yes, it works great!) Is anyone in your family allergic to soy? Well, it&#x27;s in this as well: Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil.  How about Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate)? Sounds good, right? It&#x27;s synthetic, and toxic in even low doses, and absorbed through the skin and into the body where the liver has to detoxify it.&lt;br /&gt; [...]&lt;br /&gt; [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a full list from [...]&lt;br /&gt;  Water (Aqua)&lt;br /&gt;  C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;  Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract&lt;br /&gt;  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Fruit&lt;br /&gt;  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)&lt;br /&gt;  Cetearyl Alcohol (Plant Derived)&lt;br /&gt;  Silicon Oxide&lt;br /&gt;  Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;  Glycerin (Plant Derived)&lt;br /&gt;  Cetearyl Glucoside&lt;br /&gt;  Sclerotium Gum&lt;br /&gt;  Iron Oxides&lt;br /&gt;  Thioctic Acid (a-Lipoic Acid)&lt;br /&gt;  Tetrahydrobisdemethoxydiferuloylmethane&lt;br /&gt;  Spilanthes Acmella Flower Extract&lt;br /&gt;  Retinol (Vitamin A)&lt;br /&gt;  Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract [This is apple]&lt;br /&gt;  Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Stabilized Vitamin C)&lt;br /&gt;  Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil&lt;br /&gt;  DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol)&lt;br /&gt;  Cupric Carbonate Hydroxide (Mala&#x27;Kite) [Try Malachite!

If a product takes 1 or 10 years to make you ill or damage your body, what&#x27;s the good of looking nice? What&#x27;s the good of looking 10 years younger in your coffin at the ripe &#x27;old&#x27; age of 68?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourthly, there is no law governing the safety testing of cosmetics in the USA. It is all left up to the companies that make them, and they can claim anything that they can sort-of demonstrate, namely effectiveness. In fact, they can flat out lie and get away with it until enough people complain and band together to threaten or actually bring a lawsuit against said company. Most companies ignore isolated complaints until it impacts their bottom line: money. Safety testing is left totally up to the company marketing the product for money - and they&#x27;ll say/claim/do anything to get it. Money, that is. Look around you, do we look healthy to anyone? Hardly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifthly, please understand that if a product has just one dangerous ingredient in it, that makes it a dangerous product. Think of it this way, if I hand you a pitcher of fresh, clean spring water you&#x27;d drink it, right? Me too. If I put ONE DROP of cyanide (HCN) in it, would you still drink it? Me neither. But it is only one ingredient, and it is a very small amount, about 1/20th of a milliliter. Our reasoning, of course, is why take the chance? But we unknowingly do so every day. Cosmetics have many ingredients, and many of them augment each other, meaning that the toxicity of each individual ingredient is magnified by combining it with other toxic ingredients. In the unlikely event that there is any safety testing done at all, it is done on the individual ingredient, not on the combination(s). Also not taken into consideration is the fact that most people use several different skincare and cosmetic products, further increasing and magnifying the toxic effects. (This is why I make my own everything - you can too, just sharpen your google-fu.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That this product works for some I have no doubt. It may even work for the majority, but the question remains: Is It Safe?&lt;br /&gt;Read the book:&lt;br /&gt;Dying to Look Good : The Disturbing Truth About What&#x27;s Really in Your Cosmetics, Toiletries and Personal Care Products by Christine H.

    <li> am letting people know do not get free trail of this cream as there is nothing free about it. I got FREE! trail that cost around 9 pound but the company went into my bank account and took out another 112 pound a few days later then to add insult to injury they went and took another 112 pound in January unfortunately I did not notice the first amount as I thought it was something I bought online for one of the children for Christmas it wasn&#x27;t until I sat down and look through my account that I realized it was this company that is selling this cream that had gone into my account and taken the money. As for the cream I received one tube 75ml which I thought was the free trail which has cost me over 200 pounds I had go to my bank  to get them to cancel any debits to this company.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing this cream has managed to do for me is add on a few years due to the stress and got me into dept. PLEASE DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. I DID NOT SET UP A DIRECT DEBIT OR I DID NOT THINK I WAS SETTING UP A DIRECT DEBIT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN. YOUVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried it for a month--stopped using all the other stuff and just used this. I noticed a definite decrease in discoloration and increased softness, decreased crow&#x27;s feet. However, not sure the difference is worth the price. I have a feeling I would have to use it exclusively for months to really benefit and who wants to spend $90/month? (Assuming the tube lasts 2 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, they do NOT offer a &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; they offer a trial period and if you don&#x27;t send it back you get billed the full amount. Read the fine print. However, if you order a tube every two months, you get it for $149 -- so that&#x27;s better. I&#x27;m still going to try a few other products that are cheaper first, but if they don&#x27;t compare, I&#x27;m dumping everything in my cupboard and sticking with this. I love having ONE product for moisturizing, lightening and wrinkles. Just wish is was not so expensive.</li>
    <li> I only paid $100.00 for it when I bought it now it is $200 I will not pay that much its ok sure it helps wrinkles only when you wear it wash it off and the wrinkles are back</li>
    <li> Please be aware of the way this is marketed. It is marketed as a free trial where you will only be charged for shipping. My credit card was charged for the full amount of $189. When I called my credit card company, they were fully aware of this company and the scheme. Unfortunately, they also have continued to ship to me without authorization and have continued to charge my credit card.The product itself was not effective.</li>
    <li> This product is a rip off and the company operates in a dishonest manner.  They advertise a &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; that is not free and once they have your credit card details BEWARE.  They send you more product even if you don&#x27;t want it.  Canceling is time consuming and you don&#x27;t get all your money back.  I should have known better!</li>
    <li> I was tempted to order this product because of the great reviews on their site.  However, when I read the small print at the bottom of their order form I closed my browser prior to entering my credit card information.  Sad to say I have gotten caught up in similar product sales and I will never do that again.  If this cream is so great then I should be able to go to my local cosmetic store and purchase it without having to pay shipping and handling.  After checking out other sites reviewing this cream, I remembered a saying my parents taught me, if it is too good to be true...</li>
    <li> I order this from their website and I love it!!!  And every 2 months I get free stuff!!  The price is a little lower on auto ship and it is the only product I now need.  I use it once a day on clean fresh washed skin.  I let it soak in for 15 minutes before I continue with other products.  It also makes my lips fuller it I rub it into my lips until I drink or eat.  I have a glow I have never had and my pores are almost gone around my nose.  I am 52 and I am on my second tube.  I cannot say enough about this great cream!!!  My husband notices the difference and so do my girls.  I look 40 thanks to LifeCell.</li>
    <li> I, too, foolishly ordered LifeCell&#x27;s Trial Offer. Used it twice &amp; it caused a slight red rash on my skin. I stopped using but, fortunately, kept the product in a drawer. Today I received notification from my credit card company of a $189 + charge from LifeCell. I called &amp; was told they would refund the money if I returned the product! Luckily, I hadn&#x27;t discarded the product! Buyer beware. These Trial Offers are more often a sham than not!</li>
    <li> I ordered a free sample of this product from another website.  I got a large bottle.  I saw a $189 charge on my account.  I called and they said it would pend for a few days as a precautionary means.  After 30 days, it charged to my account.  I called and they said that if I didn&#x27;t return the product in 30 days, I purchased it.  It was free only for 30 days.  This was not made CLEAR in the advertising.  I then asked if I, not knowingly, was also signed up to get a charge of $189 per month and shipment ongoing.  THey did say it was in the fine print.  They said yes.  I never used the product, so I cannot review the product itself, but I can review that the company does not have good business methods which makes me skeptical of their product.  I never opened the product; therefore they stated that they will accept a return.  But, the outcome is yet to be determined. Beware of this company&#x27;s free samples.</li>
    <li> I placed m  order for my &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; and while Iunderstand the shipping chaarge, which was nominal, the $189.00 came as quiite a shock.&lt;br /&gt;I callled them IMMEDIATELY (same day the charge aaappeared) the recording promised it wasd just a precaution, and would be removed, s it &amp;#34;was just a precaution against fraudulent charges and would be removed shortly&amp;#34;..never happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I placed my order weeks ago,,and whil I only received it this Tuesday, I was billed an additional $189.00 by the frollowing Saturday (4 days later). I was told the 30 days begins when you place your ordoer. This way they can wait 3 weeks to ship your order and then chaarge you within 4 days of receiving the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve called 4 times in the last 2 hours and put on hold for over 20 minutes each time when I ask to speak with a supervisor. NO LUCK SO FAR WIL UPDATE.</li>
    <li> The free sample is a lie, they charge you about $200.00 for a cream that does nothing for your skin, a cheap cream from the drugstore is more efficient.</li>
    <li> I just gotta tell the truth now! This skin care product is nothing less than awesome. Naturally everyone of us have a different skin care need. I was reluctant to try life cell simply because I hate creams on my face. I assume it would be oily and who wants oily skin at night and on your pillowcase? But this skin care is different! It goes on smooth, (not at all oily) pores are diminished, wrinkles are less visible, and the skin is lifted via consistency a regimen. Listen up, ladies: It does not (miraculously) lift the skin, this happens as you apply your own regimen technique. I should know I tried it. This is my concern, however, the cost. If the skin care product was produced for celebrities, than sell it to celebrities alone, and do not advertise it to the public. I believe South Beach should make life cell readily available to all consumers, this includes people who are unable to purchase it @ $189.00. At least market it in a way where the overall public may want to purchase it always. Needless to say celebrities have their own methods and skin care regimens-creams, lotions, serums (surgeons) (YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN). Still it is an A-list product where I am concerned.</li>
    <li> Great product I have used several other products but this one is worth the price I return to it because it really work.</li>
    <li> Best skin product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It works well for me.  Non greasy and non glossy. Will be using it for a very long time!</li>
    <li> sorry, but save your money. i ended up buying lotus vit a cream and it did in two days what this product didn&#x27;t do in 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> If you buy anything from LifeCell, they will repeatedly charge your credit card hundreds of dollars.  DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS LIFECELL.</li>
    <li> I have been using it four weeks now and it definately helps with puffiness under eyes.  I haven&#x27;t noticed it improving a lot of other areas but I think overall it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  I am hoping I will notice more fine line reduction in the near future, but to be honest, I never notice a lot of improvement from products.  Overall I like this one.</li>
    <li> I went to place the order for the introductory cost of $4.25 with the thought, if it doesn&#x27;t work, I will return it. Well my order didn&#x27;t even go through - you know why??? Because i had less than the $189. They were attempting to deduct the full amount, not just the $4.25. Ladies, DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT. For $200, you can get far better quality creams. Do not give this company your card number. I am so thankful that it didn&#x27;t go through. Afterwards, I decided to check out the reviews. When I entered Lifecell in the search box, the words scam came up - thats never a good thing!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Do I like the price? No. Did I appreciate the pre-authorization that they actually deducted from my account? Hell no. They better get their act together, and just get rid of the whole trial deal. People try the deals to save money, who are on a tight budget. The pre-authorization left me with a negative balance. Thankfully nothing was over-drawn, but I was at a store and declined for my purchase. I keep most of my money in savings to avoid things exactly like this. My rating is an average. 5 for happy with the product, love how soft my skin is. 1 or 2 for crappy policy for billing.</li>
    <li> I have not bought the product but a company that requires to develop review websites with fake reviews can&#x27;t be trusted. After further reading the reviews of actual customers this product is highly questionable. My recommendation to all: DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Huge Ripoff! Very expensive &amp;#34;free&amp;#34;sample. Lots of hassles with both Life Cell and my credit card company ensure that the 189$ american would not continue to be charged to my account.  Too bad you have to give even one star to post the comment!</li>
    <li> After accepting the &#x27;free trial&#x27; and paying just for the shipping charge, they immediately charge my account for $189.  I called to ask them why they charged me for the free trial and was told they did not charge me - said something about putting a hold on the money if after the trial I want to purchase the product.  After a couple of weeks of trying the product, with none of the fabulous results promised, I call to cancel the order.  The very next day, I was charged $189!!  I called customer service and was told since I did not send the product back, I was charged.  The person on the phone did not tell me I had to return the product and even if I knew to return it, they did not give me time to send it back and charged my account the very next day.  This is a rip off - product was no better than any drug store product and they have are scamming you out of money.  I hope you read this before you accept a free trial!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply did not work for me, wasted money. I use the old ones I always use It works better.</li>
    <li> I do not know what I would do without this lifesaving cream! After spending time and money with products which simply do not work. I finally found a cream that does what I need it to. I was having a hard time finding something that would help with the firmness of my skin... especially on my face where it counts most. However, after using Lifecell for roughly 2 weeks I see a drastic difference! even underneath my chin! My skin feels firmer and smoother... I am in love! I highly recommend everyone to try this cream! What do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> Not onldy did the product not work for me, the company is also fraudulent.  When I called then before the trial period that the product did not work and would like to return it, they said I should use it till the end of the following month, and if possible finish using it since it takes about 6 weeks to see the effect.  But unbeknownst to me they had deducted $189 from my account even before the trial extension was over.  And they refused to refund my money.  $189 for a lousy product is a rip off, and they know how to stick it to you.  Your best bet is not to go near this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYERS BEWARE</li>
    <li> benefits do NOT justify the cost.  lots of hot air for no reward or improvement.  who knew products made these kinds of promises?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care how good the product is. When I see that Life Cell Skincare uses the old trick of pay only $4.25 and get charged the full $189, I can see what kind of people are running the show. Please read the terms and conditions before you provide your credit card information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> The advertising made me really want to try this product. It was so expensive, I thought it must be very good. I was wrong. This cream works exactly the same as the stuff I buy at Walmart for five dollars or so. Do NOT believe the hype and testimonials. Save your money, or go buy 40 bottles at your local variety store.</li>
    <li> I really like it and I think my face looks much more hydrated and smoother.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my skin. I love the way is has my face looking and feeling. It has really help with my dark circles and crows feet. It has even reduced the wrinkles that I have (had) around my lips. My husband has seen so much improvement with my facial skin that he started to use the LifeCell anti-aging cream. I am really happy that I finally found something that works for wrinkles, crows feet, and dark circles. Just wanted to share how happy I am with the anti-aging cream.</li>
    <li> I had great hopes for this product but am sadly disappointed.  After using Lifecell my skin feels uncomfortably dry and has lost its young, fresh look.  My foundation goes on over this cream with a matte finish, adding to the dry, older appearance.  I will be returning the product.</li>
    <li> Did not get the results I beloved from the advertisement that I would achieve by using the product, so am very disappointed with no results.</li>
    <li> I like very much…expensive...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the negative reviews - this product works very well for me.  I have been using the product for over 6 months and my skin looks wonderful.  I have used a bit of this product on both of my granddaughters (both teens) when they are visiting and have break out trouble - by the next morning, their skin has improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one comment I would make on the application is - you only use a very small amount.  You have to warm it up on your fingertips and your face should be moistened with fairly warm water.  When I first recieved the product, I had a tendency to over apply it, and that did cause a minor breakout.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be just another product which was a waste of money. The ingredients did not seem to have any real dermatological benefit. Nevertheless, after the first application I was hooked. I am able to use it sparingly and get a wonderful and fresh look around my eyes and lips. Caution though. If you order directly from the company and get the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; sample, they put you on a monthly re-order system. I had to call to be sure Not to have it charged to my credit card. Read the fine print. The company will then give you a break on the price for subsequent purchases. I just went to Amazon as I found no way to make the online purchase without doing the sample order again. Guess you have to phone. Worth every penny. Plan to keep it in my purse for touch ups.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product-the terms and conditions relating to this product are 7 pages of A4. Before you receive this product the so-called trial, hundreds of £ which you did not authorise are pre-authorised from your bank and show up as a debit ($189.00 for product plus shipping cost) and taken out of your account. If you have a query following your so-called order, there is a reference number they give you, but the actual order does not describe nor specify exactly what you allegedly ordered nor that your account will be deducted i.e. shipping costs plus $189.00. If you have a query, you are advised to contact support@lifecellskin.com which does not work: your email just bounces back. To cancel go on the Lifecell website (For some reason the web address will not print here)&lt;br /&gt;Look at the terms and conditions-this tells you the real story.&lt;br /&gt;Go on the website and find the area which allows you to \\&quot;chat\\&quot; to a customer service adviser-make sure you get all this in writing before the 30 day period. Tell the officer to cancel your order-if you do not do this, you are liable to receive the same order every 60 days with vast amounts of cash leaving your account. Legally this company is subject to the Unfair Contracts Terms Act 1977 since their contractual terms amount to a misrepresentation. Yahoo originally advertised this company to me and should take some responsibility to check their contractual terms of trading with customers is not misleading, thereby invalidating any contract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bank has classified this as a fraud-Trading Standards has also been contacted-I shall be contacting my local MP and urge you to do the same-this is all about very sharp annexing of your account to authorise £££££ leaving your account before you have had a chance to read the 7 pages of A4 Terms and Conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been advised by Lifecellskin that a refund has been authorised but to be safe, my bank has cancelled my bank card and urged me to change my password so that this company cannot take any more so-called pre-authorised amounts of money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;Sheilasword so that this company cannot take any more so-called pre-authorised amounts of money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps&lt;br /&gt;Sheila</li>
    <li> I ordered Lifecell online and received the trial tube of the cream.  I must admit spending $180 on a topical cream was a steep jump but in the end I was pleased and continuing my membership.  Around 10yrs ago I found out I had Melasma.  Large dark pigmentation spots around both my eyes and upper cheeks.  I thought I wasn&#x27;t using enough sun block for the longest time but realized just coating the dark spots with sun block did nothing to even out my skin color.  My doctor suggested the increasingly large spots were probably due to a change in the levels of hormones my 40yr old body was producing (that was scary- for a guy).  I got a prescription for a topical but was frustrated after not seeing results quick enough and stopped using it at $160 a tube.  I was supposed to use that and keep out of the sun.  So for 10 years I tried everything to keep the sun off of my face but the spots continued getting darker and darker and spreading larger across my face.  I looked like a racoon.  Nothing I tried could stop the spots but recently I got Lifecell.  I have been using the product 2 1/2 months and I&#x27;ve realized a 50% lightening of my 10 year old dark spots!!!  For my second shipment they sent a complimentary tube of their undereye treatment and I got to admit that undereye topical is doing just what SouthBeach claims..in short their product is a fine one in my opinion and to me personally is worth the price.  Lifecell does not claim to reverse wrinkles and spots overnight-  I think the word from the company is that it takes 160 days to see really significant changes in the skin.  I&#x27;ve seen changes however after almost 90 days what had been a 10 year problem with no relief in sight barring surgery-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed, A Believer</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I got the trial product because I was very curious and eager to see amazing things happen to my skin.  I&#x27;m only 29 and wrinkles have yet to become a problem, but I&#x27;m all for early intervention and want to keep my skin in good condition now to prevent worse things happening in the future.  I&#x27;d been searching for eye creams after trying some Burt&#x27;s Bees products and came across this.  Thank goodness for the trial offer, is all I can say.  I actually had a very easy and positive experience with the return process.  At the 30 day point I saw that my charge of $189 was still pending but the return package was in the mail, and when it was received the charge was taken away, so I was pleased with that end of things.  As for the effectiveness of the product, I&#x27;m still up in the air.  I squeezed out the unused portion to continue to use, since the company had stated that sometimes it takes up to six weeks to see results, so I&#x27;m still using it in the hope that maybe I&#x27;ll see some changes.  Admittedly, my skin does feel and look a little nicer, but that could be due to one of many factors - diet, stress, sleep - who knows?  I&#x27;ve read far too many negative reviews about this stuff to feel like it&#x27;s doing me any favors, so I think I&#x27;ll finish up what I have and move on to a different, more plant-based formula for my skin (I don&#x27;t feel really comfortable putting all of these complex chemicals on my face).  I hope others have better luck with LifeCell!</li>
    <li> Yes I also did this offer and instead of being billed 4.95 they charged me $189.  My husband wasn&#x27;t checking the credit card regularly and a month later another box appeared and another payment!!!!!  So far they have credited me the second price but we will see about the first $189.00.  Don&#x27;t give them your credit card.</li>
    <li> My wife took up the 30 day free trial offer. She paid for shipping and tried the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did not like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 1 star is that Lifecell charged her $189 without her consent and without her ordering the full product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to our CC company not a big problem, but the methods of Lifecell are unethical and typical for scammers.</li>
    <li> i was also looking forward to trying something for wrinkles. The only reason why i gave 2 stars was because all it did for me was moisturize. :(</li>
    <li> Ladies (and gents),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old saying if it&#x27;s too good to be true.... you know the rest.  I saw they were offering this free trial sized \\&quot;miracle cream\\&quot; (health and beauty site) and you only had to pay $4.25 for shipping. Yeah right!  I am here to confirm what others are saying here in reviews.  I only wish I had visited my trusty Amazon FIRST (which I normally do) before I signed up for this \\&quot;alleged free trial size cream\\&quot;.  I could just kick myself.  When I saw the reviews from other consumers, I quickly went to check my bank account and yep! sure enough, these people charged my account the $4.25 AND $189.00 just like the others. It is \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to be a pending charge that stays on your account  for a few days and \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to disappear from your account.  The only disappearing act here are dollars! And Goodness to Betsy if you miss that 30 day window for whatever reason, inclusive of not being able to get in touch with a LifeCell company rep, well then my friend, you are pretty much S.O.L.  I am currently in dispute with my bank and this company trying to get my precious dollars back in my account where they belong. Again, and \\&quot;supposedly\\&quot;, the \\&quot;trick\\&quot; (terms and conditions/fine print.. which by the way, is ONLY on their website and not on the other numerous health and beauty websites touting their product; if it were, many of us would have been forewarned of their practices) nonetheless, the \\&quot;trick\\&quot; is to cancel the product within 30 days of you taking advantage of their \\&quot;free trial\\&quot;, otherwise they will charge you and keep sending the product and keep charging you! That&#x27;s all fine and dandy but you would actually have to get in touch with someone first in order to cancel. Good luck with that one!  As for me, I nor the bank representative have yet been able to reach a LifeCell representative. Luckily there are processes for these types of practitioners. These people must work somewhere in the land of magical clouds cause I have seen other reviewers say the same thing I am experiencing. I feel so violated. At this point it doesn&#x27;t matter if it is a miracle cream or not!  Why would we consumers want to do business with a company who employs unethical practices, tries to scam potential customers and steal from them!!! Other reviewers have stated that the cream doesn&#x27;t even work! I am even more skeptical about the 5 star reviews here as well. Normally I am not a cynical skeptic but this time I am.  And if you are even considering purchasing this product, do yourself a favor and just click past this product-even the most savvy shopper can be sucked in.  This is what they seem to bank on.  Just save yourself time, hassle and the headaches that comes along with the so called \\&quot;Free Trial\\&quot; and/or $189 purchase (same thing) and just run!.....Run Now!the same thing I am experiencing.

    <li> I&#x27;ll give one start to this product because I was unable to purchased it with a pre-paid card. The only way I can submit this review is by&lt;br /&gt;choosing two stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this through the South Beach Skincare website after looking up what I could on it and reading a number of reviews.  I am on day 26 of using it.  I say don&#x27;t expect miracles, because it does not do anything for wrinkles.  As I tell others, the only thing that will &#x27;cure&#x27; wrinkles is surgery.  However!...this product has made a difference in the allover appearance of my skin.  Even at 49 years old, I suffer from very oily skin and serious acne.  Not only did this product NOT make my skin break-out, but it has helped to alleviate the acne and my skin is not near the oiliness it was (I also use Clearskin Tinted Adult Treatment Cream over this).  AND, my skin is definitely much more even to the point where I do not have to use as much make-up as I had been using to cover the splotches, redness, acne areas, and/or spots.  I am impressed with it enough that I will continue on with it (for now), but through the South Beach skincare website because once you sign up with the first purchase, you receive future shipments at a lower price AND you can change the delivery schedule.</li>
    <li> I ordered a trial of Life Cell face Cream directly from the company.  You were only to be charged shipping and then after 30 days be charged the $189.00. If I did not like it I was supposed to be able to cancel before the 30 days so I would not be charged the $189.00.  Life Cell put a pre-authorization hold of $189.00 on my checking account!  They DID NOT remove the pre-authorization therefore they took $189.00 out of my checking account!  This caused me to have 4 charges overdraw on my account (and the fees)!  Being right after Christmas, I did not have a surplus of funds in my account.  (My bank said, even if they do not cancel the pre-auth/hold, it stays on my account for 10 days.  PLUS - I have overdraft fees now on 4 items!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please WARN consumers of this!  Life Cell WILL take the $189.00 out of your account!  Even after numerous phone calls to them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are ordering from Amazon, then you are expecting the charge to be taken out right away......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
    <li> I would have no problem if this product worked, no matter what kind of sales tactic they use. I have tried LifeCell for over one year, patiently hoping one day it would start to work. It never did. I was just naive to believe that the reviews I read online were written by genuine customers. Recently I ran into another website that looked like neutral third party skin product reviews on Yahoo. It had LifeCell as the number one skin product. I decided to write my experience with it. Guess what? It got deleted. After a little digging, I found that the website doesn&#x27;t belong to a third party. It was just another LifeCell company&#x27;s sales tactic. They run many websites, which look like unbiased skin product reviews. The only negative thing they would say about LifeCell is its price (because they feel that they should say something negative, otherwise it would be too obvious that it is just their advertisement). But really is $190 too much if it really works the way they advertise it? Please don&#x27;t be a victim of their lies. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money.</li>
    <li> what a difference it makes on ones face, it evens out the complexion quite lovely. Top of the line product.</li>
    <li> Yahoo news website advertised about this product and there were many good reviews. They said that I will be only charged for shipping for a free trial. After few days I received a package. When I open the box, I was surprised with the bottle size. The bottle was kind of too big for as a free sample. After few days, I saw $179 pending charge on my credit card. I thought that it was a mistake. I called them up. They said that they are going to charge this amount after a month. I told them that I was never aware of this amount and I didn&#x27;t give them approval to charge me. The representative said that there is a line about this billing before submit the order. I questioned her why didn&#x27;t the company tell me up front. This is kind of deceiving customers. Suppose this product is really good, I wouldn&#x27;t do business with this kind of company. I applied it around my eye area and I didn&#x27;t see the difference before and now. I am going to return it. Yahoo must be so desperate to make money by putting this kind of advertisement on it&#x27;s website. I got this because I was trusted yahoo website. Shame on them!</li>
    <li> it did not performed well on my skin. it actually got it drier and less lucious.&lt;br /&gt;really bad product. never again.</li>
    <li> You guys have to realize that when it comes to these products theres a lot of fakes buy from manufacturer .</li>
    <li> I was seriously considering this cream for my fine lines, but reading the product description turned me off immediately! First of all, the fact that it can \\&quot;penetrate 20 layers of skin\\&quot; isn&#x27;t all that impressive; EVERYONE knows that you have to go at least 23-37 layers deep to effectively neutralize the microscopic mole people who are responsible for breaking down your collagen and elastin on a molecular level in order to build their majestic mole-cities. And \\&quot;25,000 micro-lifters\\&quot;? Puh-lease. Serious beauty cream connoisseurs know that you want a cream with a 900,000 micro/24,967 macro-lifter ratio. Without that, the product does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the prevention of \\&quot;lip bleeding\\&quot; intrigues me, I&#x27;m holding out until they lower the price; my carmex does this job just fine, thank-you-very-much, and I can get it for $1.69 at the drug store.</li>
    <li> Every since i can remember i have always had the worst skin no matter how much I took care of my face. I have spent most of my younger years trying to cover and hide all of my flaws. Let&#x27;s just say that the makeup industry must love me. One day one of my good friends told me about this product. I tried the product and at first i was a little discouraged because i didn&#x27;t see dramatic over night results. My friend told me to just continue using that product twice a day. About a month and a half later i just couldn&#x27;t believe how awesome my skin looked. This product has really given me a boost of confidence for sure. i have been using the product for 5 months now and its one of the best things that i have ever come across. Really happy about the change that LifeCell has made to my life. I had everything from horrible scars, discoloration, a few lines forming on the side of my eyes.. Now my lines are gone and the discoloration is minimal. also some of my scars have disappeared. This product has unleashed the confidence in me that i never knew i had. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotta say, I&#x27;ve used a ton of skincare products in my life, and so far they&#x27;ve all been a waste of time and money. They didn&#x27;t work as advertised, or the time it took to show a difference was horrendous! I got this baby as a late birthday present one year, and I wasn&#x27;t that excited at first. I thought it was going to be the same old cycle again; some expensive product that wouldn&#x27;t work and would sink a hole in wallets. But let me tell you, I have never been more wrong in my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing and works as a great present! I&#x27;ve been smoking for years, and yet my skin is now retaining an elasticity that could compete with any younger person now! I look great, I feel great, and I definitely plan to purchase this product again in the near future! I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference. I might try one more tube.</li>
    <li> I read some very positive reviews about this product, and on some sites it was rated Number One in fighting wrinkles and aging skin.  I assumed after the good ratings and reiviews I had read that the cost was justified because this one really works!  I&#x27;d happily spend that much on such a product if the product performed as promised.  I do not see any change at all, and I&#x27;ve used it faithfully, twice a day, for over a month.  You&#x27;d think there would be something out there that really works.  All I know is this is not the one.  Don&#x27;t do like I did and fall into the \\&quot;if it&#x27;s this expensive it must work\\&quot; trap.</li>
    <li> lifecell is really amazing! hopefully the price will come down because I cant afford this stuff forever . it is expensive...................</li>
    <li> I too ordered what I believed to be a \\&quot;free sample\\&quot; from \\&quot;lifecell\\&quot; and would just like to emphasize that the it is NOT FREE.  They will charge you the full amount of the product which is $189.00 if you do not return the product to them within 30 days.  The product did not provide the anti-aging benefits that I was expecting, but more importantly I feel I was misled by the company.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order from these people.  For the trial offer for $4.95 they will also debit your account for $189.00 to make sure you have the money in case you don&#x27;t like the trial....you cannot get anyone on the phone, if you email them all you get is blah, blah, blah.  They did this to me this past Friday, it is Tuesday and the money is still not back in my account.  The $4.95 is, but not the $189.00.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this product if it made me look 20 years younger at this point.</li>
    <li> I ordered lifecell like everyone else thinking it is going to be great, I guess if you have had a face lift like all the movie starts it works wonders, I am 65 very fair complexion (freckles) did nothing to tighten my skin. No worth the money in my opinion. Might work with your younger, if you have loose skin doesnt do anything to tighten it up or erase wrinkles, so that picture of the 87 yr lady is false she had a full face lift for sure.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to trying this product. I was convinced after reading everything about it that it was the solution to fighting wrinkles. I ordered online from the website and was told it was back-ordered but would ship in ten days. One month later I had to call to tell them that I had still not received the product. They apologized and I received it in a week. I was so convinced I would have dramatic results that I took \\&quot;before\\&quot; pictures. I faithfully applied the cream twice a day every day, but I saw no changes. I even tried just doing one side of my face so I could compare the two...no difference. The write ups say that there may be a tingling feeling and a tightening feeling, but I didn&#x27;t feel either. I wish I had, then at least I would have felt like it was doing something. As time went on I used a little bit more each time (to try to get some result), but you can only put on so much before your skin takes on a yellowish cast...not good. The worst part was that when I got down to the last bit of the cream my husband asked, \\&quot;Whatever happened with that new wrinkle cream you were so excited about, is it still back-ordered?\\&quot; Not exactly a rousing endorsement. I am only in my mid-thirties. The wrinkles I have are fairly shallow, but visible. If this didn&#x27;t work for me I&#x27;m not sure how it could work for an older person who is trying to combat wrinkles that have been around for awhile. I hope this review helps someone in their decision making process. I wish I had read a review like this before I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I have never used a cream that works on all areas of my face. But this cream hydrates and moisturizes and leaves my skin so soft and light... I was not sold in the beginning because I have very sensitive skin. But I decided to take a chance on LifeCell and the first night I used this cream my face felt so soft and smooth. That I wanted continue using this cream when I got up the next day to get ready for work I used the cleanser (which is amazing by the way) to wash my face, then I applied the Lifecell cream after. When I got to work my co worker asked me was I wearing Makeup.. this made me feel so good inside that I continued to use the LifeCell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this cream for about 3 months now and I must say I have eliminated 5 products off of my dresser and replaced them all with 1 product the Lifecell all-in-one cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read some of the reviews that says SCAM and FREE and I laugh and ask myself How could a company give away FREE stuff and never go out of business? I think people need to take responsibility for their own actions and read the fine print before giving anyone their personal and credit card information. Would you go to Macy&#x27;s and take their products home without paying for them?</li>
    <li> Incredible!! Used the LifeCell for a full 60 days and it worked like a charm! Didn&#x27;t see real changes until the 6th week, and now my skin is firm and the crows feet are gone!!! Love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. All my friends noticed the difference. Very very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am a total product junkie so when I saw this trial I thought why not? The first application did exactly what was described so I was immediately pleased -my wrinkles were hardly noticeable. I&#x27;m 3 weeks in at this point and my favorite aspect is the extreme difference it makes with the puffiness around my eyes. I&#x27;m 41 and get puffy around the eyes if I even look at salt! I use it in the am and pm and aso use it on my upper eyelids too. I have a lot of sun damage and it has definitely lessened the redness and pigmentation issues. I will warn to use sparingly under make up as it seems to look a bit cake if you aren&#x27;t careful. However without makeup, I feel more of a brightness with my skin. They say it takes about 4-8 weeks for the &amp;#34;aha&amp;#34; reaction so I&#x27;m hoping for continuous improvement. I hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!This is a scam! I ordered the free trial and was supposed to be charged $9.25 to pay for shipping. I recieved an alert from my bank moments later that I was charged $189.00. Now I feel I should request a new debit card so they cannot charge any revolving fees.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews on products I have purchased but this cream is so amazing I felt the need to share my experience .. I have been using LifeCell for over 5 months now and each day I wake up with improvements to my skin  I have tried several &amp;#34;firming anti aging&amp;#34; products, but am most impressed with this firming cream. It has a slight &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; feel, and at the same time, feels hydrating Also this is a great product if you have age spots and/or dark spots it evened out my skin tone in the matter of weeks !</li>
    <li> After reading some if these reviews ..at first i was a little discourage to try out the product ..but in most cases of reviews for any company usually the bad ones are from customers that are mad and even if a product is good they will tell you it was the worst thing so then I decided to take the risk .i have been using it for 3 months now and I absolutely love it.i feel like it has taken a few years off me I feel so&lt;br /&gt;Much younger and my husband has also been using it ,he is 74 and I&#x27;m 62 it has done wonders for him the sagging under his neck is not so noticeable since it helps you tighten your skin ,he also had a lot of acne scaring and if you see him now you wouldn&#x27;t belive he ever had that issue ,on my self I had frown wrinkles and I like to call them smoker wrinkles on the side of your lips I&#x27;m just amazed in how I can barely see them ..what&#x27;s even more great is the helpfulness of the customer sevice and when you become a member the gifts they send you are great ..so I can say I&#x27;ve become a loyal happy customer .</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product like this for years! I&#x27;ve been through every name brand possible and I basically spent too money to fill up my cabinets with so many products. &lt;br /&gt;I am an on the Go person who lives a busy life and this product is prefect for the type of life style I have. It&#x27;s all in one. It&#x27;s literally done miracles for me, I can never go back to any other products. I started seeing results in just 3 weeks!! I&#x27;m so in love. No more puffiness. No more wrinkles and don&#x27;t let me get started on my dark spots. I RECOMMEND this product to every single person. </li>
    <li> I have been using the cream for about 5 months now and love it! Was skeptical at first but after just a couple weeks of using people started noticing a change (Make sure to read trial terms to understand how it works) I was especially happy once I calculated the cost of using this vs all my previous creams on average I&#x27;m saving about $20a month! Especially love using it with the face wash. Will def continue my autorefills for more cream, being 62 is not easy!</li>
    <li> You should order this product from dermatologistrx.com. They always have discounts so you will definitely get it for less than $189. You are also not obligated to keep receiving the product.  You can order it when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very nice to be using one product with good results instead of 3 or 4 different ones!</li>
    <li> I am much over 50. Take a before and after photo, they say. Just a few seconds and you will be amazed. Be sure and read the part where the disappearance of your wrinkles is an optical illusion. Do not bother with this product unless you are in your 30&#x27;s. Maybe you will see something then. this product is overpriced and works no better than Olay or Aveeno.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that is doesn&#x27;t tighten mt skin so I still have baggy jowls. It has filled in so that some of my wrinkles are gone</li>
    <li> Product does not work, very rude customer service agents upon cancelling your 2nd order and account. Extra charges on credit card even after cancelling your order! A waste of hard-earned money!!! Don&#x27;t be a victim....</li>
    <li> It is not the miracle it is cracked up to be, but it does leave the skin soft and fresher looking for a time.</li>
    <li> The cream left my skin dry in the morning and, after three weeks I stopped using it. I did not return the unused portion. Several weeks later I received a box from them and saw that my credit card had been charged $189.00. By the time I reached them by phone I was told I had to call back during the week as there was no one available during the weekend. When I finally reached someone, I was told that I was automatically enrolled in their program. I could not return the unopened box unless it reached them the very next day and, if I did return it, they would just mail it back to me. I am returning the box as refused anyway and will dispute the charge with my credit company. Buyer Beware!</li>
    <li> This is just an ordinary cream.  It&#x27;s there, but does not perform miracles.  For the cost one would expect at least one miracle.  Buy Clinique.  It&#x27;s just as good, and you get to choose when you get it.  Folks, check the trial offer carefully.  You get to try it for 30 days.  Best you send some back if you do not like it.  They will charge you $149 for this.  It is a 60 day supply they send.  You do not get anything free.  Before I finally came to my senses, this has cost $383.  Beware. Caroline from Oregon</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with an interest in giving it a try. I&#x27;m 68, not all that wrinkled, but I want to be as pro-active about my appearance as possible. I was brought up to use moisturizers as a \\&quot;beauty secret\\&quot;, so I have experience with them. This product is nothing special. You can get the same thing from Olay&#x27;s line of products for a more reasonable price. Dr. Perricone&#x27;s products and his advice are expensive but excellent. In fact, you can get wonderful results with substantial skin softening by applying fruit directly to your skin (it&#x27;s messier than a processed cream). Life Cell Cream is a nice enough moisturizer, but others work as well for less money. What you get with Life Cell Cream is a medium-smallish tube for $189. I used part of it, canceled further shipments and sent about half the tube back. As I was outside of their trial period, they insisted on charging me anyway; a high price to pay for part of a trial offer. Beware.</li>
    <li> I tried this product, and feel like just about everyone does on Amazon&#x27;s web site. I hope that I don&#x27;t have the same problem with this billing issue when I return it. I also tried to leave a so called &amp;#34; Unbiased review &amp;#34;on LifeCell web site. But they did not post it, I tried it again, still they did not post. There are only 23 reviews on that site, and it is all positive results. That so called &amp;#34;17 second miracle&amp;#34; is just a way to get you to try it, and no one saw a 17 sec. skin change on the reviews. I think that the customers are just having a placebo effect due to all of the positive results on the site. I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon accepts comments, both positive, and negative. From now on, I&#x27;m  ALWAYS going to check Amazon reviews before I purchase anything.of value. I always need to remember, &amp;#34;If it sounds to good to be true&amp;#34;, well we all know the answer to that. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR ALLOWING US TO WRITE A REVIEW THAT MATTERS, NOT ONLY TO MYSELF, BUT OTHERS AS WELL!</li>
    <li> I use this nightly -for almost 3 months. After a good wash with Estee Lauder&#x27;s pink Soft Wash (gets all the makeup off) I can honestly report fine lines around my eyes almost gone. Scar on my forehead since I was 25-almost gone. Lines above my lips-gone!! Texture is very rich and thick- but melts into the skin rather quickly leaving a nice flow - not a grandma cold cream nightmare!! Yes, it&#x27;s hideously expensive! But wow, it&#x27;s sooooo nice to wakeup and not look like a greaseball :)</li>
    <li> Pretty good cream, I actually did notice a difference with the lines on my face, especially around my eyes. I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered a $4 &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; sized of this product in December of 2013.  My debit account had been billed 2 separate charges from Lifecell.  One amount was for the $4 and s and h.  The other amount was for a full size product in the amount of $189.  The $189 was later refunded to my account.  I called immediately to cancel any further shipments because of the cost.  30 days later I was billed $189.  When I called Lifecell about this, they informed me that they do not send out trial size versions of the face cream.  Instead, they send a full size product and if you do no return it within 30 days they bill you for the full size product.</li>
    <li> This cream sounded too good to be true.  I am a 68-year-old attorney who should have known better.  Even I was fooled by the clever wording of the &amp;#34;Free Trial.&amp;#34;  I didn&#x27;t like the product, and I returned it UPS ground tracking within 7 days of ordering it. Thank God I used my American Express credit card and was only charged $4.25 for shipping. My cover letter with the return said I was canceling, see the properly filled out return form and any further charges to my American Express card will be disputed and not paid.  Do not use a Debit Card to order items online.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do what we thought it was suppose to do!  We will try a differs product and try to get the result we are looking for.</li>
    <li> Lifecell is a scam, beware of it. First I saw it  online and wanted to try the free offer as advertised by them. They were supposed to charge only shipping and handling for $ 4.30 cents. But they charged $189 to my credit card . When I called the number  it goes to cruise company. Beware of thevscam</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product a couple of months ago by a close friend and I must say that at first I was skeptical to try it but I&#x27;m SO glad I did. I&#x27;ve been searching for an effective all in one treatment for years now, and after just one month I&#x27;ve began to see drastic changes in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having combination skin can make it a bit difficult to find a product that actually works, but LifeCell&#x27;s got the right amount of moisturizer I need. The texture feels wonderful - it&#x27;s silky, smooth, and when initially slathering it on my face, it feels luxurious. I&#x27;m a fan of creams that go on very light as I am usually out all day and a heavier based cream is just not suitable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually don&#x27;t take the time to review products but this one absolutely deserves it. It&#x27;s the first time in years that I find something I am so satisfied with.</li>
    <li> This product is good for the soft lines but doesn&#x27;t do that great a job for undereye puffiness and dark circles. It lasts long though.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to receive my \\&quot;free\\&quot; trial however, after using it for almost a month I can tell you that I get better results from my £2 moisturiser. I didn&#x27;t mind as it was only a trial and only paid for the delivery of the product. However I have woke up this morning to find that cell cream have taken £128.28 from my back!!! For what I do not know!!! I have has no contact from them to inform me that this was happening. Raging is not the word!!! It&#x27;s disgusting that these companies get away with robbing people of their money without any information of it on their website... Total joke. The company is a disgrace, do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive and dies not fully do all that they promised. A competitor, Hydroxatone is far less pricey snd does the total job properly. Also Lifecell does not last long. It is not an effective primer, does not tighten under eye bags and doesn&#x27;t feel like it moisturizers. I&#x27;m 46 years old. I deserve better for that kind of money.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and at night before bed. I love it. It&#x27;s overpriced, as most things are, but i love it. I use it mixed with a tiny bit of warm water. It has helped clear up my Melasma., it&#x27;s not gone, but it&#x27;s much lighter than it was. I really like this product.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no question that right before my eyes this cream worked - very impressive. However, within two hours I had the most awful rash all over my face and it remained for more than 24 hours so would recommend testing a small area.</li>
    <li> I am so sorry that I fell for the free trial rubbish. Have been charged over 200 AUD and trying to get a refund. this is the only site that actually allows criticism of this product. I posted my complaint on their FB page and it was removed within a few hours, same with other posts that are not positive. The company spends an awful lot of time policing the internet...so many comments that sound exactly alike...hard to believe that they are real.</li>
    <li> This cream had fast results. I could see a difference within a few days of application. I am hooked! I am recommending this cream to all my friends &amp; co-workers.</li>
    <li> It sounded like something that was going to work. A waste of money. My skin is drier and there is no difference in my wrinkles.I am in my early 50&#x27;s and my skin looked better before I started using Lifecell.</li>
    <li> Not very pleased at all. I&#x27;m 44 with expression lines in my forehead. I thought I was supposed to be getting a sample to try before I love it and then place an order for a full size.  Well, I received a full size \\&quot;tube\\&quot; and charged for it, of course, (not the \\&quot;free sample, just pay for shipping\\&quot; like the ad said). After 4 weeks now, there is no change in the lines on my forehead. AND there was no shipping forms of any kind in the box, no return information at all. Would I recommend this product? No.  Could I have spent that $189 for something better? Yes. Will either go back to Botox or some other filler. Oh, and I don&#x27;t smoke or tan my face so my wrinkles are not caused from a poor lifestyle. I just wanted the lines to soften up but they didn&#x27;t; and I&#x27;m not comparing this product to Botox or any other filler. I didn&#x27;t expect Botox results but I did expect SOMETHING beneficial to happen because it was so expensive.</li>
    <li> I tried this product a month ago. It did not work. It is nothing but hype. It is also very expensive.The company uses 30 or 40 year old models who really look young to begin with. But if you&#x27;re 60+ and over, no amount of cream can change that sagging jowls and sagging neck. Save your money. Get a facelift instead, or just learn to live with wrinkles and saggs. After all, it is not so much as your exterior that counts but your good interior....</li>
    <li> I was excited to try out this cream.  I waited 4 weeks before writing this review and have not seen any change in my fine lines at all.  So I swapped to another product and even after 2 days I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my fine lines.  Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered a sample.  Got the large size.  Was billed 189.00.  I was shocked when I got my Amex bill.  When I trust a company with my credit card information I expect them to behave in a professional and trustworthy fashion.  I thought I was paying 4.00 in shipping costs not 189.00!!!!  For a lackluster product at that.</li>
    <li> this product has good reviews so i thought to try for myself.  it does not completely remove wrinkles, nor does it make your skin wrinkle free over time like the info sheet claims.  however, i have noted some slight improvement in my eye wrinkles, in that the wrinkles are less deep.  it seems to do better around the eyes vs the mouth lines.  i have been using this nightly for almost 6 weeks, and will continue to apply it until i use up the whole tube. then i will decide whether i should continue or not, depending on how my skin responds.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS THINKING FOR THE MONEY I WAS PAYING THAT IT WOULD WORK PLUS I READ SOME GREAT REVIEWS.  NOW I SEE THAT WHOEVER IS WRITING THOSE REVIEWS ARE IMAGINING THINGS.  IN USING THIS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS MY SKIN HAS AGED DRASTICALLY!!!  I HAVE DEEP LINES WHERE JUST AFEW MONTHS AGO I ONLY HAD FAINT LINES.  I HAVE TRIED TO RETURN IT BUT THEY SAID I CAN&#x27;T.  I DON&#x27;T NORMALLY WRITE REVIEWS AT ALL BUT I WANT TO SAVE SOMEONE ELSE&#x27;S MONEY FOR THEM.</li>
    <li> Was told I would receive this item for shipping only.  A charge then appeared on my credit card for $189.  This company is totally fraudulent.  It is a cream like any other.  Certainly not worth $189.  Very stupid of me to not investigate before clicking on the \\&quot;free\\&quot;-\\&quot;pay shipping only\\&quot; button.  Had to cancel my credit card to keep them from charging me further.</li>
    <li> My wife tried the free trial and she thought it would be just a free sample without any obligations. As it turned out it wasn&#x27;t. She used the product for a week and since she didn&#x27;t see any result she stopped using it. After a month she received a new tube in mail and she contacted the customer service. They said they have already charged her $189 for the first tube (free trial) and $149 for the second one. She immediately returned both tubes. The representatives contacted her and said they only return $189 and they are gonna keep $149 for themselves!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom-line: Lifecell is ineffective so they do all of the marketing/ legal tricks to bind you with a semi contract so that they could charge you no matter you use the product or not. Stay away from them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d call this a very drying moisturizer. Great, if you like the dried-up look.&lt;br /&gt;Also, their $7.95 free trial is for only a month, but they send you two months&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;worth....so, guess what....the 2nd month costs over $100.&lt;br /&gt;So, unless you love it, and want to be on their auto plan, better send it back before&lt;br /&gt;the first trial month is done.</li>
    <li> Idiotic waste of money.  They seem to spend all of their money on advertising, and nothing on their products.  Might as well use Crisco.  There are products that work, but this isn&#x27;t one of them!!!</li>
    <li> Yes yes Yes. I look 10years younger. I even gave one to my partner. Will DEFIANTLY recommend it. THANKS LIFECELL .</li>
    <li> I recently bought (free trial) a tube of Lifecell.  I had seen the rave reviews and at age 44, it sounded promising as I have lots of fine lines (and a couple deep wrinkles).  I applied some on half my face and a minute later, I could tell there was only a small improvement.  Later that day, after school, my 10 yo daughter said &amp;#34;Mommy, your face!&amp;#34;  I immediately jumped to the conclusion that I had gotten a rash or outbreak of pimples or something, because she really did looked shocked.  I said &amp;#34;What?&amp;#34; waiting for some deflating remark.  &amp;#34;Your forehead looks really good!&amp;#34;  I remembered I&#x27;d put on Lifecell that morning and hightailed it to the mirror.  It had worked WONDERS on my forehead, with only one application.  I am still shocked.  However, I will note that there was only a minimal improvement on the lower part of the apple of my cheeks, which is the only place besides my forehead with wrinkles.  At any rate, I&#x27;m hoping it will significantly help in that area pretty soon.  As for now I don&#x27;t intend on sending it back because I had shockingly good results on my forehead.</li>
    <li> They offered a great deal, a trial sample for only $4.25.  I should have know nothing could get the results they claimed.  It was just a scam to get my credit card number.  I got the sample. It was just a moisturizing cream, didn&#x27;t do anything to change my wrinkles and certainly not worth the full price.  Then  I discovered for two months they followed up with charges to my credit card for $189 each, which I did not authorize.  Furthermore, I didn&#x27;t even receive any product for these charges.  I am following up with my credit card company to remove these charges and now I will have to change my card number.  What a racket!</li>
    <li> Hello Lifecell is amazing after using this product I was asked if I had done something to my face and that motivated me to continue using the product even my best friend told me that my face looks to young for my character stile, I meet with a friend that I haven&#x27;t seen for 4 months and when she saw me she quick told me that I look great, I didn&#x27;t wanna share the secret but she&#x27;s a good friend and she needs it bad, I told her about Lifecell and she ordered the product the same day and called me a week after and told me that after two day&#x27;s of usage she saw a big difference on her wrinkle face and she thank me with tears.  I just wanna tell  everyone out there don&#x27;t believe the one star ratings most people rated the price and never got to try the product, I know it&#x27;s kinda expensive but it&#x27;s so worth it, $189 is not allot to look fabulous.  Thanks Lifecell you changed my life:) Anton</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Creams and pills are NOT the fountain of young we seek.  Look elsewhere to find what you like.</li>
    <li> I should have read other users&#x27; reviews earlier. Today I found this product&#x27;s Ad on Yahoo and like to try it out and went for trial. The page said it would charge only 4.5. Now it charged 189+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s never been  wiser to read genuine users comments before purchasing new products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and was initially excited to receive it. It was suppose to be a 30 day \\&quot;free trial.\\&quot; I was shocked when I checked my bank the next morning and found out the charges. $4.95 shippind (I expected) and the full $189.  I will cancel my card to prevent further charges.  I will not be using this product and canceled my order. I only wish I had read these reviews first!</li>
    <li> I ordered the 30 day trial offer and had to call them after not receiving anything for 2 weeks. They sent me another order and I finally received it and tried it for about 3 weeks. It did nothing for my skin, I could not see a difference at all. In fact my skin felt very dry after using it. They charged my bank account almost $200 when I called to tell them that I didn&#x27;t like it. I then had to call to send the trial offer bottle back with a letter telling them who I was and that I didn&#x27;t like it. It is a HUGE waste of time to even bother with dealing with them at all or trying this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s product is a scam. Free trial offer just pay shipping!!!!!  I give this product a big PU....&lt;br /&gt;I personally had better results with strivectin cream. Much more affordable too....&lt;br /&gt;I feel like its a scam. I saw no difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sry south beach sending the product back. I just hope I get my $$ back soon.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think there is full disclosure when ordering this product.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews at the Lifecell site and they all were 4/5 stars. I searched a few other sites/stories and those were also 4/5 stars. Now I am temped to buy the product but I thought, I wonder if this product is sold on amazon and here I am. Truthful reviews at last just 2 stars for 174 reviews UGH!! Any product that has more 1 stars then all the 5-4-3-2 stars combined is crap. Thank you amazon &amp; reviewers for saving me money.</li>
    <li> I would not buy it again nor would I recommended.  It is a very expensive product that does not live up to the expectations.</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it did do what promised but you have to use it continuosly. The product is very pricey and there isn&#x60;t that much for that amount.Should start using product late twenties to help.</li>
    <li> I ordered lifecell hoping it would help the wrinkles around my eyes.  I applied it faithfully morning and night excited to see results, nothing.  I decided to give it some time.  Not only did it not work, my eye lids and under my eyes got puffy and red.  Not wanting to believe it could possibly be this &amp;#34;amazing anti aging  wrinkle cream&amp;#34; I stopped using my other face products one at a time to try to find the problem.  Finally I decided to stop using Lifecell.  After 5 days my eyes finally looked almost back to normal.  I had already received my second shipment but didn&#x27;t open it while testing to see if Lifecell was the problem.  I returned lifecell unopened expecting to see some sort of refund.  No refund was issued.  After a couple months I called the company to find out why and was told I only had 15 days to try it so no refund would be sent.  It was confirmed the order was received back and no refund was to be sent.  The product was again offered to me, even after I had explained I am allergic to it, but no refund.  Finally a $54 dollar refund was offered which I accepted since it was either that or nothing!</li>
    <li> This product really works.  In minutes after using it all my wrinkles were gone!  Even the deepest ones on my forehead.  I was thinking of getting a facelift before using this product but Lifecell saved me that.  I don&#x27;t care about the price, it&#x27;s worth it to look 10 or so years younger.  I am 59 and look like I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s after using it just one day!  I highly recommend it to any woman who wants to gain back her youth.</li>
    <li> i ordered the trial for $1.25.  they billed me for $189.00.  make if you order the trial that you cancel within a month or they will charge you full price.  i&#x27;ve been using it for a month and really cannot see any difference at all.  definitely not worth $189.00.</li>
    <li> Amazon should take this off!&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly as bad as all these reviews say!&lt;br /&gt;Major bad!&lt;br /&gt;Rip off supreme!</li>
    <li> Everybody thinking of ordering this (or any of the other free beauty trials which are actually from the same seller) go to the bottom of the company&#x27;s web page and click on &amp;#34;Terms and Conditions&amp;#34; link to find out what the real terms are &amp; when they are going to start charging your credit card. (It&#x27;s a very long web page for a reason - they assume you will not read all of it.) By ordering &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; you are agreeing to the terms of the agreements from that link, which often means agreeing to pay full price for product if you do not return in a specified time &amp; way. You are also accepting that your credit card will be automatically charged for a new order every ## days. Check with Amazon seller to explain what his return policy is and if it is tied to the terms &amp; conditions of the maker&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> Four days into using this cream my face has broke out in painful large spots. It has also created dry patches around my nose. No difference to any lines etc. My skin did not feel moisturised at all. It did however calm down some red broken veins I had but as soon as I stopped using it they started looking more vivid again. Very disappointed especially as it cost a three figure sum. Will be sticking to my usual cheaper moisturiser which does what it says on the tin. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash ladies.</li>
    <li> I have been using life cell for almost a year and I love it. I find it very effective for tightening and toning, pore reduction and youthful glow. I use it once a day and I see an immediate effect. I only just started using it under my eyes and it is very effective in firming and reducing sagging and puffiness. I am 55 years old and I am told that I look 10 years younger than that all the time. I am disturbed to hear about all the difficulties canceling orders and unauthorized withdrawals by LifeCell. I am going to begin checking my credit card statement more carefully, but I am not going to stop using the product.</li>
    <li> Saw no change. BEWARE...if you do not cancel within 30 days you will be charged $168!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as per the girlfriends instructions.  She loves the product and Amazon&#x27;s pricing is excellent.  Whatever she&#x27;s doing must be working because she has amazing skin.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product and have seen positive results after several months of use. Yes, I recommend it. And it&#x27;s been my experience that one tube lasts longer than the manufacturer suggests.</li>
    <li> No stars! The cream does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;The company claims to send a free sample for just the shipping fees and then charges your credit card $189 without your knowing it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the price, i feel great this treatment.</li>
    <li> Expensive product, but after 6 months of using as directed there appears to be a noticeable improvement in my skin and elasticity.  I am on my 2nd tube.</li>
    <li> I have read all the scathing negative reviews and, personally, I am surprised.  I have been using this product for 3 years now, and I just love it.  I find the cream absorbs quickly and leaves my skin radiant.  I am 65 years young, and everyone asks how I do it.  Yes, I have good genes, but aging skin is aging skin.  My skin, after LifeCell, is plump and there are virtually NO wrinkles around my eyes!!!  This did better than Botox, Restylane and all the rest.  I used to wonder about a facelift, but this is a lot cheaper and painless.  Sorry about all the criticism, but not from me.  I will continue to order LifeCell happily!</li>
    <li> Check it out.  I fell for a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; tube of Life Cell and paid only shipping charge for first tube.  I received the tube.  BTW, the skin care product does nothing for your skin except perhaps damage to sensitive skins.  And they charged my VISA $189.00.  This company is nothing but a fraud.  DO NOT FALL FOR IT.  They should be arrested.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review before but this is such a fraudulent company I felt I owed it to hard-working good people to not get taken in by this. Please listen to all the other reviewers. I unfortunately did not read the reviews until I placed my order. I cancelled it within minutes after I read Amazon reviews. Once this deceptive company got my credit card, they debited $189.00 not once but twice, the other $189.00 a week later. They were probably hoping people don&#x27;t check their accounts. I got charged twice, even after I cancelled. Never even received a product to do business with them. I had to cancel my debit card also as so many others have said.  IT IS TRUE WHAT REVIEWERS are saying! This company should be arrested. The Better Business Bureau warns against them and does not recognize them as a legitimate company. If I have saved just one person from going through what I went through with having to cancel my debit card and having to deal with this, it will be worth it. As others have said, if their product was so good they wouldn&#x27;t need to resort to these underhanded dishonest tactics!&lt;br /&gt;Elementary teacher from Ohio</li>
    <li> I purchased Lifecell and gave it a chance to work, even though they say it works in 60 sec. after applying it...wrong!. Even after a month of using it, nothing. I am 51 years old and have been using the product called &amp;#34;Roc&amp;#34; for many years that i purchase at Walgreens for less than $20.00, I absolutely have no wrinkles (that you can see) My 30 year old has more wrinkles then I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I bought Lifecell believing it would help my sagging jaw line I have noticed lately as it claimed to help.This product did not work. I was disappointing and felt scammed. Getting your money back...well, not easy! They say you feel tingling in your face...nothing!, They tell you to apply a little on your finger tips and rub together to get it warmed up...nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look at it this way, you do not need expensive stuff for your face, healthy diet, LOTS of water and sunscreen, don&#x27;t forget to apply daily moisturizer and then a nightly moisturizer...Thats it! Water is the key though. I will continue using Roc. I get compliments from so many on how young I look, yes I have gotten carded at 51.  Please don&#x27;t throw away your money.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth the cost they charge. They are also crooks. They charged my credit card $4.50 then later $189.00 then I returned product because it does not work they reimbursed me $140.00 but took the $49.00 for nothing. It&#x27;s a big rip off - the product doesn&#x27;t work and they charge you far more than what they state.</li>
    <li> I found that the product did not live up to its &#x27;marketing hype.&amp;#34;  I saw no change in using it and simply stopped.  I found the&lt;br /&gt;product to be very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The internet is like the interstate hwy, every dirt bag in world is out to get you.  BEWARE</li>
    <li> This is the first review that I&#x27;ve ever written about any sort of product, which should say a lot about the product itself. When I stumbled upon this cream I was a little skeptical at first, there&#x27;s so many different anti-aging regimens that promise all sorts of results, and end up being nothing more than a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an animal rights activist I try to refrain from using products that are tested on animals, this is a actually what drew me to this product. I noticed that they were PETA approved and I really liked that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally wouldn&#x27;t spend $189 on a cream, but I figured what the heck? I have nothing to lose, they back you up by 120 days to return the product for a full refund, so I decided to give this product a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months of using Lifecell I can tell you that I am utterly amazed... Never in a million years did I think that I would be comfortable enough to leave the house without makeup and Lifecell gave me that confidence.  I used to have have dark spots on my face, along with large pores... My face is now all one even color and my pores are appearing smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie, I was slightly discouraged within the first month but I am so happy that I stuck it out. This product is amazing and I will never use anything else !</li>
    <li> Life cell has changed my life, I have never felt so good about myself :) I always had big dark circles under my eyes but now thanks to life cell I have puffiless eyes :)</li>
    <li> I have really bad allergies, and with it really bad dark circles. I have tried many different products for dark circles. Nothing works. I am also going to be 50 this year. I have more wrinkles and I am starting to get small jowls. I also tried many products to try to help with both of these. A lot of products I tried seem to help the first couple of weeks and then nothing after that, or they did not work at all. I have been using Lifecell for about a month and a half. I started noticing improvement within the first week. My dark circles are lighter, since is the first time I have seen that with any product. My wrinkles around my mouth from smoking, and the wrinkles between my eyebrows are starting to go away. I also do not have big lips. They were getting smaller from winkles and old age, which is something I cannot afford. They have now gone back to the size they used to be. I am hoping I continue to see the benefits from using Lifecell, and am sure I will. I am especially hopeful on the dark circles. If I had not found this, my next step was to go to see a dermatologist and see what they could do. Which I am sure is very expensive. It&#x27;s great not to have to buy all the expensive eye creams and other products which all add up to the same or more than I was spending on this. For me this is definitely a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now getting ready to enter my 5th month of using this product. Where I will not say the results are fast, but there are still results. I think when you first start using the product your skin plums and you do look better. However there are no fast results that say my wrinkles are gone. I do not think anything can do that. I have noticed that my wrinkles are still slowly getting better with continued use. The indentations that go from the edge of my nose to the corners of the mouth are gone. The other wrinkles look better when I am not smiling, but I can still see them when I do. As far as my dark circles go, I wavered on and off, as to whether they were really getting better or not. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was wishful thinking. Well I can say for sure now, that they are lighter and that they are not as long or as wide as they used to be. My circles were really bad so I am guessing that after a year of use I should be good on the circles. I also want to state that I use the Clarisonic Opal when putting the Lifecell on my eyes. This may speed up the results for the dark circles. Maybe the Lifecell results are not fast, but I am getting results, which is something I have not seen with other products. This will however be my last update. I will continue to use Lifecell, however I am adding the use of a Nuface Trinity to my routine. I do not think that the Lifecell will get rid of those small jowls I am starting to get so going to try the Nuface. This will throw off any results on wrinkles as the Nuface helps to tighten your face and help with the wrinkles. The Nuface is a home microcurrent device for those who have not heard of it. Anyway I still rate this high as I am continuing to see results. You just have to stick with it.they were really getting better or not. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was wishful thinking.

    <li> Ok I don&#x27;t know about ordering from Amazon but if you go for the FREE trial you will be ripped off.  IT IS NOT FREE.  They will charge you 189 dollars for that free trial.  Avoid this kind of rip off</li>
    <li> Although I did not order my LifeCell product through Amazon, I felt I should write a review. First off, the price is much too high.  I have been using this product about two weeks and have not noticed any improvements.  However, I am prone to adult acne and have noticed some bumps in places I normally wouldn&#x27;t have break outs.  I will be returning the product under the terms of the 30 day trail and going back to my vitamin C serum and dermatologist recommended moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old and have pretty young looking skin.  However, I have noticed lines on my forehead and under my eyes so I started looking into anit-aging creams.  After reading the rave reviews on this company&#x27;s website, I decided to give it a try.  Let me first say that the website does not advertise the price- it is $189 for a 2 month supply!  But they offer a 30 day free trial- you just pay $4.95 for shipping and handling.  The product is supposed to make wrinkles disappear in 30 seconds.  Although extremely pricey, I figured that I would give it a try. When I put the cream on, I did notice that it really softens my skin and did temporarily reduce the appearance of wrinkles (it depends how the light hits your face though).  This effect wears off when you wash your face.  After a few days I decided that it really isn&#x27;t worth the price and contacted the company on returning it.  They tried to convince me to keep using the product as the long term effects won&#x27;t be seen for 4-6 weeks (well outside the trial period).  But, I decided that it really isn&#x27;t worth the price.  If you stick with it, they automatically enroll you in their auto renewal program and the 2 month supply bottle is reduced to $149.  I can&#x27;t justify this price with only mediocre results.  If it were $30 a bottle, I might have tried it longer!</li>
    <li> I am waiting to receive my \\&quot;free 30 day trial\\&quot; sample from Life Cell. However, within one hour of placing my order my credit card was debited for $1.25 for the shipping and handling (which I expected) and $189.00 for the cost of the product. So the advertising was false. I am disappointed that I won&#x27;t be trying this product since the reviews looked possibly promising. However, I am trying to cancel this order as I will not purchase from a company that is using deceptive advertising.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money on this item.  I&#x27;m 60 and saw no improvement on my skin after carefully following instructions.  Then the company will automatically continue shipment to you unless you call to cancel.  Watch out!  Feels like a scam.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old and was blessed with youthful, healthy skin.  Up until 2 years ago, I received complements all the time that suggested I looked at least 5 years younger than my actual age.  At 64, that was not the case.  I looked 75 yo.  What happened? Sickness and medication I think.  My face just sagged and seemed to lose elasticity.  I lost my eyelids under my eyebrow and the appearance of puffiness and darkness developed under my eyes (Blepharoplasty surgery estimated cost would be $6000 plus pain and healing).  I developed extreme neck sagging (possibly due to weight loss and illness).  Like many in my situation, I tried all kinds of ointments at a large cost and very frustrating.  I did see some benefits with some ointments and a change in make-up (also expensive).  Last week, I was featured with my daughter and grand-children in several photographs taken by my husband (who&#x27;s pretty good as a photographer and owner of several very expensive Canon&#x27;s and Nikon&#x27;s and lighting equipment).  I was HORRIFIED at my appearance even though I was prepared for the photo shoot with my makeup routine.  The photos can be \\&quot;doctor\\&quot; by my spouse to remove shadows throughout my face and neck so the photos will be okay.  But I&#x27;m not okay.  Facelift surgery including blepharoplasty and neck could run $15,000+, then there&#x27;s the pain, suffering, and healing (:o.  My experience with LIFECELL.  I&#x27;m one of the lucky one&#x27;s  :).  I noticed a difference first application.  After 5th application STILL AMAZED.  All my descriptions above DEMINISHED (not gone) to my satisfaction and relief!  I&#x27;m confident that I will continue to see improvement but even if I don&#x27;t, LIFECELL is worth every bit of the $189.  I realize that it might be too soon to write the review, but I&#x27;m so amazed I had to write it.  Conclusion:  the appearance of my age in my opinion after using LIFECELL, is that of a 65 yo.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my daughter thinks when I see her in 2 weeks.  I&#x27;m absolutely sure she will notice and question my rejuvenation.  I will visit this post in the near future for my updates.  (NOTES:  I am in no way connected with LifeCell or any such company.  I am simply a happily retired 64 yo consumer/customer that&#x27;s even happier now after LifeCell entered my life).  I did not purchased this product from Amazaon.com.  I purchased the product from Lifecellskin.com on their special pay for shipping only, pay $189.00 up at 30 days if not completely satisfied and returned within 30 days.

    <li> I definitely notice a difference, however, its only when I use it, no permanent results. I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using regularly once a day for two weeks and can see a small difference and feel confident that it bring results later on in my usage</li>
    <li> This cream hasn&#x27;t done anything for me and it costs a fortune. Think twice before trying it. Highly disappointing indeed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible made me get a headache instantly..... maybe mercury in this product.. want my money back!!&lt;br /&gt;Made my skin ultimately dry.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried every product, but now that I have found LifeCell, I won&#x27;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LifeCell works in a decent amount of time and is an all in one treatment! (SO much easier than using 3 or 4 different products)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about 3 weeks, I started to notice a difference in my skin. I have rosacea and have never really found anything that works other than expensive creams and treatments from my doctor. It started to reduce the redness around my eyes and cheeks and neck, and then after 4 weeks I didn&#x27;t have to wear as much foundation to cover up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was noticed some wrinkles forming around my eyes and in my forehead, which is why I initially research this product and considered trying it out. After about 6 weeks, they pretty much entirely diminished and then they finally just went away all together once I was about done with the tube. I think the tube usually lasts like 2 months.. which to me is great because I know I, like any other woman, use my products every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had really bad adult acne and it helped clear away the scarring and smooth out my skin. I have had so many problems with my skin throughout my life, if it isn&#x27;t one thing, it&#x27;s another, and I can definitely understand getting tired from trying so many different products that promise results and then don&#x27;t deliver. But trust me, I have NEVER had healthy skin like I do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LifeCell is also actually a preventative (which their website and research doesn&#x27;t really touch on) but as anyone else, I want to make sure my skin stays in great condition. Especially now with the great results I&#x27;ve seen. In the 3 months I have been using the product, and the whole line is something to seriously consider checking out too, I have seen such drastic changes. Quite honestly, I was pretty surprised when I started reading all these reviews. You really do have to just try it out for yourself and then make your own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND this product to anyone. As long as you use it like you&#x27;re supposed to and give it time to work, I KNOW you will see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything else ever again!RECOMMEND this product to anyone. As long as you use it like you&#x27;re supposed to and give it time to work, I KNOW you will see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything else ever again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product directly from LifeCell not Amazon, but had to come and write a review anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I&#x27;ve been dealing with severe cystic acne for the past four years. We have taken numerous trips to the dermatologist&#x27;s office to try and find a solution. My cheeks were covered in dry in grown hair bumps and even bleeding in some spots from the intense dryness and inflammation. It was absolutely horrible. I have tried at least a dozen different creams, lotions and ointments over the past 8 months and nothing has made a significant improvement. I have even tried prescription antibiotic cream, steroid cream and 2% Salicylic Acid ointment. I was applying products to my skin with EVERY face wash and coating myself with night cream before bedtime. It was extremely tiring not to be super sexy anymore, to say the least. The hardest part was that I was seeing little improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, in desperation, I bought the entire line of LifeCell products. I applied it liberally to my whole face immediately after my bath. Towel drying first. I just I can&#x27;t say enough about the results. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks or so and my hyper-pigmentation completely GONE!!! There isn&#x27;t a single dry patch to be found anywhere. My skin is soft, smooth and completely hydrated using the body butter. I am absolutely amazed by how beautiful my skin is in comparison to what it looked like before. Seeing me now, you would never know that I ever had a problem with severe acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on telling my dermatologist about this product next time I see him and will encourage him to tell all of his patients about this awesomeness. No more cracked, ugly skin. No more sleepless nights from no love. No more trips to the doctor and no more expensive, useless prescriptions!!!! LifeCell is a life changer!!!!</li>
    <li> Listen ladies do not waste your money on this product...I have better results with my OTC products at a fraction of the cost.  I am 56 and have nice skin no deep lines and it does not even work for fine lines.  Walk away from this one!</li>
    <li> This cream actually made the pores on my nose appear larger and made my skin break out. I had always used Clinique Dramatically Different Lotion but wanted some extra help with wrinkles since I&#x27;m almost 60. Did not help with that either. Back to Clinique I go!  Also the price is stupid expensive.</li>
    <li> I love LifeCell.  I have only been using it for a week and have already noticed a difference.  My friends say I am glowing.  My makeup goes on better and my skin is luminous.  I have thrown away all other products except a good sunscreen.  I can&#x27;t wait to see more improvement in the next few weeks.</li>
