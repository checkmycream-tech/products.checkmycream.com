<li> Price was lower than any other place I could find.  </li>
<li> Amazon has let me down again.</li>
<li> Not comfortable, not fun, and I would recommend not ever having to use a pair, but if you do, these work.</li>
<li> I am 6&#x27;1, and have the ends extended one inch because I prefer them a little bit away from the armpit.</li>
<li> The crutches offered at local pharmacies were at least twice as expensive.</li>
<li> So if your not at least 6 ft tall don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
<li> Also, the rubber smelled awful from being in the hot delivery truck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1\\&quot;, 200lbs, with one broken foot.</li>
<li> Not impressed.</li>

    <li> Saved a little buying a pair here than from the medical store.  The worked while I used them.  Not comfortable, not fun, and I would recommend not ever having to use a pair, but if you do, these work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a week now. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1\\&quot;, 200lbs, with one broken foot. The crutches support me fine. The pads are not good if you&#x27;re going to let it support you completely by the armpit, but you shouldn&#x27;t do that anyway if you like having circulation. They feel very sturdy but are very light, and have had no trouble putting up with the force I put on them. I move very quickly on them, as I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s easier than going slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downer is the rubber feet are already starting to tear apart. I&#x27;m definitely not going slow with them, and I&#x27;ve used them a good amount on concrete, but not too much, especially after only a week. It&#x27;s cheap enough to replace the feet though, so it&#x27;s no big deal. They also slip very easily on wet ground, as should be expected. Try to stay on carpet or a rough surface.</li>
    <li> Seem really well made, and the adjustability was easy. Am using for no-weight bearing surgery, so am mostly using a knee cart. These are for those times when hauling a cart makes no sense. Watch the length, however. I am 6&#x27;1, and have the ends extended one inch because I prefer them a little bit away from the armpit. If you are under 5&#x27;10-11&amp;#34; these might be too long.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy, well-built crutches. They are light weight, lighter than wood. They are adjustable for both the height of the crutch itself and also for the height of the hand grips. The construction is good quality throughout.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and well made at s great price. I searched all over for crutches for my 6&#x27;2\\&quot; 300lb husband for after knee surgery and couldn&#x27;t find any to fit him or that were stable enough. These do the trick.</li>
    <li> I woke up from a knee scope to find I had undergone microfracture surgery and would need 6 weeks non-weight bearing.  Ordered these as soon as I got home. They arrived a couple of days later. They are easily adjustable and very sturdy. They saved me.</li>
    <li> I expected to get THREE crutches as the picture shows. I only received two, and the shipping box was damaged. Also, the rubber smelled awful from being in the hot delivery truck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, to top it all off, these are not sized correctly.  I am 5&#x27; 11-1/2&amp;#34; tall. These crutches are too long, even though they say they are suitable for 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already printed out the return label. Amazon has let me down again.</li>
    <li> They came in ahead of schedule, no problem with packaging. They were easy to adjust. Work well. Recommend for use if you have to have them. Only issue with them is after a week of constant use to move around, the handles are starting to rub off, or flake if you prefer. Even though they creak while i am moving, they are very stable and I have no worries using them. I am not a small person at 275lb, so most things creak when i use them.</li>
    <li> After a hip replacement my husband needed crutches. These were just right and a great price. They also shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> These are very good quality crutch. I would highly recommend them for someone looking for a better long-term solution. These are extra tall and would fit a person probably from 6 feet to 6 feet five.</li>
    <li> Had crutches about 3 weeks and the \\&quot;bumpers\\&quot; at the bottom did not last. They just came apart.  Wish I could get replacement ones. Otherwise crutches are good.</li>
    <li> Made to much noise when walking. Will try a better grade next time.</li>
    <li> Super adjustable.  And light-weight too.  Two weeks in, they seem sufficiently durable.</li>
    <li> Used these for about 6 weeks and never had a problem. Would recommend this brand if someone were in need of these.</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of scheduled date.  Price was lower than any other place I could find.  I need five more words.</li>
    <li> Light weight and durable. I weigh in at 235 and find the crutches very stable.</li>
    <li> After about two weeks on these crutches the shaft has pushed through one of the feet, and the other one is threatening to blow any day now. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2\\&quot;, 170lbs, and have spent about an hour a day (on average, with high variance) on these crutches. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> the crutches are needed after foot surgery.  I have never used crutches. The crutcg&#x3D;hes were just a described.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping package arrived in good shape and the crutches were ready to use.  It came with instructions were easy to follow, but I also got some suggestions from my doctor.</li>
    <li> When i bought this I didn&#x27;t not notice they said Tall. So if your not at least 6 ft tall don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I received the short crutches rather than the tall ones.  They do look like they are very good quality.  I am sending these back.</li>
    <li> Aluminum is better than wood because you can get them wet (like in the shower). Price for these seemed very reasonable</li>
    <li> Good value. The crutches offered at local pharmacies were at least twice as expensive. I also really like that they were easily adjustable.</li>
    <li> Fine crutches although I did not really use them much.</li>
