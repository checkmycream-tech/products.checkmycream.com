      <li>/&gt;Update May 7, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;Herbodent toothpaste by Dr. Jaikaran (not sold on amazon but sold online) is also a great ayurvedic toothpaste with neem but has a more strong mediciny taste/feel than auromere.  </li>

      <li>Great taste with no dangerous components.</li>

      <li>I am looking to find something that will help keep my teeth and gums healthy.</li>
      <li>I love cardamon,</li>

      <li>Also I better floss</li>
      <li>you are looking for a non-mint flavored toothpaste that does not foam, this is the better choice.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this toothpaste.</li>

      <li>This has become my favorite toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I only brush once a day and still get excellent results.  </li>
      <li>SURE know</li>
      <li>I used to be able to...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m almost out, time to buy some more.</li>
      <li>but when I added Trader Joe&#x27;s Myrrh propolis toothpaste, the spreading was better.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel very clean after brushing with this</li>
      <li>If you do not like the liquorish taste, rembrandt sls free toothpastes are pretty good too.</li>
      <li>- it feels more like a cream smeared lightly in your mouth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over a year and my teeth and gums feel clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>Clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>My breath smells fresher and cleaner without needing a strong listerine mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My breath smells fresher and cleaner without needing a strong listerine mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The flavor may take a couple of days to get used to because it&#x27;s not the typical mint, but the best part is, that unlike mint, as soon as you&#x27;re done brushing, the flavor it gone!</li>
      <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any fluoride in it is a HUGE plus for me, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so using this toothpaste is a huge treat for me.</li>
      <li>This is the primary reason I use it.</li>
      <li>This is such a great toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It not only has a great flavor, it WHITENS our teeth.</li>
      <li>I ordered this toothpaste because toothpastes with SLS (and also some sls free ones) cause canker sores in my mouth.</li>
      <li>But I care more about what ingredients are being absorbed into my body.</li>
      <li>Did not notice any significant improvement in my teeth.</li>
      <li>The taste of this toothpaste is good but light which is a good thing, you can eat or drink something sooner after brushing than common overpowering toothpastes.</li>
      <li>Neem+peelu peelu with a unique aromatic fennel+cardamom flavor...</li>
      <li>Natural, herbal, healing (really is, honest.)  </li>
      <li>It leaves my teeth clean and my breath fresh without the minty flavor</li>
      <li>He wanted me to stop using anything with fluoride, mint, or cinnamon to see if that&#x27;s what was causing mild gingivitis</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s made in India and not some mainstream greedy US corporate-infested corporation that has backwards reductionist non-holistic, greedy profit-driven USA thinking regarding dental health and whose main goal is to make the most profit by giving it to the mainstream at the cheapest price but which also results in them cheapening the ingredients by quality and quantity&lt;</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them to anyone that wants to have healthy lifestyles !</li>
      <li>great product, easy to use to clean teeth nicely, no flouride</li>
      <li>It kind of taste like black liquorish, which I don&#x27;t like to eat at all, but find surprisingly refreshing as toothpaste.</li>
      <li>A toothpaste well worth using.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, this is only one of three types of toothpastes that does not cause canker sores in my mouth.</li>
      <li>Not as good as i expected.</li>
      <li>It does not have any suds, which takes getting use to, but that does not bother me as long as my teeth look better!</li>
      <li>Go right ahead and eat anything or even drink orange juice without the flavor being altered.&lt;br /&gt;Between</li>
      <li>First of all it stained my toothbrush</li>
      <li>Anyway, I like it better than the mint which I buy locally.</li>
      <li>I like it better than any of the regular store brands.</li>
      <li>This is a known irritant and possible carcinogen and many people advise against exposure to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perhaps if you have a higher or different ick tolerance :)</li>
      <li>I just went back for a 3-month check-up, and my dental hygienist was amazed at how much better my gums looked.  </li>
      <li>Only applies to cat lovers of course. :)&lt;</li>
      <li>I like using this more than the store bought brand, for some reason It seemed to me as though it made my teeth whiter than regular brands.</li>
      <li>This paste works very well and tastes much better than the first one I tried, which was the mint-free, which has a different flavor.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the unique flavour, and it doesn&#x27;t mess with the flavour of any food you eat afterwards.</li>
      <li>Auromere is very easy on the mouth with absolutely no stinging, just a smoooooth mouthfeel when brushing.</li>
      <li>I really find it hard to believe so many people love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t been able to wean myself off the regular foaming action of most toothpastes which makes me FEEL as if my mouth is all clean and alive</li>
      <li>and I certainly don&#x27;t want to use a fluoride toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I find that using only a half of a brush of either auromere or herbodent are great for my teeth along with the trader joe&#x27;s myrrh propolis toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I find that using only a half of a brush of either auromere or herbodent are great for my teeth along with the trader joe&#x27;s myrrh propolis toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>The tooth paste has nice lqurish taste and a little bit chock like texture - which I like.</li>
      <li>It is a little odd, at first, not to have the foaming feature, but I am reassured by the fact that the foaming agents are usually not all-natural and am happy to make the change in light of the fact that it is healthier for my body.</li>
      <li>The results of an ALCAT test put me on a very restricted diet.</li>
      <li>I finished this tube and bought Jason&#x27;s powerful peppermint which so far seems to be the frontrunner in my search.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my boyfriend, as he really doesn&#x27;t like foaming toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>On the whole I don&#x27;t like the taste of any toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My mouth &amp; gums feel much healthier.</li>
      <li>When I found out sodium lauryl sulfate was the possible cause of my canker sores, I found Auromere, which was also fluoride free &amp; an Ayurvedic</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The results of an ALCAT test put me on a very restricted diet. I cannot have xylitol and I certainly don&#x27;t want to use a fluoride toothpaste. I was unable to find a toothpaste that had neither. The ALCAT nutritionist told me about this one. I like it better than any toothpaste I have ever used. On the whole I don&#x27;t like the taste of any toothpaste. This one is quite pleasant and herby. Although the box smelled of licorice, you can hardly taste the licorice. A small smear on your toothpaste is all you need. This tube will probably last several months.</li>
    <li> Great flavor. No foam at all.</li>
    <li> Trying to get on the Neem bandwagon for dental care, I ordered this toothpaste with much hesitancy (mainly worried about the flavor). What a pleasant surprise this has been! It not only has a great flavor, it WHITENS our teeth. It does not have any suds, which takes getting use to, but that does not bother me as long as my teeth look better!</li>
    <li> I do not use a fluoride toothpaste. I am not a big fan of chemicals and poisonous substances.&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is awesome ♥</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend, as he really doesn&#x27;t like foaming toothpaste.  He told me it tasted like licorice.  I also tried it, but I think it tastes more herbal than licorice-y (even though licorice is an herb).  Different herb - hard to explain.  It&#x27;s not a bad flavor, but certainly different than what I&#x27;m used to in the traditional mint toothpastes.  I suppose I would recommend for those who have issues with foaming toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, at the suggestion of my dentist.  He wanted me to stop using anything with fluoride, mint, or cinnamon to see if that&#x27;s what was causing mild gingivitis (I live in a city with fluoridated water, so getting plenty of that).  I just went back for a 3-month check-up, and my dental hygienist was amazed at how much better my gums looked.  She said previously my gums looked like they had a mild chemical burn, and now only the slightest evidence of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a nice licorice (anise) flavor, and has been easy to get used to.  I don&#x27;t miss my old minty toothpaste and rinse at all.  I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> if you like black licorice, you&#x27;ll love this toothpaste, if not, then you will definitely hate it...ugh will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toothpaste. I ALWAYS look for toothpastes with neem since neem is highly anti-bacterial and so prevents plaques and cavities and saves me from spending $$$&#x27;s and time and energy and stress going to the dentist which unfortunately has been a constant habit for me ever since childhood. I have serious dental problems with cavities, root canals, and gum disease but not when I use toothpastes with neem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other neem toothpastes and some have SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) which is corrosive and causes canker sores and so I was looking for one without SLS. I like this cardamom/fennel Auromere version because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it has no SLS&lt;br /&gt;2. neem is high on its ingredients list&lt;br /&gt;3. it has many other helpful healing Indian Ayurvedic herbs that help your mouth and body&lt;br /&gt;4. it holds its form better than other neem toothpastes without SLS like Himalaya&lt;br /&gt;5. unlike other neem toothpastes like Desert Essence and unlike mainstream USA toothpastes without neem, there&#x27;s no stinging/irritation in the mouth&lt;br /&gt;6. it&#x27;s made in India and not some mainstream greedy US corporate-infested corporation that has backwards reductionist non-holistic, greedy profit-driven USA thinking regarding dental health and whose main goal is to make the most profit by giving it to the mainstream at the cheapest price but which also results in them cheapening the ingredients by quality and quantity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its licorice taste takes a little getting used to like mouthing licorice candy with the taste of cardamom but after a while, it grows on you. Auromere is very easy on the mouth with absolutely no stinging, just a smoooooth mouthfeel when brushing. As another reviewer said, it does NOT foam up like other toothpastes so if you want all that \\&quot;foam\\&quot; or \\&quot;lather\\&quot; in your mouth (which it would have if it contained SLS), don&#x27;t expect it in this toothpaste - you can barely really tell it&#x27;s actually toothpaste - it feels more like a cream smeared lightly in your mouth. I have felt NO pain nor sensitivity in my teeth or gums since using this toothpaste and my gums have never bled. Hard to believe that there&#x27;s a toothpaste without any pain or irritation while brushing. The size of the toothpaste is small compared to other toothpastes, even compared to non-mainstream toothpastes, but considering all the benefits it gives, it&#x27;s worth the $$&#x27;s. Like another reviewer said, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t been able to wean myself off the regular foaming action of most toothpastes which makes me FEEL as if my mouth is all clean and alive and so I still use tea tree oil, neem-containing [[ASIN:B00016XAAU Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste Wintergreen -- 6.25 oz]] as the finishing toothpaste after I brush with auromere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the non-SLS [[ASIN:B000L425PI Herbal Toothpaste Cardamon-Fennel 4.16 Ounces]] AT THE SAME TIME ON EVERY TOOTHBRUSHING with [[ASIN:B004GYM90A Trader Joe&#x27;s Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis &amp; Myrrh]] for over a month to increase my anti-cavity/anti-plaque/gum healing protection and I&#x27;ve got to say that my mouth has never tasted/felt fresher and cleaner and I FOR SURE know I don&#x27;t need to go to any dentist (no gum bleeding, no pain in my gums/teeth) and the toothpastes together are not as abrasive as when I use Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil and Neem Toothpaste Wintergreen with either one. The problem I had with Auromere&#x27;s toothpaste was because it had no SLS, it was hard to spread it in all the corners of my mouth on every tooth but when I added Trader Joe&#x27;s Myrrh propolis toothpaste, the spreading was better. So in the 2 combinations of toothpaste, everytime I brush my teeth, I know my teeth and gums are protected with the non-SLS [[ASIN:B000L425PI Herbal Toothpaste Cardamon-Fennel 4.16 Ounces]] by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-neem (which helps prevent plaque with antimicrobial properties which can treat periodontal disease and reverse gingivitis)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and other healing herbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and from the [[ASIN:B004GYM90A Trader Joe&#x27;s Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis &amp; Myrrh]], I know my teeth and gums are protected with :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-myrrh (which helps fight infection of mouth and gums. Has a stimulating effect on the gums)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and propolis which is a sticky substance gathered by bees from the leaf buds of trees and plastered over hives for strength which is also an antibiotic and antiseptic that helps fight infections of the throat and mouth and speeds healing of gums. It contains traces of minerals vital to teeth, bones and connective tissues.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 7, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;Herbodent toothpaste by Dr. Jaikaran (not sold on amazon but sold online) is also a great ayurvedic toothpaste with neem but has a more strong mediciny taste/feel than auromere.  I find that using only a half of a brush of either auromere or herbodent are great for my teeth along with the trader joe&#x27;s myrrh propolis toothpaste.  I only brush once a day and still get excellent results.  My teeth have been complimented by friends as being VERY white and they&#x27;ve asked me what toothpaste I use!!  My breath smells fresher and cleaner without needing a strong listerine mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I would brush constantly with the mainstream toothpastes and even would switch to  sensodyne by my dentist but I would still end up in the dentist&#x27;s chair getting cavities plugged up or having a root canal or having long teeth/gum cleanings.  Now that I use these ayurvedic toothpastes, any pain in my teeth from bacteria have been eliminated, especially using the herbodent toothpaste.  I have less colds and less severe colds than I did before I used these toothpastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-and other healing herbs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and from the [[ASIN:B004GYM90A Trader Joe&#x27;s Antiplaque Toothpaste with Fennel, Propolis &amp; Myrrh]], I know my teeth and gums are protected with :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-myrrh (which helps fight infection of mouth and gums.

    <li> This is one foul, nasty, tasting, toothpaste. I do not recommend using it. It is brown and tastes terrible.</li>
    <li> I work for a stanch Ayurvedic practitioner on Kauai. This is the only commercial toothpaste she will touch.</li>
    <li> Great taste with no dangerous components.</li>
    <li> I must confess, I am biased.  I love cardamon, so using this toothpaste is a huge treat for me. I didn&#x27;t now if the fennel would dominate, but it does not.  The cardamon is not too strong, but it is pleasant. The toothpaste does not foam at all, so if that is what you are looking for, this toothpaste is not for you.  However if you are interested in a not sweet, great-tasting no SLS toothpaste, and you like cardamon. you will be happy with this product.  I have used the Auromere mint-free toothpaste for a long time, and to me, aside from being SLS free,  this tastes much better than that formulation.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor of this one and I think all the herbs do something helpful. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t get it shipped to Hawaii at this time. I used to be able to... Anyway, I like it better than the mint which I buy locally.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years.  The best thing about this product for me is that it has no fluoride.  I have had one cavity in 30 years.  And it has no sugar in it or other chemicals.</li>
    <li> When Tom&#x27;s of Maine sold out to P&amp;G and the product ingredients changed to include unnecessary harmful chemicals, I spent a few hours on Amazon looking for a replacement. While this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t make me as happy as tom&#x27;s because it is more herbal than minty, it gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t make me gag. Do I like it like Tom&#x27;s of Old? No. But I care more about what ingredients are being absorbed into my body.</li>
    <li> i bought this in germany and didn&#x27;t realize that it was non-foaming. It is a very unpleasant sensation...as though there is just extra saliva in your mouth... it doesn&#x27;t stay on your teeth well like foaming toothpastes do, so if just feels less efficient. It made me gag the first few times i used it, but i was backpacking and stuck with it. Honestly i prefered just rubbing my teeth with a licorice stick, but i didnt want to have dental problems while traveling.  Eventually i got used to it. Auromere is a great toothpaste, my teeth love it..just not the non-foaming sensation. Perhaps if you have a higher or different ick tolerance :)</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is fine if you want to avoid nasty chemicals-- like sodium lauryl sulfate. I just wish it had a peppier flavor. I know, I&#x27;m used to the zing of commercial toothpastes. Also, it&#x27;s goopy and gray. Even still, I&#x27;ve purchased several tubes to date just because I&#x27;d rather not ingest poisonous substances just to cleanse my teeth and mouth. Until something better comes along, this&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> I like using this more than the store bought brand, for some reason It seemed to me as though it made my teeth whiter than regular brands. It is also nice to know that it isn&#x27;t toxic.</li>
    <li> I tried this toothpaste for a few months, hoping it would be an improvement. I loved the licorice/cardamom flavor - regular toothpaste tasted pretty bad after using this stuff. However, I discovered a few downsides to this toothpaste versus colgate whitening, and have now switched back. The downsides:&lt;br /&gt;-Your cat will love the smell, and come lick your toothbrush! I am not kidding! Only applies to cat lovers of course. :)&lt;br /&gt;-My dentist found I am getting a cavity in between my teeth. Maybe the lack of SLS means not enough foaming penetration? Also I better floss more.&lt;br /&gt;-Even though it says whitening on the packet - I don&#x27;t think it works nearly as well as colgate whitening I was using before - I was noticing a little more staining than before. (I drink tea.)</li>
    <li> My favourite, long-time toothpaste has been discontinued (Rembrandt Extra Gentle) so I&#x27;m desperately searching for a replacement that doesn&#x27;t contain ANY foaming agents. This one is excellent. I love the unique flavour, and it doesn&#x27;t mess with the flavour of any food you eat afterwards. My teeth feel very clean after brushing with this and I&#x27;ve had no irritation or canker sores since I began using it (maybe a month ago).</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever!!! Neem+peelu peelu with a unique aromatic fennel+cardamom flavor... Makes brushing your teeth a true joy for your senses!!!</li>
    <li> The flavor may take a couple of days to get used to because it&#x27;s not the typical mint, but the best part is, that unlike mint, as soon as you&#x27;re done brushing, the flavor it gone! Go right ahead and eat anything or even drink orange juice without the flavor being altered.&lt;br /&gt;Between this product and my tongue scraper, my breath never smells bad and my mouth is clean &amp; healthy without poisoning my body with chemicals like fluoride.</li>
    <li> I am looking to find something that will help keep my teeth and gums healthy. I have been using this product and look forward to my next dental appointment to see what the results are.</li>
    <li> It is a little odd, at first, not to have the foaming feature, but I am reassured by the fact that the foaming agents are usually not all-natural and am happy to make the change in light of the fact that it is healthier for my body. The flavor is great (like anise), but if you don&#x27;t like licorice, you may be turned off by it. Also, it is a gray color, which some people may find unappealing. If you can get past the color and not foaming, I would recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> great product, easy to use to clean teeth nicely, no flouride</li>
    <li> I have perioral dermatitis which is aggravated by SLS and fluoride. I&#x27;ve tried a few natural toothpastes.  This, so far, is the absolute worst. And I hated the last one I tried! I really find it hard to believe so many people love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I don&#x27;t mind the licorice flavor, but there&#x27;s a muddy/chalky thing that goes along with it. It also leaves your mouth feeling icky - not fresh and clean. Every morning my three year old tells me how bad my breath smells. There&#x27;s no &#x27;confidence&#x27; with this stuff. I never felt like my breath was not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Whitening? I think not. First of all it stained my toothbrush so I refuse to believe it actually whitens teeth. My toothbrush also started to stink if that tells you anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this two stars because it&#x27;s difficult to find a toothpaste without SLS and fluoride so I give them credit for the effort.  Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead buying it again.  I finished this tube and bought Jason&#x27;s powerful peppermint which so far seems to be the frontrunner in my search.</li>
    <li> This paste works very well and tastes much better than the first one I tried, which was the mint-free, which has a different flavor.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a non-mint flavored toothpaste that does not foam, this is the better choice. Leaves no aftertaste. Now if they would just add flouride for me...</li>
    <li> good item and smell good.</li>
    <li> The taste of this toothpaste is good but light which is a good thing, you can eat or drink something sooner after brushing than common overpowering toothpastes. Don&#x27;t buy if you want your toothpaste to foam up, this is non-foaming toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS: Fine Chalk (a gentle cleanser), Glycerine (from vegetable oil), Water, Herbal extract blend: [Peelu (Salvadora persica), Neem (Azadirachta indica), Indian Licorice root, Pomegranate rind, Commom Jujube, Rose Apple, Clove, Persian Walnut, Barleria prinoitis bark (Vajradanti), Indian Almond, Bedda nut, Asian Holly Oak, Prickly Ash, Zanthoxylum alatum, Sappan wood, Catechu, Bengal Madder, Acacia arabica bark (Babul), Sarsaparilla, Cinnamon, Medlar bark, Mayweed, Bishop&#x27;s weed (flower extract)], Silica, Carageenan (from seaweed), Cellulose (plant) gum, Fennel oil, Cardamon oil. Ingredients from manufacturer&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My teeth are noticeably whiter since I started using this with an electric toothbrush (Diamond Ultrasonic Toothbrush). I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for over a year and my teeth and gums feel clean and healthy. Will update with results whenever I get around to seeing a dentist.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite toothpaste. Not found anything else out there that can touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I use toothpaste with sodium lauryl sulfate, I always end up getting a canker sore. With this toothpaste I never get canker sores. This is the primary reason I use it. But, I also have grown to love the flavor. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t have any fluoride in it is a HUGE plus for me, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Rembrandt canker sore toothpaste (now called Gentle White) for years, but it was often not on the shelves where I shopped. When I found out sodium lauryl sulfate was the possible cause of my canker sores, I found Auromere, which was also fluoride free &amp; an Ayurvedic formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients of Auromere Ayurvedic Non-Foaming Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine Chalk (a gentle cleanser), Glycerine (from vegetable oil), Water, Herbal extract blend: [Peelu (Salvadora persica), Neem (Azadirachta indica), Indian Licorice root, Pomegranate rind, Commom Jujube, Rose Apple, Clove, Persian Walnut, Barleria prinoitis bark (Vajradanti), Indian Almond, Bedda nut, Asian Holly Oak, Prickly Ash, Zanthoxylum alatum, Sappan wood, Catechu, Bengal Madder, Acacia arabica bark (Babul), Sarsaparilla, Cinnamon, Medlar bark, Mayweed, Bishop&#x27;s weed (flower extract)], Silica, Carageenan (from seaweed), Cellulose (plant) gum, Fennel oil, Cardamon oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free of fluoride, gluten, bleaches, artificial sweeteners, dyes, bleaches, animal ingredients and artificial preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit to get used to non-foaming toothpaste. I&#x27;ve been using this product a couple years &amp; my teeth are whiter than when I was using regular whitening toothpaste. My mouth &amp; gums feel much healthier. I felt I should pass my experience along.</li>
    <li> Trying to avoid SLS in my toothpaste so I tried this toothpaste.  This tastes good, but doesn&#x27;t quite give me that &amp;#34;freshly brushed teeth feeling&amp;#34;.  So what I do is brush with the other sensitivity toothpast &amp; finish with this for the flavor ;-)</li>
    <li> This is such a great toothpaste. Not like the toxic ones you find at the typical stores. I&#x27;m almost out, time to buy some more.</li>
    <li> I purchased the wrong product and was disappointed in the flavor, but I was able to find someone who preferred this taste to the one I usually buy.  The person who took it was happy with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this toothpaste because toothpastes with SLS (and also some sls free ones) cause canker sores in my mouth. The tooth paste has nice lqurish taste and a little bit chock like texture - which I like. Most importantly, this is only one of three types of toothpastes that does not cause canker sores in my mouth. If you do not like the liquorish taste, rembrandt sls free toothpastes are pretty good too. I use both brands depending on my mood of different toothpaste tastes.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this toothpaste since it contains peelu and neem which are meant to be excellent for your teeth and gums. After purchasing it I found out that it contains \\&quot;sodium lauryl sulfate\\&quot; as an ingredient. This is a known irritant and possible carcinogen and many people advise against exposure to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could be an excellent toothpaste if they would take this ingredient out, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I like this tooth paste. It kind of taste like black liquorish, which I don&#x27;t like to eat at all, but find surprisingly refreshing as toothpaste. I usually make my own, but use this in between. Definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> A toothpaste well worth using.  Natural, herbal, healing (really is, honest.)  Clean and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this company and their products! I highly recommend them to anyone that wants to have healthy lifestyles !</li>
    <li> Not as good as i expected. It made my teeth yellowish. Tastes good though. Did not notice any significant improvement in my teeth. I returned it and now i use a miswak stick a million times better than conventional toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I like the taste and find that this toothpaste whitens my teeth also!  I like it better than any of the regular store brands.</li>
    <li> I feel better about brushing. Feel healthier. Therefore I am brushing longer. Have an appointment coming up with my dentist so I will have an update coming.</li>
    <li> This is a great SLS-free toothpaste. It leaves my teeth clean and my breath fresh without the minty flavor I don&#x27;t particularly care for.</li>
