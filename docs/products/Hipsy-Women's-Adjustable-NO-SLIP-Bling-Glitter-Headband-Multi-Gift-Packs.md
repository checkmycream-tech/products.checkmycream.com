<li> They are super small, ever after adjusting them as big as possible, and I have a small head.</li>
<li> Also, they do not really stay in place.</li>
<li> They are adjustable and have a feltish fabric underneath to help from slipping.</li>
<li> They are one long circle with a little plastic piece to shorten or lengthen.  </li>
<li> They aren&#x27;t so tight that I get a headache either.</li>
<li> Not what I was expecting and a waste of money for me.</li>
<li> So, I am not sure if it was the headband or my head.</li>
<li> These were a gift for my wife, who has had a hard time finding a well made, thin, headband.</li>
<li> Dude a lifetime without these headbands is just depressing!</li>

    <li> Really nice headbands, very sparkly.  Not sure I will wear them everyday, but the sizing on them is great.</li>
    <li> These are really cute and they actually stay in place. I usually have to use bobby pins to keep these kind of head bands from falling out. These I can just tighten and they stay in great. They aren&#x27;t so tight that I get a headache either.</li>
    <li> These headbands are amazing!! I love them! All my friends have borrowed mine and then bought their own because they loved them so much too!!</li>
    <li> I gave these to a friend for her birthday &amp; she loves them.</li>
    <li> Dude a lifetime without these headbands is just depressing! They are comfortable, no seriously, I slept in one. No headache, no sore ears, just a nice band! Perfectly made, a few seconds of practice on the adjustment, and I was set for the day!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these headbands.  They keep my hair out of my face and do not hurt or cause headaches.  They are beautiful and you can&#x27;t beat the price for 5 of them for what some of the other options cost for one.</li>
    <li> Regular headbands slip off my head but with these adjustable ones that is no longer a problem.  The stay in place all day!</li>
    <li> Very nice quality for a low price. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> love love love these. so comphy i forget im wearing them. I wish they had colors that were not glittery though I am 40 not 12</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife for her birthday.  She has never been a headband person since she has short curly hair.  Im pretty sure she&#x27;s worn one of these every day since I got them.  They dont slip out of her hair and are comfortable.  She really loves them and has already told me that I need to get her more in the future!</li>
    <li> These are great for wearing around your forehead or your hair, they&#x27;re good quality and comfy to wear. They are so pretty in person and are vibrant in color and sparkly too.

    <li> These are the most comfortable head bands I have ever had  I want more! And everyone that sees them wants them:)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like these because they really sparkle and look more like something a tweeny would wear rather than a &amp;#34;woman.&amp;#34;  They are one long circle with a little plastic piece to shorten or lengthen.  Not what I was expecting and a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> These are really cute - gave with other little gifts to daughter&#x27;s friends (teenagers) and a year later they are still wearing them all the time.  Sparkly, but not tacky.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these and I can&#x27;t see to find the same quality around town.</li>
    <li> Great headbands. They are adjustable and have a feltish fabric underneath to help from slipping. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these would not slip and that I could wear them like you would a headband. I have come to the conclusion that my head is not shaped right for headbands. So, I am not sure if it was the headband or my head.</li>
    <li> Love these they stay put in my hair with out having to use clips to hold them in place.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan. They are super small, ever after adjusting them as big as possible, and I have a small head. Also, they do not really stay in place.</li>
    <li> These were a gift for my wife, who has had a hard time finding a well made, thin, headband. They seem to be doing great, and my wife loves them!</li>
    <li> These are the BEST!!!!!  I am buying more for my Christmas gifts!!!!  Plus, the company has been SO wonderful to work with!  Thank you HIPSY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These are very nice colors and shine.  They stay on mine and my daughter&#x27;s head pretty decently.  Sometimes they still slide a bit but nothing like regular ones.  These are very good for the price.  I&#x27;ve bought ones similar to these for almost $18 for one.  So these are great.</li>
