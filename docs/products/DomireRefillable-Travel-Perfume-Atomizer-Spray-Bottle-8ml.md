<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> No leaks. easy to fill/re-fill. convent size for travel or purse.</li>
    <li> Absolutely genius.  It&#x27;s easy to fill, easy to use, and easy to carry.  The clear front panel lets me see exactly how much is in there, so I can refill as needed.  The size of an average lipstick, it fits perfectly in pocket or handbag.  And most importantly, I don&#x27;t have to overspend on travel sizes of my favorite perfume.  THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Good one delivery time in two days and high quality product . but it too expansive i found it in ali express for 2$</li>
    <li> Great item - just what I needed to carry perfume in a dress purse!</li>
    <li> With the current and probably long-term 100ml liquid restriction in place for carry-on luggage, this is an excellent product for air travellers. It&#x27;s called the &#x60;Travalo&#x27; and is a small, tough refillable spray container for perfume, aftershave etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer claims the device has a regulator which adjusts to the variable air pressure during flights (passenger cabins on commercial airliners are usually pressurised to that at 7,000 ft. elevation or thereabouts). It is leak-proof, robust, convenient and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s available in different colours so you can carry more than one and easily identify the content of each. You can obviously use it anywhere, not just in-flight. It&#x27;s very convenient and as a design, hard to fault.</li>
    <li> My leak my perfume. I don&#x27;t why?</li>
    <li> I had tried the fill-your-own rollerball tubes only to find they either leaked in my purse or the glass containers BROKE, leaving everything in my purse covered with perfume.  This is FANTASTIC solution.  Just pop the spray cap off your current perfume bottle and pump directly into this travel case through the one-way slot in the bottom.  I like that it has a see-through fill window so you know when it&#x27;s full and you know when you&#x27;re running low.    I have 5 of these in different colors for the various fragrances I wear, and I&#x27;m giving a ton of these as gifts this year.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my Christmas Secret Friend, and she loved it... It was the coolest gadget that was given that day, and everyone wanted to have received one like it. I&#x27;m getting one for myself, my mom and other friends. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be the one giving the best gift :D And for a fabulous price!!!! I totally recommend it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: a few days after I got one for myself, It spilled all the perfume in my purse, do It wasted all my perfume, and it ruined some thing I had in my purse!! Very poor quality, I had to throw it away!!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for my 12 day vacation. Now I keep it in my toiletry case and use it regularly for my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> Does and works exactly as described. Just make sure you keep the bottle completely straight and pump slowly, otherwise you&#x27;ll have a fragrant mess on your hands.</li>
    <li> I bought this cuz i dropped a bottle of red door and it stopped spraying...i cut the bottle n transferred it to another body spray bottle and now i use the atomizer to pump it out to use..Its a great product but i don&#x27;t see the need for more than one..(u don&#x27;t need different ones for all your fragrances as it it pointless) and frankly if i didn&#x27;t need to get the half bottle of perfume out i won&#x27;t buy it it for travel...I usually save my almost empty perfume bottles for travel..</li>
    <li> it was so difficult to open i had to send it back - I found one that works fine and is easy</li>
    <li> I bought the double set with leather holder.  Perfect for the purse and for travel.  So good I ordered another for sister.</li>
    <li> works great and holds a good supply of perfume for traveling</li>
    <li> This little gem solves the problem of perfume all over your hands and the sink, which is what happened when I used to use a funnel and a spray bottle of perfume to fill a purse spray. The Travalo travel spray filled quickly and with no spillover, exactly as promised. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; perfume containers.  This one is great, doesn&#x27;t leak and works as advertised.  You fill it from the bottom, and has enough perfume for about 50 sprays, which is way more than those other containers I tried did.  I liked it so much, I bought one for my husband for his cologne.  Meets/exceeds TSA regulations for size, and I couldn&#x27;t be more delighted.</li>
    <li> This little atomizer is awesome.  It really works great and its so nice not to lug a big old bottle of perfume when I travel.  This atomizer is so easy to use, if I can do it, anyone can do it.</li>
    <li> Perfect and easy to use travel perfume holder.</li>
    <li> great little gadget for the purse. it does not leak or spill over and works just as described.  It is also easy to travel with - no issues with oversize</li>
    <li> I did not think this would work or last but it does and it has.  I have had this for over a year and it is still working.  I am going to purchase a couple more because I am not sure how if would fare if I put other perfume in it after using a different perfume for so long.</li>
    <li> I am such a fan of travalo&#x27;s. They have saved me many times from breaking a whole perfume bottle in my purse or suitcase. They are great for touch-ups when you feel that your perfume has worn off throughout the day.</li>
    <li> My Travalos work just fine.  Bought one two months ago and filled it with Chanel No.5.  After 5 or 10 sprays, bottle is still filled to appropriate capacity. With small gadgets like these, sometimes manufacturing can yield a few \\&quot;misses\\&quot;, but I would simply return the item for another.  I just bought a second one because my first works so well.  It is great, convenient, chic and possesses the quality and functionality it appears to have.</li>
    <li> I just love these!  Small but holds enough - perfect for any size purse.  Easy to fill!!  Makes perfect gifts, too.</li>
    <li> Easy to refill.  I put the atomizer inside a small, sealed plastic bag before putting it in my toilet kit and packing in a carry-on bag.  It was fortunate I did so because the atomizer leaked and was wet when I went to use it after my arrival.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these because of the great reviews.  When they arrived, I filled them about half way.  The first one started leaking as soon as I put some perfume in it.  The second one loaded up just fine but when I took it with me in my back pack on the plane it started to leak. They are both going back.</li>
    <li> This is a good addition to travel items.  Is easy to use but my advice is to follow the filling instructions.  While I really like and continue to use this item, I gave it 3 stars because of the following 2 reasons 1.  Contents seem to evaporate rapidly.  2. On occasion it does not spray well but will emit droplets instead.  Being that, because I travel frequently, am continuing use in spite of the circumstances stated.</li>
    <li> One thing that I love the most when purchasing online products is quality customer service. The customer service with this company was far and beyond. They contacted me as soon as I left a review and offered me a full refund..and my only complaint was a disfunctioning item. I was so pleased and impressed because usually companies ask you to leave reviews and never contact and follow up on your reviews, but this company did and for that I will be shopping with them again.. THANK YOU SO MUCH :o)</li>
    <li> I gave this a 2 stars bec it wouldn&#x27;t fit in my Nina perfume that I wanted to transfer over bec the bottle has a leak. The pumper in the perfume is too big to even fit that I ended up not using this. What a bummer😑. I&#x27;m so disappointed. This is made for smaller perfumes. Probably sample sized bottles. They should have mentioned it in the box so that you can decide whether to buy it or not.</li>
    <li> nice product with nice idea but i belive after using it alot the intake valve where you refill the spray will get stuck and some time its hard to refill it.</li>
    <li> great product, only gave it four stars because i wish it was a bit bigger... like 10-20 ml bigger. generally lasts me about 2-3 weeks with 1 spray/day</li>
    <li> This thing is really tiny, but can carry enough fragrance to last you maybe a good week or two! (I usually spray 3-4 times a day) Filled up 3 times now and taken on a few trips, so far this thing has been great. Fills up fast and easy (just pull off the spray cap from your perfume or cologne bottle and pump!) and doesn&#x27;t leak at all. Sprays are a little concentrated, but you want to rub it in anyway! All in all, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to quite well.</li>
    <li> The container leaked after only about 3 uses.  Quality very poor.</li>
    <li> I have 2 bottles of old spray perfume that are clogged. I went online and searched the web on how to get it unclog but nothing worked. My last effort before I found this was to destroy the bottles and save whatever that&#x27;s left and put it in those mini freebie perfume sample bottles. This thing totally saved me from doing all of that! Now I can transfer my old fragrance to this atomizer. It hasn&#x27;t leak yet so I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase. Will buy another one for the other fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also very light so you will save a lot of weight and room by not carrying a glass perfume bottle when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/27/14 Update: I filled the whole atomizer with my favorite perfume and use it twice. Weeks later it&#x27;s completely empty. I don&#x27;t think it leaked (my purse didn&#x27;t have any stain), but the alcohol/perfume just evaporate.. poof! gone! 4 Stars. Still love it but won&#x27;t fill much at a time.</li>
    <li> Beware with counterfeit units, this is the real one and works!!! The fake ones looses all perfume and it lasts nothing, they leak!. This one works!</li>
    <li> I have gotten other products out there like this, but have been disappointed to find out that they leak.  This one doesn&#x27;t!  I take it with me to work, trips, etc.  and it lasts a good while!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this perfume carrier, it&#x27;s compact, sleek and won&#x27;t leak!!!  Plus, perfect for storing inside your purse, when you want a little spritz!</li>
    <li> I loved this atomizer initially. However, it leaked all of my expensive perfume. I&#x27;d buy more and gift them to everyone if they didn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> I bought this same atomizer in the Philippines at almost same price. At first I regretted buying it but after I filled it with my perfume I was happy I bought it. Did not encounter any problem with leaks or anything.</li>
    <li> When I got these I bought two for presents and one for myself.  Now I can&#x27;t speak for the people who received them as presents (sorry guys) but I&#x27;ve been less than happy.  The idea is great.  Fill it up with your favorite fragrance and pop it in your purse.  Perhaps my problem is that I don&#x27;t use it quickly enough but the two times I have tried to use it (as in refilled twice) the perfume was empty.  Evaporated, leaked?  I don&#x27;t know but an empty atomizer in my purse is just a waste of my perfume and my money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute and small. It is easy to use and it does not spill. I would recommend any of my friends who carry those big body sprays everywhere to get one of these.</li>
    <li> I travel allot and this prevents my favorite cologne bottle from being picked up by TSA agents when I bring my carry on. Works great!</li>
    <li> I tried this on several brands of fragrances of varying bottle sizes and it DIDN&#x27;T FIT ANY OF THEM. This was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Everything I hoped.  However it is a bit touchy - mine broke fairly quickly.  But my daughters atomizers are still working....so perhaps it&#x27;s just me.  If you want to travel or have a spritz of your favorite perfume in your purse this is the thing to get.</li>
    <li> This is so handy. I&#x27;ve gotten a few and love the convenience of having my fragrance with me on the road. A must have for every woman&#x27;s make up bag.</li>
    <li> Excellent for travel. Did not leak. Can only use for one perfume. Tried to use on a Bath and Body product and was not successful.</li>
    <li> Great item!!! Love this , easy to use . Carry your favorite scent with you everywhere!</li>
    <li> Easy to fill...I use it everytime I travel.</li>
    <li> Amazing product by travalo&lt;br /&gt;So slim &amp; sexy&lt;br /&gt;easy to refill and never faced any problem with it!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars all the way</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have one for each scent I wear! It doesn&#x27;t leak the size is perfect and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought this travel atomizer so that I can stop traveling with a big bottle of perfumes. Has worked great ! When filled up completely last for a week of traveling, Also great size for carry-on luggage.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling. So compact and such a great idea.</li>
    <li> Thank you.  They are great gifts.</li>
    <li> I love these things and gave several for gifts last year.  Easy to fill, perfect for travel or in your purse.  They can leak a tiny bit but I have 3 and only 1 has.  I just put a bit of tape over the bottom and still use that one.  These are great!</li>
    <li> Great travel atomizer. It gets filled in a very smart, non-messy way.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and very travel friendly. I always want to take my favorite perfume but never was able to because of the size of the&lt;br /&gt;bottle.  Now I am able to take it with me everyday in my purse. I also gave one to my sister and she loved it. Gave one to my husband and he loved it also, since he works out on his lunch break, he is able to take his shower and spray on his favorite cologne. Great find, if you are looking for something that you can carry your favorite perfume and is travel friendly, easy to use,looks nice Travalo Travel spray is for you.</li>
    <li> Started leaking out of the clear window before I could even use it. Great idea, just infomercial level construction that wont last a week.</li>
    <li> Perfect for having your favorite purfume with you at all times.... Especially travel.</li>
    <li> I really love these little atomizers.  It allows you to make a &amp;#34;purse size&amp;#34; of any of your perfumes.  Some perfumes don&#x27;t even have a &amp;#34;purse size&amp;#34; available, and if they have one it&#x27;s usually very expensive. The only thing that&#x27;s a little disappointing is that it&#x27;s very hard  clean it if you wanted to change fragrances. I avoid that issue by just having several of them for different fragrances.  I gave out 4 of them for Christmas and they loved it too!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a Burberry scent where the spray nozzle had gone wonky........didn&#x27;t work for that tho since it&#x27;s totally wonky. But worked great on other normal operating spray nozzles. Great product.</li>
    <li> Although this device seems to hold the perfume in somehow, it also mysteriously lets it escape over time.  It is very easy to fill, which is good, but if you do not use it every day, then the perfume inside will go to waste since it disappears on its own!</li>
    <li> I received one of these as a gift at Christmas and I wanted to get one for my daughter because she travels and now she can take her favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Love it and would recommend this to everyone.  Would make an awesome stocking stuffer for the girls.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Cindy  Wilson</li>
    <li> This little item allowed me to travel on my cruise in style and with a fragrance that I often get comments on. The Travalo is easy to use: just take the little cap off of your larger perfume bottle at home, and press the little plastic opening thing at the bottom of the Travalo Atomizer onto the &amp;#34;stem&amp;#34; of your own perfume bottle, and pump. You can see your perfume rising up into the atomizer. I had done this and tried the atomizer several days ahead of my journey to make sure it worked consistently. I even had traveled with the Travalo Atomizer in a baggy to ensure if anything leaked out, my clothing would not be damaged. But there was no leakage! I had 3 airplane rides each way to and from Italy, went on a cruise, as well as a bus ride and two train trips around Italy where my bag was constantly being pushed around. The Travalo worked like a charm. Planning on giving this as Christmas presents to all my friends and family this year!</li>
    <li> These are amazing-- gave them away as gifts after I was given one.  Travel with it all the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. 5 day trip used less than half of charge.</li>
    <li> Perfect perfume holder for your favorite perfume. I&#x27;ve had 3 of these &amp; they all work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I got this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy the little tiny bottles of my perfume to carry with me, since it does tend to fade halfway through the day.  It&#x27;s very easy to refill, holds a good amount (unless you go crazy heavy with your perfume, I suppose), sprays a nice sized even mist, has a solid lid, and nice little liquid level view window.  I use Hugo Boss Deep Red so I kind of like that the color indicates my perfume, but I suppose not everyone is that lucky.  &#x3D;P  It has a subtle, satiny sort of finish to it, which is nice, as I prefer more matte type finishes to things.  I&#x27;ve had this in my purse for about 5 months now without issue, and I&#x27;m happy I gave this one a go.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the first time I filled it, it leaked from the top (not the filling port) constantly and I never got to use it.  Too bad because it is a wonderful little size and so easy to fill.  The sprayer seemed to atomize well too.  Maybe mine was just defective but I&#x27;m not going to reorder it.</li>
    <li> I love always having a few Travalos around to make my own travel size perfumes. These things are super easy to use and a perfect size for storing in my carry-on or purse. I only wonder how I&#x27;ll clean them when I want to swap out scents, I&#x27;m worried the smell of the original perfume will be absorbed by the plastic. I also wish they were slightly less expensive. Bottom line, this is a convenient and well-designed product, and it will make you have criminal fantasies of raiding the Sephora fragrance section with your Travalos so you can have have each and every one all to yourself...</li>
    <li> It dosn&#x27;t spray well. When i press lid to spray, it sends the liquid badly to evry direction. I mean it pours the liquid out side the lid which indicates that there is a problem</li>
    <li> worked great until I lost it a week later.</li>
    <li> This is my first atomizer and it is so easy to operate. Definitely give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned five of these.  Of them, one works.  One would not take fluid. The rubber ring in two continually come out when trying to fill them.  Four leak--one from the bottom and the top.  The one that works is flawless, but one out of five is crap odds.</li>
    <li> What a great product. No longer do I have to cart around a bottle of perfume. It is so easy to fill. Planning on getting more of these.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this, but found that when left in my suitcase, over time it appears to not be well sealed since it let the cologne leak out. Probably ok for short trips.</li>
    <li> I bought a 4.3 oz of Daisy Perfume by Marc Jacobs (On Amazon) for a great deal. Almost as much as the 2.oz, but as I was getting ready for a 2 week trip I realized I could not take my perfume. I checked out the price for the 2.oz and refused to pay the same (expensive) price just so I could take my perfume. I went to Dillard&#x27;s to find something and they told me to try a Atomizer. So, I came to Amazon of course to look for one. It eventually to me to this little awesome thing! I didn&#x27;t know how to use it and nearly broke it trying to figure it out, but I got it and now I LOVE IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T TAKE ANYTHING OFF OF THE TRAVALO ATOMIZER!&lt;br /&gt;1. Just take the bottle out of the package. Do not remove the cap or lid or ANYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Get YOUR perfume, remove \\&quot;JUST\\&quot; the cap... (the part that sprays)your perfume bottle will now just be showing the plastic part that sucks out your perfume. DO NOT LOSE YOUR CAP TO YOUR PERFUME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Just take the Atomizer and look at the bottom. You will see a little hole. Align that hole with the plastic thing and start pumping your perfume into the atomizer. It is super easy, and the perfume does not leak.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these little things and have had no problems. (so far) I wish I would have thought of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying these for Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> I had no idea this product even existed until my mom bought it for me for my birthday. Then I started buying them for my girlfriends. They&#x27;re inexpensive but also a product that every single woman wants and uses. What&#x27;s better than that?</li>
    <li> I bought this and the [[ASIN:B004T19R3W Flo Refillable Perfume Atomizer]].  I liked this one for being smaller.  it seems a little cheaper, but the smallness makes it more attractive for carrying in a clutch.  I like the way this one loads better than the Flo.  I have not carried it yet; i will revise this if carrying it causes problems.  So far tho, loading it and using it at home, I have not seen leaks yet.  It&#x27;s clearly inexpensively made, especially compared to the Flo, but it seems more reliable, and it&#x27;s still pretty enough to take out in front of people.</li>
    <li> easy to fill... nice compact design.</li>
    <li> Have used these on 4 trips now. They hold about a weeks worth and don&#x27;t appear to leak at all.</li>
    <li> Travelo Atomiser fits easily into handbag etc and great to take on a short trip. Easy to fill and easy to use. Have given as gifts to family members and they have been impressed with them.</li>
    <li> I love travalo products. I have 4. They are very easy to fill and have never leaked. I use these both for keeping in my work bag and for brining on the plane when I travel.</li>
    <li> So cute and compact.  Love it.</li>
    <li> You take more capacity?  Excent product !</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel, bought several for gifts.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s hit or miss on these Travalo Atomizers. First one I got (black and different packaging than this) work flawlessly to this day. My cologne will stay in there for months even after forgetting about it. This one, if I leave it in my pocket overnight in the wrong direction, it&#x27;ll be drained the next day leaving my pockets smelling like a french whor(n). Bought another one just to give it another chance and it&#x27;s not leaking AS BAD, but leaking none the less.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you would expect.</li>
    <li> These are great. Easy to fill no problem in using. Highly recommended.</li>
