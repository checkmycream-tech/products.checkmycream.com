<li> My 86 year old Mom has had me looking everywhere for these rollers!  </li>
<li> These are a had to find item, as strange as that seems, and My mother loves them.</li>
<li> No idea, other than to say...</li>
<li> this is just what my mom was looking for - she is 89 years old and they are very, very hard to find in the store.  </li>
<li> but find the bristles way to stiff, hard to use with short hair and when you go to remove them&lt;</li>
<li> little pricey</li>
<li> ONE NEEDS THE SMALL ONES</li>
<li> The bristles fall out and have to be combed out of  my hair, Also they shed on the furniture and floor and become  a menace for pets and small children.</li>
<li> The green rollers are hard to use, I thought they were brush rollers, hard for the hair to adhere to rollers.</li>
<li> Bought these for my Mother and they were too small even for her!</li>
<li> /&gt;they are difficult to do so and at times you have to literally pull them away from the hair.  </li>
<li> too painful to sleep in</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

    <li> VERY SATISIED EXCELLENT DOES THE JOB WE WANTED AND THE PRICE VERY REASONABLE, THWRE ARE SO MMANY PLACE ONE NEEDS THE SMALL ONES</li>
    <li> The green rollers are hard to use, I thought they were brush rollers, hard for the hair to adhere to rollers. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> They get stuck in the hair, and the white things on the rollers shed.</li>
    <li> I Loved my Brush rollers, I wish I could find small mini rollers 3 x 1/2&amp;#34; then I would buy more! Thank You for your prompt service.  Please let me know if you have the size I mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend you to all my friends and relatives!</li>

    <li> I suppose they are o.k. but find the bristles way to stiff, hard to use with short hair and when you go to remove them&lt;br /&gt;they are difficult to do so and at times you have to literally pull them away from the hair.  Not what I am use to.</li>
    <li> How do I write a review of curlers? No idea, other than to say... They work. I like the tiny curlers for my short hair... Change of pace.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>

    <li> My 86 year old Mom has had me looking everywhere for these rollers!  She wears her hair in the style favored by many older ladies and much prefers a &amp;#34;roller set&amp;#34; to having her hair done with a curling iron.  These certainly fit the bill!  They seen sturdy enough for the weekly hair do.  The 16 rollers in the package are plenty for rolling all her hair at once.  I was glad to be able to find these!</li>
    <li> just what I wanted :-)</li>
