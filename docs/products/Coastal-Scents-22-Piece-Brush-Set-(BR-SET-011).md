<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love love love these it was so worth it!!! Fast shipping! Great deal!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but they look nice but have a very strong factory smell have to wash them first</li>
    <li> Several of these brushes have been useless for me (giant fan brush, lookin at you) but the eye brushes more than make up for this. Love the three different types of angled eye brushes. I use them for eyeshadow as eyeliner and to fill in my brows. This set is especially great for someone just starting out as it gives you a variety of brushes to experiment with before figuring out what works best for your routine.</li>
    <li> The brushes are absolutely usable but about the quality as the ones at Ulta.  The only brushes that I really have issues with are the liner brushes, the handles are to long for me to get close enough to the mirror to see the detail work I am trying to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping the set though, as the brushes wear out I will replace them one by one with a quality I prefer.  This set lets me try different sizes of brushes are probably would never had bought individually to see if I like them.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with the quality of the brushes, they are soft and good quality and of the same quality of Body shop brushes I paid $15 a brush for! I haven&#x27;t had any shedding of the brushes (as of one wash) and they do the job. If you&#x27;re looking for an excellent starter brush kit that isn&#x27;t a waste of your money, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> THEY ARE THE ONES I USE TO DO MY MAKEUP AND OTHER PEOPLE&#x27;S TOO AND THEY ARE GOOD FOR THE PRICE. ALL OF THEM WORK PERFECTLY, THEY ARE NEW AND THEY ALL SERVE THEIR PURPOSE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CONVENIENT MAKE UP BRUSH SET THAT IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE, YOU SHOULD BUY IT.</li>
    <li> My brushes had a lot of fall out especially the third one the flat top brush</li>
    <li> Works well according to my wife. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the quality.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love these brushes as much as some of the rave reviews I&#x27;ve read posted here on amazon, I really did. I was thinking I&#x27;d be one of them. When I ordered them, I got so excited to get them. And they&#x27;re not bad or anything, but they&#x27;re not as good as everyone seems to be saying... There is a chance I got a bad batch, but after seeing more recent reviews on youtube and reading reviews about them on the coastal scents website and elsewhere, what I&#x27;ve realised is that this brush set reached its peak in quality from the time they came out in late 2011 (I think September 2011), until about a year and a half ago - which is when I noticed reviews about them started to get less consistently good. Like a fool, I waited too long to get them - I was really thinking it over for a long time (like two years!) whether or not I really needed them - and when I finally decided I should buy them, the quality went to pot in the meantime unfortunately, compared to what they were.    Firstly, many of the brushes I have seem to have been made with a lot less hair in them than they were previously made with. Most notably the large fan, small duo-fibre round powder brush, the angle blush brush, and concealer are much less dense. The small round powder brush in particular seems to almost not even be there, it doesn&#x27;t have many hairs in it in the first place, compared to videos I&#x27;ve seen of youtube beauty vloggers who have reviewed the same set. The other annoying thing about the brushes is that most of the eye brushes haven&#x27;t been trimmed correctly, and even one or two of the bigger face ones have strange stray hairs in some spots. And some reviewers have mentioned shedding - I&#x27;ve experienced this the most specifically with the angle blush brush and the dark pointed blender - but almost all the natural fibre eye brushes have shed at least a little bit.    What can I say? I&#x27;m disappointed. I believed the hype and based on that I bought the set. I know some people who&#x27;ve reviewed thisset say it&#x27;s much more than just a beginner&#x27;s set, but I can&#x27;t agree. If most of the sets are of the same quality as what I&#x27;ve experienced mine to be, I&#x27;m sure no professional makeup artist would be raving about it. It&#x27;s perfectly usable and adequate for a beginner, when you consider the price, but it&#x27;s laughable to be considered as MAC replacement or even anything close. On a positive note, the case is very nice, and even when some of the brushes begin to die on me, I can certainly replace them with better quality ones over time. I&#x27;ve had them for about a month and I&#x27;ve been consistently using and washing them the whole time. I&#x27;ll continue to use them until they all break down and die, but at the moment I&#x27;m also collecting better quality brushes already (like Real Techniques and most recently the Shany 24 pc. Pro Signature brush set which has much more consistently rave reviews than this one). It&#x27;s too bad I&#x27;m all the way over in Europe otherwise I would have just returned them. I&#x27;m excited to be getting my Shany set which I recently ordered - it really does seem to be professional quality, and more like what this coastal scents one used to be. I just hope I&#x27;m not disappointed by that one like I was with this one. Because the Shany pro signature seems to be a fairly new set, released just late last year, I thought I&#x27;d jump on it this time instead of wondering and waiting until the quality goes down like with coastal scents- because that was also when coastal scents was at the top of its game too. I&#x27;ll be leaving a review on that one after it arrives and I&#x27;ve used it for a while, just as I&#x27;ve done with this set.    But in the meantime, if you&#x27;re interested in this brush set as a beginner, go for it! I&#x27;ve heard on the American coastal scents site there&#x27;s lots of sales and you might as well get the deal. But if you&#x27;re a professional makeup artist or a more experienced makeup user, this set is perhaps not what it used to be if you&#x27;re already used to good, professionalquality brushes.</li>
    <li> I got this brush set because I didn&#x27;t have any brushes and I wanted to start use them to expand my knowledge of makeup application. This kit has almost every kind of brush that most people use for every day makeup style, plus some extras to play around with. However, you do get what you pay for as far a brushes are concerned, if you are super serious about it, it is better that you invest in better quality brushes. Higher quality is better for the health of your skin in the long run. Not everyone has the funds to purchase high quality brushes and this is a decent alternative as well as a way to transition if you don&#x27;t know exactly what you are looking for. I would recommend this brush set for a short term beginner brush set.</li>
    <li> These brushes are everything everyone has said and more.  Extremely soft, shed only a little*, high-quality makeup brushes in  every size and configuration you will ever need.  Even my makeup snob daughter was impressed.  I am ordering another set for her so she will stop using mine! *At first I said they don&#x27;t shed but then the black blush brush started shedding :(  The natural bristle brushes seem better in that regard.  Still love these brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> Love them! They make my makeup so flawless and smooth looking. Best brushes ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush set for months now, so I&#x27;ve gotten a chance to try all the brushes in the set. At first, I was absolutely in love with this set. The brushes are soft, decent quality makeup brushes. The eye brushes are perfectly fine, even after they&#x27;re washed a few times. In contrast, the larger face brushes began to shed like CRAZY after I had been washing them for a few months. Specifically the flat top stippling brush and the flat foundation brush(which I use and wash the most). They&#x27;re shedding so badly that they don&#x27;t apply as well as they used to, and they&#x27;re less dense. I plan on buying more, better quality face brushes. I still liked the set, but they weren&#x27;t made to last.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes...still soft and no lost bristles, something that used to happen to me with my old set from Bare Minerals.  I&#x27;ve washed the brushes several times now and they are like brand new.  Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> I find it very workable, The quality is pliable, the variety is good for the different purposes.  I think it will last longer than the&lt;br /&gt;32 brush set.  I have to clean every brush after each use, and I do think that is a wear  on the brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with new makeup techniques, so I needed more brushes that had different purposes. After reading reviews and watching reviews on Youtube, I found that these were the best brushes for the money. When I get them, the packaging was very nice and completely sealed. The case that they come with is great too. You can easily find what brush you need. I hardly ever have any fallout from the brushes, and they are very soft. These are great brushes for anyone that&#x27;s just getting into makeup.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SET!!! I bought 2 sets to fill up my already growing collection. I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist &amp; I have tried all kinds of brushes from cheap to pricey. I do own a lot of MAC as well so I can tell quality from quantity. There are steps on finding the perfect brushes: Natural (animal hair) or synthetic. I honestly prefer the synthetic and these did it for me big time. also find a set that has all different brushes not 3 or 4 of the same one lol The giant powder brushes in here are bomb! This set is super reasonable on price considering you get all the important brushes you need. Great quality thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> these brushes are amazing I just bought a $10 eyebrow brush and my coastal brushes work just as well I would recommend this brush set to anyone!! I had no issues with the hair falling out as I washed them and the quality is A++</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing. Especially for someone who is just learned how to apply makeup properly! Ive already recommended it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> For the most part i love this brush set. the problem is, when i washed my brushes(i always do),  the fourth one in the set (exclude fan brush when counting), it opened up, lost its shape, bristles started shooting out... a complete mess. So i was really not happy about that. apart from that, i&#x27;m content</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes soooo much!!!</li>
    <li> This set is amazing. I am barely getting into makeup and I thought this set would be great. The brushes are so soft. No hairs fall out. GReat product. Would recommend for people starting out.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set! Such a great price for so many high quality brushes :) I wanted something high quality enough but also cost effective since I didn&#x27;t wanna spend hundreds of dollars on a makeup set. This is a great product that meets both requirements for me. I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> they are so soft and fast delivery within 1 day that i order them!!! great quality i will defiantly recommend them and i will be buying 2 more sets for my sisters :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and so economic!!! I&#x27;ve been using them everyday since I got them. They are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to these brushes from ELF...and the eyeshadow brushes are actually really good...I went on the Coastal Scents website to purchase the brushes individually...smh...they only come in this set.  So, I&#x27;m waiting on a fa-boo-lus sale price to buy another set.</li>
    <li> These brushes lasted me over a year (almost 2), these were my first real GOOD makeup brushes. I absolutely loved this purchase, I don&#x27;t regret it! These brushes were soft and made my makeup blend a lot easier and nicer together. Within a few years I became a makeup artist and I would extremely recommend these brushes for people that want a decent-good quality of brushes without breaking your bank for it!</li>
    <li> Great product was on times as seen in picture...bought for my teen daughter for Christmas hopes she loves it.</li>
    <li> Great brush kit for a Makeup Artist just starting out.</li>
    <li> I bought 1 for myself and 2 others as gifts.  Everyone loves them, including the hardest critic...me!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this set. I was debating on buying them because I&#x27;m not familiar with this brand. But I absolutely love this set. I guess the only thing that I questioned is the smell of the bag, smells like plastic or brand new cheap shoes. But I&#x27;m sure the smell will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for cheap, good quality brushes that will be used everyday then buy it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves the brush set!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely positively in love with these brushes. They arrived less than a week of ordering and were nicely packaged. I will say the smell was rather different, but no worries because as soon as I washed them, the smell went away. I use these everyday and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase! Great price and great quality!!</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes are amazing and the price is the best part! I searched for makeup brushes for a while and these are by far the best I found!</li>
    <li> I was crazy proud of these brushes when I received them. They are so beautiful I had them on display. Get these brushes right away. Why spend hundreds of dollars? Good quality, good looking, feels good on your skin, a makeup artist&#x27;s must have.Case makes it easy to carry.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very comparable to sigma. These brushes do the job. It gives you a wide range of amazing quality eye brushes! I won&#x27;t be buying any other eye brushes for a while now... I think I&#x27;m set to go! :) The face brushes are also very soft and compact. The big duo fiber brush reminds me a lot of the Sigma f50, except it&#x27;s a lot more dense and compact for pressing in your foundation. Overall I would definitely recommend this set, it&#x27;s great for people starting out with makeup especially. It pretty much gives you every brush you need. I was also very impressed with the brush roll. There is a strong chemical smell when you first get it, but after a few days it airs out. People seemed to think that was a huge problem, but it goes away after a while you guys.. I didn&#x27;t find that to be a problem. The face brushes are great for liquid foundation, cream foundation, powders, highlighters, etc. Pretty much anything. You can&#x27;t beat the price, what a steal! I won&#x27;t be buying any brushes for a while, this is overwhelming! :)</li>
    <li> 1st off, I got my brushes earlier than they said and I opted for the free shipping so that was great!!! I&#x27;m a professional make up artist and quality of brushes matter! After watching videos on youtube and reading reviews I had to get these and they are awesome! I ordered brushes before and paid a lot of money and the quality was awful, these brushes are of excellent quality. They may not have the price tag or the Name of Mac and Sigma, but the do not lack in quality. If your a makeup artist just starting or a pro these are must have! I love these brushes and will be buying two more sets. One for me and a back up for my clients.</li>
    <li> I love this brushes set.  The only bad thing is that when I got them, one of the brush/powder brushes was missing, so I only got 21 on my package. I will definetely claim the provider, but besides that, those brushes are perfect!</li>
    <li> Very convenient and high-quality item!</li>
    <li> Excellent buy. For a small set of brushes to do your make up for weekend getaways and for everyday use if you wear make up everyday. And comes in a cute traveling bag.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and for the price! Amazing! The quality is great and no synthetic smell. Probably going to get another one soon to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> One of the greatest surprise gift I gave to wife.</li>
    <li> They are nice but the brush part comes off the handle not glued on very well.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Come exactly as expected ! They are my favorite brushes! Love love love!</li>
    <li> I love the set of brushes</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new set of brushes and started at Macys, Sephora and Ulta.  Decided to check on Amazon and am so glad I did! This is a great brush set for an excellent price.  The bristles are soft and there is a great variety to choose from.  I love the bag it comes with as well.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It looks beautiful! :) I&#x27;m anxious to have my daughter use them to know if they are good.</li>
    <li> These brushes are wonderful ... well worth the money.  Very soft with no shedding &amp; I love the case &amp; the cover over each brush.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush set!&lt;br /&gt;Soft on your lids and face, complete set of brushes for every need, it looks really pro and helps a lot with your makeup.  Just wish they switched some brushes and added more lip and brow ones.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely great. Such a bevy of choices, gosh! I was so thrilled. It doesn&#x27;t shed or anything, not at all. It&#x27;s such good quality. I love it all. It&#x27;s perfect. I feel like a makeup artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Definitely not one of those things where it&#x27;s cheap so it sucks. It&#x27;s cheap and good quality, how awesome is that?</li>
    <li> I love them so useful, I really recommended these products</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical that this brush set could be any good given the really good price for such a large set, but I am pleasantly surprised.  The brushes are great!  There is literally a brush for anything you could possibly think to do on your face and they are great quality.  I don&#x27;t get the hairs stuck on my face from these like my other high-end brushes.  The carrying case does have a bit of a funky odor to it when you first get it, but that wears off in a few weeks time.  I highly recommend these.  The entire set costs as much as one higher end brush.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Gave as a gift to daughter n law. She loves th ed m</li>
    <li> Perfect! I use them for profesional work and it works!</li>
    <li> I cannot even begin to explain how happy and pleased I am with these brushes. As a wannabe cosmologist I honestly can say that these brushes are pro material. My best friend LOVES these brushes and she is a master at makeup! Have not used them yet, but from what I have observed and felt I can tell these will be great tools! MUST GET.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. You think they feel soft right out of the package? Try these babies after their first wash. They&#x27;re very lush &amp; soft after that. For a price like this, you really can&#x27;t beat it. I really have no desire to purchase any more brushes now that I have these. I have all I need because of this set. Also, my brush roll didn&#x27;t smell, as some reviewers stated.</li>
    <li> this is the best quality for what you get it sturdy brushes with good hairs and fibers and with a sturdy case great for traveling was show exactly on picture matches looks great bueatiful set</li>
    <li> These are the softest brushes ever. I love how they apply my makeup.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushed, they pick up alot of pigment. I noticed a little bit of shedding on some of the small fluffy/blending brushes but nothing crazy.</li>
    <li> This brush set is the best I have ever had. All the brushes feel really soft and are good quality, there is so many to choose from. I highly recommend this set, it is a must!!!</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price. Was a little disappointed in a few of the eye brushes as I feel they do not pick up enough product but overall it is a great buy for the money and I would recommend this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this brush set! Has every type of brush you need for everyday makeup application to special occasionsfor a flawless look! Plus i love that the brushes come with their very own protective shape holder. The brush roll case is also great for traveling and storing the brushes!For the price you won&#x27;t be unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> LOVE them! They are soft and don&#x27;t shed. Great variety! Definitely a great brush set and glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> I really really like this set. As far as eye brushes, it has just about everything you&#x27;ll ever need. And, it&#x27;s really good quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;But, the doe-foot brush I received was a little misshapen, and the face brushes other than the first 3 are a bit smaller than you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> These are quality brushes for the price. There&#x27;s some shedding in a few of the shadow brushes during the first wash, but didn&#x27;t notice anymore shedding when I used them. These brushes are just as soft as other expensive brand name brushes. I compared it to my brand name kabuki brush, not much difference. Mind you that brush cost as much as the whole 22 pcs set! Yes, there is a plastic smell which i&#x27;m sure will go away. I just wished that the brushes were labeled, but otherwise, I&#x27;m 100% happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> they are pretty good brushed. I misplaced my MAC brushes when I was moving and I bought these for a cheap replacement and they were a surprise. after washing them and allowing them to air dry they are soft and very sturdy brushes</li>
    <li> I think the quality of these brushes is amazing for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to brushes. I&#x27;m pretty minimalist when it comes my makeup(powder, blush, only). I&#x27;ve searched and found these based on reviews. This set was more than I expected. The quality and quantity of these brushes exceeded my expectations, no shedding. What I would have liked, would be a basic outline of the specific uses of each of these 32 brushes. I&#x27;ve used 4 of these so far.</li>
    <li> This brush set is definitely great for beginners or MUA&#x27;s looking to get started in the industry. The quality is good and the brushes hold up well after being washed. I wish the large fan brush was more dense, but it is nice for brushing away shadow fallout. Also, I wish the shadow brushes in the kit were more diverse, some seem to almost be duplicates of one another. Overall, quality is good and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> They are amazing for the price! My makeup artist wanted and I boughten it for her as a gift</li>
    <li> It is made in China!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this to be sure it is made in USA with high quality, but unfortunately it is made in China and same bad quality as we have here in our home country.</li>
    <li> You need to get this. Thus set of brushes are not only good quality but you also get it for a fantastic price. Get it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> These are worth the buy!!! Really soft and sturdy. Could also be compared to high end brushes and it has all the brushes you need for daily use at a great price!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they pick up makeup well, and spread it out evenly and flawlessly too. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet so I don&#x27;t know how much or if they will shed but I am completely satisfied with these brushes. Really worth the money, better than drugstore brushes by far. So if you&#x27;re looking for a rather decent brush set for a decent price this is it.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box I was hit with a very strong chemical smell.  While examining the brushes I noticed that some where already losing hair.  And when I ran my finger along the hair you could see a fine dust poof out.  I guess that&#x27;s what you get for $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of losing more money in return shipping I will keep them.  Hopefully the smell and dust will go away once I wash them.  They are pretty soft, that&#x27;s about the only thing I&#x27;m pleased about at this time.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! I am a start-up MUA and i wanted good quality brushes and not have to spend big bucks on Sigma or MAC to start. So on my search i vame across these brushes. I have to say they are awesome! There is a brush for all the makeup applications. Im very happy i bought them and probably will purchase another set just to have :)</li>
    <li> Wow!i am still amazed by the quality of these brushes and the price?very affordable.At first,i was scared to buy them after a bad experience with a brush set i bought online..but after reading some of the reviews,i decided to take the risk..i am glad i did.i bought 8 of them,in less than 2weeks i sold all and have just bought another 10.They re extremely soft and do not shed.lovely case too..i love them!!</li>
    <li> Very nice and soft brushes</li>
    <li> Bought this brush set for my wife. The packaging smells like gasoline however she seems to like the brushes, only had for a month now but still no complaints. I would buy these again.</li>
    <li> For what you pay for, these are pretty nice brushes. I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist or anything, so I can&#x27;t say if they are great for professional use. Good deal and nice soft brushes. I&#x27;m in make-up heaven!</li>
    <li> I received my brushes and I must be very objective.  First, I have to say I love the case. Do not know if it&#x27;s real leather but is very cute. Only lacks the tape to place at the waist while doing makeup.  The brushes are very soft. That&#x27;s something I love about this product but I have to say  the hair fall.    These brushes would be suitable for someone who starts with makeup but not professional so I do not get it 4 or 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am a make up artist an I can say that I have used some expensive brushes. Low cost and high quality is what you get with these brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredible. For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. When I was reading reviews I saw a bunch that mentioned the smell, but like with any new brushes, upon receiving them I washed all the brushes. Although this takes some time because there are so many, it&#x27;s just cleaner because you never know what has come into contact with any brush you put on your face. After letting the brushes dry over night and spraying the bag &amp; letting that sit over night. I never smelled anything again. The brushes are unusually soft, it&#x27;s amazing, and they are everything a girl could possibly need!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price you won&#x27;t find it anywhere else.. Love all the brushes just the big Flat brush is a little too big but I don&#x27;t use that so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased this brush set. I had a few that I was eyeballin but went ahead and made the plunge for this one. I do not regret it at all! I find myself using almost all the brushes, and its great having such a variety to try new looks out. Never again will I have to say &amp;#34;if only I had the brush for that!&amp;#34;. I just wish this set would have included an eyebrow spoolie and an eyelash comb. Other than that, each brush is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I love them!&lt;br /&gt;Great brushes and great price.</li>
    <li> I normally cheap out on brushes but my best friends birthday is today and I had to get her something! She is a magician with make up and plus I love her too much to skimp on the product. These are so soft and are of such great quality for the price. I am so happy with this purchase that I will be getting some for myself soon.</li>
    <li> Amazing price for such quality brushes!!!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist, and although I have pro memberships with several popular makeup companies, I&#x27;m not a brush snob. I was looking for new brushes for my kit for a couple of jobs I have coming up, and was allllll over the internet searching. I purposely avoided my pro sites and was just going to use them as a last resort b/c of the cost per brush. One of my makeup friends told me about Coastal Scents and when I saw them on Amazon, I had to check them out. I paid the $34.95, and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I tested them on myself several days during the work week, and not only are they soft, but they haven&#x27;t shed. I will update this when I wash them, but I love them so far. I appreciate that practically every makeup need is met in this set. The fan brush is huge, so it would be more appropos for dusting highlight on the body and not the face. The eye brushes are soft and not scratchy, and the same goes for the powder/blush brushes. The only downside is that the bag has a bit of an odor, and if you are sensitive to smells, that may be a problem. I believe it to be just the bag b/c I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to the brushes when they&#x27;re near my face. If you plan to use the bag, it may be worth airing out on the porch or patio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two more sets of these brushes b/c I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes when I order from Amazon, after I buy, the item price goes up. I was able to get that fantastic price again. I highly recommend this set.</li>
    <li> My first set of amazing brushes, and I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;Just as great as high end brushes (ULTA, Sephora, etc.) and definitely cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;I love playing and doing with my make up with these brushes :)</li>
    <li> being on the cheaper side of makeup brushes, I was paranoid they would not be as good of quality as other bushes I have purchased. This set is amazing. The brushes are good quality for the price. The hairs do not fall out, and they have stayed in tact through more than one cleaning. I use these every day and have not at all been disappointed!</li>
    <li> recommended for anyone looking for a  full set of great quality brushes or just getting into make up application the professional way!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and comes in its own durable case for travel. Having had some high end brushes from MAC, I decided to try these out. They are easily of similar quality, with no problems re: hair coming out of the brush or falling apart. I would recommend them to anyone who&#x27;s serious about having well-blended and detailed makeup but doesn&#x27;t have the money to buy an entire set from MAC.</li>
    <li> Overall great brushes for an excellent price! These brushes are just as good as the $40(each) brushes from the cosmetic store. The only negative I have is that a couple brushes were a little smashed due to the roll brush case. I personally stick the brushes I used often in a short glass candleholder with some sand in it.</li>
    <li> These are soft and nice. The color chipped from the handles is my only complaint. But I use them. Easy to wash.</li>
    <li> I wanted a large brush set as my go-to for basic make-up application, but I definitely didn&#x27;t want scratchy crap-quality brushes.  This set is INCREDIBLY soft and dense.  You can tell they are top quality and you will not be disappointed.  I have yet to see how they hold up to make-up application, as I have to wash them first.  And you have to make sure you initially wash any cosmetic brushes you purchase; you are putting them on your face!  I&#x27;ll update on that as soon as I test them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Amazon for a while now and never have written a review before, but this product is a must. You get 22 brushes for only $24! That in itself is an amazing deal for this quality! These are professional brushes! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and I know everyone else who purchased will be as well.</li>
    <li> The big ones are ok. Not super soft but nice. But the little ones! Arrrrggg! The eye shadow brushes are awful! They are shredding like crazy! So much that im afraid to wash them. And the eye shadow brushes are hard. If you ask me, save your money, they are not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent SO much $$$ on MAC and Bobbi Brown brushes, these are just as good! They literally picked every brush a professional makeup artist needs! The only brush it didnt come with was a pencil brush like the MAC #219; which is a highly recommended brush-A MUST HAVE!!! However, I looked on Coastal Scents website and they sell a brush identical to the 219 from MAC for only $3.00!!! I paid anywhere from $20-$25 for my 219. I usually don&#x27;t go out of my way to write a review but I must say.. You will NOT find a better brush set for this price! I washed them before the first use and there was some shedding but no problems since then. I can tug on them and no hair comes out. Love them!!</li>
    <li> Great quality and variety!</li>
    <li> I love love love these brushes.  Even washed them before using and i got VERY little to no bristle fall out of them.  They are soft and great quality!</li>
    <li> I love my new brushes! They are high quality, shipping was fast, and you can&#x27;t beat this price for a 22 piece set!</li>
    <li> I am more than happy with this product. Thank you so much for the great product and affordable price! I am so pleased with the variety of eye brushes and very pleased with foundation brush. I have really been looking for a good one!</li>
    <li> Brushes arrived today and the set is an amazing value!  The set includes 22 brushes and a case which has ample space to include brushes that you may already have.  The brushes are very soft and I gave them a nice tug and swirl to see if any shedding would occur and they stayed intact. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Pros: 1) Quantity, multiple sizes for similar task brushes, 2) natural and synthetic brush heads, soft to the touch (hand/fingers), dense. 3) The flat buffer brush is lovely.  I will and have used this one for foundation - buffing it out.  Love this one - my favorite in the whole set. 4) The carrying case the brushes come in is lovely (after you let the chemical smell - VOCs - diminish).  It is of very good quality, and several of the larger brushes all come with brush head protectors too - nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: 1) For me - too many eye shadow brushes (as I keep my eye shadow pretty simple for work), 2) the powder brush - synthetic hair is NOT soft on the face...Every time I try to use it shorter stiff bristles &amp;#34;scratch&amp;#34; against my face and I&#x27;m barely touching my face with it.  I&#x27;ve tried it several times, washed several times - still rough.  I will not use this one again. 3) The foundation brush (flat head - like a larger concealer brush) is NOT soft on the face either.  The length of the hairs are shorter than other brand foundation brushes thus making it scratchy on the face.  Even when I use it just to &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; on foundation, I feel the hairs poking into my face.  I&#x27;ll be sticking to the one I already have - longer hairs - not bristle jabbing.</li>
    <li> The set worked perfectly for me.  They didn&#x27;t smell like some people said they did.  And there are not shedding like most brushes do.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality set of brushes, i definitely am surprised at the quality, especially for the price its a great deal! I gifted this to my sister in law and she absolutely loves it too!</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived by the time I needed them, my two complaints?&lt;br /&gt;One THEY SMELL TERRIBLE, really chemical and letting them air out for a night and spritzing perfume didn&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s not the brushes as they smelled fine after a good washing, it&#x27;s the case.&lt;br /&gt;Then (this complaint might not even really count as i think it might be my soap) they seem (specifically the smaller black haired ones) to shed quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Past that they do the job wonderfully and are amazingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;8/10 would still recommend~</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing but An outer box wasDamaged</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. For someone who is new to using different brushes for applying different areas of makeup, i have to say these make me feel like a pro. Amazing just amazing.</li>
    <li> Super soft brushes, you will not find a better quality brush set for this price.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes and the case is a good way to store and transport the brushes. All in all a superb purchase and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I love them, use these more than my other brushes😍</li>
    <li> Havent had brush for more then a month and the are already falling apart</li>
    <li> these are the best brushes i ever purchased. i would definitely recommend this set to anyone thats trying to achieve different looks everytime you apply make up.</li>
    <li> Wife liked these brushes. After awhile she upgraded, but was a nice set to start off with.</li>
    <li> This case has literally every brush you could need. I have to admit that when I first opened I was overwhelmed and thought &amp;#34;how could I possibly have a use for so many brushes&amp;#34;, but now I do use every one for different occasions. All of the brushes blend well. I will even say that a few are almost identical to Sigma brushes. Such a great price for so many brushes. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this set. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use at school and everyone in class loved them! They are a good quality!</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft, but I already experienced some falling out from the bristles and I just received my brushes yesterday.</li>
    <li> I had been considering buying brushes, i was looking into the MAC bruses, but those were TOO expensive.. I was able to purchase a 22 brushes with what i would&#x27;ve only purchased 2 at MAC. Good brush quality, brisels don&#x27;t fall off.. over all i am very satisfied with the brushes!</li>
    <li> As a pro makeup artist, these were a useful and inexpensive addition to my kit. There are a few I don&#x27;t use but these would be a great way for new artists to start building their kit without spending a fortune.</li>
    <li> This make up brushes are a very good deal , specially if you are starting to do your make up or even to do make up for work . I just love them I have the Mac brushes and compare to this , they have a very good Cuality . One thing I dint like about this brushes when I got them . Was the they had a bad smell I had to wash them at least 3 times before j used them and now they are find .</li>
    <li> For a nonprofessional these are great. Low to no shedding. They were really worth the money. Had there been a brow brush I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I, like many was suspicious of a brush set featuring so much for so little $$$. This is legit, and a great brush set. You&#x27;ll feel like a modern day Bob Ross with this set. Absolutely recommend this set, the brushes aren&#x27;t cheap, and a decent upgrade if you&#x27;re looking to expand.</li>
    <li> The packaging of the brushes is very attractive and easy to handle. . The brushes are wonderful, soft and sturdy. Love them.......</li>
    <li> They are really nice brushes! Used once so far but love how soft the hair is !</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. As a makeup junkie, I&#x27;m purchasing new items all the time and i can safely say this is in my top 5 favorite makeup brush sets yet. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I know other reviewers have had some issues with shedding, but my MAC and Sephora Professional brushes shed 3x worse than these.  I&#x27;ve had minimal shedding and I clean them with a clarifying shampoo after use and put them back to their original shape to dry.  I like these so much that my boss had me order a set for the salon for bridal makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about two months now and they work great.  It did had that plastic smell but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  After you clean your brushes, it goes away.  When washing the brushes, I did not notice any of the bristles falling out so that&#x27;s a positive.  Love them and it was a good buy for my budget.  I don&#x27;t really care for the pouch because I don&#x27;t tend to use the brushes as often when they are in there but it comes in handy for travel.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very high quality. I was so shocked when I got the set and they were so good. I would have paid $20 for each brush if they were sold at a store! I highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> I bought this set 3 years ago and it&#x27;s still great. I am a makeup artist so needless to say they get a lot of use! I ordered these Saturday and they arrived Monday afternoon! I bought this same set again so I can use one just for myself. Absolutely GREAT buy!</li>
    <li> Love these brush sets, affordable and durable</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t wait long for this product at all. It came 3 days later from when I placed the order. I liked the way the brushes had that plastic protective covering  on each individual brush when I received them. The leather case that &amp;#34;houses&amp;#34; the brushes I like, Its good quality and seems very durable. I do wish the side pocket that is in the case was a bit bigger. The brushes aren&#x27;t the best quality compared to the high end brushes, But I am satisfied. I just recently noticed shedding but that&#x27;s probably because I was not properly cleaning the brushes like I should. I washed them the other day and let the brushes air dry and they&#x27;re brand new again.  This set has mostly everything you need for your basic makeup routine. I feel its a great beginners set. I will purchase more brushes in the future and I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying them from coastal scents I really like them</li>
    <li> I received this set as a gift. I am no expert when it comes to make up but these brushes are great! No hair has fallen out of mine and there is no stench from my make up case. I haven&#x27;t used them enough to wash them yet so we shall see how the bristles hold but I have faith they will not fall out. My only complaint and why I give it 4 stars is for not being familiar with brushes and I wish it came with a list of what brush is what, their name and its intended use. I kind of have to guess :-/</li>
    <li> All the brushes that I need for a reasonable price. I will leave another review later for the quality because I haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
    <li> nice price , quality is ok</li>
    <li> Love these and will be buying them again soon. Lasted 3 years</li>
    <li> Fits all my needs to apply make up! love the leather feel like case. Fits in any of my bags when I&#x27;m on the good and need to apply makeup outside of home.</li>
    <li> Great value for money the brushes are great I love them</li>
    <li> Everything is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The only BUT is that the case has a strong plastic smell.</li>
    <li> igual al catalogo.....</li>
    <li> I am still in high school and was looking for some decent brushes for a low price. These brushes are great. They don&#x27;t shed and the large powder brush is VERY dense. They are not the softest brushes but they have good weight in the handle and are excellent for non professional use. I really love them and the set is very complete. You really don&#x27;t need any other brushes :)</li>
    <li> I love these brushes--they feel very soft to touch.  I have not use them yet but I know I will be good.  The only thing is that I wish they put some numbers on each of the brush to help guide what its for AND instructions on how to use each brush as I am not a professional make up artist.</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes is incredible for the price. The bristles are so soft and they&#x27;re not flimsy like some cheaper brushes. This is a great kit for beginners that are just starting out with makeup and don&#x27;t want to break bank. The case has a foul odor, but that&#x27;s to be expected and it fades after a couple of days. I love that it comes with brush guards. The brushes should be washed before use, I personally recommend using Parian Spirit. It is the best brush cleanser I&#x27;ve ever bought, it removes all makeup from the brushes as well as gel liner and lash glue, which if you use any of those you know they&#x27;re difficult to get off the brush. It also leaves your brushes smelling so nice, it&#x27;s a citrus like smell. The fan brush is not as thick as I&#x27;d like it to be for highlighting, but it&#x27;s good for wiping away fall out. I wish the brushes came with number to help identify the brush like brushes from MAC. There&#x27;s no lip brush or tapered highlighting brush, but I you can buy those separately. I recommend Sigma or Sedona Lace for good quality brushes without having to pay a lot. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for a great price. It gets the job done very well.</li>
    <li> This product came in and the brushes are so soft and lovely and the hairs aren&#x27;t falling all over the place, and they don&#x27;t stink! These brushes are 100% worth it!</li>
    <li> I thought their would&#x27;ve been a variety of eye brushes. Theirs three of the same but different sizes. Save up for the expensive brushes</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes after ive watched a million reviews on them. the price was great and for a new comer to make up the are easy and applies the make well. really excited i bought these!!</li>
    <li> The brushes were soft and well made. Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about a month now.  They have made everyday make up application (whether it be&lt;br /&gt;simple or more involved) a snap.  I&#x27;ve found that the stippling brush (the large flat ended one) to be my favorite for applying foundation, which gives the make up a soft, seamless finish.  The whole set, actually, has been amazing to use.  I never realized how lovely make up goes on when you have a quality brush set.  I especially love the way my eye shadows look when applied and blended with these brushes.  They hairs on the various brushes are soft and feel so luxurious when they touch my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that in the beginning, I felt a little daunted by all the different kinds of brushes in this set, so I printed the photo of them that&#x27;s posted in the product info.  Based on the caption explaining the function of these brushes, I labeled the thumbnail image of each brush.  I keep this in a drawer in my bathroom and refer to it if I forget which brush does what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wash these brushes weekly, and they clean up well and look great after they&#x27;re dry.  I did notice a few stray hairs that fell off a couple of the brushes during cleaning, but it only happened once and didn&#x27;t recur the other times I&#x27;ve washed them.  The case they came in is lovely, too.  It looks nice, protects my brushes nicely, and is fairly easy to keep clean.  It rolls up into a mostly flat rectangle shape that fits easily into my large make up case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the ordering and shipping process, everything went smoothly. I received the product in good condition, the brush set was just what I expected based in the product description, and it shipped here in about five days.</li>
    <li> Nice product i love it!!! I highly recommend this if u are a beginner because its (cheap + good quality + complete )</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush set! Such a great cohesive set for any makeup artist or beauty guru or makeup lover! I have other brushes that I have added to this collection but for the price you cant beat the quality. There isn&#x27;t a fluffy tapered blending brush and the kabuki foundation brush is pretty good but its not as dense as I like. The sigma f80 is a great replacement. If you are looking for a starter professional brush set this is definitely it. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I Purchased 6 of this set, putting makeup could not be any easier loool, soft brushes deliver in a short time in a great condition</li>
    <li> I love all the brushes.  one of the big brushes handle fell off (after a year of use) all I had to do was super blue it back on though and its fine now.</li>
    <li> Just got these brushes and I LOVE them. I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist but I love make-up and for personal use this definitely one of the best options for a good quality, affordable set. better than paying 20 or even 50 just for a single brush else where. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> The bag has a vety strong unpleasant smell, I left it outside for a day. That help reduce the smell. I am in love with the 2nd brush,  the flat buffer brush. I absolutely love it,  its the best brush in the whole set. I had all the small brushes, they are supper soft but shed a lot lot. The angled blush brush sheds like crazy,  I can&#x27;t use it anymore. All the brushes are soft though</li>
    <li> great brushes. Bought them 2 years ago and still use them. Great for any makeup style</li>
    <li> Love these brushes, work amazing and for the price!</li>
    <li> Ok this was seriously such a great buy! I recommend it to all my friends. The case it comes is very pretty and the brushes are very nice. I loved it, its such a good price.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that some brushes shed.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive face but these brushes work perfectly! These brushes are on par with high quality, expensive brushes without breaking the bank. They do the job and do not irritate my face!</li>
    <li> Great quality affordable brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! They&#x27;re soft and work really well. I&#x27;ve only noticed 1 or 2 bristles that have come out, but that&#x27;s it. The tops are pretty secure. I had to print my own reference picture and tape it to the case so that I could remember which brush was which. I do wish they had labeled them, but my solution works just as well.</li>
    <li> Very useful. Totally reeked when I first bought it, only has very light smell once I washed it and let it air out. Cheap, all-inclusive set</li>
    <li> Nothing beats the price. I wish they would label the brushes of what tyep of brush it is. But for the price, I am not complaining much.</li>
    <li> These brushes have definitely earned 5 stars! They are very dense and the brushes are EXTREMELY soft. Very easy to clean and there is just about every type of brush you might be looking for! For 34.95 the brushes well exceeded the quality I thought I would be getting. I would definitely recommend this product! The ONLY negative thing about this product is that the case they came in smelled a little funky at first, but lucky the brushes did not smell and the case eventually lost the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m even thinking about buying more as presents for my mom and sister. Absolutely love these &lt;3</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Arrived in neat packaging, upon opening the smelled chemically a little. Soaked them in brush cleaner and all is well. Totally Excited!!</li>
    <li> I recommend on these brushes&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and professionals :)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order 1 more to my mom also .</li>
    <li> Wow!!! Lucky deal for all who purchase. Amazingly soft, perfect variety and well put together (no shedding).  Comparable to major name brand brushes, these brushes are exceptional. You will not be dissapointed :) Yay!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised with how much I love these brushes! I am very passionate about makeup and do some professionally on the side, so I wasn&#x27;t to purchase a new, but reasonably priced, set of brushes. There were so many positive reviews for the Coastal Scents 22 Piece Brush Set that I just went for it and boy am I glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush set contains 22 brushes: 10 made from Pony hair, 4 made from synthetic hair, 4 made from nylon, 2 from fiber hair, 1 from goat hair, and 1 is made of rubber. All of the brushes are extremely soft and look/feel very high quality. I recommend, as does Coastal Scents, washing the brushes before use. Very little hair came out during washing and very little excess hair has come off since. I absolutely love the case. It folds up nicely containing all of the brushes and there was even a little bit of room for me to add some of my favorite single brushes (from other companies) to this set. I did notice a little bit of a smell with the case, it&#x27;s not too bad but just a kind of unpleasant &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; scent. I&#x27;m not sure how to get rid of this even after wiping it down a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint about this brush set is that these brushes are not numbered. I think they could have really &#x27;upped&#x27; the value of these brushes by adding numbers (like MAC and Stigma). In the product info, Coastal Scents lists the brushes by numbers (1-22) so that is how I will refer to them in this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite face brushes are #2, #3, and #5. I use #2, (Powder Buffer), on my neck and decolletage to blend my foundation. I love #3, (Round Powder) for contouring and highlighting. Its bristles are looser so it does not apply light and dark powders in a very concentrated way, which I like. And #5, (Angle Blush) is awesome for blush but it adds color in a concentrated way so only use a little powder at a time and really blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite eye brow brushes are #20 and #21. I use #20, (Large liner/brow), for lining up the shape of my eyebrow as well as filling it in with my brow powder. I love #21, (Medium liner/brow), for lining my concealer around the eyebrow to help shape it and give it a nice, clean look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite eye shadow brushes are # 9, #10, #13, and #14. For applying eyeshadow, especially multiple colors, I love using #14 (Detail Shadow) and #13 (Medium Shadow) for my inner eye. I then use #9 (Blender) to add accent colors, and #10 (Doe Foot Blender) is great for contouring and adding darker colors to your eye lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that overall this is a terrific value even if you only use half of the brushes. I definitely recommend this for beginning professional make-up artists on a tight budget as well as others who are passionate about makeup (&#x3D;for lining up the shape of my eyebrow as well as filling it in with my brow powder.

    <li> I was using Eco Tools before I received this brush set, and I must say I am very happy with the switch. I am also very happy with the case the brushes came in.  I think it is great to store in your bathroom and you can then toss it in your bag for on-the-go and it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  This set has every brush that I use to apply makeup and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  These brushes apply drugstore and name brand makeup very well.  The only Con I have is the smell of the brushes, it is not pleasant.  Though, after washing them the smell was gone. Very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this set to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got this set along with a SHANY brush set too, the brushes in this set that are colored black and white i believe there are 3 of them, they are the main brushes, and they feel like the barbie hair on barbie dolls? Too synthetic i don&#x27;t think they are natural hair brushes at all. the eyeshadow brushes are great but when the main brushes don&#x27;t really work the best it kind of sucks? the case however is lovely, but i don&#x27;t use the case to apply my makeup. also i wear bare minerals and the synthetic brushes don&#x27;t seem to do well with that type o make up?</li>
    <li> Was very iffy, bought it anyway and was very happy with it.  I use it every single day and not yet disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;(wash brushes before using!)</li>
    <li> Best brushes by far especially for blending!</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft. The angle blush brush shedded too much</li>
    <li> very good product, high recomended</li>
    <li> This set was better than I expected it to be for the price. Some of the brushes in this are actually quite nice. It&#x27;s perfect if you are just starting out with make up and want a good variety of brushes.</li>
    <li> A few of the brushes are excellent and I have no complaints about. However most of the blending brushes shed A LOT, even after washing the heck out of them to try and get all the loose fibers out.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smudge &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; (#19) and the stippling/kabuki type brushes. Also this item shipped way less than the expected delivery time!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush set, works well. Nice, soft material and cleans good too. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  They are soft and work well with my makeup.  They do not shed. I will definitely recommend these brushes to my friends and others.</li>
    <li> So i just receive the brushes today! I absolutely love them. They were not what i expected, they are better. They all come individually wrapped, the case has a pouch like storage that zips up for extra brushes or whatever you wanna put in there. The brushes smelled a little  when i first opened the package but it quickly vanished. All the brushes are really soft, i am in loveE with them!!!!!</li>
    <li> OMG... I am no professional, jst a person who loves making up. These brushes are amazing, it&#x27;ll be the third set I own, nd OMG it is the best, especially the powder brush... they are soooo soft. I honestly didn&#x27;t think the smell was that bad, shedding was not much as well. I thought the packaging was good nd it picks up product well without wasting any.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, they are great, i am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Good to go. The wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my brushes!!! These are all awesome and many of them are dupes for other brushes! I recommend these!!!</li>
    <li> I loved it , its really good it has all the brushes that you need for makeup, excellent quality, Good price</li>
    <li> I Love these brushes. When I first ordered them I was skeptical because most brush sets are poor quality. When I recvd. these in the mail I was very surprised. They are very dense. NO SHEDDING what so ever. I washed them when I first got them and you should and they still did not shed. I have had these brushes for a while now and NONE of the farrels have some loose and still no shedding. I am going to order an other set for my freelance kit. The only brush this set does to have is is a fluffy blending brush. I ordered one separate so its not a big deal. If you don&#x27;t  order this set you are missing out!</li>
    <li> Pretty good.  some of them shed but not all of them.  nice case too.</li>
    <li> when i first heard about your brush set i really really become so exited to try it one, but it really bad, the brush so thick and the hair coming off, i also find some Dust on it!!!! what is this really i&#x27;m very disappointed from you! i can&#x27;t use it it&#x27;s helpless :(</li>
    <li> This set is great and worth the investment but it&#x27;s NOT the best out there.</li>
    <li> This is a great set of brush for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first, but decided to make the purchase just because I wanted a full brush set and I have heard the brand coastal scents brought up in youtube make up guru&#x27;s videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it came before the expected arrival date&lt;br /&gt;second, the brushes were wrapped individually, looked like in was in a great condition.&lt;br /&gt;third, I was expecting the brush to shed after washing after reading one of the review, but it did not shed at all. one or two strands of hair on the angled powder brush did start hanging out so all i did was pull them out, other than that it was great&lt;br /&gt;last but not least, i left the brushes to dry, after it was all dry, the brushes still look good as new, no shedding, same softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the negatives:&lt;br /&gt;The brushes came smelling like vinyl? (cant think of a word for it) I was expecting this cause it is a new product&lt;br /&gt;The smell of did not so away completely after the first wash, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as before&lt;br /&gt;they could have included a sheet with the names/usage of each brush since there are more than one brushes for one purpose and it does get confusing even if you are familiar with make up brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got everything you need in great quality, and great price.</li>
    <li> Finally a case of brushes that isn&#x27;t super expensive. These brushes have held up perfectly for the last 6 months that I&#x27;ve had them. The case they come in is really nice and the variety of brushes is perfect for my needs. Happy with my purchase. Would buy from Coastal Scents again :)</li>
    <li> I brought this set because a few blogs said it was a good deal for quality and doesn&#x27;t shed. Untrue. Almost every brush I have used so far shed hairs on my face. I know it&#x27;s not that exp or a high end brand, but for almost $40, I wish they weren&#x27;t so junky.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptionally good brush set. I never realized the blush brush I was using before was reducing the vividness of my blushes. These brushes all pick up pigments very well so you&#x27;ll use a lot less product.  I wish there was a better fluffy blending brush though. Other than that this set is perfect.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money. So many brushes and they&#x27;re all so nice and soft. The brush roll is nice too, good for travel.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth brush set from coastal scents of the 22 Pc and I love it these ones have numbers on them not like the other coastal scents brushes I have ordered. I hope they hold up like my other ones.</li>
    <li> 80% of these brushes are good for practice or personal use I wouldn&#x27;t use most of these for professional use.   The best brushes are the fan brush, blending brush, smudge brush and crease brush... most of the other brushes are useless, (in my opinion) the rest of the brushes aren&#x27;t very soft and are difficult to apply makeup.  I was kind by giving it a 3. And that&#x27;s because of the few good brushes.</li>
    <li> I have purchased inexpensive brush sets before and this is by far the best. Very high quality. Would use them again.</li>
    <li> Thanks amazon! All brushes pictured were included and the outside of the box has pictures and labels for each brush.</li>
    <li> Very usefull and the prize is accesible</li>
    <li> The package came earlier than expected, super excited about that. Perfectly wrapped and came with guards to protect the brushes. Loving these brushes!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!  I was very nervous about ordering them because they are priced considerably less than some of the brushes I have used in the past, that they would shed quite a bit  So far I have not had any shedding.  I am so impressed.  The brush hair is very soft and not at all irritating to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been experiencing very sensitive skin lately as I am on a new skincare regimen and these brushes have been wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend these brushes for all individuals; novice and professional the same.</li>
    <li> I loved every single brush the only brush I did not use was the fan brush and the smudge brush. I am thinking of buying another set because my sisters took some of them already!</li>
    <li> Very Impressed!! Great for anyone looking for a nice quality set. My favorites r the face brushes especially the flat top</li>
    <li> This is a really, really good starter set for brushes.  I was initially apprehensive because the price seemed, &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; but this product was well worth the money.  Do yourself a favor and buy these brushes if you are in the market for them.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great quality for this price point! Have been using these brushes for the last year, and have experienced very little to no shedding! They are basically still in perfect condition, and I imagine will stay that way for some time! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup junkie with MAC and sigma brushes, but these were excellent. Just a little shedding</li>
    <li> Very good set for an inexpensive price. I love these brushes and they hold up very well. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I use them everyday, and for everything. The only problem I have with them is that some brushes are prone to fallout. This happens with Brush 05 when I&#x27;m applying blush I get the hairs from the brush on my face. Other than that they&#x27;re amazing!</li>
    <li> Great brushes!! Nice &amp; soft! I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance and ordered these they were just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for over a year now and they&#x27;re my favorite &amp;#34;budget-friendly&amp;#34; set of brushes. For the price, you get a lot of very good quality brushes. They&#x27;re pretty dense and they pick up product very well. The bristles are extremely soft and not scratchy at all. The flat top buffer brush is the softest brush in the set and it&#x27;s like heaven. Some brushes do shed a hair or two occasionally but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. The only brush missing from the set I think is essential is a tapered blending brush (Sigma E40/MAC 224 dupe). You can never have too many blending brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the case, I don&#x27;t use it, not even for traveling because I find it inconvenient to put all the brushes into each slot. I just throw all of my brushes into a separate makeup bag and I&#x27;m good to go. I don&#x27;t remember if they had a chemical smell or not when I first received them but even if they did, it was overshadowed by my excitement for the quality and quantity of brushes I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved these babies so much, I bought two additional sets when they were on sale to give to my sister and mom. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for the gf and she loves the set. I would definitely recommend the product and will be buying from them again</li>
    <li> Terrific brushes, great selections, amazing price.  I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase.  There are more brushes than I&#x27;ll actually use, but for the price it was fun to experiment with different brush styles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion would be the &amp;#34;standable-style&amp;#34; case.  However, the included case is also very nice!</li>
    <li> This piece is extreamly great quality. If you haven&#x27;t purchesed anything from coastal scents you will not be disappointed. Like all brushes make sure you clean them properly to maintain it&#x27;s shape and quality. Honestly this has everything you need so you don&#x27;t have to invest in any more brushes unless you need extras for some reason. Loving it!!</li>
    <li> i am pleased with my purchase. it arrived quickly. looks exactly like the picture. the bag it comes in is of a very good quality its leather, so it would last a long time and protect my brushes. i got this to use on my wedding day coz i didnt wanna go to any salons, i watched youtube videos and did my own makeup and it looked perfect, the brushes helped alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i gave it 5 stars coz its perfect quality for the price but though not as good as MAC brushes for sure but this whoel brushes set costs as much as 1 brush at mac, but are of a similar quality and better than all the drug stores and cheap makeup stores brushes for sure. you wont find this price for a good quality brush set in stores ever ever. the price is amazing, and the brushes do their job well.</li>
    <li> for beginners like myself its a great product and lots of options with the brushes....only downfall is they don&#x27;t have a numbering or labeling to them.</li>
    <li> That brush set is really good..i love that.</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice enough but the case look really cheap in my opinion. I&#x27;m wishing I had made another choice now.</li>
    <li> I ordered these Coastal Scent brushes after the Christmas and got it last week, this evening was the first time I used it, since washing and the powder and stippling brush worked well at applying and setting my foundation. The brushes washed well with little to no shedding except for the fan brush and the brush protector I had from bhcosmetics worked well for faster drying time.&lt;br /&gt;  These brushes are much softer than my USA travel size brushes and the case that came along with it gives it a professional flare!! The case itself had a plastic smell which took me awhile to narrow down, but I did *it smelled like new dolly* which was not offensive for me, because it reminded me of Christmas and childhood days..&lt;br /&gt;  I have not used every single brush as yet, the two mentioned plus angle, concealer,doe foot and 3 other for my eye shadow application.The ferrule is very securely attached, and the actual name of the brush is not printed on the item,...so i intend to copy,paste and download it.&lt;br /&gt;  This brush set is for any makeup enthusiast who wants an affordable but professional looking set thats not scratchy and actually works.&lt;br /&gt;  I certainly luv mines!!</li>
    <li> Glad I went with this set.  There are so many to choose from out there but what sold me on this was two brushes.  It comes with the Powder Buffer and Flat Stippling brushes. I love them.  Both great for liquid foundation.  Super coverage and flawless.  All the brushes are high quality and lovely.  Really soft and durable.  Handles aren&#x27;t going to come off on these babies.  Amazing bang for you buck.  Five stars here.</li>
    <li> I never go out of my way to write any reviews, but this product really deserves it. I am a beauty consultant and i know plenty about makeup brushes, and i know quality when i see it. This is the best purchase i have made in a while, i recommend to everyone to buy this brush set, and get rid of all the other brushes you have now, thats what i did. this set literally comes with every type of brush under the sun, im a happy customer.  ps. got shipped earlier than expected which is another perk.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my girlfriend.  She loves them.  Although not sure what to use all the brushes for, she is having a good time reading and watching vids on how to use them.  She says the quality is great!</li>
    <li> These brushes have densly packed bristles and are so soft!! I cannot believe they were only $32. Usually you get what&lt;br /&gt; You pay for but I prefer these over my sigma brushes!!</li>
    <li> This is the first brush set I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I&#x27;ve used it every day since I received it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;I even had a friend comment on it when I took it with me on a trip!</li>
    <li> I just got these today and I&#x27;m completely surprised. I usually get my brushes from E.L.F. and they&#x27;re ok for what you pay but they do fall apart if you wash them too much. The Coastal Scents brushes feel so sturdy and very dense. They did have a slight smell to them when i opened up the bag in comes in (really nice folding case) but i kind of expected that. just wash them and air out the case overnight, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem anymore. Anyway, Im not a professional makeup artist so these will just be for basic everyday makeup on myself. Im really happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Only problem is that there isnt a very good contour / bronzer brush that blends well</li>
    <li> Amazing quality brushes that are very affordable. I definitely recommend this brush set to anyone who loves makeup and doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much on a set of good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes r wonderfullly crafted. I can&#x27;t believe the low price. They r soft but steady. I know they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from another account. I admire the face brushes, not a big fan of the eye brushes. big selection of brushes, would&#x27;ve been better if there was more basic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it did have a smell, but it wasn&#x27;t strong, nothing irritating and the smell was soon gone.&lt;br /&gt;All brushes are very thick, not all of them are soft. face brushes, as in the first 6 ones are very good I really love the big due fiber one, I think they&#x27;re multitaskers, but i have a problem with the angled blusher brush, it started shedding after a while, and it got a bit harsh after a while which is a bit odd. The eye brushes are not that soft, some of them shed but not badly, I honestly expected them to be softer.&lt;br /&gt;this set has 2 concealer brushes, 3 fluffy basic eyeshadow brushes, 4 eyeshadow blenders, 3 angled brushes, and the rest, two angled ones would be more than enough, same as 2 blenders, one or 2 is enough basic eyeshadow brushes specially that the smaller one is almost the same size as the lip one.&lt;br /&gt;It would&#x27;ve been perfect if the eye brushes were a bit softer, and there was more basic brushes&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for starters, would be nice to add to your main collection. If you&#x27;re on budget you can do much better. And its always better to buy expensive brushes and budget friendly products than expensive products and cheap brushes</li>
    <li> For this price the brushes are amazing. Soft and you get a large amount of brushes!  The case smells funny at first but let it air out and it will be fine.  The brushes are holding up well so far, no hairs!!!</li>
    <li> This is hand down the best brush set I have ever owned. I still use several of the brushes including the flat top buffing brush which is my favorite! The bristles are soft yet they hold just a right amount of product. They do not scratch my skin nor they shed after countless times of washing them. The stipple brush is also a good one for liquid foundation. The fluffy eye shadow brushes are of very good quality! I will definitely repurchase this set or even better try out the elite set which looks promising as well :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been recently building my makeup wardrobe and needed a dependable set of brushes. I&#x27;m not one for spending unfathomable amounts of money on brushes, so I looked on Amazon for some good deals.  I actually used these brushes about a year ago when I borrowed them from my roommate and when I stumbled across them on Amazon, I had to have them. I am very, very pleased! The difference is very visible in my makeup. I look remarkably better because I finally have the tools needed for a proper application. My favorite is the foundation brush because, unlike others I have used, the brush is very dense and has made a drastic difference on the appearance and blending of my foundation. I would definitely recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great product, and I love the quality, especially as I tend to react to poor quality brushes, so these are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that I wish they labelled which brush is which, especially for novices like me.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this set 😊</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this set, easy to clean and it has just enough brushes to work wonders.  Brushes are natural and really soft even after wash.</li>
    <li> This is not a knockoff, it is THE original item! The brushes are so perfect! They are really dense and are perfect for makeup application! I use them on a daily basis and they work perfectly!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes after hearing many people rave about them. Let me just say this is a good kit, especially the price that you pay considering what you get. You get a lot of brushes!!! You should be able to create any makeup look and make it look quite nice as well. All of the brushes are soft, so very soft. These brushes are better than pretty much anything that you&#x27;ll find at stores like Ulta, Sephora, or even Walmart. (I literally tested all of their brushes lol) However, these are not high end brushes like MAC or Sigma, but they&#x27;re NOT, I REPEAT NOT AT ALL low quality brushes like E.L.F.. I own Sigma brushes and these do not compare to the quality and density of Sigma. But by no means am I saying that these are bad brushes, they&#x27;re quite good actually. They pick up make up well and apply quite nicely. The eye brushes are phenomenal, the face brushes- some are great, others are just okay. At $1.60 per brush, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main Face Brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat stippling- Okay, just okay. Very soft, but too soft and flimsy for application. Forces me to use more foundation than I would with my hands or a sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angle blush- Good. Nice and soft, but it could be denser. Picks up color well and applies just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large Round Powder/ Buffer- AWESOME!!!!!!! Great for anything, hands down!!! Never even seen a brush like this one. This brush retailer for around $17 by itself!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small Powder/ Buffer - eh, I didn&#x27;t like it, and it&#x27;s not the softest. I&#x27;m going to buy a different powder brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation Brush- Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A GREAT STARTER BRUSH SET, especially if this is your first brush set. After purchasing this , you really only need to buy speciality brushes for specific things. You won&#x27;t regret buying this set! :)</li>
    <li> WOW! it is still WOWing me. I really hate to put too much money on make up brushes from mac or sigma. This one is SUPER amazing . I mean it. it really is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s smooth&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not smelly AT all&lt;br /&gt;it does its job so WELL.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not loosing the hairs as they say may be one hair or two coz it&#x27;s glued firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend washing your brush Michelle Phan&#x27;s way.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you are looking for high quality brushes and save money to do other more important stuff.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and great so far I&#x27;ve only used them a few times but they are great. The bag does smell a little strong at first but if you air it out the smell goes away.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes as my first set there great just wish they came we something telling me what you use each brush for.. As I&#x27;m just learning how to apply makeup.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. These are high quality and a great deal. Everyone says I look perfectly airbrushed. Coastal Scents never fails me.</li>
    <li> Went to the company&#x27;s page and they were selling this set for 19.95 which honestly was a better price than whata I paid for. Cheap brushes they do the job but the eyeshadow just doesn&#x27;t stay in the brushes well. The hairs fll of and are all over my face when I&#x27;m done applying my makeup. It&#x27;s an alright but but overall I&#x27;m not to impressed :( I was hoping they would be be better quality.</li>
    <li> The brushes are awesome. All of the brushes are very soft, similar to eco brushes that you would find in department stores. The brushes are packaged well. Considering all of the brushes I got for the price I paid I would highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the BOMB DOT COM. I recieved them yesterday and couldn&#x27;t wait until this morning to do my makeup. Sure enough they made a huge difference in my makeup application. I have the Sigma brushes and wanted to try these as the reviews I have seen are really good. Now for the real test, I hope they last, but hey for the price what do you expect. So far these brushes are great for putting on your makeup and having a finish, polished and professional look. I recommend these for your stash.</li>
    <li> some of the brushes are not soft as i suspected but not all for them ..&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t recommend it except if you have no other choice</li>
    <li> Love them all worth the money.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. They are super soft and i have not experienced shedding. They do have a strong chemical smell upon arrival, but it quickly went away.</li>
    <li> I was so thrilled that it shipped so quickly. These brushes were in great condition when I received them. I used them the very next day and was super happy with how different my makeup turned out. I love how on the back of the Coastal Scents box it tells you what each brush does. It was a little hard to match some of the brushes because they were so similar but after a few minutes I figured it out. I definitely recommend this set. There were some reviews that made me think twice about ordering this but I&#x27;m glad I ordered it anyway.</li>
    <li> Bought them for my wife she loves them, there area couple that she said are a little to hard and she prefers her MAC but overall it was a great buy at a great deal.</li>
    <li> My set arrived today, like Amazon said it would, it was packaged nicely and I didn&#x27;t smell any bad plastic smell like some people say. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different brushes before but this is by far one of the best ones I&#x27;ve gotten for such a good price. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> came in fast and I absolutely love it! and for such a good price, the brushes are great, there&#x27;s a good variety too! and the case is a plus.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my aunt&#x27;s birthday because she&#x27;s always complementing me on my makeup and how airbrushed it looks... I use a mixture of MAC face brushes and the Shany cosmetics brush set (my first and only brush set).... I was about to  purchase another kit from Shany (already purchased about 5 as gifts for other family and close friends) when I saw this set advertised... I looked at the pictures and I knew RIGHT AWAY this was going to be a better buy because of the variety and style (duo fibre) of brushes!!! I was not completely interested in buying another Shany set because I specifically wanted duo fiber brushes and nice fluffly brushes because this is her FIRST set... .So I was about to buy a few of the necessary Sigma (face) brushes to go with a Shany cosmetic (25piece) UNTIL I SAW THIS GREAT BUY... GUESS WHAT ELSE??????!!!!! I purchased these in September and her birthday is in NOVEMBER! I simply could not have passed this offer up or afford for the brushes to go out of stock! And I am NOT DISAPPOINTEED at ALLLLLLLL..... I LOOOOVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEEE THIS SET!! The brushes (essential face brushes) are ALL there (foundation, powder, blush, buffing etc)!! They are comparable to my $30-45 a piece MAC BRUSHES, they are big and fluffy and soft! I was tempted to keep it for myself and order her another one until I realized I had no where to put all these brushes.. REALLLLLLYYY wished I bought this one first!! I KNOW she will LOVVVEEEE this kit as much as I do!!!</li>
    <li> Bought these for myself. They are pretty darn great. Im no pro but they seem to be pretty good quality at a great price. Would make a great gift! The bag is pretty nice too.</li>
    <li> I was so disgusted when I received the brushes. One of the brushes was USED - it had finger prints on it and when I ran my finger across the bristles, a big cloud of powder came out! GROSS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the brushes were poorly made. It looked like one of the brushes was glued together by a pre-schooler. When I took them out, they shed like crazy! Before I found the used one, I was picking hairs out of the brushes and I thought to myself... if I&#x27;m picking hairs out now, when they&#x27;re new, I can only imagine how much shedding will happen when I actually use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached pictures in case you wanted to see for yourself.... save you&#x27;re money folks!</li>
    <li> These brushes are decent quality, not outstanding, but they do the job.  The handles tend to come apart and need to be glued back  together, however, the bristles are great and otherwise, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I like certain brushes and some are cheaply made, but for the price and for a beginner it is good.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush set for my wife for Valentine&#x27;s Day. She originally asked for a brush set by MAC. Due to the expensive cost of MAC set brushes, I researched other/cheaper alternatives. I read the reviews about this brush set along with many others and found this had everything I was looking for. Not only was the price affordable but the set included many brushes and a nice case.&lt;br /&gt;After receiving this product and giving it to my wife, she was ecstatic and very excited to try her new brushes! After she used the brushes, she can&#x27;t say enough about how soft the brushes are. She absolutely loves ths set and to be honest I don&#x27;t think she feels bad, upset, or disappointed about not getting the MAC brush set. This is one of the best buys and choices I have made here on Amazon. Amazing value and an overall great product.</li>
    <li> this brushes are perfect.. soft, beautiful presentation and it came with brushes in every size.. i love the bag is made of leather</li>
    <li> This Brushes are so beautifull!! and the presentation looks so professional I love it! They are very soft to, I ave nothing bad to say about this product, great price and quality combination</li>
    <li> My package has arrived and I&#x27;m excited to start using my brushes I know I will love  definitely will be ordering more thanks amazon</li>
    <li> I love that this set includes a round buffer brush and tapered contouring brush! Brush sets rarely contain both and I was really happy to find a set that finally had both. If you don&#x27;t like the feel of synthetic brushes, then this probably isn&#x27;t for you because roughly half of the brushes are synthetic. I personally like that every brush has its own slot in the case. I took out some brushes that I don&#x27;t use and replaced them with a brow pencil, eyeliner, lash comb, etc. There&#x27;s also a zippered compartment where the fan brush is, which I love because I can put my mascara, Q-tips, and makeup wipes. Overall, it&#x27;s a fantastic set for a price you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed!!!! perfect perfect all perfect! wish i could give this 6 stars lol high quality and the brushes are amazing and very soft and stable texture!!</li>
    <li> It came in a timely manner. My only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the brushes didnt tell you exactly what each was for besides that they are quality brushes, Packaged well.</li>
    <li> Wife loved them! Says they&#x27;re soft and quality made. Easy to use and a great addition to add to her makeup collection.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat of a brush snob, but not really. I look for brushes that perform well and are worth the price. I have owned my Bobbi Brown brushes for nearly 2 decades and have never been sorry for the investment. They still perform WELL, but know that I take care of my brushes, regardless of cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing reviews for a variety of Coastal Scents products, including the buffing brush, I decided to throw caution into the wind and purchase the 22 pc brush set (I really didn&#x27;t need all 22 brushes...seriously...I have WAY too many brushes for someone who is NOT a makeup artist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes came in a really cool brush roll. It has an interesting odor, but nothing repulsive. I am sure that it will dissapate over time. The brushes themselves have no noticable odor. As a matter of fact, my recent MAC brushes (from the Nordstrom&#x27;s Anniversary Sale) had a detectable odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the brushes I have tried have performed as well as my high-end brushes. I have not noticed any hair loss after washing the brushes. I cannot say the same for my BE brushes. I can see taking this on my business trips instead of having a mish-mash of different types of brushes from different manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush set for both the novice and experienced make-up users. If you wonder how to use each brush, be sure to check out videos on the web for how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I would have liked to see was the brush number on each of the brushes. It&#x27;s not like they are trying to hide from the paparazzi, you know? They have Coastal Scents embossed on the handles, but not the brush number. Not sure why that is. That&#x27;s basically my only complaint...and it&#x27;s not even a complaint. More like a recommendation to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. Just remember to take care of your brushes, regardless of their price. If you take care of them, and they are properly constructed, they will provideyears of good service.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality brushes. Totally worth the price. I looked at cheaper sets but there were a lot of complaints about loose hairs in the bushes. I have not had this issue with this set and there is no weird smell to the brushes. In my opinion best set of complete brushes on amazon.</li>
    <li> I do make up and the brushes are very nice. You get almost every Brush you need for a make up application. Very soft as well made.. I highly Recommend them if your looking to by brushes!! And great price!</li>
    <li> Its a nice set and comes with probably more brushes than I will ever use.  I have had it for a year and all brushes are still good.</li>
    <li> I think this makeup brush set is a great value and the quality is good, Coastal Scents brand can definitely compete with some of the other top name brands out there. I also love that it comes with a nice leatherette case, this is a great starter set for the amateur make up artist. I&#x27;ve purchased make up palettes as well thru them and I love the richness and variety of colors they offer.</li>
    <li> They are really nice and soft I really like them a lot all though I have not use them all yet I can&#x27;t complaint I really like them.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what i thought it would be. You cant easily find this kind of quality for such a great price.</li>
    <li> It was quickly shipped and arrived within a week.&lt;br /&gt;There is a new smell to is but I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are extremely soft and branches stay in contact.&lt;br /&gt;The stick itself is sturdy, clean, you can tell the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;I know what 80% of what the brushes are used for,. the rest are clueless,&lt;br /&gt;Everything is exactly the same as you see in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely picky about my brushes and make-up products but this set here is 99% lovable. Its affordable and worth the price.. As picky as I am, trust me you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. Very smooth for makeup application. They feel like professional brushes that I have had used on me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my brushes I didn&#x27;t have to waitI can&#x27;t wait to put it in another order I recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> These are very good brushes for a price I paid. The briscles are really soft and don&#x27;t shed. It would be nice though, if they put brush numbers or description on each of the brushes.</li>
    <li> I received my brushes today and I&#x27;m still shocked at how great the quality of the brushes are compared to the price. If you are considering purchasing this set do not hesitate! I can&#x27;t get over how soft the bristles are and how great my make up looks. This is my first experience with Coastal Scents and needless to say I am impressed!</li>
    <li> This Makeup set is amazing. Everything I could have asked for. I am a makeup artist and I know when bruses aren&#x27;t that great. But this makeup set is seriously amazing. Don&#x27;t look for anything else!! BUY THIS. You literally wont regret it. My Makeup comes out so smooth and blended thanks to this set. You can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
    <li> - Great quality brushes&lt;br /&gt;- Awesome for beginners&lt;br /&gt;- Sometimes I wish for a slightly bigger or smaller brush than the given options&lt;br /&gt;- Geared more towards eyes than face&lt;br /&gt;- The case material is kind of cheap. It&#x27;s decent but slightly flimsy but good enough.&lt;br /&gt;- Brush guards are a nice addition&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t put on a white shelf, the packaging/holder/case because the shelf&#x27;s paint will peel off and stick to the case.</li>
    <li> 95% of the brushes are amazing, a few look cheap. But hey the price for them was really good. A few of them are good enough quality to be worth at least $15 each at a store. Make sure to wash them properly as soon as you get them, they do smell a little of plastic and packaging material. The price was great for the purchase!</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing! the only bad thing is that I wish it came with an actual powder brush not a stippling one.</li>
    <li> There are not any labels so if you are not an expert like me you are left wondering what the brush is called and what is it used for? I can&#x27;t even google what it does because I don&#x27;t know the name of that particular brush. I just experiment and so far I think the brushes themselves are great but there are so many I have no idea how to use all of them.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT HOPING THIS WAS A COMPLETE SET OF VARIOUS FACE BRUSHES TO ADD TO MY KIT, I WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL IN BUYING THIS BECAUSE I BOUGHT ANOTHER SET OF A DIFFERENT BRAND ON AMAZON TO SOON FIND OUT WHEN PRODUCT ARRIVED THAT A LOT OF THE BRUSHES WERE THE SAME BUT IN DIFFERENT SIZES. BUT NOT THIS KIT, IT MANY DIFFERENT BRUSHES FOR DIFFERENT USES, BRUSHES WERE SOFT THEY WERE BETTER THAN MY CURRENT SET, AND HAD A FEW NEW BRUSHES TO ADD TO MY EXISTING COLLECTION. I was looking for a set like the Mac SET the ladies use at the Mac counter and this was far the best SET like it without the perfect tag. I would highly recomment this, to anybody looking for a complete brush set trust me you will nor regret the purchase, I am so pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the first Coastal Scents brush set that I&#x27;ve purchased, and I just couldn&#x27;t pass them up for the price. I&#x27;m going to be studying abroad this semester and I wanted to get a good quality set that is going to last while I travel. It arrived right on the estimated delivery date and the package was wrapped very securely. The leather pouch holds all 22 brushed very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are great and help apply my makeup very smoothly and the different brushed let me do lots of different looks. They are easy to clean and maintain. However when I first received them, I noticed that the brushes shed a few bristles. It&#x27;s not a big deal because it wasn&#x27;t so many, but it makes me worried whether they&#x27;ll withstand harsh cleaning or multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this set. I&#x27;ve heard many great things about them and I was not all disappointed.</li>
    <li> This brush set is very good.I was very impressed with the quality of these brushes. I was explecting them to be about as good as the E.L.F. brushes at Wal-Mart,  but these are MUCH better. I would say this set ranks above drugstore quality, but below high-end quality. I find that I reach for these every day since they have arrived. I give these brushes 5 stars because you get good quality brushes for the money you spend. (What? $1.40 per brush? Not bad!!!) Very wonderfully priced for the quality. I am not going to degrade the number of stars on this product because I feel like I definitely get my money&#x27;s worth of what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind they are not, however, better than my higher end brushes from sophora and Bare Minerals, but that&#x27;s okay. I was in search for some eye brushes to add to my collection. When I stumbled upon these, I was a bit hesitant to spend $40 on a set of brushes that I was unsure about, but I figured that in a set of 22 I was bound to find a few that I like. I was right! I love the shadow brushes because they are soft and fluffy. The flat buffer brush works almost and good as my Urban Decay optical blurring brush. I could care less for the enormous fan brush, tiny sponge applicator, and set repeatitive angled brushes, but I&#x27;m sure I can find a use for all of them eventually.</li>
    <li> I loooove these brushes!! they are fine quality and work miraculously!! I recommend totally!! I will buy me another :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are good but i would have liked a flat shatter brush, one of the brushes came in and it was broken, its an okay pallete maybe for beginners</li>
    <li> Very good product as shown</li>
    <li> I like these alot the hair is nice they clean well but just a few have come unglued but it is an easy fix with glue. Nice quality.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set few weeks ago and yesterday i tried them for the first time. Im amazed i didnt expect that these brushes as a profficional one. Easy to use and clean, comes in many shape and size and all in a black leather case. Im in love with my new brushes ♡</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely pleased with rios set!! Amazing detailed brushes and blending brushes the only types of brushes it doesn&#x27;t come with are good eye shadow blending brushes.. Every brush I love though!! The brush holder is sturdy and amazing also</li>
    <li> The quality of these brushes is amazing considering the price. I have bought more expensive name brand brushes that were not as good as these brushes. The brushes are very soft and pick up the right amount of color. The brushes do not shed like some of the natural bristle brushes I have.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, but decent brush set, keep looking (I&#x27;d recommend ELF brushes). Half the brushes shed, and the synthetic-haired brushes are so low quality, they&#x27;re unusable.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit a week ago and since then all the brushes were shed like crazy. I am so disappointed with the quality of this product.  Do not recommend at ALL.</li>
    <li> I really love this set of brushes and it&#x27;s very convenient with the case they come in</li>
    <li> These brushes are definitely a good addition to my collection. They are built well and don&#x27;t shed.  Overall, I enjoy them! Good for a starter kit.</li>
    <li> So far, so good- but so many brushes that are unnecessary for the average person- just so you know.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so soft! and they work so well with blending. I love them</li>
    <li> They arrived in a coastal scents box , neatly packaged and protected inisde. The brush case has an additonal storage compartment right underneath the fan brush that can store additional items if needed., The brush pockets are wide enough to store up to two brushes (depending on the brush handle width of course) at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest cleaning your brushes before your first use (I use a 99% anti bacterial soap with a olive oil to keep the brush bristles from drying out, while i clean them under luke warm water), although they&#x27;re well secured and glued into the handle, I advise to always keep water from entering the handle by cleaning them with the bristles facing downward. I did notie that while cleaning the brushes a few bristles came off (as to be excpected) but nothing too alarming or outside of the &amp;#34;norm&amp;#34;. Other bruses seemed to have a black dye or powder that came out while cleaning them for the first time, as if the brush had been previously used on black eyeshadow or something. I am not sure what that was about, but I am very please witht the overal quality of the brushes and have purchased a second set as a gift for my best friend.</li>
    <li> No powder brush but that was quickly over looked as soon as I touched these brushes. You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great price! At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if they were going to be of good quality. However, I realized that they are just as good as sigma brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try these brushes out, u won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
    <li> What a difference a good brush set makes in your make up application!  I&#x27;m a performer but no make up expert, and I finally decided to find some better brushes.  This brand was recommended to me in lieu of more expensive brands like MAC and Sigma.  I am very pleased with them.  They pick up a good amount of color and aren&#x27;t messy in the application.  They blend very nicely and feel soft on my skin.  Like many others I am in love with the flat buffer brush, as I mostly wear powder foundation and it&#x27;s perfect for that.  The giant fan brush is great for dusting shimmer mica over my face and body.  I&#x27;m not a professional who puts brushes to heavy use, so I can&#x27;t say if they are that kind of quality.  For a light daily application and weekend performance make up application they are working very well.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! the hair are so soft, for this price it&#x27;s totally worth it!!!And all my roomies love it too!!</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for a good price. I used the set for my wedding make up. Had it for a year now and it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
    <li> This Brush Set is Beautiful! I bought to my sister in Brazil, She is a professional  and she love It!</li>
    <li> I loved this brush set! They are high quality brushes especially for the price! Has all the brushes you could ever need in one kit! Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> A brush for anything and everything! Soft brushes. And durable 2 2 piece set. Applies make up great as well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are high quality and for the price its pretty awesome i bought one for me &amp; my mom bought one too but I bought mine a year before i think the price went up but I still think it&#x27;s worth it. At mac you get like 1 brush for 30$ so you get a bunch of brushes and a pouch! Id recommend this for anyone</li>
    <li> Product was in great shape, shipped very fast even though it was expected to be delivered a week later. The box the case and brushes came in was open which was the only downfall but everything else was perfect.</li>
    <li> Two thumbs up! Although I haven&#x27;t tried all of the brushes, I love the ones I&#x27;ve tried so far (the large powder brush and the kabuki brush). The kabuki brush blends my liquid foundation onto my face so well! Def a great buy for a great deal!</li>
    <li> My brushes arrived coated in a very weird silky white powder that I had to clean off, but other than I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I don&#x27;t do makeup daily and I haven&#x27;t used but a couple brushes, but I like the ones I&#x27;ve used so far and enjoy all the different sized brushes.</li>
    <li> It had every brush you need! I love them. Only reason why I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because they shed.</li>
    <li> Great quality; superb application. In my opinion, the best non-professional makeup bush set available. Wish each bruch were numbered. Makes a great gift!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love loved!!! my coastal scents brushes, they dont break down easily and they last a long time with good care.(:</li>
    <li> These brushes dont get a full 5 stars because of the smell, i thought it wou;d go away after a while, but it hasnt and its really strong. If you can get past that the brushes work great, love that I can keep the organized in one place.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy, some of the brushes did shed some, however they seem to get the job done and some of them I use more than my Sigma and Mac brushes. I was overall satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> I was really not sure what brush set to order... I&#x27;m glad I got these brushes! The travel case is great and very functional. I love all of the brushes! I do wish there was a big foundation brush but that is the only one I was missing. I have been able to tell such a different in how my makeup look after I started using these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first set of REAL brushes I&#x27;ve bought. They are really soft and pick up the makeup really well especially for eye shadow. There was not a list of what the brushes were used for, but I went online and found one. I washed them when I first got them. There was hardly any loose bristles.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend getting these brushes!</li>
    <li> Perfect brushes!  I love them. Hairs don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of time researching makeup brushes and trying to find a good quality set for a reasonable price. After reading a lot of the reviews, I decided to give these a try and I do not regret it! There is such a variety of brushes that it&#x27;s easy to create all kinds of looks. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them to anyone looking to buy affordable brushes.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Brush Set! ♡</li>
    <li> Were very soft, even before I washed them! I love the eye smudge brushes, which is why I got this set. All in all, I am very satisfied. Based on other brushes that I&#x27;ve had, these pick up the color much better, and also spread it much better.</li>
    <li> Great price for so many brushes! Makes for a great gift. Now I can do more with my makeup. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am a freelance make-up artist. I absolutely love what this kit has to offer! Great quality! I can easily cleanse the brushes with no issues. Fully recommend this to any one and it has everything anyone would need.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any repeat brushes , easy to clean, none of the hair has fallen out on me. I just love this! Easy to use for a professional &amp; even a beginner that just loves makeup</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a decent set of brushes on a budget then you must pick up this set from Coastal Scents! Great carrying case and a brush for every need.</li>
    <li> used for the first time yesterday....awesome quality :) for the price will get plenty of use now that i am learning with great brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I only have one negative about it and it&#x27;s only a brush or two that shed. But other than that they&#x27;re soft and amazing on application. My favorite is the flat top brush for foundation application. I recommend to buy these if you&#x27;re on a budget but you still want to look amazing ;) it arrived before expected as well!</li>
    <li> Did a lot of research on brush sets. This set is very nice for the money.  Will be ordering one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I&#x27;m in the beginnings of makeup artistry, I&#x27;m trying to find reasonably priced item for my kit that are still good quality. These brushes actually exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve shown them to my friends, and several of them (including some of the &#x27;brush-snobs&#x27; want to buy the set. Buy them! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> These are really nice brushes. No shedding and very soft. I definitely recommend them to anyone that loves doing makeup. They are a great value as comparable brushes are more than $100. I think they are well worth the price. The case is great too. It has magnetic snap closures which make it easy to close and put away in a jiffy.  If you need the brush names go to coastal scents website and they have a list of the names so that you can match the number in the picture to the number next to the name. Then you can take a fine point paint pen and write the name on the brush. That&#x27;s what I did and it helps to keep track until you can recognize them by sight.</li>
    <li> After reviewing several makeup brush sets, I decided on this one as it contained most of the brushes recommended for makeup application. It also contained a mixture of materials both natural and synthetic, as appropriate for applying dry or cream/liquid makeup.  When the set arrived I was very happy with it. The brushes are full and soft. The brushes are securely attached to the handles, which are easy to hold and use. I washed them with brush shampoo and had zero fallout. I was very impressed with the brushes when I used them. I feel they perform as well as high end brushes. The only critique is the case smells, but that has dissipated and there was no list of brush names. I was able to get that information from the listing. Overall, I thought this was a great value.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for the low price...I use these brushes everyday and they are very soft, I expected them to be low quality but they are great!</li>
    <li> First off WOW! The quality of the brushes and the case are fantastic. 22 pieces is more than I know what to do with but I&#x27;ll figure something out. Each brush is soft and has a long handle. Some are made with synthetic hair and some with real, so they wont all feel the same but still soft. The case was bigger than I had imagined it would be and is very durable. These brushed pick up product and blend as well as any higher end brush with the exception of Mac/Sigma. If you&#x27;re looking for a complete set to have for yourself or to give as a gift I highly recommend this set. The brushes are not labeled or numbered, it could be confusing if you do not know what a brush does. I will provide a link to a youtube video of one of my favorite beauty gurus that goes over what kind of makeup brush does what. ** [...] ** The price is great for the product and I will repurchase. I washed my brushes prior to use and didn&#x27;t have any issues with any fallout.</li>
    <li> It does the job. the bristles are soft. sometimes i feel like the brush is bigger than my eyelids. It would be nice if they had more blending brushes though.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set perfect texture the quality is amazing picks up product fabulously distributes onto to skin very well the case is very good quality as well. Definitely my favorite brush set by far and the price was a steal</li>
    <li> I you are like me and are getting into make up , one of the things you&#x27;ll notice is that brushes are essential. I bought a set of these for myself and one for my daughter. The price is terrific and the collection is more than enough.</li>
    <li> The brush set complements the Coastal Scents Neutral Palette I purchased for my niece. She may consider other color palettes</li>
    <li> Thay are great, really helps me with the tought lines, however some of the hairs come off, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these!! They are so soft and they blend perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Y BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVE IT. SHE FEELS VERY HAPPY WHIT THIS BRUSHES THEY ARE VEEEERY SOFTLY. I RECOMEND THIS ITEM IT CAME TO MY HOUSE ON TIME.</li>
    <li> Nice set for price....pretty decent. They were packaged very neatly. This is my first set and I&#x27;m happy with them....after reviewing for hours...lol</li>
    <li> Price is great&lt;br /&gt;Would give it 5 stars But there is some shedding with some of the brushes. Not sure if it was cause after being wash or not. Cause I wash them when I first receive them before use them. The shedding isn&#x27;t that bad.&lt;br /&gt;Still good for that price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price; I am not a professional however I use a lot of makeup products and have learned a lot about doing makeup over the years and I see you get what you pay for with this; as with anything. Great price for this many brush options but I was disappointed in the shedding. If you are a regular woman just doing day to day makeup I would recommend the ELF line and you can get all that at target. It does come in a schnazzy leather case that snaps closed for travel so that&#x27;s what&#x27;s up.</li>
    <li> excellent brushes for the price you will not be disappointed in this purchase. a lot of brushes and quality is there.</li>
    <li> Comes with every brush you could need. Planned on buying a more expensive set for my sister but she said this is the best brush set she has bought.</li>
    <li> good quality brushes for a cheap price! Must buy! I love to use these for brushes for traveling. The only thing i would complain is these brushes don&#x27;t have a label or a number.</li>
    <li> I used these brushes when I was first really getting into makeup. They&#x27;re decent quality for the price, Some of the brushes are not as dense as I would like but they&#x27;re reasonably soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding.</li>
    <li> My brush set is falling apart. Will not be buying these agin unless they are replaced by the company.</li>
    <li> Great brushes and case!</li>
    <li> There is nothing bad i can say about this brushes... they all work well... there is no shadding at all...</li>
    <li> I bought these instead of springing for another 100$ set from sigma, I&#x27;m really impressed! Soft and no fallout! Definitely buying another couple sets as back up</li>
    <li> Great brushes, love the blush one especially. Wish they were marked on the brush what they were for, info pack on techniques</li>
    <li> Coastal Scents!!!? Always Excellent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase! Cero complains.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly! this brand is always great.&lt;br /&gt;Everything coastal scents i buy is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended! :D</li>
    <li> It was delivered very fast without paying more to get it.  The brush are excellent and the package contains what you need to work with make up.</li>
    <li> Good to use .Thanks. will  order more. Build quality can be improved.material can be voloured to give it a good design</li>
    <li> you have to clean them before you used them because some of them has some hair&lt;br /&gt;so far so good am happy with them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed!! especially the face brushes amazing:)</li>
    <li> The brushes are really good the only thing is they shed when  you wash them especially when you get them</li>
    <li> This blush set is the best set I have ever purchased and believe me I have spent a pretty penny on blush sets.  It has everything you could need or want, the bristles do not come off on your face, they feel soft and smooth, and leave an excellent finish on your skin!  Don&#x27;t look around...just get this set..you wont be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not the best but a great price for the amount of brushes you get. If you&#x27;re young or just starting off with make up then this is perfect. But if not, I&#x27;d invest in a better brand.</li>
    <li> This is the ideal brush set for anyone who is truly in to makeup. There&#x27;s a brush for absolutely everything!&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with others that the brushes initially have a strong chemical smell but that is easily remedied with a wash before first use. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with shedding or brush density.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set, especially for the price. Similar sets could easily cost $200-$300.</li>
    <li> Loved the brushes the leather pouch was bigger than I thought it would be which was a plus...the brushes were all there in place with protective wrap over them so they wouldn&#x27;t get damaged. If your looking to start training for doing make up I would absolutely recommend this item:)</li>
    <li> I received these brushes from my husband as an anniversary gift. He knew I had been looking an extremely long time for a brush set; and well, the brushes I was looking at were just a bit out of our price range. I was excited when I got these because they were basically what I was looking for (the only thing missing was a flat top kabuki brush). Fast forward three months later, one of the brush&#x27;s tops came off. It looked like the glue wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep it on the handle. Fast forward another three months, another top came off. I glued both of them back onto the handle, but I&#x27;m sure the rest will do that because they&#x27;re a cheap brush set. One thing I don&#x27;t like at all is the blush brush. Whenever I use it, parts of the bristles sit on my face. I have to pick them off of my cheeks one by one. That gets super annoying. I would say the best brush in this set is the fan brush for highlighter. Some of the smaller shadow brushes are nice, but if you&#x27;re looking for a really good brush set to last you a while and you&#x27;re an advanced makeup artist or do your makeup everyday (like me), then you probably want to look for an alternative set. I plan on saving up a little more money and slowly but surely trading out each of these brushes with another brand.</li>
    <li> I Love all the brushes... Great variety ...especially the face brushes! Would recommend for a cheap brush set! Great deal!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this brush set after reading such positive reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and can honestly say it&#x27;s just OK. I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist or anything but just an average user but I wasn&#x27;t impressed by the bristles at all. One of the powder brushes is already coming loose and seems like it&#x27;ll break off the handle really soon. Also, the handles are pretty long so for those who get real close to a mirror, try not to poke your face. The price is right but I plan to purchase more expensive brushes in the near future.</li>
    <li> This was my first professional brush set. LOVE IT I love doing my make up every morning now. Pair it with good makeup and you&#x27;ll really see the difference from starter kit to professional look.</li>
    <li> Very amazing brush set. The case did have a funky smell right when it came, but the smell declined after being aired out. The brushes are amazingly soft, and made me very happy. Very high quality, definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Exceeded expectation, I truly would highly recommend it... I bought it for my daughter and now will purchase one for me!</li>
    <li> i love love love these brushes! as a make up artist, i need more than one set of brushes for big events and these are just what i needed.</li>
    <li> great beginner set... BUT some of my brushes detached. i have had the brushes for almost 6 months, and my only complaint is that they are not the best quality; some of my brushes detached. you&#x27;ll need super glue to re-attach.</li>
    <li> I wanted a set of brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of dollars for a good brush set. After reading all the good reviews about these brushes I thought I would try them. They are a very good set of brushes for the price, I have not had any of them shed. The only thing I wish was in the set is a good fluffy blending brush other than that I would say a good investment for someone who wants a full set of brushes but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
    <li> are they imitation ? or original ?</li>
    <li> I love them !!!!! Did have a smell but washing them took care of it. Overall Very affordable for 22 brushes pluse there &#x27;re really soft and blends makeup very nicely.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with these brushes. This set contains every brush you will ever need. And it is VERY good quality for the money. I was very impressed with this set. Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a professional collection of brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this set... and so does my daughter because she keeps taking it from me.  Solid brushes that are soft.</li>
    <li> I just received this set today and I am happy to say I am very impressed. They are very very soft and I can&#x27;t wait to use them. I bought these because of how much I loved the Color me Fushia 5 piece set. They clean up so easily and maintain their shape. There has been no shedding either. I wish I had bought this a few months ago. I think this is a great  kit for anyone just starting a brush collection as well as completing one.</li>
    <li> All the brushes were there and none of them have fallen hair. They are really soft brushes and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set. There are great quality. They are soft, have a very minimal amount of shedding, they are nice and full, and they DON&#x27;T FEEL CHEAP. If you have ever bought an inexpensive brush set and the brushed where hard and did not blend well, you know what I mean. I have alot of favorites in this set.&lt;br /&gt;I have a few MAC brushes and sigma brushes, which are great quality but VERY pricey, and these work JUST AS WELL.&lt;br /&gt;This set it perfect as a starter kit or for anyone that just doesn&#x27;t want to skip the cell phone bill this month just to pay for some make-up brushes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honesty can&#x27;t think of a con, except that I wish Costal Scents had other brush sets for this price with different brushed.</li>
    <li> Love them all. Great material, great price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic.  I would give it five stars, except for two things: I wish the brushes were labeled.  There are so many, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to know which is which at first glance.  Secondly, they tend to fall out of the case rather easily.  Otherwise, they&#x27;re fantastic  I don&#x27;t need any other brushes!</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup brushes that I have ever used. Great quality and price.&lt;br /&gt;Soft&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;Easy to Clean</li>
    <li> This set is a must for your collection. The brushes are of very high quality and worth so much more than the price. I must admit I was skeptical about the quality of the brushes for the price. After reading the rave reviews I decided to purchase and do not regret my decision. I&#x27;ve only used a few in the week since my purchase but so far I am very pleased. You cannot beat this price! I&#x27;ve seen one brush for more than the total of the set. Coastal Scents you have outdone yourselves with this product. Thanks for a GREAT product at an unbelievable bargain.</li>
    <li> For the price, these brushes are great. The case that they come in is nice too. I have noticed that some of the hairs are already falling out, but I was kind of anticipating that. For someone like myself who is still trying to get the hang of using makeup in general, this set is a go-to.</li>
    <li> Is not good enough, hair falling out when to use them.</li>
    <li> WARNING!&lt;br /&gt;Some of these brushes are NOT worth the money you&#x27;re paying for them. Some of them work great. For example the face angled brush and eye rubber smudger are completely useless. The face angled brush loses its shape right after you first wash it, not only that but it sheds like CRAZY (as well as the second brush to the right) it has a very unpleasant smell to it. Almost like horse hair. Once it&#x27;s dry and ready to use it performs poorly since the bristles are no longer in the shape they were when they arrived. I am VERY disappointed with some of these brushes. However, there are some that I really like and am happy to have bought. I would say 40% of these brushes shedded when I washed them. Although most of these come handy when applying your makeup, I find the ones made of pony hair very hard to work with since the bristles literally SUCK! BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU&#x27;RE BUYING. If none of this bothers you, girl go right ahead and buy this set, but if you&#x27;re constantly having to do people&#x27;s makeup and wash your brushes just as much as I do then this is only worth half the money.</li>
    <li> There are a few really good brushes here... particularly #4 and #6, but most of them shed way too much to the point where they&#x27;re unusable. Some have very sparse hair and uneven lengths of hair as well. I don&#x27;t regret buying them because of how great the two brushes I mentioned are, though.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and they blend well, but they shed terribly. I think they&#x27;re good value for the price though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush set! I was quite surprised with the quality of them for being so inexpensive! I have already recommended them to several friends and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the blush set.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes love then so much!!! So happy I got these very good quality I use them everyday (:</li>
    <li> Love this brush set. The quality is great and the price is a steal!!</li>
    <li> I lovee these brushes! They&#x27;re very soft and EASY to blend, they don&#x27;t have any weird odors or any problems, they came in a very strong case and I love them :)</li>
    <li> Great long lasting brushes for the price. Great deal!</li>
    <li> Very cool product and purchased Recommend</li>
    <li> Perfect price for this starter kit of brushes.</li>
    <li> Nice brush set. Brushes are soft and give a great finish to make up applications.</li>
    <li> This is my first brush set- and I love it, it&#x27;s amazing how much of a difference having good brushes can make! These are very soft and don&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. Everything was packaged nicely and the case is even better than I expected it to be! I will be buying more products by Coastal Scents in the future!</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and my friend loved it. She did say that one of the brush handles broke off, but other then that, she liked the rest of the brushes.</li>
    <li> The brushes are super soft and decently priced. Not to mention, they are holding up very well so far. The only thing I wanted that it didn&#x27;t have was an eyebrow/lash brush and comb combo.</li>
    <li> Good set for principiants. They do not smell at all. The brushes are soft and make up perfectly. Great buy</li>
    <li> I have been looking at makeup brushes for awhile now, but always hesitated at the super high price tags!  I finally just decided on this brush set because it was so affordable and seemed to get good reviews on here &amp; by beauty bloggers on Youtube.  Well, I got my brushes and I love them!  They are super high quality and have the look/feel of many of the expensive brushes I have considered.  I&#x27;ve had cheap brushes before and these brushes are NOT cheap!  The heads all feel secure...I pulled and wiggled them all and didn&#x27;t find any loose ones.  The bristles are so soft and feel like natural hair brushes.  There is also plenty of variety amongst the different brushes, so you will always have the right brush for the job!  From foundation to eyeshadow to liner....you&#x27;re set with this kit!</li>
    <li> This brush set has been a lifesaver. I have had it for a year and I don&#x27;t use all the brushes but the ones I do I absolutely love. Little to no shedding with these and I&#x27;ve washed them multiple times since I am a clean freak. They are soft and durable. Also very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This a great brush set for the money. It has a good variety of brushes. Can&#x27;t loose for the price.  I have sigma and Mac brushes, and I am so very satisfied with this kit.  I love the face brushes especially. I bought this kit for the fan brush, but I found favorites in others.</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes for the price,  nice quality</li>
    <li> The brushes are super soft. There is a slight acrylic smell to the case when you pull it out, but honestly I don&#x27;t really mind the smell. It&#x27;s a bit strong if you aren&#x27;t used to it, but anyone who&#x27;s bought an art kit wouldn&#x27;t be bothered at all by the scent. These are an AWESOME product for the price, with little to no shedding upon washing. This set is better than any other brush set I&#x27;ve owned in my life, definitely recommend! You will not regret throwing out those tiny little sponge applicators!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no makeup artist but I love makeup. This is a very good set to fill in all the in-betweens you might need for new shadow applications. Or for the days you just don&#x27;t have time or want to clean a brush or two. I did not give it 5 stars because you do have some loose hairs on the Bronzer or blush brushes. And YES the case stinks but as it is not leather that is to be expected. So if you plan on storing them in the case look for a plan B like a brush holder. I suggest the Lumsing Large wavy acrylic brush holder it&#x27;s just the thing..</li>
    <li> not only do i love my brushes but i could not be more pleased with how quickly i recived my product ! within one day it was at my door step ready to be used which was perfect timing for when i needed them ! the quality and packaging was great ! thank you so much</li>
    <li> these brushes are wonderful! they are extremely soft and the hairs don&#x27;t fall off. i would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes. It is as described. The brushes are soft, no shedding when washed. it does the job well.</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSHES! I HAVE USED THEM FOR YEARS AND THEY WASH GREAT!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!!! so glad I brought them!! I use them everyday.. so easy to clean also.. ........ :)</li>
    <li> Great collection of brushes. I thought it was a good price, they aren&#x27;t too quality, but you can pay for one brush what I paid for all if you go to Mac etc. Reasonably soft. I&#x27;d reccomend cleaning before using.</li>
    <li> i love these brushes my mom loves them when i do her makeup and thy dont shed at all and they put on makeup so good for the price  there really good ..there pretty cheap cuz if u go to cosmetics brushes there like $21 for one brush</li>
    <li> You can get these on sale or in kit for much cheaper on the website. The Duo Buffer brush is the best and the smaller duo fiber - they are my favorite. The Duo Buffer ended up shedding after awhile and so did the flat top but I think I got water in the ferrule. I think this is great if you want to try out a lot of brushes. I see some kits that don&#x27;t have true face brushes, normally a powder brush and the rest eye brushes. Most never lose hair and some lose a hair or two. Overall I love this kit. I just wasn&#x27;t bid of the fan brush - maybe cause I didn&#x27;t know how to use it. Great beginners kit. I am really impresses I am going to repurchase the Classic Buffer(duo fiber large), maybe the flat top and the small duo fiber. Everything I have and use regularly expect the fan brush - my son lost.</li>
    <li> I was pretty impressed with these brushes for the price. My only dislikes are the eye brushes. They&#x27;re a bit flimsy, but the face brushes work great. Overall I think it&#x27;s a good buy. I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> i received it fast and the quality is great for the price i would recommend  it if you are just starting it, has all you could need for a beginner</li>
    <li> I love the quantity and quality of brushes for the price. The downside there&#x27;s no number identification or brush type listed on the brush. So there&#x27;s no way to tell someone the kind of makeup brush you used to apply/blend your eye shadows, blushes etc. Overall, good buy for brushes and the case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what the deal is with the reviews regarding the fumes and what not? this brushes for the price are fantastic.. kabucki brush and the range of shader brushes are on par with Mac..really great buy.. I&#x27;m going to buy these as gifts for friends!</li>
    <li> I really love these brushes so I bought a second set. I bought the first set for myself because I have been using really bad brushes for a long time and decided it was time to get a really good set but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. When I saw this set I was curious since they told you what each brush was and what kind of hair it had. I like the packaging and that the larger brushes have sleeves so they keep their shape. I washed them immediately and dried them and they were still perfect! I bought a second set for my husband who is a professional make up artist. He loves them too! They are made very well and you have pretty much anything you need to make up any look.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing!!! They are super soft and really dense. The makeup application is incredible and smooth. I give an amazing A+ to this beautiful set.</li>
    <li> I love these. I spent a long time thinking about if I should get this or the super expensive sigma brushes and in the end I&#x27;m glad I went for these. Trust me, stop thinking about getting them and order it now. They work so well</li>
    <li> I used it for prom and it was perfect</li>
    <li> i use the hell outta these brushes</li>
    <li> The best brushes i&#x27;ve ever tried, so soft an comfortable to hold. All brushes are functional. No unpleasant smell. Perfect especially for beginners. Love it.</li>
    <li> This set of brushes is amazing. The bristles are very soft and they do not irritate my skin. They are very easy to clean and hardly any of the hairs fall out. I am very happy with my purchase and with the quality of Coastal Scents&#x27; products!</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are great for the cost, they are extremely soft and great quality. I have to say I don&#x27;t regret buying them at all😊</li>
    <li> We purchased 3 of these items, and they work really well my sister inlaw, my sister and myself are very happy with the brush set.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality !!</li>
    <li> A brush set that&#x27;s simply perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this purchase because of the low price of this set but I was so pleasantly surprised. These brushes are amazing, very soft but able to pickup product, no shedding like so many brushes I&#x27;ve had before. They are substantial and work great for what I need. They do have a funny smell but after taking them out of the plastic case it faded away. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> I use most of the brushes in the set every day. After the first wash some of them lose a few bristles here and there. I like that the bigger brushes come with protective sleeves to keep them in so they keep their shape. These brushes blend well, better than e.l.f. in my opinion. I love that they stay in the case so it makes traveling with them a lot easier. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with these brushes.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  It was a great buy. I really think that they are good quality even though there are others that are better quality but more expensive. The number of brushes is great!! I still haven&#x27;t even used them all!!</li>
    <li> For the price, I think it&#x27;s a really decent brush set. I think for the beginner or even the semi experienced make up artist, you get a lot of brushes of pretty decent quality and get to practice a lot of techniques and mess around without getting too invested in any one brush that you may or may not like.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this after reading the reviews. I  can&#x27;t really afford the super nice brushes yet. This are very satisfying to me! They seem like they work great as I&#x27;m still learning.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great variety of brushes.  Brushes are soft and makes application smooth and easy.  I recommend this product!  5 stars.</li>
    <li> You really cant beat the price for what you get. They do shed a little but not too badly. I use these daily and have to say that overall i would buy them again. You are not talking Sigma or MAC quality here, but again you get what you pay for. This is a great set for someone starting out messing with makeup or even a teenager. Would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Especially for the price, you cannot beat these brushes.  Great set.</li>
    <li> This brush set is perfect for beginners wanting to get into makeup. They didn&#x27;t shed for me, and they are all high quality and get the job done. The packaging is nice too. It smells a little weird. But once you wash your brushes that&#x27;s not a problem. The only problem I have is that they don&#x27;t label the brushes. But other than that these brushes are great!</li>
    <li> These were a gift and she loves them. Very soft brushes, great selection and seem like they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday since to do my makeup. My favorite brushs are the foundation kabuki brush, flat eyeliner, and the eyeshadow round shading brushes. The kabuki brush is so soft and you cant tell the difference between this and the bare minerals foundation brush.  Some of the brushes may be a notch below MAC but it comes pretty close for me and for this price, I would rather purchase this set for a fraction of the cost. I love it!</li>
    <li> love these brushes! they are so soft and inexpensive and great quality. 22 brushes for 30 bucks? you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Brushes are great ordered another for daughter!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this set for a great price! Often times we spend 30-50 bucks on ONE brush at MAC becuase of the name brand.  These brushes are great and came at a great price!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how useful this brushes are. After reading all the reviews I wasn´t sure about ordering this set, but i am relieved I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes pick up the material very nice and they are very soft against your skin (Only brush 18 hurts you eye a little when using it for liner)&lt;br /&gt;My makeup teacher actually said this was a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;My bag didn´t came with any smell, as some reviews said but is not very good quality, so I am afraid they will slip.</li>
    <li> You have a brush for all your needs...packaging is easy to carry and bristels do not fall out...easy to clean</li>
    <li> Love this Set. It&#x27;s very professional. I do my make up all the time with this set. When I was a make up artist assistant, I used these brushes. Love it</li>
    <li> This is an excellent deal for professional quality brushes. however after cleaning them a few times with water and shampoo the glue became loose on two of my most used brushes. This is easy to fix with a quality glue but mildly frustrating.</li>
    <li> my gf brought this and loves it, the hair comes off thou</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft. They pick up powders really well and feel smooth on your skin. Love them!</li>
    <li> This brush set was featured on Ipsy Me and I missed it!!! But I watched Crisspy&#x27;s tutorial and fell in love.  As a beginner in the makeup world, this set seemed to cover every type of brush necessary to achieve multiple looks.  I researched many brushes and since I was new to the scene, spending the amount of money of this set on one brush seemed ridiculous.  I have been using them for 3 months now and haven&#x27;t regretted the decision at all.  I have used every brush at least 3 times and others every day since I purchased them.  I have also washed them several times and there has not been any hair shedding or damage to them.  The handles are nice and long and the case is perfect for traveling.  I would recommend this set to anyone in any level of makeup expertise.&lt;br /&gt;~Pam</li>
    <li> One of the reasons why I am saying this product deserves 5 stars is due to the price you to what you actually get! This price is incredible for the brush quality, not to mention that there are 22 OF THEM! In makeup you usually pay for what you get, &amp; here this is an amazing deal to creat virtually ANY look... This buy really was a steal</li>
    <li> Very good quality bruches but i noticed that the small bruches a few are the same but the cuality very soft</li>
    <li> Great set. really good quality, especially for price. I would recommend this set to anyone that wants to start wearing makeup because this set has it all. the price is spectacular for the quality and I am in love with these brushes.</li>
    <li> Brushes are a bit flimsy, but the set came quickly and minimal shedding.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set. I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding and the brushes are keeping their shape. Theres a brush for everything!</li>
    <li> it was a gift and she loves it</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft! They don&#x27;t shred they are gorgeous and do an amazing job when applying makeup! I&#x27;ve had them for over a year and they&#x27;re still soft and beautiful like when I first bought them!</li>
    <li> I have never had brushes before, at least not specially bought, but rather those that come already in shadows and blushes. Since I have nothing to compare them with, maybe I won&#x27;t be the best reviewer, but I just needed to state how please I&#x27;m with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to my prime account, shipping only took 2 days, and I felt satisfied about how they were packed. Initially (as others have said) they smelled like plastic, but I aired them for 2 days, and it started vanishing, and right now it doesn&#x27;t smell at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The variety of brushes is great, and I think you can create ANY look you want using them. They are pretty soft and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They might not be MAC or Sigma, but for a starter like me, this set pays off!!! I&#x27;ve been wanting to have a set of brushes and after searching online, and reading many reviews, decided to give it a try! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, LOVE THE FEEL OF THE BRUSHES SEEM TO BE HIGH QUALTY&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this make-up brush set from coastal scents.  these brushes are high quality, one of the best sets I used.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift I did open early and I cant believe how soft they are!!! The first thing I saw was the GIGANTIC fan brush but the other brushes are normal true size. The &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; part of the brush is kind of fat so its nice to hold on to. I purchased a set of TIGI brushes and wow they suck the hair falls out but it is my fault they are goat hair. The Costal Scents was hard for me to just click buy for because feeling the brush is a must. I went out on a whim and read the other reviews and went for it than goodness I did.. I also went on Coastal Scents and purchased a few super cheap on sale palettes!!! Love themmmmm..........buttttt back to the brushes how dare I say better than some professional 40$ a pop per brush.. A MUST HAVE I&#x27;M IN LOVE!!</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets of these brushes to give to both of my sisters for Christmas, I didn&#x27;t get them until about a week after Christmas; They are so soft and amazing I ended up keeping one set for myself because one of my sister didn&#x27;t get me anything and i just love love them; this set includes every brush i need to do my Kim Kardashian contour look and many others. will recommend. I gave it four stars because it would have been great if it came with instructions for what each brush is basically used for instead of me having to youtube reviews.</li>
    <li> Love the brush set but it has one flaw if you use the power brush all over after you have eye makeup on it picks up any color and distributes it all over your face. I went out with black on my checks from my eyeliner or shadow, not sure which one but this has happen twice so be careful with blending all over with any eye makeup on. I do love the eye applications, only wish brushes were marked/named.</li>
    <li> Good brushes! I love how they make your eyeshadow look so vibrant! Buy them!!! The brushes are&lt;br /&gt;Soooo Very soft!</li>
    <li> After 2 months of shedding...they fell apart!!! when they showed up they smelled and we&#x27;re leaking dye and shedding terribly... so I washed them... and washed them and washed them.... after every use some brushes would still leave hairs all over your face... then the one that had been fairly shed free... the handle fell off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this same set for others and they turned out better, this set was garbage though.</li>
    <li> just recieved it today and i love it so much nothing is broken, no funny smell or anything. they&#x27;re absolutely perfect i can&#x27;t wait to put them to work, ,  plus i love the case it comes in, really cute</li>
    <li> I love this makeup brush set. I have never purchased anything from coastal cents but I assure you that you will be pleased. They really are high quality brushes</li>
    <li> Wonderful great quality</li>
    <li> Love this set. Brushes are durable and I would purchase Again.</li>
    <li> Love this set. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all.</li>
    <li> A must have one of the brushes might shed from time to time but the rest are amazing</li>
    <li> Couple of my brushes shed when I clean them.</li>
    <li> Great price. Great brushes!</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this product. For the price and the amount of brushes, it&#x27;s a really good deal. I like majority of the brushes because they are really soft. The only brush that I really don&#x27;t like is the big concealer brush because it was very prickley to where I just can&#x27;t use it. But overall, I&#x27;m satsified and would recommend the set to friends.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price, wide selection for those more familiar with makeup, easy to use for a beginner, very nice and happy with the purchase.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Without making this review extremely long. I want to say I am a professional MUA 10 years in the business. I recycle or \\&quot;collect\\&quot; brushes constantly but have completely started my kit over. Without getting into the history of brushes etc.. I will say this set comes complete with , synthetic hair, one pony hair but the majority are BADGER hair brushes..which are FANTASTIC. Basically these are quality brushes for an outrageous price. In this one set I have done theatrical makeup ( heavy cream shadows and paints) , Beauty makeup and much more , no need to have to look for another brush out of my old stash. It simply is best by itself. So if you are looking for quality brushes for a good price.. this is your set. The brushes wash well , no shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Learn what each brush is supposed to do , how long the color last on the brush and the type of coverage. If you do not know these things you will not understand the deal you are getting here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note about the seller. The shipping was fast I ordered it one day and received it the next. The case that it comes with is perfect, it completely eliminated my apron and also my brush bundle. It&#x27;s the size of a medium/large clutch and it made of faux leather..durable and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I love this set. It is a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 22 piece brush set by Coastal Scents is a must-buy for someone that wants to broaden their makeup brush collection. I have been interested in makeup for years, and I have mostly used random brushes that I have picked up here and there. All I hear about is how M.A.C. has the best brushes, but I personally can&#x27;t spend that much on one brush. After doing some research, I came across this Coastal Scents set. It seemed to have a ton of great reviews, and lets be honest.. The price is a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fianc&amp;eacute; was actually the one that surprised me by ordering the set for me (sorry ladies, he&#x27;s taken ;)). I was super excited as soon as the set arrived at my door. The material is really sturdy, and the brushes were all wrapped in plastic and organized perfectly, and there is even a zipper pocket. There was a slight plastic smell when I first opened it, but it has gone away since I&#x27;ve been using it. The brushes are soft and seem to be great quality. All brushes are not made of the same material.. It seems that someone really took the time to think out the best brushes to put in the set. There is a great range of brushes from a fan brush, foundation brush, contour brush, all the eyeshadow brushes you could ever need, pencil brushes, and even a small felt-tip brush. There is little bristle fallout when using these brushes, and they hold up well so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with this set. Seriously, go ahead and buy it. It has so many uses, and you really can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do it.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves this set she said it has everything in it she needs to apply her makeup this was a great buy</li>
    <li> I have owned these brushes for several months now. I currently own over 4 brush sets including my $119 Sigma brush set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;If your like me you go through 2-5 brushes every time your doing your makeup and wash your brushes at the end of the week, these brushes will get it done without spending hundreds of dollars. I was looking for just eye brushes not face and this set had many.&lt;br /&gt;I like that they have an equal amount of bigger and small eye brushes, I have small eyes so the small ones are perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;I pulled on all the handles, they are very solid and well made.&lt;br /&gt;They are very very soft , comparable to my $119 sigma brush set.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons for me.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is horrific , more so the case not the brushes which is not a big deal I just throw the cases away anyways.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed on a couple handles the paint dried and was chipped looking under the finishing coat of paint. Again not a huge deal&lt;br /&gt;They bristles where shedding like crazy when I fist examined them pulling and tugging at them. After several washes they have gotten better but still see minimal shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can deal with the cons like I did which really arnt a huge big deal these are decent brushes,  would I buy them again?  Sure- we can always use more brushes even if they arnt the best top quality.  : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update::  purchased  10/02/2012.  Now.  5/28/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went through 60 something pages to find my review to change to 5 stars.  I have mac brushes, sigma, and tons of other brands.&lt;br /&gt;For what you get the quality is excellent.  They have lasted much longer then some of my other more expensive brands.  I am actually buying another set as we speak.  I have over 80 + brushes this set has lasted the longest through uses and washes.  No more lost hairs after few washes within couple weeks, no smell either.  Had almost 2 years and great condition.</li>
    <li> If you are interested in having a wide range of brushes and not paying out the nose for each one, this is a lovely kit to get you started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some stand-out brushes.  The foundation brush works well with both foundation and application of concealer to larger area; it created extremely smooth results with the products I was using.  The flat, stiff, longer eyeshadow brush was great for packing on product to the lid and was large enough to apply a lot of product but small enough to keep control of where I was applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are multiple sizes of eyeliner brushes and I have been very, very pleased with how easy they are to work with. They create smooth lines and are not too hard or soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The softer fluffier eyeshadow brushes get the job done, but I almost wish they were a bit longer so that blending was easier/quicker.  They are still very versatile and have multiple sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large fan brush is a bit larger and softer than I am used to with fan brushes - it&#x27;s still useful for things like wiping away fallout and excess or applying soft halos or highlighter to large areas, but for those looking for more control or the ability to apply more product might look to replace or add a different fan brush to this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple notable brushes not included in this set - the brush I thought was a stippling brush from the picture turned out to be more of a highlight applier (although a good one, I tried to use it for stippling as an experiment and it is a very solid bunch of bristles and applies too much product to use for an airbrushed foundation look) and there is nothing that I could use as a lip brush.  I still highly recommend getting this and adding or changing out whatever brushes you might need to suit your individual interests because it&#x27;s a great way to plunge in to owning/using a variety of make-up brushes, and the case holds everything together nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice to use , the price was right, will consider to use this store again, thank you and have a great day</li>
    <li> Iam really satisfied with the products&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are too soft&lt;br /&gt;Acctually you can say that they are the best brushes regarding the price of the brushes&lt;br /&gt;And what surprised me that it took only 5 days to be delivered to uae</li>
    <li> Super nice, good products , great price. In the beggining smells terrible, no kidding, terrible, so I wash them with shampoo and dry them and after few days was odorless</li>
    <li> Great product, good quality brushes, soft bristles, minimal to no fall out, every variety of brush you will ever need and all for a great price! Love it!</li>
    <li> When I purchased these there was an issue with my package being lost in transit but when I emailed them about it they got back to me right away, within hours actually, and express mailed me off a new one that same day. The brushes are good, well made and after washing I still have seen no shedding. The only complaint I have is that some of the brushes are TOO soft, I wish the powder brush and some of the eye brushes were a little stiffer. I would definitely recommend this brush set.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes!!!</li>
    <li> So far, I am very pleased with this brush set. I didn&#x27;t notice the odd smell that some other reviewers mentioned, but I do tend to like synthetic smells so there you go. I am new to this comprehensive a set so I went to the product&#x27;s website to look over the description of each brush. I watched a couple of YouTube tutorials and was creating great looks in no time flat. I have some very nice quality brushed that were very expensive and these brush seem to apply product just as well as my top dollar brushes. I would definitely recommend this set to anyone looking to try their hand at creating some new looks!</li>
    <li> In love with the quality for the price! Im very picky with brushes too, so this was a good find.</li>
    <li> They are the best brushes so far... and very easily to clean. Love that the case holder is firm and easy to cary around.</li>
    <li> A great set of brushes for the money.  Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I bought this set of brushes for my own personal use. I was looking to replace all of my own brushes that I had picked up individually over the years. I have now used this set several times and I LOVE them. The quality and the price can not be beat. There was only one thing that I did not like. The case they came in had an unusual smell but the smell went away in about an hour. Buy them for yourself you will not be sorry. As soon as I got them I washed them and let them dry over night. They were great from the first.</li>
    <li> this product is nice i like the brushes and how they apply my foundation, it has a lot of brushes thought, still cant find out what to use what with. i only use the bursh for the liquid foundation, the powder brush and the blush bursh.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fabulous! They&#x27;ve now lasted well over a year and are still good as new. I&#x27;ve kept them washed and clean after use.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this set for Christmas so I ordered it not knowing how nice it really was.  When she opened the item, we were both excited as to how soft and durable the brushes really are.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my wife for Christmas.  She used to work at a makeup store through high school and college so I was dumbfounded to see she only had a few brushes to use.  She is not one to splurge on herself though, so I purchased these based on customer reviews, and my god has this been a hit!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> totally a must have, the price is so worth it. I use it on a daily basis, the brushes are of good quality and the price is a bargain!!!</li>
    <li> Nice brush set for anyone that is learning about makeup application. I used this set in for Esthetician training, and now I still use a few brushes, but I prefer Sigma brushes now.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a Christmas present for my 25 year old daughter and the more she uses it the more she raves about it. Really liked that it came in a real leather case, not plastic or synthenic cloth. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these brushes!!! They are so soft and very quality made.  I have Mac brushes and the bristles are falling out of them all of the time.  I have been using these for months now and I haven&#x27;t had any of the bristles fall out and they are so soft and work amazing!!! I was so surprised by the price and for all of the brushes that you get and the quality, you couldn&#x27;t get a better deal! :)</li>
    <li> Just received my set i was really scared to buy them but to my surprise these babys are amazing they r super soft. They are very dense and sturdy every brush is perfect... i love them i will buy more in then the future...</li>
    <li> These brushes are a great starter kit, they are so soft and durable. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional makeup artist, but I did help out with makeup for a theatrical production and we used this brush set.  Every day, all of the cast members commented on how soft the brushes were.  I didn&#x27;t notice any shedding when we cleaned the brushes and we cleaned them a LOT since we only had 2 kits and many in the cast.  I loved this set so much that I&#x27;m getting it for myself and will probably get some as gifts also. I expected the price for this set to be well over $100 so the price is phenomenal!</li>
    <li> I wanted a nice quality brush for a reasonable price and that is exactly what I received. The package came with a brush for absolutely every make up trick you can think of. The only thing I wish this brush set did was label the brushes with what they were originally meant.  For make up rookies like myself knowing the correct brushes for different applications would have proven to be extremely helpful.</li>
    <li> Love this brush set. No complaints yet!</li>
    <li> Just purchased these brushes after everyone saying they&#x27;re really good quality! I can&#x27;t wait till I get mine within a few days! 😊 I&#x27;ll keep updated</li>
    <li> Amazing quality and price for these brushes!</li>
    <li> Package arrived nicely. Description matched the product, I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this new make up set!</li>
    <li> this set covers most of the brushes one needs for applying makeup. An eyeliner brush should of been included. too bad.</li>
    <li> I adore the brushes.. They arrived earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big makeup person but this was a great set to start with if you&#x27;re interested in trying new makeup tricks like contouring and shading.</li>
    <li> Very good product for a low price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of 5 he brushes</li>
    <li> Great price and very good quality especially for a first set. Blends very well and does not shed. The case it comes in does not smell as other reviewers have complained.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so great they came right on time they came in perfect condition packaged well and the bag it so good quality for the brushes I was really surprised the only down fall is that two or three brushes had fall out but that was not too bad the rest falls off when you wash them. I totally recommend it for anyone who wants brushes that is on a budget that are high quality.</li>
    <li> The brushes are pretty awesome. Not as amazingly soft as people raved on about but still definitely soft. Amazing range of brushes. Stipling brush has got to be my favourite. Extremely handy bag. Great handles. Annoying that it is not labelled but can live with it. Has plastic protection which is also great. Great quality and work well.</li>
    <li> Loe these brushes don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. I am a MUA and have two sets these are comparable to sigma brushes</li>
    <li> I bought this directly from the Coastal Scents website for 50% off during Black Friday and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Excellent quality brushes at very affordable prices. My favorites in this kit are the large shading brush (I bought additional backups) and the flat top two toned brush. The pack smells like plastic when you first get it but I let it air out while I washed the brushes and it was fine. I washed them using The Masters Brush Cleaner and Preserver, quick and easy.</li>
    <li> Best brushes for the money! My granddaughter &amp; I really like them.</li>
    <li> Love these! Been using them for about a year and they are still perfect. Only thing is the paint is starting to chip off the handles but other than that, awesome.</li>
    <li> i love my makeup brush set what more can i ask for...oh my goodness it was so worth it money well spent shipping was good also and the brushes felt so soft..only thing they kinda smell funky lol but jus open it for a bit and the aroma will fade.</li>
    <li> This would be my first official set of make up brushes i have bought and they are amazing!!!! I am on my way to becoming America&#x27;s Next Big MUA lol and these brushes are sure going to help. The bristles are very soft and application is like magic. I would def. buy this again if anything ever happened to my set. Enjoy :)</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m in love with the brushes. They are great quality for the price.  It&#x27;s no need for me to buy high end brushes any more.</li>
    <li> this set give me many of brushes that are multiple use . the set have variable in size , so you can use more than one brush in many things , for makeup of eye or lips ... I think it&#x27;s amazing and the price is Less than it deserves.</li>
    <li> Great quality at such affordable price. I love these brushes. Its a great set of brushes for starters and experts.</li>
    <li> I received my brushes thursday last week, and I opened them and instantly fell inlove!!! My boyfriend was looking at me all crazy because I was so excited! if you are looking for a set of GREAT makeup brushes look no further. The wide range of brushes allow you to create any amazing look your creative mind can conjure. I purchased plenty of brushes even high priced Mac brushes, well I&#x27;ll leave you with this. Those MAC brushes have been out of a job since I received my new set. THANKS COASTAL SCENTS!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Received brush set in a timely manner. The Brushes are soft, they dont shed and I love the variety. Recommend these brushes to artists or the makeup lover</li>
    <li> Its nice items and nice deal with the seller i like the way how he keep the item inside and the packing&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my wife and she loves it. It&#x27;s a very nice set, She especially likes the many brushes. She&#x27;s happy with the set and so am I. Its a great for the price.</li>
    <li> I recently got scammed on EBay and purchased a 32 fake Mac brush set. How was I supposed to know Mac doesn&#x27;t ever sell large brush sets? Anyways I was slightly nervous to buy another brush set because the one I had just bought was so horrible and they shedded everywhere!!!! I took a risk on this set because I adore Coastal Scents and have never received a substandard product from them. I must say I am so thoroughly pleased with this set. They are soft, sturdy, don&#x27;t shed and come with the best variety of brushes. As soon as I received them I immediately washed them and the dye from the bristles did not bleed and there was absolutely NO SHEDDING. I love doing all sorts of eye shadow looks and truly appreciate the number of eye shadow brushes given in this set. I love love love the small shader brush and small eye liner brush. I am so pleased that I got this set and only wish I bought these first before I got scammed on EBay. If you want quality brushes at an affordable price, these are the brushes for you. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this purchase!!!!!</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised. Very good condition.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS !! I definitely got more than I paid for . Arrived extremely  .</li>
    <li> I like the bag and the sythetic brushes work great which are about 3 of them, the other 20 suck. The bristles fall everywhere and get stuck to your face. It should have been cheaper.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush set! I purchased this thinking it would be a &amp;#34;for now&amp;#34; purchase until I slowly was able to purchase more expensive brushes. I am still buying expensive brushes little by little, but I&#x27;ve found these work almost as well as many of the Sephora professional brushes. I especially like the foundation brush, the dome and several of the small blender brushes. I am blown away by the quality at this price point!</li>
    <li> took a long time to arrive and something went wrong with the antrac ppl:(</li>
    <li> Shipper super fast and is an amazing product for the price.</li>
    <li> Value for your money. Great quality and the storage is excellent. Would definitely recommend this set.</li>
    <li> A good &amp;#34; cheap &amp;#34; option .</li>
    <li> Sadly, I have found that many of these brushes shed a lot.  For the price, though, it is a good starter set.  Very nicely packaged and in a nice carrying case.</li>
    <li> Love this set!  Only issue is that  I needed to use lip and/or linger brushes for more minute eye shadow applications.</li>
    <li> This is original brush set I like it</li>
    <li> gave as a gift to my cosmetologist friend, she loves it. Everday use</li>
    <li> Excellent set for a newbie at doing makeup or someone on a non professional level at home who loves makeup. Only down side to this set is that if you aren&#x27;t a professional makeup artist or someone with extensive knowledge of brushes you have no way of knowing what brush is for what because they aren&#x27;t labeled. On a different note you can find a chart on the brushes on the Coastal Scents website.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES, IT&#x27;S MY FIRST SET, VERY SOFT BRUSHES NO SHEDDING. A MUST BUY!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a freelance makeup artist &amp; I was really looking for a good quality brush set at a great price!It is really hard to find high quality brushes without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Coastal Scents 22 piece makeup brush set is GREAT quality at a great price, I would suggest this product to anyone starting out as a makeup artist or for anyone using at home! It has all the essential brushes you would need for everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that my be a \\&quot;turn off\\&quot; for some of you is that it does have a plasticky smell to it when you first open it.&lt;br /&gt;It does fade if you leave it out &amp; use it often.</li>
    <li> These are some really nice brushes, especially the bigger ones... The only problem I had was the small eyeshadow brushes shedding, but really what can you expect with a set of brushes that are only 35 dollars... I say it is totally worth the buy especially if your New and looking for some where to begin I say go for it</li>
    <li> Hello I am a make up artist and these are by far the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews, these brushes work very well and do an EXCELLENT job applying make up. Definitely a steal!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. I&#x27;ve never used Coastal Scents before, though I would take the opportunity and purchase this set. I absolutely love them. None of the brushes were messed up/broken when I received the set. I expected a few stray hairs sense it was traveling from KY to CA but everything was beautifully packaged. The fan brush is huge! I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a large, thick, duo fiber fan brush and I&#x27;ve finally found it. If you&#x27;re not a professional, you&#x27;ll want to go to their website because the brushes are not labeled, but you can find the names and uses on their website. Like any brush set, you&#x27;ll definitely want to wash them before you use them. Definitely 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I LOVE everything about it! I use it everyday. All the brushes work great and it came super fast too!</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes and I have to say I LOVE THEM !!! They are really soft and great quality for the budget :) but the case is abit smelly though but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes...soooo much! They&#x27;re soft and nice quality with very little fall out. Make up application is flawless. Before purchasing this kit, I was using Sephora brand brushes which were super expensive and I don&#x27;t like them nearly as much as I like these Coastal Scents brushes--in fact, I haven&#x27;t even used them since purchasing this brush set. A must have!</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that most of the brushes are eye brushes.</li>
    <li> I did not ask this item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know who gave the purchase order</li>
    <li> I have had this brush set for almost a year now. They are still in perfect condition and they are used daily. The variety of brushes in this set makes it perfect for a full face makeup application. My only suggestion would to make one of the 3 small angled brushes a natural bristle instead of all synthetic so I could work my powdered shadows to fill my brows easier. But for the money I saved buying this entire kit I just bought one separately and added it to this collection so it&#x27;s all good. The brush roll is also a great way to store them or travel with. I love this brush set and am so impressed with the quality, I have had no shedding or problems at all. I would absolutely recommend!</li>
    <li> great quality at a great price! I cant believe these fantastic brushes were so affordable!! I most definitely recommend these to anyone!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping, funky paint smell to it though, and the fan brush some of the bristles were bend out of shape, other than that I love it! Oh and it also comes with a little zip compartment :)</li>
    <li> I only recently started getting into makeup and was looking for just a basic brush kit. When I stumbled onto this 22 piece set, I was absolutely intrigued--what possible uses are there for 22 different brushes?? But at $35, it wasn&#x27;t too expensive so I decided to investigate, read the great reviews, and went ahead and purchased. I agree that the brushes and pouch smell kind of funny when I first got them, but after a good wash, the smell on the brushes went away, although I did notice some lingering smell on the two duofiber buffing brushes. But for a beginner, this is a GREAT brush set! They&#x27;re very soft and the variety of brushes allows for experimentation. Coastal Scents is a great yet affordable brand, and I&#x27;m very glad I made this purchase. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I just received my coastal scents brush set. I am super picky with my makeup brushes. I am sooooooooo pleased with them so far. I was so skeptical about getting them at first even after all the good reviews. I just didn&#x27;t want to waste my time and money but, I am glad I bought them. I am pleased to say that the quality of it is definitely better than most brands I have come across. I own Mac brushes and never used any but Mac. These brushes I got from Coastal Scents are up there with my Mac brushes if not better with the feel. I have not tried my make up on it yet.  But, as soon as I do I will update this review regarding how it applies make up and the usage. The shipping was super fast too! Five stars for now.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money! Nice quality brushes would recommend. I only gave it four stars because when I opened the item, there was a strong chemical smell from the plastic. It that goes away in a day or two. So, if you don&#x27;t mind the initial smell, I would definitely buy these!</li>
    <li> I spent hours upon hours reading reviews and watching the reviews on youtube for these brushes before I decided to make the purchase and I NEVER write reviews but decided to this time......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been doing my makeup for about 5yrs I still consider myself a beginner and I must say that I LOVE these brushes, I seen some reviews and people were saying that they were shedding like crazy but mine didnt even after they were washed, yes the package did have a smell to it BUT it went away in what seemed like seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people stated well they sure arent Mac BUT you cant pay Ford prices and expect to have a Mercedes. All in all I say if you want a decent set of brushes then GO for it &amp; make that purchase.. I hope this helps someone</li>
    <li> i love this brush set. the quality is awesome for the price. these brushes do not shed at all and the case is very sturdy. i love this brushes i wont be needing new brushes for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always looked at different brush sets and this is by far the absolute best one. the brushes feel strong and DO NOT SHED. The brush bristles are just right, not to soft, and they don&#x27;t feel rough either. I love these brushes! iIbought them for myself, my sister, and my friend. They are both just as inlove as I am.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes are great while some of the smaller non-synthetic brushes don&#x27;t do well at picking up and placing eye shadows..... The facial brushes are great and work really well with liquid, mineral and powder foundations and concealers. When I received my order the fan brush was damaged so amazon sent out another package for me to switch which had damaged bristles.I have washed them several times and I&#x27;ve had no shedding since.</li>
    <li> I have been seriously impressed with these brushes.  I have a few duplicates with very high dollar brushes and I find the quality practically the same.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this set enough. Not all the brushes are perfect but the quality for the price overwrites any negatives. Some of the brushes have managed to replace my Real Techniques and MAC brushes! To read my full review and what I use each brush for  follow the link[...]</li>
    <li> I have had this set for almost 5 months, it is awesome! I would totally purchase again, and recommend to a friend. One thing is that the white flattop brush, is now shedding alot/: it was one of my faves, and the black contour brush is also shedding. Other than those two the rest are perfectly fine:) I think the shedding was my fault for the way i washed them.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to using my fingers again! These brushes are great! I use less makeup now and it looks so much better! I only regularly use about 5 or 6 of the brushes, but I love them! Every once in a while one of the bristles will come out , but I haven&#x27;t had too much of a problem with it. I also really like the brush case, it keeps everything neat and organized.</li>
    <li> so far so good, amazing option for folks without a whole lot of $$$ but still want that $$$$$ look.</li>
    <li> I have had these for about 2 months and they are really high quality brushes. If you are starting out with makeup, or on a budget these are for you as they have every brush you could need to create looks. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> At first I was kind of iffy about getting this brush set but they&#x27;re actually pretty good duality. The brushes are very soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out when I wash them. I absolutely love these brushes and would definitely recomend them.</li>
    <li> Love better than my professional make up brushes. Easy to sanitize too.</li>
    <li> Amazing set! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have quite a few brushes of different brands. I&#x27;m pretty impressed with these. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding and nothing has fallen apart. This does give me a nice selection of brushes for all my blending needs. The only things I think should be included are a spoolie and a brow brush then it would be pretty much complete. The case is nice too. Not flimsy at all. This is a great bundle of brushes for your money.</li>
    <li> I was very please with this purchase. Coastal Scents 22 Piece Brush Set are excellent. Whish I had purchased sooner. A brush for every need.</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived to me quickly. Two days to be exact. The case doesn&#x27;t really have a bad odor like some makeup brush sets do and the brushes didn&#x27;t smell bad at all. They are soooo soft and barely shed, even after washing them before use. I bought a few sets as gifts and one for myself because I love them so much!! This was definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush set! I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for this price range. Nice and soft, easy on the skin. They came in a faux leather case which looks very nice and professional. This set also has all the essential brushes for eye shadow, eyeliner, and foundation. Would definatrly buy them again and recommend to all my friends!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best brushes set in my collection. Good quality, best finished product and beautiful leather jacket.</li>
    <li> Soft brushes, but shed like crazy. I picked off probably 10 loose bristles from my face the first time I used these. Definitely got what I paid for, I guess!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all ranges of beauty gurus. I purchased this as my first item ever from Amazon and was nervous about the quality. Once it arrived (on time) I was extremely happy each brush has a great purpose and finishes off anyone&#x27;s brush collection. I was very happy with the quality and very pleased with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I don&#x27;t normally leave product review, but I was so happy with the quality of this brushes! 2 out of the 22 brush had some light shedding when i cleaned and conditioned it. The quality is beyond its price.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. It has all the tools I need to create any look I want, and it all goes conveniently together in one pack. The brushes are durable, and hold color very well, and are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Not Sigma but nice quality for the price. Even if you only love a few of the brushes, the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had little fallout from these brushes and they clean up pretty nicely. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this set and want good quality for not much money, go for it. It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my girl and she loves it</li>
    <li> Wow, for 30 dollars this set is amazing. All the brushes that I could wish for and they are amazing :D:D....I am going to order 2 more for my sisters.....LOVE THEM.</li>
    <li> This set of brushes is amazing. They arrived on time and properly packaged as well. The brushes are so soft and I have not had an issue with them. I am addicted to Coastal Scents products!! :)</li>
    <li> I order a new set every year- that&#x27;s how much I love these! So worth the price and excellent quality.</li>
    <li> just love this set ! really nice and good quality. very soft. comfortable to use. everyone just love it when I show it to them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so many different brush sets from Sephora. But never wanted to spend all the money in MAC for specific brushes. This professional brush set is PERFECT! Comes with every brush you need &amp; then some. The picture is exactly what you get. Presentation for this product is fantastic. I use them every single day &amp; it was the best buy I can say as a makeup artist</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes.  I bought these for a drama student Granddaughter and I have no doubt that she will like them.  The only downside is that the vinyl case smells like a new shower curtain ...I unrolled  it to air it out for a couple of days and it is fine now.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I did not give it as a gift without doing this first.  Other than that, the brushes feel whisper soft and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> So I have a few MAC brushes.. these are just as awesome! didnt smell so great when I got them but I just washed them in gentle hand soap and let them air dry... they are great hold their shape and preform well.. LOVE the holder! EXCELLENT price !</li>
    <li> The first one I bought was for the wife and she loves it!!! Then her aunt saw and said she wanted one therefore she got one for Christmas. She loves this brush set and says its the best one on the market today!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ok people, first off i want to say that i do not work for this company. I never ever write reviews but this is a must. I purchased this product on friday and it got here tuesday morning. After reading through about 100 reviews on this set i finally decided to purchase. I was very scared because the reviews were too good &amp; the product was so inexpensive. BUT i must say that i just receive my brushes and from what i see and feel i am in love. this is not my first brush set so i know good quality and this is great quality. Yes, there is a smell but not as bad as everyone is saying. These brushes are a must buy im telling you. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because i havent use them yet, need to wash first, but i am certain that they will apply makeup well. so excited!!</li>
    <li> I am just a beginner and all of these brushes gave me the professional look I was going for. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I normally purchase brushes individually, and from sephora or MAC. I needed a few brushes and thought why the hell not try this set. It&#x27;s a great price, and should all else fail I paid for 22 brushes the price I normally pay for one. Once I received them I immediately tried them. I will admit the foundation brush is rather small as to what I&#x27;m used to, but aside from that the set is great. I never had a stench to mine, nor bristles fall out. Anyways I keep them pretty well kept cleaning them after every use, and air drying them.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this set to any one</li>
    <li> LOVE these.  My first set of brushes ever; have been a tomboy for a long time.  These are very soft!</li>
    <li> Purchased these brushes a while ago and they have worked wonderful ever since very happy with my purchase they do not shed so Im very pleased with my product</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I decided to buy these brushes because I&#x27;m a college student on a tight budget / makeup fiend. I chose these because I knew I would use most of these brushes regularly. I&#x27;ve only had the brushes for about a week, and I really love them so far. I have a lot of high end makeup brushes but these are just as good (and much, much more affordable)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unboxing: The large fan brush looked like it had been pulled a little on the sides (you can see similar pics in the reviews). This is because the brushes come in little plastic protectors and the brush bristles got caught in the sides. Everything else was fine. There was a faint chemical smell, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. I was very impressed with the feel of the brushes. They&#x27;re soft and dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: I soaked them in warm water and gentle cleanser for a few minutes. Then I rinsed them out and the brushes were perfect! (I just set them on their side to dry instead of upright so that the water doesn&#x27;t destroy the glue bond).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend them. You&#x27;ll use these brushes for years.</li>
    <li> The hairs fell, you get what you pay for basically</li>
    <li> Just awesome, totally love it, all of them soft, and very good quality, the case is also nice. The price was also fine.</li>
    <li> I almost bought the sigma brushes, not because I am a brush fanatic but because I always like to buy the finest things.  I actually ordered it but I spent the whole night tossing and turning and thanks to amazon, I was able to cancel it in the morning. I decided to buy this set because I couldn&#x27;t bear to pay 120.00 for brushes.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!!!  You get more than you ever need (I tend to go for natural make up looks) and with this set, I don&#x27;t feel I need to buy brushes ever again.  If they are synthetic or not, it doesn&#x27;t matter because they feel better than my Too Faced powder brush I paid 30.00 for (the price of this whole set).  It&#x27;s a steal, I recommend anyone to at least give this a try.</li>
    <li> These are amazing brushes. They are really soft and work great. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. Shipped to my house very quickly too.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference good brushes made with applying makeup. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Such a great deal too! I was considering spending a whole lot of money on Mac or something but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t. These are great!</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! On time,el producto es el misml de la foto, servicio enviado a tiempo, good!, nice, no more words ok</li>
    <li> By no means am I a make up artist or a pro at managing make up. All i can say is that this set seems like it will be the perfect thing for me to use when doing my makeup in a whole new way. This is my first time purchasing brushes from just a picture online but once i rcvd them a couple days ago I was pretty satisfied by the mere look of them, all of the brushes are soft to the touch and look well put together. I cannot wait to actually use them, but I am almost sure that I will not be dissapointed. :-)</li>
    <li> this brush set is heaven on my face</li>
    <li> few were fake and with the packaging got ruined :( specially the white ones!</li>
    <li> Has a weird sharpie smell when you open it also my box was a little mess up looking&lt;br /&gt;But all the brushes are very soft and I think this is a pretty good deal since &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brushes are rather expensive so if you&#x27;re looking for decent brushes for a cheap price indefinitely recommend this</li>
    <li> Great product, all the raving and awesome reviews were right on target with these brushes! They came nicely packaged, and before there arrival date...which was like less than a week, and there is about every brush I need, I am enjoying some of them more than my Mac brushes to be completely honest!  I will most likely be ordering another set for my freelancing kit!! I recommend this to anyone who wears makeup whether you are an everyday, beginner, special occasion, or professional makeup user/artist!!! #143♥ENJOY!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift. Quality was excellent, great brush set for the price.</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with these brushes! The quality is outstanding and perform as well as if not better than my high end, high priced makeup brushes I&#x27;ve had for years. I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding issues and love the variety of brushes in this set</li>
    <li> Love this set I use many of these brushes everyday for applying my makeup. Great deal for the quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a suggestion, maybe a guide in order to use every piece brush would be grateful.</li>
    <li> Thank you .. on time 👌</li>
    <li> Very good, is what I expected</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have a full set of makeup brushes...mostly just random ones from different brands. I&#x27;m glad that I went with this brush set instead of paying waaaaay more for the more expensive ones. The brushes are very soft, and there is such a variety of different shapes and sizes. I mostly was looking for eye makeup brushes, and this set has a lot to offer along those lines. The case itself will be super nice too for easy traveling. I know a lot of reviews noted that there was a weird smell when they got theirs. I noticed a little bit of a leather smell when I first opened it, but it was very minimal and I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve taken notice of it if I hadn&#x27;t read all the other reviews and had it brought to my attention. I think these brushes help me to apply my makeup in a flattering way, and I am looking forward to experimenting more with them!</li>
    <li> I received these last night, there beyond soft I just hope they turn out good!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a new set of brushes you have found the best ones for the price. I have quite a few high end brushes such as MAC and Urban Decay, but these are by far my favorite ones. The bristles are amazing, they are soft and they blend well. When you clean them they don&#x27;t fall apart and they are well put together. The only downfall is that some of the glue came loose on one of them so I had to re-glue it and its been fine ever since, also the brush roll itself has a string plastic smell. So I let mine air out for a few days and it was fine, I also would say wash the brushes before you use them so that you can get the plastic smell off. Besides that this is the perfect brush set ever! Well, worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great Price! Great deal, great brushes! I Love it all. I just wish they had labels on them. But its okay I love it anyways!</li>
    <li> I am not a professioanal makeup artist, therefore i got this set for everyday use. The leather case has a strong smell to it at first. I put it out on the balcony and it was gone withing couple of hours. The brushes themsleves dont carry that odor. I also washed them with mild soap and water and lay flat to dry. The bristles do not shed, as mentioned in previous review.. The reason i gave 4 stars, i wish the set came with explanation for what each brush must be used for. ( i wouldnt know what half of them are used for). Other than that a very nice quality set for the price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are pretty good quality.  I don&#x27;t think I like these brushes as well as the Sigma brushes but they are still pretty good brushes.  I haven&#x27;t  had any issues with them so far.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MY BRUSHES!!! The flat top brush is my favorite, work just as great as the high end brushes.</li>
    <li> I am makeup artist and have usually used a compilation of different brushes. I decided that it would look nicer to have a cohesive set. They look and feel great. I just don&#x27;t know how they will wear over time. Right now, they are nice.</li>
    <li> Best brushes i have ever purchased and used. For the price highly recommended. Kit is complete with every single brush need for the perfect job.</li>
    <li> Love these Brushes!!!!!!!!!!!! So good and price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Ok I had bought another brand of brushes but it didn&#x27;t have what I needed so I got these brushes and I don&#x27;t need anymore brushes for awhile</li>
    <li> I bought two of these sets, one for myself, one for my daughter.  These are good quality (especially for the price) brushes.  There are so many in the set, I honestly can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ll ever use all of them, but perhaps its because I don&#x27;t use them for all the intended purposes.  lol. The fold up bag they are in is nice and helps keep the brushes together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal, good set. very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Warning - this smells SUPER funky when you first get it.  I actually washed all the brushes twice before using and set the case itself outside to air out for a day or two before using it.  It&#x27;s that plastic smell that I think is so stinky.  But, I use the brushes every day and they&#x27;re holding up perfectly.  I should be better about cleaning them routinely but eh, oh well.&lt;br /&gt;Great value.  No shedding.  Enough brushes for everything except an angled eyebrow brush.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOVE THEM!!!!!!!!! So amazing and soft totally worth the money very happy with this product well done guys woo :)</li>
    <li> I loved these brushes.  They blended the pigments well.  Sturdy...did not shed.  The bag they came in stank a lot so I tossed it, washed the brushes, and all was well :)  very nice brush set.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and they look like high quality. They make application almost effortless. I just wish they had a bit more variety such as a big powder brush or a fluffy blending brush</li>
    <li> To be honest, I expected a lot of shedding especially with the first wash and the price, but after washing all 22 brushes there was only 3 bristles that came out! I have had no problem with bristles coming out wither while applying my makeup. It picks up color really well and great at applying it. The case did have a strong odor when I first got it like others said but I just let it air out over night and it was fine the next day. I don&#x27;t even see that as that much of a negative since it goes away rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone from novice to expert! It&#x27;s a steal for the price!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to receive the brushes in good condition but they were excellent! They are so soft and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my brushes. Good price and quality. It has everything I need. The brushes material is very very good.</li>
    <li> I use these mostly for stage make - up.  They&#x27;re soft and are holding together well.  They clean up great and apply make ups well.&lt;br /&gt;They do come smelling of chemicals (I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was only the case, or the brushes, too - it smelled when I opened the case up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off the plastic covers that protected the brushes and aired them out for a few days.  They were fine after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the case has a flap over the brushes and then folds over them to close.  It&#x27;s in the shape of the base of a paper clamp when it&#x27;s shut.  The case is firm and protects the brushes.  I like these a TON better than the cheaper Shany brushes I got last year (some of which needed to be re-glued and the case is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t protect the brushes well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised the handles were shorter than I expected, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me - actually, I like it better.  They are about 3 and a half (just under) to 6.5 inches long (blush brushes are shorter handled and the eye brushes are longer handled)</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- They are really good for a cheap price&lt;br /&gt;-They are soft and gentle&lt;br /&gt;- I love using them, they make my make-up look more professional&lt;br /&gt;-They look expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The leather case stinks, so I left it outside in my balcony for couple of days till the smell wore off&lt;br /&gt;- The first time I washed them, they are started shedding a little bit; but not anymore&lt;br /&gt;- I wish they came with a user guide but I looked them up online and figured it out :)</li>
    <li> Amazing, great hair it actually looks professional!! I bought this for my sister, and she absolutely love the set and so do I!</li>
    <li> Everyone had good things and bad things to say about these brushes, honestly there amazing. I am so happy i bought these. There super good quality for the price. seriously but these brushes people, they do have a strong smell at first. But let them air out for a few hours and it will be fine :) I just cannot believe how amazing these brushes are!. buy buy buy!!!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for every day use...you get all the brushes you need to create a great look and it&#x27;s a great price! I will be buying this for all the ladies in my family!</li>
    <li> I would say that these brushes are great for their affordable price. I was unsure about ordering online since I would not be able to feel the quality of the brushes, however I must say I am very pleased! I did notice a strong scent when opening the case for the first time, however, after airing out the brushes the scent was gone. Overall a great collection, I&#x27;m a very happy lady!</li>
    <li> i was scared to order because of how cheap but i&#x27;m so glad i did! AWESOME quality and  so worth the money :)</li>
    <li> For less than what you&#x27;d pay for high brand brushes, you get this perfectly packaged set of brushes, they are really soft and smooth-feeling on the skin, they pick up the product perfectly and make very easy the blending part of the job. I totally recommend them. I read some reviews about the smell of the packaging, it does have certain smell but for me it wasn&#x27;t a problem, either way it vanishes when you use and/or wash them.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because I wanted a good set to do makeup for a wedding and I was more than happy with the product. The brushes are good quality for the price and the set has every brush you will need and the case it really nice too. For only $34 you can&#x27;t find a better deal for the quality. I will be buying more of Coastal Scents products.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are all so soft. My favorite brush is the angled brush. It is perfect for blush and bronzer. Overall, these brushes were perfect for what I was looking for and are definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this. The brushes are so soft but still sturdy. They are perfect! Everything you need is in this bundle. This is so much better than buying those expensive department store brushes. The case is also really nice. It&#x27;s not a button snap, its magnets. So much easier to close. When you first open it, it has a strong permanent marker smell but it fades quickly after opening and washing the brushes.</li>
    <li> I had these brushes for a week and the handles all came loose or fellout i was disapointed bcause id heard such good things yet with that bn said i could have recieved a bad bunch they worked ok i think it would b a good beginer set yet i wouldnt recomend them for proffessionals</li>
    <li> They are everything I expected I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist for Lancôme makeup and I just wante to try these coastal scent brushes &amp;#34;Omg&amp;#34; I love em and I want about 2 more pouches of them very soft my favorite is the Flat Buffer Brush good quality for a Great Price &amp; the smell that some are talking about its only the fresh smell of the plastic of something new. I would Rather smell that and know they are new then any other smell and they be old I Love them and I work for a very well known makeup company Lancôme and I Love them</li>
    <li> The brushes exceeded my expectations. They were very soft and didn&#x27;t have an odor like a lot of other reviews said. The ones I got barely shed hair so I know they will last long.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it. It had every brush she needed and wanted. I know how much women love their make-up, so i&#x27;m glad i purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of the price but the brushes are suberb quality!!!! Better than Sigma brushes!!!! Highly recommend! I am a makeup artist and these brushes are amazing and I highly recommend!The brushes are just as good as Sigma but at the fraction of the cost. Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy now!</li>
    <li> So soft and easy to use I will never purchase more expensive brushes again! My go to set has everything I need!</li>
    <li> I am a professional make up artist and I absolutely love these brushes! The quality of these brushes are exceptional! I read other reviews and thought I would give it a try. When I received the brushes I showed them to some friends. They all thought I spent a fortune on them. When I told them the price they couldn&#x27;t believe it! The brushes are high quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy these brushes based on some of the reviews, but since the price is really good for the amount of brushes you are receiving, I decided \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot; and bought them. I must say I am glad I did. It is possible that the manufacturer made some changes due to past reviews, or my expectations were low enough that I was expecting so smell a chemical plant and be poked harshly in the face, but I was pleasantly surprised when I opened them and found neither a horrid smell or stiff bristles. I have washed them already and the shedding only occurred on a few brushes and was minimal (a hair or two). The brushes are very soft (Note: I do not usually use super nice, professional grade brushes). The eye brushes do a good job picking up eye shadow and the blenders seem to do a good job blending. I have not tested all the face brushes, but the angled brush and the big powder brush are nice (though, I did feel a little poking with the big powder brush). If you are not in the market for professional-grade, expensive brushes but would like to increase your brush collection so you can broaden your make-up skills, I recommend these brushes. As far as the roll goes, there was a slight odor but really slight. I had to put my nose up to the roll to smell it (and I have a pretty excellent sense of smell). So again, I either got a really good batch of brushes and case or the manufacturer decided to make some changes.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Sigma set a few years back and loved them. My Sigma brushes were twice as expensive, half the number of brushes and didn&#x27;t come with a case.  Half of them lasted about two years.  I was thinking that these would be a big downgrade from Sigma, but couldn&#x27;t really afford to replace all my brushes.  However, this is a really good set!  I assuming they will not last as long, but I am still amazed to get a so many high quality brushes for such a low price.  I washed them right after I got them. and the bristles seemed very strong and soft.  None of them fell out during the wash, which has happened to my biggest Sigma brushes since the beginning. My first test of them resulted in a beautiful makeup day, and I am super satisfied. The case that these come with is great too!!</li>
    <li> These are very nice.  I&#x27;m not quite sure what each brush is for, but they are very soft and seem to be good quality.</li>
    <li> I have bought soo many different brushes over the years, and spent a ton of money, and none compare to these brushes!  I love them, they have every size brush you could want and they DON&#x27;T shed!! The price is amazing, I would spend this amount for 1 brush at the MAC counter, and I think the quality is better! So worth buying these brushes:)</li>
    <li> I had to look up each brush and the usage since there are so many. Other than that, the smell goes away and the product quality is good for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for months and they have not shed ONCE. The concealer brushes are easy to clean, not like the ones my school gave me. They did smell when they first arrived but I washed them right after and the smell when away quickly. The big brushes come with guards so that&#x27;s a plus! There is even a little pocket with a zipper on the inside (under the fan brush) where you can put the guards and I think that&#x27;s pretty clever. I really recommend these.</li>
    <li> Super pleased with this brush set. It is worth every penny! I would definitely buy it again. All of the brushes are very professional.</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical to buy this. The price was so low and there were SO many brushes. But with Amazons return policy, I figured I would take the chance. I have to say, I&#x27;ve never been more satisfied with a purchase from Amazon before in my life!!! These brushes are so soft, and extremely high-quality. I own plenty of brushes from MAC, Makeup Forever, NARS -- these are just as good, if not better. I love that it comes with so many versatile brushes. Face, lip, eye...the possibilities are endless. I must have played around with them for hours today just trying out different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT HESITATE! If you&#x27;re on the fence, just buy them!!!! They are fantastic!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are fine.  They do shed, however most new brushes shed, and then stop.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for multiple brushes at a reasonable time.  When you open them up for the first time, you will notice a smell.  Wash the brushes before the first use, and air the case for a day or two.  There will be no more smell.</li>
    <li> I love the foundation brushes the best!! I&#x27;m thinking about just getting that by itself...Anyway, all the brushes were very high quality and I DO NOT break out. I have high acne prone skin and I noticed that my acne DECREASED by using these high quality brushes.</li>
    <li> These are very good brushes, every brush you could need, it&#x27;s here. I have not had any issues or problems with these brushes at all. Would buy them again.</li>
    <li> how do i do get my stuff it went to the wrong adderess or could i get a refun  coastal scent 22 piece brush set</li>
    <li> This has an amazing amount of brushes for someone who is just starting out with their brush collection. I bought this for the brush roll.  I am very disappointed in it. The brush pockets were not sewn to last. Shortly after I purchased, several of the pockets tore through &amp; connected to the next pocket (or 2). It no longer can be used to keep my brushes separate. If the case is defective, I have to assume the brushes won&#x27;t last either.</li>
    <li> I have owned numerous brush sets.  These aren&#x27;t that great.  They don&#x27;t hold product well because the hair isn&#x27;t dense.  I found a set of cheap  Sonya Kashuk Target brushes to be much better.  The average person doesn&#x27;t need 22 brushes anyway - opt for a set with fewer but better constructed/higher quality brushes.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t waste time to write reviews but I must warn you that first of all I waited a few weeks to receive the brushes then once I received them they were nothing at all like the picture!!! I have seen this happen to someone before where stuff is brought online from china and they lie about the description of the item and send the wrong item or a similar item of lesser quality! I&#x27;m very upset because I waited awhile now I have to go through a return process!! Never again!! Too much of hassle</li>
    <li> Great Brushes and comes in a nice case. Exactly as it was described. Everything shipped on time. Very Happy and I would recommend to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg for brushes but wants to look like you did. Washable in regular hair shampoo and let them air dry.</li>
    <li> Absolutely happy with these brushes! 100% satisfied,verry well pakeged. They were actually better than I expected totally worth it. It was exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing! i have so much fun with it.  all the brushes are really easy to clean, they don&#x27;t shed and they are so soft and workable.</li>
    <li> Used this for a friend&#x27;s wedding and loved it! The brushes are all very high end looking and work well. My one complaint is the powder brush will occasionally shed. I recommend washing all of them before first use because a few were dirty from packaging and such. I use Baby Magic soap and warm water. A total steal for the price! The picture is of the bride I did.</li>
    <li> **UPDATE**3/17/13&lt;br /&gt;I washed these brushes again as I do every week or two depending on how many times I used them and the worst thing happened. For those of you not familiar with the terms of the brush names the simplistic way is the flat large kabuki or stippling brush completely caved in and all the bristles in the center fell into the brush and out of the top. The same happened with rounded kabuki handle brush last week. This goes to show the glue is not strong and as careful as I am with not getting them wet deep into the handle and drying them properly this still occurred. Not only that but in 3 months of use the performance of these brushes have declined. They don&#x27;t seem pick up as much product or lay it as evenly. I use professional products for cleaning and conditioning as well as brush guards to reshape them while drying. I did really love these brushes. But the shedding that started after a few washes has really destroyed the quality of these brushes. I truly had high hopes for these. I rated them 4 stars and for lower price and in the low mid grade line of brushes would have gave them a solid 5. Now simply a 2 at best because they did last 3 months for 35 dollars. Such a huge disappointment. My Bobbi Brown and MAC brushes have lasted 10 years without a single issue. My old 8-10 year old MAC brushes were prior to Estae Lauder buying them out where as after the buy out I have gotten 5 or do years of use. My Sigma brushes the ones I purchased a year ago and 3 years ago are going strong. I am going to spend the extra 30-60 on purchasing Sedona Lace brushes many wonderful artists I know and work with have been raving about them. Equally comparing to Sigma and some as great as MAC for far less. I am truly heartbroken these did not last.&lt;br /&gt;**END UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;This is a good brush set. This being said if you are expecting a product with the same structure and quality as Mac or Sigma you are barking up the wrong tree. But if you are looking for a personal use decent quality brush set this is for you. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I have pretty much every brand and brush under the sun but I also can&#x27;t help but purchase anything new or that I simply don&#x27;t have out on the market. You never know when you will come across a gem. I have multiples being as I always need 3-5 clean and ready to go sets being as washing and drying will take up to 2 days and I don&#x27;t ever want that to interfere with clients. I wash and condition my brushes not just sterilize them a quick sterilization can have the brushes ready in hours but it can also destroy the brush if done every time and long term. I would not use these on my clients. They deserve and expect the highest level of quality and application. The thing is I am VERY fond of this set for personal use. Some brushes I won&#x27;t ever use and others I&#x27;m using daily. But for around a buck a brush it&#x27;s so worth it and with the ones I gave away from this set or still equals out to a little over $3 a brush factoring in just the ones I kept. I have single brushes and sets from sephora I spent over $125 a set and $20 for individual brushes that I prefer these brushes over those. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding on the natural brushes and minimal on the synthetic brushes. The large fan brush and the angled blush brush had shed the most but nothing serious. I&#x27;ve had these for about a month and washed them a dozen times. They seem to be well constructed the glue is still very much intact. If you are looking for a great priced personal use brush set this is right for you. If you are expecting Mac and Sigma quality from this set I really don&#x27;t know how you could expect anything to perform to that level at such a low price. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that can compete with those brands in my 10 years of artistry and makeup addiction. This is a great beginner set, rotation set, and personal use set. I do wish they were labeled but they only have the brand name on them. The case did have a factory odor I let them air out overnight and the smell went away. It wasn&#x27;t anything terrible reminded me of the new car smell something straight from the factory. All in all it&#x27;s worth the money just don&#x27;t go in expecting Mac or Sigma.</li>
    <li> So many brushes and such an amazing price!  I like the majority of the brushes, however the angled blush brush does shed....I&#x27;ve had the brushes for weeks now and it still sheds!  But the rest of them are pretty good.</li>
    <li> Lovely affordable brushes I loveee them super soft love the case packaging lovely and the shipment was super fast</li>
    <li> My daughter is a makeup junky. This is her dream set and she loves it. Has everything she needs and the case is awesome. The brushes have held up well, I see these lasting a long time</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! The price is amazing for the quality. They 2nd to my mac brushes and above all others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the case smells weird at first. Just let it air out for a day and it&#x27;s totally fine.  Not sure why anyone is making a big deal about it.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  It is soft and does not shed.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars though because  I wish that each brush is labeled as to what it is for, example: eyebrow brush, foundation brush, blending brush.  It would be helpful for those who are using it for personal use and not professional make up artists.</li>
    <li> Really great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> Not an expert, but I think these brushes do the job and are fairly a good quality. Having fun and happy with them.</li>
    <li> I must say that I&#x27;m a bit of a make up snob and brushes happen to b the thing I like to collect. The majority of my brushes are from Sephora, MAC, Bobbi Brown, and Chanel(love their eye brushes). Theses can get quite pricey so lately I&#x27;ve been branching out and trying lesser priced tools and products. I was also looking for those I can use with mixing mediums to avoid the possibility of damaging my others.&lt;br /&gt;There r a few things that are different but In order to be fair I take that into consideration in this review. The main differences i see are: They aren&#x27;t as weighted, some aren&#x27;t as dense mainly the eyeshadows however that doesn&#x27;t seem to affect application and its a very minute amount. I had some initial shedding(minimal) from a few-the ones I remember are the angled blush and the flat bronzer..and it was an acceptable amount-3-4 hairs tops.. I&#x27;ve had more shedding from brushes I paid $40 and up for! Also some of the bristle aren&#x27;t cut to the exact shape but again only 1 or 2. Yes, there is an initial smell but I only noticed it on the brush roll. And once added a little shoe deodorizer I aired it out over night it was gone. The brushes did not have a residual smell. Can&#x27;t judge longevity at this point.&lt;br /&gt;All in all This brush set is fantastic! All of the brushes are very soft but still pick up product well. I absolutely love the duo fiber brushes and I haven&#x27;t seen those particular shapes in any other high end brand. Especially the extra large powder-which I use for BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting various sizes of eyeshadow bullets/pencils and this set gives quite a few. Many of the shapes are &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; of higher end brands. I use them with cream and powder-I tend to ignore the &amp;#34;rules&amp;#34; and they work well-just mist with either a toner or setting spray 1st. Oh the brushes # 17 and #18 (a short shader and a bullet crease)actually look and feel like goat fibers to me. Which I happen to like.&lt;br /&gt;If you give these a fair chance I think you&#x27;db really happy with them. I am!</li>
    <li> they are awesome...as a professional MUA they work well for the price</li>
    <li> there are a couple brushes that are flimsy but most are great i would buy again i am a makeup artist with ruby makeup academy</li>
    <li> I ordered theses brushes and received them fast.  The packaging is cute and the brushes are very soft.  They are good quality and I personally like them more then some M.A.C brushes that I own. You cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> Soft, good quality. No shedding. Picks up color well. Im glad I bought these over sigma brushes. I didnt wnt to spend 100 dollars so instead bought these. Good quality gets the job done and good selection of brushes.</li>
    <li> My daughter purchased these brushes after buying many expensive named brand brushes like Mac, Sephora, etc. These brushes are really good and work well with makeup. If we had purchased these 1st we could have saved some bucks. They are high quality brushes and look good too. They come in a nice pouch with protector covers on the large ones. nice nice nice :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I wanted a decent brush set for a god price. They are so soft and do not shed. I love them and would recommend them.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my adult daughter, she loves all the choices, she&#x27;s still learning what each brush does, I chose this set after reading reviews on the top 5 make-up sets online, really a great value</li>
    <li> love love love!!! Great for the $$$$ ...</li>
    <li> These r awesome to have all the different brushes work well if ur gonna do a lot of blending well worth the money</li>
    <li> I ordered these as a gift for my Daughter for Christmas.  She loves them.  Don&#x27;t quite know what brushes she was using before these, but she talks about how soft they are and how well the make-up application goes when using these brushes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy that I made this purchase.  They are of good quality and so far for two months they still apply make up great even after how many washes!  The few things negative that I can say is that I wish that it came with a smaller or bigger slanted contour brush instead of more of the variety of slanted eyeliner brushes and maybe 2 blending eyeshadow brushes.  The bag did have a weird plastic like smell to it, but I really don&#x27;t keep my brushes in them so the smell was fine with me.</li>
    <li> it has all the brushes to start your makeup off right! a great set at a great price and just as good as the higher end brushes.</li>
    <li> for this price i was surprised to see the good quality of brushes in the set. Im now buying my sisters and mum a set each</li>
    <li> I was so happy when i got this brush set i have to say its the best brush set I&#x27;ve bought ever! :) the eye brushes are much better than the Sigma eye brushes i have the foundation brush is Awesome! dont care for the angled blush brush its rough on the skin and the fan brush would be much better if it was natural hairs but apart from that i still am really happy i got this :) I&#x27;ve yet to find a better brush set</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. :). I got them in June for my birthday, and it is now December, and I use these brushes daily and I have never had a hair fall out of any of them. :). They hold color very well, but wash incredibly easy. And, any brush you need for basic and advanced makeup is in this set. :). Along with that, the case is great. It has a convenient zipper pocket under the fan brush at the front. :). I highly recommend these brushes to anyone who wants great quality, and a low price. :).</li>
    <li> All brushes are great quality and for an amazing price. I use every single brush and i have no shedding or anything. I was at first debating between the sigma brush sets and this one. I had to go for this one since it has 10 more brushes! My only disappointment was that there was no fluffy powder brush. But overall its an amazing brush set.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly pleased with the quality of brushes.  There are some really great ones in the bunch and then a few that aren&#x27;t all that, buy still useable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this brush set to my friends to buy it!  :D</li>
    <li> These brushes are the softest brushes ever. They don&#x27;t shed. The price for all of these brushes is great. Love love love :) Must buy! Great variety of brushes as well</li>
    <li> of course like everyone says, it does have an odor, but it eventually goes away. the product is well worth its cost. has everything i need and the brushes are stunning!!! very very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great array of brushes in a great compact case.  Perfect for travel!  Great to take with for performances to touch up or put on makeup!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this set. The brushes are so so soft and they come with such a variety. You literally have every brush you&#x27;ll need and then some. And the price is just incredible. You get MAC quality brushes for more than half the price! I love these brushes!</li>
    <li> I am entirely happy with my new order. I made a great choice. i will be purchasing other coastal scent products.</li>
    <li> These brushes came the day after they were shipped! Like other reviewers, the case smells a bit funky, but it should go away within a few days.  The brushes are really soft and good quality.  I wish the function of each brush was printed on the handle because I really have no idea what each brush&#x27;s purpose is.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would definitely consider buying this brand in the future!</li>
    <li> I bought this to add to my regular kit. I did not want to invest in more Mac brushes as I needed&lt;br /&gt;many at once. I must say I am not sorry I bought this brush set. The quality of the brushes is&lt;br /&gt;really great! I was so suprized! Some are better than others but they all work great. If you are&lt;br /&gt;looking for an inexpensive set I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!! Purchased them months ago &amp; I just love them !!😍</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Its a great starter set, the brushes are surprisingly good for the price, I&#x27;ve been u sing mine for over a month and have yet to dislike a single one.</li>
    <li> Loves these brushes, washed and three times for the two months that I have had them, and haven&#x27;t had a problem with any of them EXCEPT the powder brush. The handle broke off just recently and I didn&#x27;t even use it often. Nothing a lil glue can&#x27;t fix. Overall these are great brushes and definitely worth this price. BUY THEM NOW!</li>
    <li> This brush is worth for what the prices is. Using it for two days, and the hair is already falling out of it... Very disappointed. Now I just need to get a high end bushes.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as described, and a great price and great product, what more could you ask for? I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am only just recently experimenting with different make up techniques and was looking for a brush set that would give me the brushes I needed but wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. This I am happy to say was perfect for me.  It gave me everything I needed and the brushes were soft and quality was great for the price I paid.  My only negative comment would be that the case had an odd smell to it.  My solution was to spray it with perfume and air it out for a day.  That worked in eliminating the odor.</li>
    <li> This set is awesome.  If you need a starter pack of brushes this is one to get.  You have most everything you need to get started, and you can figure out what type of brushes you like best, and add on from there.  I did find there weren&#x27;t really any amazing blending brushes unfortunately, and a few brushes had some glue in the actual bristles which scratch your eye since it&#x27;s dried, hard glue.</li>
    <li> Overall 5 stars. Really good set of brushes.</li>
    <li> These were a little overwhelming as a first set of brushes but they are great quality! I just wish there were more bigger brushes than smaller ones!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and have a very nice appearence. I can&#x60;t wait to use them!</li>
    <li> Brushes look like they are good quality and they were a fraction of the cost compared to high end brushes.</li>
    <li> they are awesome brushes</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned that these brush would be poor quality but I am very happy with the selection and quality of the brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush handles are very long and feel cheap but the brush itself and the hairs feel really good.</li>
    <li> Im a makeup artist since six years ago, I paid different amount of money in differents make up brushes brands! However this are the  BEST 35 bucks I&#x27;ve spent in my entire career! Really soft! Blends soooooo Well and I know every makeup artist will find this set very helpfull ENJOY!</li>
    <li> I am super picky about my brushes, so I wasn&#x27;t over optimistic that these would be very good. I was wrong! I am in love and would recommend them to anyone. I spent as much on this entire huge set as one or two of my other shadow brushes. WOW!!!</li>
    <li> Ok so I got my brush set and let me first start off by saying that I read all the reviews and was wowed but I was shocked that my set of brushes and the confition that I found them in I found dirt and grime on one of the brushes I was bluffing the bristles and there was marijuana buds inside amd all of the brushes looled overly worn!!!!! The hairs were falling off and I couldn&#x27;t believe by how dirty my brushes were!!!</li>
    <li> sure, a couple of the brushes shed, but with this price, i don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase and the customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks and greetings from Armenia :)</li>
    <li> I totally loooove this item, it was more than I expected!! They are perfect for professional use. Excellent product, totally recommended</li>
    <li> I end up buying an extra one for my sister.  Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;And it came a day before than what expected.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. For the price you cannot beat it anywhere. I work as freelance makeup artist and use mostly Mac. and Sigma brushes and these brushes are up there as far as quality. I plan to buy 2 more of these brush set.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by the quality of this brush set.  It contains all the basics that you need to apply makeup successfully.  As a model, I apply fairly complicated makeup pretty often, and I&#x27;m also used to having professional makeup done on me.  These brushes seem just as nice as any that the pros have used on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is very good.  The brushes are very soft, and have stood up under cleaning (with proper solution).  They are put together solidly -- I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them falling apart, even after several months of use.  I would order these again.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because several blogs raved about the quality of Coastal Scents was comparable to pricier brands. Although I didn&#x27;t notice a strong odor like some of the other reviewers, I did find the quality of the bristles for at least 50% of the brushes to be very poor. I do like the large and small stippling brushes, the foundation brush, and the eyeliner brush very much, but the regular shadow brushes don&#x27;t pick up powder as well as my high-end brushes. I&#x27;ve had this set for over a year and most of the brushes have gotten pretty shaggy and/or started missing bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a decent starter set and the 5 or 6 good brushes are still worth the price of the set.</li>
    <li> Handles fell off but with glue its not an issue. But besides that, I love my brushes. Very nice and good quality.</li>
    <li> I must say that I am IMPRESSED. These brushes are incredible! There is minimal to no fall out, they&#x27;re softer than a baby&#x27;s bottom, they hold product very well, AND the price is unreal!!  I just love them, strongly recommend these.</li>
    <li> LOVED IT! Succeeds expectations! Best for the price!&lt;br /&gt;There is one brush though, that the bristles are a little loose, but I will contact Coastal Scents and should be fixed!</li>
    <li> These brushes were so great considering the price. They are so incredibly soft! Really really happy I bought them :) !</li>
    <li> I love how many brushes you receive for the price. Most of the brushes are very soft and full but a few have minor flaws (misshaped) etc. But for the value this is a great set.</li>
    <li> i PURCHASED THIS BRUSH SET FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.</li>
    <li> This is a great starter set for someone that wants or needs many different brushes. I loved how soft the brushes were, and the quantity. But I will admit, you definitely pay for quantity over quality with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never purchased high end makeup brushes before, you may not notice the difference. But if you have, you will notice that the brushes don&#x27;t pick up or pack on as much color as a high end brush will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is great for travel - it comes in a good roll up case, and every brush you would ever need. They weren&#x27;t bad brushes by any means, but just okay. The set is very reasonable for the price, but I am rating based on quality, which just seemed to be lacking for me. I still use them - especially when I need to take my makeup brushes with me somewhere - they just aren&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
    <li> Everything about this set of brushes is awesome. The case, the quality of the brushes, and the price.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be put off by the comments about the odor, it&#x27;s not that bad. I put my set outside opened up for a few minutes and that took care of it. I&#x27;m very excited and pleased with my gift to self.</li>
    <li> This brush is pretty reliable for its price. the smaller brushes are not that good and some brushes feels good some are rough on skin. This is a good start if you&#x27;re just starting to learn how to put make up on or if you&#x27;re in a budget.</li>
    <li> This brushes were actually pretty great, I figured since they were $30 they weren&#x27;t going to be good quality, but they ended up being great!! I look forward to using them every morning.</li>
    <li> I got this item for my wife. She looked all over for a set that reviewed well, had everything she needed and wasn&#x27;t overpriced.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set.  So many brushes so little time.  I found a use for all of them.</li>
    <li> Great make up brushes. I bought for my gf for her birthday and she loves it. The brushes are really soft and they work great.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of these brushes. I was pleasantly surprised. I don&#x27;t use all of them but these are pretty good brushes. The angled brush is great for contouring, the stippling brush is great for applying foundation and there&#x27;s a bunch of angled brush perfect for gel eyeliner. This arrived super fast and in great condition. If you&#x27;re on the fence, go ahead and purchase. You can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing. No complaints at all. I use it everyday.  The pouch is a little bulky, but that&#x27;s because there are 22 amazing brushes inside. Dope. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I thought the price of this brush set would make it an absolute steal, and the price was fantastic for the number of brushes you got. But to be completely honest, I very rarely ever reach for these brushes over some of my other brushes. The quality isn&#x27;t horrible, but some of them are odd shapes, or sizes. For instance, some of the shader brushes are a bit too big and fluffy for packing eyeshadow onto your lid. I do use the foundation and concealer brush more than anything else. If you are a beginner and want a number of brushes to practice with, these are of decent quality and would do the trick. But I kind of wish I would have just spent the money on one or two better quality brushes that I would have used more. The travel brush roll was very nice though.</li>
    <li> For starters the case that the brushes come in is wonderful! It&#x27;s very sturdy and the magnetic snaps that hold it together are really strong so you don&#x27;t need to worry about it flying open. It also has a small zippered pocket on the inside that I don&#x27;t really see myself using since it is so small. Now for the brushes. When you get them you&#x27;re told to wash them and I did. Of all 22 brushes I only had 1 (yes one) fiber fallout, and I&#x27;ve used them a few times and they have not lost any hairs at all. All of the brushes are amazingly soft, despite some of their densities, and some of them are quite dense. I love the face brushes. The eye brushes are amazing as well. There are so many different brushes for so many different types of things. If you can think of a look you can make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;As far as how they compare to mac or sigma brushes I don&#x27;t know because I&#x27;ve never used them. I wanted a good set of brushes and didn&#x27;t want to pay the mac and sigma prices. So for makeup enthusiasts like myself I think this is a good brush set, especially if you are just starting out!</li>
    <li> I buy very expensive brushes usually, and I saw this set and decided to go out on a whim and buy it! was so pleased with these brushes. they do not shed and do not break. they apply makeup so well and i will buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> Ladies I really do you will love this brush set as much as I did. I am not a professional makeup artist but trust me I do know my makeup and I have many kinds for the past three years now and I know I didnt want invest into a brush set that is expensive so I decided to order the bh comsmatic brush set and I am telling you all it was a big disappointment. When I receive this set I felt the brush head and it is so soft like the sephora or even the sigmas. I would repurchase this one again just to I dont have to buy any other kind! LOVE LOVE LOVE GIRLS</li>
    <li> I really wanted to get a Sigma brush set, but right now I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money for some of the full range brush sets Sigma had on offer (I&#x27;m an unemployed recent grad so I&#x27;m not exactly rolling in the dough). So, after reading reviews, I decided on this Coastal Scents set. I&#x27;ve been watching a ton of YouTube videos lately and I was looking for a set that mentioned the types of brushes I often see used in creating different looks, and this set has all that I was looking for  (specifically the angled contour brush, the foundation brush, and very small angled brushes.) I like that the set comes in a foldable leatherette case and I love the amount of brushes you get for the very affordable price point. I the brushes are also very soft and don&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap like some of the Elf brand brushes. I think this is a great product if you are looking for a complete set but are short on cash. Definitely would repurchase this (if for some strange reason I needed to).</li>
    <li> This was so inexpensive so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything very special but I was so surprised to find that I love these brushes! They are dense, soft and amazing.</li>
    <li> I am a pro makeup artist, read the reviews and bought this, and definitely some of the BEST brushes I&#x27;ve bought... and for the price, this is probably one of the BEST buys I have ever purchased regarding makeup supplies..  I recommend this to any and everyone, pro and amateur</li>
    <li> THESES BRUSHES ARE AWSOME, AND THEY ARE VERY SOFT. THEY MAKE APPLYING MAKEUP VERY EASY&lt;br /&gt;AND YOU GET ALOT OF BRUSHES FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> this is a great set for beginners who are just geting started in makeup, as you have all the necessary brushes and a few extras. i purchase one for myself and one for mysister, the price is very reasonable and the brand (coastal scents) is a very reliable brand. my only issue is that the packaging has a very processed warehouse type oder, that does go away over time, and also one of the brushes i used came off the handle on the first use. which maybe be an issue for some, but considering i have other brushes and the price of this set, it was alittle expected, plus all i have to is glue it back on. but other than that this  is a a really good product and i would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I just started Make up school that&#x27;s why I wanted something cheap n good quality, I didn&#x27;t want to take my high end brushes ...this are great they don&#x27;t shed I&#x27;ve wash them twice ...good quality has every brush you need, I even find my self using them when I&#x27;m not in school ...</li>
    <li> This product EXCEEDED my expectations. I planned on buying the MAC stippling brush which is $36.00,but decided to try this after coming across it on Amazon.I ended getting the entire set for less than the price of 1 MAC brush.It&#x27;s a hell of a steal, especially for the quality of the brushes.I wasn&#x27;t sure what I would get because of how cheap they were, but I ended up being blown away by the quality of the brushes. I have been using them everyday since I received them, which actually came a day earlier than expected(love that!) My only wish is that the brushes were labeled with a number or the type of brush it is, other than that, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> good brushes for a decent price the smell was a bit much at first but i just left them in the open for about 4 days then washed them in some baby shampoo and left them to completely dry over the next 2 days.</li>
    <li> At the price, this brush set provides tremendous value. Other said almost everything that is important about this product. There are several things about this product that stand out to me. As a whole the set is incomplete, but this is a \\&quot;brush set\\&quot; not a complete makeup kit. Reviewing only the brushes it actually came with that I use, this is a fabulous value product. However, the kit is missing several brush types that I use, so it is by no means a complete brush set for me.&lt;br /&gt;On what it came with, some of my thoughts are:&lt;br /&gt;1) the synthetic angle brushes are better than almost anything else I tried for gel eyeliner. They are thin and stiff, the two features required for a sharp line. I prefer these to my 266 brushes for gel liner.&lt;br /&gt;2) The big angle blending brush thing is very nice, and just as good as alternatives from other brands.&lt;br /&gt;3) the fan brush is completely functional for applying powder highlight, and works well for that. I&#x27;m not sure what else I would use it for.&lt;br /&gt;4) it comes with a variety of eye shadow brushes in at least 3 sizes, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;5) there is a variety of eye blending brushes in the set, however none are a good alternative to a puffy blending brush like,for example a 217 (or its other brand alternatives).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the set lacks a large puffy brush for applying powder like colored or setting powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the flat top white$black brush is useful for. It is not a replacement for a good stippling brush like the 130 and its alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is not a puffy eye blending brush (like a 217 or its similar alternatives). In fact, all the blending brushes in the kit are stiff. I would prefer to have a range of eye blending brushes rather than the same style in slightly different sizes</li>
    <li> Cant complain.. they are truly what I wanted..they are so soft  I am hard to impress but I was.. for the price it was worth it and more..</li>
    <li> This set has been the best I have ever bought! Completely satisfied Truly does have all the brushes you really need and will use. Great price, it got here a little early and that was a plus:)</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister, who has never had a full set of makeup brushes, good/bad/indifferent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup and brush snob, so I wanted to make sure she got something great but inexpensive for her first set, and these fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the brushes on her with some of my makeup, as well as with hers, having tried several looks to test all of the brushes with different types of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they were almost too soft.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the makeup (i.e. shadow, blush, and powder) didn&#x27;t hold onto the brushes as well as they do to my sigma and MAC brushes, but that&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;The liquids and cream makeup (i.e. foundation, concealer, eyeliner) took to the brushes AMAZINGLY and blended out flawlessly!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a firm believer in &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Very little shedding if you wash with a mild shampoo like baby shampoo. Keep the metal and handles dry at all costs so as not to loosen the handles.</li>
    <li> much wanted by daughter who is a make-up expert-not me.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!</li>
    <li> These are good. But after washing them with the sigma spa brush cleaner they start to break easily. They shed everywhere.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it! High quality (according to her)</li>
    <li> Beautiful and fast delivery Thanks</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re gonna buy brushes , please don&#x27;t hesitate on purchasing these here !!! I LOVE THEM I CAN&#x27;T SEE ANYTHING wrong with these I love the way they look feel and the job they get done !!! I&#x27;ll probably buy more of these</li>
    <li> So far so good. I am a certified Makeup Artist, and to me the variety of brushes and sizes is awesome!  Particularly the 3 angled brushes and  the detailing brushes. The brushes are very soft and appropriately dense.  There was a little shedding when I first felt them all. My only complaint is the brushes lack numbers labeling each one AND this set doesn&#x27;t include a dome blending brush!</li>
    <li> Love this brush set. Great value!</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. I&#x27;ve finally written a review after purchasing it 2 years ago! Some of the brushes(like 2 or 3) broke off the handle but superglue can fix that issue. I personally dont use and of the brushes to apply foundation but the brown bristled brush (the angled blush brush or contour brush) in the set sheds like crazy to the point i threw it away. The eye brushes blend and work flawlessly. it&#x27;s a good buy for a beginner but as far as i&#x27;m concerned i would of just bought the eye brushes and concealer brushes and maybe the fan brush too...</li>
    <li> Love this brushes.. definitly a good balance between price and quality! It was a good purchase, they look and feel very professional like others more spensive..</li>
    <li> After doing a lot of research and working with my budget, I was pleased to find 22 brushes for a reasonable price. As soon as I took out the leather case from the box, the smell hits you like a brick. It&#x27;s pure gasoline. I don&#x27;t understand what they did to treat this leather or pleather, making it smell like gasoline! Seriously, an instant headache. The brushes themselves do not smell, and were packaged nicely and super super soft. I&#x27;m just disappointed because one of the factors of my purchase was the carry case and I&#x27;m disappointed that its so stinky that its unusable.</li>
    <li> I use the brushes every day. I can&#x27;t compare them to high end brushes because before these i owned 1 sonia kashuk brush and an e.l.f. Brush. I love these they don&#x27;t shed, they&#x27;re dense, and they give me a flawless makeup application. They may be cheap but there&#x27;s nothing \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; about these. Get them!!</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the cost value.  I don&#x27;t need 22 brushes however the ones I do use I have fallen in love with.  The fact that I have more than I need means I can play around with the others to test new looks.  I love the case b/c it&#x27;s easy to keep my brushes organized and it travels well.  They are easy to clean with a little soap and water and they dry fast.  No probs so far.</li>
    <li> I have a great set of expensive Sigma brushes and honestly, the only difference between the two sets is the weight of the Sigmas is heftier. This Coastal Scents set is a wonderful gift set for any girl of any age. They have a funny smell at first - I think it&#x27;s because of the holder they come in, but that dissipates over time.</li>
    <li> These brushes are of high quality and love the face brushes, they work so well I am thinking of buying myself a second set just to have!</li>
    <li> I am in love with these brushes especially because they are of amazing quality and are also extremely affordable. May I also add that I learnt about them from a makeup artist at mac who recommended this brand when I told her of my desire to purchase a good MUB set but that the ones at MAC were a little pricey.</li>
    <li> best brushes for the price. soft and long lasting..........they came apart after about a year but I glued the stick back on and it was good to go</li>
    <li> Brushes are nice and good quality.</li>
    <li> It has a lots of brushes and the quality is really good based on the price. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. Love the case that brings is easier to keep then organized!!</li>
    <li> I think if you order it online @ their website you get a few freebies, but I got 5 brush guards.  I really like the brushes.  When i first received them, I didn&#x27;t wash them first, and I put on some eye shadow, and the next day I woke up with a stye, other than that, this product is amazing.  Probably my fault for not being my cautious.</li>
    <li> They are very soft brushes u can&#x27;t beat the price for 22 piece brushes love it , there are some hair fallout other than that it&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the brushes but the packaging in comes in does not smell good! We washed the brushes before using</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have an awful smell.&lt;br /&gt;They pick up product really well.&lt;br /&gt;The handles of the eye brushes are long, which I love as it is much easier for me to apply makeup, the handles of the face brushes are quite thick which I think is great also.&lt;br /&gt;They do have a little bit of shedding.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes all came protected in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The bag is ok, the brush holders are a bit loose which makes it easy for the brushes to slip out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;The bag also has a small pocket that zips up.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for the bag much as I bought this for the brushes. So if you just want the brushes you won&#x27;t be disappointed considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my coastal scents brushes. They are soft, good quality, &amp; just amazing! DEFFIANTLY RECCOMEND! Also a great price for such great brushes</li>
    <li> For the price you get decent brushes. Some shed and fall apart easily but what do you expect when your getting brushes at such low cost? They are by far not the best makeup brushes or even good, but for the price they are well worth it if your just starting out with makeup.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good but some of them shed a little. Other than this, I haven&#x27;t found anything wrong with them. There are enough different shapes and sized to complete your look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no professional, but I am good with makeup, so I decided to go ahead and purchase a set of brushes for the first time.  This is a  nice set for the price.  The case is very nice and durable, and I haven&#x27;t lost any hairs from a brush since I started using them a week ago.  I noticed the plastic smell everyone is complaining about, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  News flash, they&#x27;re made out of plastic, covered in plastic and surrounded by plastic.  Just wash the brushes with your shampoo and let them dry before using, no biggy.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any streaking or issues that surround poor synthetic brushes, so I&#x27;m pretty happy about the purchase.  I&#x27;ll update if something changes.</li>
    <li> Fantastic and beautiful and varied brushes and with a variety of forms as well as the quality of the hair brush Join frankly, I was impressed by the way that you want to get it</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting this product to be small brushes. They were all large brushes and alot of them.&lt;br /&gt;I only returned this because it would not fit in my makeup case. So if you need alot of brushes and do alot of eyeshadow work on clients then get this!!!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY BRUSHES, THEY ARE REALLY GOOD, GOOD MATERIAL U HAVE A LOT TO CHOOSE FROM, IF U ARE A BEGINNER OR NOT ILL TOTALLY RECOMMEND THEM, IS A REALLY GOOD PRICE SUPER AFFORDABLE, N U WILL HAVE ANY BRUSH U NEED</li>
    <li> i do freelance makeup and needed more brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on expensive brands. I was leery at first about getting these brushes cause the price was so cheap but i watched a couple reviews on you tube and decided what the heck i&#x27;ll just get them. I was excited when they arrived. First the packaging was very nice and secure. Some reviews complained about the smell of these brushes but i think it was just the case they came in and not the brushes themselves. Although I don&#x27;t use the case the brushes came in (because I use another brush holder) it is still very nice and looks and feels good. Next about the brushes. There are so many brushes to choose from. There is a brush for everything you need: Powder, foundation, concealing, eye shadow, brows etc. Also the brushes are super soft and applies makeup very well. I just did a brides preview yesterday using these brushes and at the end the bride loved how her makeup turned out. I plan on buying 3 more sets of these brushes: two for me and one for my mom. I highly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> So in love with this brush set. Beautiful, soft and everything good. Thank you for the speedy deliver. My sister is a contestant in the Miss Teen Texas Pageant this yr and she will be taking this set with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instagram @raealey ;)</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. As a listened Make-up artist, I&#x27;m constantly trying new makeup and new makeup tools. These definitely get the job done. Although the do have a plastic like smell, once you wash them properly and spray a little perfume on it, the smell goes away. The big fluffy brush came apart bit I snapped it back it which was a little disappointing. But overall good brushes.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with my brushes. No smell. great application. great price. If you plan to get other Coastal scents products though, i recommend getting it from their site since you get points allowing you to save money on purchases.</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful package! they are so soft and pretty! I am definitely buying these again sometime soon! Love it!</li>
    <li> I use alot of coastal scents products but never the brushes. i had to get a new set after my old ones wore out and i dont regret this purchase. the brushes are sturdy and well made, never had any hairs come undone or end up in my make up or face. i was them alot, especially the foundation brush. but they hold up fine. had them for almost a year now.</li>
    <li> Good deal for the money!  You will have every type of makeup brush available at your finger tips. Great buy!</li>
    <li> The brushes that came in were not the ones stated online. They&#x27;re still good, but some brushes are duplicated or replaced with others.</li>
    <li> And I actually bought this brushes along with me, it was very helpful not to have  1 brush for every shadow. :-) plus the faux leather organizer keeps the brushes in order.</li>
    <li> Overall very satisfied with this purchase! I usually just buy a simple makeup brush set from Mary Kay, and now I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;ve been missing out! I&#x27;m no make up guru, but his is more then enough! Great quality.</li>
    <li> Great as a starter set. I really loved the case -- it&#x27;s great to travel with. All the brushes won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES. they are the perfect variety for those who are getting more interested in makeup (past a beginner level) and they work INCREDIBLY well. i doubt sigma brushes would top these .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if your scrolling through reviews and would just like a brief summary of my review on these here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are absolutely amazing. there isn&#x27;t anything whatsoever wrong with them and they are a perfect variety set with every brush u would ever need.  if i were you I would stop scrolling through reviews and GET THEM. you wont be disappointed.  I looked through all the reviews and finally ordered them and honestly i wish i wouldve ordered them months ago. they are seriously perfect. dont even listen to any bad reviews. theres like what 10 bad reviews outta 200 something good ones? ya case closed. get the brushes. u wont be sorry:) and the price is amazing! sigma brushes are atleast 15$ each and these are around 1.5$ each for 22 of them and only 35 dollars. plus the quality is the same as sigmas. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET THESE BRUSHES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you would like more details then here you go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why i got them-  Im getting past the beginner stage of makeup and was finding my 6 basic brushes (while good quality) weren&#x27;t offering the variety i was starting to need. i wanted a flat top kabuki brush and highlighter brush and eyebrow brushes and blending brushes and i SCOPED OUT all of amazing for the &amp;#34;perfect pack&amp;#34; of brushes. and let me tell you these are them!!!!!  I would think they are the same quality as sigmas if not better! i am so happy with them.  I will update my review in 3 months so you can know how the quality is staying but honestly i expect to have these for a long time. the quality is amazing and they apply your makeup FLAWLESSLY! I&#x27;d say if your getting past the beginner stage in makeup this is an amazing pack for anybody looking for the right about of brushes.  there arent too many and i can see having a use for every one of them.  they make doing ur makeup so enjoyable haha.  i went through all the reviews and decided why not. and im so happy with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why these brushes over others-  first i was looking at a really cute set of about 15 or so pink brushes with white hair.  then i realized that they might be cute but the reviews werent steller plus there wasnt a good variety of brushes. so i kept looking.  i couldnt find any in my price range that had a good variety, good reviews and good quality.  then i found these! first i was very impressed but all the info they give u.  they tell u how to clean them (which i found super helpful) and the purpose and number of each and every brush with a close up of the head of each brush.  i was very impressed.  the deal (while i was looking for 20$ or so--im cheep ik) was still very good since it was coming to about a dollar 50 per brush.  i saw every brush i ever wanted in this pack.  and let me tell you the qaulity is priceless.  the other sets i was looking at either had questionable reviews or just from looking at the picture didnt have good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the legendary smell- well for most people who gave this review less than a 5 they talked about the smell. so i fugred i would adress it to keep u from questioning it. first off, the plastic bag then the lether case came in was the thing with the smell.  the lether case didnt really absorb much of the smell unles u put ur nose right up to it.  the brushes didnt get any of the smell whatsoever and its not even there anymore after a day of not being in the plastic bag it was shipped in.  i honestly dont know why people would write a bad review because of the smell since it goes away within 5 hours of being out of its shipped package. honestly its a processed item, get over the fact if u put ur nose right up to it seconds after being out of its shipped container that it has a slight odor. plus the odor just smelled like plastic. not anything gross and it went away and the brushes never even got the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the brushes- i really do love them. quickly though just to tell you i think it is great that most of them are black with white tips or a darker color.  having the black at the bottom is perfect for not showing any of the dirt while the white tips at the top show u how much makeup u have on them..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cleanup- it recommended cleaning them once before first use.  i have been awful about cleaning my brushes in the past but i promised myself i would clean these good so they would stay fresh and nice.  i cleaned them how they said to (warm water and soap/ brush cleaner) then let them out to dry.  don&#x27;t freakout if some loose bristles come out the first wash (its completely normal).  the face brushes took over night to dry (which shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise considering how many bristles they have) and the smaller brushes took maybe less than 2 hours to dry. I&#x27;d say just wash them in the evening when u wont need them again til morning them let them dry out on a towel with the fan on.  it says to put brush guards on them but i don&#x27;t have any and they looked the same as wen i first got them wen they were dry so brush guards are not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;applying makeup- the makeup goes on perfectly ! there is a brush for ever type of makeup (liquid powder etc.) and they are all able to have liquid products used on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one con-i just wish the brushes were numbered. &amp;#34;coastal scents&amp;#34; is on every brush and i just wish the number could be too just so i could feel more professional but i really don&#x27;t care its just one thing i would love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really hope this helped. this is the first review ive bothered to write so i hope it cleared some stuff up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jms</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect! Between applying moisturizer, to foundation, to highlighting and contouring, to eyebrows and eyeliner,  they do it! I just washed them today for the first time, no shedding and they shaped back just the way they were before. I have tons of professional brushes and these BY FAR are my favorite. Very soft and applies all my liquids and powders beautifully. Happy customer! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the condition of these brushes! They pick up makeup really well and they&#x27;re thick. The brushes were a lot bigger than I anticipated, but they&#x27;re really good quality brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and have become my favorite to use out of all my others.  I wish each handle had the type of brush labeled on them also. The only place it is listed is on the box it arrived it.  That would make these brushes absolutely perfect.</li>
    <li> Standard affordable brush set - not pro grade, not crapola. I was a professional makeup artist at the time of purchase and got this for a friend who was just starting to use brushes so she could get the feel for what she liked before investing. She is still using the brushes from this set on the regular. So, if they don&#x27;t have heavy use these are great. I would imagine a few more cleanings and she&#x27;ll need to replace, but a fantastic starter set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Seriously, folks - DON&#x27;T FORGET TO CLEAN YOUR BRUSHES REGULARLY! Stuff that grows in there is naaaaaasty...)</li>
    <li> Now, calling this a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; would be the understatement of the year. No, these aren&#x27;t Chanel quality brushes, but are they close to pro brushes? Very much so! I have bought this as a gift for many girls I know. A perfect gift.</li>
    <li> Received this quickly and was absolutely pleased with the quality. I was iffy at first about ordering them but I watched YouTube reviews and decided to order them and so happy I did. The packaging is really nice but the case does have a funky smell at first (nail polish remover mixed with paint type of smell) but unless I&#x27;m purposely sniffing it I can&#x27;t smell it now. The smell did not stick to the brushes that I noticed. Super soft and luscious brushes. Little to no shedding (a few hairs from maybe 2 brushes came out). Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews scare you away! Definitely worth it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This set arrived on time and it is a beautiful makeup set.  I have not used it as yet.  However, one downside to having this set was that the brushes are not labeled.  My cousin just bought a brush set  (e.l.f) and all the brushes were labeled e.g. blush brush, angle brush etc.  This labelling would be very helpful for persons who are now entering the world of makeup  and  need the extra help with figuring out which brush  to use for a particular application.  Maybe the manufacturers would consider this helpful labelling in the near future.  Yes I would purchase  another set if the labelling is done.</li>
    <li> Teen says this is a good set with all the brushes she needs. Arrived quickly and she was happy with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality! Good precision brushes for eyes. My favorite was the flat foundation brush and the face brushes in general! Just awesome!</li>
    <li> As a professional make-up artist, I continued to hear about this brand of brushes.  I was very nervous about the low price but was blown away when they arrived.  These are top quality brushes, at an amazing price. Great for a new mua just starting out or a professional with a large clientele.  Just about every brush you will need is included in this easy to travel kit.  LOVE THEM and definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have actually purchased this same set 5 times for myself and gifts for my best friend, daughter and two god daughters. They are the best brushes for the price. They actually have held up better than some of my much more expensive brushes. They angled eyeliner brush is by far my favorite brush and gives me the perfect winged eyeliner. I use a gel liner and have to wash this brush extensively to get the makeup out of it. it holds up beautifully and after years I have not had to replace it. DEF will buy this set 100 times over</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush set for people just starting out or needing a whole range of brushes. I started really getting into make up this past year, but didn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on high-end make-up brushes. This set is perfect for me, some brushes I prefer to others but it covers all bases. They are so soft and haven’t had any hairs falling out. Can’t go wrong with that price tag either.</li>
    <li> I Like....This is very good!!</li>
    <li> great bang for your buck! great quality brushes! I especially love the eye brushes</li>
    <li> i am soooooo happy about these brushes the look and feel amazing. I cant wait to use these. They do come with a smell tho but i dont mind but the quality is really great and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> The synthetic brushes are great, they pick up material great and are a breeze to clean. I would still invest in higher end brushes but for starters, this set is great!</li>
    <li> Great great great starter kit!!! Only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 is because one of my brushes broke but I can replace it easily! Perfect for new learners has pretty much every brush you&#x27;ll need plus or minus depending on what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish. You cannot go wrong with this kit</li>
    <li> This brush set is fabulous!!!! Such a great price, and I use them every day!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE themmmm!!!! I have a lot of good quality makeup brushes and this is no less quality!!!! I would absolutely buy them again!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the price is perfect!!!! I recommend this for every female.</li>
    <li> These are real great brushes.  I was a little concern that the brushes handles wasn&#x27;t long enough but it totally was.  The brushes are real soft and I love how light weight it feels in the hand.  I did experience some hair fall out but then again it&#x27;s a new set so hopefully is will stop.  It has a great combo of brushes and the only thing is that I got 3 slanted angle eyeliner brushes.  They are all different size but I read that some people didn&#x27;t get any angle brushes.  I wish that is did come with a lip brush.</li>
    <li> OMG it&#x27;s even batter than the image i was so shock with this brushs i give it to my sis and she love it alot can&#x27;t wait to see how amazing it look like ! i love it.. thanx a lot</li>
    <li> Brushes fill super soft.  The fan brush is quite big, very interesting.  Super complete set.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes awesome shipping came very fast so excited for these brushes!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush kit. Can&#x27;t beat the price and everything works great.</li>
    <li> SOOOO Soft! Great quality. Applies makeup well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are absolutely amazing i read a lot of reviews and when something is to good to be true i second guess it but when these brushes came in (by the way in came in TWO!! days after i ordered it) i think that was crazy in a good way.. but back to the brushes they had no smell whatsoever and all of them were shape perfectly.....but one hair on the brush did come out but it was no biggy things like that happen....when i first did my makeup i was soooo shock they were sooo soft and it left my face with a beautiful finish... the one downside is there no names on the brushes so its very confusing to know which one to use....but when you get use to them you&#x27;ll know.. if you want good quality brushes for a affordable price definitely definitely get these brushes.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes I just wish I knew which brush did what like I wish they were labeled with a number or something. But great brushes!!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for they are super soft and the carrying case is pretty cool but brushes do shed.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this value. The variety is great, so you can accomplish any look you want with just these brushes. It is perfect for beginning a brush collection or expanding an existing collection. Some of the brushes are very unique, and they are all useful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the set! I was serching forever and everywhere to have a good case and brushes at ssame time. Brushes are soft to face and case is super cool. It holds the brushes in place and now I dont have to worry about storing my brushes somewhere else. Reccomend this 100%!</li>
    <li> MY FAV  BRUSH SET I USE THESE BRUSHES EVERYDAY AND THEY ALL WORK VERY GOOD! I WOULD DEF RE PURCHASE</li>
    <li> You get all the brushes you need for all your products. Love it.</li>
    <li> Amazingly soft. I have bought this for myself and 2 other makeup lovers and they absolutely love this. My only wish would be if these brushes came with the name and number but overall they are amazing</li>
    <li> I have used drug store brushes and high quality, for the price you really can not beat this!  All the brushes are well constructed and apply makeup beautifully.  I would highly recommend these for anyone looking to buy professional grade brushes and not breaking your bank!</li>
    <li> Great set my wife loves them and has had no complaints from her clients. Recomend to everyone who does free lance makeup!</li>
    <li> They are amazing for someone who needs so decent quality brushes for cheap.  I would recommend them to anyone just starting out with makeup.</li>
    <li> I love this brush set!  I the rounded foundation brush is perfect for blending foundation in easily and quickly.  A lot of my favorite brushes are from this set.  I am very pleased with this set and the roll itself!  I use this for travel and other things.  Would totally recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING!!!! I don&#x27;t really have a very extensive background with makeup brushes, but these are great, in my opinion. They hold makeup very well and apply just the same. None of the brushes have shed at all, yet (which is the problem I had with my previous set).  I&#x27;ve only had the set for about a month and a half or so, so it&#x27;s still kind of early to tell if they will last a while. But so far they are great! I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am very, very, very happy with my brushes!!! This is a must buy! I bought one for my mom as a gift and one to my cousin!!! I love it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am currently a beauty consultant for a large cosmetic company and was in need of better brushes. I was extremely nervous in buying this set especially because its online and I can&#x27;t actually feel the brushes. However, my best friend bought this set for me for my birthday and I absolutely love it! Every brush you could possibly need is here and the case is extremely durable and the slots are versatile so over time, you can even use other brushes and they will fit in the slots. Plus there is a little zipper pocket on the far left interior of the case so I can carry a couple eye shadows or whatever I need for travel. Love this and definitely recommend it for others!</li>
    <li> awesome brushes! very soft and professional at a great inexpensive price with a good selection of brushes. Trust these reviews and buy them!</li>
    <li> Came fast and in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve seen some complaints about the smell of the case it came in. I definitely notice a smell but it isn&#x27;t as bad as I imagined. It&#x27;s barely there. Really happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> Excelent !! Very nice presentation.. It has all that i need and more for My make up.</li>
    <li> pretty good brushes quality is OK. sheds like a motha...</li>
    <li> Great quality, really strong brushes. I love my brush set and would recommend this set for beginners to get acquainted</li>
    <li> I decided to get this set after researching a lot, and I was not dissapointed. The brushes are soft and perfect for blending. 100% RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> I love this brush set for the price I paid. It&#x27;s amazingly soft. And it was delivered it to me very quickly. Great!</li>
    <li> According to the market.  I thing this a one of the most complete one.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good and they are good quality</li>
    <li> I am not a professional or anything, but since I got these my make up style has improved a lot and applying make up seems so much more fun and easy. Also learned how different brushes do different things and wow yeah you get a lot of them too.</li>
    <li> Anyone who uses makeup would be so happy to get this set of brushes. Very good quality and the shipping was fast.  If you are thinking about purchasing, you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Just wish they could have put somewhere what each brush is called. I had to google some because I had no clue what they were used for. Other than that, perfect</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! I&#x27;ve compared these brushes to the brushes that I have now from Sally&#x27;s and they look and feel to be of superior quality. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> LOVE these brushes they work perfectly! They feel and look wonderful. Picked up eye shadows very well. :)  Would recommend these.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I&#x27;m an avid makeup user and these brushes have been holding up well. The case is handy too.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for a Christmas presant.  She still raves about how good the brushes are and the wide selection of them.  Definately worth every penny!!  5 star rating! * * * * *</li>
    <li> If you are looking to create a more professional look with your makeup this brush set is absolutely perfect!!  I expected the brushes to be good but they are better than good. They are very well made and there is a brush to create just about every look. I have not experienced hair falling out of the brushes either. Some commented about an odor but I did not experience an odor, just great brushes. I love them and use them every day which says a lot because I am a picky person and hate poor quality. I will eventually replace my set with this same brush set when and if the time comes. I almost purchased the more expensive Sigma brushes but read a customer review on these and decided to try one more time with a less expensive set...turned out to be the right decision. Thank you to whomever that customer was. Do yourself a favor and give these a try first before you overspend unnecessarily!</li>
    <li> I got these as a wallet-friendly alternative to the sigma brushes I&#x27;ve been eyeing. The brushes are good quality and selection. You probably won&#x27;t need to buy any other brushes with this kit unless you&#x27;re a pro make up artist. There&#x27;s a brush to help you achieve any desired look. Unfortunately I got a damaged brush. The blush brush has glue in the bristles and I&#x27;m really disappointed. It&#x27;s not worth it to me to send it back because I love all the other brushes but still annoying. No one else seems to have this problem though so looks like I&#x27;m the luck outlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is cheap in quality but it should hold up fine; it would be better if the case didn&#x27;t try to look like leather. It&#x27;s also quite bulky with all the brushes inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase despite the flaws.</li>
    <li> First of all I would like to say that his product is great and I would highly recommend it. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it full 5 stars is because of the fan brush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the other review that complained about the shape of the fan brush. I&#x27;ve hoped to not be my case as well, but it did came a little twerky. I&#x27;ve even tried to shape it correctly by washing it and molding, but it didn&#x27;t help so much. It stills does its job, but the ends are a little bit all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;But I still recommend this set. I guess Coastal Scents could be a little more careful with the packaging of the fan brush, but otherwise, great purchase.</li>
    <li> the brushes are so soft and smooth.. totally in love with this brush set.. no fall out hair and are equvivalent to MAC professional brushes only thing is u wont pay hundreds of dollars</li>
    <li> I ordered two brush sets.  The quality of the sets was poor.  In one set, the sponge eyeshadow brush was missing and in the other set the fan brush was misshapen.  The brush case is lovely though!  I think this company should work harder to ensure consistent quality in their product.</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas present and she loved it! She liked it that the brushes were so soft.  Liked the case</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with the quality of these brushes. I have had no issues with shedding during initial uses and am amazed at the quality. for those who need guidance on what to use each brush for, here is a index that was found through Coastal Scents. Enjoy!    [...]</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was sooooooo hesitant about buying this brush set because the last set I bought online were a complete waste of money. Anyway, back to this set, they were very securly wrapped, the case is leather and its so sturdy. The brushes themselves are AMAZING. I seriously have all kind of make up brushes Sonia Kashuk, MAC, Sephora, all kinds from every where. but these brushes are a MUST BUY! if you&#x27;re on the fence, just give them a try you will not be disappointed, they are full and fluffy, don&#x27;t shed (just washed them.) and they gather a lot of product and blend it out really beautifully. I am so happy with this set :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! i love all of the brushes and it&#x27;s such a good deal. Totally a must have!</li>
    <li> I have a makeup blog and I&#x27;m always raving there about these brushes. I&#x27;m not a professional makeup artist or anything, but I&#x27;ve always loved makeup and I&#x27;m pretty good at it. Also very proud to be self taught! With that said, I love these brushes. They are good quality brushes and mine don&#x27;t shed at all. I take good care of them, washing at least once a week with a special brush shampoo. I love the variety of brushes and I love how on Coastal Scent&#x27;s original website, they tell you the function of each brush, as well as the material they&#x27;re made of. Long story short, the bigger brushes are synthetic material, and the smaller brushes are natural, most of them made out of pony hair.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend these brushes to anyone who loves makeup. And it&#x27;s also a great first set to anyone who&#x27;s just starting to appreciate makeup and want a good quality set. Good luck!</li>
    <li> i think this is a really great brush set, no shedding so far... cant wait to test it out... shipping was prompt and i am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> It does have a smell, but that goes away in 2-3 days. The brushes are GREAT quality - esp for the price.</li>
    <li> great selection of brushes for the price</li>
    <li> Love it! The brushes were better than I expected!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a while and they lasted pretty long. Good set. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Just got this set and I love it! I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, but I&#x27;m definitely a makeup-lover. I always wanted a full set of good quality brushes, but I&#x27;m not willing to spend $20-50 per brush. Decided to try this set after reading reviews and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The brushes are soft and full, they all come in protective sleeves and the larger ones have covers to hold the brushes in their original shape. The vinyl case smells kinda like paint, but I&#x27;m just going to air it out, the brushes themselves don&#x27;t have any odor and I haven&#x27;t noticed much shedding (maybe lost 1 or 2 hairs when washing?). This set is great if you&#x27;d like a full set of great quality brushes without paying the crazy brand name prices! I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Greatest Kit! Def love it, I&#x27;ve had them for a year long now and they&#x27;re still soft and sturdy, not a single strand has fallen off. So, totally recomend it, it&#x27;s not MAC or whatever but they&#x27;re as good, I can assure u :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I do not get my make up done on a daily basis, often... But no everyday ( maybe from 2 to 3 times a week) like everything it all depends on how much u use it, but still for using them from 2-3 times a week during a whole year and still being in perfect conditions it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> The brushea themselves are awesome, I LOVE them. Would definitely repurchase. The only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; I have, if you can call it a complaint is that the brush roll, had a few cuts in the material that holds the brushes in place. I don&#x27;t really care, it doesn&#x27;t affect they way they are held into place, or the way the brushes work.</li>
    <li> Coastal scents brushes are very good quality with a great price. I have been using these for two years now and they are still in good condition. Take care of your brushes and they will be fine. My only complaint about these brushes is that the case really isn&#x27;t as good as it could be. It is flimsy and not really well made. If you are a pro make-up artist, I&#x27;d invest in a separate case to carry these around. The brushes themselves are excellent, though. The kit would be a tiny bit better if it had a lip brush and a bent liner brush, but you can pick those up for like $5 anywhere.</li>
    <li> My daughter really liked these.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend specifically requested this set. Great price and a great product for someone that works with makeup or really wants a nice set</li>
    <li> I washed them before use as recommended.All natural hair brushes in this set shed a lot.That would be 10 eyeshadow brushes and angle brush (5th from the left).Bigger brushes shed 20+ hairs smaller ones just a few.After they dried shedding continued.I dabbed brushes on a lint roller to remove loose hairs and posted a picture,to give you an idea how much.&lt;br /&gt;I think shedding stopped for now.I will update review if it changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to mention I got two  of these sets, one for me and one to gift and both shed the same.So I do not understand all  the raving about how brushes do not shed.I obviously did not get defective set since both perform similar.I washed and rinsed them by swirling on a clean plate,used E.L.F antibacterial  brush shampoo and dried them hanging with bristles down,so water does not get into ferrule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the good part.All of the brushes do what they supposed to very well.They pick up good amount of product and apply it to my liking.Synthetic brushes shed very little or not at all.Most are very full and dense.&lt;br /&gt;Large powder buffer is my favorite. I use it for liquid foundation.It is so full it takes over 24 hrs. to dry.I had to get second brush like that to be able to use it every day.One sold individually by Coastal Scents is $14.95.It is similar but even more dense and has slightly shorter bristles.I also like flat top buffer,mostly for powders but can be used for liquid makeup too.I would buy this set just for two buffer brushes and foundation brush, that I wish was bigger,but stil a good brush I use a lot,love it for BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case has faint chemical smell that goes away.In my opinion, it is something to be expected with anything made of pvc.I had brush set from BH cosmetics that smelled absolutely toxic for weeks, so this is nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the softest bristles I ever touched, but better than I expected from cheap brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few I would skip.Small duo fiber one they call round powder(3rd from the left) is very skinny,not my favorite.Pretty much identical liner brushes in 3 sizes I do not care for.Many similar eyeshadow brushes in different sizes, would be good for makeup artist, as there are different eye sizes to work with, but there are too many for personal use.Not the worst thing to complain about )))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be good to have names of brushes stamped on a handle, especially since Amazon does not have them listed at all. You can go to coastalscents.com and print it out,they have detailed description of every brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you can not get a better variety of decent brushes for $30.(3rd from the left) is very skinny,not my favorite.Pretty much identical liner brushes in 3 sizes I do not care for.Many similar eyeshadow brushes in different sizes, would be good for makeup artist, as there are different eye sizes to work with, but there are too many for personal use.Not the worst thing to complain about )))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be good to have names of brushes stamped on a handle, especially since Amazon does not have them listed at all. You can go to coastalscents.com and print it out,they have detailed description of every brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you can not get a better variety of decent brushes for $30.</li>
    <li> I have several Mac brushes but i was looking for more variety, this set gives you just that and more, genuine quality. These brushes work extremely well for the price they hold the perfect amount of make-up and give the coverage you are looking for, I especially love the contour brush and the powder brush, they work amazingly well, I definitely recommend this set, it would be a great gift to any girl who loves male-up and wants a set for all her needs.</li>
    <li> These is an amazing cosmetic brush set! I am so glad that I purchased this set because it has virtually all of the brushes that you need to create perfect make-up looks. The brushes are constructed well, and they are so soft. I am going to buy another set to keep in my suitcase for travel and another one for my best friend!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes about a month ago and I really love them!! They are absolutely amazing :)) one problem tho is that one of the brushes looks like they cut it with scissors.. but I made it work for me!! Other than that I love these brushes!! A must buy :))</li>
    <li> I have seen horrible brushes for an inexpensive price but DAMN these are so good! I LOVE how soft they are! They are also very durable. I received them in the mail a few days ago and gave them a quick wash and really brushed them hard against a dry paper towel and I didn&#x27;t see one hair come out! I was shocked! If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive brush set, GET THESE!</li>
    <li> Good Quality! - So worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend..</li>
    <li> I have been doing a lot of research for good makeup brushes since I have decided to do free lance makeup. I finally gave in after looking around I thought they were reasonable price for what everyone was raving about. They are good brushes not great. I have not had any shedding from it yet but the only disappointing thing I have to say is it was missing a brow brush but that&#x27;s not really a big deal to me but all the trouble returning it for another one risking I might get another bad batch wasn&#x27;t worth it to me so I&#x27;m keeping it I guess. Like I said if you are a beginner give it a try its not flimsy but its not \\&quot;professional \\&quot; set but you will make you feel like it with this set so you be the judge.</li>
    <li> Very nice to use. The brushes are good quality and the case is substantial and well made. It has everything you need.</li>
    <li> Great quality product, fast shipment!! Overall experience excellent</li>
    <li> I read the previous comments about this brushes from professional make-up artists and it&#x27;s not a lie, these brushes are like the high-end ones but reasonably priced! I&#x27;m so happy with the purchase and now my make-up set is complete! :)</li>
    <li> Love love these brushes. They came in only a few days! Very soft, they don&#x27;t fall apart!! Very happy that I bought them and the all of the positive reviews I read on them and watched on utube were spot on!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush set for all of your makeup needs!</li>
    <li> ok so I really don&#x27;t think these brushes are worth 30$ but they give you a good amount and a lot for makeup starters that&#x27;s a good thing but when you want to wash your brushes they will start shedding like a dog this is only for starter if your a pro in makeup I believe should find a better quality brush because if you easily like I am this brushes will drive you crazy and leave hairs on your face from th brush !!!</li>
    <li> I have a few random brushes from other makers, but decided on a mid range well reviewed set for my first brush set. I like these, I haven&#x27;t used the fan brush yet but the rest are solid. Some of them seem a bit better in quality than others, not entirely sure why. I washed them for the first time with minimal shedding. They definitely do the trick, in the price range they seem to be on the better end.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, i gave this a try on my husband s amazon account.They came fast, they look good too but i feel they are too many...some of them can be use for the same purpose.I guess with oractise ill use them all.&lt;br /&gt;They didnt shed at all so that was what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating beucause is a good product, and i think is necesary add some brushes.  But generally is good, i recomend this product for profesional make up artist.</li>
    <li> For the price there isn&#x27;t a better set on the market. The only thing you need is a 219 pencil brush from Mac because those just can&#x27;t be duped. Other than that this is all you&#x27;ll ever need and I&#x27;m a makeup artist.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I am NOT a makeup brush snob... most of my brushes that I have are from the drugstore, and the highest quality ones I have are the Sephora brand ones -- I generally don&#x27;t buy high-end brushes or spend a lot of money on them... so I knew these weren&#x27;t going to be amazing quality, but honestly this set is reeeeally bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the box these came in, I was met with a STRONG chemical smell. It was kind of like a plastic-y, vinyl smell, or some kind of chemical, I really don&#x27;t know for sure, but it was very strong and awful. I opened up the case and laid it out, to let all the brushes air out for two days. The smell was much lighter after that, but still kind of there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started playing around with the brushes... I noticed right away that some of them seemed dirty. I could see traces of dust or powder of some kind, like they had been sitting on a shelf and accumulating dust for a long time. It&#x27;s possible it might&#x27;ve even been eyeshadow instead of dust? Were these brushes pre-owned? I sure hope not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed right away that mostly all of the brushes shed. Some shedding is not a deal breaker for me, but three of the eyeshadow brushes in particular shed SO RIDICULOUSLY MUCH that I immediately just threw them away. The amount of shedding honestly made them unusable. These were some of the more fluffy eyeshadow brushes, meant for blending, so that was really disappointing, because those are the ones I would have used more often. That&#x27;s three brushes in the trash, outright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before actually using the brushes on my face, I decided to wash them first, since I was worried about the chemical smell, and dust/powder traces I found on some of the brushes. When the brushes got wet, the chemical smell got stronger. But by the time they dried, the chemical smell was thankfully gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as actual application of makeup goes... the quality is really hit-or-miss. The best ones in the set are the face brushes, particularly the flat top kabuki, foundation, dual fiber, and concealer brushes. Those are actually pretty good quality. The thin angled eyeliner brushes are pretty good as well. However, most of the eyeshadow brushes pretty much suck. I mean, three of them shed so much they were unusable and I trashed them right away, and the rest are too thin/flimsy to really control the product you&#x27;re putting on your eyes -- they end up not picking up enough product, or just making a mess. They are not dense enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, the &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; brushes (like the blush and eyeshadow blending brushes) in this set are terrible, whereas the stiffer, more dense brushes (like foundation and concealer brushes) are pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the leather case is extremely cheap. The snaps don&#x27;t line up properly, so it&#x27;s impossible to snap both of them shut at the same time, and EVERY time I open it, the fan brush immediately falls out (and sometimes a few others). That will probably go in the trash too, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am not returning this for a refund is that I plan on keeping/using about 8 or 9 of the brushes. $32 for 9 decent brushes is still a good deal in my book, even though I had some problems with them. I would not recommend these to  a friend, nor would I ever buy from Coastal Scents again though, sorry.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush set and for a price that can&#x27;t be beat! I did a lot of research and read reviews for what brush set to buy that was affordable and this is what I decided on. I&#x27;m so happy I did because they are easy to use and so easy to take when you travel. I didn&#x27;t think I needed so many brushed but I found a use for almost all of them, lol. I have had no issues with a smell, bristles falling out, or anything breaking and I&#x27;ve had these for over 6 months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of brushes a little reluctantly because the price seemed like too good of a deal for 22 brushes.  I am used to using M.A.C. brushes, and these are just as good! When they arrived, I had to trim a few excess hairs, but they are such a bargain for the price! If you are in need of a new set of makeup brushes I HIGHLY recommend these.  You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> I was referred to Coastal Scents and I love the products they have. The brushes was exactly what I needed to apply my makeup. I am very pleased and will continue to order their products from now on.</li>
    <li> I searched for months to make sure I was buying good quality brushes at a deascent price and there brushes are perfect. They have the firmness they suppose to have and do not shed even though I was them every night. I really recommend this product..</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I use top end makeup (mac, nars, urban decay.. you get it). I previously had a set of MAC brushes that absolutely sucked.. I bought these being very skeptical, but they were cheap and I was sick of my crappy MAC brushes. The quality of these brushes are great, I&#x27;m glad I bought these.. Definitely more bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> I do makeup professionally for a living, and I have used Sigma and Mac brushes but when I first started doing makeup I used this set. This set is amazing, I still use these brushes over my sigma and mac brushes. They last forever, never shed, and each brush in here is usable and gets the job done perfectly. The price is amazing and you may be fooled by it but honestly this is the best brush set i ever purchased!</li>
    <li> This case came in wonderful shape as some reviews I believe said their&#x27;s smelled.  Mine was delivered with no odor and I was amazed at how perfectly this all looked.  I like the plastic covering for the brushes so they keep their shape.  There&#x27;s a brush for any need you may have.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product.</li>
    <li> This is a functional and attractive product. The brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed. There are a good variety, though some seem superfluous. No complaints since I&#x27;d rather have extra brushes than not enough. The case is also nice and looks professional. The only addition I&#x27;d like is markings on the brushes (or a paper insert) that explains what each brush is and what it&#x27;s used for. There are a lot of brushes for a novice to keep track of, and instructions would be helpful.</li>
    <li> These worked out great. I only wish they had a eyebrow brush in it or else would have given a five star review. The product did have a strong scent but once you got rid of plastic that came with it and aired it overnight it was fine</li>
    <li> Nice presentation. A good selection of brushes for beginners.&lt;br /&gt; Two of the brushes in the set were identical. Other than that , I received what I payed for .</li>
    <li> These brushes blow my mind. They come in a nice package, they are super soft, and best of all the price ladies and gents! Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> Those are the best brushes eveeeeer!!! I never applied such clean, beautiful makeup such as while am using them! Tottaly recommend!</li>
    <li> I looked up a ton of reviews for this set on YouTube, I couldn&#x27;t believe the quality for the price. I definitely recommend it. I did air the brushes out for a couple of hours since it still had the factory smell when they arrived, and after a quick rinse with baby shampoo and some blowdrying, this is honestly the best make up tools purchase I have ever made.</li>
    <li> First review I have ever made on amazon. I&#x27;m usually the one reading them, not writing them! But I must say WOW just got these brushes in the mail today, and I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised, the makeup brushes defiantly seem like they are more expensive than what I paid for , very impressed and pleased with how fast they came, 2 days and they are here! Thank you</li>
    <li> I was very happy to receive my brush set, has plenty of room to add more brushes, They may not be the most high quality brushes they are very durable and get the job done. The selection they give you is great.</li>
    <li> initial experience with the brushes have been good, just started using them though</li>
    <li> Best brushes for your money, I&#x27;ve had these for over a year and they still look and work the same from I just got them.....would definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> Best quality(: worth all the money. Almost better than mac I think. Awesome the brushes don&#x27;t have any fall out. Great and easy to clean</li>
    <li> for daughter she hasnt tried them yet but she was happy to get them</li>
    <li> I love it, nothing else! Only issue, some of the little hair on the brush came off but it&#x27;s only certain ones. Otherwise, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Great brushes love them lots and for the price! Please can&#x27;t complain!!!!! Use them every day!</li>
    <li> I bought for myself and absolutely love them. These brushes are perfect! Many brush sets online or in stores with all the brushes you need generally tend to cost $100-200+ and if you&#x27;re not a professional yet most don&#x27;t have that kind of money for that. So these are a great alternative for nonprofessionals. 90% of the brushes were made with the optimal kind of bristles for its intended use which is great considering most companies sets use all natural or all synthetic so that half of them end up not working. These brushes are definitely worth the cost and a great buy! And also the the delivery service was fantastic! I used free shipping and they were supposed to arrive at my house about 3-4 days after i had ordered them according to amazon. But them much to my surprise the day after i ordered them they arrived at my doorstep and i didn&#x27;t even pick one day shipping. i am very pleased with the service and would buy these again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This is Rob&#x27;s daughter ;)</li>
    <li> They are great! Very good price and quality.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! Great price!</li>
    <li> A fantastic affordable full brush set , this set has everything you need. This is a great brush set if your starting out for personal use to starting to build your makeup artist kit. They are high quality brushes from a company that you can trust. You could do a full face of makeup with nothing but these brushes. They wash very well and don&#x27;t take long to dry they have kept their shape and I&#x27;ve had my brush set for around 2 years and use daily and clean weekly. I&#x27;ve even got another set I added to my kit to use on clients and I&#x27;ve never had a complaint about the brush quality these work very well. They pick up product like a dream and blend beautifully . I recommend these affordable brushes to anyone looking to start or expand their brush collection.</li>
    <li> Great value set. I use the majority of these daily. They are very soft and get the job done. The case it comes in is nice and sturdy. Great place to start off with and a decent set for expanding brush collections.</li>
    <li> As a makeup artist, I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of brush sets... from student kit quality to high end brushes. This brush set exceeded my expectations in every way. For the price, these brushes are exceptional quality. I wanted to use them for a few months before leaving a review because I use my brushes to death, so I wanted to be sure that they held up. They&#x27;ve been through dozens of uses and washes and look as good as the day that I bought them. The only brush I tossed right off the bat was the large fan brush, as it is too light to do much of anything with. The foundation and concealer brushes are fantastic, as are the shadow brushes. Virtually no shedding and they are soft on skin yet dense enough to hold powder well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were worth ever penny and I&#x27;ll be buying another set for myself, too.</li>
    <li> Wish each brush was labelled.  Hard to figure which for lips or detailed eye shadow.  Impressed with case.&lt;br /&gt;Most brushes very nice.  A smaller set would have been fine.</li>
    <li> Bristles already coming out of brush on first use</li>
    <li> Really happy with this brush set. Purchased for our makeup kit for makeup application in the salon &amp; on location for weddings. All of my makeup artists love it &amp; i am going to purchase one for myself!</li>
    <li> My initial thoughts on the brushes when I first opened the packaging was  they were well made. I ordered the bamboo color set and thought right away that they were very similar to eco tools which I like very much. As I started using them for application, I noticed some of the brushes won&#x27;t distribute product very well as they are not quite as dense like many high end brands. For instance, using the blush brush, even with the baked blush is difficult to apply on your cheeks. To be fair, I am not a make up artist so there may be user error in my part. Their eye brushes don&#x27;t hold too well for blending in my opinion. They are not stiff and dense enough to do the job. Now, I am looking to get a sigma premium set next year so I don&#x27;t get frustrated too much.</li>
    <li> There are a ton of brushes in here! The case is bigger than it looks in the pictures. I was surprised when it came how big it is. I&#x27;ve been happy with it so far! All of the brushes are good quality, even though I don&#x27;t know what they are all for.</li>
    <li> No wonder these brushes are sold out so regularly!! I LOVE this brush set! The quality is great! No shedding, well made and a ton of brushes for a great price!</li>
    <li> The brushes were good smelled a little and one brush was dirty. Other than that good set of brushes</li>
    <li> Love it! The price isn&#x27;t that cheap. I went to the coastel web site and they were $18. :/ but overall they brushes are great!!</li>
    <li> these brushes are really great quality for the price and a great variety aswell there are many cheaper brush sets with more brushes on amazon but if you look at the brushes you can see that there are many of the same ones and they arent not as great quality as these they shed maybe one or two hairs but i washed them before use so when i used them there was no shedding love them! even softer than my sephora brushes and even they shed</li>
    <li> Brushes are awesome. I bought a set for my cousin and she loves them too</li>
    <li> Bought this set to practice my makeup application without spending $100s on a pro set. I am highly pleased with the purchase. The brushes apply makeup well, the brushes are soft, and you don&#x27;t lose bristles when you wash. Just purchased a second set for a friend&#x27;s birthday.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set after much research. I watched videos, read reviews...you name it. There were wonderful reviews, some by professional artists and most of them were good. I got my brushes today and I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed! The brushes are soft, very good quality, and I noticed no shedding during washing. I haven&#x27;t used them yet as some of the larger brushes are still drying, but I went through all of my brushes and threw a lot of them out! I love the case, the protectors on the larger brushes, the feel, softness and density. For the money I spent I feel like I got a wonderful deal. They were much better than I expected. I recommend these to anyone who loves makeup. I&#x27;m no pro but I&#x27;ve gone through my share of brushes...from MAC to Sephora to Sonia Kushuk from Target. I see these very quickly becoming my favorites.</li>
    <li> I received these brushes for Christmas and I am in love! I normally purchase MAC and Sephora brushes, but I read good reviews on the Coastal Scents pieces so I requested them for Christmas! The brushes do shed; which I of course noticed with the MAC and Sephora brushes as well. The handles are very sturdy and they apply my makeup flawlessly! The brushes are very soft and clean easily with my ELF brush cleaner. I am very satisfied and will be sticking to this brand for the future.</li>
    <li> This is great deal! Shipped on time and in perfect conditions. It&#x27;s a little bigger than I expected, but over all a really good deal.</li>
    <li> Bought these for our three daughters for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They loved them and said the brushes were outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order one for my wife soon.</li>
    <li> I love the brush set!</li>
    <li> so many great brushes for an affordable price!  These are perfect for a MUA!  they are so soft but still pick up lots of pigment!</li>
    <li> The brushes were softer than I expected because they were so cheap. All brushes are nice and I use most of them but my only complaint is the lack of a large round eyeshadow blending brush. Other than that, this is SO worth your money!</li>
    <li> Case is sturdy, brushes are okay. A few of them are a bit prickly.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes they are so soft, but the problem is that the brushes are not evenly cut .</li>
    <li> I have to be honest, I work for a popular cosmetics company who is known for their professional makeup artistry brushes. After hearing a bit about Coastal Scents, of course I had to do some investigating and check them out! I ordered this set, and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed with the craftsmanship and quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can&#x27;t say that they are better than M.A.C brushes, because to me they are not, but these brushes and Sephora&#x27;s Professional line brushes are the closest ones that I have seen. I can see down the road the black paint on the handles may wear off a little, but that&#x27;s only minor in my opinion. I give these brushes a 4 star rating because you can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality that you get. However, there were a few longer hairs that I had to trim up a bit and I wish there were a couple more face brushes, and more user friendly eye brushes, but overall this set is not bad at &#x27;tall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good set for beginners/teenagers, people interested in becoming a makeup artist, but can&#x27;t afford the professional ones yet.</li>
    <li> Being a professional makeup artist I need a lot of brushes and am on the constant look for new ones it seems like. These are by far some of my favorites that I&#x27;ve purchased. The price is amazing and so are the brushes that come in it. I absolutely love the quality and variety that this brush set offers. Perfect for those who are starting out or need multiples. Will definitely be purchasing another set soon!</li>
    <li> These are wonderful brushes. They are soft and nice. I even purchase a set for a friend, who adores them.  If you are not happy with them give them to your little sitter,she will love them.</li>
    <li> love the brushes, good quality. and buying just one brush would cost more $$ at sephora/mac... well worth it. i would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> So I have been looking into a good brush set from youtube/Google and I seen that a lot of people used this set so I thought that I would look into them a little bit more and see if they was any good after a couple of days of looking around I thought that I would give it a shot I have amazon prime so my shipping was next day when they came they looked and felt great so I washed my face and started testing them out I have found that they are really soft and work great there east to clean and hold up well I will get me another set when I need. Only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the smell of the bag that holds them but the brushes do everything that they need and will hold up for a long time with the proper care of them I have had them for 1 week and I see no sight of shedding :) a must buy for makeup!</li>
    <li> As previous reviewers said, the packaging is pretty stinky. I&#x27;ve aired mine out but it still kinda lingers. Totally worth it though, cuz the brushes are great. They dont shed and there is a lot of variety. I flicked them all out, some had a little bit of white powder in them, but i was too lazy to wash them so i just used them after a thorough flicking and it didnt irritate my skin or anything.  UPDATE: 4 years later, I&#x27;m still using these. Love the Kabuki brush the most, I wash it regularly and it still hasnt shed and is still very soft.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these  brushes! They are great quality and won&#x27;t need any other brushes!</li>
    <li> I think these are really good quality brushes especially for the price! I would definitely recommend to anyone that wants good brushes but doesn&#x27;t want to a ridiculous amount of money!</li>
    <li> When I received these brushes I noticed a strong plastic smell (mostly the case), I laid them out over night and the smell became tolerable. I washed the brushes to try and get the remaining smell out of them and there was no shedding in the larger brushes, however the smaller brushes shed some. The two small black brushes bled a TON of dye when I washed them, I was unable to wash it to the point where there was no more dye coming out so I gave up after 20 minutes. Overall most of the brushes are not soft, I don&#x27;t like how they feel on my face, and the case still smells strongly of plastic after 3 weeks. I was not expecting MAC quality brushes for the price but I was expecting better brushes as described in other reviews. I will soon be purchasing a different set of brushes that are higher quality.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good quality for the price.  They&#x27;re softer than the Shany ones and more durable.  I had the Shany ones before this, and several of the brushes fell off the handles within a couple of months of use.  The Coastal Scents ones have held up longer -- even after washing them.</li>
    <li> the Case has a very chemically smell to it and one of the eye brushes sheds so much that it is unusable! other then that this is a great brush set for starters definitely with the price of it.</li>
    <li> Very soft. I wish I can with a larger/fluffier power brush but I can&#x27;t complain much. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!!!!!!!!!!! The best brushes I have in my collection so I&#x27;m pretty amazed on these brushes because I&#x27;ve bought coastal scent brushes before and they were trash so I&#x27;m happy i bought these and tried coastal scents again</li>
    <li> In love! They work great!!!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. It was much appreciated</li>
    <li> i LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush set! its perfect it doesn&#x27;t shed great quality comes exactly as pictured. I LOVE it, Thinking about buying a set for my personal use. I bought the 1st set to use on clients</li>
    <li> I was very excited about these brushes....I pre-washed them and even still each time I used them I had little hairs all over my face from the bristles falling out!!! frustrating to no end.....last time I will ever buy anything like these.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.  Ive had them for about a year and they are still holding strong.  The variety is fantastic, and it has pretty much every brush you could need for basic makeup application.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, and wonderful quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really glad I purchased this product. These are great quality brushes. I gently washed them when i first got them as instructed by the manufacturer and I&#x27;ve had no problems with fall out at all. The case is great because it makes for quick and easy storage. What I love most about these brushes is that there is a variety of synthetic and real hair. Synthetic for the brushes that you don&#x27;t want to absorb product (like the foundation brushes) and real hair for the brushes that you want to pick up the color (eyeshadow). They are also fuller and softer than most brushes sold in stores (Target, TJ Maxx, etc). The only &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; i noticed is the same smell you get with anything new and it goes away after a few uses. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mother and she absolutely loves them! She has used them everyday since Christmas &#x27;13 and they&#x27;re holding up. She recommends them to her friends all the time.</li>
    <li> awesome makeup brushes!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These makeup brushes are DEFINITELY worth buying!! I didnt realize how much of a difference my face would look just by using brushes that are very very nice quality. I was more than happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> After looking for a set of brushes that were not out of my price range I was truly impressed by these. What caught my attention was the case it came in and also the other reviews I had read on here and also the youtube reviews I had watched. So I decided to order them they came within 3 days and when I opened them I was completely satisfied. The brushed were great quality and I could not believe I payed under 40 dollars for a set of 22 brushes. If you are a beginner with makeup or even more experienced these brushes are the way to go they are more then worth the price and I do not have anything bad to say about my purchase(:</li>
    <li> This product is simply amazing. I didn&#x27;t expect to get such a quality for the price I paid. I have a sigma set for which I paid a lot of money and this is no different. The brushes are soft and they don&#x27;t shed I&#x27;ve used them and washed them many times and they are still like new. The purse is so nice and handy. Love them and I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to reinspire my love of makeup. Works great I can get a lot of detail done. Only one brush is loosing fibers, but I also use it EVERYDAY and wash it often. It&#x27;s great for self makeup applications or for applying to friend and family.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this brush set great quality! I was very surprised for the price how great they are. I will be purchasing another set for my pro makeup kit. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> These are such great quality for your money! I recommend these to everyone!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love these brushes especially after all the hype. When I got my brushes they arrived in what seemed like good condition. (I bought them from the coastal scents site). But not even a week of use and the bristles began to shed. My flat top kabuki bristles came completely out of the ferrel in one whole piece.  None of the face brushes held up, the handles came off even though I am really careful when washing and drying my brushes (I dry them upside down). The eye brushes were a little better. I also purchased some individual fluffy brushes from the site and those have held up fairly well. I guess you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s been a hit or miss with coastal scents for me. I wold recommend to look into real technique brushes or Sonya Kashuk brushes the quality is much better for the price. I recently purchased Bdellium brushes if you can afford the extra cash they are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This brush set is so so so so so so so AMAZING!!! I love the textures of the brushes and they&#x27;re so easy to clean. I don&#x27;t use every brush in the set but I love the lot none the less</li>
    <li> coastal scents - great ,high quality brushes.very soft, nice and convinient.normal price .it is really worth for this .recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Thin line between professional/very good quality. Foundation brushes don&#x27;t leave line marks. Either way I love it &amp; very beautiful. They are definitely worth the price. Thank you Coastal Scents.</li>
    <li> I not only found this to be a awesome deal, but they don&#x27;t shed. No itchy type anything. I have also washed them and they came out wonderfuly!!!!!</li>
    <li> as pictured and described, its an ok brush set, lots of burshes and useful, maybe too many brushes than you&#x27;ll ever need but you&#x27;ll use them at some point</li>
    <li> I loved all my brushes. I didnt know the product was so good. Its worth the price. Shoud have ordered more to give to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Great assortment. Brushes are sturdy and priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> Got these today, there is a strong oder coming from them. But when I took all the brushes out of the case and smelled them without the case it was considerably less. Then I smelled the case and that is where the smell was coming from. It is a nice case though. The brushes are very soft and when I tugged on a couple of them I didn&#x27;t get any bristles coming out, but I did notice on one brush a bristle that was slightly above the rest and when I pulled on that one bristle it did come out. The could just have been one that was not actually seated in with the rest. I love the look, feel and size of these. I plan on letting them set out and air out to see if the smell of the case gets better. If not I may get a new case for the brushes and not use the original case that came with it. I well check back with my review after I have had a chance to use them for a while. For now I would rate the quality at about 4 stars for the smell and the bristle that came out. These are very inexpensive so will see how they hold up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this brush set. They have a nice look and every client I have used them mentioned how soft they are. These brushes are a good buy.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter for Christmas. She is enjoying taking care of her hair with these items.</li>
    <li> They won&#x27;t be the best brushes in the world, but they are great. And especially for how much they cost, I was surprised with how nice quality they are.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been use this set of brushes all 1 year now. I use them everyday and they are pretty durable and almost no shedding when you clean or wash them. Love this set!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are really could and the case is they are in is sturdy and the brushes don&#x27;t shed.!</li>
    <li> all arrived in perfect conditions. They are SO SOFT I would make a coat with all the brushes. Nice set!!</li>
    <li> Edit: After several weeks of using and washing.  No change in my review.  There was some initial shedding from one or two brushes, but only during the first wash, since then, no issues.  I would recommend getting a few brush guards, mainly for the blush brush, to help keep its shape while drying.  Otherwise, still gong with fantastic for my review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this brush set after only a few days of use.  I will update this review after first wash, and maybe a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package, I will admit, there is a odor.  However, the odor is more from the brush envelope holder than the brushes themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onward to the brushes though....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, overall, the quality looks great.  Better than you&#x27;re going to get for any other brushes at this price point.  There are was no immediate shedding like I have had with some cheaper brushes out of the package (*cough* ELF *cough).  And the array of brushes is pretty fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fan brush.... I am not sure about this one yet.  It isn&#x27;t extraordinarily dense and the longer bristles feel a bit to flimsy to pick up and apply an appropriate amount of product, but then again you may want that in a fan brush because it theory you are using it for highlighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large round buffer/powder brush - OMG this brush is heaven on the face.  It&#x27;s soft and lovely.  I think it could easily be used to apply liquid foundation, it feels a lot like the Real Techniques brush for that purpose.  Easily my favorite brush in the collection and was worth the entire price of the set alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat style buffer, this is great too.  Supposedly good for liquid foundation, like the Sigma F80.  It does a good job with that, the bristles are very dense.  Much better than the Sonya Kashuk one from target that  paid eighteen flippin dollar for on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled brush, wow is that soft for a goat hair brush!  I am amazed! I thought I hated goat hair brushes but apparently I was just using bad goat hair brushes (*cough* ELF *cough*).  Great for blush/contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other face brushes, including the flat foundation brushes and concealer brushes are good too, although I don&#x27;t use flat foundation brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes - so many to choose from!  The doe foot blender alone is great, I have never had one before and apparently I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing!  The only thing I was disappointed with here is that there wasn&#x27;t a just plain nice sized c-shaped shadow brush and no fluffier crease brush.  However, fortunately ELF does make those two decently in their Studio line, so jump over there and buy them if you want.  The angled liner brushes are great too, and the varying sizes are a huge plus that many sets don&#x27;t bother with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Overall great quality, no shedding, nice selection, and the freaking price is outstanding&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell of the packaging, the lack of C-shape shadow brush and fluffy blending brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this purchase.  I recommend it to someone starting out with makeup looking to pick up everything at once.  Otherwise, you&#x27;ll end up like me, buying different cheaper brushes over a period of time and not being happy with them, then you&#x27;ll just buy this set or something similar and end up putting all your old brushes in a drawer or travel case and it will have been a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re really serious about makeup, I would suggest looking at Sigma, but maybe buying these as a spare set down the road.  I like having extra brushes for when my primary set is still wet from cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is my first complete brush set and I love it.  It has every brush I need and more. I am not a make-up artist but I believe in making sure my make-up is applied with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are soft and do just what I need them to do.</li>
    <li> Not a professional but I wanted great quality brushes and that&#x27;s what I got. The brushes are super soft and the face brushes especially are very dense. They shed very lightly hardly actually which is a plus. There is a scent to them when they arrive however with just a quick wash the scent went away. Over all great if you want a great variety of brushes for a reasonable price. Definitely recommending them to anyone that will ask!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I LOVE these brushes. They are very soft and they didn&#x27;t smell bad when I got them. There are a ton of eye brushes. I also have a brush to do every part of my makeup with out using any brushes from another set! This is definitely a great deal.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! I got them a long time ago and they still work great! Washing them is super easy too and they haven&#x27;t messed up in any way.</li>
    <li> Great set, decent quality brushes. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> for the price, 5 stars. sure there was a small amount of shedding, but the opportunity to work with this many brushes at this price point is justifying that. they apply my makeup and make me look great with no hassle.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super speedy, and my brushes arrived in perfect condition. The brushes are really soft, and I did not notice any shedding when I washed and used them. Would recommend these brushes to anyone starting to build their make-up kit (as I am), or for anyone looking for affordable, excellent quality brushes! So happy I bought these! :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for sister for Christmas, and she says that she loves it. She likes the way that the brushes evenly apply the makeup, that they are easy to clean, and the case they come with keeps them all neat and organized without taking up too much room. She highly recommends.</li>
    <li> I love ordering from Amazon rather than e-bay because I know that Amazon will ship the exact product that I ordered!  These brushes arrived early and in great condition.  I&#x27;ve used them everyday since I got them (after washing them) and there has been no shedding and the brushes are really soft.  This product is great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This is so so worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cheap but of high quality. They are soft yet stiff enough to do their job. No bad smell. They don&#x27;t shed as other cheap brushes.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous about the low price, but I was very pleasantly surprised once I had the brushes in my hand. The bristles are super soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they have a good weight and finish. only negative I can think of is that the set doesn&#x27;t include a fluffy blending brush.</li>
    <li> So happy I purchased this! Great product if you are just starting to use brushes when applying your makeup. It has everything I need. I&#x27;ve had them for almost a year now and haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out. I&#x27;ve cleaned them a couple of times and they&#x27;re still in good condition.</li>
    <li> Out of the box I did not notice a smell. The brushes are soft and none of them were malformed from packaging etc. Very pleased~!</li>
    <li> these are some amazing brushes! they are super soft and they DO NOT shed! It has every necessary brush you need.  i would recommend this to any up coming make up artist, it really does have the essentials that a mua needs.  22 brushes with a travel case for $31, you cant beat that. the quality of the brushes are really good.  the case does have a &#x27;plasticky&#x27; smell to it but it goes away fast just air it out.  it has a little pocket where you can put stuff in it. Bottom line, amazing brushes, cheap, and good quality.</li>
    <li> Very soft! Can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ve purchased many brushes and the price on these ones doesn&#x27;t match the quality. You get more than what you pay for. There is minimal shedding and none really after a couple uses. Plus comes in a great case to keep them in great condition.</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect.  They do not shed and are super soft.  I did not think I could get this good of quality for so little, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance on these brushes.  I&#x27;ll never shell out 100&#x27;s for other brushes from Sephora, Ulta, etc.</li>
    <li> The hair falls therefore I would not recommend it. Not good quality</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t in the market for a whole kit of brushes. I was about to buy a Giorgio Armani brush from Saks.com and went to another website for a review, and stumbled upon a review for these brushes. Since they were about the same price as just one brush I decided to roll the dice. Wow. They are very nice brushes. Dense bristles and soft. For the price it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the case smells very chemically. I will be taking the brushes outside tomorrow to air them out a bit. I know the smell will go away and am not concerned about them being dirty or what not. Yikes, the smell is strong.</li>
    <li> I have bought different brush sets on Amazon, and so far this has to be my favorite! Great price and great quality. The brushes are super soft and have little to no shedding. Really recommend this set for anyone!</li>
    <li> Ignore the bad reviews.. I got much better quality brushes than I expected for the money. They are better than any of my Sonia Kashuk brushes. They aren&#x27;t as nice as my urban decay brushes but fairly close in quality. People who complain we&#x27;re expecting way too much for the money.</li>
    <li> These are great!  No problems at all.  They didn&#x27;t have the smell some of the reviews stated. Giving it a four star only because the fan brush is huge and it would have been nice if it came with a mascara wand to brush out my eyebrows. But other than that, it&#x27;s really great!  Will be ordering a second set for my daughter soon.</li>
    <li> She loved these brushes and she is all about make-up.  Don&#x27;t know why except that she keeps raving about them.  As long as she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.  Besides, this lets me buy some cool games without a lecture.  Oh don&#x27;t you love married life.  Lol.</li>
    <li> My experience with these brushes has been awesome so far. I bought them about a month ago. I am a really picky person when it comes to online purchases. I honestly looked at this set  for over 2 months before I actually bought them, just to keep up with reviews and make sure they would be the right choice.  I have absolutely no regrets. Considering the price- these brushes are friggen great.&lt;br /&gt; Aside from these ones the other brushes I own are MAC, Lancome, and Smashbox, and the coastal sense ones are definitely comparable. The set basically gives you every kind of brush you need. I waited about a month before reviewing just because I wanted to see how the brushes would do after some time. I do my makeup every single day.  My hobby is experimenting and trying out different looks. So after a month and a few washes They seem exactly like they did when I first opened them. They haven&#x27;t shed.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase. I STRONGLY recommend them. If you are on the fence like I was at first- Just go for it. They will meet your expectations.  They are super inexpensive, and really good quality.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Only brushes you will ever need. Has every brush you need and more. Buy, you wont regret it!</li>
    <li> I use they daily. They were way cheaper then the name brand one and they don&#x27;t shed at all. I take them with me when traveling. All my friends compliment them and ask where I got them</li>
    <li> These brushes are phenomenal especially for the price. I get like zero shedding, and this set has everything you could need except a bomb bronzer/blush brush. I&#x27;ve had these over 2 years and the only one to give me any issues at all is the one I use like 10 times a day so the wear and tear is totally expected. Amazing value buy here.</li>
    <li> The natural brushes are good, the synthenic ones are okay.  The chemical stench, though, of that faux leather pouch was so strong and so invasive, I had to wash the brushes three times to try and mitigate the smell.  the brushes are worthwhile, but throw the case and find a better one.</li>
    <li> Use most of my brushes; however, a couple (more specific) about 5 out of them all shedded a lot.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Brushes are decent... there isn&#x27;t a good eye blending brush or powder brush, though. Foundation stippling brush is not dense enough and the hairs are too long. Other than that, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
    <li> Love my set of brushes! Quite soft, great quality and the price is just right. The case is pretty nice too, if you don&#x27;t have a place to store your brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome!  For the price, I cannot believe how many there are, and they work fantastically!!!! awesome value!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing. I just got mine in the mail today. I cant wait to use them.. totally worth the price I paid for.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the quality of the brushes... I just loved them!! They come with almost every brush yo can think of... Just a must have for all you make up lovers</li>
    <li> THE BRUSHES ARE ALL GOOD BUT THE STENCH OFF THE FAKE LEATHER CASE IS TOXIC I DONT KNOW IF I SHOULD TRUST EVEN HANDLING IT. iT SMELL TERRRIBLE. i FOR SURE IHAVE TO CLEAN BRUSHES WITH BOTH DAWN DISH LIQUID AND  BABY WASH!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even used every single brush in this set yet (almost, but not quite!) and I can still say I love it! Like other reviewers I do wish the brushes were numbered, but that is easily over-looked for the price and quality of the brushes!</li>
    <li> This set contained all the brushes I was looking for! (That was the most satisfying feature of this product). The brushes themselves are pretty good, best for starters (as mentioned in the title).&lt;br /&gt;On the brushes:&lt;br /&gt;- Liquid Foundation brush: a little too rough on the skin&lt;br /&gt;- Powder brush: a little on the firm side but not abrasive&lt;br /&gt;- Eye Shadow brushes: average pick up. (I.e. not the best pick up of pigments but it will suffice for everyday use)&lt;br /&gt;- The best brushes, in my opinion are: The stippling, eyeshadow crease and contouring brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> Nice brush set. They are very soft and they don&#x27;t look cheap. They have good quality, it is a very good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I got these haven&#x27;t used all of the brushes but very nice. They shed a little but not horrible. The case didn&#x27;t stink. Product came fast. I like all the options I have with this product.</li>
    <li> Recived them faster than from amazon.co.uk  I was very surprised. Brushes are very  good quality  some of them  made even better than  some of my mac brushes and Im not happy with  many of mac brushes because they loose their hair but cost extremely expensive. Im glad with my new  brushes:)</li>
    <li> Love this brush set! Grabs,  holds and applies products efficiently, is soft,  didn&#x27;t shed when washed,  shipped quickly and has enough brushes to do a whole face.  The only brush I had a prob with is the angled blush brush,  it shed after it dried from washing and I was being exceedingly gentle.  Not every brush needs to be densely packed and they understood this with their blending brushes. The brushes that needed to be densely packed were. The brushes only have Coastal Scents  written on them and I thought beginners could benefit from having the name of the brush actually on the brush instead of on the packaging.  The carrying case seems sturdy and not flimsy which is important. Overall I was very very pleased with these  brushes and would recommend them to a beginner or an experienced makeup user</li>
    <li> Not the best quality for the price.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend ordered this set for me as a Christmas gift this last year. I was so exited to try them out! I&#x27;m a big makeup junkie, and I&#x27;ve always wanted a big collection of brushes. When I first opened the package there weren&#x27;t any strong smells, the brushes were all intact, soft and I liked the case. I don&#x27;t have a problem with them shedding, they apply color evenly. I wash them about twice a month with baby shampoo and condition them. The only problem that I&#x27;ve run into with these brushes is that where the handle meets the brush head, it keeps disconnecting. I was washing a few and the handle popped out. I just pushed it back in, but I can tell it&#x27;s loose. I&#x27;m not sure if I got some water in the seam and it loosened the glue? But overall this set is pretty good quality and you get plenty of useful brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and good quality.  And for the price you cannot beat it. Need to buy another set though, because daughter just took mine!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a brush set for a while now I looked at the ELF and Shani ones before I decided to buy these and I&#x27;m glad I did.I wanted a really good quality brush set for beginner&#x27;s as i am no makeup artist myself I also didn&#x27;t want to brake the bank to purchase any MAC brushes cause they are so pricey. The brushes came in a cute black case when i first opened the case there was a really strong scent which I was already aware of since i read the reviews prior, i did like that the bigger brushes came with the hard plastic sleeves which is great fo keeping them clean from dust ect.... I washed them with some shampoo and let them air dry plus they did not shed at all like some other low quality brushes although i guess i&#x27;ll need to probably use them a little bit more to tell if they shed so I&#x27;ll update if it does so far I&#x27;ve been using them every day and i luv it.....</li>
    <li> This is the first set of cosmetic brush sets I have bought, and I am satisfied.  I bought this after looking at reviews and doing some research on brushes.  It has pretty much everything you will need, and then some.  I get way more compliments on my makeup when I use these brushes to put on my makeup as opposed to my hands or using the brushes that came witht he cosmetics.  I like that a lot of the larger brushes come with durable plastic covers to keep them sanitary.  The rest just come with disposable plastic cases to protect during shipment.  I havent had a problem with any of the hairs falling out of any of the brushes yet.  This was a good buy, especially for starters.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed! I have often wanted good brushes and don&#x27;t want to pay big money for each one. This is a great set well made and great price. maybe too many brushes for a girl that likes a more natural look or doesn&#x27;t experamint with a lot of ways to aply make up. I don&#x27;t know what half of them are for but still love every one i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, all of them were super soft and hardly any shedding. The smell was quite bad, but after a clean they smelled normal.</li>
    <li> The head of one of the foundation brushes broke the second time I used it.  Not worth paying the shipping to return it back so I&#x27;m going to superglue the brush back on the handle myself, hopefully it stays on. Very disappointed and frustrated.  Also the brushes have a chemical and plastic smell that lingers.</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my mom for Christmas and I wish I would have gotten myself a set too.  Great quality</li>
    <li> so happy with the brushes. The hair dont fall off like my other ones so far so good. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this deal</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes!&lt;br /&gt;High quality low price, just what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brushes even come with reusable plastic protectors.&lt;br /&gt;And the &#x27;case&#x27; includes a zippered pocket where you can store additional brushes.</li>
    <li> I liked the brushes, they all came nicely wrapped and packed, but I noticed that some brushes had hair falling.</li>
    <li> My favourite would have to be the flat top Kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;All brush are smooth and light weight, which makes it easy to apply make- up with.&lt;br /&gt;Helps give a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! My family works at MAC, so I do use a lot of their brushes, but these brushes are amazing for the prize. I have bought three sets of these, and used two of them as gifts!</li>
    <li> A few of the brushes were deformed, a couple of them shed excessively. I have heard a lot about the brand being of better quality than what I received. A few of the brushes are usable but so far they have not  made their way into my every day makeup routine.</li>
    <li> Brushes I received looked dusty and shape was deformed. Looked like they were smashed somewhere.  Also they smell very strong like plastic. Not happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for 4 months and these brushes work great!&lt;br /&gt;I love the eye brushes especially!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experience any shedding at all. I spot clean them after every use with a makeup wipe, and then deep-clean once a week with baby shampoo. Works well!&lt;br /&gt;4 months later and the brushes are still soft and they apply well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend them!</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews saying that the natural hair brushes in this set shed, but i decided to risk it and buy the set anyway. The synthetic brushes feel soft, and so do the natural hair brushes, but boy were those people right, the natural hair brushes shed! I hadn&#x27;t even washed them, I just opened the package and ran my finger across the brushes and almost all of the natural hair ones shed... If you can&#x27;t afford anything better and can live with the shedding, go ahead and buy these because they are still decent brushes. But if you can afford better brushes, I would avoid these and buy something else.</li>
    <li> My first brush set, they&#x27;re OKAY with blending and after washing I noticed that hairs are starting to fall</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes are amazing and well worth it For the pice I paid (29.89). I haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reactions (I have sensitive skin) nor any brushes shedding. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> these are great... i&#x27;m sure there are better out there... but this is the price range that i wanted to spend... i&#x27;m very happy with the quality for this price</li>
    <li> This brush set is amazing! Better than most of the very expensive brushes I&#x27;ve had. Don&#x27;t hesitate they are amazing!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Perhaps good for beginners. Or just to have an extra set. Some of the brushes are okay but definitely not great. I THOUGH am a professional make up artist so I know the difference between very good quality brushes. Some people might love them???? A few of them did break.</li>
    <li> This set is great! The quality is amazing for such a good price. I definitely recommend this brush set!</li>
    <li> I just love them. I am pleased in every way</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get these brushes after reading all the positive reviews and already owning the coastal scents eye palettes. However, despite the gorgeous packaging and  the many brushes they give you for a CHEAP price.... the tiny brush hairs were all over my face with just one application. It didn&#x27;t stop shedding and there is nothing more annoying than picking tiny hairs off your face. I have been happy with the EMAX Design makeup brushes that are really reasonable and they also blend well. The downside it you don&#x27;t get as many as with Coastal Scents.</li>
    <li> Great purchase great price amazing timing free shipping</li>
    <li> Love love love this set. Works fantastic. Have had it for about 2 years now with no problems. None have broken or fallen apart or anything. All you could ever need in this set. I use about 5 of them on a daily basis and the others occasionally/never. But they&#x27;re always there if I want them! Case is nice too. Would recommend this to anyone looking for brushes. I think it&#x27;s a much better deal than buying expensive brushes from MAC/Sephora that do basically the same thing.</li>
    <li> Some brushes are really good but others the hair start loosing since the first application. Overall it is a good deal, you are getting what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price and very soft!</li>
    <li> At first when I saw them online I was thrill to have them right away. The price is great, but the quality isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;One of the brush tip fell of on the very first day. The brushes sheds when I wash them. Lesson learned, I&#x27;ll never buy cheap brushes again.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes ALOT!!!!</li>
    <li> they shed but still use them</li>
    <li> Amazing! ! Compares to expensive name brands-- use them everyday!</li>
    <li> Every single one of these brushes sheds like crazy. I washed before using, dry bristles down, and store them properly with the sleeves in the original case. Still every single time I use them more and more hairs fall out. I would never buy these again.</li>
    <li> I’m new to applying makeup always watching YouTube tutorials to pick up tricks and ideas. I didn’t want to break my bank getting the MAC Brushes which many people have. I basically bought these brushes based on the Amazon reviews and so far love them.  There is a slight odor when you first get them but besides that great value.  I’m finding applying my makeup is so much easier and looks so much better from the brushes. Hope this helps</li>
    <li> Perfect brushes for when you need to beat your face. With these brushes I took my snatch game to a new level.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid. I am happy for the brushes. This is my first complete makeup brush set and most of them have been great, especially the foundation and blush brushes. The only disappointing brush is the large shadow brush which is like forever shedding. After a while i just gave up on it and use the medium shadow brush instead.&lt;br /&gt;My family and friends has noticed the difference in my makeup after using these brushes even though i am still using the same makeup products. The right tools really helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is very good set for beginners like me and is hesitant to spend a lot on branded makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Good brushed to start with. Good quality</li>
    <li> owned this set and also the Elite version of it. I prefer this one to Elite brushes. It has been over 2 years and I still use majority of the brushes on daily basis! The brushes are super soft and durable! They perform better than other more expensive brushes I have pruchased. I don&#x27;t use all the brushes in this set (no use for stippling nor fan brushes etc) but definitely the set is a keeper and worth your buck!</li>
    <li> These brushes work excellent for the price. My makeup looks a lot better and I&#x27;m extremely happy with thispurchase. We&#x27;ll see what they look like after I clean them, but so far so good! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great set of brushes. I would recommend and in fact will be buying for my oldest daughter as well. I had purchased these for my younger daughter and she loves them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with these brushes, they are the best I&#x27;ve used so far, great buy</li>
    <li> I use these brushes everyday, the variety is great! Some of the eye brushes are a bit useless, but they can be helpful to have around. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Great quality. The case is wonderful and gives you an easy breakdown of the brushes and what they&#x27;re used for.</li>
    <li> Love all the brushes and nice bag. Seems like good quality so far</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd 22 piece brush set. The first one is over 5 years old and still going strong. All the brushes are essential.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great quality for the price. That is the key, the price. These are by far the best quality for this price range. I find the fan brush not so good but the rest I love. I have high and low end brushes and it is true that some of these compare to high end ones. I have had them for 6 months and am satisfied because of the price. If you want better quality then I suggest the best ones out there &amp;#34;13rushes&amp;#34;, they are better than MAC and Sigma. Their prices are in Singapore dollars so make sure you do the conversion. But for someone wanting personal use brushes these are great. I haven&#x27;t had issues with bristle fallout or bad odor as other people said and I am extremely picky. I just bought a second set for a gift.</li>
    <li> Daughter so excited and happy with them. She can&#x27;t wait to use them all! One was shedding after a couple uses. I hope that isn&#x27;t a sign of what&#x27;s to come.</li>
    <li> I have been personal using these brushes for over a year now and am very happy with how the function and have held up.</li>
    <li> OMG... I am soooo happy with this brush set! came within like, 2 days and it&#x27;s totally awesome! (girly voice) haha Seriously, it is a great brush set; I also love love love the case!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got me these brushes for Christmas. And so far they are AMAZING. I recommend these brushes. Very cheap but great quality.</li>
    <li> After reading the comments and looking at many different brush sets I finally settled on this one.  Not only is the price good but so are the brushes themselves.  Now I can&#x27;t speak from a professional point of view since I am definitely not a professional make up artist.  I&#x27;m just your everyday average girl.  For me, I do my makeup maybe 3-4 times a week and so far I am in love with this brush set.  Before I had a few different brushes from e.l.f. and I can honestly say I will probably never buy e.l.f. makeup brushes again.  This set has everything I need and they are so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived before its estimated delivery date and in perfect condition.  Also a little plus is that on the back of the box it lists what each individual brush is made of.</li>
    <li> better then what I expected. Very happy!</li>
    <li> First of all, can I just say I am SO PICKY when it comes to buying products. I literally researched brush sets on Amazon for an entire week looking at reviews and comparing prices and products. For this product, WOW. For the price you pay and what you get, WOW! I got this brush set last week and am so happy with it. Yes, its VERY true that the case smells when you open it--its the material of the case. It honestly smells of strong paint, but I rolled the case out and let it air out for 2-3 days and the odor is gone. The brushes are soft, and you have pretty much every brush you need. Sure, if you&#x27;re a professional, you may find one or two brushes that aren&#x27;t included, but if you feel like complaining of the lack of brushes, go to MAC, SEPHORA or ULTA and try to find a bargain like this...good luck! The brushes haven&#x27;t shed but I did buy a brush shampoo to clean them (which I also recommend because its much cheaper here then in the store. Go to my other reviews to find product). So overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and it arrived quickly. SUPER SATIFSFIED.</li>
    <li> I checked reviews on so many brush sets on amazon, and these had the best reviews so I decided to get them. I am in love, they are extremely soft and gentle. They are well worth the money. Negatives are that they are not labeled which isn&#x27;t a huge deal for me; an idea if you need them labeled is to use a label maker and label them, and they have a slight odor which washes out. It almost is like new car smell but more plastic like. Overall the pros greatly outweigh the cons. Get these brushes!</li>
    <li> Love, Love the set and the price even better.  Comfortable and easy to use, the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that there were not label but easy to define which one is which and what is for.  The feel of the brushes is excellent and how they work.  Though that by being inexpensive they might not work as good as others but on this one prices is not what defined the brushes the feel and the work do..  Great brushes would definitely recommend to everyone that is looking for great brushes and inexpensive</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a college senior, my cousin who graduated beauty school has an amazing makeup brush set and I was so jealous watching her put on makeup using the brushes. Before purchasing these I owned only a few eye liner brushes and a powder brush. I applied my liquid foundation with my fingers and it worked at the time... or so i thought. I am in love with these brushes. yes sometimes they shed but I haven&#x27;t done the initial wash to them yet so I&#x27;m very satisfied. I have gotten so many more compliments on my makeup since purchasing these brushes. I know I&#x27;m going to have to hide them from my roommates. the price I paid felt like no major commitment yet I still expected the brushes to be high quality. I shopped around for months before purchasing brushes and this set had the most consistent high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence and are looking for just a good set of everyday use brushes I think these are the ones to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the set for 35 which puts me out about 1.50 for each brush. you can&#x27;t get brushes this good for a price anywhere near that!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m obsessed with these brushes and would strongly consider ordering more from this brand</li>
    <li> These are really good quality brushes. Sigma and MAC are better quality, but for the same equivalent brushes in those brands I would be spending anywhere from $200-$500, which is insane if you aren&#x27;t able to write them off as a tax deductible business expense.  These are the absolute best option for the woman or pro who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.  There are no better brushes out there that are of this quality at this unbelievably bargain price.</li>
    <li> I was kinda nervous buying this brushes because the price was soo good I thought maybe the brush set wouldn&#x27;t. But when they arrived they were just perfect very well made. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about a month now and only one of the 13 I&#x27;ve tried (there&#x27;s so many) has had any fallout - and very little at that.  They are all very, very soft.  Another reviewer suggested checking out the Coastal Scents website for the brush types and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Lots of info there.&lt;br /&gt;I was also glad about the smell warning.  They do smell!  I left the case opened up for a couple of days and the smell eventually went away.  Everything considered, I probably would have preferred a few less brushes for a lower price.  This is really not a big deal at all, considering the price is still fabulous but I thought I would mention it.  The case when full is pretty bulky.  Probably great for a makeup artist, but for me, just a bit too much.  All that said, I still love it and plan to keep the extra brushes that I&#x27;m not using now put aside to replace others as they get old.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic....I carefully read all the reviews...and decided to go ahead and give them a try....I bought three sets for myself and as Xmas gifts...I am so happy with this product....I have tried many brushes...expensive ones ....i am very picky with my brushes....because its a personal perference...usually i have to feel the brush in hand before i commit to one but  these are quailty brushes at a bargain.....22 brushes...a great variety for all your makeup needs...I usually pay this price for one brush....these are great gift ideas...any girl would love these!!!! Don&#x27;t turn these down ladies...u will love them!</li>
    <li> Excellent set, It is a very nice set, nice package and very portable it is a nice gift, mom is so happy</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them, and she is quite picky.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes and they are a good set for people who are just starting out with using a variety of brushes for makeup, but they didn&#x27;t last long and don&#x27;t have excellent quality...but are good enough for the price.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes, A lot better buy than the more expensive brand. I would definitely recommend these as a great quality brush set.</li>
    <li> For the price, you won&#x27;t find a better set of brushes. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I got these brushes a month ago and finally got to use them the other day (life of a stay at home Mom haha). They are amazing! The flat top buffer and powder buffer are my favorite brushes for applying foundation. You get a beautiful airbrushed look. All the brushes really pack on the eyeshadow. I would HIGHLY suggest these</li>
    <li> They dont shed&lt;br /&gt;They dont poke&lt;br /&gt;They are soft&lt;br /&gt;They are worth the money!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy them...they are woth the money!</li>
    <li> This was a hit for a Christmas gift.  The teen girl who opened this was ecstatic.  I doubt if all of them will ever be used, but the brushes are top quality.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend these! they are such good quality brushes for such a low price! definitely a great deal :)</li>
    <li> I own this set of brushes and I really love them. They are my go to brushes for everyday use, The price point you can&#x27;t beat for all the brushes. You will not be disappointed if you made this purchase.(absolutely no shedding from the brushes-good quality brushes for the price)</li>
    <li> Love this brushes! They are my first set of brushes n they work wonderfull! And received them so fast! Love them</li>
    <li> The brushes are sooo soft.. I love them!!  There was a tiny bit of shedding tho.</li>
    <li> I still havent used every brush in this set! No shedding whatsoever and the case is beautiful, very eelegant yet understated. Months later im still glad i purchased this.</li>
    <li> Previously i had bought a 60$ Sephora brush set and had been using that for a long time and was very happy with it.... until i purchased this set it was amazing quality and has every brush you could possibly need. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my new brushes! They were easy to use,shed free and they weren&#x27;t flimsy. The case smells a little like plastic but it goes away. I&#x27;m even  thinking of getting a second set</li>
    <li> I think they are a great set of brushes but I can&#x27;t bring myself to use them because they shed like CRAZY. The little hairs fall on my face and itch so bad. So I feel like I threw away money.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft feeling when i got them plus they were individually wrapped in the case. I washed them before using them. Barely had any fall out and they next day I used them and they are awesome for the price! I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for a brush set. the case is not the best and strongest thing ever but I can always get another case if i really have too. Shipping was really fast the brushes were suppose to show up on Monday February the 25 but they came early which was great.</li>
    <li> This brush set is unbelievable! I was a little skeptical of the quality because this set was so affordable but the bristles are synthetic which makes them ideal for applying any kind of makeup. As an aspiring makeup artist, I needed a huge variety of different brushes and these are absolutely perfect. Comes in a beautiful case as well :)</li>
    <li> the serdas or by the brushes are dropping, very bad and do not stop to let loose and come off!</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin but this product was horrid! It came and smelled GOD awful with a chemical stench that many you tubers said would go away ... days and then a week later even after an entire weekend of cleaning and spraying ... it was still there making me light headed and sick. ..... the product just looked a mess and cheap and on top of that I attempted to use a few of the brushes anyway and my face broke out! UGH ... such a disappointment ... I&#x27;ll stick to elf and eco tools</li>
    <li> Omg love them, they are great!</li>
    <li> I really like the product, I just wish there were a list of names for the each brush, so I will know which brush to use. But the brush are great</li>
    <li> Son lo que se esperaba de ellas, son excelentes a mi novia le gustaron mucho, muy bonitas y utiles, buen empaque. Vendedor recomendado gracias.</li>
    <li> I purchased my set from Coastal Scents directly, but lone and behold I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for a new brush set. I must admit, they did last me several months but the bristles shed and the tops of my brushes are falling off and I&#x27;ve reached my breaking point! lol. I was constantly picking little hairs off my face after applying my makeup. So annoying! I guess you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m shocked to see how many 5 star reviews it&#x27;s gotten! Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be ordering these again and would not recommend them. I will be dishing out the extra money and purchasing something that will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Love love love my new brushes! Made my application so much easier!</li>
    <li> أنا مرة أخرى لأكثر! انها لا تحصل على أفضل من ذلك. سأفعل، وسوف نكون سعداء لشرائها مرة أخرى.&lt;br /&gt;هل أقول أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة. يا &amp;#34;حسنا أنا لا أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة.</li>
    <li> The hairs fall out immediately upon use on most of the smaller brushes. The larger ones haven&#x27;t so far and I&#x27;ve had them a few weeks now and use daily. Aside from that, they are very soft and apply make up well, but it&#x27;s annoying with all the stray hairs you have to then remove with each application, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this set again.</li>
    <li> They are fantastic brushes and they aren&#x27;t super expensive. Compared to my high end brushes they work just as well if not better. They do have a smell but that is from the pouch, just air out the bag and its good to go. As suggested I washed all the brushes before use and their was some shedding but it was very minimal. Again they are amazing and I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> I loveeeee this set; It&#x27;s pretty cheap for the quality and being my first set I believe it fits all the expectations that I had. The only problem was the big/feathery brush that is in the set; it is pretty much pointless but other than that it&#x27;s really awesome.</li>
    <li> Great set. Loved this product.</li>
    <li> These brushes are the ones I use daily. They haven&#x27;t shed on me and there are so many to choose from. It&#x27;s a great value. They did smell a little funny when I got them. But once you air out the travel roll, the smell goes away.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loved them</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes reasonable price the only problem is, these brushes are not numbered. I got them in less than two weeks and I have been enjoying them.</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived early, came in this black case, and even though they did have a plastic smell at first, the smell went away after being aired out for a couple of days. I&#x27;ve worn and done makeup for over 40 years, and these are very nice brushes. The bristles are soft and pliable. Very little shedding and wash well with gentle soap. I would recommend them to anyone that wants and use&#x27;s makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes I love how it applys the makeup and I the color and wallet that it came in also love how fast it got here Thank You..</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved this gift, great quality</li>
    <li> in general are good, some brushes the strands get rid of the brush, the case is great, I recommend, I like it</li>
    <li> These brushes are exactly what I was looking for but did not want to pay much money for. Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was shipped within the time frame and the brushes were soft. I would order from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Great makeup brush set for price! They did Shed at first but after washing them the shedding stopped. Also the fan brush was kinda funky shaped but after washing it an laying it out to dry, it went right back to normal. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and hold product well.  Havent experienced any shedding nor did they have a bad smell like some other brushes.</li>
    <li> I am soooo happy. Thanks to Amazon prime I got them in 2 days and ahhhhh!!! They&#x27;re so soft and just beautiful!!&lt;br /&gt;They feel great on the skin. I definitely recommend these brushes if you want to spoil yourself and have a smaller budget.</li>
    <li> This brush set is great!! Where the heck are you going to find brushes with this quality for this fantastic price??!! I washed the entire set with NO shedding - not one of these brushes shed.... They are all very soft and the face brushes are very dense - the quality is awesome! I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; set to be honest; I was sceptical on ordering because of the few \\&quot;nay-sayers\\&quot; but come on .... this is an incredible bargain and I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve taken the chance and added this set to my collection.... Go for it - you&#x27;ll be happy you did!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best, they are smooth on your skin and your make up just looks spectular.&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Really like this set. Just the right amount of brushes. They&#x27;re real soft and apply makeup very nice.</li>
    <li> Needed a new set really bad.  Saw this one and its perfect.  Lots of different brushes.  Love the case it came in.  Its perfect</li>
</ol>
