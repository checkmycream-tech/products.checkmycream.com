<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I started using this eye cream with great expectations, but I found that it ran into my eyes and my vision blurred; my eyes stung and were watery all day. I tried using it at night time only, but it still got into my eyes and my eyes would sting the next day. I like the smell so I use it on dry skin spots around my face (away from my eyes).</li>
    <li> makes my eyes feel scratchy, but does keep the skin moisturized well</li>
    <li> keeping my eyes nice and smooth. goes on non-greasy too</li>
    <li> Please keep making the good stuff excelllent quality and smells fantastic just wishedyou would of make it in larger container.</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to put on, lasts a long time, works very nicely. Also purchased the serum and night cream. Wish amazon carried the day cream with SPF. The smell is strong when you first put it on but after a minute or two is gone. This has made my skin a lot smoother. Even my skin care person noticed.</li>
    <li> My eye eczema got really bad a couple weeks ago due to weather changes and I began researching how to treat it. I started using this eye cream 3 days ago and my eyes are less swollen but they are still red/extremely dry, so I have to use an eczema lotion to apply afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern with this product is that it contains RETINYL PALMITATE, which is excreted in breast milk as RETINOL. I should have checked the ingredients before using it but didn&#x27;t so unfortunately I started using the eye cream without knowing it could negatively affect my baby since I am breast feeding. I am discontinuing the use of this eye cream but plan to try Dr Organic&#x27;s Honey Rescue Cream, which is free of retinyl palmitate (retinol).</li>
    <li> Was melted when I got it. So most spilled out all over my clothes. But the little left on the lid, seemed soft I quickly rubbed under my eye</li>
    <li> This eye cream is light weight, gentle and effective.  I have very sensitive skin and this product effectively calms and moisturizes under my eyes.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Second time around with this eye cream. Doing a good job as my day time eye cream now. I think I used it as a night cream first time around and didn&#x27;t love it for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Softens skin.</li>
    <li> So far has met my expectations, will be able to give better info after trying product for 30 days</li>
    <li> Really impressed with this eye cream so far! I have super sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no negative reactions. The formula is creamy, smells nice, and seems to plump up my eye area while I sleep.</li>
    <li> I recommend the Manuka Honey eye cream and face cream be used at night for any person looking for a soothing product for their skin. It definitely calmed an itchy red seasonal allergy around my eyes. The face cream glides on beautifully. I have not tried it under makeup. In the very humid climate I live in, it may be too sticky for daytime.  I think it would be perfect in a dryer climate though, because the cream gives a moistness to the skin.</li>
    <li> very silky; highly recommend</li>
    <li> I really like this line of products. I ordered the eye cream and facial moisturiser. I purchased other Wild Ferns products in New Zealand and was thrilled to find a provider in the US. The package arrived early. I will definitely order from them again and try more of the Manuka Honey products.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye cr&amp;egrave;mes and decided to try this after a trip to NZ convinced me that they definitely have a handle on skin care products! I find it greaseless and a pleasure to use. It seems to do what I want it to and I recommend it for the sensitive areas around the eyes.</li>
    <li> at first, my mom thought it helped her a bit for the first couple of dyas but after that, she said he eyes looked puffier than ever and she felt a bit irritated.  Maybe she was allergic to the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been using eye cream for twenty years.  At first it was to combat eczema.  Now it&#x27;s that plus other...ahem...aging issues.  I am not brand loyal until now.  Love love love this eye cream.  Not a trace of eczema and my lines seem softened.  It smells like heaven too. Just bought it for the second time.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is soft, silky and hydrating. I have seen a noticeable improvement in just 2 weeks! My dark circles have lightened and my fine lines are minimized. I use it day and night. You only need a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> The eye cream has a soft, clean, honey scent. Not overpowering. It spreads well, with little resistance. Some eye creams I have used in the past have been very thick and hard to spread, but this eye cream is perfect. I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks now and have noticed some improvement in the fine lines around my eyes (laugh lines). I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream.Smooths out fine lines and under eye area feels so smooth.will definitely buy again and will try whole wild ferns line</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old and have very dry skin under my eyes which is prone to lining. It has gotten particularly bad this past winter. This cream is mildly helpful but I have not seen a major improvement in the hydration under my eyes. It&#x27;s better than nothing but its not great.</li>
    <li> This is my new holy grail for eye creams! It&#x27;s rich and creamy but not greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I love that it has a very light, pleasant honey-like scent. It moisturizes and protects and does what is expected and the ingredients are natural and healthy.</li>
    <li> The most important thing: DOES NOT MAKE YOUR EYES STING!!! This is such a good product . Very moisturizing and really does the job. Has a very pleasing scent. I love it and will be buying another jar when this one is gone.</li>
    <li> This product was left at the leasing office, I&#x27;ll be using it tonight, can&#x27;t wait to see how great it is. Sorry about the prior review.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this eye cream. I have very sensitive skin and many creams either irritate or make my skin break out. This cream is very calming and I use it both under my eyes and on my above my lips and in my &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines. I have tried drug store brands my skin definitely responds better to this natural option.</li>
    <li> light and comfortable in texture. love the texture of it. I am not sure how effective it is b/c I had return it. its other products were too heavy in perfume (I bought night revival cream and the hand cream)</li>
    <li> Great product use it not only around my eyes, but also around my lip line, works great.  Use all three products daily, the night cream, the eye cream, and the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Bought this stuff when I was in New Zealand. Last a long time. Very creamy and moisturizing. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Since buying manuka products at the airport in auckland, I have been using them exclusively. This eye cream smells delicious, lasts forever, and also works on my tiny upper lip lines. Absolutely no eye irritation. Koru Naturals&lt;br /&gt;ships super fast.</li>
    <li> Soaks in, smells good, feels good. You don&#x27;t need to use much of it with each application. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I must say this product from New Zealand is dynamic! It&#x27;s a very tiny container for the price, but what it gives you is like a luxury product. I feel it&#x27;s worth the money spent. I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of days but already I feel like my wrinkles in the eye area are reduced somewhat. I&#x27;m very excited to see how they appear after a month of use! It&#x27;s not greasy at all and a little seems to go a long way. I&#x27;m glad I bought this product!</li>
    <li> I have been having problems with the skin under my eyes as well as my eyelids for quite a while now.  It&#x27;s been dry and flaky, itchy, and sometimes even raw feeling.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different eye creams and most of them actually seemed to make my skin feel worse.  I read about this brand in an Amazon discussion and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I used it once and I already love it.  After one use, my skin looks and feels better.  The only gripe I have is that it made my makeup a bit flaky - although I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s not meant to be used under makeup.  I will definitely post an update after using this cream for a few weeks, but so far it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I FOUND THIS EYE CREAM TO BE CREAMY AND HYDRATING, it also smells sweet and feels nice around eyes and mine are sensitive.</li>
    <li> At 55, my skin tends to be oily in places, and although I have had department store \\&quot;skin experts\\&quot; try to convince me that eyelids have no oil glands, my experience and condition have taught me otherwise. It has just been the last year or so that I have noticed changes around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got turned on to manuka honey at a spa, and have tried a few other Wildfern products and loved them, so I tried this one. I am very pleased as it is not at all greasy and heavy feeling like other eye creams I have tried, yet it has eliminated the dryness I have had. It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes or make my eye makeup disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with all these products, as well as the service from Koru. Good products, good people.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and smooth but was not the miracle cure for my dry/itching/sensitive eyes. It irritates them.  If I didn&#x27;t have eye issues, it would probably be soothing, but that&#x27;s the reason I purchased the product, so this is an FYI to those with similar issues.</li>
    <li> AMAZING, I have combo-oily skin including eyelids, after trying so many eye creams from cheap to HIGH end creams this is my Favorite eye cream, a LITTLE does go a long way it hydrates the eye area without leaving it oily or sticky and moisture lasts throughout day.  I will be re purchasing for myself and to gift. Shipping was fast and the packaging was really nice.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I read other reviews on using this Manuka honey eye cream, so I decided to try it.  After months of spending money on products that did absolutely nothing for my eye eczema - I found a winner!  Now after using this 2-3 times per day for 4 weeks, it&#x27;s 90% better. At night I double up with some castor oil on top of the cream for good measure.  Haven&#x27;t rubbed my eyes since.  Such a great find, I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is really one of the best for the price and I have bought alot and spent alot more money. I use this with manuka honey nite cream and it is wonderful. I am very happy with the results already.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an eye cream for some time.  I have been through the high end creams offered by the major cosmetics companys.  The ingredients in those always made my eyes burn and water.  I took a chance and ordered this, as I am not getting any younger :-)  I am in love with this cream, and all of the Wild Ferns products I just purchased.  The skin around my eyes is hydrated and the puffiness (though more lack of sleep related than anything) is gone as are the dark circles.  I have been using it nightly now for just over a week and am very impressed.  Wild Ferns is my new nightime routine.</li>
    <li> My eyes and I thank you....this is really a wonderful eye cream.</li>
    <li> This Cream is really soothing and feels amazing. The winter dryness can be really tough on skin, but this cream moisturizes and prevents the flaking. My husband has very sensitive skin and he loves this for around his eyes. I find that it soaks in very well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. The container is small, but since you don&#x27;t need much it lasts a long time.  In my opinion it has a slight honey scent, but not too strong. I plan on ordering this again and again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would like to use it as a whole face moisturizer but don&#x27;t want to keep running out! This is definitely my favorite eye cream!</li>
    <li> I use this product for my eyes every single day, I have no fine lines, moisturize with out being too grease.</li>
    <li> Again, it feels nice on the skin under my eyes, it is soothing but I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in that area of my face so I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Manuka Honey eye cream for a few years now and simply love this product.  I put it on after washing my face every day and I am 37 years old and have no crows feet.  It also works great as a touch up - put some on a cotton swab and use it to remove any eye make up that smudged into the wrong spot.  Smooth out eyeliner easily and remove mascara from where it doesn&#x27;t belong.  I am able to use it under make up too, you just have to let it soak in first.  It helps diminish those creases you get from powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive skin and goes on smooth (so as not to tear the delicate skin around the eyes).  It&#x27;s lightly creamy and soaks in without a greasy residue.  One container lasts me several months with daily use as a tiny dab goes a long way.  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried hundreds of skin care products over the decades and was so happy to finally find an eye cream worth buying again.  All of the Wild Ferns products I&#x27;ve tried have been exceptional.  This is one of the only products I have left in my daily routine that isn&#x27;t homemade with essential oils because I have yet to master anything that even comes close to what this product does.</li>
    <li> I have blepharitis and when I use this it really helps a lot.  Manuka is miraculous honey, it worked way better than I could have imagined.  I recommend it for anyone suffering with eyelid issues.</li>
    <li> Had to return this cream.  Caused an awful irritation.  Not for sensitive skin.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> rich cream that pairs well with facial night cream</li>
    <li> Any product containing manuka honey will be beneficial. The cream is nice but I found the smell to be a bit overwhelming. On the other hand, my daughter loved the cream and claimed it for herself!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best eye cream I have tried. The texture is creamy with honey odor and the price for its value is unbeatable. I just ordered my third one right now. It is a product I recommend for everyone. I also put it on my face which help with my irritation as well. Great product!!</li>
    <li> No really, it does absolutely nothing for your skin. Texture is ok, seems a little too light to have even a moisturizing effect. No issues with shipping or packaging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years and years, but this is far superior. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of moisture for my normal to dry, 42 year young :), skin. I bought this with the night cream and day cream. (I don&#x27;t like to mix moisturizing products.) The eye cream is light, but rich at the same time. A little goes a long way. I appreciate that the ingredients list is short and understandable. I feel like in my 40&#x27;s I&#x27;m preventing any increase in dark circles and fine lines; if this product continues to work the way it does for me right now, I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Wild Ferns is great and sells a wonderful product. This is thick and creamy and adds a lot of moisture while keeping lines away.</li>
    <li> Fantastic I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of the medicinal properties of Manuka honey. The skin around my eyes has become smoother and less dry. The circles appear to be less pronounced. I have used this product about six weeks and I am please with and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> irritated skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews, I wanted to try this.  I have eczema on my eyelid and it&#x27;s always dry, swollen, sore,  and flaky.  I knew this wouldn&#x27;t cure it, but I hoped it would ease some of the dryness, but no such luck.  I have been to 4 doctors, but nothing seems to help clear it up nor are they sure what is causing it.  I have to say, I really like how my other eye  feels, this product does leave it softer and smoother, so I do think it&#x27;s a wonderful product.  I read about the properties of manuka honey and hoped for a miracle!</li>
