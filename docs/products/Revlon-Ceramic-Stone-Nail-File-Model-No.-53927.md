      <li>Much better than emery board or the metal ones.</li>
      <li>and I love the way it doesn&#x27;t make my nails split and peel like others.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use though.  </li>
      <li>I love how easy they are to clean versus having to buy disposable for each client</li>

      <li>They fit well in my ultrasonic cleaner and clients</li>

      <li>Very durable and safe to use.</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite nail file.  </li>
      <li>- I really have strong nails but prefer a more softer nail file that lets me control how much I want to file and</li>
      <li>/&gt; 4 stars because it breaks easily, and costs too much.</li>
      <li>seem to appreciate the less abrasive but still very effective file.  </li>

      <li>And, the price is right.  </li>

      <li>This purchase was for my daughter &amp; she loves it as much as I do!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>not what i wanted really, but its an excellent file to remove sharp fragments from my awesomely sharp nail clipper</li>
      <li>My wife really likes these files.  </li>
      <li>Much smoother result.</li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>as a massage therapist I need to have smooth short nails.</li>
      <li>I have been using this particular nail file for quite a while</li>
      <li>The seller went above and beyond in quickly shipping a replacement at no charge.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>It performs like new.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too bad more sellers don&#x27;t provide this kind of service.  </li>
      <li>Always buying more of those big cardboard type files at the local stores because they don&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>I love crystal nail files because they last a long time and are not so gritty like emery boards.</li>
      <li>The only thing I cannot tell is, does it have a rough side and a fine side, or are they both the same.  </li>
      <li>it appears to the same as &amp;#34;Ruby Stone&amp;#34;, seems that it always leaves my nail edges a little rough and have to try and smooth.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this would work for a major filing job, I&#x27;ve been using it to keep my fragile nails at a manageable length, and for that, it works better than crystal files, those old rough emery boards, and the one or two use too expensive papery-cardboard things that are supposed to be rinse-able and reuseable, but actually, aren&#x27;t.  </li>

    <li> I love ceramic nail files. They last forever and don&#x27;t go dull like glass ones and doesn&#x27;t rip up your nails like emery files. Glass ones don&#x27;t work after a  few times of use from my experience. I have been searching for one ever since I had a tweezerman one that I lost :(. I guess those are discontinued, but this one is great. Worth it</li>
    <li> i find it hard to file my short guy nails with this without the side burning my finger tip as I do it because its too fat to get under the nail. not what i wanted really, but its an excellent file to remove sharp fragments from my awesomely sharp nail clipper</li>
    <li> I got this hoping it would be like the glass/crystal ones. Not so much. I&#x27;m back with the sephora brand of glass file. Much smoother result.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom. She raves about it. Stays sharp. Good quality. Ordering her a second. Much better than emery board or the metal ones. Does a great job.</li>
    <li> My husband had been given one of these files around a year ago and our daughter broke it using it as a knife to open a package, the moral is a file is a file not a knife. Anyway all I&#x27;ve heard about is how he missed his file and I tried him with other files but they never made him happy. So when I found this file it made my life happier, though I&#x27;m sure he will find something else to whine about before the day is over.</li>
    <li> I broke my old stone nail file (dropped it on a tile floor) and had quite a time finding a good replacement.  This Revlon file is great -- it fits in my purse and never snags my nails when I use it.  I bought one for all the women in my life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nail file like this for years.  I had one for about 25 years and accidentally broke it.  The only problem I have with the transaction is that the postage was so high(over $5.00).</li>
    <li> it appears to the same as &amp;#34;Ruby Stone&amp;#34;, seems that it always leaves my nail edges a little rough and have to try and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this particular nail file for quite a while and I love the way it doesn&#x27;t make my nails split and peel like others.  I would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Kind of crappy. Sorry I bought 2.</li>
    <li> had it only a short while before the stone file fell out of the holder, technically it still files but it&#x27;s much more difficult to hold and use now.</li>
    <li> I have 3 of these &amp; have had them for years - they last forever.  This purchase was for my daughter &amp; she loves it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> Because I have very weak thin nails, I have to use a ceramic nail file. NO stores carry them anymore. I have the same complaint as the others; it falls out of the attachment. It broke quite easily as well. However, with that being said, I do love it, and will continue to buy ceramic files.&lt;br /&gt; 4 stars because it breaks easily, and costs too much.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes these files.  Enough said</li>
    <li> splitting aggravatingly delicate natural nails, like mine.  Very gentle.  No splits, snags, anything that might lead to a bigger nail disaster, like a tear or split.  I don&#x27;t know how this would work for a major filing job, I&#x27;ve been using it to keep my fragile nails at a manageable length, and for that, it works better than crystal files, those old rough emery boards, and the one or two use too expensive papery-cardboard things that are supposed to be rinse-able and reuseable, but actually, aren&#x27;t.  And, the price is right.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best file ever. Just have to take care with file as ceramic is brittle.</li>
    <li> The only thing I cannot tell is, does it have a rough side and a fine side, or are they both the same.  It&#x27;s easy to use though.  The flat surface is wide and your nail does not slip off it.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite nail file.  Loved the free shipping and price too. Nail file also seems to be more gentle than others I have used.</li>
    <li> I like that it leaves my nails smooth. as a massage therapist I need to have smooth short nails. the only down side is that it broke, but I still use it.</li>
    <li> Love these ceramic files and these come with protective covers.  They fit well in my ultrasonic cleaner and clients seem to appreciate the less abrasive but still very effective file.  I love how easy they are to clean versus having to buy disposable for each client</li>
    <li> I love this nail file.  I cannot stand the ones I keep finding at my local drugstore - they rip my nails.  Now I do not have brittle nails - I really have strong nails but prefer a more softer nail file that lets me control how much I want to file and this nail file is awesome.  It files like butter yet gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Nothing works better or lasts longer. Very durable and safe to use. Buy one for your desk, one for your bath and one for your purse or gym bag.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t break. They don&#x27;t wear out like some metal files will, and they don&#x27;t tear at your nails. They work wonders for everything! I even use this on my ferret and she&#x27;s okay with it. Doesn&#x27;t hurt her at all.</li>
    <li> I recently started growing my nails out and have started a nail polish collection. I wanted something reliable to help shape my nails without having to trim them off and this tool does just what I need! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The stone works fine.  After many uses, it can also be washed to remove any embedded debris.  It performs like new. However, one arrived broken.  The seller went above and beyond in quickly shipping a replacement at no charge.  It&#x27;s too bad more sellers don&#x27;t provide this kind of service.  Kudos, and best wishes for continued success.</li>
    <li> Always buying more of those big cardboard type files at the local stores because they don&#x27;t last. This ceramic stone file is very good and I cannot see it wearing out for a long, long time.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love crystal nail files because they last a long time and are not so gritty like emery boards. I do like to push my cuticles back, so the cuticle pusher portion is a neat addition. It&#x27;s plastic and it tapers off at the end for precision. I would buy this again.</li>
