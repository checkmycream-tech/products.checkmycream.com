      <li>I was contacted immediately and they did everything they could to see that I was now satisfied.  </li>

      <li>My boy was very excited to one as well.</li>
      <li>Our 11 year old niece loved this!</li>

      <li>The stencils are easy to remove and reuse with out tearing.</li>
      <li>but the whole family has enjoyed the tattoos!....</li>
      <li>It was a huge hit with everyone.</li>
      <li>It is a fabulous value.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and the tattoo&#x27;s look really cool.</li>
      <li>Everyone will really have a blast!!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and with so many different designs and colors to choose from and its easy to use and be creative.</li>
      <li>None of the tattoos in my set were really child appropriate.</li>
      <li>I forgot to purchase more of the body glue, but will buy more before next play day.</li>
      <li>2nd favorite gift of the holiday season -- after the iPad mini!</li>
      <li>My daughter was fine for 2 days, then said it was really itching.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Secondly, and most importantly, testing before hand for sensitivity might not be enough.  </li>
      <li>First, they can pull hair when taking the stencil off.  </li>
      <li>The &#x27;tattoos&#x27; were so pretty and stayed on for days.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much!</li>
      <li>You can actually spend some quality time with the children and be able to bond closer.</li>
      <li>&#x27;s giving it 4 stars because the stencils are larger and she has more variety of color.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t stay for more than a day or two.  </li>
      <li>and it really works!</li>
      <li>We break it out for a fun treat every once in a while, and both my daughter and my son enjoy showing off their tattoos, which last about 3-4 days before they start to get tattered-looking.</li>
      <li>They are easy to apply and come with enough colors and design choices to please everyone.</li>
      <li>They had so many hours of fun putting these tattoos and the extra set of stencils on legs, arms, back and face.</li>
      <li>Saw e reviews and thought my money was better spent here.</li>
      <li>Will update once it cones off to give an accurate report of how long it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My daughter loves her new tattoo kit!</li>
      <li>but it took a few days to look better.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use the new Holiday tattoos.</li>
      <li>These tattoos are easy to apply but only last 1-2 days before coming off completely.  </li>
      <li>Use a wet one to get the glue off the brush in between applications and it gets everything off right away with no problems and makes it much easier as you go.  </li>
      <li>They go on easily and last a long time.</li>
      <li>Mix the glitter and see your glue art come alive with sparkle!</li>
      <li>It was a hit with these 10 &amp; 11 year old girls!</li>
      <li>and I was super careful taking the stencil off because it was clearly pulling the hair on their arm and</li>
      <li>The customer service I received far out weighs the let down of my original purchase.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money if buying for the under 12 age group.  </li>
      <li>Bought this for my 5 year old who wanted shimmer.  </li>
      <li>From my husband to my 4year old niece.</li>
      <li>and I like that it is hypoallergenic because my kids have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Purchased this tattoo kit for my three grand-daughters, eleven and two eight year old.</li>
      <li>First time I ordered, I got the pink box instead of the blue.</li>

<li> When opened we see skulls, flames and horrible rock rage whatever.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought this for my 5 year old who wanted shimmer.  Saw e reviews and thought my money was better spent here. We had a blast on &amp;#34;beauty day&amp;#34;.  So easy to use stayed on for a ling time, and came off easily in the bathtub.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughters birthday but the whole family has enjoyed the tattoos!....They are easy to apply and come with enough colors and design choices to please everyone.</li>
    <li> What a hit this was for my daughters birthday.  We used every tattoo stencil in this kit and still have plenty of glue and glitter left over.  All the kids and even some of the adults enjoyed this activity.  The glitter tattoos last about 4 to 6 days and then start to come off.  Shipping was fast as usual.</li>
    <li> I purchase 2 of these for m 2 nieces birthdays.  I didn&#x27;t even know that this item was already on their wish list.  It was a hit with these 10 &amp; 11 year old girls!</li>
    <li> We bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party, where I had two teenage girls at a &amp;#34;tattoo station,&amp;#34; giving all the kidlings glitter tattoos using this kit. It not only lasted the entire party (30+ kids and even some adults), with lots of design choices for both the girls and the boys, but there is still tons of glitter left. It is a fabulous value. We break it out for a fun treat every once in a while, and both my daughter and my son enjoy showing off their tattoos, which last about 3-4 days before they start to get tattered-looking.</li>
    <li> These tattoos are easy to apply but only last 1-2 days before coming off completely.  Still much better than buying and having someone else apply.</li>
    <li> We got these tattoos to take on a cruise (so I could avoid paying for hair braiding, etc.) and we had a great time with them. They go on easily and last a long time. We blended colors and made ombre tattoos. Everyone loved them, even my husband.</li>
    <li> Glue was bone dry so couldn&#x27;t use product at all!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  We bought 6 for Christmas gifts and the girls loved them. :). The &#x27;tattoos&#x27; were so pretty and stayed on for days.</li>
    <li> Everyone loved these and they are very easy to apply.  Use a wet one to get the glue off the brush in between applications and it gets everything off right away with no problems and makes it much easier as you go.  I had 2 problems with these.  First, they can pull hair when taking the stencil off.  Lots of girls wanted them on their arms and I was super careful taking the stencil off because it was clearly pulling the hair on their arm and the younger kids were not happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, and most importantly, testing before hand for sensitivity might not be enough.  My sister is middle aged and decided not to test a small area, and got welts immediately after applying one on her ankle and had to remove it with alcohol.  There were 2 other people who started to get itchy a few hours later and upon removing them had swollen areas on their skin.  My daughter was fine for 2 days, then said it was really itching.  I removed it with facial cold cream (oil base will work instead of alcohol on young kids) and after it was removed it was swollen, red, and raw looking.  I put cortisone on it to keep from itching but it took a few days to look better.  BE CAREFUL!</li>
    <li> Purchased this tattoo kit for my three grand-daughters, eleven and two eight year old. They had so many hours of fun putting these tattoos and the extra set of stencils on legs, arms, back and face. I forgot to purchase more of the body glue, but will buy more before next play day.</li>
    <li> I bought this awhile ago and saved for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, yesterday. She&#x27;s been wanting this forever and LOVES IT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s giving it 4 stars because the stencils are larger and she has more variety of color.  She took 1 star away because it doesn&#x27;t last 7-10 days like Shimmer. However, she&#x27;s basing this off the instructions and not a true test. Will update once it cones off to give an accurate report of how long it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s been doing tattoos for hours so....great buy!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. We used it at a public event to give glitter tattoos to all the kids. It was a huge hit with everyone. The glue worked well as did the stencils and the glitter comes in a lovely variety of colors. The order arrived quickly through Amazon from the CA company and I would happily order this again when we run out. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Seemed to be plenty of glitter. Could use a larger size glue.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my niece&#x27;s birthday party and the kids had a great time with the glitter tattoos.  Wonderful purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a kid&#x27;s carnival.  The glitter tattoos were a big hit!  And easy to use!!!  Mix the glitter and see your glue art come alive with sparkle!</li>
    <li> The kids were very excited to get this kit.  It&#x27;s much! bigger then the other kit we bought at the store so this one would last a lot longer.  Colors are beautiful and the tattoo is done in seconds.  Good product!</li>
    <li> The kit was a total let down!  I bought this for a children&#x27;s birthday party.  None of the tattoos in my set were really child appropriate.The box showed great pics of unicorns etc.  When opened we see skulls, flames and horrible rock rage whatever. Do not waste your money if buying for the under 12 age group.  Nothing girly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This company really stands behind their products.  I was contacted immediately and they did everything they could to see that I was now satisfied.  The customer service I received far out weighs the let down of my original purchase.  I will definitely use this company again.  Can&#x27;t wait to use the new Holiday tattoos.</li>
    <li> We have used this for our school&#x27;s fall festival 2 years in a row. They work very well and last a few days. We ran out of glue last year so we ordered extra this year. Very good product!</li>
    <li> Our family had such a wonderful time enjoying the glitter tattoo kit from GlitzGlam!!! It&#x27;s easy to use and with so many different designs and colors to choose from and its easy to use and be creative. You can actually spend some quality time with the children and be able to bond closer. But, again, it&#x27;s so much fun!!! Allow ample time to really enjoy this product!!! Everyone will really have a blast!!! Great for parties or family-get-togethers!!!</li>
    <li> 2nd favorite gift of the holiday season -- after the iPad mini! Our 11 year old niece loved this!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her new tattoo kit! It&#x27;s easy to use, and the tattoo&#x27;s look really cool. My only complaint is that the stencils don&#x27;t really seem reusable.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased for a birthday party. It worked great. Girls loved getting tattoos. Big hit at the party. I am planning to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my 7yr old&#x27;s birthday party. The stencils are easy to remove and reuse with out tearing. There is plenty of glue and glitter to go around.</li>
    <li> There were no reusable stencils in the boxes I received. First time I ordered, I got the pink box instead of the blue. So I sent it back and reordered. Idk why they are advertised as reusable, but that is why I ordered them. They stick on to the skin, and then you peel them off. Cannot be reused.</li>
    <li> I thought that only my girl will like the glitter tattoo but I was wrong. My boy was very excited to one as well. Great for boys and girls and I like that it is hypoallergenic because my kids have sensitive skin. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a family get-together. Kept everyone entertained. From my husband to my 4year old niece. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have enough stencils. I&#x27;m happy to see that you can buy stencils by themselves. I ordered some for the next time we all get together. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> It works great and my grandchild loves it.  The only problem is it doesn&#x27;t stay for more than a day or two.  It makes her happy and that is really what it is all about.</li>
    <li> Perfect and it really works!</li>
