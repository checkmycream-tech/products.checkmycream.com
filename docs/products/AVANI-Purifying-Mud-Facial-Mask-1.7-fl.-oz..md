    <li> The product makes my skin feel dewy after use, and I think that dead sea mud is great for the skin. I do not feel that it did anything amazing for my skin, however, and had much more success with the soap bars from the same line. One big complaint is that the jar dried out after only a few uses, and is pretty much a waste now. I would buy the trial packs instead.</li>
    <li> When I open the jar it was not dried out (like previous reviewed). The mud works for my skin. I also brought the soap. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I received it when it was dry as if it is out of date... I will never buy it again</li>
    <li> this mud goes on way to thin and doesnt do anything, its very thick mud but it goes on super thin, its very hard to even get a thick application. It dries in a minute and then you wash it off, your better off buy the Aztec Healing Clay and Apple Cider Vinegar, that stuff works much better then this and is way cheaper and lasts way longer.</li>
    <li> This was a very small jar. I didnt feel anything before or after using it. Product was not worth the money for the amount let alone feeling like it didnt do anything.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product and received the product, but in less than adequate condition.  The screw-on lid was loose in the packaging and the product was dried out.  Won&#x27;t do this again.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but I&#x27;m still seeing if it will work for what I wanted to use it for.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery, reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My favorite mask!!!!! it cleans pores and rejuvenates skin. Great ingredients and Pleasant scent. Love it!  Will buy again as soon as I am done with this jar!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I wear glasses and have a oily tzone. Tightens pores so they look smaller. I&#x27;ve only used it on my face. Will try body next.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  It has cleared all my blimishes.  I give my 14  year old a facial with these Avani products and his face is flawless.  Qick delivery on this product.</li>

    <li> I do not like this at all did nothing for me I used it for a couple times and make my face dry. Is not easy to apply very messy and soo thick. Before u buy this think about it but for real do not recomend it</li>
    <li> I love this product. I had oily skin and used to break out. It takes all the oil away and if I feel a flare up. I just place some on the area and all better. Wonderful I definately will use over and over again.</li>

    <li> Makes your face feel so smooth!</li>
    <li> Really like the mask!</li>
    <li> I have had this product a few months and I t my tried it.  I loved it, I left it on longer that stated and I felt my face looked very different.  Moisture, pure and smooth, it&#x27;s a keeper for me!!</li>
    <li> This is pure mud, no mixtures to make it easier to spread on.  It is think and pasty. With that said, it definitely does the job of clearing out the grime and soothing your skin.  I used it after the thermal mask and facial peel.</li>
