<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great purchase. I have had this for 2 months and still have not had to replace the cleaning liquid tray yet, although i only shave every 3-4 days. Great razor though, no rashes etc.</li>
    <li> Disappointed by a shaving quality. Only later I discovered this was not the original Braun, it was pulsonic 9000. The major disadvantage, however, the foil design. The replacement cost $40 and the original foil last for about one year. So, this is just one more  &amp;#34;replacement scam&amp;#34; trap.</li>
    <li> Between the cleaning system and the degree to which it gets my face decently smooth, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth your time.</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Works great, even a year after purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have used. Over the past I have used several different rotary shavers and none have come close the shaving as close as this one does. I would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun electric razor. I hope it continues to perform as well as the past razors did.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor thru Amazon after researching electric razor options. My husband wanted to switch from a traditional razor to electric, but having tried one many years ago, he was not impressed and decided to keep using the traditional method. He has now reached a point where he was willing to give an electric razor another try. The directions appear to be somewhat overwhelming for a senior citizen, what with the sterilization of the razor head and how to clean it vs. an older or cheaper model that you just plug in and shave with.  But he has found that this razor holds its charge and once he has tried it a time or two has found it to be pretty easy  to shave with. The razor heads give him a close clean shave and he enjoys the portability of it. He can now take it with when we travel vs making sure he has shave cream and his razor packed. And the cleaning of the razor head has proven to be pretty simple and it thus sanitizes the razor head assuring him that the next time he uses this electric razor it will be clean and sanitized for him.</li>
    <li> works very well-does not clean as well as I would like-so need to use the brush weekly.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver every day as I go to work. It is better then the last one I had and is very good on battery life.</li>
    <li> Best shave by an electric razor.</li>
    <li> What more is there to say?  I have a pretty tough beard and this is doing a great job.  Kind of a pain to pay for the cleaning fluid refills, though.</li>
    <li> This is what I always wanted.  An electric razor that can be used everyday without skin irritation and a very good shave.  Better than other choices.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> For those that don&#x27;t have much facial hair growth, I would still recommend investing in this high end model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have been using lower end Braun shavers for many years, finding it difficult to justify the high price since I don&#x27;t shave so often. But with these low end models if there wasn&#x27;t enough to shave, it would have a tough time getting a clean shave, often leaving pesky hairs behind that are growing at odd angles. So even though I don&#x27;t have such long facial hair I would never really be perfectly clean shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the series 7, the center strip between the 2 foils seems to align the odd angled ones so they can be cut cleanly. Definitely a better shave and worth the money even if you don&#x27;t shave so often.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the people who don&#x27;t like the way this shaver shaves. IT&amp;#34;S FANTASTIC!!!! Close shave, comfortable, the BEST self cleaning system on the market. And I agree with everyone else. the 760 has all the features you need. I&#x27;m coming from an Braun Series 8000 and this is everything that one was and more.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t need to worry about Amazon taking it back, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> This one is the best of all razors yet. Has a long battery life and recharges fast. Great to take on trips.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  It gives a good close shave.  The only thing I&#x27;m not too happy about is the cleaning system, you still have to manually clean the head if you want it clean and not clogged-up.  Still t beats Norelco  and Remington the two previous brands i owned.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my new razor. I read online how to bypass the expensive cleaning solution and plan to clean it that way when the initial cleaning solution is gone.</li>
    <li> My husband had the 300 series for yrs and loved it. Then it broke. Got this one on such a deal I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, and he is so happy.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  It gives a close shave and my beard is very coarse.  Great battery life.  The only drawback is the cleaner well is not very deep and you have to change the solution quite often.</li>
    <li> I switched over from a straight razor where I would get a great shave with a few knicks and cuts. The series 7 gives me the closeness of a razor shave in less than half the time without the cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait at least a few months before I actually went ahead and wrote a review on this wonderful shaver. Let me tell you, it is the best electric shaver I have ever used. I started using electric shavers when I was 14 because the conventional blades would irritate my skin really bad and cause me to breakout. I really didn&#x27;t like the electric shavers because they would pull on my hair or not get all of it. This baby is something else though. It cuts as well if not better than a razor blade. I use it almost everyday and not once have I been disappointed. I really like the clean and renew system too. It keeps the shaver nice and fresh after every use. I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re like me and have sensitive skin. Or just want one of the best  electric shavers out there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s s perfect shaving machine, deliver all that is promised!&lt;br /&gt;The batttery is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend for sure.&lt;br /&gt;Worth each penny.</li>
    <li> Good but I expected better from reading reviews</li>
    <li> My husband was happy with the shaver system. It gives a close shave and works well.</li>
    <li> I get a very smooth shave. Best in app. 50 yrs. of using Braun shavers.</li>
    <li> This is an upgrade from my husbands previous Braun razor which he wore out after many years of use.  Since it was a present I had to read a lot of reviews to figure out which one to get.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the cleaning system just because it means monthly expenses of the cleaning fluid, but it seems the better razors all have them.  One thing I have since noticed is that the razor gives you the choice of doing the cleaning or not.  Just setting the razor in the unit doesn&#x27;t start it up.  The indicator light lets you know how dirty the razor is and then you have to push the button to activate it.  He&#x27;s only used it for 2 weeks so I don&#x27;t know how long the cleaning fluid really does last.  This is one of the quietest razors I have ever heard though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Braun shavers and this one is the best yet! Gives a really close shave and has nice features. Well worth the price. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 7-760 cc works very well for me. I upgraded from a $39 Norelco rotary razor and can see the difference. The series 7 defintely gives a much, much smoother shave for the same amount of time. With the series-7, I can feel my chin as smooth as they make out to be in the ads. The motor is pretty powerful and you can feel it revving; the flat but longer cutter does a better job than the rotary blades (for me). I do need to watch myself in a shaving mirror up-close to weed out all the areas neat and clean. The personalization adjustments - where you can increase or decrease the intensity of the razor - works fine on the sensitive areas of the neck. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any red areas after the shave. I do have to stretch my skin as recommended. The cleaning system is a bit of a drain as I look at it. The cleaning cartridge can last upto 60 days, but you will need to replace it - an on-going expense. You can wash the razor under water and the cleaning indicator still says the razor requires the minimum level of cleaning. I plan not to replace the cartridge and stick to water cleaning, though I have to forgo the nice fresh  lemon smell when I have it up-close for shaving. The razor can run off the electric cord straight which is a big plus for me as I personally don&#x27;t like rechargeable batteries - they are not good for the environment. The corded operation means I have less to carry when I travel. While the one sixty bucks price tag is a bit overboard for me for a razor, my shave with the series-7 definitely leaves me satisfied each and every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver for all of my adult life and was desperately in need of a replacement. I previously had a Remington which admittedly was a low-end model but it had dual foils and cut extremely close to the skin! Didn&#x27;t need to follow up with a straight razor after shaves. So after reading all of the great reviews for the 7 series decided I needed to upgrade and was willing to pay top dollar for Braun&#x27;s top-of-the-line electric shaver. After 2-3 shaves I was very disappointed in the product. It did not shave as close as my previous low-end $30 Remington and each time I had to follow-up with a straight razor to get it down to the skin. I will say that it does cut very well with few passes, just not down to the skin which is what I was used to. I even tried stretching my skin making several passes but in the end it did not achieve the results I expected. For the price I think it should match if not surpass a $30 electric razor.</li>
    <li> First off, electric shaving experiences can differ person to person. For example someone who has been shaving with a razor for a very long time will take differently to electric shavers than one who has not. Hair texture also matters.    That said, I chose the foil over my existing dual-rotor philips because it does not shave a thin layer of skin as well. I tested this by applying after shave post using each shaver type to see how much it stings. The foil types burn far lesser than the rotary kind. So if you want smoother skin post your shave this is the one.    However, the Braun Series 7 also has in the middle of the two foil (domes) a splicer. The splicer does take some skin off and you notice that in the neck area where you might have put some more effort shaving. (the hard to reach areas implying more effort shaving were also the areas that stung more with the after shave)    The Series 7 offers a good close shave and gets several days of stubble off without any extra effort. The on board trimmer is very useful for a trim and to get the stubborn few strands left. The neck area takes longest otherwise you can a have a quick shave.     Where earlier the foil-only shavers were inept, this one with the combination of foil, splicers and a trimmer makes for the best foil shaver around.    Negatives - This is a loud shaver. Unlike my rotary shaver this one does not take all the cut hair inside, it does splay around, you need to shave in front of a sink. Unless its daily, where the tiny cut hairs go inside.    The Cleaner. I tried to figure out how on what basis it determines when it needs a clean. From my understanding unless it has some very advanced current state sensors the simplest way is to have a counter of how many times the shaver is switched on and off and to set cleaning levels from there. (please correct me, i am only speculating)    My experience for the above is after two full shaves and a small trim the cleaning station demanded a maximum clean. I must have switched it on and off several times during this time.     The cleaning process is noisy, as the shaver switches on and off (which by itself is loud). It also consumes quite a bit of time.    You can clean it manually, which is what you would do most of the time. I don&#x27;t see great use of the cleaning function aside the fact that I think it disinfects and smells quite ok.    Battery lasts a long time, judging from current use. I haven&#x27;t run it to dry yet as I returned it to station for cleaning a few times so it charges by default.    I would suggest get the cheapest of the 7 series models, or if you want the cleaning option get this one here. They all fundamentally work the same except for cleaning functions and some features. It does offer a close shave and is good to the skin.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used almost ever brand that&#x27;s been on the market for the last 40 years. I recommend this shaver without reservation or equivocation. CGDIII, Houston, TX</li>
    <li> i think it is perfect</li>
    <li> This is a piece of crap. Its hard to set up and the instruction manual leaves a lot to be desired. I should have stayed with Norelco.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun Syncro 7526 and am very happy with the shave.  The battery was starting to die after years of use, so I decided to buy a new Braun.  What a mistake.  Worst shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  It simply doesn&#x27;t cut hair.  My face was numb from pressing so hard to try to get all the hairs it missed.  The sideburn clipper is poorly designed also.  It looks like it could break off very easily.  Also, blade is razor is curved instead of straight.  What a ridiculous design.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving system I have ever seen. Easy to use yet very efficient shaving the more difficult areas. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for many years. Like their enclosure stated, may take 2 to 3 weeks for beard to get used to, after that, comfortable, close shave.</li>
    <li> This product is over prices.  First time my husband used it, he got a HORRIBLE rash!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor system I have experienced to date. I have owned all of the brands over the years and research them extensively, tests when possible. Generally, I feel the technology changes enough that I will purchase a newer model every 4-5 years to take advantage of the improvements. Although all brands continue to improve the Braun has consistently been the best for my face and beard.</li>
    <li> The shaver works great! The refill liquid is pretty expensive and doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> I shaved with a blade from the age of 15 to 72, when I had surgery on my \\&quot;shaving hand.\\&quot;  I couldn&#x27;t hold the razor so I bought this electric shaver.  It gets an acceptably close shave in 5 or 6 minutes and although it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a blade, for quick shaves or just for a change, it is well worth the money.  A wonderful part of this shaver is that you simply press a button and it cleans itself.  The cleaning liquid lasted about 6 months and might have lasted longer except I decided to err on the safe side and changed it.  Well worth the money if you are tired of blade-shaving or you want a quick shave or are at a place when you can&#x27;t use a blade.</li>
    <li> Best razor I ever had! Close shave and excellent cleaning method.</li>
    <li> Performed as expected with a fast close shave.  Not thrilled with the users manual in that it was a bit awkward and had to be read more than once.  I would add a short, bullet point card with the steps to follow (some of us need occasional reminders on what each of these features mean).</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun electric shaver I have owned.  The features are wonderful.  My only criticism about this line of porducts is that, in the past, they wore out within three years.  I am hoping I get a longer life out of this version.</li>
    <li> I bought a Braun Series 7-760 in November 2010 and when I started to shave with it I was alarmed by the fact that when it cut the whiskers from my face, the cuttings would fall out and litter the sink that I shave over. I thought \\&quot;Well, this isn&#x27;t right\\&quot; and contacted Braun about it. They assured me that this was not supposed to happen and advised me to send it to be repaired. Well, I called the two service centers in Mass. and neither one of them had ever heard of such a problem so I took advantage of the money-back guarantee and returned the shaver to Braun&#x27;s returns processing center. I purchased another shaver, same model and the SAME thing happens. I thought maybe I hadn&#x27;t set the head on the shaver correctly or something. At one point I shaved a 4-day accumulation of growth from my face and the cuttings were falling all over my hand -- felt like bugs were flying into me! Very strange. So I contacted Braun again and they asked that I please send it to a service center, which I did. I then heard back from the service center that because this shaver is not a \\&quot;closed unit,\\&quot; the clippings will indeed fall out. Apparently, the design that allows for the cleaning fluid to flow through the unit also allows the cut hair to fall out during shaving. Not sure why no other review I have read mentions this. I find this to be very aggravating -- you have to clean up all the clippings after every shave! After complaining to Braun once again they emailed me that a \\&quot;small amount\\&quot; of clippings falling out of the shaver during each shave is not unusual.     All that being said, the shaver is lighter than it looks and it does provide a very close/comfortable shave. My big complaint is that it&#x27;s so messy to use. Also, the cleaning fluid can get expensive to use when you figure out the cost for a few years. Also, I put the unit through the cleaning cycle and it was VERY loud -- I thought I had put the shaver in the base incorrectly -- it sounded like someone was cutting metal with an electric saw in my house!    For the money this unit costs, you should be able to get a close shave without having to deal with cuttings all over the sink and countertop, but I will repeat that the shave is very close.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, the 2nd one I have owned, this one is even better than the first one that lasted for 7 years and less expensive too. I&#x27;mm very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The 760cc electric razor is a significant improvement from the 8500 series razor in many ways.  It is lighter, quieter shaving, quieter cleaning, and gives a much better shave than the earlier model.  If you are not sure whether or not to replace the older razor because it&#x27;s still working, I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his shaver.  It prevents ingrown hairs and works very well.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous electric razors, and this is definitely my favorite. I switched from rotarys and could not have been more pleased. While substantially louder (Oral-B electric tooth brush vs. Sonicare) I feel it is much gentler on my face. The cleaning/lubricating base is definitely worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Received this razor after my 3 series was finally giving out.  WOW what a huge difference.  This is one heck of a product!</li>
    <li> When I was a poor college student, I could only afford the low-end electric razors.  I got what I paid for: missed whiskers, shave was not close so I had to shave more often...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated to purchase a Braun shaver because they were so expensive.  But when I saw the price come down to $150 (almost 40% off the MSRP), I just had to try it.  Braun provides a 60-day money back guarentee (it used to be 90-days).  I chose the 760cc over the [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 790cc]] because the only difference was the \\&quot;quick clean\\&quot; feature, which, quite frankly, isn&#x27;t needed unless multiple people are using one razor.  And even then, cleaning only takes about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I am used to using an electric razor, there was an adjustment period.  The Braun gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  If you&#x27;re not used to this, you will be surprised.  You will have to use some sort of aftershave because of this; otherwise, your skin will be irritated all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing about this razor is the proprietary cleaning system.  The instructions show you how to clean the razor with just water (for use while travelling).  But using the cleaning system at least once a month will make sure that the razor gets the lubrication it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase and glad the price came down to make it affordable.  Not sure if I&#x27;d still buy it now that the price is back to over $200.</li>
    <li> Best shaving machine  ever!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun 760 for about a month now. I replaced an older Series 5 which I had for several years and was happy with.  It was due for a replacement blade and foil so I decided to upgrade to the 760 and the price seemed reasonable on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve used Brauns for most of my shaving life and been satisfied. The 760 was a bit more money than the old Series 5 I had and includes the Clean and Renew system which I had never used before - more on that later.    The 760 is a truly impressive shaver. It is a noticably faster and closer shave while being more comfortable than my old one. The 760 offers two main advances over my older Series 5 which make a big difference. The main advance is the integrated blade and foil cassette rather than the older separate cutting block and foil arrangement. The integrated cassette provides a very smooth and close shave. All the marketing buzz words like triple action, pulsonic, and optifoil really do add up to an effective shaving system. The foils move separately in multiple dimensions to closely track your face&#x27;s bumps, nooks, and crannies. The integrated blade allows it to closely track the foils without burning. The shaver is also much quieter than my old one. While I thought the personalization mode was a gimmick,I have been using it on more sensitive spots on my face. Basically, it is a button which slows the shaver down, but it is effective. The other major advance is the abiltiy to rinse the shaver in water. This is important for travel. I never have to use the brush now. A rinse is quick and very effective.    I was fully prepared to dislike the Clean and Renew system as a gimmick to sell the cleaning cartridges. However, I have been very impressed with it. Simple to use and it is very thorough with the shaver coming out looking like new. No goo or films on it. I don&#x27;t use it every day and am on my second month of the first cartridge using it every few days. It is a bit noisy when it goes through the cycles, but overall seems a very good system. Looks like I&#x27;ll get two months out of a cartridge, which makes it more cost effective. I was buying cleaning sprays and fluids for my old shaver and that was a lot more work. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I get roped into using it more often because it is so convenient. It&#x27;s a bit bulky, but I keep it in a vanity drawer when I&#x27;m not using it. Rinsing is quick and very effective, but the clean and renew saves those few seconds in the morning for me and provides lubrication for the cutting system.    Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the Braun 760. Looks to be a good value to get get the clean and renew system compared to the 720, which doesn&#x27;t have the clean and renew, and the 790 which looks to be almost identical for a lot more money in a fancier color - no one watches me shave. the Braun 760 wasn&#x27;t cheap, but hey, it&#x27;s my face and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. If you are an electric shaver guy, I can&#x27;t imagine going wrong with this shaver.    Also, my son has the Series 3 without the clean and renew, and it doesn&#x27;t have the swivel head of the 7 series, but shares the same integrated cassette block technology and rinsability - great value for a younger shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 20 years and I&#x27;ve tried everything from cheap electrics (terrible idea, but I was just a kid) to mach 3 turbo razors (best non-electric for me btw) to expensive Norelco and Remington models.  After shaving with the Braun Series 7 (only the series 7, the lesser series are not in the same league), I will never shave with anything else if I have my choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is 2 important things to me.  First, I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, so I need a close shave in the morning or else I&#x27;ll have to shave again at lunch time.  This shaver takes care of that problem where other brands I&#x27;ve tried just don&#x27;t get close enough.  Second, I have sensitive skin, especially when shaving the neck.  Anybody who has shaved before a workout knows the burn when the sweat hits your fresh shave.  For any guy who is sick of having little red spots all over your face and neck from the irritation (attention Mach 3 users), this is the shaver for you.  It&#x27;s so smooth that I don&#x27;t even use after shave and I haven&#x27;t for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cleaning function is just a bonus in my opinion.  There&#x27;s something great about feeling like your shaver is clean like it was brand new every morning.</li>
    <li> Before you buy a gadget this complicated you should consider if it will really work and whether the manufacturer will stand behind it when it fails. This works fine as an ordinary razor. But the motivation for paying so much money is the automatic cleaning system. Well, I have news for you--that part is a piece of poorly conceived, poorly engineered, and poorly executed junk. The problem is not merely that the autocleaning function does not properly clear itself of cut hair, but also that the system itself will simply die on you unexpectedly. In my case after about 4 months of use. Of course the razor still works if you plug it in directly to charge the battery, but the loss of the maintenance system is a severe hit to utility.    Worse, when you go to get the thing fixed you find there is no practical or convenient place to go. Braun does not maintain company supported service centers in the US and rather depends on a disorganized set of randomly and poorly accessible private vendors. For example, no one services Braun shaver products in DC or MD. The only servicers are private companies in Wilmington and Virginia Beach. So the only way to get this fixed is to deal with someone 3 hours away who isn&#x27;t even a Braun specialist. The company itself provides NO SUPPORT to its customers. This is a BIG FAIL.</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun 3 series shaver for almost 2 years.  The trimmer broke during travel and the cleaning system was no longer usable afterwards.      I loved the 3 series.  However, I read the reviews of the 7 series.      The 7 series does cost more...  BUT IT IS WORTH IT!    I shave all of my head with an electric razor.  Face, neck, head...all of it.    This razor glides through my hair like the 3 series never did.  And my girlfriend swears I am using a blade in regard to how smooth my face is.    If you can afford this razor...  You will not be disappointed.  It is the best purchase I have made in some time.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. I had a cheaper twin foil razor for 12 years and finally upgraded to the Braun series 7. It is a dream come true. Worth every dime. Highly recommend this razor if it lasts. Time will tell</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because of the reviews on consumer search sites and even here at Amazon but I must say I am thoroughly disappointed in this razor. And here&#x27;s the kicker, IT CAN&#x27;T BE RETURNED! I research a lot before I buy something this expensive and I have to say I didn&#x27;t find anything overwhelming negative about this item so I decided to go for it. Big mistake. It looks and feels nice, but I own an old Norelco Spectra 8845XL who&#x27;s battery died on me forcing me to buy a new razor but the Norelco&#x27;s shave was MUCH closer. When I get done shaving with the Braun 760cc I look like I already have my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow coming in. It doesn&#x27;t matter how hard I try I cannot get a close shave with this razor. Very disappointing. What I plan to do now is use it as a $200 paperweight (the case it comes with is very attractive) and buy a replacement NiCd battery for my Norelco that I will have to solder in myself. Could have saved myself 190 dollars if someone had posted a review like this before I bought this. Its better than shaving with a sharpened stone. Thats the only positive thing I can think to say.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever had Remington razors in the past and tried this Braun based on a recommendation.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver for nearly a month now and absolutely love it.  It does a great job on my head, face, and neck.  Shaver works well on face for daily use and every other day use on head.  Self cleaning is great and keeps the shaver running efficiently.  Battery holds its charge for many days so I haven&#x27;t had issues traveling with this either.  Definitely buy this razor!</li>
    <li> I will preface this review by stating that the only razor I have never purchased is a Panasonic.  In addition, I have never bought a razor this expensive.  That being said, this razor gave me a very close shave.  I agree with many of the reviews that this is probably the closest electric razor shave that I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  It is almost as good as a straight razor blade and a lot easier and convenient.  It is easier to hold and much easier to clean.  It is quieter than the other razors. I also like the new cleaning apparatus which is better than the old one which I&#x27;ve had for many years now.  The brush is smaller but adequate.  The case only handles the razor and the brush. Unfortunately, it is unable to hold the cord but that seems to be the case now with most of the razors and devices</li>
    <li> Most of the reviews talk about how great this shaver is.  I found it to just be okay.  It does the job, but not as smoothly and quickly as described.  This is my first foil razor in years.  My biggest complaint is how messy it is.  It throws the shaved hair all over the counter and sink.  My last razor would catch the hair and keep the counter clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this razor is ok, but not to sure Id recommend.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use and maintain.  Wish I had never ordered it!  Should have returned it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I should reviewed this product in greater depth befoe ordering.</li>
    <li> I have to say after 30 years of blade shaving I finally had to change to an electric razor. This is as close to a blade shave as I can get without having to worry about nicks and cuts. I tried an electric razor many years ago and it didn&#x27;t compare to this. I love this razor and would recommend it to anyone.     I tried the 340 wet/dry razor but it didn&#x27;t seem to have the power I needed so I upgraded a couple weeks later to this and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to slow down.     Nice clean shave and the cleaning system makes it so easy to clean and charge. I&#x27;ll never go back to a blade again.</li>
    <li> This shaver was above my expectations! After only about a week I was used to it and it is far better that rotary shavers. It gets a much closer shave and the cleaning system is another plus. I am extremly satisfied and happy.[[ASIN:B003YJAZZE Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver]]</li>
    <li> I have had the benefit of owning the Braun 3-390cc, 3-370, and now the 7-760cc...all in the last 4 months.  Before this I owned the 8585 Activator, and before that the 6520 Flex Integral.  Before that I forget, but I have been shaving with Braun shavers for about 20 years.  They rarely go bad...I just get enticed to buy the latest technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 3-390cc about 4 months ago.  Before I even had a chance to give it a proper review, TSA lost my shaving kit while inspecting my baggage, and so my shaver was gone.  This shaver lacked power.  If I skipped a day of shaving, it really bogged down on two days worth of stubble.  I felt like I had to have my face 5 times to get everything.  And the cleaning system was very rudimentary.  If you dropped the shaver into the cleaning system and pressed the button to latch it in there, it cleaned the shaver automatically, whether it was dirty or not.  Even if you just cleaned it a few hours ago.  No \\&quot;sensing technology\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t believe the 3-390cc cleaner had a heated dry either because it would still be wet with the alcohol solution 6-8 hours later.  Also, after only 3 months there was a build up of scum in the cleaner where the shaver sits.  I opened up the shaver&#x27;s blade cartridge a couple of times and it still had a few whiskers in there.  I probably would have rated it 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since TSA lost my 3-390 shaver, but I still had the cleaning system at home, I bought a standalone 3-370 with no cleaning system.  I found out quickly it didn&#x27;t work with the cleaning system from the 3-390cc.  I inquired with Braun (P&amp;G) and they said it should, but it didn&#x27;t, so I sent it back.  The 3-370 shaves exactly like the 3-390.  I think it has one less LED indicator, and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided this was a sign that I needed to look higher up in the Braun shaving lineup.  I&#x27;m amazed I even found this shaver because Amazon&#x27;s search engine is so quirky and doesn&#x27;t provide this shaver as an option in the Braun Store.  This is by far the best looking Braun shaver I have ever seen, and may be the best overall shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7-760 is MUCH more powerful than the 3 Series shavers.  I shaved two days worth of stubble today like a hot knife goes through butter.  This shaver has easily cut my shaving time in half.  It does a much better job with neck hair that lays flat and is hard to get.  The Pulsonic technology vibrates and almost gives you a face massage while you&#x27;re shaving.  Braun recommends that you set the Pulsonic strength level to high for the best shave,and they are right.  I&#x27;ve noticed that this shaver allows me to get closer to my chin beard without pulling any of the whiskers out (ouch!).  It has a much more precise feel to it.  The pop out trimmer is a little unusual, but I have gotten used to it already and it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7-760 cleaning system is much better too.  It senses the level of cleaning needed and reports what level cleaning it intends to do via an indicator light, but waits until you actually push a \\&quot;GO\\&quot; button.  I really like this new feature because my 8585 had this sensing technology, but proceeded with cleaning as soon as you dropped the shaver into the cleaning system.  The 7-760 cleaner is built much more like the cleaner from the 8585 Activator, and I think it does a better job than the new style of cleaner that comes with the 3 Series.  No scum is accumulating in the cleaner, and not a single whisker is left in the shaver after it is done with a light cleaning.  If you clean the shaver ever day it appears that it never has to do a deep cleaning, because I haven&#x27;t seen one yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun is skimping on the case and brush these days.  The case is the same for the 3-370, 3-390 &amp; 7-760.  The 7-760 gets a little bit bigger brush, but that&#x27;s it.  No room in the case to take along the power cord.  The cleaning systems for each model use the exact same Clean &amp; Renew refills, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I recommend this shaver.  If you&#x27;ve tried a cheaper Braun and aren&#x27;t happy, take them up on their 60-day money back offer and get this one.  I think you&#x27;ll see a big difference.  I wish the 7-760cc didn&#x27;t cost me $220, but it appears I&#x27;m an early adopter, so maybe the price will come down.cheaper Braun and aren&#x27;t happy, take them up on their 60-day money back offer and get this one.

    <li> A replacement for a similar product that wore out after 3 years.  I still like it but think it should be more durable.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a 8-9 year old fairly basic Braun cordless shaver.  I find the 7-760cc to provide outstanding performance.  I get a consistently close, clean shave.  The beard trimmer leaves a bit to be desired but is sufficiently effective to keep my eyebrows trim and shave my neck hair.  The charge extends for about a week.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I was tired of shaving with a razor so I decided to make the change to an electric shaver. I guess my beard is still getting used to it, but it still leaves my face feeling as smooth as it did with my razors. The cleaning system is interesting, but can be a little noisy, so just leave it in the bathroom an close the door. There is also a little trimmer on it as well that works great too.</li>
    <li> Great shaver &amp; the transaction over Amazon worked perfect. On top of this the product was delivered within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I just upgraded to this product from the 8985 series Braun razor. The charging base went bad after more than 10 years of use with great results. Now, I&#x27;ve used this newer model and I&#x27;m very pleased so far. I highly recommend Braun products!</li>
    <li> I liked the shave of this one much better than the previous Braun 5 series model that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wasn&#x27;t so nuts about is that the 760 lasted just barely more than 2 years (the warranty period); my 5 series model lasted 7 years.  Considering that Braun is getting ongoing revenue from the cleaning solution and replacement razor/foil, they need to significantly improve the life of the product.  I&#x27;m giving Braun the benefit of the doubt and getting a replacement (the 790 is just $1 more than the 760 at the time of writing), but if the quality isn&#x27;t there over the long haul, I&#x27;ll have to consider other brands in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to razors and shaving cream. When I was looking to migrate to an electric shaver, all of the reviews I read always said the same thing: \\&quot;Not as close as a razor, but good for an electric shaver, blah blah...\\&quot;. However, my first shave with the Braun 7-760 was as close to the skin as a gillette mach5 minus the razor burn. Hopefully this review will help if you aren&#x27;t used to an electric shaver and were looking to compare results.</li>
    <li> For my profession, I need to have a pretty close shave. The Braun 760cc definitely gets its job done. Nothing shaves as close as this does except for shaving with a normal Gillette shaver against the grain. This also shaves time off of hygiene in the morning since you can use it as a dry shaver, so no need to lather up with some shaving creme. Plus, you don&#x27;t have the risk of getting cut with this shaver!  One interesting thing I find is that the cleaning solution smells like fruity pebbles which I find very strange.</li>
    <li> Just got it today, hands down the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Fast, smooth and confortable.  I didn&#x27;t find it particularly noisy like some other reviewers did.  It&#x27;s actually more quiet than the Phillips I had before.</li>
    <li> I bought this in November of 2014. I love the battery life and the close shave. However, it consistently pulls a handful of hairs every shave - it hurts! It seems like it pulls from the edges of the shaver. Maybe I just need another foil cover. Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> So far so good.  My husband and two sons use this daily.  Makes their face baby soft.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> BRAUN Shaving products are not among the best, THEY ARE THE BEST shaving systems. I&#x27;ve tried everyhing on the market and once you have owned a Braun(especially 760 + series) you&#x27;ll never go back. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, once and a while I will use a gillet fusion razor to shave, but that&#x27;s usually if I&#x27;m without my Braun or in the shower and in a rush( this Braun shaver isn&#x27;t water proof).&lt;br /&gt;Braun offers a 60 day -\\&quot;try our razor for  2 months and if your not in love, we&#x27;ll give you every cent back to you\\&quot;!  Now that&#x27;s more than other companys offer.  So, try it! Worst that can happen is you&#x27;ll have a sleek, good looking, Self cleaning, German engineered, top of the line saver for 60 days. And you&#x27;ll get to use it for free( if you decide to get your $ back).&lt;br /&gt;But, Mark my words, YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE, KEEP THE BRAUN AND WONDER WHY YOU DIDN&#x27;T DO THIS SOONER!&lt;br /&gt;BRAUN TRUMPS ALL!!!!  Comes with charging/Cleaning station, power cord, brush, sleek semi hard yet soft case, cleaning solution cartrage, and instructions with guarantee.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 to 3 months now. The shaver has worked as promised. Love this a ton I use this on a weekly basis for an amateur like me its just perfect.</li>
    <li> I used rasors all my life and I decided to try an electric one. First I bought the Braun 5 series, at the beginning I did not get a close shave like the razor especially under the neck, but I noticed that every  time I use the electric shaver I have better and better shave. After about one month I had a better cleaner shave, my skin got used to it. So I decided to get the 7 series. I baught this one 7600cc, and it is far better than the 5 series, it has more power, the design and the pulsonic effect is great, and it gives me a better shave espically under the neck areas. The 5 series usually leaves behind few hairs under the neck, but the 7 series did a great job, I am keeping this one.   I was comparing between 7600cc and the 7900cc models, and decided to stick with this one, since it is little bit cheaper and it has the same technology and the same electric shaver, the only difference is the cleaning time, which is not really important, it already takes 20 min for the cleaning, so it is not a big deal.   Update: (12-27-2011)  Just a quick update, I also bought the Panasonic 4 blades, it works fine and faster than the Braun ones, it usually takes 10-15 min to shavewith the Braun shaver,, but with the panasonic it took me about 5-8 min. And it is smooth on my skin. I realize that every skin is different so do yourself a favor and try the Panasonic one as well, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> Good for shaving and easy to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;Led lamp for charging status is great.&lt;br /&gt;The design is good for me</li>
    <li> I am on my third Braun over several years. Overall I find it the best shave and I really like the cleaning mechanism. One of three I bought had an LCD display problem but Amazon replaced the unit immediately. The blades last about a year as they would on any electric razor. I would buy this unit again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> My husband had gotten rather lax in shaving.  I finally realized that it was the need to clean his old razor frequently that was the problem.  With the self cleaning Braun he is now shaving every day and I am a happy wife again.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve tried several brands over the years and have been most satisfied with Braun.  Good quality; well designed; reliable; close shave (especially for an electric).  I bought this model (Series 7-760cc) to replace a worn out Braun Activator (8000 Series, model 8595).  I miss the old one, only because I could get a good, close shave without going over the same areas as many times; the new one will do it, but it does take longer.</li>
    <li> the best shaver i have owned</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  The shave was not as close as expected, so I will  be returning this product.</li>
    <li> I love the Braun Series Shavers....excellent quality! Great Shaver!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a house warming gift. He&#x27;s always used disposable razors, so I thought he deserved a nice electric razor. Not to mention the fact that he has to shave everyday because he&#x27;s in the military, so it was greatly needed. We&#x27;ve had this razor for over three months and I cannot say anything wrong about this. He JUST now had to replace the cleaning inserts since we bought it. This razor makes his face so smooth and touchable and I just love how it feels. He loves the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin and that was a big deal for him. so this was a great razor and I reccomend this+++</li>
    <li> Still kicking! I&#x27;m sure I could use a new cartridge by now, but oh well.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase. Good close shave. Comfortable handling.&lt;br /&gt;Replaced Series 5 unit. Better shave.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend. Best shaver yet!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work. had to return to manufacterer. waiting for repair.  It was for my father.Trying to convince parents of asset to ordering online...........so far, not sold</li>
    <li> I bought two Braun shavers back in 2000-2001 - the 7570 and 7526 models, both with cleaners. One for my son (16 yrs old at the time) and one for myself. My son has since moved out and uses a blade, so I still have both of these shavers and they still work after about 15 years. The amazing thing is the batteries still hold enough power in both of them to last for a week worth of shaves, especially after one sat dormant without charging for a few years and it still works great.. I do change the foils and blades every year or so. I just saw one of the Cooltec models in the store today on sale and bought it, so I guess I&#x27;ll be retiring these two shavers and use them for backups or traveling. I highly recommend Braun shavers, they are not perfect in every aspect for everybody, but you&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth in longevity in my experience.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shaver. I have been using a panasonic for years and been quite satisfied. However there are almost no repair depots in the country and mine need fixing. So i figures that it is time to try a Braun again. I have been using it for 3 weeks and it is doing a bang up job. Hope it lasts for a few years.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this Braun Series 7 Shaver, and it is the best shaver that I have ever owned.  I replaced an older model Braun shaver, and this new model is far superior to the older model.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave smooth easy clean keeps long re-charge life. Very pleased with performance. Would recommend to others. Great deal .  Very pleased</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Braun 7526. The most important aspect -- how closely it shaves -- is basically the same.  I did a side-by-side comparison between the new device and the old one (with an old foil), and my wife couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. Not much of an upgrade, but I&#x27;ll give it four stars since my the old 7526 is a high bar to beat.</li>
    <li> Able to get silk skin smooth shaving, after some 60 - 90 seconds. Yes it take about a minute and one half to shave sufficientlt well so&lt;br /&gt;Eas to get my wife&#x27;s approval (+complement...)&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleaning by brush. Preferred to avoid the cleaning kit, since I keep my shaver in the bed room, thus avoiding the alcohole vapours.</li>
    <li> I love the razor, the way it performs and it&#x27;s feel in your hand. My only concern is the eventual cost of the unit given its requirements for cleaning. The manual suggests that you clean it every day however I&#x27;m starting by performing that task weekly. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Great! My husband loved it...no mess.</li>
    <li> Great shave and I also like the cleaning system (even though I will eventually have to pay for a new cleaning solution cartridge). In the past I only had a little brush to clean my Braun shaver. I have only owned Braun shavers for the past 15 years (this is my second one).</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  It does an excellent job of getting a very close shave.  I also like the self-cleaning feature, although it&#x27;s a bit noisy.</li>
    <li> About ten years ago I put away my Norelco 885 RX tri-headed rotary and started shaving with a safety razor, shaving soap, mug, and shaving brush.  The shave was much closer and I didn’t irritate my neck, which happened often with the Norelco.  Recently, I had to go on a weeklong trip and didn’t want to lug my mug, razor, and brush, so I took my old Norelco.  It didn’t shave as close as the safety razor, it no longer held a charge (I had to shave with it plugged in) and it irritated my neck, but it was much faster.  When I got home I looked at Consumers Reports and Amazon reviews and decided to buy a Braun series 7, the intermediate model 760 cc (whatever that means).  When I opened the package a slip of paper warned me that it would take about two weeks of daily shaves before the Braun would get as close as a rotary or a safety razor.  I decided to do my own experiment. I would  continue shaving the left side of my face, chin and neck with the Norelco and use my new Braun on the right side.  For the first week the Norelco shaved closer, but, as expected, it irritated my neck.  By the end of the second week the Braun had caught up and to my fingertips gave as close a shave as the Norelco, maybe even a little closer.  I decided to bring in independent judges, my two grandsons, ages 5 and 7.  I rubbed their tender cheeks, one side with my Norelco shave, the other with the Braun shave.  As they say in scientific jargon, they were double blinded (well sort of): neither knew which brand of razor I had applied to which side of my face and neither knew what his brother had decided.  The results were equivocal. One said there was no difference and the other said the Braun side was closer.  They refused to repeat the experiment.&lt;br /&gt; I decided to keep the Braun, mostly because it was too much trouble to return to Braun; the instructions said not to return it to Amazon.  The cleaning system adds on a few bucks a month for the cartridges and is too big and heavy to carry in anovernight case; the head has a finite lifetime according to Braun, which means replacing the cassette adds another expense.  (I’ve been using the same heads on the Norelco for years with no noticeable decrease in the quality of my shave.)  When I travel, I’ll take just the razor and the tiny brush to clean it manually. If I’m going to be away for more than a couple of weeks I’ll take the cord to keep it charged.  True, the Braun doesn’t irritate my skin, but I’ll tell you one thing: a safety razor with a good lather and hot water beats any electric any day.  It does take longer and occasionally cuts.  That’s the tradeoff.</li>
    <li> Just returned another company&#x27;s shaver after I questioned its quality control (plus I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the shave or the shaver built). Just purchased the 790cc4 and have used it for a few days - initial impressions: the shave is pretty good - no irritation (and I expect it to get better after my face conforms to the shaver). The shaver is solidly built and the cleaner works great. I am hard to satisy - but I do recommend this shaver (not the old 790 but the new one).</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun for my husband for Christmas.  I basically needed a self service razor that required little or no maintenance as my husband is the epitome of not wanting to do any maintenance.  He has only used it a couple times and says that it almost does as good of a job as his old Gillette Fusion. This little system checks the quality and cleanliness of the blade each time the razor is placed back into the cleaning/charging station.  It waits for &#x27;permission&#x27; before it does a cleaning cycle which is nice due to the fact that it saves on cleaning fluid and excessing cleaning on the blades.  This will also be nice when he goes on business trips as it states that it has a 50h usage time in between complete charges.  So far, it has been a nice investment.</li>
    <li> The very best razor I have ever had, I enjoy using it, it is fun does a great close shave which is important for old retired Military guy.  I also use the self cleaner after every use.  expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have used an electric shaver for many years.  I have tried a number of brands, but was disappointed by each one.  Even the best shaver I used in the past would still miss some flat lying hairs on my neck and the blades and screen wore out quickly. After a month or two, shaving was abrasive to my skin and it hurt to shave. Having never tried a Braun shaver before, I was a little reluctant to spend the extra money to purchase one, but I finally decided to give this shaver a try, and am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after years of frustration with previous electric shavers, I decided to go ahead and spend the money and buy the Braun Series 7 760cc Shaver System.  Man, am I impressed.  I got a close, clean shave every time, not just the very first time.  This shaver did not miss a single hair on my neck (a problem with all shavers I used in the past).  It delivered a shave equally as close as a razor without the nicks and cuts a razor can leave.  The pivoting head makes it easy to shave areas difficult to reach and reduces the time spent shaving.  The razor did not burn my face and I could wear cologne right after shaving without my face burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What convinced me to buy the shaver is one of its best features, the clean and renew system.  After each shave, the clean and renew system thoroughly cleans and renews the blades for the next shave.  When finished cleaning the blades, a heating element dries the blades.  In minutes it is ready for the next shave.  I was skeptical of how well it could automatically clean itself, but it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to use the clean and renew system after each shave, you can skip a shave or use water to clean the blades, but I would recommend you use the clean and renew feature after every shave.  No more cleaning clipped hair from the blades and running a brush through the blades to clean it.  The clean and renew system does all the cleaning for you, and even dries the blades once the solution is finished cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other nice feature is the shaver can be used with the cord while shaving if the battery is depleted.  This is a great feature for traveling, when you might not want to take the clean and renew system with you.  My previous shavers would not work with the cord if the battery was dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are supposed to last 18 months with this shaver.  If so, the shaver will eventually pay for itself.  The blades on my previous shaver had to be replaced every 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the initial cost of the shaver may appear prohibitive, it is well worth the money.  The closer shave, reduced shaving time, and fewer blade replacements certainly justify the initial expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this shaver highly enough, especially for men already using an electric shaver and are disappointed in the results.feature is the shaver can be used with the cord while shaving if the battery is depleted.

    <li> Just bought this product in the store (Target) for $245.00!!!  I dont like buying things online due to the return hassle.  Anyways, I hate to say it but this is not a good shaver.  I had high hopes for it but it does not give a close shave.  It shaves close on the face but misses a TON of hairs on the neck. No matter what I did (shave against the grain, pull skin tight, shave in all directions, etc) it would not clip alot of the neck hairs. Im just a regular guy with nothing unusual about my facial hair.  It looks cool and the cleaning station is all fancy and crap but at the end of the day It does not give a close shave.  I do not mind spending alot of money to get a close shave but this just didnt do it.  Im shocked that for this price it wasnt better.  Im disappointed and Im returning this.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable machine much better than my original Braun, which must be at least 25 years old.The cleaning and recharging tower work perfectly.</li>
    <li> If you have to clean up your electric shaver&#x27;s work with a razor every time, you&#x27;re not saving yourself time, or convenience, or skin irritation, or money.  This shaver sports a hefty price tag, but the only real bell and whistle you&#x27;re getting is the opportunity to buy a $20 refill cartridge every two months... designed to evaporate in 60 days regardless of whether you use it to clean the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s $10/mo. Put into perspective, that&#x27;s a Spotify premium account you&#x27;re spending for a shave that is every bit as mediocre as every other electric shaver in this design, especially on the neck.  I&#x27;ll be returning mine quite soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product was listed as Amazon Prime, but took a week to arrive, while all other items in the order came in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for 18 months now.  I bought this model to replace the simple Norelco rotary shaver my father gave me when I first started shaving in my early teens.  I was attracted to this product originally because of the self-cleaning feature.  Overall I like the product, but it isn&#x27;t perfect.  I get a good shave with it, and the cleaning system is a great convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a good, close shave on the face, under the chin, and along the jawline.  It is possible, but difficult, to get a close shave on the neck, which seems to be a limitation of many electric shavers.  It&#x27;s also difficult to get a good shave on the upper lip, which surprises me a little bit because I&#x27;d think that wouldn&#x27;t be a difficult surface to shave.  I have fairly sensitive skin, but none of the three shave intensity settings irritate my skin more than the others -- I usually use the higher setting when I&#x27;m in more of a rush, and I never use the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The locking slide on the shaver head broke off within the first two months of using the shaver, and even when it wasn&#x27;t broken, it didn&#x27;t lock the shaver head with enough force to actually keep it from moving.  This problem didn&#x27;t affect the number of stars I gave the shaver because I don&#x27;t use the lock very much, and I don&#x27;t personally regard it as a particularly important feature of a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic cleaning feature of the shaver, in my opinion the most important and attractive feature, replaces the need to daily empty and clean the shaver, as you do with other electrics.  It does not entirely eliminate the need to remove the shaver cassette and clean the cassette and head internals, however.  The cleaning cartridges last for about 30 uses as advertised, and I usually remove the shaver cassette when replacing the cleaning cartridge and clean the internals under running water as with a conventional electric shaver using an old electric toothbrush dedicated for cleaning purposes.  The automatic cleaning solution has pleasant, clean scent, and the solution seems to keep the shaver head lubricated.  It never feels like I&#x27;m shaving with dry, dull metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed in the last couple of days that the finish on the shaver body near the head has started to flake off.  The finish isn&#x27;t covered by the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty, and I don&#x27;t believe at this point that it will affect the performance of the shaver, but I also don&#x27;t like to appear as though I own poorly made products.</li>
    <li> parts broke in two years</li>
    <li> this product was purchased for my husband..he tried it for a while, but could not get a close enough shave to keep it..it was returned within 30 days with a refund</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic razors for years, having gone through 3 of them as the batteries would eventually die as all batteries will. This time I decided to try the Braun. I am very glad that I did so. The Panasonic shaves close, this one is even closer, and does a much better job on the spots on my face that for some reason resist getting close. The Braun is generates far fewer decibels of buzzing, another big plus. Additionally, I could never get a full week&#x27;s worth of shaves from a single charge on the Panasonic. In the month that I have owned the Braun, it has easily lasted for a week&#x27;s seven shaves. It is much simpler to charge only once weekly. So on all these counts, the Braun wins. It also feels more solid and better engineered.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun electric shaver for my husband for his birthday.  He has owned another Braun shaver which he was very happy with but it finally gave out after five years of regular use.  This shaver cost more than twice the price of his old shaver but does not shave nearly as close.  Returning shaver under 30 day satification guarantee.  Hope return is handled as promised by Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for over 25 years.  I&#x27;ve had several other Brauns...but this razor is awesome.  I marvel at how completely smooth it gets my face and with minimal shaving effort.  This really is a great razor!</li>
    <li> This thing is damn good! The only regret I have is not buying this sooner. Close shave, no irritation, and no more cuts. I&#x27;ve read complaints about spending 50 bucks on a replacement head... that&#x27;s after 18 months! That&#x27;s a long time to have to worry about changing a blade. Also, complaints about the refills for the refills for the cleaning station are pointless... just rinse the blade under water, and presto, it is clean. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this razor...I found mine on eBay for $165, so look around... won&#x27;t regret that you did.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I had to make an exception for this product. Close enough to a blade shave that I won&#x27;t be using blades anymore. Cleaning and charging system are simple and foolproof. Just terrific!</li>
    <li> The shaver head lock switch broke after less than 4 months of purchase.  I called the Braun rep, and was told they could not replace the shaver or the part, but they would give me the address of the nearest service center, where I could send the shaver in and wait for (probably) several months with no shaver.</li>
    <li> I came back to the Braun 7 series after trying some electric shavers. It&#x27;s not perfect but it does a better job than anything else out there and lasts longer to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an extremely thick beard beard. I sometimes have to trim some troublesome whiskers with a disposable razor, but the Braun 7 series doors very well overall. It also works well if I skip a day of shaving. The Braun 7 series is the only shaver I&#x27;ve tried that works at all of I ship shaving for 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would STRONGLY recommend using some kind of preshave product. You will get much less irritation and a closer shave. I use Lab Series Electric Shave Solution preshave. You can buy it on Amazon, but I can actually get it cheaper at my local Macy&#x27;s. Works much better than William&#x27;s &#x27;Electric Shave. I&#x27;ve also use Remington Face Saver. It works slightly better than the Lab Series for me, but it is a dry product with a lot of talc in it. My wife doesn&#x27;t like the mess it makes. It also gets inside my shavers, and I think has contributed to the premature death of some of them, including my previous Braun 7 series.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It has given me the closest shaves I have ever had with an electric shaver.  I like the cleaning features. It is easy to use and with the cleaning features should give years of good performance.</li>
    <li> My husband said this was the best shave he received from an electric shaver yet it was gentle on his sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Gives a close shave if used as directed but more money than needs to be spent for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor. I like the cleaning function. However, I find myself finishing the job with a disposable razor in the shower.</li>
    <li> Offers as close a shave as one could expect with an electric shaver.,&lt;br /&gt;Appeared more complex than I recall the older models, but easy to set up.</li>
    <li> I have been forever a razor guy... I have tried all of the newest, best razors you can buy... None of them was I really happy with, and I just wanted to put an end to it!    I decided to look up reviews for another electric, as my previous rotary shaver was stolen by TSA a few years back... Only a week or two old so I never got to really get used to it as much as I wanted. It left me irritated and the shave just not as smooth as manual. After that, I was hesitant to buy another electric.    I looked up reviews and found this one... Reviews looked good enough, so I went for it. This razor though, is incredible. Just one week into shaving with it, I am ecstatic about this razor. My face is as smooth, if not smoother then when I shave with a manual blade. No irritation, less hassle and no more tugging and pain! The automatic cleaner is excellent and just so easy to use! I am so happy I don&#x27;t have to touch another manual razor.    I highly recommend this product, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I am not even out of the \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; period of the razor, and the shave is incredible. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It is the only electric razor that will shave all the whiskers on my face and neck without irritating my neck.  Clean-up after is as simple as replacing the shaver in its stand and pushing a button. The next time I use it, it is clean and ready to go.</li>
    <li> ok.. I don&#x27;t usually do reviews but Amazon sent me an email so I was like why not.. Everything about this shaver is good/excellent.  the only thing I did not like was the trimmer.. it flips up and is not as nice as on the braun 360 complete... other than that.. this shaver is completely worth it.. it glides over your skin and probably in one pass it is able to get every single hair...</li>
    <li> I had been using an older 3 series Braun for far too long.  I wasn&#x27;t very good about shaving daily and the performance of the old razor was to blame.  This new series 7 razor provides a much more comfortable and quicker shave, so this time around my face has become accustomed to the razor faster which means I shave more often.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the button; I keep wanting to slide a plate to start the razor like my old model.  I really like the cleaning function, but being tied to an additional accessory beyond just changing the blades is kind of a pain.  So far I like the result of running the cleaning cycle, so I am hoping it really does prolong the life of the blades, and it makes the razor smell nice.  The blue light on the charging dock is very bright, so you either have to unplug it at night, or direct the light away from where you are sleeping.  The charging/cleaning dock takes up a fair amount of counter space, but you don&#x27;t have to use it all the time.  The razor came with a travel bag and small brush, and the charging cord can be plugged straight into the razor instead of the cleaning dock.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test the battery life as mine resides in the dock most of the time.  It gives me a nice shave, and it was a good deal.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a change from a Norelco and so far this is much better.  It&#x27;s easier to hold and to fit in under the nose and chin, etc. It doesn&#x27;t take as many passes to cut the hair.  The cleaning system is very handy too. No complaints.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun and I could not be happier.  My only complaint is that it is expensive but overall it is worth it for something you will use everyday.  Treat yourself!  Close shave with no irritation.</li>
    <li> great deal.. got this on sale and I am very happy with it.. Like many of the others here.. In a quest to find the perfect shaver I tried several other Norelco&#x27;s and Brauns...  There is not one shaver that Stands out as being SOOO much better than the others.. They all have their strong points..&lt;br /&gt;This does the job as expected..</li>
    <li> the best choice for a first shaver for my 17 year old son !When this one wears out,he will get another Braun !</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my (quite old) Norelco rotary shaver.  I appreciate the close shave, and my wife appreciates the self-contained cleaning system.  She was getting tired of clippings all over the bathroom.  My Norelco lasted a good 4 years, and I expect this to do the same or better.</li>
    <li> Background&lt;br /&gt;I have only used a Gillette Fusion Razor previous to owning my Braun 760. I have to be dressed professionally for work everyday so i am shaving quite often. I could get away with shaving 2 or 3 times a week, about every other day. My hair does not grow back that fast, and only gets mildly thick after about 4 days of not shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery Life&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely great! I only charge this thing every other week after moderate use. The battery lasts and lasts.  great point about charging is that you can plug the cord directly into the charger, it doesn&#x27;t have to charge on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave&lt;br /&gt;I think it does a great job. Now let me also say that it took about 3 weeks of shaving for my hair/face to adapt to the shaver. This might sound stupid, but it&#x27;s true. The first few weeks, shaving took 10-15 minutes. It was very repetitive and a bit frustrating. But the more I used the shaver, not only did i become more comfortable with it, but I am able to get a closer shave now. It&#x27;s like the hair grows in, in such a way to make the shaver more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to follow the directions on how to hold the shaver etc (again it seems like a no brainer but it helps to avoid frustration) and to give this shaver at least 30 days of trial. Braun gives you a 60 day guarantee, so you can always back out.&lt;br /&gt;I have to shave about every other day in order to keep everything smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;So, the cartridge comes off easily and the included brush is adequate for cleaning the shaver and cartridge. You can also run it under warm/hot water to clean it up. The stand itself does a good job cleaning as well. But this is a bit of a rub for me. After 1 use, I will clean it all up with my brush, etc and the base still says it&#x27;s at level 1 dirty (3 levels total). Now I wont use the auto clean function except for every other week. Otherwise I would be using it after each shave, and i don&#x27;t want to waste the cleaning solution like that. Now granted, it will do a different level of cleaning depending on how dirty the shaver is, but I wouldn&#x27;t even worry about it.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you manually clean after each shave, you can afford to use the auto cleaner weekly or bi-weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with the shaver. Sure there are little bits I&#x27;m not a big fan of, but this shaver met or exceeded my expectations, even at the price that I paid for it. It was money well spent for me. It makes my life easier now, and I have a more consistent shave in less time than I did while using my manual razor. I can shave in 5 minutes in the mornings now instead of the night before with my razor.&lt;br /&gt;Based on my level of satisfaction I think this product deserves 5 Stars.depending on how dirty the shaver is, but I wouldn&#x27;t even worry about it.

    <li> I like this Shaver a lot; however, if I do not shave for 2 or 3 days, the shaver has a tough time with my thick and long beard. It is great for an everyday shaver, but when I go a few days with out shaving, I use the Panasonic ES-LA93-K Men&#x27;s Shaver. I have owned both for more than 6 months and in the compare and contrast I would give the Bruan points for close shave and would give the Panasonic points for being able to handle a tougher and longer beard.</li>
    <li> I have had bad luck with other brand shavers and bought this device out of desperation, thinking that an expensive, top of the line shaver HAS to work. It did its job and absolutely gave me a smooth and close face. It gave me a wonderful shave at the beginning and I never had a break in period. And I appreciate not having to clean the shaver manually. I would give it 5 stars if the little knob which is supposed to lock the shaver in place and stop it from contouring one&#x27;s face had worked. So much for German Engineering!</li>
    <li> I am using my wife&#x27;s account to write this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Braun 760cc electric shaver, type 5693, two months ago, when my old and reliable Braun 6520 died after 15 years of constant use. The difference is so huge between the two shavers that it shows how much evolution the Braun shavers went through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smoothness of the head/foil is incredible. I feel now like if I had shaved with a sandpaper before.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the electric motor is a lot more noiseless than my 6520. That makes a difference in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Third, vibration in the handle is almost nonexistent. With the 6520, if I had to shave a two days beard, I could end up with a numbed thumb. That is not the case anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the battery seems to hold its charge much longer, although I don&#x27;t really remember for how long I could shave with my 6520 when I first bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I am quite pleased with this new shaver and would recommend it to a friend without hesitation. The 760cc is the third electric and Braun shaver I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2012-02-10&lt;br /&gt;There is a \\&quot;flaw\\&quot; in the design of the Braun cleaning system. The long hair trimmer socket will get dirty over time, if you don&#x27;t clean your shaver after each shaving, as the cleaning station does not reach it. One way to clean it, then, is to use the brush, but this tool doesn&#x27;t do a great job, since it doesn&#x27;t reach all the deeper spots in the socket. Best way to do it is to blow some air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2012-11-05&lt;br /&gt;I lower the rating from 5 to 3 stars, because after only one year of 7 days a week use, the Braun 760cc started to make a strange noise. Sporadically at first, then every day. Still under warranty, I shipped it back last week and it turned out they had to replace the head and the electric motor (they had to, because both parts are tied together). Wow! Just after one year of normal use (I never dropped the shaver). This is no good news for the future, especially if one partfails, you need to replace both and pay for both. Service was excellent, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2013-10-24&lt;br /&gt;I lower the rating from 3 to 2 stars, because the base of the cleaning system now leaks like a tap and spills all the liquid over the counter. It is unusable and I am left with the hand cleaning option only. The quality of the whole system is definitively low and I should look at another brand when time comes to change my electric shaver. Very disappointed by this Braun shaver. I keep the rating at 2 because it does shave well, but the quality has really gone downhill.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Series 7 769cc for about a month now. Comparing it to an old Philips i had been using, this is an amazing shaver. In summary, i&#x27;ll list the pros and cons i&#x27;ve experienced with this shaver:    Pros:  1. Came packaged very neatly and in a professional manner  2. Charger can take a very good range of voltage so that it can be used in most countries  3. Charging time only takes about 1 hour or less  4. Shaving after cleaning (ex. a few hours or the day after) gives you a very smooth feeling and shaving does in fact feel much better  5. Very easy to use, yet it includes options regarding the power of the shave you want  6. Does not seem to \\&quot;shave less\\&quot; after running for a few minutes    Cons:  1. Shaving time (at least for me) is surely not 5 mins every time if I shave everyday. For me, shaving time is between 10-25 mins depending on whether I shave everyday or three times a week  2. Cleaning fluids are costly, and somehow I can&#x27;t buy them from Amazon since they don&#x27;t deliver to Malta  3. Even if you wash the shaver under water and soap, the cleaning set still shows you that you need to clean the shaver. This means that, either how much cleaning is needed is calculated on the time the shaver is run, or washing the shaver head under water and soap does not clean the shaver by 100%  4. Some cuts and skin burning feeling after shaving, however this is due acne breakouts, although it takes a whole week to heal again so it&#x27;s rather awkward going out and looking partially red, partially white.    Another point I wish to make is that, for me, the areas on the left and right side under the chin are the most difficult to shave. In fact, sometimes I cut my skin shaving due to the amount of many times I try to shave that part. I don&#x27;t know if this is common for all electric shavers, but my old philips did not cut my skin, although it shave as deeply as this braun one.    Overall I&#x27;ve given it a five star rank, as it is a very good shaver and gives you thebaby-face feeling after shaving, which lasts a couple of hours. Btw, for those who have recently bought it or are considering buying it and wish to save up on cleaning cartridges, try to clean the shaver under water everyday and then clean it using the shaving set once a week. This way, a cartridge can be used for two months.</li>
    <li> For 5 years I was using Norelco 8894xl, the top of the line of shavers at that time. Very reliable, it never gave me any problem during 5 years but this Braun 7 Series is very impressive. The shaving is much closer and no irritation at all. I just wish it will last me as long the Norelco. 50 minutes of shaving is less than half than the 120 minutes I was getting with norelco but its still long enough for a week of shaving. I have sensitive skin. Norelco used to give me bumps at the neck area and also irritated the skin if I tried to get a closer shave. I couldn&#x27;t shave every day because I wanted the skin to heal before the next shave.  Braun is much much better, much closer shave. Neck area is always need a little more time but the shaver doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin even if you press hard against the skin. I wanted to buy both, this and the new norelco shaver, try them both and keep the best but I&#x27;m so happy with this one that I don&#x27;t want to go back to rotating shavers any more. I highly recommend to try this shave. Braun give you also 60 days customer satisfaction to try it.</li>
    <li> I had seen many positive reviews for this product and I decided to give it a shot.  As a member of the military, I have to shave every day, and, while I love having a perfectly smooth face after a shave with my Gillette Fusion, I basically need to switch the blade at least once a week in order to save my face from irritation.  I have used electric shavers before (mostly norelco), and I could never stick with them because, no matter how hard I tried, I could never get my face to feel smooth after shaving with an electric.  After purchasing this product, I must say that I&#x27;m impressed.  It is not as close as I can get with a blade, but it is very close to it.  The trimmer does an excellent job on my side burns, and the shaver has caused no irritation and seems to be getting better every time I use it.  This is the first time that I&#x27;ve actually believed that the &#x27;adjustment period&#x27; for electric razors is real.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, and every day the shave has felt a bit closer.  The only reason that I wouldn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars is because it is very loud.  I&#x27;ll have to get creative when I&#x27;m deployed in order not to wake my bunk-mates up when I shave... or when I&#x27;m cleaning my blade.  I&#x27;m also realizing that the cost savings won&#x27;t be that great over purchasing disposable blades since I&#x27;ll have to replace the cleaning solution monthly, but overall, this product is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver in hopes of reducing the amount of stress was causing to my face, and am I glad I did. I was having problems with regular gillette razors and was causing damage to my skin as I have some acne. I tried using the Norelco 3 disc shaver but found that it wasn&#x27;t shaving very well. I decided to try the Braun Series 7 style shaver and got great results from the first time I used it.   Not only is it easy to clean, but it holds its charge for about 1 week (used every day of the week) and also stays sharp. I have had this product for about 3 months and have yet to have a single issue. From rugged skin to sensitive skin, this is a quality product that won&#x27;t give you any problems.   The tilt settings of the hear are fantastic as it allows the head to swivel and take the shape of my jaws geometry easily without missing a hair. If you are looking for a product to get the job done on a daily basis, then go for this product as it will not let you down!</li>
    <li> I tried this shaver for a month, and I really wanted to like it.  Technically, it&#x27;s better than the older versions Braun made, but I really didn&#x27;t think I got as good a shave with this one.  Ultimately, I sent it back to Braun for a refund.  You should note that Amazon will not accept returns of this product.  You have to send it directly to Braun and wait weeks to get your money back, which comes to you on a Visa Debit Card.  You also are responsible for paying the shipping cost of sending it back.  That is not the most customer friendly approach for either Braun or Amazon.  I ended up buying a replacement foil and cutter block set for my old Braun, and I&#x27;m back in business.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun 760cc shaver because I was tired of all the razor burn and irritation that came with using a blade every day. I ended up getting this one and the Norelco 3D to see which one was the best. I tried both shavers for a week and the Braun came out the victor.  The Braun gave a more consistent shave. Some days the Norelco would miss small patches of hair here or there. The Braun got my entire face consistently smooth.   The Braun got the edge in closeness as well. After the shave, I felt like I had just shaved with blade. Nice and smooth even in the trouble areas on the neck. The Norelco also gave a good shave. It was just about as close, but the Braun just felt slightly closer.  When it came to irritation the Braun really had advantage here. I felt no irritation at all after my shave. With the Norelco, I consistently had some slight irritation on the neck. I could have lived with it just fine if the shave would have been closer.   The only place that I give the Norelco the edge is in shave time. It only takes about 3-4 min to shave with the Norelco. It takes about 5-6 to shave with the Braun.   Overall both shavers were great. I wanted something to use every day, and I found it in the Braun. It is much nicer to wake up and shave with the electric instead of dragging the blade across my face. After the shave, all I have to do is stick it in the cleaning stand hit the button and go about my day.</li>
    <li> Shaver works great. Highly recommended. However, it was more expensive with the automatic cleaning base. Also, if you buy the refill cleaning cartridges like they expect you to, then you will be spending money on this razor for a long time...so make sure to look up how to refill it yourself with isopropyl alcohol or something.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for 10 weeks.  It does a very nice job, although I find that going over some areas of my neck with a safety razor is necessary for best results.  The cleaning/lubricating system is great, and I assume using it daily will extend the life of the shaving elements.  Using it daily, I find the reservoir will last about 6 weeks.  The shaver itself is well-made and feels good in hand.  The base does not match the shaver in quality, but gets the job done.  Amazon seems to have the best price on this, beating my local Wal-Mart by $50.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun 8585 for years and years now, but it was really showing its age.  The motor had definitely lost its pep and it had been grabbing and not cutting nicely for awhile now.  I kept the blades clean, I replaced the cutting block regularly, but it was just getting old.  My wife picked up a new Braun 5 series at a local shop. I tried to like it but I hated it. I can&#x27;t remember everything from that far back, but overall it did a terrible job shaving. I shopped and read reviews endlessly for weeks until my old razor had finally just about died.     I&#x27;ve had the new razor about 4 weeks now. Very happy with this choice. What was taking me 5-7 minutes each morning with the old now takes about 2-3 minutes with the new razor.  It&#x27;s got plenty of power to handle multiple days worth of growth for after those nice long weekends when I just didn&#x27;t feel like shaving.  It does a very decent job with hard to shave areas under the neck, although I think this could be a little better.    It was listed at $250 locally, I went to buy at Best Buy when they came down to $200 but I missed the sale.  That&#x27;s when I turned online and found a great price at Amazon-$165 was totally worth it! I got it with Free super saver shipping and it arrived much earlier than expected, 2 days (during Christmas shipping crunch, no less)!    I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the market for a new razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Braun 760 for a few months now and it is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It cuts almost as close as a razor with absolutely no irritation. I highly recommend this razor to anyone that is looking to improve their shave or mornings in general.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m very unlucky to receive this item Dead on Arrival. I ordered this shaver on Black Friday because it is 50 USD cheaper at that time. At first the ETA is December 27 which is after Christmas. But after a few days I was excited to find out its ETA is earlier. Today I receive the item and want to give it a try. The problem is it cannot hold a charge. This is very annoying because I can only use it with the charger on( I charged it properly for 3 hours and if I plug off the charger it will not work). The shaver is okay, it gives me closer shave compared to my previous $20 shaver(cons: too expensive), but when it cannot hold charge, it would be useless. I have read some of the reviews on the same Series 7-790 sating the same problem and that guy choose to contact Braun and bring it to Braun&#x27;s customer service. This item is special because of the cleaning liquid prevent it from being returned by yourself. But as an Amazon customer for 2 years, I want to give the customer service of Amazon a try. I contact them via the live-chat, and surprisingly, they issue a full refund without any problem. It does save me much time and energy to talk with Braun guys. I know this is a product review, but it is also a shopping experience review as we come here to shop on Amazon, and if you meet a problem, I have 100% confident that Amazon will make it out for you. Be to contact them first and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I can still keep the shaver and use it at home, and buy another one for travel. I&#x27;m also more confident about Amazon&#x27;s customer service.</li>
    <li> It does provide a close shave.  The cleaning system does work effectively for the shaver (not suppose to do the trimmer).    Cautionary note: there is as small \\&quot;hole\\&quot; in the cleaner where the liquid flows back into the reservoir.  Keep this clean;  it tends to clog with shavings.  If you don&#x27;t the cleaner will spill the liquid and use up the liquid very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have never used electric shavers until now because I never felt I got a close shave. This shaver does a fairly good job of getting what I consider a close shave, better than any other electric I have had. The cleaning system is excellent, and it holds a charge for over a week on trips.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace a several year-old Braun 7 series and I mostly prefer the new design.  I think the 7-760 does a better job of shaving and saves me time each morning.  The design of the charger/cleaning station is much better as well.  I had given up on the old charger style after the locking mechanism failed.  This design just has the shaver drop into place and is much less likely to give problems.  The cleaning cycles are noisy, but seem to work well.  I do find it difficult to correctly place the shaver in the cleaner/charger without having to jiggle it into place, but it isn&#x27;t a big deal. I&#x27;d still like to see an electric shaver that made a revolutionary improvement in shaving time each morning, but for now this is a very good incremental improvement over older designs.  A solid 4 star performer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other electric razors and have dealt with my fair share of disappointment. I haven&#x27;t had it more than a few days so I can&#x27;t comment on things like the longevity of the cleaning system, but I have to say that this is far and away the most effective electric razor I&#x27;ve ever dealt with. We all know that no electric razor is going to be quite as close as an against-the-grain shave with a blade, but this must be as close as I can think to get with all of the convenience that you get from an electric.  I wholeheartedly recommend. There&#x27;s a reason that even Consumer Reports rates this one so highly.</li>
    <li> This is a solid shaver, fast and close. Good ergonomics for hold and maneuver. Really good cosmetics, the light with the power button is a nice touch. The ability to clean using the tap is a big plus when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a 8xxx series before this and its battery died after 4 years so decided to try out the newer breed of Pulsonic shavers. 760cc is an improvement but not enough to be feel impressed about -- which is disappointing (hence the 4 stars). The biggest difference in shave experience is that 760cc is faster and easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 760cc comes with a fitting semi-hard case with zippers. I find this an improvement over the old hard case which was awkward for packing.</li>
    <li> it is beautiful.so is cool!l love Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver  very mone than .......thanks amazon...</li>
    <li> After 40 years of traditional razor shaving I went through a period of nicks and cuts from the new and ever more expensive over the counter razors.  Over the years I had given electrics a try more than once only to give them up due to unsatisfactory shaves. From day 1 the Braun gave me a close and comfortable shave. It&#x27;s quick and easy. I like the built in cleaning system as it keeps things simple and reliable.  I&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day, sometimes more than once a day, and I love it!  It shave close without irritating my skin!</li>
    <li> This shaver works some much better than the model we had previously. Very happy with this series.  A clean, close shave!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase.  This product amazed me.  Went through 1/8\\&quot; of stubble no problem at all.  I dreaded using it...remembered the \\&quot;pull\\&quot; of the old days on long hair.  The micro vibrations slogan must work.  Painless, waterless quick (and real) shaving.  Thanks Braun.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. You get a very clean shave. much better than old one from another company. I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I ever got.  I had an old Braun that I used for years but it broke so I got this one.  The shave is much closer than the old braun.  This is more expensive than some of the cheaper electric shavers out there but I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this shaver.  I like Braun&#x27;s simpler foil shavers and I&#x27;ve avoided the big, self cleaning types.  But the fact is that the Series 7 shaves well, has different settings for flexibility, and the self-clean feature actually works.  On the topic of self-cleaning:  I was skeptical that shaver would have me cleaning it often just so I&#x27;d have to buy more expensive cleaning fluid.  While it&#x27;s true that system &amp;#34;suggests&amp;#34; a cleaning every day or two, I&#x27;ve had this for several months, self-cleaned regularly, and the indicator says I&#x27;ve still got 2/3 of my cleaning fluid life left.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement for my Braun 8985 because the new blades did not work very well.  It still worked and shaved pretty well, but after many years and a battery replacement it was time for a new one.  I looked at the reviews and bought this one. It shaves very well, even better than my 8985. I would recommend it if you have used a Braun before.</li>
    <li> When my Braun 8585 battery died, I decided to step up to a new model rather than fixing the old one.  I am very happy I did.  The new one is quieter, shaves faster and closer, and is more \\&quot;ergonomic\\&quot; (lighter and thinner in a way that fits my hand better).  The \\&quot;pop-out\\&quot; trimmer took some getting used to, but right from the start it was obvious I had better control than with the design on the 8585 as I can actually see what I am doing now.  All in all a nice improvement over my last shaver which I liked as well and did last me a good long time.  Braun shavers are expensive but well worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift to my dad.</li>
    <li> I shave most mornings, and this shaver never leaves me sore or with any discomfort. Additionally the ease of cleaning and sterilizing the shaver is simple.</li>
    <li> Very good razor. Better then last Braun. Close shave. Good at getting long neck hairs. Recommend this razor it does the job.</li>
    <li> I am not sure of the hype on this razor.  I purchased over a year ago and I am somewhat fair skinned not alot of hair and it seems it takes forever to shave.  I have to shave over the same areas three or four times to be close shave.  Not happy at all.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver!</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Even though this is my first shaver, switching from a manual razor, I had no irritation whatsoever (even though the manual said that it would take 1-3 weeks for you to adjust).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that in 2-3 slow passes, keeping the shaver in constant contact with my skin, it can completely and smoothly shave my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the cost of the cleaning solution, and the fact that shaver seems to decide whether it&#x27;s dirty or not based on how many times you use it (as opposed to some measurement of how dirty the device actually is). It seems to time how long you use it, and once you use it for a certain amount of time it decides that the device is dirty (and requires cleaning with the expensive cleaning solution) even if you clean it yourself. I understand that it needs to be lubricated and all, and I can always not push the button to clean it (which is what I do), but I think it&#x27;s somewhat deceptive to have it tell you that the device is dirty and make you use up cleaning solution even when it isn&#x27;t dirty.</li>
    <li> Day 2, I find it really is right for me.  Works well, shaves great.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
    <li> So, i bought one of these, dreaming of fast, easy, close shaves, adding minutes to to the harried mornings of a single dad. Didn&#x27;t pan out. Yes, I shave before my shower (as recommended), but any hopes of time savings are dashed as I have to go over and over the same patch of face 6 or 8 times (god forbid I leave it to get long, 5 or 6 days, as I&#x27;ll have to double the number of tries), sometimes in a scrubbing motion, with the grain, against the grain, sideways to the grain, to make sure that I&#x27;ve gotten all of the hairs. Then, sometimes I miss hairs and I&#x27;m worrying at them all day, like a loose tooth. Granted, the parts that are shaved are done closely.  With a blade, 1 or 2 swipes and the hairs are cut and I know if I&#x27;ve missed any hairs because the lack of shaving cream in a particular area is a good indicator of razed ground.  So, for me, shaving with this (and I&#x27;v been doing it for about 5 months) is slow and returns uneven results - I&#x27;m going back to razors.</li>
    <li> Having never paid more than $85 for an electric shaver this price was very high. However it got good reviews in CR so I bought it. Very impressive shave, the closest I have ever had, with no long hairs missed. I took on 18 day trip and the battery did not need recharging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used braun and I&#x27;ve been shaving since I was 14 but the first one I used was my dads super old one. Then my older brother got one and I used it, then my dad got a new one and I was using it till the foil broke and he refused to get a new foil. So I decided to get my own and this thing works great. Real nice close shave and the smaller trimmer works great for me. The dock says its dirty by the about of battery use, so I rarely use it since I hand clean it but the dock does a good job but is kinda noisy</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a Panasonic that had reached end of life.  i consider shaving a necessary once a day task.  I just want a clean shave with as little hassle as possible.  The Braun does just that.  Once over, no stray whiskers.  Then I put it back in the holder and push a button.  It is charged, cleaned and ready the next morning.  The unit uses very little counter space, and doesn&#x27;t look bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a cleaning cycle whenever the LED indicates that a cleaning is needed, which is generally every day.  Based on the debris collected in the cleaning cartridge at replacement time, the cleaning is very effective and I think less frequent cleaning, while it may extend the life of the cleaning fluid, is not worth it.</li>
    <li> Not as close as a blade, but a very good product.  Well designed and engineered with simple operation.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good upgrade from my last razor which was the 3 series. I recommend it for anyone with medium facial hair growth. The storage dock is sleek looking and keeps things organized in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Got it as a Deal of the Day and it&#x27;s worth every penny. Close shave overall, but I have had to do another pass under the chin area. One issue: The first time it went through the cleaning process, the fluid leaked from the bottom of the container. Maybe it was overfilled? That hasn&#x27;t happened since.</li>
    <li> Very pleased after years of disappointment with norelco. Very clean shave. You have to give it a solid week to get used to it</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun electric shaver since 1971. The 7-760cc is by far the best, so far. I&#x27;ve been using this model for about a month now and I highly recommend it. The only drawback I have found would be the trimmer. It is different than I am accustomed to but it isn&#x27;t that big of a problem. I&#x27;m really pleased with this Braun.</li>
    <li> It took me 3 days to be convinced, but I&#x27;m throwing out my shaving cream. My shave this morning is as close as my Fusion Power and with the added benefit of not hacking up my neck.    Don&#x27;t buy the 790CC. For the extra money you are buying a different paint job, an LCD vs LED battery display, and a 25 second clean feature. The only feature that might be useful is the 25 second clean, because a full clean takes 45 minutes, but save yourself the money and hit the clean button when you leave for work in the morning.    I have sensitive skin and constantly end up with cuts and razor burn on my neck. As a result since I work from home, I&#x27;ve taken to only shaving when I absolutely have to(nights out with the wife, business trips). So most of the time I look like a hobo/hermit. So let me walk you through the first 3 days I&#x27;ve had with the 760CC.    Day 1  Bought the razor. Shaved 4 days growth, I went quick. Ended up with patch results. Where it was shaved it was fairly close but not as close as my razor. Very similar results to a quick shave with a razor after 4 days growth.    Day 2  Started on my face, focused on getting my face and jawline clean. Ended on my neck and didn&#x27;t do a very good job. Close shave on my face, but trouble spots on my neck remained. I have had to skip those spots in the past because using a razor can be very uncomfortable. After this shave, my face started to feel a little itchy, so I started using my moisturizing aftershave again.    Day 3  Started on the trouble spots on my neck. Moved the razor head more slowly than what I have been in the previous days. Ended on my face, hitting the chin and jawline with the locked head. I think today&#x27;s shave may actually be closer than my Fusion, and very little irritation.     I would strongly recommend this razor to anyone that is thinking about switching to electric. I have tried foil, and rotary&#x27;s in the past with poor results, I was either too impatient when I was younger, or the razor&#x27;s were inferior.The auto cleaner on the razor is great for home use. It takes a while, it&#x27;s not quiet, but it cleans the razor and the razor always comes out dry, something that wasn&#x27;t true with other electrics I&#x27;ve tried.    For travel, you&#x27;re going to leave the auto cleaner behind, it doesn&#x27;t transport well because the liquid in it can easily spill. This isn&#x27;t a big problem, because you can clean the razor under the tap, and then just let the head dry out during the day. Alternatively you can brush it out with the provided brush, but why would you? The battery is said to give 50 minutes of use, which should equal about 10 days of shaving. I haven&#x27;t spent more than 5 minutes shaving in any of my shaves so far. I don&#x27;t plan to bring the cord with me on most trips because I mostly travel for 2-3 days.    In summary, this is an excellent shaver, and for my face it&#x27;s comparable to a good wet shave system. Unfortunately the price is high which means it will take a while to recoup your investment against your wet shaving system, even with the ridiculous price of blades.  For me it&#x27;s allowed me to shave every day without slicing up my face which is significant value add, and helps with offsetting the investment. Give yourself at least a few days to try out the shaver. I&#x27;m not sure if i believe it takes 3 weeks, but my shave has improved with every day of use. If you are thinking about switching to electric this is a great choice, buying the top of the line takes the guess work out of deciding if the problem is with electric&#x27;s in general or just the cheap one that you bought.</li>
    <li> For many years I used a Braun 7570 shaver and received a great shave from a superior product. Every year or two I would replace the foil and blades and the shaver would be like new. It is no secret that the Braun series of razors are superior in quality and results. After using many other electric shavers I had finally found one that actually shaved my face and neck cleanly and comfortably. Recently, I was forced to replace my shaver after using it for at least 8 years. This was not due to any failure by the shaver, but because of a fire. Enter the Braun series 7-760cc. I am amazed on every level by this product. The most important quality in a shaver is the ability to get a clean, close shave. The Braun 760cc is unmatched,period! I have a very heavy beard and a very soft face. This razor shaves my face with ZERO RAZOR BURN! It works so well that I felt I needed to add to over 100 reviews that were already available. That&#x27;s how good this razor is. I recently spent 2 weeks in India and I used this razor every day while I was there. It does not require a voltage converter or transformer to use it abroad, nor do you need to carry the cleaning base with you. Simply take the plug, and the razor which fits nicely in the attractive case that is provided with the shaver when you buy it. All you will need is the correct adapter to plug in to whatever outlet you have available, the built-in transformer will safely provide the correct voltage to charge your shaver. Having said this, I want to add that I did not charge this razor until my 15th day in India and that was simply so it would be fully charged when I returned home. That means the Braun shaver worked for 14 days without being charged once. When I am at home I use the cleaning base every day after I shave. The next morning, the razor is clean and fully charged. I have had this razor for a couple of months now (probably 3) and I have yet to replace the cleaning fluid. The indicator on the cleaning base has let me know by a yellow light that in the near future I will need to replace the cleaning solution, and there is another indicator that will tell me when this time finally arrives. The cleaning solution is easily picked up at Walmart or other department store. To wrap this up let me just say that I believe you will be very happy with this product and the use that you get from it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> great Razor and great price.</li>
    <li> Ordered on Sunday and arrived on Tuesday (2 days) with free super saver shipping. The shaver is a good quality unit, it doesnt feel like a plastic Taiwan made piece of junk and actually has some weight to it. I used it right out of the box after charging for about ten minutes and I was reluctant to decide if I made a poor decision on spending the money on this unit as it was a little rough being \\&quot;dry\\&quot; out of the box and didnt quite do the best job. However, I have faith in good engineering and quality products and coming from Germany I refused to believe that I just bought junk. So I thought about it for a minute and decided to run it through the cleaning station and then tried again, this time it was much smoother! The cleaning system really does clean and \\&quot;lubricate\\&quot; the shaver, you can tell the difference in the drag on your face and even just running your finger across the foil it has a nice glide to it. This shaver is extremely close to a razor shave and has met and exceeded my expectations with the exception that my neck is a little trickier to get to due to the grain running in a different directions. This will vary for most people though and should not scare you away from trying this shaver. For me it will be used on a regular basis to keep cleaned up during the week unless I have the time and need for a super clean razor shave. It isnt a perfect shave, but is very close and no electric shaver ever is perfect. The base station is plastic, not really cheap plastic, but still plastic. For the money (180$ +) I think it could use a little more thought and could be made a little heftier to accent the shaver, but it still works well and fulfills its purpose. The cleaning system is awesome! I ordered the 7 series partly because it offers heated drying after cleaning vs the lower models (5 and 3 series)only drip drying. I am glad I did and think it is well worth getting the cleaning system with heat drying. From what I hear the cleaning solution is about 5$ per container and sold in three packs for around 15$. I think the price is a little steep but the solution is worth it to keep the system in top shape for a comfortable shave. I am probably going to look for a bulk buying method online to avoid retail markups. So far im happy with my purchase and the thought of knowing it will save me money vs buying disposables and cut the time of shaving down considerably. Hopefully for the price it continues to be a quality product with many years of service ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros...&lt;br /&gt;1) Great quality&lt;br /&gt;2) Lots of features&lt;br /&gt;3) As close to a razor as can be&lt;br /&gt;4) Self cleaning, lubricating, and heated drying&lt;br /&gt;5) Save money in long run&lt;br /&gt;6) Made in Germany&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons...&lt;br /&gt;1) Price (High up front, but worth it in the long run)&lt;br /&gt;2) Base station a little cheap and neglected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave a three star rating for first impressions as I have not tested long enough to find or not find any flaws in it. And dont want to cheat anyone by giving it more.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Shaves close and smooth! Does not &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; as loudly as my older models. Stays charged a long time-- could not be happier! HIghly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun user for years. I always stuck with the 3 series, primarily due to the cheaper price. The series 3 shaved &amp;#34;above average&amp;#34; but it never felt as close as a razor. I splurged and purchased the 7 series. Wow! A MUCH closer shave. Also the self-cleaning system got the razor incredibly clean. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have to shave every morning, like most men, but I must say this is one of the best, no the best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I previously owned a Braun electric shaver it worked OK for a while but it took longer and longer to complete a shave, over 20 and sometimes 30 minutes to get a good close ahave. I went back to manual shaving but wasn&#x27;t satisfied. I took a chance on the new Braun about a month ago because of the return policy. So far I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> After owning many electric razors in my life, this is by far the best for a close shave. Although it is more expensive, I believe in the long run, it will certainly be worth the additional cost.</li>
    <li> I have used nothing but an electric razor including several Braun razors and none have given me a shave like the 760cc I just purchased. I got the closes shave any razor has ever given me including the former 3 Braun razors I have owned. I thought the price was high when I was looking for new razor,but once I recieved and started using the 760cc I had to admit it was well worth the price. I am 88 years old an probably will never buy another razor, but if I do, You can bet it will be a braun.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco, Remington and the Braun series 5 shavers, Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic is by far the best shaver providing the closest and most comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> I should have bought this thing years ago.  Recently scoured reviews, then bought one.  Seriously, as close as a blade.  I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s so impressive that I actually look forward to shaving in the morning!  I&#x27;ve always shaved AFTER my shower whether using a blade or electric.  Braun recommends shaving BEFORE you wash.  I can say from experience that I don&#x27;t think it matters, this shaver could not possibly get any closer.  Maybe they expect less possible irritation if you shave BEFORE you wash, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of the shave AFTER my shower.  Just make sure your skin is dry.  Every morning I have a shaver ready that is fully-charged, cleaned, lubricated, and even has a hint of lemon smell in the shaver head! Spend the extra money and buy this Mercedes of shavers...it may be the last shaver you&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
    <li> I believe that everyone has a different type of facial growth.  Because of this I can only give an opinion for my face.  I have a face with scattered growth.  My chin is probably the only place I have dense growth.  I have been shaving for over 30 years.  I started with a blade.  I usually had irritation and bloody spots on my neck.  I then started using a norelco. It was okay.  Last December I bought this razor and was amazed.  It cut as close as a razor on my face.  I did have to really put some effort into it and push hard for my neck, but I also had to do that with my norelco.  The result left me with a razor smooth face.  Again, this is for my type of face.  I have had no problems with the razor and I believe it is very easy to keep clean.  I do enjoy having the cleaner.  My face gives it five stars.</li>
    <li> First of all, no electric razor is ever going to give me as close of a shave as I can get with a blade.  I decided to purchase an electric razor for economic reasons.  Yes, I think I can spend less money by buying an electric for $200 and using it for six years than I spend buying refillable razor cartridges.  Those blades only last me, at most, 10 days, and they are extremely expensive.  So I bought the latest and greatest Braun hoping for good things.  It has been about 15 years since I had used an electric razor.  I figured that the technology would have advanced a lot since then given how much technology has advanced with the standard blade.  I guess I was mistaken.  I even spent the extra money to get a high end model with the hopes that it would yield better results.  I&#x27;d be lying if I said I wasn&#x27;t a bit disappointed.  First and foremost, shaving with a blade is faster.  I have to go over my whiskers several times in order to get a decent result.  To achieve a good, close shave, I have to spend ten minutes with the electric, and I keep a goat-tee.  If I had to shave the mustache and goat-tee area, I suspect it would take me more than twenty minutes to do a good job.  Now there are some positives.  For one thing, the shave that I get with this razor is comfortable.  I also love the self cleaning system.  That was always one of my big hangups with electrics in the past.  I hated cleaning them.  But I think that the greatest advantage of all is that it is economical.  If I figure that I spent $200 on this razor along with $4 every six weeks to buy a new cleaning solution and $30 every 18 months, I will have spent about $320 after six years when the Braun company says I will have to replace it.  This is compared to spending between $100 and $150 a year on refillable cartridges using my old Gillette Fusion.  I think that the choice is obvious.  Gillette Fusion gives a much closer shave, but it costs about twice as much.  UPDATE:  I&#x27;m updating my review a few daysafter writing the original to relay that I have discovered the wonders of a pre-shave treatment option that has miraculously turned this shaver into something that actually works.  Now I still don&#x27;t think it shaves as good as a blade, but I think I can give it at least four stars.  I found a pre-shave oil at Wal-Mart that costs about $3, so I used that this morning.  The effect was a really clean shave with about half as much work.  The problem is, I don&#x27;t like my skin feeling oily.  So I ordered another product off of Amazon that isn&#x27;t an oil so I have a couple of options before I decide what I like the best.  They also sell some powders as well.  My advice is, if you shave with an electric, check out some of these products.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my husband and he he likes it. The holder does take up some space in our bathroom cabinet so I had to do some rearranging. You need space for it when it is cleaning. But that is our problem since we do not have a bathroom counter around the sink area. Other wise I would recomend it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t miss my \\&quot;IMPORTANT\\&quot; note below....but first my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this is the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used. I loved my 8985.  I&#x27;d give this 7-760cc zero stars if Amazon allowed it.  I may just go ahead and pay (a lot) to have my old one repaired since this new model is so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes it so bad?  Well, it doesn&#x27;t work worth a darn.  First of all, it feels more like you&#x27;re trying to remove your beard using an electric sander...but one with so fine of sand paper that it doesn&#x27;t take off the beard, but still irritates your skin.  I suspect the problem is that the holes in the screen are noticeably smaller than previously, and my hairs simply don&#x27;t fit through them well enough to get cut.  Because the head is a new design, I can&#x27;t try my old screen to see if that is the cause.  (I believe the series 5 is still interchangeable w/ my 8985, so I may try a new series 5 before I give up and get my 8985 repaired.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[[**UPDATE 18-August-2013: The issue isn&#x27;t the size of the holes; it&#x27;s the cutter, which they&#x27;ve changed slightly.  I just bought a 550cc locally, which uses the same cutter &amp; screen as my beloved 8985.  The 550cc was as bad as the 760cc, though not as uncomfortable.  I then swapped the screen from my 8985.  No change.  I then swapped the cutter from my 8985 and it worked great.  I also tried the reverse -- putting the new cutter &amp; screen on my 8985, and it sucked.  So, I think I MIGHT keep the 550cc, but I need to see if I can find some of the older designed cutters anywhere.  If I&#x27;m stuck with the new ones, which have thicker \\&quot;blades\\&quot; with less space between them, I might as well return my 550cc and stick with my el-cheapo Remington. (end of 8/18 update)]]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give an example, I tried shaving my face as best as possible with the new razor -- taking TWICE as long as normal, causing some irritation, and leaving a far from smooth result.  I then tried my 8985, which still limps along (motor seems to be failing -- inconsistent speed) and hasn&#x27;t had a new cutter in about a year.  Besides feeling so much more comfortable (almost soothing in comparison), it easily took off the rest of the beard.  When I emptied the two razors into the sink, it was clear that the new one removed less hair than my old one did, going over my face after using the new one.  THAT&#x27;s pretty darn bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I have an old Remington that I paid $25 for about 5 years ago when I went out of town and forgot my Braun, and that $25 Remington, which is nothing great, does a much better job than this $160 Braun.  In fact, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using until I either find a new Braun I like or I get my 8985 repaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT: If you decide to try it regardless of my opinion above, unless you are 100% positive you will be keeping this razor, pay attention to the fine print below the item (which I didn&#x27;t see initially) -- IT IS NOT RETURNABLE TO AMAZON! See below chat:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are now connected to Narender from Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:Why can&#x27;t I return my razor?!?! When purchasing, there was no mention of it not being returnable, PLUS, Braun has 60day money back satisfaction guarantee. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narender:Hello, my name is Narender. I will be happy to assist you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:Clearly, if Braun allows trying for 60 days, they don&#x27;t expect the cleaner returned, and although I didn&#x27;t open the cleaner that came with it, I can simply not include it if that is the issue w/ returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narender:Let me connect you to a member of our Hard lines team. It will only take a moment.&lt;br /&gt;A Customer Service Associate will be with you in a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are now connected to Sammie G from Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:Are you able to see what I previously typed to the other agent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammie G:Yes, please give me a moment to go over the notes.&lt;br /&gt;I understand you would like to return the Braun Series, but it is nonreturnable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m truly sorry about this, what is the reason for the return?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:Why isn&#x27;t that stated when purchasing? And that goes against Braun&#x27;s stated satisfaction guarantee that allows 60days to try it. I want to return it because it sucks. Worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammie G:It is stated on the detail page below the instock and details information. it states \\&quot;Special Shipping Information: This item is non-returnable and is not available for 2-day shipping due to additional shipping requirements. See details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:Why can&#x27;t I return it without the cleaning fluid? It&#x27;s not flammable without it, and Braun clearly doesn&#x27;t expect that back if they allow you to try it for 60 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammie G:It does have a 60 day satisfactory guarantee with Brauns. you will need to contact Brauns I can certainly provide you with there contact information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:Their.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammie G:Sorry, Their contact information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:Please do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammie G:One moment I&#x27;m pulling up their info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:I guess from now on I&#x27;ll purchase my razors from Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammie G:Braun/Gillette Phone: 800-272-8611&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammie G:You&#x27;re welcome Frank! Is there anything else I may assist you with today.&lt;br /&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:No. That is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sammie G:You have good day! We look forward to seeing you again soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDITION 8/12/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Braun, and on top of having to pay for shipping and insurance in order to return it to them for a refund, they said it could take up to 10 WEEKS to get the refund.  I&#x27;m not a happy camper.  Anyhow, in case it helps anyone else, here are BRAUN&#x27;s instructions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return razor, postage-paid, insured, with all packaging &amp; parts EXCEPT the cleaning solution, and include the receipt showing price and date purchased, plus your name and address, and send it to:&lt;br /&gt;  Returns Processing Center&lt;br /&gt;  4608 Appliance Drive&lt;br /&gt;  Suite 2&lt;br /&gt;  Attention: Braun 60day MBG&lt;br /&gt;  Belcamp, MD  21017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see why AMAZON can&#x27;t do the same thing: allow the item to be returned, less the cleaning solution (which is the core of the issue since it&#x27;s flammable).</li>
    <li> My husband had old Series 5 for 5 years!! and finally gave up. So, I decided to purchase this one for him and HE LOVES IT!! He was not serious about the new ones but after start shaving .... OMG, it is so quiet and now he can shave it in the morning without wake me up with the noise.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought it would be. Side burn cutter is very awkward to use and not long enough. I end up using old razor. Would think twice before buying.</li>
    <li> Bought razor for my Dad and it works great. Rotary blades weren&#x27;t doing the job well but these foils do.</li>
    <li> Had one in the past which was purchased overseas. Although I like this shaver, there are some things which are not the same even though it is the same model. In particular, the internal parts which vibrate the shaver heads are now made of plastic instead of the metal alloy as in the previous one. I wonder if it will hold up? I don&#x27;t use the cleaning station, to me not necessary. As long as you are diligent and clean it thoroughly after each use it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great shaver.</li>
    <li> There are only three reasons to buy an electric razor: save on blades, save time from buying blades or to avoid getting cut while shaving.  Other than that blades, or manual shaving are superior--no one would argue that you can get as close as shave with an electric.  The only thing they might say is \\&quot;it is close to a blade.\\&quot;    With that said, I ordered the Braun 790.  The thing has a whole lot of items to it and things you must buy to keep it going.  Unlike the Braun of old when it actually was a German company which specialized in practicality and didn&#x27;t try to milk customers into buying unnecessary things, Proctor &amp; Gamble (the maker of Tide and Crest) bought them out and changed the game.  Now you need to have this nasty alcohol solution cleaner--which must be repurchased every thirty days--in order to use your shaver.  In the past Braun was designed to be cleaned with water and a brush.  Furthermore, you need to replace the cutting block every year and a half for about forty bucks.  So any money you might have saved by not having to buy blades is eaten up by Proctor &amp; Gamble&#x27;s desire to milk as much money as it can from you!    Within a year and a half you will have spent nearly $400 to buy and maintain this razor--which will never shave as close as a blade and takes twice as long to shave as a blade.  And unlike Panasonic which allows for shaving under water, Braun must be used dry which reduces lubrication and the closeness of the shave.  All in all a raw deal, and therefore I am returning my Braun and realize the only thing this razor will help you get rid of is a lot of your money!</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband as a gift, was his first electric shaver and he loves it. Only has to shave a few times a week and he no longer nicks and cuts himself. He says it&#x27;s quiet and cleans easily</li>
    <li> Excellent close and comfortable shave without the annoying rash I used to get with other electrics. Charges quickly and maintains a charge well. The Pulsonic Clean and Charge Base charges and reconditions the shaver well but I was dismayed to learn that the Clean and Renew Cartridge is only good for 30 days before it should be replaced.</li>
    <li> I have used a razor for the last 20 years, at one point I purchased a cheap 15 electric razor and used it for two days before I threw it in the trash and went back to the razor.  I have a buddy who swears by this razor so I decided it was time to purchase a top notch one and give it one more go, boy I am glad I did!  This gets much closer then I ever thought a electric razor could get.  It does not get as close on the neck but it is close enough where I am more then happy with it.  When I used a razor I allways had a few small nicks but none at all with this razor and the lemon smell is great!  Makes me look forward to shaveing. I expected to have some discomfort fomr this razor since I have never really used a electric but have had none from day one. I have had this now for 6 months and will never go back to a razor.</li>
    <li> Really neat razor.  I purchased for my father.  He loves it \\&quot;say it gives him the best shave he has had in months -</li>
    <li> I like the razor.  I like the way it sits in the recharge base and has a cleaning solution to keep it clean.  Maybe I need to read the instructions, but it only tilts up and down.  If i can get it to tilt side to side, then I will like it better.</li>
    <li> Clean close shave. Quiet operation. All that you can ask for in an electric razor. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very poor shaving performance.Impossible to get a close shave, comparable to a razor ?Alcohol cartridge evaporates very fast.Not recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED BRAUN SHAVERS FOR MANY YEARS. WHEN I NEEDED A REPLACEMENT I ORDERED A NEW PULSONIC 7-760CC SHAVER FROM AMAZON.COM.  I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY &amp; PLEASED WITH THE NEW SHAVER. IT HAS SOME NEW FEATURES THAT MY OLD ONE DID NOT HAVE.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERY USER OF ELECTRIC SHAVERS &amp; PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERING CHANGING FROM MANUAL RAZORS. ALSO, THERE IS NO MESS TO CLEAN UP AFTER AN ELECTRIC SHAVE, SO ITS A TIME SAVER TOO.</li>
    <li> Works great had a series 3 for a while so was due for an upgrade and well it did not let this hairy person down.</li>
    <li> Shave my head and this electric does a good job.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I had a cheap Braun ($30) shaver for the last 2 years and I always had stubble and missed spots. This thing is great! Almost as close as my Monday Quattro shave (rest of the week electric in the car!) and no pinching or pulling. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for 2 years and an very pleased.  It is the best electric shaver I have used (and I have owned several over the years) and, therefore, is worth the premium price.  The Series 7 gives a close shave and the cleaning unit keeps it fresh.  I run it through a cleaning cycle once and week and remove and cap the cleaning fluid in between uses to make it last longer.  I replaced the blades and foil once so far, which was easy to do.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for over 20 years and every few a new design actually works substantially better than a prior design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such is the case with this unit....But I reserve the right to change my mind after a few more months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irritating:  The unit assumes the cleanliness of the shaving head apparently based on the number of uses rather than actual cleanliness.  I always dust the unit out after each shave so few, if any clippings remain, but based on the number of uses it adjusts the cleanliness rating.  Maybe this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue but the lower the rating the longer the cleaning cycle runs which exposes the cleaning fluid to more air and uses it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:  Shaver controls allow adjustment of the speed of the cutter heads.  Also the 3 heads move independently of each other as well as the entire head itself tilts to the angle of the face.  This results in a much better shave and collects almost all of my neck hairs that tend to lay almost completely flat against my skin.  Unit charges quite quickly and can be taken on trips without the base unit.  The base unit is slightly larger than palm sized but vertically it is quite tall and removing the shaver head requires additional clearance (12\\&quot; vertical space between shelves provides good access)  So plan on a tall shelf or find a spot to place it on the countertop.  The sideburn trimmer is deployed somewhat uniquely, use care as it doesn&#x27;t appear to be as sturdy as prior designs, but it does seem more suited to the task of trimming sideburns.  While charging the unit has LED&#x27;s galore blazing a trail, but thankfully the LEDs shut off 10 minutes after cleaning or charging so they thankfully are off at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall after a month it works well and I am pleased with the results.  Note that the 7 series and the 3/5 series units use different cutter technology so the 3 or 5 series may not deliver the same results.  Also, there are 7 series shavers that do not include the \\&quot;self cleaning\\&quot; base which may ultimately be a better option for many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my Braun now for 6 months and it has served me well over the months.  (increased rating to 5 stars) It continues to deliver a close shave.  Initially I had reservations about the \\&quot;self cleaning\\&quot; feature and cost of the unit but it does deliver a good consistent shave so it&#x27;s a good investment if you dislike using a regular blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1  DO NOT just stick the shaver with all the whiskers in the unit and expect it to clean well.  You will just clog the base and waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;#2 After shaving (every use) pop the cutter head off the base and tap in the sink and run water through it removing any loose hairs.  Gently shake off excess water.  replace head, and return to charger.&lt;br /&gt;#3 Every 2 or 3 days after doing this start the cleaning cycle this solution through the unit and drys it.  This is when you notice a refreshed closeness of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some additional comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A The unit has some alcohol based cleaner in the cartridge (smells like rubbing alcohol with some additives.  This naturally evaporates over time, but the little daily rinse adds a few stray drops to replenish back some of the liquid that evaporated.  Ultimately, I replaced the cartridge not because it was low but after 5 months it had accumulated a good bit of shavings (even with my daily rinse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B The shaver does have an adjustment for how close the shave will be.  START OFF with the least aggressive setting, or you may have a bit of rash from the shave.  Mine was minor for a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C Travel with the shaver by taking the power adapter without the cleaning base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D After market cartridges sold by different vendors are apparently \\&quot;gray market\\&quot; items.  The cleaning solution I bought at a national retailer has lasted just like the solution that came with the unit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice!&lt;br /&gt;My friend likes it very much.&lt;br /&gt;It can works very well and his jaw feels really good.</li>
    <li> Seems like if you don&#x27;t come at it a hundred times and from every possible angle you won&#x27;t have a good shave.  Shaving with a razor is easier but runs the risk of cutting oneself, this does not cut you but will pull hairs and will turn your skin red from inefficient shaving.</li>
    <li> A massive upgrade from my last shaver.  This one came highly recommended and has proven a good friend.  I don&#x27;t like the disposable culture and the disposable cartridges bother me.  I have a lot of trouble with that aspect of this shaver.  I suspect it isn&#x27;t really all that \\&quot;green\\&quot; and I&#x27;m trying to reduce my carbon footprint.</li>
    <li> Works great but i think is a bit expensive, my old braun is a cheapest model but do the same job.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!!</li>
    <li> Best electric razor on the market.  Cuts close and smooth and does not irritate your skin. No pre-shave ever needed.</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from a degenerative visual loss that was beginning to make using a blade-type razor hazardous; however he also has an extremely heavy beard.  The Braun 7 has provided the safety he needs and does an outstanding job giving him a close shave.  Totally satisfied with the product and Amazon&#x27;s usual rapid delivery.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is just a little awkward.Shaver grip and feel just not comfortable.I had a Panasonic before this one and it just conformed to your face well.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal customer to the Phillips Norelco for over twenty years. However, their quality has dropped over the years. So I switched to the Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver because of the good reviews.  It has performed great with a closer shave than I have experienced in the past With the Norelco shaving systems. The Cleaning system is top rate.  This is the best shaver I have had the pleasure to own.</li>
    <li> The product is very good! I use it every day and am VERY focused on QUALITY!!  The cleaning fluid and process works well, including the fresh cleaned scent of the razor. I would definitely buy another...but based on the quality I expect I won&#x27;t need to for many years.</li>
    <li> Excellent price for an excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is seriously the best razor I have ever had. It took me a while to become convinced enough to buy this expensive device. However, I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I have been using it for about two months and it&#x27;s honestly fixed every issue I have ever had with shaving. I have very sensitive skin, but this razor has a mode for that. This is simply worth every penny I spent on it. If you are considering this purchase, I recommend not waiting and just spending the money to buy it. You will not be dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my Panasonic ES8080 which dropped and broke.  The Braun 760cc is nothing special, doesn&#x27;t shave any closer or more comfortably than my ES8080.  Cleaning cartridge kind of gimmicky and you have to pay for replacement cartridges.  The angle that the razor sticks out of the holder is kind of dumb.  The worst thing about the razor is the trimming tool head is very close to the razor head when extended and you can&#x27;t trim your sideburns very easily without shaving your head.  The only good thing is the battery life seems very good compared to older rechargeable razors.</li>
    <li> The shaver works very well.  It would appear that the charging station recommends a complete cleaning far to often. It cleans very well with just running it under hot water.</li>
    <li> Excellent close shave. 7 series made in germany and u can easily tell the difference. Worth the investment. I hope I will be able to purchase a replacement foil n cutter when time come.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son and his impressions follow.  In short, this is the best electric shaver ever!  There is not a single feature of this product I would change; Braun hit it out the ballpark on this one.  The shaver is powerful and makes quick work of my beard, even if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days.  It gives a close shave without any razor burn or discomfort; something my old Phillips shaver could not provide.  In my opinion, the only thing that will shave closer is a straight edge razor; something I&#x27;m not daring enough to attempt.  I am able to shave without first using an electric pre-shave lotion on my face; another thing my Phillips could not do, as it would pull some whiskers or badly irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Braun is used in conjunction with an electric pre-shave lotion, the results are identical as if I had shaved with a traditional foam and multi-bladed razor.  The cleaning system is fantastic!  This is the only shaver system that uses an alcohol-based cleaning solution that leaves the shaver out-of-the-box new with a fresh lemon scent every time.  Another great feature is that the cleaning solution is self-contained, so once it is used up you can empty the container and recycle it (or just throw it away if you cannot empty the contents).  Although the cleaning solution replacements are more expensive than my old shaver, they provide much greater performance.  I purchased two replacement cleaning solutions at a local big box store for $12 and each one lasts approximately 2 months.  I do not seem to have the issue with rapid evaporation of the cleaning solution as other users have reported.  I live in a sub-tropic climate and the higher humidity probably inhibits the rapid depletion of cleaning solution others have noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most other shavers, this one can be charged without the cleaning base, as there is a port on the shaver itself in which to plug it.  I&#x27;m never on a trip long enough to need to recharge the shaver before I get home (I&#x27;ve used it 5 days in a row without charging and it displayed 40% charge remaining) but, it is nice to know that it is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great travel feature is the sturdy case that is included.  My old shaver came with a flimsy fabric sleeve that offered zero protection.  Braun provides a rubberized, hard plastic case that will help prevent any damage to the shaver by even the roughest of luggage handlers.  The only drawback to this product is the price; it is 2-3 times the price of competing units.  However, this high price is easily justified as Braun has made a product far superior to any other shaver on the market.get home (I&#x27;ve used it 5 days in a row without charging and it displayed 40% charge remaining) but, it is nice to know that it is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great travel feature is the sturdy case that is included.

    <li> Very nice product.  Braun has always been a top choice for this family.  The whole family has a Braun product and will always look to Braun for reliable products.</li>
    <li> I replaced an old Norelco with this as I was in bad need of a new one and the price was very good for the kit.  I&#x27;ve very happy and would definitely buy this again and would recommend the Braun shavers to others.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003YJAZZE Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver]]    My father used Remington shavers all his life. I have used Remington Electric shavers all my life.  I can&#x27;t do the shaving lotion/non electric blade approach because it is too tough on my skin.  The Remington shaver performs as advertised -- a good shave at a value cost.  However, after shaving with that brand for 35 years, I asked myself -- Can I get a better/closer electric shaving experience?  I read the reviews of the Braun shavers and decided to spend the additional money over the Remington to buy a Series 7-760cc Pulsonic.  I can honestly say, the additional money is worth it!  The shave is incredible.  The incremental cost/day for this shaver is well worth the final cut.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver, but it does not seem to be an improvement over my old Braun 5520 whose battery died this year and cannot be used even plugged in.  I prefer the old sideburn trimmer of the 5520 over the 760cc which is curved instead of flat like the 5520&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve tried Remington and other electric razors, but I think the Braun&#x27;s are smoother and better built.</li>
    <li> This was purchased after careful trials.  My husband had tried the 500 series before, but the razor was not powerful enough.  For the extra money the 7-760cc is well worth it.  We have two of these in the house.  The first was bought for my husband.  The second for my son this Christmas.  Would only purchase the 700 series!  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money or any lower series.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has always been a razor and shaving cream user, until he met me and my sensitive face.  For as long as I can remember, my dad has always used Braun electric razors, so I knew I had to get a Braun for their dependability.  Boyfriend could only shave his face about every 2 or 3 days due to ingrown hairs and razor burn.  I decided to do as much research as possible on the newest Braun electric razors.  This works like a charm in getting rid of all the stubble and keeping his face clear of razor burn and ingrown hairs, I can even brush up against his face without getting a rash.  This was not only a present for him but a present for me as well!  WARNING...if your bathroom is close to your bedroom don&#x27;t put the razor into be cleaning base before bedtime; it can be quite loud depending on which cleaning cycle the base choses to use.</li>
    <li> First time I used it the shaver-head lock button malfunctioned.  I sent it in for repair, it came back, and on the fourth shave the lock button jammed again.  I am waiting for a refund which I hope will include the $36 shipping and insurance expense I incurred as a result of their failure to deliver a fully functional product.</li>
    <li> Revision.  Close, great working shaver. But: we&#x27;ve had two charging stations fail. Now Braun is part of mega corporation Proctor and Gamble, as in Customer NO service and that&#x27;s what you get if you try to get help. They purposely make it so hard that you tire and throw in the towel. There are closer shavers out there i.e. some of the higher line Remington, and especially higher line Panasonic. The 7 series is perhaps Braun&#x27;s best shavers but they were German made and of high quality. We don&#x27;t expect that to last with the new non responsive customer relations. We&#x27;re told the 9 series is worse as they don&#x27;t provide a close shave as that of the 7. Why pay that much for a shaver and cleaner when you can buy something better for comparable pricing?  Bottom line: Not recommended.enty long, both good attributes. Good ergo, fit and operation. This is a good upper line shaver. Is it worth the big buck outlay? You&#x27;ll have to decide. Sale pricing is a good incentive when available. Amazon pricing is very hard to beat and they have sale prices all the time so it never hurts to wait if you&#x27;re not in a hurry. If you are, you won&#x27;t get burned by the normal prices.      Pros: Close shave, quiet, very comfy.   Cons: Foil/Cutter assembly can not be easily cleaned and should not be separated.     Bottom line: Great overall performance, worth the money if on sale, One of their best shavers.     Disclaimer: This review is written for information purposes only. It is not a venue for debate.

    <li> Talk about a close shave! This razor is comfortable in your hand and gives an incredible shave. Darn close to a blade shave. My only dig is that, like my last Braun shaver, it requires an expensive liquid filled maintenance accessory. The shaver is somewhat expensive but well worth the price. The cartridges on the other hand are pricy but a necessary evil. I wonder if you can refill them with distilled water and a drop of some unknown cleaning agent (dishwashing soap?).</li>
    <li> I have always used a Norelco and after receiving this shaver, I doubt I will ever go back.  It is the fastest and closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.  I would highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> Love that it gets a close shave, self cleaning, and that I&#x27;m able to take it to the field.</li>
    <li> After reading the wonderful reviews about this product I decided to give this shaver a shot. I have been looking for a product for a long time so that I could get rid of the blade, and start shaving more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium coarse hair, very sensitive acne prone skin and I have never used an electric shaver before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for the first time all I can say is WOW.  It didn&#x27;t feel like anything,  I almost feel like I&#x27;m cheating the system! I did have to trim my beard down to a 1 in order for it to work better.  I haven&#x27;t shaved in 2 weeks, so it isn&#x27;t a big deal (to me at least.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no knicks or cuts.  I didn&#x27;t feel any pulling at all.  The shave feels just as close as using a razor without the redness and irritation afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is semi-inconveniently placed, but if you know how to work a mirror it is no problem and definitely not game-breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base is great, it is not too loud like other reviewers stated.  It basically sounds like the shaver when it is on, which is not loud at all, and very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am never going back to a razor again after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies ( I didn&#x27;t forget about you! ) It makes a great gift and I would recommend this to anyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I regret is not paying for faster shipping, I could have been using this thing for that much longer.  Instead I had to wait a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Kenny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 9 months later:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a single problem. Still using the product still works great.  The cleaning system still works great and I love how easy it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as sharp as when it was new, starts to pull a tiny bit (cmon be a man) but I put some good use to it.  Probably have to buy a new head, but its no big deal because my face has been cut free for nine months and has helped my acne. I will continue to use the product.</li>
    <li> Shaver works well. Only 4 stars because of the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item from Amazon. It was pretty pricey, but I wanted something nice for my husband. Problem was, the base of the unit would not work. So I tried to return it to get another. Amazon said I could not return an item that could be flammable. They sent it to me! Now I&#x27;m out close to $200 and I don&#x27;t have a working shaver. Sad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a year and it&#x27;s been the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of using but the charging/cleaning station quit working.  The cleaning solution level was stuck on the middle and whenever I would try to clean my shaver it would just shutdown and a red light would start blinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried resetting the shaver, cleaning the charging/cleaning station thoroughly and it still did the same thing.  I got on Bruan and found the dealer to send it in for warranty and it was the Gourmet Depot, so I contacted them and they told me to just send the base station in, so sent it in and about A MONTH LATER I GOT IT BACK STILL DOING THE SAME EXACT THING!!!  I called the Gourmet Depot and told them that it is still doing the same thing and they told me to send it back, but with the shaver this time too!! WTF???  What kind of a warranty place is this??  Why didn&#x27;t they have me send the shaver in the first time??  This costs money!!  I live in the country and any shipping place is about 30 miles from my house!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bruan Warranty sucks because of who they choose to do repairs for them!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 3/11/14  As it turns out, there was a loose wire in the base unit and it is working great now!</li>
    <li> easy use and perfect quality..cleaning shaver.which i highly recommend.The shave is incredible.The incremental cost/day for this shaver is well worth the final cut.</li>
    <li> Well,it works amazing actually, however I got it over usd150,but it still looks a little &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;,it has modern look but not good enough，is it really a 7 series product？</li>
    <li> I had a Braun shaver for tem years before it died.  I loved it an decided to upgrade to the newer Braun and I am glad I did.  I have always had problems with hair on my neck and getting a really close shave.  The Braun 760 does great on both accounts and has been a great purchase.</li>
    <li> It is much cheaper than in China . And the power is very stronger than philip&#x27;s . Ever  I have bought a Philip&#x27;s electronic razor which did not work better than Braun&#x27;s . So I love braun .</li>
    <li> Well I have to say after being a\\&quot; blade shaver\\&quot; for so long I am pleased that this razor does as good a job as it does.I think its a bit pricey,but does shave well,I have used it with the same result from day to day shave,to three day stubble,this razor just mows it down without fail not lacking power no tugging or pulling,just a smooth clean shave. Altho the price is a bit steep you do get some bells and whistles ,if you like that sort of thing like when to clean and level of cleaner left ect....The trimmer takes some getting used to \\&quot;its tricky but workable\\&quot; So all in all I would say that this is a good product and I would recommend giving it a try</li>
    <li> I placed my order more than two weeks ago, this merchant changed the status to \\&quot;preparation\\&quot;, which prohibits you to cancel the order. But the status is still the same till now! I have sent several messages to this unprofessional merchant but NEVER GET A RESPONSE! I understand that they are busy because they do not have enough intelligence to finish their job on time. But at least they should reply the customer&#x27;s messages, right?</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun series 5645 electric shaver for the last 8 to 10 years. On a recent trip I lost the 110 V charging cord. Seeing that a replacement cord was almost as expensive as a new electric shaver, I ordered this product (Braun 7-7600cc Pulsonic) thinking it would be superior and top of the line. I am very disappointed in that it does not shave as close as my old series 5645 unit. I wish I would have bought a new electric cord even though the price for the cord is outrageous; at about $140.</li>
    <li> As I turned 50, the whole characteristics of my beard started changing substantially. I had used a rotating electric shaver my whole life, but that was not anymore delivering a perfect shave. Then I decide to look for a coil shaver and after reading some reviews I decided for the Braun Series 7-760. After 2 weeks of using it daily, I have to say that I am very pleased. I look perfectly shaved the whole day, even late in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a cleaning / charging cradle that to me is a little bit bulky. But other than that this is a solid product,  that feels very well in your hand and delivers to its promise. I do recommend it!</li>
    <li> Last razor used to cut my face up pretty good. Switched to this one and BOOM! no more looking like I literally got in a fight with a lawnmower. It works pretty well and Braun is as good company. No complaints so far</li>
    <li> Does a very good job.</li>
    <li> I must say this shaver is as good as people say. Close shave,Zero pulling and gentle on skin. Side burn trimmer is not great but I really didnt even want that anyway. I have been a safety  razor and Mach 3 guy for years. They do give a slightly better shave but the time and hassle you save using this machine makes it a no brainer. Awesome shaver....Spend the little extra,its worth it</li>
    <li> I get a close shave every time with a clean razor!  On atrip I can rinse it in the sink.</li>
    <li> Had the prior model and it worked great.  This is way over priced for the mediocre shave.  The shaver doesn&#x27;t sit it the cradle correctly a lot so a lot of fiddling to get it in right so you can run the cleaner.</li>
    <li> Have had the Braun razors for many ,many years and this model is the best yet!&lt;br /&gt;As the Company states, takes a few days for the face to be used to this razor, but well worthy the effort.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent battery life.</li>
    <li> A nice upgrade to the previous Braun razor my husband had.  Great close shave.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Cuts closer than my older Braun shaver I was replacing. Charge last about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this for about a half a year and my face still isn&#x27;t used to it and i don&#x27;t think it ever will be. if i don&#x27;t shave at least once a day, it feels like it is chewing and pulling instead of shaving no matter which setting i use. my old 5441 is still going strong with a comfortable shave even after 13+ years and producing a smoother, more consistent result - but it has become a hassle to find replacement blades. and the cleaning cycle of the 7-760 is ridiculously loud - it&#x27;s actually caused guests to become alarmed.</li>
    <li> Excellent close shave. The cleaner works very well. Well made shaver. The Best Braun shaver I have owned. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The shaver provides the closest shave of any of my other Brauns. Cleaning system is bulky. The travel case is made of cheap material and will subject shaver to damage as I travel.</li>
    <li> I have owner this shaver for almost 4 years.  It produces excellent shaves - equivalent to or better than a manual razor.  When I first used it, I got 6-8 shaves per charge.  Now I get 8-10 shaves per charge.  My practice is to use it until the battery dies, then charge it.  If I need to finish a shave, I plug it in for the last minute or two.  It takes me about 4-6 minutes per shave depending on my beard.  I used to manually shave a couple of times per year.  Now maybe once per year.  I use this shaver daily.  The cartridges last at least 18 months but I change it every 2 years.  I used the cleaning system only when the shaver has discharged, since it charges the razor as well.  Since I travel a lot, it sometimes get cleaned with water.&lt;br /&gt;The clean and renew system is expensive if you replace the cartridge when needed.  They do not last long - at first maybe 18 charges, the second cartridge only about 10 times.  I realized the cartridge appears to be alcohol and although not recommended (and could void a warranty), I refill the cartridge with 70% or 91% isopropyl alcohol available in a drug store for about $1 or $2 a bottle (you can many refills per bottle!).  Even though they last only about 8 cleans, it&#x27;s much (!!!) cheaper to refill.  The shaver cleans fine and I have never had a problem while doing this for the last 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;The only real problem I had was with the trimmer - which is not well designed.  After about 2 years, it got stuck and only partially closes.  I have to hold it down to shave.  The spring is not set right and I could not fix it.  After another year, a plastic piece broke off and it now doesn&#x27;t work at all - still have to hold it down to shave.  I am considering having it repaired, but cannot get an estimate without paying $35 for the repair company to look at it.  May purchase the new 790.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great shaver and if you can live with the trimmer issue, you&#x27;ll love it!!</li>
    <li> When buying shavers in the past, I had always wondered who would pay the high price for this shaver. After going through several cheaper shavers I finally decided to give this one a try. All I can say is this thing is incredible. I had no idea what a difference the high speed shavers can make. I cut my shaving time by at least half and it&#x27;s twice as smooth. I love the self cleaning and the 7 series drys as well. Always ready for the next time. Love it. If you think it&#x27;s to expensive, trust me, it isn&#x27;t. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several Norelco razors over the years, but this is hands down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever had. I have sensative skin, so I&#x27;ve always needed razors that will not shred my face up with razor burn. But generally you sacrifice a close shave for one that is easy on the skin. Not this one. I get a better shave than my last Norelco, which had a lotion to help with sensative skin. With the Norelco, I would have to wait for a few days of growth before I shaved, otherwise I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave. With this new Braun, I can shave every day and it&#x27;s a closer shave than I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on shavers. I have had two different styles and brands in the past. This is by far the best shaver I have ever used! Fast, no razor burn, easy to clean. Worth the money! I don&#x27;t think you really need the shaver system... The razor cleans really easy just running the blade head under water; and I don&#x27;t really notice a difference in the three different speeds.</li>
    <li> Works great. Was using a double edge before, electric razors always left my skin irritated, but not this one. Skin feels smooth after, with no cuts or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes sometime to get certain neck hairs though.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this daily and it self cleans really well, gets to all the spots and does a really close job very quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. It won&#x27;t give a close shave as a blade but is does a pretty good job. I used to shave once a week with a blade because of my sensitive skin. With this shaver I am able to shave twice and even three times a week. That is why is a superb buy. My skin does not even get red know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read from previous reviews that the cleaning cartigradge were a big expense. However, I got use to remove the thing after each cleaning and I still have the one that came with the machine. I looks that it is going to last a while still. So, if you want to sabe some money just remove it and insert it only when cleaning is necessary. Mine is 3 months old and still almost full.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected to find with a Braun product. This razor replaced an older Braun and this is much better than the older one.</li>
    <li> ordered it on 13th nov, received on 30th same month, today is 15th dec, I&#x27;m not a daily user (so i used it more less than 10 times) but until now i have \\&quot;only\\&quot; the head locking system broken, the blocking clip is moving lose from side to side. otherwise nice and clean shave, but try to shave your upper lip wit a wobbling shaving head. i am eager to see what flaw will occur next. hope to solve it in a way or another when i will come back to civilization, i don&#x27;t think that braun were so perspicacious to settle some representatives here in Afghanistan :D.</li>
    <li> I had an older model Braun and liked it. It was 9 years old and I thought I would treat myself to a new razor. To my surprise, this razor is truly much more than I expected. I get a close shave without burning my face. The technology of this razor is 100 times greater than my old one. I love it and highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good close shave. Also it is quiet and the head of the razor follows the contour of your face. Great job Braun.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have had in years. Cuts fast whithout having to keep going over the same area multiple times.</li>
    <li> It is very quiet compared to any other shavers I have owned, it is slick looking, it shaves as close as any other shaver I have had, but not as \\&quot;close as a blade\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Works great. Best electric shave that I ever had. Also like the auto cleaning feature. I recommend the shaver highly.</li>
    <li> Amazing razor (I&#x27;m coming from a 5 series) and I have no problems with it whatsoever. I love how I can clean with running water now as well (couldn&#x27;t with my 5 series). I would love to use it in the shower but I am getting conflicting information regarding this. Braun&#x27;s dedicated 7 series webpage states:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% waterproof and fully washable&lt;br /&gt;Braun shavers have a fully sealed body and can be rinsed quickly and easily under running water. For optimal convenience, you can use the Clean &amp; Renew™ system to clean your shaver at the touch of a button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, only the 790 model shows &amp;#34;wet/dry&amp;#34; shave in its features, while the 760 does not. So I e-mailed Braun support and got a response (below):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for contacting Braun, German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We appreciate your interest in the Braun shaver. I will be sharing your interest with the rest of my team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Series 7 shavers are fully sealed and waterproof for full washability, however the&lt;br /&gt;Series 799cc  is the Wet&amp;Dry model that can be used for a comfortable dry shave or a refreshing wet shave in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for writing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenesha G.&lt;br /&gt;Braun Team&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would think that if the 760 is fully sealed like the 790, then why NOT bring it into the shower considering it&#x27;s got the EXACT same head as the 790 series??  See my point?  Is Braun trying steer its customers to their more expensive 799 with it&#x27;s &amp;#34;exclusive wet/dry feature&amp;#34;?  Sounds fishy to me. So for now I will not bring it into the shower or let my wife try it on her legs in the shower. I will reply to support with my ongoing concern and post their response here as I&#x27;ve noticed there were many questions surrounding the 760&#x27;s waterproofness.</li>
    <li> Having owned a few low(er) end Braun shaver systems, I was a bit skeptical of the marketing claims of this unit.  Do not doubt the capability to get an extraordinary shave with this device.  It is BETTER than I could have hoped for, and I regret not pulling the trigger sooner on this shaver.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Great shave!  Comfortable to use -- no pulling hairs.  Nice design easy to hold. Long battery life.  Quick battery recharge.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Braun 8985 for the last several years and have replaced the cutter and foil at least once.  It was a good razor but I frequently felt a whisker get yanked several times during every shave.  That got better after a while, or I got used to it and knew how to hold the razor to minimize it.  I shaved with this razor (Series 7-760cc) one time and never felt one painful yank!  It was the smoothest and cleanest shave I ever had.  I would say I have a medium thickness beard, not very dense, but I have very sensitive skin.  This razor is not only powerful but quite gentle.  The angle of the shaver head makes it very comfortable in my hand.  I&#x27;m glad I decided to upgrade.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  I must admit that I have never used any electrics but Brauns my entire life, so I can&#x27;t compare it to the other brands.  But, this is my third Braun in 20 years, and the first two were quite good, so I stuck with them.  This one is just excellent.  Both of my previous ones gave good close shaves, but this one does just as good a job with practically no irritation at all.  I think it must be that the foil screens are spring-loaded.  When I am done shaving with this 760, my face feels so good (compared to before.  With my older Brauns, I used to have to put on aftershave to cool my skin off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never owned a shaver with a cleaning system before.  I really like it and I think it works pretty well.  I must reiterate someone else&#x27;s comments on how to prolong the life of the cleaning solution.  I only clean the shaver once per week in the system.  The other times, I just run the shaver under the faucet.  The morning after I use the cleaning system (about 24 hours after), I take the shaver out of the cradle, then open the cleaning system, carefully remove the cartridge, and put the plastic cover back on (make sure you don&#x27;t throw away the cover when you open it the first time).  Since it is alcohol-based, most of the reason it will get too low within a month is simply due to the solution evaporating.  You want to wait 24 hours after cleaning to do this because you want all the solution that was running through the system to dry out.  My current cartridge was opened in mid-June, and more than two months later, the light indicator is still showing that my solution level is full!  With this method, I can probably get a good 4-5 months out of one cartridge!</li>
    <li> Well-built - much better than my prior razor (Braun 3 Series).  Because of my prior experience, i wasn&#x27;t going to buy a Braun, but the reviews for this razor were overwhelmingly positive. I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased so far with it&#x27;s build quality and the smooth shave it delivers...</li>
    <li> Replaced my old series 5 when the mechanism finally wore out after 8 years of service. The 7 series gives a smooth comfortable shave. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have used two Philips Norelco shavers in the past with extreme disappointment. They never gave me a good shave at all and they never got to the tough areas. There were always spots which were missed and my shadow would start appearing before the sunset. So i swore off electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. I was never going to invest in another philips so I decided to try Braun. The stumbling block for me was the price. I live in Singapore and there prices here for most shavers are double if not more than in the US. I didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money at the risk of not being satisfied with the shave, hence I decided to ship one us from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a while.. as there was a snowstorm which delayed the delivery but thats unavoidable. Finally it arrived. Came all properly sealed up and the long trip didn&#x27;t do any damage at the packaging what so ever .. so thats a good start. It came in the original packing .. got it out quickly and charged it up. I did try to shave my chin for a start to see what it was like.. and the results looked promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next morning, after my shower, put my shaving gel on and starting at it. It seems to pick up everything .. might take a few passes but it seems like a good shave. It might not be as close as with a shaver, but its pretty darn close 2nd. I was impressed. Oh and what I have noticed is that I don&#x27;t have those really small knicks and skin irritation from using the normal shaver. I haven&#x27;t tried a dry shave and I don&#x27;t plan too as my skin gets irritated a lot from that. Through out the day I kept checking if any stubble had grown out indicating a poor shave but no, was still good. In the even before bed, did another check and i couldn&#x27;t tell the difference if i shaved in the morning from electric shaver or a manual one. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, just after 3 shaves.. I&#x27;m seriously impressed with the 760. Way beyond my wildest expectations. I&#x27;ll be travelling with it for the next couple ofdays to see how it performs. So far.. its brilliant! What a buy!</li>
    <li> Ok, I love this shaver!!!!!! 760cc. I was a Norelco user for  years but as it turns out, my neck is sensitive or has become sensitive with age. I had hated every shave on a Norelco in my later years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one product I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon, got it on Ebay, $119 with free shipping. It didn&#x27;t have the box but who needs it anyway. It was in perfect condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After tons of research, I decided on the 760, there are 3 things the 790 gives you for more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;790&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It has an LCD display giving you more info, mostly it&#x27;s cleaning needs and more bars for charge status. Well, what the heck do you need that for, the base tells you it&#x27;s clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The 760 is all black instead of the 790 gray shaver and a black base. Is this a fashion statement, I like it all black!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. A quick clean button. Unless you&#x27;re in a dormitory and it&#x27;s the community shaver (yuk), who needs it? You shave in the morning, rinse it under the tap and put it in the bath tub and mash the clean button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 760 has an LED display with 100%, 80, 60, 40, 20%. When you give it a bath, it&#x27;s always at 100%! And it doesn&#x27;t have the other 2 useless features of the 790&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for anyone looking at both the 790 (799, money&#x27;s no object) and the 760, the 760 is the better deal by far the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go 760CC!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  Close shave, easy to clean, did I mention really close shave.  He would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my first Braun shaver.  I love it&#x27;s close and comfortable shave.  It cleans easily and shaves a long time on a single charge. I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> Took me a while to convince myself to spend the money. Amazon had the best price, of course, and I haven&#x27;t looked back. It&#x27;s a whole new world of shaving. I switched from a blade, sure I need to shave every day now but it&#x27;s so easy that it&#x27;s less hassle than the blade every other day. Does a great job, cleans itself well, and the intensity levels are actually very helpful even though I didn&#x27;t really see the use in them at first.</li>
    <li> I just love this one, I was still in the old shaving time frame, where I was getting myself cut every single time I shave, and had problem to stop the bleeding since I am taking some blood thinner medication.&lt;br /&gt;Now, since I started using My new Braun shaver, not once did I have a cut and is very convenience to use.&lt;br /&gt;I use it without even looking in a mirror, and get the smooth shave I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this to all of my relatives and friends.&lt;br /&gt;and looking forward to the next upgrade when it is time for me to re-order</li>
    <li> My dad always used electric Norelco shavers. When it came time for me to get my first shaver, I went out to the store and bought a Remington foil shaver. It was awful, didn&#x27;t work well for me at all. My dad told me I should have bought a Norelco. So I went and bought one, it worked great compared to the Remington, and I turned in to a Norelco believer. Been using them for 15 years now, and for the most part have been very satisfied. The Norelco&#x27;s have always been very quick, quiet, and have done a passable job. I wouldn&#x27;t say the shaves were great, but decent enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until recently I was thinking about replacing the blades on mine, when I decided that I was curious what else was out there. My previous shaver was around $120, so definitely nice and above average, but not top-of-the-line. I decided I was going to splurge on a top-of-the-line electric shaver to see what it&#x27;s like. It came down to this vs one of the Norelco 3d models. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to try a foil shaver since my experience with the Remington was not ideal (though it was a cheapie and 15 years ago), but after doing some reading online, I decided to take a chance and try a different brand and different type of shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy am I glad I did. My very first shave with this thing and it is shocking to me how smooth my face is. Never, not even when they were brand new, did either of my Norelco&#x27;s shave this close. I genuinely can&#x27;t tell the difference between the shave I got from the Braun and what I would get from an actual razor. It&#x27;s really that good... I would argue that it&#x27;s actually better just because of the convenience factor. It also doesn&#x27;t struggle with hair on places like my neck, which the Norelco would take several passes to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess with electric shavers it is different strokes for different folks, I was a norelco rotary fan and thought I would be for life, but very glad I decided to try something new because it turns out it is significantly better than what I was used to, and quite frankly, I don&#x27;t see how it could get much better than this.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with Amazon service. I used braun product 20 years ago, and switched to Phillips. Generally satisfied  with 2 phillips product more than 10 years. Now just changed to braun again. It is better for me. Almost make you neck area as clean as razor.&lt;br /&gt;But, there was a defect, (lock button doesn&#x27;t lock the head, it is not a big deal, but I usually use shaver more than 5 years, so who knows? I may use it later, so I am returning this product), and overly I don&#x27;t know it is so well-built or poorly-built. When you hold it, it feels kind of cheap, even cheaper than 150$ panasonic which is my sons. BUT, most of all shaving result is guaranteed.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever owned. Self cleaning function keeps my laziness from damaging this investment. I have been using this for over 18 months with no problems what-so-ever.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my bf and he loves it. I love touching his face after he uses it..hehe. Reusable cartridges can get pricey tho.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for many years and I wouldn&#x27;t think of changing.  They are easy to use, clean and keep charged.</li>
    <li> I have not regretted purchasing this product; it is quite excellent in terms of fit and finish. I have owned the Braun series 7505 shaver for roughly 12 years and I am accustomed to the reputable quality of Braun shavers. This was an easy purchase that didn&#x27;t leave me with any regrets: the overall ergonomic design is designed for easy handling and doesn&#x27;t produce any strain like the 7505 model. Additionally, I prefer the design of foil design as compared to the rotary type blades featured by Norelco products. These provide a more close and adaptive shave. I also appreciate the new design of the shaving head block: the razor detaches from the mounting system enabling ease of cleanup. The shaver comes with a cleaning/charging stand that provides a nice cleanup. As this is a Braun shaver the head can be detached for cheaper cleaning under the faucet. There is a nice led display that features the overall charge available.&lt;br /&gt;  My criticisms are slight, but noteworthy: (1) cleaning pods are expensive, (2) the company is hard to contact regarding technical issues and repair opportunities. The cleaning pods need to be replaced and purchased from other vendors, there is no discount option for buyers. The company has reduced it&#x27;s dealer repair network forcing one to contact their head facility in Boston, if you happen to live on the East Coast. Overall good shaver with minor concerns.</li>
    <li> I thought my previous Braun shaver (5 series) gave a pretty close shave but when this one arrived I did an A/B comparison and the new model definitely got the wife&#x27;s seal of approval. I don&#x27;t know what goes on inside this strange-looking cleaning and lubricating device but it seems to work pretty well. It also smells good, like an old-time barber shop. A small point but one that show&#x27;s Braun&#x27;s attention to detail. The brand name inspires confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the closest electric shave I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I love the razor. The cleaning station is something that I will not use and don&#x27;t need. Over the top and who wants to replace the solution?</li>
    <li> I never knew how bad all of my previous cheap razors were until I bought this one.  The charge indicator is a nice touch.  It&#x27;s unusually quiet for a foil style shaver, by far the most quiet of any that I&#x27;ve ever used by a wide margin.  I&#x27;m not a fan of rotary style shavers, get&#x27;s closer than those I have used.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t get quite as close as some of the Remington micro foils that I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I never quite get the same results from Braun that I have from Remington.  Now I know, even Braun&#x27;s top of the line doesn&#x27;t get that there.  However, I&#x27;m willing to look past that for all of the great features and performance of this model.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Braun shaver in about 15 years. Been using this one for 10 months. It&#x27;s both good and bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Very close shave. Easy does it or it can cause razor burn, especially on high setting.&lt;br /&gt;* Three speed settings are a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;* Very quiet out of the box. (beware, read my cons)&lt;br /&gt;* Operates while charging, unlike Braun&#x27;s wet/dry versions that only operate unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Center scissor blade badly pulls mustache, beard, and sideburn hair. It hurts a lot!&lt;br /&gt;* Hair trimmer is weak and awkward. The older style trimmer (as on Series 3) is much better.&lt;br /&gt;* After 10 months of light use, the center scissor blade is extremely loud, enough for ear plugs on the highest speed. Locking the pivoting head quiets it down but negates a major design feature of the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;* The foil/cutter head is rated for 18 months. Mine was overdue for replacement after nine months. I easily got 18-24 months on my previous Brauns. I assume the problem is cost cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on the fence about this shaver. I might buy a replacement foil/cutter. Then again, I might apply the money towards a new shaver from a different manufacturer. I think I&#x27;m done with Braun for what they cost since most are made in China now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a replacement foil/cutter head for the shaver that says Made in Germany. The new head looks about the same but weighs noticeably less than the original. The original is clean, by the way. The shaver is still very loud to the point of needing ear plugs. When the head is removed and the motor is turned on, it seems that motor assembly has probably gone bad (excessive vibration). There&#x27;s no place anywhere around the MD/D.C. metro area for warranty support, with Braun&#x27;s website showing the closest place about 400 miles away in Massachusetts. I&#x27;ll contact Braun and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I suggest taking reviews here with a grain of saltunless the reviewer makes it clear that the shaver has been in use for at least six to nine months. That&#x27;s about how long mine lasted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been happier with the shaver its the best one I&#x27;ve ever bought. I would recommend this product to anybody give the closest shave of all the razors I&#x27;ve ever used plus the beard trimmer is a plus the battery indicator on the bottom is a plus and the cleaning solution keeps it working perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver.  I am an observant Jew, and we cannot use a razor blade on our face.  Therefore, I have had many shavers over the years and this Braun Series 7-760 shaver is the best I have ever owned.  It gives a comfortable, close shave which lasts all day long.  This, I attribute to the foil head; I prefer the foil head over the rotary heads.  I also appreciate the fact that it has a cleaning/disinfectant cycle.  That is a great feature in itself, and it works well.  GREAT SHAVER - GREAT PRICE!!!  I am not in the least bit disappointed in this shaver.</li>
    <li> The shaver does not shave as closely as a decent razor.  You have to go over the same area more than once, but not excessively, like some other electric shavers.  It gets most hairs, but does not shave them extremely close.  It is obviously not a razor close shave, but it is very good for a lazy quick shave or as a touch-up shave for the next few days after a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone who does not need a razor close shave every day, or for someone whose face gets too irritated by shaving with a razor every day.  It has multiple speed settings on it, but I always keep it on the highest setting because lowering it doesn&#x27;t seem to be of any benefit and I have no discomfort from the highest setting.  The trimmer that comes with it is excellent for sideburns or mustache or beard EDGING, but is difficult to use for trimming a week&#x27;s worth of growth before a full shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is not overly loud, but it is also far from quiet.  The self clean function gets it quite clean, but after you start it, it has to finish the cycle and drip fully dry before you use it again.  If you don&#x27;t let it completely dry, the cleaning solution that is left on the shaver can burn your face.  One benefit of this shaver it is you can use it while it is plugged in, so if you forget to charge it, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
    <li> Husband:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I prefer it over my old Braun. The cleaning is good.&amp;#34;......&lt;br /&gt;My thought: it sounds loud when it is cleans itself. The appearance is sick. My husband face is smooth and it makes me want to kiss him all day.</li>
    <li> I received one for christmas last year. Loved it so much, I bought my scruffy brother inlaw one this year. Easy to clean and shaves great.</li>
    <li> My dad commented that he really enjoyed his new shaver. Specifically, he liked that he only needed to shave an area once and it was clean. He also noticed that he didn&#x27;t have much growth at the end of the day. My husband has owned Braun Shavers exclusively and wouldn&#x27;t consider ever using another brand. The German quality can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  We had one previously and wore it out.  self cleaning is nice.  you have to purchase the cleaning kits about every six months. You can buy new blades for it also.  Product will last long time.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my 7 series Braun. It gives a very close shave and I like the cleaner. I have only had the razor for about a month, but I am convinced I made the right choice .</li>
    <li> Love it - works great. I came from shaving with a disposal razor to this! Really good price too.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased it because a friend really liked it</li>
    <li> Braun is the best brand electric razor and this is their best product.  VERY comfortable shave and the cleaning system is simple and complete.  The only thing to be prepared for is the replacement cost of the cleaning solution.  I&#x27;m sure most of the cost is the container that is disposable, I haven&#x27;t tried changing the solution, but will probably give that a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my last Braun Series 3 died, after 5 Years of use and boy what an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I did a lot of research, I really wanted to go with a Norelco but I believe I made the right choice for my skin type.  Given that Braun is a foil shaver, I believe they are the best shavers for people with very sensitive skin. I hate, hate, HATE shaving with a razor because it leaves my skin feeling raw and itchy and it&#x27;s terrible. After 5 years of using my last Braun it broke. It was sudden and random, but I figured spending $120 (with 2 foil replacements) over 5 years wasn&#x27;t too bad of an investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver feels AMAZING! it cuts so smoothly, it doesn&#x27;t catch and pull on hairs.  it just mows over them and you don&#x27;t feel anything.  afterwards my skin feels just fine and there&#x27;s no raw itchy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shaver, I hope it stands the test of time.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used. It gives the closest shave of any electric shaver I have owned. On top of that, it cleans/sharpens/charges itself. I have a feeling i will have this razor for years more</li>
    <li> Works great!  Very pleased.  Excellent shave.  Like how you can adjust the closeness of shave.  Easy grip style with rotating head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Braun fan and this is almost the best one I&#x27;ve ever bought.  The only draw back is that the beard trimmer is very cheaply made.  But it&#x27;s super quiet and gives me the best shave.</li>
    <li> I found this particular model of electric shaver rated very highly in several different consumer research websites.  When I compared to prices in stores and online, Amazon by far had the best price with Super Saver Shipping.  I saved over $100 when compared to some of the prices I found I eBay.  Its a great razor for me since I could shave twice a day.  The cleaning/recharge base is awesome.  Refills of the solution aren&#x27;t too expensive.  I bought a 3 pack for around $18 from Target.  Its the closest to a straight razor shave that I&#x27;ve ever had in over 25 years of shaving.</li>
    <li> Best Braun shaver so far. I have been buying Braun for years but this one gives me the closest shave yet.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Remington shaver for many years and shaving once a week with a blade. The Braun shaves as close as the blade. No more blade for me. I also like the self-cleaning feature.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver a little less than a year and the plastic has started to break down near the cutter head. Not sure, but it could be due to the cleaning fluid or heater used to dry the shaver. It&#x27;s too bad because it is one of the the best shavers I have owned. I am going to have to send it in for repair. I posted a photo in the \\&quot;Product Images from Customers\\&quot; section. See right side of browser window in customer reviews section.</li>
    <li> I love the shaver . It is incredibly smooth and efficient. It seems very solid and durable.  I think the cleaning system that doubles the price is a big waste of time and requires refills. get the same shaver without the cleaning mechanism.</li>
    <li> This 7-760cc is even smoother and more powerful than my old series 5 which I thought was great.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband.</li>
    <li> The shave is not as close as I would like.  Overall, it is acceptable.</li>
    <li> I gave up on electric razors decades ago. I purchased various brands, but until I used the Braun 760cc I never thought they could reach the shaving smoothness provided by a blade. The Braun doesn&#x27;t pinch, cut, or irritate my face as the electrics I remembered, and the cleaning system eliminates a tedious burden of daily cleaning.</li>
    <li> It works well but I&#x27;m not sure I like it more that my standard Braun shaver. Plus the cleaning station does not have a drying mode. Not good.</li>
    <li> Does not shave nearly as good as advertised</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything was going to be better when my Norelco shaver which gave me a very good shave. I was wrong. This shaver is just about as good as a blade, maybe the same, without all the fuss and was even better than the Norelco. I like the idea that it cleans itself so I do not have to bother. Once set up, after shaving you just put it back in the cleaner holder. The holder tells you how much cleaning will be necessary and the amount of cleaning fluid is left. Then you just push a button.The directions said that if you were changing from a rotary shaver it may take two weeks to see perfect results. Actually, it took less time. The shaver is fast and you can even adjust the intensity of the shavers cutting action. Yes, it is somewhat pricy and getting refills for the cleaner adds to the costs, but you use it almost every day and I find it well worth the extra costs.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric shaver I have ever used.  Am very pleased.  Took little time to get skin accustomed to electric vs conventional. Braun 7-760cc.</li>
    <li> After years of using another brand of electric razor, I switched to this model about a month ago. The difference is remarkable. The shave is closer and the unit is quieter. And the cleaning system actually works! I&#x27;d thrown away the one from my previous model because it did nothing and I ended up cleaning manually anyway. Finally, the battery is outstanding. I&#x27;ve gone four days without a charge and it still shows above 80%.</li>
    <li> Reviews I had read had some dubious remarks, however I proceeded with the purchase.  For me the shaver has exceeded my expectations.  Unit has 3 settings of shave closeness and I selected the least closest... it shaves closer than my previous Braun without any skin burn.  Charging and cleaning systems work fine.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Great birthday gift for my husband and relive for me. My skin is extremely sensitive and thin, so I can feel the difference in his shavings now. Keep doing your job braun.</li>
    <li> After using braun 7 series for more than a year, I understand that this works great and does what it is supposed to. This was a gift to my brother and he likes it.</li>
    <li> For all the bells an whistles, ultimately this is kind of just average for an electric razor. If you&#x27;re someone like me who likes to linger in that area between growing a beard and being completely clean shaving, it isn&#x27;t great. If you have more than 2 days worth of stubble and try to shave even on the lowest power setting it comes out spotty and uneven. There will be spots that are completely bare and then others that are just right, and then others that look exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;precision trimmer&amp;#34; *hardy har* is fairly disappointing as well. It seems extremely underpowered when you activate it and you have to hold it at an odd angle to get what you want it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The washing unit is great.. a little loud, but fast and does a good job. The pivot head works nicely, and the shave time you get out of it is really great. If you can get this at a cheap price it may be a good value, but I think I may have been better off with another choice.</li>
    <li> 1. Da. Shave&lt;br /&gt;2.Braun series 3 The 7 series is much quieter and shaves better.&lt;br /&gt;3.It&#x27;s a better mouse trap&lt;br /&gt;4. I don&#x27;t have any dislikes.&lt;br /&gt;5. Better.</li>
    <li> Quite compared to my old shaver.  My wife felt i needed ear plugs for the old one so i had to do something. I like the complete system.</li>
    <li> Delivers a smooth shave with no fuss. I expect I&#x27;ll be using this one for 10 years like the previous two that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it. He shaves for no reason now. It gets an amazingly close shave and it cleans itself. Military men can appreciate such a  razor.</li>
    <li> 3 weeks of use - still not geting a close shave - Returned to Braun under their 60 day satification guarantee</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my husband. (I figured after using his last shave, a Norelco, it was time for a new one). He still thought his old razor cut ok until he shaved with his new Braun. He absolutely loves it! I think he shaves just for the sake of playing with his &#x27;new toy.&#x27; No doubt about it.............5 stars all the way.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son-in-law and he is very happy with the uplsonic shaver system and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Although I prefer a manual razor for a close shave, this is a solid backup. The cleaner connected to this allow for you to feel like you bought a brand new blade every single shave. Great for close shaves although it takes longer than a traditional razor.</li>
    <li> Past experience w/Braun prompted me to try another higher grade model. Good choice! much closer shave than w/old 5000 series. So far, well satisfied w/higher priced model.</li>
    <li> I would love to give this 5 stars but am a little shocked in how fast the blade went dull and the pods don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor from a different retailer but wanted to add a review here because I do rely on customer reviews when I am making purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quite simply the best electric razor I have ever owned and that includes, rotary and straight, Norelco, Remington and Panasonic.  All of them were good but had areas they didn&#x27;t get well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Braun 760 for just over 2 months now and it is giving me the closest shave of any electric I&#x27;ve ever used and gets the problem area between the chin and Adam&#x27;s apple that none of the others were able to do well.  I am extremely happy with this product and can&#x27;t see myself using anything but a Braun going forward unless things go really sideways down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another piece of info.  The cleaning cartridge lasted right at 2 months running the cycle every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this bad boy for about a month now. This is a great shaver! I switched over from a rotary shaver to this Braun. I primarily use this shaver to touch my my cheek area between shaves with a real blade. I tried using on my neck and there was little or no irritation. Although it didn&#x27;t get everything on my neck I have a very thick beard so I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle. I haven&#x27;t used the self cleaning station because I&#x27;m usually good about cleaning out the head. It says on the box that it&#x27;s washable which is nice. The battery seems to be excellent. Charging station is light plastic, but should hold up without abuse. The charging cord can be detached and used directly into the shaver which will be nice for travel. This unit also comes with a hard &amp;#34;sunglasses&amp;#34; type traveling case. Would recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a much better performance. It is too noisy and reqire constant cleaning with special solution that is expensive.</li>
    <li> Easily the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Gives a smooth shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;-Cleans itself.&lt;br /&gt;-Amazing battery life.&lt;br /&gt;-Due to its power, gives a much faster shave than any other shaver I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Occasionally pulls hairs on the hairier parts of my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used cheaper electric razors prior to buying this one ($40-$60 range) and I was hesitant about buying one that costs this much.  However, after buying it I haven&#x27;t looked back as the lack of irritation on my face is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the kind of guy to beat around the bushes, so I&#x27;m going to be short and to the point... This is THE best electric shaver I have ever used PERIOD. Non-irritating mechanism with a totally close shave...I use this shaver instead of an actual blade and it does the job just as well. If you can afford it, I would seriously consider giving it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> The Braun 7-760cc shaver meets my shaving requirements with one exception being the design of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is located near the center of the razor making it difficult to judge exactly where the trimmer intercepts your sideburns.  Also the trimmer has a slight radius on it whereas my previous model had a straight cutting edge.  The designers need to modify the trimmer so that when it is extended, it comes closer to, or above, the top of the unit making it easier to see where you are trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the shaver is fine.</li>
    <li> I have used this non-stop for 3 years. Finally bought a new trimming head, which I should have done earlier, it makes a big difference. My beard is like a forest of nails, and this mows it right down, day after day. The cleaning station is a bit of a gimmick. There&#x27;s still hair in the cutting head, even after the long cleaning cycle. Ooh, and you can just rinse out the &amp;#34;cleaning solution&amp;#34; cartridge and refill it with wintergreen rubbing alcohol, available anywhere for almost free.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I owed a Braun in the pass and now 8 years later I had to replace it. I recommend it. It works great and the shipping was incredibly.</li>
    <li> VERY SLOW AND NOT VERY CLEAN, I THINK PHILIPS IS BETTER AND FASTER THAN THIS BRAND, WILL CHANGE NEXT TIME.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband and he loves it!</li>
    <li> The shaver is amazing. Effortless shave and it gets just as close as a razor without the burn and irritation. Plus the self cleaner makes it faster to clean your shaver.</li>
    <li> Razor gives an excellent, fast and very close shave. Sideburn trimmer is not easy to use. The head of the razor blocks the light and view when trying to use the trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun.  Works great, easy to clean.  Long battery life.  Saves so much money over using regular blades.</li>
    <li> Finally an electric that can match a blade for closeness without razor burn. Quick, comfortable, easy recharge and cleanup of the razor with a cleaning station. I am comparing the shave to my old Braun 5416 which has a new foil and cutter block. The 760cc-4 is the winner. Hope the 760 lasts as long as the old Braun. No more blades for this face!&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift, so shop around for best price. Amazon looks to be the lowest price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a better shaver. Love the way it informs you on level of charge remaining.  Extremely close shaves.  The only complaint I have is the trimmer.  It is practically impossible to see where it is trimming.</li>
    <li> By far best I have ever owned or used. Last charged three weeks ago and still have 60%. Shaves almost as close as straight edge</li>
    <li> Works well thus far (2 months). I will update this if problems arise.</li>
    <li> We had tried many cheaper shavers and they just really didn&#x27;t get rid of the facial hair, but this one does the job. Very close very smooth shave. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have used the Braun shaver for many years and this one is the best ever. It gives a close shave in less time than the older models.  The trimmer looks weak but is working so far.</li>
    <li> I used rotary razors for most my life(70 yrs)  and I love  it . Best shaves I ever had next to a blade!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.  Clean, close shave every time.  Researched electric shavers for some time before deciding on the Braun 760cc-4.  It is head and shoulders above any electric shaver I have owned previously.</li>
    <li> All my life, I have been a proponent of traditional wet shaving using a multi-blade cartridge.  I would occasionally use a rotary electrical shaver for convenience, but never could get the smoothness of a traditional wet shave.  I have a thick beard that seemed to chew through razors quickly, and I have a goatee that I have to navigate around, but also keep trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, all of the newer cartridge shaving systems have gone to these humongous multi-blade  monstrosities (some have 8 blades!!)  that make it difficult for me to shave around my goatee and the replacement blade prices have gone sky-high.  So I decided to explore alternative solutions.  My requirements were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: Close, smooth shave.  Nothing beats a blade; but the electric razor had to come pretty darn close and satisfy my rigorous requirements of no scratch when I drag my hand against my beard.&lt;br /&gt;2: Shave around my goatee:  I needed something that would come up close to my goatee without grabbing it and painfully yanking the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;3: Decent trimmer: I need to trim my goatee, hairs in my ears and around my nostrils without pain.  Also need to periodically trim some of those obscure sideways-growing neck hairs that hide in my neck wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;4: Quiet.  I had to be able to have a comfortable conversation or listen to TV/Radio whilst shaving.&lt;br /&gt;5: Travel-Friendly:  I travel frequently and internationally.  I needed something that was easy to pack, easy to clean, easy to recharge and wouldn&#x27;t turn on accidently in the suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched the web heavily, watched many youtube videos of each brand,  talked to many department store demo &amp;#34;dolly&#x27;s, conferred with countless friends and acquaintances,  and narrowed my search down to a few models that would meet most of my requirements.  But the Braun Series 7 fit the bill perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to meeting 100% of the requirements above (and yes, it really does allow me to shave close to my goateewithout pain), it came with a few other nice surprises definitely worth mentioning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: Fits nicely in the hand and comfortably shaves all facial areas.  This is a relatively small/light razor compared to most of the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;2: Comes with a super-cool cleaning/charging system that is not a gimmick ... it really does work!  It is super easy to use and when finished, the razor comes out like jewelry. Note that when travelling, you just use the recharge cord and the hand-brush to clean the razor.  Upon return from your trip, simply drop it into the cleaning system and it will tell you how dirty the razor is.  Hit the button and the cleaning cycle starts.&lt;br /&gt;3: Actually shaves those weird neck hairs!&lt;br /&gt;4: Long time between charges.  This probably will vary by user, but I take about 3-5 minutes per shave, and this razor lasts 2 weeks on a single charge (including trimming every other day or so).&lt;br /&gt;5: Comes with a very nice and small travel case protecting it and preventing it from turning on in the suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product ... even if Braun paid me. The price was right, performance after 3 months is still perfect and I have completely eliminated the use of cartridge razors.  I actually demo my Series 7 to friends and have let them take it for a test drive (remember the cleaning system completely sterilizes between each use).  They&#x27;ve become Series 7 fans too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps we should start a fan-club!</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel-numerous shaves on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use trimmer.</li>
    <li> Braun has lost their way. This shaver works okay, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as close of a shave as older models. Hopefully they get their act together soon, or else I&#x27;m switching to Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of electric razors over the years, rotary and foil types from Norelco and Remington.  This Braun is amazing!  I don&#x27;t dread shaving in the morning any more.  The automatic cleaning feature is really nice.  This razor is definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> This is now the 3rd Braun Pulsonic I have owned over the past 20+ years and wouldn&#x27;t even have needed this one if it wasn&#x27;t for a minor accident involving a teenager and a sketchy cat knocking it to the floor and breaking off the pop-up trimmer on the one I bought in 2003!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts an extremely long time, the daily/weekly cleaning keep the unit in top shape and the shave??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast and easy, ZERO razor-burn and close enough that my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow should be fired for showing up so late for work every darn day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL worth the investment as with minimal care Braun&#x27;s top-level shavers have served me faithful for at least a decade each!</li>
    <li> This only my second Braun in many years. The only reason I replaced the old one was because it no longer held a charge and the pins on the power cord no longer made good contact. The new one is still built just as good as the old one but the design of the trimmer is too narrow and in an awkward postion - don&#x27;t break something that&#x27;s not broke!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun 8585 for... as long as it had come out (8+ years?).  I lost the charger on a trip to South America and decided to upgrade to the newest top of the line Braun.  I didn&#x27;t need the 790 so went down to the 760 after reading reviews from The Consumer Reports and The Wirecutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for almost 2 months and just sent it in to the 60-day Braun Money Back Guarantee yesterday (Hope they actually get me a refund) because my old 8000 series shaved better for me.  Here are couple of issues I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The shaving foil and the &amp;#34;cutter&amp;#34; inside are not flush against each other.  I thought at first it was broken because I would try to shave like my old shaver and it wasn&#x27;t shaving anything off.  You have to apply quite a bit of pressure to get the cutter against the foil so it gets close to the skin/stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The ultrasonic &amp;#34;vibrating&amp;#34; head doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to me.  It is actually a negative because I can&#x27;t hear the shaver &amp;#34;cutting&amp;#34; my stubble nor can I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it cutting.  All I hear and feel is the vibrating head, no matter what level of vibration (3 different levels) I couldn&#x27;t hear it shaving nor could I feel it.  With my 8585 I could feel it shaving my stubble and I could somewhat feel when it was done shaving without having to pass my hand over my face.  With the 760 even after I&#x27;ve done multiple passes I could still feel the stubble when I pass my hand over them.  I would have to go through more than 3x of what I did with my old shaver.  As per instructions I tried for at least 2 weeks (more like almost 2 months) and I saw no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) My skin began chafing after 3 weeks.  Under my chin, my skin began to almost look like small pimples were forming at each stubble and the shaver was &amp;#34;cutting&amp;#34; them making my skin white (imagine a thin layer of skin being shaved at each stubble).  I tried using pre-shave lotion to see if it would help.  I tried shaving after a shower (Braun recommends shaving before shower, when your face is dry), and all different ways with no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Comments: I would guess if your skin is ok with it, it&#x27;s not a bad shaver.  And I can&#x27;t say any other shaver is better because I didn&#x27;t compare, I just ended up going back to my old Braun shaver by buying a charging cable for my 8585 from eBay (they are $120 new from Braun!! yikes!!) and my happy shaving continues.g after a shower (Braun recommends shaving before shower, when your face is dry), and all different ways with no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Comments: I would guess if your skin is ok with it, it&#x27;s not a bad shaver.

    <li> I got a Braun electric razor model 6995 on June 9th, 2008, but in 2013, decided I would upgrade to a newer model.  My wife bought me a Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver in October 2013.  After using the new razor for a few months and not being impressed in the closeness of the shave, I went back and tried my old model 6995.  After switching razors for a few weeks, I definitely like the old 6995 the best.  It gives a closer shave, and in less time.  So the moral of this story, if the &amp;#34;razor isn&#x27;t broke&amp;#34; and you like the shave, don&#x27;t buy a newer version expecting to get a better shave.  Of course, now that the return window has passed, I&#x27;m stuck with this 7-760cc razor, although I am going to keep shaving the the older, but  better, model 6995.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has really thick facial hair and he loves it! He hasn&#x27;t complained of any ingrown hairs in weeks. Its easy to use and the self cleaning function works great. Definitely 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Gives a good clean shave, the cleaning system has been successful so far giving each use a clean feel without pulling of facial hair like some electric razors can have.</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> NO MORE RAZOR BURN. It is great, but just make sure you want to buy it and keep it because amazon does not allow returns. I wanted to return it because the 790 was available for the same price after a coupon. But, I am happy because the higher model just has more features that I do not really use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I really love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor. I have a thick coarse beard and it cuts through it with relative ease. A few double passes are necessary to catch the stragglers. I shave after showering and drying my face. It is a closer shave than my previous rotary razor. I have fairly sensitive skin, especially around the neck area and i receive very little if any irritation, especially if my skin is dry and the razor can glide over easily. I try not to shave daily so I can get a closer shave, but I have done so and only notice a small difference. The cleaning station is nice, I use it when I charge the razor (approximately every 4 weeks with shaves every other day). The battery life is great. We shall see how well it lasts.</li>
    <li> I decided it was time to try a different approach after 48 years of flipping between a blade and  rotary shavers. My electric gave out and is 12 years old. This unit is quiet, gives a very decent shave and is comfortable to use. My face does not look all torn up and I think twice a week cleaning with the system should be more than adequate for maintenance. I do not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> My husb has one,we bought it for a gift for our son for his birthday.He loves it.You get what you pay for.Good brands last longer.Amazon has the best price than other stores.i do most of my shopping at Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Very good, very easy to use, and portable bag to go, good price, special time to buy, I very love！！</li>
    <li> Because everything was the way I expected. I&#x27;ll order other things again thank you. I&#x27;d like to order an i-phone 5-s, but I&#x27;m not sure it will be sent exactly what exactly I ordered, color, case etc</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  I bought it on the recommendation of the Sweethome website, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I switched from being a razor and shaving cream guy to this dry electric shave.  I&#x27;m impressed with how smooth the razor gets my face and neck.  It shaved (ha!) five minutes a morning off my time in the bathroom.  The cleaning solution really works - it feels fresh every time you take it out of the cradle every morning.  Such a great device.</li>
    <li> Close shave, quiet, easy to use and easy on the skin.  Self cleaning.  Long battery life. Convenient sideburns clipper.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I splurged and bought the Braun Clean and Charge 7900 or whatever the model was, back in 2000 when they first came out.  $200 was pretty ridiculous for an electric shaver at the time, but I bought it and loved it.  I used it for over 10 years.  It was the best shaver I had ever used.  Sadly, after 10 or 11 years of use, it ceased to turn on.  I soldered on some new batteries but it did not revive the shaver, my old friend.  The whole system was flawless, cleaning system worked great the entire time, until finally the shaver died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it was 2011 and I needed a new shaver.  I looked at Braun&#x27;s lineup and now they have all these cheaper models and don&#x27;t bother to differentiate them other than using buzzwords.  I thought I was being smart and responsible when I &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; bought the ~$115 370cc.  I used that shaver for about 2 years, and it was terrible.  It just felt weak and slow.  It pained me to get rid of a new purchase, and throw good money after bad -- who knows, maybe the more expensive ones are terrible these days, too!  So I suffered for almost 2 years with that thing, until the cutting foil needed replacing, and I wasn&#x27;t going to put more money into this junk (the head is incompatible with the nicer ones.. the cartridges *are* compatible so I didn&#x27;t mind &#x27;investing&#x27; in those).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to splurge on myself with some Christmas money, and bought the 760cc (same as the 790cc I think, but I prefer the black color).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even have to finish opening the packaging to know that this is the real deal.  It&#x27;s solid and smooth metal, it feels expensive.  German precision.  Not any heavier than my 370 but somehow feels nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 seconds of shaving is all it took to realize this thing is a beast.  The motor spins the cutter easily twice as fast, and the shave is simply amazing.  It&#x27;s obviously not fair to compare a worn cutter on my 370 to the new one on the 760, but I was never happy with the 370 and am thrilled with the760.  That&#x27;s all you need to know.</li>
    <li> My husband needs a shaver that won&#x27;t cut his face, so I purchased this for him.  He has repeated often what a good shaver this is.  What more do I have to say?</li>
    <li> Its as good as any high quality electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned. I had a Braun shaver previously that lasted many years. This new one gives a noticeably cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 11-year old 7526 model (which replaced my 1989 Braun shaver - still the best one ever).  It&#x27;s OK.  I shaves me a bit closer than the 7526 does now, but I think that&#x27;s because the replacement cutter &amp; screen aren&#x27;t as good as the originals.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it should, especially in the neck area.  NOTE:  the flip-out trimmer is a big step backwards.  Cute &amp; flimsy, it&#x27;s too narrow to easily shave the back of the neck.  I want to keep buying Brauns ... I guess I&#x27;ll have another chance in 10 years or so.  Hope they&#x27;re better by then</li>
    <li> This is very best shaver going. Quiet and you don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over the same spot. This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and better than the first.</li>
    <li> He has tried several other brands electric razors, but the Braun is by far the best.  Close shave and ease of use!</li>
    <li> This cleaning system is unique, convenient and remarkable. Excellent for tough beard that requires shaving more than once a day.</li>
    <li> A step up from model I purchased for my husband a few years ago.  He says it&#x27;s much better than previous one and he loved that one.  Definite recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  Found it on Amazon for half the price than everywhere else!  He had a Braun 3 series and loved it.  His response after using this...Unbelievable shave!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Well for starters, this is the very first review I have ever given any product I have ever bought. After extensive research the reviews and price is what brought me to purchase this razor. Amazon was offering $15.00 insatnt rebate and $40.00 credit towards my next purchase of anything I bought from Amazon. This put the razor in range of what I wanted to put on an electric razor, which I was sure that I&#x27;d be returning. The reason I thought I&#x27;d be returning it, is that I&#x27;m 45 and have tried numerous electric shavers over the years and have never even had one come remotely close to giving up razor blades and shaving cream. I went about 3 days of not shaving before it arrived and when I used the razor after it arrived, I was truelly astonished. I&#x27;ve read reviews of it being noisy, but seemed pretty quiet to me. It knocked out the three days of stubble in less than 5 min., not once did it feel like it was yanking or pulling the hairs and didn&#x27;t burn or cause any irritation to my skin. I was ready to write the review right then, but being the sceptic that I am decided to wait 30 days to be sure. In the meantime I discovered that the cleaning system was pretty great as well. I only use it after about 3 or 4 shaves and it cleans great and leaves it with an awesome clean smell. My brother inlaw came in for Christmas and used it and said he was going to get one as well and he&#x27;s a bigger sceptic than I am. It has now been 30 days and I&#x27;m as happy with it as the first day I used it, I had heard comments made that it had made people actually look forward to shaving and I have to admit, I am one of those people now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband, and he says it is the closest shave he ever got from an electric razor.  The cleaning system is an added benefit.</li>
    <li> The best that I can be happy about. I get nicked now and then but I attribute that to my hair type. A good combo with that dry pre-shave stick.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this shaving system!  At first, I had a few doubts, but I&#x27;ve never had a shaver like this. After my older model Braun died, I purchased a Norelco with 3 spinning heads. Didn&#x27;t care for it as the heads would spin way too slowly and I had constant &#x27;catching&#x27; - argh - &#x27;hate that when that happens! This shaver&#x27;s got guts! It goes and goes! I&#x27;d recommend this shaving system to anyone who wants a great shave everyday!</li>
    <li> I looked and compared many products before selecting this one, I am totally satisfied with this purchase.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does the job well on face, arms and legs</li>
    <li> Shaves great.  Side trimmer broke one month after warranty expired.</li>
    <li> This shaver has worked great so far, two issues I have are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pulls sometimes when shaving next to my goatee&lt;br /&gt;took my upper lip a month to get used to the trimmer, it tickled so bad at first I couldn&#x27;t use it to trim my upper lip</li>
    <li> It does a great job. I have just had to spend some time learning how to use it properly. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Forever done with handheld. Let&#x27;s bmme get a close and consistent shave time and time again. Highly suggest this product</li>
    <li> so far,very satisfied</li>
    <li> Shave is great and comfortable but the finish is flaking off and razor head is pitting, ridiculous as my Braun razor is less than one year old.  It has become so bad the black finish gets on me when I shave.  Not what I expected for a nearly $200 razor.</li>
    <li> After reading extensive online reviews of this Braun Series 7 shaver, I was convinced it was the perfect replacement for my 4-year old Norelco 8151XL rotary shaver.  I have used it for 7 months and am dissatisfied with its performance.  Unless I shave every day, my beard gets too long for the Braun to give a clean shave.  A 3-4 day beard is nearly impossible without getting razor burn.  On the plus side, it has a very intricate and functional cleaning system.  But my old Norelco simply rinsed off in the bathroom sink and sat out to dry.  Sometimes simple is better.</li>
    <li> the cleaning liquid is spent fast</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition. The product is exactly as it was described online and functions properly. For an electric razor it does a very good job. It is still not as close as a blade, but that it to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about it is that it does not pull. Meaning, even after 2-3 days of not shaving the Braun cuts right through the hair without any facial discomfort or sensation that it is ripping the hair out of your face. For me, that is the area where it is truly superior. I have cheaper electric shavers that seem to give an equally close shave. Those same cheaper shavers also get the job done just as quick as the Braun. But the Braun can easily handle a thick, coarse 2-3 day growth without causing any &amp;#34;pulling/hair plucking&amp;#34; discomfort or post shave irritation.</li>
    <li> very poor shaver in fact their travel battery shaver is much more efficient and quiet would not recommend at all</li>
    <li> I love this product. I look forward to shaving when i wake up in the morning thanks to this shaver. I recomend</li>
    <li> This was a great gift! My husband loves this razor! It gives him a close shave that literally feels like he used a metal razor with shaving cream!</li>
    <li> STILL THE BEST. MY PREVIOUS ONE STILL WORKS EXCEPT FOR THE TRIMMER. HEADS LAST 18 MONTHS AND STILL SHAVE.HAD PANASONIC, IT WORE OUT HEADS FAST AND TOOK LONG TO CUT.GET 7 SERIES.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had for almost two years and can&#x27;t count on one hand how many times I&#x27;ve used a traditional razor since then.  This thing is amazing for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Still learning which setting works best.</li>
    <li> This was my second Braun shaver, and I love it.  My first one got lost in luggage.  The self cleaning is great, and it cuts close and comfortably.  I have relatively sensitive skin and adjust to this quickly.  No burn.  Highly recommended (though the Clean and Renew refills are a cost to consider).</li>
    <li> Nice razor... replaced a 3 wheel unit and never going back.</li>
    <li> Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver my  father is so like this  take good for me thank amazon</li>
    <li> I get a close shave every day and it is quick and easy. The shaver cleans it self and all I have to do is put it in the stand and push a button.</li>
    <li> You know - I have always wanted to try a Braun - don&#x27;t know why - it always seemed like a good razor - I use a Norelco SensoTouch now and it gives me a good shave - but I don&#x27;t try a Braun for one reason - a LONG time ago, I had a Remington foil shaver - don&#x27;t even know if they still make them - but it was that one with three heads - I actually thought it shaved good - BUT the big problem is the foil always ripped for me - now when I shave - I press HARD on my face - Norelco heads could handle it because it&#x27;s hard - but that Remington foil ripped for me - I bought a new head - I wear used it once or twice and it ripped immediately again - scared me off from foil shavers for life - I&#x27;d like to try this - but it is too expensive to use twice and have a ripped foil and cut myself.  Remember - I press very hard when I shave - and foil shavers rip too easy- at least it did for me - Scared of buying a foil.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick beard when it grows and unlike others, I have no problems growing one. Shaving has always been a hassle and a chore for me. For the last 20 years, I&#x27;ve usually just had a close trim beard as this was much easier to deal with. When I did shave, whether with a blade or an electric razor, it was always a hassle and never a really close shave. I&#x27;d normally would need to shave twice, once with a blade and then again with an electric razor, or vice versa.No matter what blade I would use, or electric razor I bought (I always had the electric razor with the 3 round heads). And when I did use those kind of electric razors I always had bad skin irritation and felt like it was rubbing my skin raw if I really wanted to get a close shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then on one of my tech/gadget-websites I visit daily they spoke about Braun Series 7-760cc and how it was one of the cheapest prices they ever saw currently running at that time on Amazon. They also mentioned it was highest rated electric razor on Amazon from users who bought one. After a bit of research I decided to give it a try and I bought one too...and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Braun Series 7-760cc is the MOST COMFORTABLE shave I have EVER had - consistently and every day now.&lt;br /&gt;It is the closest shave I have ever had and still is daily.&lt;br /&gt;I now shave daily  - something I haven&#x27;t done for 20+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for others, but for me and with my beard growth, the Braun Series 7-760cc is the best shaver I have ever used and have become a customer for Bruan&#x27;s razors for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note.... the automatic cleaner works perfectly for me and I would recommend this product and the automatic cleaner to anyone else as this makes cleaning the razor absolutely hassle free and couldn&#x27;t be happier. An easy 10 Stars if Amazon offered it for their products - so a 5 star will have to do.</li>
    <li> It is very nice to have a cleaner for the unit.  I have had many Braun shavers.  This is about equal to the others.</li>
    <li> Researched lots of brands and models. This product received many rave reviews and my husband agrees. He has been using it about 1 1/2 weeks. Gets close, smooth shaves like his manual Fusion shaver but without the nicks.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t quite give this 5 stars.  The shaver is excellent and what I&#x27;ve come to expect from Braun (this is my 3 Braun shaver in about 15 years).  But at the top of the line, I would have expected 2 things that my other Brauns came with: a protective cover for the shaver head and a travel case.  You definitely will NOT be disappointed with the shaver and cleaning system, but the lack of these small items might make you feel that something was forgotten when the unit was packed at the factory.</li>
    <li> I was thinking that I would receive a superior product, but instead just a normal shaver, nothing great about it...</li>
    <li> First couple of uses I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed but if you actually pull your skin taught and take a little time this thing really does give an amazingly close shave. You do have to go over the tricky spots a few times but it really is a comfortable shave that with some patience can give a closer shave than my blades. Does a great job on my face, neck, chest and belly with very little irritation.</li>
    <li> Love it. Best shave, best value. This is a replacement for a five year old Braun shaver. This unit performance is great.</li>
    <li> This razor works well on my face just not on my neck. I still have to use a straight blade to shave the bulk of my neck. more so probably due to my neck hairs growing in every direction. Overall a good razor.</li>
    <li> My husband has stayed away from electric shavers for probably 40 years, but just decided to try one again.  He was very impressed and is enjoying it immensely!!</li>
    <li> good feel and comfortable to use, excellent shaving results, would like a better sideburn trimmer.  over all avery good shaver.</li>
    <li> Not quite as close a shave as I would have expected from one of their top of the line shavers, but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> it was perfect, it is everything that i needed and i love it. i highly would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband used a Braun Shaver for years very similar to the new model.  It was time to replace the old.  First, he bought a $40 Braun shaver to replace the old one.  It definitely was a waste of money.  You get what you pay for was true in this case. He decided to spend the money to get a shaver that would give him a good shave.  This new model with all the bells and whistles produces a very good shave.  He puts it in the cleaner after each use, as recommended by Braun.  We highly recommend spending the money to get a good shaver.</li>
    <li> Good feeling, this shaver was very good, auto clean system is very easy to use. But the package was broken.</li>
    <li> I think it is very deserve for the price. I bought it in the today&#x27;s deal I very love it.</li>
    <li> I got it for my husband and he said that it is the best shaver system. It shaves smoothly and leaves no uncovered areas. My husband said he would recommend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Although the shaver itself is good, the trimmer design is so poor that I regret making the purchase.  I have to use my old Braun razor to trim my sideburns.  The trimmer from old razor is falling part but it still works better than the new razor.  The main problem with the new trimmer is that it only works at certain angles.  Another problem is that the trimmer has to be flipped up perpendicularly before using it.  In some scenarios, I inadvertently flip it down during usage, thus disengaging the trimmer.  The trimmer from old razor is pushed up vertically and maintains congruency.  An issue I have with Braun razors in general is the built-in cleaner.  The cleaning solution/liquid for the cleaner only lasts a short while and it&#x27;s too expensive to keep replacing it.</li>
    <li> My wife got me this as  a gift . It is a really good shaver, I like that it is self cleaning and the replacement pieces are not too expensive. The only complaint is the trimmer is not very good. It feels like it is ripping my hair out when I use it.</li>
    <li> this product could not have been any better&lt;br /&gt;It changed my perception of electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shave is closer than manual shavers&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-cheers</li>
    <li> It is worth every penny......I really like it......I have tried a lot of shavers....and this one is the SH!@#$!!!! Buy it without think it is totally worth it</li>
    <li> works great and easy to clean with the brush available in the package even without running it through the cleaning system. the only thing is, the cleaning solution goes quickly meaning you have to keep spending money to use this product</li>
    <li> The only problem with it my husband said that when he shaves in the morning he has hair growing out by the evening. It&#x27;s not much to worry about though. just have to shave again since it is so easy. Thank you for the fast service.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy not having to clean a razor after using it.  Of course, this shaver works very well and has three different modes of shaving, which is nice, but what I really love is how close the shave is, and how comfortable it is in my hand.  I was initially put off by how much it cost, but so far it has been a great investment.</li>
    <li> My sons review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old razor went out, so I got this one for Christmas and it&#x27;s awesome! It shaves good &amp; everything works right. It tells you when it needs the liquid to be renewed and it cleans the razor well. You have to open the head up and clean it. It tells you when it needs to be charged and how long it has in the battery until it needs charging. The head turns when you go from under your chin to your face to get the hair shaved better. Overall it&#x27;s a great razor to have.</li>
    <li> I am 30, and I have never had a shave like this product gets my face with something electrical nor mechanical. It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic. Completly soft, the battery lasts for weeks, works simply fantastic and as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made in Germany, so there you have your quality guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really easy to use, easy to wash, easy to keep and carry on. If you travel you won&#x27;t even need to carry the cable, as the battery lasts for days, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended</li>
    <li> This shaver has glowing reports but I found it more complicated to disassemble and clean and the shave is not better than my two previous shavers which are half the price..</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever had. It cuts close enough to the skin to pass military regulations, yet does not irritate the skin because I do not have to pass by the same area multiple times to get every hair.</li>
    <li> By far the best performing electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried. Only used for a month but shaving is very close and easy. Wonderfully engineered and looks like their system should keep it working as well as it does now.</li>
    <li> Razor is average, takes a long time to shave and struggles to get the rougher parts smooth without going over it dozens of times. The worst part is the return policy. used it once, realized it wasn&#x27;t very good. Now I have to mail it to Maryland and wait 10 weeks for a refund. Just buy anything else.</li>
    <li> I had an older version of the Braun Pulsonic Shaver and it served me well for years. When it began to fail I decided on buying a newer version. The older version did a great job on short hairs, but if I skipped shaving for a day or two it struggled to efficiently cut the longer hairs. The new version is much improved in that area, while retaining all the good features of the older version. It&#x27;s also less noisy when running.</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well, even around the neck. I previously used a Philips rotary model, and this one shaves much better an in less the time. The trimmer works well, and the battery lasts long. I wish I had bought this shaver before.</li>
    <li> very good. High quality!</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this razor (despite the overwhelmingly good reviews) because of the bad reviews. Especially the ones comparing this razor to the old Braun razors.  This new one is far better than my old one which I liked very much.  Shaving with this new Braun is about as fast and just as efficient as shaving with a blade but no cuts or razor burn.  Fear not, this is a great razor.</li>
    <li> All claims are true. Absolutely the best shaver Ive owned. Braun has done a a fantastic job engineering this model. Highly recommed it, as I didnt believe in electric shavers before this.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t expect anything but excellence from Braun</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I heard so many good things about it. It delivered on its every word. Very happy with the purchase. The shaver works really well and now I dont have to worry about shaving and making it a big deal. I just shave whenever I want. Great buy, everyone should have a shaver like this. Thanks Amazon.!</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Quiet and close shave. Even works well on my head!  I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers before and this one is definitely the best.</li>
    <li> The cleaning feature is great.  Keeps the shaver clean and working well. I like the adjustable features, holds a charge good for many shaves.  Much quieter than my previous shaver and doesn&#x27;t pull on the skin.</li>
    <li> Closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever had but electric razor great product. I used to use Gillette mach3 turbo razors, but now I only used this shaver and I have saved more money that I thought I ever would. Bye bye Gillette, Hello Braun...... Very happy with this purchase. not to mention my wife loves this shaver, I will be purchasing another one so I can keep her away from mine.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. I have been a blade user my entire life, but was getting tired of having to soak and lather my face prior to every shave. Dull blades, empty shaving cream cans were also a common problem and a hassle. I was worried about how close an electric would be able to get. For the first week of use I ran into a few issues. The shave quality was okay but not great. The shaver was also irritating my neck and causing lots of redness that was slow to disperse. After the initial break in period though (and with some changes to my technique), I am now getting a great shave from this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have found to work is:&lt;br /&gt;1). Don&#x27;t push too hard. If the device feels overly hot, you are pushing it into your skin too hard.&lt;br /&gt;2). Put in the time. I will usually do 2-3 passes over my face, working my way around clockwise in zones. It takes a little longer but gives a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Angles. The neck has always been a problem area for me, and at first this shaver was not getting all of the hair on my neck. To get that close shave, try running the shaver across your face at different angles until you find which ones work for you. For me it is turning the blades vertical, and then running them across my neck in a horizontal fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife cannot tell the difference between the Braun and a blade now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Very close shave, nearly if not as close as a blade (if done right).&lt;br /&gt;+ Comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;+ Pop out trimmer is of a good size and position on the device.&lt;br /&gt;+ The self cleaning base always keeps the razor clean and fresh&lt;br /&gt;+ No more shaving prep work (soak, lather, etc)</li>
    <li> A significant improvement in technology over my several year old Braun. That said though, this one is virtually impossible to clean by hand with cleaning brush, due to construction of the head. I remove the head weekly, and blow it out thoroughly with a can of air, like you use on computers. Then I use the cleaning machine with the Braun cartridges every other week.If the stuff weren&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d use it every time!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and just love it, clean shave and easy to clean, charger works great too. love it.</li>
    <li> When my series 3 Braun died I decided to try the 7-760cc. After using it for a month now it gives me a closer shave in less time. Cleaning is much faster and not as noisy as the series 3. The lithium ion battery seems to hold a charge longer too. All in all very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really like the shaver and how easy it is to clean. It however does not cut a baby smooth shave the way I hoped it would for the price it is.</li>
    <li> High quality as all Braun products I&#x27;ve owned.  Smooth shave.  The trimmer design/placement seems a bit awkward, but I can&#x27;t say exactly how I&#x27;d improve it, and that&#x27;s a minor issue for me.</li>
    <li> Because of this razor shaving has been simplified immensely and turned from a hassle, days of irritation, and red spots all over my neck into something no more of a bother than brushing my teeth in the morning. The self-cleaning is great, I get a really close shave for an electric razor(not as close as a bladed razor on my neck, but it doesn&#x27;t leave behind anything noticeable, and I have pretty thick hair) and zero irritation. This razor is a win, no regrets.</li>
    <li> I like it but there are few flaws.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- easy to use.  Gives a great smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- no sideburn trimmer.  I don&#x27;t understand how the charger works.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for face and head.  Gets my head smooth and bald.</li>
    <li> Disappointed!  After reading all the reviews on this product I expected it to be an improvement over my aged Panasonic.  It is not unfortunately. Good shaver but not as good as Panasonic.</li>
    <li> my BRAUN works as advertised.Anice close shave and easy to work and clean. very happy with it.</li>
    <li> this works better than anything else electric for shaving my head, and works nicely on my face - now that it has adjustable closeness (I keep it at the closest setting), it is my favorite razor, even over more expensive Panny&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it. It didn&#x27;t seem to shave close and caused some irritation. I decided to give it the recommended time and continued to use for about 30 days. Once your face adjusts to this shaver, it works excellently. It shaves just about as close as a real razor, and i haven&#x27;t had any problems with irritation at all. I used to get ingrown hairs all the time, and this has eliminated that as well. The only &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; thing is the cleaning function is a little bit loud, so don&#x27;t hit clean right before bed or anything like that because it will be annoying. Overall its a great system though.</li>
    <li> I came from a cheapo $40 Norelco shaver which I ended up using primarily for the trimmer rather than the shaver. Upon using the Series 7, I was quite impressed with the overall quality of the shaver - well made and solid. The cleaning unit works well and leaves your shaver smelling great after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, despite the quality feel and build of the shaver, the actual shaving performance is pretty mediocre. It does fairly well above the jawbone, but it ends up struggling below the jawbone on the neck area. This is a daily shaver if you want optimal performance out of it... it just does not do 2+ day shaves very well. You will end up passing over areas multiple times to get all of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving performance just doesn&#x27;t seem to reflect all of the technology utilized by this shaver. It will do the job, but you may end up getting frustrated making 5 or so passes over some areas of your neck to get all of the hairs.</li>
    <li> I have used many lower tier electric razors in my life and I wanted to step up to something that would be of excellent quality. This razor makes shaving so much easier, because of it&#x27;s automatic cleaning and charging station. It gives a very close shave that is almost as close as a fresh disposal razor every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is also AMAZING, as I found out during military flight training. I had forgotten my charging cable at home, but I was able to use this daily for over a month on just one full charge.</li>
    <li> The best shave I have ever had using an electric razor. It&#x27;s better than the Braun Series 5. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Takes 4-5 passes over same area.  Braun has NO parts or repair closer than 1,000 miles.  If a part fails, I must ship it to Mass. and wait for it to be fixed.  Meanwhile, I have no shaver.  Moustache/Sideburn trimmer is useless.  Cost too much for dissatisfaction.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable product - although it is bit pricey -  it lives up to the Braun reputation - Tell your friends it is a great system</li>
    <li> It does not shave closely enough. I&#x27;m very disappointed that it does not shave more closely. I could never use it in place of a razor.</li>
    <li> Cannot be happier and satisfied with my Braun Series 7 shaver system, It does it all, you put it in the cleaner system and cleans, lubricates, dries and maintains the blades in optimum condition, it&#x27;s been a while now shaving myself and it still works excellent like the first day ...love it!!!</li>
    <li> Did not meet expectations.  I have a tuff beard and I don&#x27;t get a satisfied shave.</li>
    <li> It was a present for my father. Worked well.</li>
    <li> its not been a month and i (the husband) can write a review since i have given it a fair shake. anyone going from a razer to an electric shaver should know taht no matter what electric shaver you get it takes a few weak of at least every other day use to get the best shave possible. your skin has to get use to it and the hair grows in a lil differently then it does from a razer shave. i know that i wont get as close  a shave from an electric then i would a regular razer but im lazy and wanted something i can do at any time with out having to run hot water, wait for the hairs to soften (i have thick hair) so it was time to step it up. id say about 85 percent of the hairs you shave off actually stay inside the machine which i didnt expect so staying clean was a nice bonus. if a razer makes me feel 100 percent smooth then this thing makes me feel about 90 percent smooth which is close enough for me. it doesnt bite, smooth to use on any part of the face. if i had to buy it again i dont know if i would..not because it doesnt work well but i wonder if something for half the price can do the same job? if you have the money to blow then by all means yes buy it, its a great electric but i dont think it would hurt to try something cheaper first.</li>
    <li> Been using about a month now, and it is definitely the closest shave I have ever gotten with an electric shaver.  Pricey but worth the cost, I just hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who was strictly a razor man because of his heavy beard. But his face is sensitive and he had to shave every other day to avoid nicking and redness. Not only does this product do the job, but he has never been smoother after his shave and he can shave now everyday without the redness and nicks. It took him a few days to get used to the pivoting head and how best to angle it, but he is a champ now and the self cleaning aspect is great! He gets a clean, antiseptic shave every day that is closer than a blade.     Shipping was fast and product came as expected. Price was $100 below retail. So I got a killer deal here. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun 5-series shaver for the last 10 years,  and I thought it was great. Replaced the batteries once.  But it finally wasn&#x27;t cutting as well despite changing heads. So I began looking around and naturally looked at Braun again. Frankly, I was put off at the cost of the newest Series 7 shavers and I was not impressed with the requirement for the cleaning and charging dock that would clutter up my sink area. But now even the new Series 5 shavers have the dock. And Braun&#x27;s website has a nice comparison tool to see what your money is buying between the lower priced 5 and higher priced 7 series. Biggest difference seems to be the newest cutting system. But would it work? Was it worth the extra cost or is it a gimmick. Well, my wife settled the issue for me by purchasing the razor at a big box store for list price, but I had her return it because of the better Amazon price. So, now the test. Is it better?  In two words, absolutely yes.  First it offers 3 closeness settings, and they do really change the behavior of the razor so you need to try them to see what works for your face. The floating head really works to keep the screen at a very good cutting angle. The razor is very easy to use at odd angles to your face. My beard has kind of an oblique grain and to get the closest shave under my neck the razor must make a unique angle, and it goes very well.  As far as cleaning, the blade cartridge is very complex especially compared to my old 5-series. While you can clean this razor by running it under water and using the included brush, it is really best cleaned as Braun designed it to be, in the docking station.  So yes, the docking station is not a gimmick, but it definitely makes the razor work better. How do I know for sure?  I took the razor on vacation cleaning it the conventional way and could see it wasn&#x27;t getting as clean as it could. One trip to the docking cleaning station and it was like new. And did I mention that the razor is very quiet? I mean VERY quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also probably say that I religiously use the Afta product line of electric pre shave and after shave.  These are creamy products rather than just liquid alcohol.  Since I&#x27;ve always used them I cannot be certain if this influences the outcome for me versus someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary a bit pricy, but the shave is impressively smooth (as my wife will attest to), quiet and the docking station is not a gimmick. I hope that I can get 10 years out of this one too. It seems to be build like most Braun products, very solidly. Finally, this razor was rated tops by a leading consumer publication. Now I&#x27;m always suspicious about these ratings, but this product seems to live up to the score given it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional note, if you use a rotary razor and try a foil razor you&#x27;ll probably never go back. Although it has been a while (my razor previous to the Braun 5 was a Norelco which replaced a disappointing Remington foil product, but that was probably 30 years ago) I have never regretted the switch to Braun foil razors.  Of course every man&#x27;s beard is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/2012 - still on the original blade cassette. Braun says to change every 18 months, but I am past that now. Keeping the razor clean is essential. The cleaning system is very good at this but you still need regular manual brushing of the beard hairs from inside every once and a while. I still highly recommend this series of razor. My shave is as close as when new and takes no longer to shave.</li>
    <li> really good choice, i would recommend to all of you, also the price was really cheap heard its much more expensive in the mall</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these Braun &#x27;self-washing&#x27; shavers since they first came out...and this is only my second one!  I&#x27;ve had it a couple months now and it works just as well as my first one (of which I can&#x27;t remember the model, but like I said, it was one of the very first ones they made...it lasted for years).  Shaves very close, I like the side-trimmer pop out, does a great job getting the shaver clean in between uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the cleaning cycle takes a lot longer than my old model.  Most of the time is spent drying...the old model had a fan that would blow dry it each time.  I think this one uses some kind of heat so it&#x27;s much quieter but takes at least twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a great shaver though, hopefully I get several years out of this one as well!</li>
    <li> It met my expectations.  Close shave and quite fast.  Easy to clean and store.  I would recommend7-760cc the Braun Series</li>
    <li> Updated Post May 2017:&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased this Series 7 razor on December 2, 2013, replaced the razor head on June 23, 2015 and it Still Works Great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original batter is still holding strong and the battery life is excellent.  I travel full time and only take the charging cable if I am gone more than 14 days and have never had a problem.  My facial hair is thick and heavy, so if I do go more than day without shaving it you can hear the razor struggle to cut through.  However, it has never failed me.  I have been getting a consistent shave, with every use for the last 3.5 Years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Post:&lt;br /&gt;Perfect of Heavy on Thick facial hair.  This razor is solidly built and feels like great machine in your hand; it has that same low hmmm of a barbershop razor.  The foil and blades are much more substantial in quality and build than the Panasonic competition.  The shave is near perfect; I could not be happier with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the cleaning station, which I thought would be a joke, but I am glad to be wrong.  The case is perfect for travel, and provides total protection of the unit.  If you for get to charge the razor, you can just use the power cord directly.  Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really nervous dropping more than $100 bucks on an electric razor, but this thing is well worth it!</li>
    <li> Twice as close in half the time!..  I have been using electric shavers for 60 years...  and this is the best shaver..  My previous one was the older model 8595 with the same cleaning system... but did not shave as close and fast as this one.  Specially on the neck line.&lt;br /&gt;VERY happy with this shaver.  Now I do not mind shaving everyday!</li>
    <li> Simply put, although it is expensive, it is worthy it for something that I have to do every day. Closer shave and much more comfortable than lower priced shavers.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I had looked all over the internet for the best electric shavers on the market, and this one always seem to make the list. It is nice to have when you travel since you don&#x27;t have to have shaving cream or other accessories unless you choose too. Which this comes with a nice traveling pouch to put the shaver and a brush to wipe off the detailing blade. The only problem is you have to sometimes press a little to make sure it is getting all the hair. Overall a money saver in the long run without having to use disposable shavers. A big plus is I have never had to be scared of cutting my chin or anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Is exactly as you would expect. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This electric razor cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard more. Manual razor is more suitable for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the electric razor is not clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use an older model Braun for 10+ years.  Felt I was ready for a new upgrade.  This model is quieter and definitely gives me a closer and quicker shave.</li>
    <li> Much better shave than I expected, with minimal irritation.  It works even better with a few drops of shaving oil.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Braun.  It works very well for general shaving, especially the flexibility of three different sensitivity settings.  My only knock is that it does not quite fully cut some stubborn hairs on upper lip as well as the last Braun, or my lip hair has changed.:)</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this shaver for a few months and I have heard the sound change from good to bad in a short amount of time.  It is making an unusually high buzzing sound as if it is on its last leg and my husband is complaining it is not shaving that well either.  He has always used a Norelco and I bought this for his birthday and I do regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> After extensive research, I have been very pleased with the purchase of my Braun shaver. Close shaves, no major chafing, plenty of battery time, easy cleaning system, competitively priced. Overall good value. One of my better purchasing decisions.</li>
    <li> I am very curious about the ratings of this shaver system.  I&#x27;m guessing that most of the reviews are done shortly after the shaver was received and put in service.  I really wonder what people&#x27;s response are to this shaver after a period of time.  I&#x27;ve used my shaver for approximately 5 months now.  I was quite impressed at how close a shave I received when I first got it.  However, after a few months, it was taking longer and longer to shave and and the shave was getting less and less close.  I clean my unit daily, so I know it doesn&#x27;t have to do with lack of care.  After 5 months, it&#x27;s taking twice as long to shave as it did at the start--I go over my face again and again in differing directions, and the area on the left and right under my chin will only become close after a lot of abrasive shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, the differing directions required to get a close shave makes for an arduous task.  I have finally concluded after spending a lot of money on this expensive unit that I am going to return to a Philips Norelco shaver.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close over the long haul, the more natural circular shaving motion is much more effective in clearing my face in a reasonable time and without as much abrasion.  Also, I don&#x27;t have to be staring in the mirror all the time to accomplish my morning ritual.  In the end, given the reduced efficiency of the Braun over time, the Norelco and Braun shavers end up shaving about at the same level, and perhaps the Norelco even has the nod over the long haul.</li>
    <li> Works better than my previous shavers and for me that is saying a lot. I have curly whiskers which after two days growth have grown out  a quarter inch or so and have curled in.  They could be whiskers I just missed previously of new curved whiskers.  I don&#x27;t shave every day,  I am retired.  My previous shavers were the Remington and the Norelco.  They both couldn&#x27;t handle the curved whiskers a day or more after being shaved.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Love it .</li>
    <li> My husband had a bad fall and ended up in the hospital a day before we received the shaver. Upon receiving it he was able to shave during his hospital and rehab time with wonderful results.  He always preferred a different brand but is completely sold on this Braum model.  This was a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas, and despite having a skin condition that makes him break out after any shave, he was able to use this product.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco 2D razor I bought two years ago. Although I had used Norelco shavers for over 30 years, I was not happy with this one. To trim your sideburns, you had to remove the razor head and attach a separate trimming head. It was impossible to clean, and there was no travel charger. You had to stick the razor, it&#x27;s charging stand, and the separate trimmer into your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the razor broke, I decided to look at the Braun Series 7 shaver. It got excellent reviews in the Wirecutter blog and at Consumer Reports. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the cleaning system, but I saw in the manual I found on line that the trimmer was part of the razor and not a separate piece. Plus, it has a separate travel bag. This razor was also cheaper than the premium Norelco too, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is excellent. It&#x27;s the closest cleanest shave I&#x27;ve had in years. I was first afraid that there would be some pull since I hadn&#x27;t shaved in over a month, plus I had been using a rotary shaver before that. Normal experience tells me it takes a few weeks before your beard \\&quot;adjusts\\&quot; to a new razor. I used the trimmer to cut down my beard, and then shaved the rest. There was no pulling of beard hairs, and the shave was perfectly smooth. It was the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I noticed is that this vibrates quite a bit. Rotary shavers blades go around, and the shaver doesn&#x27;t really vibrate all that much. The Braun blades go back and forth and cause the shaver to vibrate a lot more than I&#x27;m use to. I could especially tell while shaving my upper lip. For a while, I thought I was going to vibrate my teeth out of my jaw. However, if this is something I have to learn to live with in order to get such a nice shave, I shall do my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is something I thought was pretty gimmicky when I first got it, but I&#x27;ve changed my mind. It does keep the razor clean. As a bonus, I don&#x27;t have to waste my time cleaning it while I&#x27;m rushing off to work. I simply push the cleaning button, and let it do its thing. The next morning, I have a nice clean shaver that gives me a beautiful shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> Gave to my husband for Christmas.  He says shaves better than any shaver he&#x27;s ever had.  According to prices of other shavers, this was reasonable, but it is still pricey.  My only &#x27;beef&#x27; with it is the loudness of the cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> Call me crazy, but I have tried this product several times and really wanted to make a series 7 shaver work for me. This shaver with the factory optifoil cartridge is garbage (2 star product at best). I went out and bough an old smart foil cartridge from ebay (blue cutting strip) and it makes the shaver work much better. Combined with aramis pre electric shave solution and this is a 4 star shave, not perfect but pretty good. Cleaning system is fantastic. That being said, I still prefer the Panasonic es8243 with billy jealousy hydroplane shave gel (easily a 5+ star shave and the best I have found, and yes I have tried them all). I have a thick beard with super sensitive skin if that helps.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my husband. He has been shaving with a Braun for over 15 years now and he will not go back to any other brand especially since the brauns come with the clean and renew system. Now he doesn&#x27;t have to remember to clean his razor, just to push the button.</li>
    <li> This is a very pleasant shopping. Discount when purchased. Razor shave and clean, with a cleaning system. Ready to recommend a friend to buy.</li>
    <li> Good item,good quality was ordered for a friend as a gift and he was extremely happy to receive such a good gift!!!</li>
    <li> It works really well. The self cleaning is very efficient and beats having to do it yourself. It does not irritate my face so that is a plus.</li>
    <li> Poor shave.&lt;br /&gt;Noise.&lt;br /&gt;Ridicules cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;You need 14 more words to rate this item,. 2 is sufficient. Avoid it.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver I have to say i was skeptical because my facial is super thick and it grows fast. with this shaver i was amazzed with how close the shave was compared to a manual razer. The reason for me switching was do to blades were costing me 12 bucks a month to this block lasting all year so its an investment. Another thing is my skin is extremely sensitive so every time i shaved i got razor bumps all over my neck. with this its almost as close and no irritation</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!  It shaves close and is great at self cleaning.  It conforms to the face and feels goo in the hand.</li>
    <li> I send it to my uncle.he is very happy.it is a good gift.if there is some problems i will reevaluate</li>
    <li> This is the second Bruan shaver that I have had its better than first one that I had, it&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> Jury&#x27;s still out, but the pros are that it is easy to use and a snap to clean.  All you have to do is insert the shaver into the holder like the picture and push a button; it goes through a on/off wash and dry cycle and is ready whenever you are for the next shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to shave with a razor and still think it gives me the best shave.  But razor shaving is a little messy and takes longer.  Although I&#x27;ve been using the Braun for only about 2 weeks, I still have a rash on the tender part of my neck from using it, even though I set the shaver to delicate.  Maybe I will get used to it over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I will continue using it because it is fast and easy; and it does a decent job of shaving my face.</li>
    <li> The boys love them!  Great dealing with this company. Work awesome!</li>
    <li> main part made in Germany, seat made in Hungary, liquid in north EU, everything makes it perfect! supereme quality. Love it!</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using electric for 30 plus years&lt;br /&gt;and this is the best!</li>
    <li> I had a 5 year old Series5 shaver that started going haywire last year where the shaver could not be turned off at low battery levels and had to be opened up to create a short circuit near the battery terminal to shut it off and I decided to give Braun one more chance after reading reviews that this shaver is actually made in Germany and not China.  The new batteries are lithium-ion unlike the NiMh in the old shaver and the 760 comes with a 60day moneyback satisfaction guarantee.  The motor is much quieter and the shave is incredibly close and fast.  Has 3 different settings depending on how tough the hair is and what area is being shaved.  Cleaning is a breeze.  I could not be happier and hopefully this lasts a few years to come.  Save the extra money over the 790 and get the 760.  They are both the same shavers.</li>
    <li> After shaving with a razor for many years, then trying and currently on my second Norelco shaver, I&#x27;ve been pleased, but not too pleased on the norelco.  The only benefit, not cuts or bleeding for the razor, but I have to go over and over with a Norelco and then sometimes even use a razor to get those hard spots.  I&#x27;ve been eyeing this unit up and saw it on sale here!  I just got it today and WOW.... I cannot remember my face been so smooth, especially under my nose!  I cannot believe how close this thing shaves, I will never look back now!  PROS: Closest shave EVER!!! Self-Cleaning NO Shaving cream  CONS: Expensive (but not really if you find it at a low price, like I did here on AMAZON!) $155 A little loud when cleaning (not a big deal, It can wait till I get home so I don&#x27;t make noise in the morning) Refills  (Just buy them here and you&#x27;ll save TONS)  BOTTOM LINE: This is worth EVERY penny and I am glad I found it on sale here!  I was skeptic after having two Noreleco rotary type shavers and they did not get the job done.  I was also worried about a close shave with the contours!  NO issues at ALL!   As a buyer I often rely on the reviews of other buyers when making my purchases. So I always try to give my honest, unbiased opinion.  If this review was helpful to you please press YES in the link below.</li>
    <li> I replaced a 4+ year old Braun 8985 \\&quot;Series 5 Pulsonic 360\\&quot; with the recently released (as of Fall of 2010) model 7-760cc-4. I&#x27;m unsure of Braun&#x27;s confusing numbering -- the \\&quot;dash 4\\&quot; designation that comes after the \\&quot;760cc\\&quot; is printed in such a way on the box that you really have to be looking for it to notice it. If you&#x27;re not a careful shopper, you may end up with the previous \\&quot;dash 3\\&quot; version with the white base. From the descriptions I&#x27;ve read, there&#x27;s not a whole lot of difference between the two versions -- expect the same shaving performance -- but again, Braun, why the unclear numbering schemes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of January 2015, I&#x27;ve been using this shaver practically daily. In that time, it&#x27;s never been \\&quot;one pass perfect,\\&quot; and actually not as smooth as previous shavers (both electric and razor), but it&#x27;s close -- and actually, good enough. What&#x27;s important to me is there are no nicks or cuts, no rash, and no mess. The battery, after all these years (and it&#x27;s constantly in the charger, unless I&#x27;m traveling), remains rock solid. I&#x27;m betting the total useful run time is shorter than when it was new, but the battery is storing enough juice that the motor runs strong. I&#x27;m not even considering a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than write a bunch more about the performance of this shaver, which is not much different than Braun shavers that came before it, and covered in hundreds of other reviews, I want to point out some of the differences from the previous 8985 and the other Braun shavers of that generation, for those of you considering replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The shaver itself is much smaller in diameter and easier / more comfortable to grip. This was easily my biggest complaint of the old Braun shavers -- the grip area was similar in cross section to a big bar of soap, and I really noticed it having switched over from a fairly slender &amp; comfortable Panasonic. The hard plastic exterior is now covered in a slightly cushy rubberized covering.  The overall ergonomics of the 760cc are imminently more hand-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The old slider switch (you know -- On &gt; lock the pivoting head &gt; trimmer pop-up) has been replaced. The new power switch is a glowing on/off push button affair. On either side of the push button are silver + and - buttons to control the shavers speed in three steps. With each change in speed, the power button glows more dimly or brightly. This, I believe, is the 3-stage \\&quot;personalization mode\\&quot; referenced in the product description. A bit bogus, I believe, unless you shave at other than full speed. In fact, their user manual recommends something to the effect of, \\&quot;leave it at the &#x27;+&#x27; (full speed) position for day to day shaving\\&quot;. Regardless, it will turn on in whichever of the three settings you turn it off in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Speaking of the pop-up trimmer, the trimmer is now disassociated with the power switch, and pops **out** from the shaver body. Its cutting surface is about half the length of the old one, i.e. very small. I&#x27;m trying to get used to it. The old trimmer took some practice to orient correctly while looking in the mirror, but in general, the shaver body itself was kept vertical. I only had to work at getting the shaver level around one axis. This new one -- jeez, it sticks out from the shaver body at a bit of at angle, and the cutting surface is arced a little like a kitchen chef&#x27;s knife, and so I&#x27;m struggling a bit to twist it three different ways to get a straight cut while looking in the mirror. Probably a bit comical to watch, and hopefully I&#x27;ll grow more accustom to it as the weeks wear on. Trimming cleanly around the ears is suddenly challenging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The pivoting head can be locked in place with a slider switch now located on the side of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The shape of the shaver, in general, is slightly banana contoured. The shaving head itself is canted inward -- not the straight \\&quot;candy bar\\&quot; approach of the older generation. Nice ergonomic change, though subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The charge indicator is no longer just an LED -- there&#x27;s now a whole clock dial type affair on the butt end of the shaver (or the top of the shaver when it&#x27;s docked in the charging base). Moving around the dial, it shows 100/80/60/40/20% charge with a separate LED underneath each number (20% flashes red). Frankly, a bit gimmicky -- especially since it fully charges in an hour. This clock face also has an LED-lit reminder icon to replace the shaving foil &amp; blade, which ought to illuminate every 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - On the topic of charging, this model uses Li-Ion battery cells vs. Nickel-Hydride in the previous version. Both have a claimed 50 minute run time, and both charged in one hour. And the old model was still running pretty strong after 4 years of continuous use. I think the real improvement here was Li-Ion provides equivalent performance in a smaller, lighter package. I don&#x27;t know whether the charge is topped off every time it is set in the base, but I&#x27;ve yet to see my battery drop into the 80% range (charge scale is graduated 100% - 80% - 60% etc.). It&#x27;s hard to be sure, since the charging LEDs go dark after 10 minutes of inactivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The base unit has changed a bit, but it still does the same old thing as before. Same Clean and Renew cartridge refills. Cartridges slide in with a little resistance now, almost as if they&#x27;re locking in place, but eh, what for?  The push-to-clean / push-to-unlock switch of yore has been replaced with a big round \\&quot;start\\&quot; button. This means the shaver is no longer physically latched into the base when cleaning. The graphics are revised (gone are the \\&quot;Eco,\\&quot; \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; and \\&quot;Intensive\\&quot; cleaning cycle indicators, replaced with icons of 1-drop, 2-drops and 3-drops of cleaning solution). There&#x27;s a \\&quot;check mark\\&quot; graphic that illuminates when the cleaning cycle is complete. Cleaning &amp; heated drying takes 35 to 45 minutes, depending on which cycle is (automatically) selected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The cleaning cycle is 1/2 as quiet as the previous model. The pump that circulates the cleaning solution is now pretty close to silent -- no more whiny squeal. But when the shaver switches on it&#x27;s as loud as it was previously, which was about as loud as the whiny squeal of the circulation pump. So, like I said, half as loud. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - An annoyance with the base unit is that it powers down after 10 minutes of inactivity. Walk away from it, and when you return, the only LED illuminated will be the one indicating the fluid level remaining in the Clean and Renew cartridge. Even the illuminated % charge indicator and the \\&quot;check mark\\&quot; LED indicating completion of the cleaning cycle go dark. Why they bothered with a \\&quot;cleaning cycle complete\\&quot; LED is beyond me if it&#x27;s only going to be lit for 10 minutes following completion of the cycle. One press of the base unit&#x27;s giant \\&quot;Start\\&quot; button will get everything glowing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The cord still can plug directly into the shaver for travel. The power connector is now a 90° plug that hugs the body of the base unit, no longer sticking straight out as it does on the older models, making it easier to set against the wall on a narrow bathroom shelf. The shaver still comes with a travel case, though it&#x27;s a zippered / soft shell deal now (in some ways a nice improvement, as long as my shaver doesn&#x27;t actually switch on while packed in my luggage). The cleaning brush has grown quite dainty -- thimble sized, you might say -- but, to counter that, this new model has better waterproofing so can more easily be rinsed out under the faucet. Although I never had a problem nor hesitation in water rinsing the old one when I took it on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Most importantly, the 760cc seems to shave about the same as the 8985 it replaced. And in the end, that&#x27;s what matters. Not quite as close as a razor, but good enough to get me through the day.&#x27;s now a whole clock dial type affair on the butt end of the shaver (or the top of the shaver when it&#x27;s docked in the charging base). Moving around the dial, it shows 100/80/60/40/20% charge with a separate LED underneath each number (20% flashes red). Frankly, a bit gimmicky -- especially since it fully charges in an hour. This clock face also has an LED-lit reminder icon to replace the shaving foil &amp; blade, which ought to illuminate every 18 months.     - On the topic of charging, this model uses Li-Ion battery cells vs. Nickel-Hydride in the previous version. Both have a claimed 50 minute run time, and both charged in one hour. And the old model was still running pretty strong after 4 years of continuous use. I think the real improvement here was Li-Ion provides equivalent performance in a smaller, lighter package. I don&#x27;t know whether the charge is topped off every time it is set in the base, but I&#x27;ve yet to see my battery drop into the 80% range (charge scale is graduated 100% - 80% - 60% etc.). It&#x27;s hard to be sure, since the charging LEDs go dark after 10 minutes of inactivity.      - The base unit has changed a bit, but it still does the same old thing as before. Same Clean and Renew cartridge refills. Cartridges slide in with a little resistance now, almost as if they&#x27;re locking in place, but eh, what for?  The push-to-clean / push-to-unlock switch of yore has been replaced with a big round \\&quot;start\\&quot; button. This means the shaver is no longer physically latched into the base when cleaning.

And in the end, that&#x27;s what matters. Not quite as close as a razor, but good enough to get me through the day.</li>
    <li> The 760cc is my 4th Braun shaver. Braun is the still the best electric shaver out there. I take blood thinner medication and I must use an electric shaver. The closenees of the shave keeps getting better with each new model. My wife thinks it&#x27;s unbelievable that an electic shave can be so close. As to complaints about the high cost, my answer is that you get what you pay for and my Braun is the Mercedes of electric shavers. One should tally up the long term cost of buying razor blades these days and you&#x27;ll find that the long term cost of a Braun is not as high as you think. When this one wears out, I will buy another one no matter how much it costs. Great engineering and great product!</li>
    <li> Easy to clean.  This cuts the hair with no tugging or pain.  Rarely have I managed to get a skin burn but it tends to only happen on the tip of my upper lip.  Sometimes has trouble cutting the hairs on my neck but other brands had the same issue.  Must be the angle the hairs comes out is tricky.</li>
    <li> Definitely not a close shave as compared to a hand held razor.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other electric razors since my goal was to replace my hand held razor.</li>
    <li> Where has this razor been all my life. No more razor burn and ingrown hairs. This razor shaves closer than a blade (for me) without the irritation and I love the auto cleaner/lubricator base. Best razor I&#x27;ve every use, worth the 200 bucks. Only had it a month so can&#x27;t rate it&#x27;s durability yet but seems to be well constructed. I find the expense of the replacement cleaner cartridges very reasonable in a multi pack and the replacable foil bladehead is claimed to last 18 months.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t shave with an electric shaver for a very long time. It was time to get back to being clean shave. I did my research and chose this model Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver, I got it thru Amazon for the best price and fast delivery. Long ago I had the 3 head crappy type, it didn&#x27;t work very well. For the past 25 years I&#x27;ve used throw aways and not shaving every day looking like Don Johnson, like I aways had a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Well not any more this shaver is fantastic, I love the pulsonic action, the self cleaning and of course the shave was great, smooth and clean. It only takes minutes to get a clean comfortable shave, I love everything about this shaver. Buying it thru Amazon was great also, great price and fast delivery. I don&#x27;t know what took me so long, now I look forward to my shave.&lt;br /&gt;Damn it feels good, and no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. So don&#x27;t you wait any longer pull the trigger and get youself one.</li>
    <li> Shaver is slightly above average but trimmer is very poor. If you have a beard you like to keep at a certain length daily, this shaver is not for you unless you want to purchase a trimmer separately. My previous Braun shaver was excellent. I have actually gone back to it with all it&#x27;s problems which are all due to age and use. It&#x27;s 18 years old! This new one is already retired to the drawer. What a shame the quality has fallen so much!</li>
    <li> When my old Remington shaver broke down, I tried a rotary shaver rather than another foil shaver.  My choice to try was the Norelco PT730 which had good reviews however I found it just made my skin way too red, especially so around the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of trying to adapt to that shaver, I gave up and moved onto this Braun 7 series and I gotta say, it is the best foil shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  The shaver is light and compact but built well and I feel it will easily last for years without any issues.  The ability to dock AND clean it is a huge plus, but be aware that these cleaning cycles may take anywhere from 32 to 43 minutes, (According to the manual) however the unit does become much cleaner than using just the included tiny brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get the docking back to recharge and wash the shaver but the coil cord can be plugged directly into the shaver as well for those who are on the road or have limited counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have not been able to find a single complaint for this great shaver.  It&#x27;s well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I went to register this product and after much fighting of the website to get to the bottom of the page, they asked for the TESA code on the shaver...which I looked real well and could not find one.&lt;br /&gt;Braun support emailed me back stating \\&quot;We&#x27;ve simplified the process and it&#x27;s no longer necessary to register your Braun shaver online. Please hold on to the original sales receipt in order to ensure warranty coverage.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strange way of doing things...but ok...no issues yet.</li>
    <li> ...there are a couple of glitches.  First, the slide to get the head off-set to shave tight corners (like under and around the nose) was difficult to make work initially, and now has failed completely.  Secondly, I have followed the on line writers who suggested using rubbing alcohol vs. their expensive fluid.  It works, and is nowhere near the cost.  Overall, it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m 75 and have an old guy&#x27;s beard, so that&#x27;s saying a lot for this razor!</li>
    <li> Having owned my last Braun Shaver for many years of good usage I didn&#x27;t think about buying any other brand when the Braun died (a bad fall left it mortally wounded).    But having bought this item thinking it was the top of the line, I am more than a little disappointed.    The shave isn&#x27;t as close or as good overall as the earlier product.     For $200+ I expected more. I didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> This Braun 760 Series 7 is a huge upgrade over the Norelco Cool Skin it replaced. I use it on my face and bald head and not only do I get great results it takes less time to do it.   The cleaner/ charger unit is outstanding and simple to use.  Another plus is this Braun does a good job on my neck. The Norelco&#x27;s main week point is that it was not as effective on the neck</li>
    <li> My husband has tried many electric razors and none satisfied him. Now that he takes a blood thinner, he can no longer use a blade razor. He loves this one- great close quick shave and the cleaner is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This item looks and feels sturdy, and looks good too. It just doesn&#x27;t shave too well. I have to go against the grain a few times to rid of all the hair. Very time consuming. After all that effort the corners and the mustache are still unshaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pity myself for not being able to return this. I just use it real quick before I shave with my gillete fusion, that way I wear my fusion blades less and get whatever I can get out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My worst $180 spent on Amazon.</li>
    <li> As a gift to farther, it looks nice.&lt;br /&gt;- Auto clean, cool function&lt;br /&gt;- charge dock, blue LED. Looks cool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how is the shaving...</li>
    <li> Have used Braun shavers for the last fifty years. This is the best design ever. Shaves very fast and very close. Cleaner works perfectly. The combination saves me a lot of time.</li>
    <li> A much improved Braun shaver compared with the prior models.  A very clean and close shave with generous battery life to boot.  I used it daily while traveling overseas for over five weeks without having to perform a single charge. Only drawback is that you must use the base system cleaner (a major drag if you plan on packing light for a trip)that comes with the kit since the interior part of the blade and foil component isn&#x27;t fully accessible with the brush that Braun provides you.</li>
    <li> This thing is super expensive and one might think after all the expense that they wouldn&#x27;t have to shell out more money but leave it to Proctor &amp; Gamble- Braun&#x27;s Owner- to find ways to milk you for money!  First you have to buy the cleaning trays which last only a month and will run you about $60 per year. Then you need a new shaving block after a year and a half which is another $50. And after shelling out all this money you will have a shaver that takes twice as long as a manual and will never shave as close or as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product- paid top dollar for it, which can&#x27;t be denied. Supposedly I was to receive a $50.OO credit, but cannot find anywhere that such bonus is available- so beware the \\&quot;credit\\&quot;. However, it arrived pretty much the very next day, and it is a quality item, so still worth considering- even though the \\&quot;rebate\\&quot; or \\&quot;credit\\&quot; advertised seems to be an illusion.</li>
    <li> the comfort grip is natural in the hand. it works very well. the self-cleaning feature is a big plus and a time saver.</li>
    <li> This Braun 7-760cc is the best electric shaver I have ever owned and that is saying something since I am 68 years old.  It really does cut as close as wet shaving.</li>
    <li> I found this shaver to be excellent!! I am really enjoying the ease of use, simplicity of cleaning, and the overall product. It has taken some time to get used to the shaver coming from a blade - but it&#x27;s been completely worth it. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have owned many electric razors over the years.  And many have been Braun&#x27;s along with many competitors models.  Of ALL the dozen or so razors, this is the best of the best.  Should you decide to purchase this razor, you will enjoy your morning shave and it&#x27;s a great way to start the day.</li>
    <li> I almost bought a Norelco. Then I saw the review on Consumer Reports. This is the best electric shaver. This will give you closest result to manual shave (with a razor). I used Norelco and Remington for 10 years and never got a smooth shave. The motor is very powerful...much much better than Norelco. You get very clean and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Great product. No issues with this seller.</li>
    <li> works wonderfully and cleans itself.</li>
    <li> I was leery of buying another rectangular shaped shaver. I had a Braun years ago and was not happy with it. Subsequently I have favored round shavers like the Norelcos. I took the plunge based on reviews and have been using this Braun for a year now.&lt;br /&gt;It is by far the best shaver I have owned, great alternative to a wet shave. It gets the difficult under the neck area easily. Removes 3 day stubble efffortlessly. I highly recommend giving this shaver a few weeks for your face to get used to it as per Braun&#x27;s recommendation. There is an adjustment period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base seems to work well to keep the shaver working at optimum clean condition. After a year it feels just like new.</li>
    <li> absolutely the best electric shaver I have ever had during the last 30 years. Excellent shave, always clean and odor free thanks to the cleaning base, and gentle on my skin.  I will never go back to norelco or multi-blade shavers. When I get my son his first shaver, it will be this Braun. It&#x27;s embarrassing to sound so enraptured about an electric shaver, but honestly, I think it&#x27;s one of the best consumer products I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> this is working very well for my son who has a visual impairment (almost blind) and has motor and cognitive handicaps as well.  he is able to manage the shaver very well and handle the simple maintenance procedures.  Yay!  He can now be clean shaven independently!</li>
    <li> Great close shave! The battery lasts forever and the daily cleaning is a nice feature. The cleaning refills last about two months a piece.</li>
    <li> Took me away from the blade and I love it! Easy to use.  Battery lasts long enough I can take it on short trips without the base.</li>
    <li> The perfect electric shaver.</li>
    <li> It took me a little bit to get everything set up, but it is pretty straight forward. The shaver works great every time I&#x27;ve used it. It took me a few uses before I figured out how to work the cleaning mode, just poke the big button in the middle after it does its scan. But it works like a charm, and like most electric shavers has a trimmer built in to it.</li>
    <li> Spent the extra $ on a &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34; for hubbies birthday.  Got it set up and it wouldn&#x27;t go through the clean cycle.  Bought more cleaning cassettes thinking it was the cause but it&#x27;s the base.&lt;br /&gt;Warning!!!! Amazon will NOT take these back because of the cleaning agent.  You have to go to Braun&#x27;s website that tells you to call one of their repair sites, which do not take Braun repairs anymore. So if you buy one make sure you keep everything, even the wire twisties because Braun won&#x27;t take back unless packed perfectly as when purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now we have an expensive vanity ornament</li>
    <li> Absolutely comply with its advertising, with me it works equal or almost equal to the foam hand razors , but with a outstanding treatment to my skin, The perception of quality jumps to your sight since you open the box, and its performance is incredible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago I was using Norelco, but since I bought my first Braun razor series 3, I was so satisfied that I will never  go back to Norelco or any other brand</li>
    <li> Excellent  performance except it is a little heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Also there is a recurring cost of purchase of cleaning fluid.&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to see long time performance.</li>
    <li> Shaver works as advertised.  I am especially impressed with how well it shaves two day growth.  It is the first electric that can satisfactorily handle my beard after two days of growth.  Cleaning/lubrication system works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this razor.  I empty shavings after each use before cleaning; this makes the cleaning solution last much longer.  I&#x27;ve also used rubbing alcohol to refill the container with great results.</li>
    <li> Managed to buy this item on sale for half price (thanks amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first electric razor I bought, and I&#x27;d have to say it works great. At first I had to get used to using it since I wasn&#x27;t used to it, and my face also had to adjust to it since I have sensitive skin, but after a few uses things have been smooth. The cleaning base works great, and the refill has lasted long.</li>
    <li> I have never been too successful at using electric shavers untill I bought this one....its gives me a smooth shave and cleans itself!&lt;br /&gt;I highly reccomend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for a couple months now, it&#x27;s amazing! I was skeptical at first, because i&#x27;ve owned foil shaver systems before, but they were not of quality. Due to this, I was not able to get down below a long stubble. I have a job in law enforcement, and I have to have a clean shaved face each and every day; this is perfect for that! I was using a regular traditional blade to shave with (one of the famous &amp;#34;5 blade&amp;#34; systems) and I think that this electric shaver does a better job! The shave that comes from this is faster, and just as close if not closer than any razor i&#x27;ve ever used. I get baby smooth each time, and the awesome docking station that comes with it is perfect for keeping it clean. I run it every other time and it&#x27;s always smelling fresh, and cutting perfectly. Great for when you get tired of having to spend so much money each month on a razor, and you just want a nice, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wants to enjoy shaving, and not have to worry about the hassle of shaving cream or the cuts and razor burn that comes from a razor. Ladies: your man will very much appreciate this as a gift!</li>
    <li> It is fast, thorough and painless. It cuts close enough to the skin to leave my face smooth. It charges in 5 minutes. Most of the reviews here are accurate, and are the reason I bought it. I don&#x27;t intend to use the cleaning system. I just rinse it under hot or warm water.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. I had the series 5 and thought it was good this is so much better its unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;The razor fits my hand like a tool something you want to use and is very comfortable. The shave itself is much much better than the 5 series,which was good this is great. The cleaning station has been improved really a step up from the old one.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very quiet compared to the 5 series and cleaning takes a lot less time.&lt;br /&gt;All in all highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my husband, but he said it is not shaving as good as the manual one... price was too high for its value,&lt;br /&gt;got refund from amazon!</li>
    <li> It works better overall than my Norelco which doesn&#x27;t shave as close and my Remington which didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Two minor criticisms:  The on/off button was hard to push at first and the moustache trimmer is hard to see when in use.&lt;br /&gt;But overall I like it  a lot.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been using them for decades. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 8 months, and have had a great experience with it. The Clean and Renew system is excellent, too. I have tried all the top shavers, including  Norelco 3D (1250X) and  Panasonic Arc 4 (LA63-S and ES LF 51A), and for my face, the Bruan beats them hands-down. I get a close, comfortable shave every time. It is louder than the Norelco, but not as loud as the Panasonic. I was hesitant about the Clean and Renew system, as I thought it might just be a gimmick, but it works very well (though it&#x27;s fairly noisy in the first part of the cleaning process), and leaves the shaver with a pleasant smell - just a bonus. I was bothered that there was no plastic cover for the foil when I got the shaver, but the protective carrying case is all you need. I traveled to three countries in Europe for three weeks recently, and I only needed to charge the shaver once a week or so, and the protective case worked perfectly. I highly recommend this shaver and cleaning system.</li>
    <li> The best shave at any price, and the cleaning system prevents build up and lubricates the blades.</li>
    <li> 2nd Braun shaver -- first one worked great for many years (with new shave heads every 1-2 years) and this one gives an even better shave.  Braun has also made improvements so that whiskers don&#x27;t fall out shaver during use.  Also nice to be able to rinse the head clean in between the recharging/cleanings, which I only need to do about once every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a Panasonic Arc electric shaver that would no longer charge. I must say that I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in the quality of the shave that this one provides. Although it has three settings for closeness, even at the third setting, it&#x27;s nowhere near as close as my 8 year old Panasonic was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can spend as much as 15 minutes using the Braun Series 7 shaver, yet despite running it across my face in all directions and multiple times, it still fails to give me a close shave. While preparing to attend a wedding, I used this shaver beforehand. Despite spending almost 20 minutes shaving in every possible direction and repeating the process an endless number of times, this shaver left my skin with noticeable stubble. It simply doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the mostly positive reviews, it would seem that this shaver works well for most people. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not one of them. My only reason for purchasing this instead of a new Panasonic shaver, was because the Panasonic shaver cleaning system is poorly designed. From experience with my old shaver, the Panasonic cleaning system seems to be designed for failure. During the course of the 8 years that I owned it, I had to replace the cleaning device 4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, at least as far as I&#x27;m concerned, despite the lousy cleaning system, the Panasonic shaver delivers a much closer shave than this one does. Granted, there&#x27;s nothing as close as a manual blade shave, but it would seem that in this day and age, someone would offer an electric shaver that is truly great. The Panasonic was good, not great. This one by comparison is lousy. One final note, the Braun customer service department is among the worst that I&#x27;ve ever dealt with. Since being bought out by Proctor and Gamble, Braun customer service has deteriorated to a level that renders it all but useless should you need to utilize it.</li>
    <li> This is the second electric Braun shaver I&#x27;ve owned and have turned other people onto them. They seem to be hands down one of the best electric shaver systems on the market and have had nothing, but praises to sing about them. The cleaning that is done makes the blade feel fresh after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only catch is you do want to make sure you still replace the blade as recommended. I&#x27;ve had a few instances where people who were turned onto the shaving system hadn&#x27;t replaced the blade in over a year and was starting to complain about the system. When replaced it was back to the performance it had when new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system can cause a false sense of blade renewal since the blade deterioration occurs over a long period of time.</li>
    <li> So bad a$$.  You need this.</li>
    <li> Bought this after I couldn&#x27;t take shaving with a blade anymore after my last electric shaver broke. It&#x27;s fine. The shave is nowhere near as close as a blade, and the battery seems to run down a bit faster than my old shaver, also a Braun, but it does the job well enough.</li>
    <li> I never considered my facial skin to be sensitive. But after using this for 2 days it feels like my face is burning all day. Don&#x27;t use this even if you have a hint that you may have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it is super hard to maneuver under your chin and other hard to reach areas because if its shape. Which means you&#x27;ll end up making several passes to get to the hair, and before long you&#x27;d have irritated the heck out of your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good old Gillette .. here I come back. Pardon me for not being loyal to you!!</li>
    <li> Products are not as good as expected,especially the switch the cleaning barrel is broken!&lt;br /&gt;You can see from my photos，This switch is concave，It has been unable to work！I didn&#x27;t like it！Why not check when you sell products？</li>
    <li> the cleaning solution smells great and fresh. close shave but not that close, cuts long beard hair with no problem.</li>
    <li> The shaver is excellent and the cleaning system works as advertised.  Yes, it is a little noisy, but not enough to be an issue.  But it is a bit disappointing to have the lock mechanism on the shaving head break within two weeks.  The razor remains functional, but why spend effort engineering a superior shaver and then take something simple and have it be so flimsy?</li>
    <li> An improvement of the previous Braun model.  I use it every day and it gives a closer shave than Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a half dozen times, but so far I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few years since I have owned an electric razor.  Mainly because of sensitive skin.  This shaver is great!  The shape/grip adds to the feel and the comfortable feeling when holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save on the electric bill, I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in until it gets low or I feel it needs cleaned.  I plan to go 3 or 4 shaves in between before running the cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A design flaw, I think is that the cleaning solution tray is not removable in between cleanings.  It even states in the manual that the cleaning solution will evaporate.  If it was removable, you could cover it up between cleanings.</li>
    <li> This shaver does an barely adequate job [not great] if you shave every  day. I find, however, that if I skip a day it will pull somewhat at the next day&#x27;s longer growth. It&#x27;s also a  necessity to use the cleaning system after every use or the shaver will pull  at my whiskers. It&#x27;s  a  high maintenance device and of course you have to keep buying the cleaning cartridges. They seem to last about a month. And now, after less than 9 months use, the shaver no longer fits smoothly into the \\&quot;clean &amp; Renew Station\\&quot;, which is the large receptacle that houses the shaver and cleaning cartridge during cleaning. It&#x27;s plastic and apparently not durable so that now I have to fiddle with the thing when inserting the shaver and even when it seems I&#x27;ve gotten the shaver to fit the contacts properly it sometimes starts and then \\&quot;unfits\\&quot; and turns off. This thing is also big and takes up a lot of counter space.  The trimmer on the shaver is virtually useless, warranting a zero rating if possible. I vacillated between giving this shaver a 1 or 2 star rating. Suffice it to say I would not buy it again and do not recommend it to anyone else.  Addendum 9/25/12:  Forgot to mention that when  you are able to finally turn on the clean &amp; renew station it makes a loud and very annoying intermittent noise for several minutes, a noise that sounds like a loud, unpleasant fog horn with a sore throat and a bad attitude [yes I know that I&#x27;m mixing metaphors here but that&#x27;s how it sounds to me]. Update 12/5/12: The shaver is now beginning to fall apart. There are two buttons that release &amp; lock the head. The other day when I placed the shaver on the counter the \\&quot;lock\\&quot; button just fell out. I didn&#x27;t bang it or drop it or jolt it in any way. It just fell out and there&#x27;s no getting it back in properly. It just won&#x27;t seat right. Folks, buy a shaver that&#x27;s less complicated and with fewer complex mechanisms.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 2 years now and have replaced the head twice so far and it still works like a champ.  I am in the military and shave every day and this does the job. Really close shave and very comfortable.  The cleaning system still works great as well.  Be sure to replace the solution regularly as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I switched to electric shavers about 15 years ago. My face was too sensitive for the blade shaving. I got the Norelco and it did fine for ten years. I really wanted a closer shave, but settled for the one this shaver gave me. I assumed they all were about the same. I was due to buy a change of blades for the shaver, and my Wife suggested to find a better shaver, \\&quot;I will get it for you, this Christmas, Honey\\&quot;. Well, Ok, how do you go about researching the best shaver, they all claim to be the best, right? \\&quot;Why would I lie, I own the Company\\&quot;, still makes me laugh, \\&quot;Who else would have a reason, better than you?\\&quot;. Well, I went to old reliable, Consumer Reports. They rated the Braun 700 series the top rated shaver by far. I thought WTF, let&#x27;s see. I ordered it, and holy smokes, it is. This shaver is faster, more powerful and gives me a closer shave then a blade. Once you understand how to use it,( I have found that most reviewers don&#x27;t take the time to understand that the new product is not like the old one, read the instructions and take your time). I read some of the comments made about this shaver, I must admit, I do not agree. This shave is FAST, just run it over your face gently maybe two passes, and you are like a babies B--t. By the way \\&quot;Honey, You bought me this shaver for Christmas, I opened it early\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the results. That&#x27;s all you really need to know, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easily the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s super-easy to use and the results are indistinguishable from a traditional safety blade shave. The battery lasts a couple weeks before it needs recharged, but I drop in the charging station once per week just to keep it topped off. I suspect the cleaning station doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;sense\\&quot; anything, but rather just makes an assumption about how dirty your shaver is by recording how long it&#x27;s been turned on since its last known cleaning. I have the station clean it once per week while it&#x27;s charging and that&#x27;s enough for me. The cleaning does an excellent job and with the solution provided in the original package the razor comes out smelling quite nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought this I read quite a few reviews about it being noisy. Unless you&#x27;re trying to stealth shave without anyone knowing the noise really isn&#x27;t an issue. The little noise it does make is well within reasonable expectations and even shaving next to my ear doesn&#x27;t make me believe otherwise. This noise is a complete non-issue and has been way overblown in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a good shaver you won&#x27;t regret buying this one.</li>
    <li> After shaving with Braun razors for nearly fifty years a decided to try the new Pulsonic Series 7-760 razor to \\&quot;upgrade the Braun 8995 I hade used for nearly four years. What a mistake! After using the Pulsonic Series 7 for three months, I have returned to the 8995 I fortunately still had. What a difference in closeness, comfort and speed of shaving. Before purchasing tghe Series 7 I had called customer service representative who had told me that the reports she had heard were that the 8995 was definitely a better razor BUT that some men still liked the Series 7. Take my advice and get the 8995. It&#x27;s definitely a better razor for the above reasons .[[ASIN:B003YJAZZE Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver]]</li>
    <li> the only drawback is you can&#x27;t use water in cleaning compartment other then that it works and feels great and cleaning needs to be done while at work otherwise its to loud for cleaning at night</li>
    <li> So far the best shaver I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth every nickel</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Cartridges a bit expensive but a really great shave.</li>
    <li> I got nice close shaves with this product. I still don&#x27;t understand the placement of the trimmer where the shaver blocks your view when trying to trim your mustache.</li>
    <li> I have used razor blades all my life but now in my late 60s decided to give electrics another try. When I tried electrics years ago I had problems with my skin feeling like it was burned after shaving. This shaver is adjustable for sensitive skin but I have found that even in the closest setting, it is very comfortable with no &#x27;burning&#x27; feeling after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the shaver system 5 stars but the cleaning system doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well. The cleaning system seems to always indicate the shaver needs to be cleaned even after running through a cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> I am 86 years old and as you can imagine i have gone through many electric shavers of differant brands.&lt;br /&gt; Without any doubt this is the best shaver I have ever used. It leaves my skin nice and smooth and no sore spots</li>
    <li> This is still my all time favorite shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year everyday and it holds up extremely well.  I do NOT use the cleaning solution daily.  More like once a week and it still works just as well.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It worked really great.  It came in the mail when it said it would and has worked for the past 3 weeks just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and always battle ingrown hairs. This has been a godsend! Nice and smooth skin with every shave ;)</li>
    <li> Arrived as stated. It was a gift so don&#x27;t have feed back. If it didn&#x27;t work I&#x27;m sure I would have heard.</li>
    <li> I have literally tried every brand and type electric shaver through my shaving life. So much, that my wife considered getting me help. My past experiences with electric shavers have been: burning facial sensations, missed hairs, ingrown hairs and not a close enough shave. Well, I can honestly say that I have found my dream shaver. This shaver literally has reduced my shaving time by 50%. Upon completion of my shave, there were no missed hairs and no post burn feel from ordinary shavers. I am utterly impressed not only by the quality of shave I received from my Braun shaver, but the overall feel and ease of use. I am no spokesman for Braun, but if you have to invest in an electric shaver, this is definitely the one. Trust me, this is coming from a guy that has used every shaver out there. Best of luck in your shaving endeavors!</li>
    <li> Braun razors are pretty good.  For the price, I&#x27;m not a huge fan.  But the shave quality is well above average.  I rarely find anyone who really loves the new ones -- most of us loved our old [insert 20 yr old shaver model here -- mine is 8500] and keep paying high prices to Braun hoping to recover that nostalgia.  Most of us are on our 3rd try and that&#x27;s annoying -- not so much because its expensive, but because we keep getting really good, but &#x27;not quite there&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if you&#x27;ve read all the glowing positive reviews and are ready to jump in...Don&#x27;t buy this one!  First, look for the 790 and see if its cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of so much positive press, the 760 is in high demand and actually sells for more than the higher model 790.  These razors are essentially identical.  The only difference is the 790 has a &#x27;Fast Clean&#x27; option.  Not a big deal but if you can get more for less, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I recommend the Panasonic Arc4.  Cheaper, and to my mind/beard, a bit better shave.  Doesn&#x27;t give you the feel and experience of the Braun which some guys really value.  But &#x27;better shave including wet/dry for less&#x27; works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PPS:  If you&#x27;re buying this as a gift, get the Braun.  Panasonic still makes everything with that lightweight, cheap feel.</li>
    <li> Requires effort to get a really close shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my hubby about 3 years ago. As long as you keep it clean and the head changed regularly, it is a great, smooth and close shave with no irritation. I even use it on my lady legs because My sensitive skin gets irritated and ingrown from razors. Ours came with a hard travel case which is great for all the traveling we do. The charger can be used on the shaver separate from the base (which is good because of our following comments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Base wore out fast. within a year the contacts had faulted and would not get a good connection for charging or cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;the pop-out shaver springs also broke within a year causing us to have to hold it shut or open while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is time consuming. the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; function and solution should be labeled \\&quot;disinfecting\\&quot; because it seems to make the hairs even more powdery and sticky causing a terrible accumulation in the base machine and shaver head. We find that removing the head after each shave and thoroughly rinsing the head and shaver before the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; function keeps it all cleaner and caused the head to last longer (is a plus since they are so expensive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;it is about 5 years old now - still shaving great - hubby travels for business and takes this along inthe hard travel case with the wall plug adapter and it is still a good unit. Threw the base away a long time ago. the wall plug charges just fine and its is easy to clean by hand.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for about 2 weeks. Its the best razor I have ever owned. Its the closest shave I have had from an electric. It very close to a razor shave, very very close. I guess the only thing missing is the razor burn. I have difficult hairs on the side/front of my neck that electrics have always had trouble shaving all of them. This razor gets them with out any trouble. Cleaning is automatic and I really like that feature. This is the smartest purchase I have made all year.</li>
    <li> I replaced an old but working Braun razor that had parts (plastic)falling off of it.  The new razor is great; the shave is quicker and closer; the cleaning/recharging system is simple.    I often travel for weeks at a time.  I wish Braun had a travel cleaning system instead of the usual brush and apply a few drops of oil.</li>
    <li> Finally had to replace my old Braun 7540 that had served me well for some 10 + years and thought I had the best shaver ever.  With the new 760, I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  I read some of the complaints and reviews before I bought this and I really don&#x27;t know why anyone had any problems unless they had purchased a lemon, in which case I hope they got a replacement ! The 760 is quiet, shaves closer than I could have expected, totally smooth with no irritation and the battery still shows 100% charge after three weeks of use !&lt;br /&gt;Having had a Braun before, I am OK with the cleaning process and having to buy the solution.  Like others have said, you just don&#x27;t have to clean it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;So buy this shaver (or any OTHER Braun) . . . you can&#x27;t go wrong !</li>
    <li> I have been using the top of the line Norelco for years, and started reading shaver reviews when it was time for a new head. This Braun got top reviews, so I decided to try it. The best news is that it delivers a really close shave. I won&#x27;t make any comparisons to blade shaving because I haven&#x27;t used blades in years -- too many nicks and cuts-- but the shave is really close. The shaver doesn&#x27;t seem to go back and forth like an old remington, as much as vibrate -- really really fast. I think that must be the secret to the system.  Cleaning is very easy: You can either use the charging/cleaning base or just turn it on and run it under hot water. The charging/cleaning base is easiest (just drop it in and push a button), but there are a couple of negatives to that approach. First, the fluid, which is an alcohol/lubricant, has a strange odor which I don&#x27;t love. Not a big deal, but that close to your nose, I could do without it. Second, the fluid is a consumable which needs to be changed about every four weeks. The stuff isn&#x27;t that cheap. I have resorted to a combination of running it under water and using the base every other shave. It&#x27;s a good compromise for me.  On the road, I like the fact that the shaver will hold its charge for at least a week, if not longer. I don&#x27;t need to drag the base or the cord around with me. The travel case is nice and small, an advantage when packing light.   While this shaver is pricey, my philosophy has always been to spend the most on stuff you use the most. Shaving certainly qualifies. I would have given 5 stars, but the cleaning/lube fluid seems like a bit of a gimick and way to generate an ongoing revenue stream for Braun. In any event, I do recommend this product wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> Bought the Braun Series 7-760cc shaver system in May. By the end of October the cleaning/charging station failed to recharge the razor.This was an expensive electric razor that does not work and they will not replace the broken parts! I will never buy Braun again and advise people to not buy their products. I was lured to buy this defective razor system by Amazon&#x27;s ad that said this was the most popular shaver.</li>
    <li> After almost a century and a half of shaving with different shavers, this is the Rolls Royce of electric shavers.  Interesting cleaning system.  My previous Braun lasted for 26 years.</li>
    <li> I brought this as a birthday gift to my hubby who shaves less frequently.  It was more like a gift to me because i always wanted to see him with a clear shave and i thought by giving this, i can see him as how i wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most of the reviews said, it works so good on his face. It shaves so neatly and quickly, but when it comes to the neck, it takes a lot of time and it does not provide a good shave. I can see some hairs on his neck. With the price thats paid for it, i expect it to provide a complete clean shave, which disappoints. It read that the panasonic norelco provides a clean shave on the neck whereas it lags behind in the face. I don&#x27;t think one can buy two shavers to get a complete clean look.</li>
    <li> It seemed pricey, yet it had high marks from Consumer Reports. I was amazed. It makes shaving go much quicker since you don&#x27;t have to precondition your face or clean the hair out of your shaver. Pick it up anytime, shave quickly &amp; place it in the self cleaning holster. The best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The blades last 18 months. I&#x27;m not sure how long the rinse bath cartridge last, I assume several months. Haven&#x27;t use up the original, yet.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for two weeks, and find it meets Braun claims in every respect.  It is very quiet compared to any other shavers I have owned, it is slick looking, it shaves as close as any other shaver I have had, but not as \\&quot;close as a blade\\&quot;.  The cleaning system probably costs Braun as much to produce as the shaver, and it must be responsible for the high price of the combination.  But, it does work through the cleaning, drying, lubricating, charging routine without faltering.</li>
    <li> Our son, to whom we gave this unit, reports that it is five-star.  He says that with a lot of enthusiasm, so he appears to really like it.  He has a beard that is as thick and tough as I have ever seen in any man.  If it works that well for him, it must be pretty good indeed.</li>
    <li> Great shaver ,better than philps 1150 which i used,and the price 165-50 is good too.It can work about 40 minute per charge,less than it description,but still long enough.</li>
    <li> My husband loves loves LOVES this razor.  He has always used another brand and was hesitant to try the Braun.  But after one shave he can&#x27;t believe the difference.  He always had a problem getting a close shave  under his chin and neck area but this razor does the job.  Also likes the idea of not having to clean it.  He believes it was well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I received a very close shave.Loved the style and easy operation. Face was a little raw after a shave but I guess that is the price you pay for a close shave. Iam very pleased with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Being that I have extremely sensitive skin, I looked at a ton of reviews on shavers before I decided on the Braun 7 Series Shaver.  I absolutely can not believe how well it shaves with no skin irritation, even for someone with skin like mine.  The self cleaning stand is super easy to use and very convenient.  I will never use any other razor again.</li>
    <li> I have always had a braun shaver. Cut close, never a rash, self cleaning, off charge will last almost a week</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Philips Norelco for over 11 years and decided it was time to buy a new shaver when the original Ni-Cad batteries didn&#x27;t hold a charge any more. I was very satisfied with the Philips, especially considering how long it lasted, but wanted to give Braun&#x27;s automatic cleaning system a try. I was worried about how often I&#x27;d need to replace the cleaning cartridge, but I&#x27;ve been using the Braun for three months now, every other day with auto cleaning, and the cartridge still hasn&#x27;t run out. The automated cleaning works great and is hassle free. Now, I can just use the shaver and let the &amp;#34;dock&amp;#34; do all the cleaning and charging. The shaver itself works about as good as Norelco&#x27;s radial system, but in my opinion, is a bit easier to use in the neck area. The build quality of the shaver is good, too. The &amp;#34;dock&amp;#34; is a bit too plastic and &amp;#34;hollow&amp;#34;, but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the Braun electric shaver.  It really does do a great job and, if I take my time, it is as good as my Gillette blade shaver. I got the Braun thinking I would use it for the occasional quick shave and find I&#x27;m using it everyday.  Product was delivered as specified and quicker than promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for two months now and am very happy with it. It seemed to be overpriced but with it being on sale at the time and comparing to other shavers on the market I went ahead and purchased. I have used Braun shavers for many years and and have been satisfied with most of them. This is by far the best (and most expensive) shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the cleaning system every other day with great results. The cleaning fluid is still half full after the two months -- looks like I will get three months of cleaning on each CCR refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description states this was made in Germany. This is true to a point. The package I received contained the shaver made in Germany, the cleaning system unit made in Hungary, the power cord/charger made in China, and the CCR cartridge made in Ireland. All appear to be well made and work well.</li>
    <li> It is the very best electric razor I have ever owned. I do get a clean sharp shave every time I use the Braun shaver. It is worht every penny spent on the item.&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;J.Young</li>
    <li> Wonderful razor. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I got it for my best friend and he loves it.........the best product on the market ......it does the job better than all other machines........highly recommended for a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I spent a couple hundred bucks on the shaver a few years back, thinking it was gonna give me an awesome close shave with all kinds of other bonus features with it to make my morning life easier. Well, the only part of my face it did a good job at was the cheeks and the chin. It felt great on those areas, so good I kept sliding my hand over my cheeks and chin to feel the smoothness and there was no irritation.  K, on to the rest of the shave....  Every other part (jawline, neck) this razor was not good AT ALL. No matter how many different angles or passes I used it would not cut all the hair on my neck and even though it was just short or stubble hair the shaver acted more of like a hair clipper in that area leaving plenty of whisker or the same stubble that was there at the beginning. I had to use an old braun razor to shave my neck after shaving my cheeks/chin with the new one and trying like crazy but failing to get the neck done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old razor was a braun 6520, which imo had a better cutting blade (believe it or not) and the foil was way better designed to contour and reach/cut hair on all areas of my face and neck. The motor wasn&#x27;t as strong as this new one but for the reasons I just stated it got the job done, after a few passes.  So basically I can give this newer razor an A for having a strong motor but a D for its overrated, overhyped blade cutting technology and design. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all unless you oddly only have to shave your cheeks, chin, and moustache and don&#x27;t grow much neck stubble.... and have a ton of money to waste on the razor. Oh and the trimmer on this razor pops out at a side angle and is not wide enough like the older braun model shavers that popped straight up and were twice as wide making them more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the other features this razor has are gimmicky like the special cleaning system and LED lights and all that crap, not worth spending more than $5-10 on those kind of extras imo, its the shaving technology that counts, and in this case, braun has a long way to go to get back on track. I&#x27;m hoping they get it right next time, they must have used some guy with peach fuzz on his cheeks and no neck hair to test this product out on while developing it.  Go back to the 6000 series blades, trimmer, and foil design braun, only add a stronger motor! There is a reason why the 6000 braun series shavers are still selling like hotcakes on ebay used or new for $100-200 today 8 years after you foolishly decided to stop producing them! Its because unlike this new one, they were designed correctly to get an entire shave done!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I made this purchase I have been trying to find a razor that works as advertised, but I most like the fact that it stays clean after each use.</li>
    <li> My husband really enjoyed the close shave this shaver gave him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, it self-washes after each use. The liquid is stored in the base.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves his Braun shaver; he uses it just about every other morning (he&#x27;s not a super hairy guy). I like that he shaves more now, and that this product eliminates annoying regular razors &amp; shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Before, I had been shaving with a razor and foam and my skin was really irritated, all the time!  Now, with my Braun, my skin is healing and I&#x27;ve got a nice close shave every day, sometimes twice a day, I like it that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very very happy with everything about this razor.</li>
    <li> Performs as advertised</li>
    <li> For an electric, it&#x27;s pretty good. I tried a Braun 340 to replace my 10 year old Braun 700, and it was terrible. It had very little power, and would get stuck if I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a few days. This one is much more powerful, and does a very good job around the chin and nose areas. The trimmer, which broke on my old Braun, has been completely redesigned, and has worked well so far. A big plus is being able to use it in the shower, as it helps speed up my morning routine. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade though; I still feel a little roughness even after shaving on the highest setting.</li>
    <li> Hi, This shaver is the only electric shaver I would ever consider purchasing. It far exceeds all other brands. You have a loyal customer for life. Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Joel</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever used and have been through every type and brand at this point. Highly recommend. Lasts about 18 months before you have to replace the foil and they tell you that too.</li>
    <li> I use Braun shavers since first day when I start shaving. At the beginning I started with my dads 1ser shaver, without his permission. Btw it&#x27;s already 15 year old and still works perfect. After I bought my own 5 series, used it for 6 year. Later tried previous models of 7 Series and now own this one. All of them were perfect for me and still work without break, but this one is absolutely different. I love it from first shave. It&#x27;s high quality product, works much quietly. With this shaver you can enjoy with your shaving. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Snags alot</li>
    <li> My husband was very pleased with this product and says that&lt;br /&gt;it is a great improvement over his other shaver.</li>
    <li> Gives an extra close shave (like a blade) and the battery lasts for a very long time before needing to be recharged.</li>
    <li> it is the best braun razer i have every used. good.&lt;br /&gt;the charger is ok for 220V in china.good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve had for cutting facial hair. The one knock I&#x27;d give it--and all other razors--is that it sometimes misses hairs around the bottom of the neck and the area below your jaw joints. With enough passes it gets it all though.</li>
    <li> This Shaving System is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I never thought that a shaving system could be that good and jentle.&lt;br /&gt;I had an older broun system and tryed a philips new one, and both are not even close to this one.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver performs better than I expected. I have thick course facial hair and it mows down 2-3 days of growth easily. The automatic cleaner makes things simple and neat.</li>
    <li> Great shaver- took a while for my beard to get adjusted to a different shaver, but, it&#x27;s a great system.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I got the best shave I have ever had from an electric from this Braun System 7.  Two shaves in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before it failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halfway through my third shave using it it began grinding and shaking as though it was trying to self-destruct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Braun is willing to help!  If I ship it from my home north of Dallas, TX to their nearest repair center - in San Francisco California - at my expense, they will look at it, and maybe fix it and send it back. Sometime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$190 (w/tax &amp; shipping) for two shaves.  What a deal!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Gives a very close fast shave.  I don&#x27;t use the liquid cleaner because I travel a lot</li>
    <li> By far the best Electric Razor I ever owned. Shaves very close without irritation. Self clean system works very good.</li>
    <li> The Braun 7 series is without doubt the best electric razor I have ever used.  The shave is even smoother and closer than I excpected.  I definitely would recommend this to anyone looking to buy an electrric shaver</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun shaver for several years and have been very satisfied.  I purchased this on as an well overdue upgrade to my 10(?) or so old shaver.</li>
    <li> Nice shave. Nice features. Not what I wanted to pay but definitely a precision instrument.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father in law and according to him product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I bought this electric razor because I like the convenience of a portable electric shaver, but my old one just rearranged the stubble on my face. I looked at this one because CR rated it the highest. It delivers. The shave is comfortable, and I can&#x27;t really tell the difference from a shaving creme and manual razor shave. Finally, the automated cleaning system is intriguing and fun to work with. I don&#x27;t use the cleaning system every day, even though the manual says you should, and have had no problems.</li>
    <li> I chose the rating because I&#x27;ve been reluctant to go electric after past failures, but finally went for it and I can&#x27;t imagine a better razor. It&#x27;s fast and efficient. It&#x27;s not yet as close as my wet razor but I&#x27;m ok with using it twice, daily, when necessary because it&#x27;s so fast and easy. I recommend it highly to skeptics!</li>
    <li> Replaced a older Braun with state of the art; well engineered, balance and great shave. Cleaning / charging system is easy and no mess.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and need to shave daily. This is by far the best shaver I have ever owned. Goodbye disposable razors and low grade electric razor. I did hesitate because of the price originally but do the math on what you spend between razors and shaving cream a year and this will save you money in the long run.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Cannot find any weakness, works very well, long battery time.</li>
    <li> Works great, and gets pretty close. The reason for 3 stars: I&#x27;ve had numerous Braun electric razors, and this by far is the worst as far as the cleaning system. It doesn&#x27;t get the unit anywhere close to clean, and I constantly have to brush it off once it&#x27;s &amp;#34;done.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun razors for years. I decided to replace my old one and am I glad I did. This razor shaves close as a blade and is super quiet. I am thrilled that I own this razor. I hate to shave, but with the Braun 7-760cc I dont mind it at all. Great product.</li>
    <li> The Man of the House loves this shaver...he is impressed that the machine even cleans itself! He is happy and says it was a great purchase. I did well!</li>
    <li> This is my first time I buy an electric razor, I chose this one because of its functions. It works very good, I&#x27;ve always had problems shaving every day, a lot of irritation on my neck, now it&#x27;s perfect, fast and clean.</li>
    <li> Simply love it! Needs care.</li>
    <li> My son is in the Navy and needs a GOOD shave at all times this is the BEST on the market</li>
    <li> The recharging is quieter than the former model, and seems to use less cleaning fluid.  The display feature is improved.</li>
    <li> I have been using a few different Norelco electric shavers for the past 15 years, which seem to last me about 7 or so years before I replace them. I have had my current one for about 5 years and it was in need of a new shaving head. Unfortunately Norelco had changed the way they make their new heads and the quality is not nearly as good as before and with that said, I decided to give the Braun a try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, I wish I would have changed a long time ago. It shaves much closer than my Norelco ever did, it does not require going over the same spot over and over to get those stubborn hairs, it shaves faster, and it is easier to shave (up &amp; down motion instead of small circles). I much prefer the blade head of the Braun over the Norelco for those reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: Better shave, faster shave, 3 setting control leaves the neck area with no red irradiation ever, cleaning and charging station work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: Bigger shaver in the hand, (Noreclo feels better to hold), louder than the Norelco, sounds more like trimmers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this Braun Series 7 shaver. I just hope it lasts as long as my Norelco&#x27;s did, and hope they don&#x27;t change their blade quality.</li>
    <li> I think this razor is awesome! I had a 5 series that still works and works well but I was given this for my birthday. Actually, I was first given another new razor which, I believe was a 6 series and I did not like it at all. This one has been great though. I only use the cleaning station when in needs recharged and just lean it manually in between. Very very nice!</li>
    <li> It seem to  be a great razor! The only other electric razor I have ever had is the old Norelco and this seem to be about the same for a lot less money! The only problem I have had is the 20% battery light has burned out for some reason. I don&#x27;t have a real heavy beard and it dosen&#x27;t seem to shave quite as close as the dsposable blade type razors as one might expect. But it is so much easier and faster I can live with it and just shave a couple of times a day if I want the closer shave feel through out the day.</li>
    <li> After nearly one year of use a fully recharged battery lasts two weeks between charging. This shaver replaced my old Braun that lasted about ten years and it looks like this is as good.</li>
    <li> Great shave.  Some reviews indicated that the shaver is loud, but I don&#x27;t think it is too noisy.  I&#x27;d give it 5 Stars, except it does not have a pop-up trimmer.  I missed that in my prep research.</li>
    <li> I finally gave in and bought a new shaver. I checked with consumer reports first. The Braun pulsonic shaver is all I expected it to be. It provides a smooth shave and keeping it clean is easy. The cleansing fluid lasts longer than I expected. After about 4 to 6 weeks of daily use (can&#x60;t remember how long I have had it)the fluid level is still full as indicated by a lamp on the stand. I am happy with it..</li>
    <li> Based on the package descriptions and other reviews I was expecting a lot from this shaver, and it delivered! I have used Norelcos most of my adult life and never had to many problems. Two years ago I asked my wife to spoil me for X-Mas and get me the top of the line Norelcos shaver. The shaver gave a decent shave, but I quickly realized it would not shave hair more than two days long. It has bugged me ever since and when I finally couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore I decided it was time for a change. I decided I would try a Braun to see what it could offer and I wasn&#x27;t let down. Besides spending an arm and a leg this is by far the best shaving experience I have ever had. It plowed right through 5 days of growth with no pre trimming, no tugging, and no irratation. I have yet to even get the battery below 80% and the cleaning function really cleans. After numerous shaves and skipping the cleaning I finally hit the clean button and there wasn&#x27;t one hair left inside after the automatic cleaning session. This shaver has also offered the closest electric shave I have ever experienced. I am in love with this shaver and will never look back at another Norelco again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver cuz it was top rated in a consumer publication.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for it for  a few reasons. I have a very lite beard, and it is hard to&lt;br /&gt;cut. I must press and  go over it many times. I will try it some more, but I&lt;br /&gt;have the feeling that it will not get easier Also the charging unit is large&lt;br /&gt;and bulky on my bathroom sink.If the cutting doesn&#x27;t improve, I would like return it&lt;br /&gt;I am not satisfied at all.I bought from Amazon. Good price and fast service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken nearly 10 years, countless electric razors and many uncomfortable days but I finally found the electric razor I can actually USE every day to shave my face.  Never before have I found a razor that 1) gave me a clean shave and 2) didn&#x27;t irritate my skin...at all.  It&#x27;s a small miracle and one I don&#x27;t take for granted.  Nothing worse than going through the day with a bright red, burning neck.  Those days are gone.  This razor is worth every penny.  If it ever dies (mine is a only a year old and working like new) I&#x27;ll get another one...in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers exclusively for about 5 years.  Saw many glowing reviews for this one so when my old one was finally put out to pasture I figured I&#x27;d give this one a shot.  Gave me a nice, close shave right out of the box.</li>
    <li> This Braun Series 7-760cc Shaver System replaced an older Braun shaver, and it was like going from night to day.  Granted, the old shaver was worn from lots of use, but even when it was new it was nowhere as good as the new one.  I get a completely outstanding shave in no more than 3 to 4 minutes, and with no discomfort.  The cleaning/charging stand is also very well designed and does the job quickly.  In other words, it&#x27;s GREAT, and I recommend it highly for anyone accustomed to using an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gave it as a Christmas present and he loves it. He had a braun before and this one is even better.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy after reading all the negative reviews about Braun being bought out and the quality declining, but my new 760 shaves much better than the Series 5 I had been using for the last 6 years on this 50 year old beard. I thought the Series 5 was only &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; for a shave. The Braun I had before the Series 5 seemed better than the &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;, but the 760 is much better than either of those. FYI - I don&#x27;t have the blue bar across my shaver foil as some have speculated as either &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I thought the product seemed very well made (the shaver itself, maybe not the cleaning device) and I can see why people rave about it, but it&#x27;s just not for me.  I&#x27;m a guy that has always used razors and thought maybe this would be a faster and easier way to shave.  Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t as fast as using a razor for me and definitely isn&#x27;t as close.  I will say that I have a good amount of scarring on my chin and an electric razor is nice for going over things like that and not having to worry about nicking myself.  I also found that i was able to get a close shave in those areas where I&#x27;m usually hesitant to make more than a few passes with a traditional razor.  I just found that the jawline and neck we too difficult to get a good shave and by the time that I tried every direction my neck was red.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s coincidence but my jawline broke out a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that being said I&#x27;m just saying that for me it wasn&#x27;t a good fit, but It is a well made product and if you give it the time i&#x27;m sure it could be a good product for you.  I&#x27;m a traditional razor guy and thought I could transition but i think i&#x27;ll stick to what I know.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this razor without hesitation.  It does a good job on my moderately heavy beard, without the frequent irritation that I got with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Good ergonomics.  The plastic does not feel cheap, and it fits my hand well.&lt;br /&gt;* Rugged.  My unit has survived an inadvertent drop test without a scratch.&lt;br /&gt;* Inexpensive to use.  I was originally concerned that the refill cartridges would be an achille&#x27;s heel of this unit, but each cartridge lasts for months.  I run the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; function about twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;* Sips power.  I just got back from a month of travel, during which I used the razor nearly every day.  I did not charge it, and I only cleaned it by removing the head and tapping out loose hairs / hair dust.  It reports the charge level is at about 50% now, and it&#x27;s running perfectly.  I&#x27;ll never bother bringing the power cord on trips again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Hard to think of any.  The OCD part of my brain wishes the razor stuck straight up in its cradle, rather than at a 15 degree angle?  Seriously, this is a great unit.</li>
    <li> never thought I would spend this much on a razor.  Lately, all the razors I have bought have not worked well and failed in less than a year.  Years before, razors used to work quite well and lasted for years for around $30.00.  I guess they have intentionally made them cheap so that you have to step up to these expensive ones to get results.  Well, so far so good.  I get a good shave and the product is still working.  Just wish I could have gotten the same results cheaper like I used to.</li>
    <li> I chose a Braun electric razor since I have used them exclusively for many years and have been very satisfied with the quality of shave from them.  I was somewhat hesitant about buying a razor with its own cleaning system, but since now owning the 7-760cc razor I am extremely satisified how it basically cleans itself and is much lower maintenance than previous models.  The shave is close and I found the razor to be much quiter than previous models.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend the prodcuct.  The charging station makes it easy to charge and the cleaning feature is an added bonus.  Much better than my previous electric razor!</li>
    <li> I have been using this 760cc for a couple months now and it has given me the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had. Before purchasing this I had tried a couple other electric shavers only to have terrible skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then went to using some special single blade razors along with several quite expensive shaving gels and aftershaves. While that was a great improvement the cost per month was quite high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have the Braun 760cc I can simply use a cheap readily available aftershave. Now, provided this shaver lasts a while (I think it will as it seems like a high quality shaver), it should easily pay off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to top it off there&#x27;s even less irritation using this shaver then what I had using single blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I occassionally will still use a single bladed razor to touch up a few stubborn, hard to get hairs but I still consider it a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first week or two I used it I did have a slight irritation reaction but once I got over the \\&quot;break-in period\\&quot;, and learned to not apply too much pressure the irritation virtually dissappeared....something I can&#x27;t say of previous shavers and razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, All in all I&#x27;m very happy and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives an excellent shave without irritation. Recharging and cleaning it is easy and relatively quick. I liked the first one I got enough to get another one for traveling and to keep in the spare bathroom.</li>
    <li> easy purchase thanks for the service, your product works as advertised and looks and works well. I will make future purchase with complete confidence.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, is fast, have many functions and I love auto wash function, perfect when you don&#x27;t have extra time</li>
    <li> This item is a great deal. and performs great. just wished that the it gave a closer shave but the definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older model with this one.  Works great, keeps a charge a long time, cleaning feature is nice (my last model didn&#x27;t have that).  In particular, cuts through the stubble more easily than the old one.  That might be because the old one was worn out, but it seemed better to upgrade than to buy expensive (and sometimes off spec?) replacement foils and cutters for the old one.  Easier to hold than the older models too.  Good purchase so far.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I previously owned the 3 series. It finally wore out after 6 years. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the 7 series. The new gauge that tells you how much charge is left is an awesome feature for when I go out of town for a few days.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to replace by Braun Series 5 (model 8995) that failed to hold a charge, then would not operate even when plugged in after about 6+ years of use.  I figured it was time to upgrade to a newer model.  I do love the auto-cleaning function.  The only knocks against this unit - my old 8996 had a pop up cutter that you could use to trim sideburns or around your ears.  This model does not have this.  My 8995 also had an LCD display; only the more expensive model has that feature.  These are minor issues, but it is a shame that only the most expensive current model has the same features as the model I purchased in 2006; otherwise this gets 5 stars.  It still cuts very well and gives me an effortless smooth shave.  After about 6 months of use, I am happy I went with a Braun product again.</li>
    <li> My last Braun shaver lasted 7 years. Great Brand, and I like the way this shaves. I use it on my head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m confused as to all the positive reviews for this.  I found myself spending more time going over my face and neck again and again trying to get everything than if I would have taken the time to lather up and use an actual razor.  My beard grows in a little faster than average and about as &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; as average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the lack of close shave, I personally get bad deep oily (never ending) acne irritation (as a 33 yr old male) from either the metal or the cleaning solution.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I should have changed the blades out?  Perhaps I should be ignored since the acne is my own personal problem.  But I can tell you, that as annoying as actual razors/lather are, I&#x27;ve gone back to them as opposed to dealing with the cleaning solution refills, irritation and time spent on this thing.  I will try the best &amp;#34;rotary&amp;#34; (non -foil) ) style next in hopes of replacing my ridiculous razors, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.</li>
    <li> very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and has performed well.</li>
    <li> Product quality, functionality and delivery as advertised. Don&#x27;t waste your money on purchasing the cleaning solution. Soap and warm water work fine.</li>
    <li> Works fine cuts good. easy to travel with hold a great charge. I have bought 3 over the years. Will by a 4th</li>
    <li> Shaves closely and more rapidly than my current Norelco. Yes, you need to purchase the cleaning cartridges, but I find the convenience worth it -- clean shaver every day!</li>
    <li> Finally, a Braun shaver that is still made in Germany. I had to double check the packaging to make sure!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Braun because of its 60 day &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; period.  In the past I have had very little success with electric razors of all types. I recently started sporting the &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; hairstyle and the straight razor was too irritating to my head. After researching products I decided on the Braun. Thus far I have been extremely satisfied.  The recommendations are to try the razor for 60 days to allow your skin to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to the experience. For me, I have not had to adjust to anything. The razor has provided an excellent experience, and set on the most aggressive shave setting is not too bad for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to get used to &amp;#34;taking care&amp;#34; of the razor as I am used to the disposable razor convenience. Thus far, it seems Braun has made the experience as enjoyable as possible. My one concern will be that of the cost of the cleaning solution that seems to have to be purchased on a monthly, and in the least every other month basis. Fortunately, the trial period is long enough for me to decide on this benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, exceptionally pleased with the product at this point. Time will tell regarding the long-term experience.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband as a birthday present and he says it&#x27;s the best electric razor he has ever owned.</li>
    <li> Have used a couple different electric shavers in the past. They always burned my neck. This Braun is great, I love it, great close shave and easy-to-use easy to clean. And no razor burn on the neck</li>
    <li> Shaver cuts well  and the cleaner does a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;Side burn trimmer leaves a bit to be desired -does not cut quite as well as my old Braun model from 15 years ago.</li>
    <li> my hubby uses this but still goes back to his older cheaper razor just to get a closer and cleaner shave.</li>
    <li> Looked around a lot to replace current razor.  This one had good reviews so decided to spend the extra money on this one and don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Much better than older models, especially for beards like mine that run in multiple directions. Much quieter and more powerful. The problem is that the shaver heads are getting more expensive and are of lower quality and don&#x27;t last as long as they used to last.</li>
    <li> I like it!&lt;br /&gt;I wonder that after I charged first time I use it for more than one month.&lt;br /&gt;And It is really pretty clean.&lt;br /&gt;but it doesn&#x27;t have the small cuter for longer beard cutting.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am not giving the 4 star rating is the cleaning system.  greedy Braun wants us to spend money on all the cleaning pods.  When mine gets low, I just top it off with 91% rubbing alcohol solution, and it will keep going for a few more uses until it fills up with hair.  Another thing you can do to reduce hair build up is wet your face, then apply shaving cream as if using a straight razor, then wet braun blade and shave with this shaver like normal, when your done remove blade and rinse off, then put back into holder and clean like normal, it will keep it sharp and clean and reduce hair buildup in cleaner system, and your face has the benefit of using shaving cream which reduces razor burn and bumps</li>
    <li> Well built, solid shaver which gives a very close shave for an electric razor, great for sensitive skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product, good delivery and good price. Love the feel of the electric shaver and no cuts or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;Love the self charging cleaner base.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, since I have sensitive skin, curly and coarse hair. I&#x27;ve used the shaver about 10 times and I have to say I am impressed with the performance. The one thing I did notice and it&#x27;s not much of the products fault is that I have to make several passes to ensure it cuts all my facial hairs. I didn&#x27;t make a big deal about it, because even with a disposable razor, I have to make several passes as well. (my facial hairs grow in all directions) I also enjoy the anti-bactrial cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I shaved with a disposable razor, I am unable to shave for another 4 days minimal without doing damage to my face. However, with the Braun 760 shaver system. I can shave everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For men with sensitive skin and suffer from razor bumps, irritated skin and ingrown hairs. This is a product you should look into. Glad I purchased the razor!</li>
    <li> This unit replaced an earlier version.  Very satisfied with power, battery life, status indicators,closeness and quality of shave.  It seems to leave more unused cleaning solution than older model.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the razor. The price was expensive after adding the CDN. $ exchange.</li>
    <li> My new razor is quiet. It shaves close and comfortable. What else can you ask for. It cleans itself and the vendor sent it promptly and without breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Customer</li>
    <li> My boyfriend says this is the best razor he has ever had! I also love how easy it is to replace the cleaning cartridges. It is self-cleaning and works great!</li>
    <li> I have used various Philips shavers in the past, including the top-of-the-line SensoTouch 3D. This shaver gives a shave that is at least as smooth and close, but with much less irritation (even compared to shaving wet with SensoTouch 3D) and no bleeding. I also love the Clean &amp; Renew System, especially because it disinfects the shaver with alcohol after each use and leaves a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is impeccable, unlike the constantly deteriorating quality of Philips shavers and trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts because the shave is not as close in all areas and I still need to finish my neck with a razor. Furthermore, you can&#x27;t shave wet with this model (which is ironic because the shaver is waterproof - in fact some people do shave wet with it). Nevertheless, the dry shave is comfortable enough that I probably wouldn&#x27;t have shaved wet anyway.</li>
    <li> This razor replaced an old 5 series that fell apart from abuse. Shave quality is typical of my experience with Braun products: excellent. Quiet and easy to handle. Shaver doesn&#x27;t have pop up trimmer, if that is a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> This is probably the 3rd Braun shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in the last 15 years.  You might ask that if the quality is so good, why is this the 3rd one I&#x27;ve purchased.  Well as my sons get old enough to shave the Braun shaver normally disappears from my bathroom area and finds it&#x27;s way to their rooms.  Oh well, I just upscale to the newest model so it&#x27;s a win win.</li>
    <li> I had my prior series 7 for nearly 8 years before it took a dump. I&#x27;m pleased to say that my new series 7 is much nicer than my prior model. I hope this 760cc will last at least as long as my last one.</li>
    <li> The best shave I have ever owned, I can go all weekend without shaving and this shaver can handle it with no problem. Cut my shaving time in half and the shave is closer than I have ever been able to get with an electric razor</li>
    <li> I actually thought I was buying the next level down - 5 Series? I am so glad I ended up with this shaver. I LOVE IT and look forward to each shave!</li>
    <li> The shaver is great! Many improvements over my old model which finally quit after years of service. Shaver heads are much improved and provide a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> It is much better then my old one, a very smooth shave.  The button to start it far surpasses the old system.</li>
    <li> I have always used electronic shavers all my life.  Being the frugal person I am, I never felt comfortable spending more than $100 on a shaver.  My previous shaver was the Braun Series 3 (which also had a cleaning system), and I had it for about 5+ years.&lt;br /&gt;I frequently bought the cleaning cartridges and replacement blades when needed.  But for years it would always take me 45-60 minutes to shave, which you would probably agree is way too long.&lt;br /&gt;So it was time to bite the bullet, and spend more than $100 to get a better one, under Consumer Report&#x27;s rating of this product, I decided to this shaver at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d admit when I first got it, I decided to try it out immediately, I&#x27;d honestly say I was existing it to be better.&lt;br /&gt;But now that I have had it for 6 months, I can honestly say that I really do like it, my shaving time is now down to about 15-20 minutes, and is much more effective.  I don&#x27;t regret my purchase one bit, other than I wish I bought it years ago.</li>
    <li> I researched electric shavers before I decided on which one to buy for my husband.  I thought that this shaver sounded like he would get a closer shave but it&#x27;s really not that great.  Maybe he&#x27;s just used to using the razor so it doesn&#x27;t compare to that kind of shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after a friend recommended it. Shaving is one of his least favorite things to do. After having the Braun .... theres no more complaining at our house!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried electric shavers in the past and have always gone back to blades to get a close shave. This product gives a blade close shave and the self cleaning feature is fabulous.</li>
    <li> I used to have a braun and hated it so I have been scared to try another one but could not be happier!</li>
    <li> My husband and I are on different sleep schedules by a few hours.  He needed a good electric razor since we are grown ups now and his old one is from early college days.  I read great things about this and bought it without hesitation.  My husband absolutely adores this razor and says the shave is ridiculously close.  No 5 o&#x27;clock shadow either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay.. the downside.  It is loud.  So very loud.  When he sticks his razor in for cleaning mode it sounds like someone is cutting the lawn in my bathroom.  That&#x27;s through a door, too!  I have literally grabbed the razor (at 5:30am) and unplugged it.  He&#x27;s lucky I have not flat out broken it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a word of advice… shave in the morning, but wait til you get home at night to put it into clean mode.  Especially if your wife sleeps in 3-4 hours later than you.  That is if you want a happy wife.  Hey man… happy wife, happy life.  You do the math!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order from Amazon if you just want to try it out. Because it comes with a liquid they won&#x27;t accept returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never got the close shave that I&#x27;d like with this. So I just use from time to time for quick shaves.</li>
    <li> I was a blade guy because my face could never get used to electric razors, starting with the old Schick Flexomatic (sorry Mark Spitz).  So that dates me...  I occasionally  tried an electric - my Dad had many Brauns in the 80s and 90s that just ate my skin literally.  Six years ago, I started traveling more frequently and thanks to the TSA, I couldn&#x27;t bring but a small amount of shaving cream with me.  At that point, I tried a Norelco razor and stuck with it.  It did not eat my face and the shave was acceptable, but not up to the blade standard.&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, Costco was having a sale on one of the Braun Series 7 razors.  It seemed like a decent deal and the cost of frequent blade changes with the Norelco (2+ per year) made for a short payback period, so I decided to try the Braun.  I checked the Amazon site and found that I could get a better model (760 vs. 740) with the cleaning station for just $12 more, so I pulled the trigger, hoping that the rave reviews about smooth shaving and no irritation would apply to my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word, they did.  I had zero irritation from the get-go and I really like the razor.  I don&#x27;t find the pop up trimmer to be any different than others I have used.  There are three settings for shaving intensity and I have been able to use the most intense setting with no issues whatsoever.  The only unresolved item is whether I will get the advertised 18 months out of the blade/foil cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 05/14/2014 - After a couple months, I can only underscore what I wrote above - this is the best electric shaver I have ever used.  The shave is close and I find it to be more comfortable than any other electric shaver I have ever used.  This is a no-brainer!</li>
    <li> Shaves good.  Quiet.  I am happy that I was able to find it, order and be back to getting a close shave.</li>
    <li> My husband owns this Braun as does my son, they&#x27;ve said it&#x27;s the best shaver they&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s shaves close and smooth and literally cleans itself. If you change the cartridge once a month and the head every year and a half this will last forever. It even indicates to you when you should do this. We travel and the charge lasts well over a week with no problem. They give you a travel case too. I purchased this one for my sight impaired 84 year old Dad and it makes shaving a breeze for him. He shaves and places the razor in the cleaning unit and he&#x27;s done.  I highly recommend this to everyone, it&#x27;s German engineering at its best!</li>
    <li> I had the Braun Series 5 which lasted me several years, so when the switch failed I looked for a good deal on the same brand.  This Series 7 does a good job of shaving but I gave it only 4 of 5 stars for two reasons.  1) if you are shaving with a mustache, the hairs seem to get caught in the sides of the blades and it pulls on them. Ouch!  2) the trimmer opens up like a door in front of the shaver, and if you are looking in a mirror, it blocks the view of exactly what you are shaving.  You have to move to one side to peek in to assure you are shaving the right areas.  Once you get used to it, it is ok but still slightly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;The older shaver had the trimmer close in to the shaver so there was no blockage in a mirror.  They probably lost the engineer who designed the Series 5 and made the argument to keep the trimmer close to the shaver.  So when the re-designed the Series 7, they made an old mistake.  Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the shave.</li>
    <li> It is a nice improvement over last model I had for over three years.Finally did trimmer started to fail so I needed to replace.I have to say that the Braun improved the technology offer similar shaver that I had before and this one gets all the hair under the chin and neck much easier and very cleanly.I only use the cleaning cartridge once a week on Sunday and after usage I like it carefully back so the alcohol doesn&#x27;t evaporate. This way the cartridge lasts for many months.Also every time I reverse that direction off the screen once a week.</li>
    <li> If you are considering an upgrade to your electric shaver and have the Braun 5 series or any other electric shaver I can assure you that you will not be disappointed with this shaver. It is much more advanced than Braun&#x27;s 5 series and gives an excellent shave in half the time. I am not a huge fan of the cleaning system but that is because of the added cost and I see no reason I cannot just clean this myself; however, it is more difficult to clean than the 5 series. Still, this is not a enough to prevent me from giving this product 5 stars and I intend, as I have, to use the cleaning system only after several uses which will contain the costs and maintain the shaver. All in all; could not be happier to date.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with skin irritation for several years. Used to use a rotary shaver and finally made the switch. This has cleared up my skin and made a world&#x27;s worth of difference for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I&#x27;ve never tried a foil razor before I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to along those lines. I would say that this gets me less close of a shave than the rotary I had which was also worse than a straight razor. That said, this is really easy to use and I don&#x27;t mind the minuscule amount of stubble it does leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning feature is cool, but a bit loud and I still feel like I need to shake out the head of debris every week or so. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the cleaning solution evaporating on me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 02/09/2016:&lt;br /&gt;While this certainly is of quality it wasn&#x27;t for me. This ended up causing a bunch of ingrown hairs still. I switched to a double edge razor and while shaving now takes longer, it was insanely worth it for my skin. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear in forever.</li>
    <li> I really needed to retire my 10+ year old Braun, but I had a hard time parting with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t keen about all this &amp;#34;self cleaning&amp;#34; stuff and thought it would be a pain, but it&#x27;s not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is wonderful!  It&#x27;s so much quieter than my old Braun you can hardly hear it.  The grip is a little different and takes one getting used to, but the tilting head really helps get in those difficult to reach areas.  The shave is smooth and clean, and I a rely see the charge top below 100% after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the expense of the cleaning cartridges, so that remains to be seen.  However, based on their projections I should need any for a while.  I bought a four pack in anticipation of replacing them, so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great shaver and one that I am very happy with.  Braun has been my choice of shavers for many years, and they have never disappointed me.</li>
    <li> Dont have to buy new blades all the time anymore, can shave where ever I want. It gets a pretty close shave. I&#x27;ve gotten use it. I think Ill give myself a normal shave every so often though, maybe for military duty and snazzy occasions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it does what is says it does.</li>
    <li> Not as close-close as a razor but does a fine job and friendly to the face! So far so good.</li>
    <li> My hubby loved this it was a birthday present for him. He has been hinting he has been wanting an electric shaver. I did some research on top ten men shavers and this was one of the top. Amazon was the best in price too. Oh and the delivery was fast and quick within days of placing the order.  Great gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco rotary shavers all of my adult life and when my last one needed replacing I decided to explore my options.  I researched Consumer Reports review, and priced out the top performers.  The Braun come out on top of the review, and the manufacturer was also running a special $40 coupon through Amazon and some other retailers.  That put the price below the similar Norelco and Panasonic electrics, plus the replacement cost of the Braun cutting head is cheaper and less frequent.  Sold!  I was a little worried that it might take a while to for my face to adjust to this style (they say it can be 3-4 weeks) but there haven&#x27;t been any issues that way.  It could be that I&#x27;d just waited too long on my old, dull Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning / charging station is kind of big and my wife was not very happy about finding room for it on the bathroom counter.  The replacement cleaning solution can be spendy, but Amazon has good prices on 4-packs and also on Shaver Shebang replacement solution.  These are the reasons that it didn&#x27;t get 5-stars from me.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver and its great value. one of the best electric shavers I have used.</li>
    <li> Worst electric shaver I ever had.  Terrible shave.  After about two months, the shaver stopped working. Be warned, the shaver is not refundable because the cleaning solution is flammable.</li>
    <li> Wonderful gift for my husband..He loves it! Fast shipping was a nice bonus</li>
    <li> Not as well made as my last Braun shaver, but does a pretty good job</li>
    <li> very nice shaver...this is the model you want since it dries the blades after cleaning</li>
    <li> I research A LOT before buying this shaver and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!  My entire (shaving) life I used a rotary and struggled with constant razor burn on my neck no matter what I did.  Finally swapped over to this high-end micro foil and haven&#x27;t had a bit of razor burn ever since, no matter how hard I press while shaving.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so that&#x27;s why rotaries work great for some, but not for all.  I will say that the rotary shavers do pull in hairs faster cutting down on shaving time, but this micro foil 7-760cc shaves FAR closer than any (even high end) rotary shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  Also LOVE the auto cleaning system!  I only use it once a week or so and refill it w/ my own solution (look up recipe on internet)...cheaper and works great!</li>
    <li> This is my secpnd 2nd series 7. Last one lasted 4 years and had to have charger replaced once under warranty. The side burn trimmer latch broke also. Do the math $170 over 48 months or 208 weeks is still a way better deal than the weekly quad blade disposable and cream.. Even considering cost of cleaning solutions. Yes the series 7 shaves better than any triple blade on the market and I won&#x27;t even get started on the conveinence and sanitary concerns. Much easier on the face day after day, year after year and decade after&lt;br /&gt;decade. Now for the new one.&lt;br /&gt;The new one is black,very cool, much guieter during shaviimg and clening operation. Also holds longer charge when traveling and shaves as close as any 5 blade. must have something to do with the incteae dscpulsonic&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
    <li> You want close, convenient, and a reputable brand.  Score!  You get it all with the Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System.  I travel each week so the sturdy travel case is perfect for a suitcase.  Cleaning system base stays at home and I give the shaver its once a week &amp;#34;super bath&amp;#34; and that takes care of it very well when I return home.  Automatic cleaning sensor determines how much cleaning is necessary and your one touch of a button makes it all happen for you. You can also customize the closeness of your shave and it &amp;#34;remembers&amp;#34; your last setting.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY HUSBAND, WHOSE RAZOR WAS ON ITS LAST LEG.  HE LOVES, LOVES THIS RAZOR, THE SHAVE IS EXCELLLENT, IT IS EASY TO CLEAN AND IT IS EASY TO TRAVEL WITH ON BUSINESS TRIPS. IT HOLDS ITS CHARGE FOR A LONG TIME, WHICH MAKES IT EASY TO TAKE ON SHORT TRIPS, TOO.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific electronic razor - at least a few steps up from the last self-cleaning Braun. Well worth the $$$.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my old Braun Series 7 (10 years old). The old one was working only from cable, because after 10 years the battery died completely. This new one is kinda the same. I mean, I don&#x27;t see any major improvements in shaving quality. Said that, I must admit that the old one was very good (that&#x27;s why I used it for 10 years). The one major improvement is that I can wash it now with water.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in a good time. It was well packed and it is a high quality shaver. My husband is very happy with this gift.</li>
    <li> I recently upgraded to this razor from a Norelco. I think the cut on this razor is closer than any other electric razor I&#x27;ve tried. Supposedly you need to replace the blade every year or two but from my experience that&#x27;s an over estimate. I&#x27;m sure it has to do with how thick your beard is, but I get a very clean close shave and my blades are almost 3 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that the description of this razor leaves out is its popout side burn trimmer. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because I didn&#x27;t think it included this feature. As it turns out its a very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the variable speed of this razor. When I&#x27;m shaving more sensitive areas like my neck I slow down the blade to avoid razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because of the cost of the consumables, specifically the cleaning solvent. I mean I like the razor after its been cleaned and I think it&#x27;s a clever way to clean the blade with minimal hassle. Unfortunately you have to buy the refills from Braun and they aren&#x27;t exactly cheap. Since part of the solvent is an alcohol it evaporates even if you&#x27;re not using it. I&#x27;ve started cleaning it about once every 9-14 days. That&#x27;s about how often I have to charge the razor so I clean the razor at the same time. I also keep the cap for the cleaning solvent so when I&#x27;m done cleaning it I cap it and put it back on the shelf. With this approach the solvent lasts for almost a year.</li>
    <li> Got it for my boyfriend as a gift &amp;&amp; he loves it.</li>
    <li> this things pretty good, although the earlier model I had gave a slightly more closer shave and didn&#x27;t get the tug feeling</li>
    <li> About to approach the beginning of the third year of use with no problems.  I have changed heads twice, about once a year, seems correct usage to me.  The battery charge has sufficient to take on vacations without the charger base burning carried along, too.  The shaving results are pleasing to my wife, enough said. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;The best Braun had to offer so far in comparason to other products.&lt;br /&gt;The power and shave is very close and smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and I love using it.  It does an excellent job even with my sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t break out in little bumps on my neck anymore.  I would definitely recommend this and buy it again.</li>
    <li> This shaver is nowhere near as good as any of the Panasonic shavers. I would say that people that rate this item highly have never tried Panasonic shavers. Braun used to be a good brand. But now they just manufacture overpriced poorly designed products.</li>
    <li> I like this razor and excellent design.  I really don&#x27;t think it shave all that much closer than my old cheap electric razor from years past, but I still like this one better and amazon had a great price.  The same unit was almost double price at our local Target. It holds a charge for almost 2 months with daily use so the carry case without charging unit works perfectly for any trips I would take.  I only do a complete solution clean with every charge (not every day as recommended) that works well.  It also is better for the battery not to charge every day.  Most enjoyable razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> This particular shaver was chosen based on reviews from the internet. Braun is also a name that I am familiar with from years of photography. So far, the shaver has lived up to the excelent reviews given by others.</li>
    <li> Got it for my hubby after his old shaver died. This one does a great job, is very quiet. Very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Excelent shaver! The Best shaver i ever had. Not the cheapest shaver but worth every cent. I reccomend this model.</li>
    <li> If you want a shaver that has a station for cleaning itself, then I guess this is the razor for you - but for the price it does the same thing a regular $50 razor will do, and it still leaves hairs behind. I recommend saving you money and just getting the cheaper razor instead. No big surprises or perfect shaves with this one either.</li>
    <li> Much better than the older version of Braun shaver I had.  Working great now for several months.  The cleaning system is better than I thought as well.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This razor is far superior to my last electric Remington shaver.  If I attempted to take a long shave it would rip into my neck and seemingly take more skin than beard.  That is not the case with this Braun 7-760cc Model.  If I take the time to get a close shave it does very well, about the same as I would get with mach3 turbo blades but without the occasional bleeding episode, which cannot happen now as I am on blood thinners.  This is my first premium razor and it gets 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> After years of using a Remington Shaver, I decided to switch when Remington opted to discontinue the line I enjoyed.  This Braun 760 is much the same only quieter, takes longer to shave and certainly different to clean.  I&#x27;m not sold on the emersion method of cleaning so I still tap and brush it clean.  Travelling is more difficult with that emersion tank and parts and maintenance are not as accessible.  I&#x27;m early on the learning curve so will try it for a while longer to see how I can improve the results.</li>
    <li> Expensive razor, but well worth the price.  The Braun series 7 is especially effective in the hard to shave areas- around the neck and under the chin. Of course the expense will be on-going with the necessary purchase of the proprietary refill cleaning cartridges which if used to clean the razor everyday, last a month.  I suggest cleaning after two days of use and thus doubling the cartridge time.  The noise of the cleaning doesn&#x27;t bother me counter to what others have written.  The trimmer is a very nice effective addition.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and he loves it! It gives a great quality close shave for an electric shaver and the self cleaning mode does a fantastic job of cleaning all of the hair out of the blades. It holds a charge very well also. I would definitely recommend this for anybody who is sick of replacing shavers yearly.</li>
    <li> An excellent shaver, bought to replace a Braun 3 series (I think) that has lasted more than 10 years! Our only gripe is that like many items, it couldn&#x27;t be shipped to us in AK. Last time I checked, we were one of the 50 United States...how can it be to get stuff up here?</li>
    <li> Very easy to handle. The closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor. Not as close as a blade, but the next best thing.</li>
    <li> This was a significant upgrade from the ES8243A Panasonic I had been using. Yes, it was nearly twice the price of the Panasonic, but it shaves closer, is MUCH quieter, and is comfortable and balanced to hold. I really like the cleaning station. I think it has improved the consistency of my shaves - plus it&#x27;s darn convenient. My daily shave is probably a minute shorter with the Braun.</li>
    <li> I thought my old Braun razor was good.  It lasted me over ten years.  This new one is utterly fantastic.  It makes hair disappear like magic.  You don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re shaving.  It&#x27;s like getting a face massage each time.  I keep saying the same word after each shave - unbelievable.  Worth every penny.  You deserve it!</li>
    <li> works well and arrived in a timely manner</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d tried an electric shave in the past.  Admittedly, it was a cheaper shaver, and I forget the brand, but it was a rotary, and it wasn&#x27;t enjoyable.  It also didn&#x27;t do a good job.  So I&#x27;ve been using cartridges for years now (33 years old).  So, I took a chance on this Braun Series 7-760cc, mostly based on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to say that the reviews don&#x27;t lie, and this was an incredibly enjoyable shave.  It worked right out of the box, everything was easy to figure out, and most importantly, I had my first shave.  I let my wife inspect the results, and she&#x27;s not one to like stubble, never mind a beard.  Well, her response was perfect: &amp;#34;Ooo, smooth.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean up, easy to use, works better than expected (I expected good results, but not this smooth, to be frank).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve got yourself a new customer, Braun.</li>
    <li> When the first sticker on the unit you see says &amp;#34;May take 2-3 weeks for your beard to adjust to using an electric razor,&amp;#34; It&#x27;s right. The first time I used this razor, the cut was uneven, hairs were still sticking out, and it didn&#x27;t catch everything. Unfortunately you have to walk around with a slightly imperfect shave for a week or two. Once that period has past, it works really well. Closest I&#x27;ve ever gotten to a manual razor with an electronic razor. The self cleaning charger works really well too, but takes a lot of time (like half an hour). Overall, I would recommend this product but if you&#x27;re impatient or self conscious about waiting for your beard to grow in the right way, I would say stick to a manual razor.</li>
    <li> Had a similar razor before that was 10 years old.  This is a replacement and works great...I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it much closer shave than his old braun series 5.&lt;br /&gt;They just keep improving.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work Braun</li>
    <li> Wow I had no idea how feeble my old Braun had become. It was 11 years old and still running but overdue for an update. This new Braun had  the highest rating in their 7 series, and from what I can determine is fully worthy of that rating. I would give it a 12 out of 10. Seriously this is the best razor I have ever used bar none.</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with mine - shaves as close as other Braun models I&#x27;ve owned. I almost didn&#x27;t buy it due to poor reviews about how the shave wasn&#x27;t up to Braun&#x27;s standards. I have not found this to be the case. It shaves well and it has the same feel of a quality Braun just like others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> This is the closest and most comfortable electric shaver I have used.  The extra money is definitely worth it even if you do not shave every day.</li>
    <li> I previously tried a Norelco rotary model and still got a lot of neck irritation, my main problem with shaving generally.  While the Braun 760 does not shave as close as a wet shave, it is super convenient and I can use it everyday with little to no irritation.  The cleaning system has worked well so far (about 6 weeks).</li>
    <li> This review is for Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver .&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying Braun shavers since 1972. This is the best one I got so far. I have been using the cleaning system for 1 month 15 days day and it still shows half full after each day use.</li>
    <li> I bought the Braun razor to save a little time in my morning routine.  I&#x27;d owned electric razors in the past and had disappointing results.  After several years of blade razors I decided to try another electric so I could shave on the way to work.  I researched razors in a product rating magazine.  The Braun razors were highly rated.  Although they were expensive, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shave.  The shave isn&#x27;t any quicker than blade shaving, but I can easily and safely shave while driving,  waiting at traffic lights or when I get to work.  I think if you take your time, you can get a shave that is very close to blade razor quality without the mess.  Very satisfied with the purchase!</li>
    <li> This Shaver very easy to use and comfortable on my skin. battery last longer on full charged.&lt;br /&gt;overall exellent product !!</li>
    <li> I am never using a blade again.  I was always skeptical about electric shavers-not any more. Give it a week using the electric before you make any judgements.  You do need to train the whiskers a little to egt used to the change</li>
    <li> Outstandingly close cut.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it does and I really love it.</li>
    <li> He was happy with the purchase and a great way to shop for a razor that you are replacing, the price was right.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day for work and I get a really close, comfortable shave now. I used to use similar to this then used a Norelco style that I wasn&#x27;t fond of. I switched to a regular razor for a long time but started get a lot of irritation on my neck and came back to this. I get very little irritation and none if I use an electric pre shave. The cleaning base is awesome, makes a huge difference. I clean it every three days usually and can really feel the difference. Maybe I should use the base more.</li>
    <li> Cleaning cartridges are a unnecessary expense in my opinion, but I can&#x27;t argue with the shave.  More comfortable to use than my Nerelco rotary with 8 series heads, particularly when dealing with 2-3 days of stubble.</li>
    <li> Not as close as a razor of course. But the disappointment is from how long it takes to use this electric on my neck. I wanted an electric for the speed and convenience but a razor would be just as fast. It&#x27;s not bad at all, probably the best an electric can get; it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> This replaces my last Braun shaver that lasted for 10 years.  This one seems to work even better and is definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> So I got this to replace my Braun.  I have alsays had problems finding a shaver to cut my coarse hairs without giving me razor bumps.  Many cut close but didn&#x27;t leave me with a clean smooth shave that I&#x27;d get when I used powder to save.  After reading some reviews, I got this for Christmas and it&#x27;s a dream.  It gets them all except for a few which I have to shave more patiently.  It has 3 speed settings and the biggest surprise of all...no skin irritation at all...I mean zero.  The whole cleaning mechanism is cool too but not absolutely necessary.  The manual says after a few uses it learns your face and it make daily shaving a whole lot easier...One minus, the popup trim shaver does not cut very close so I believe it is made for thicker beards and sideburns.  Not a big deal for me...</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results. I was considering buying an electric shaver for a while since I have to shave everyday and was tired of all the mess and razor burns I got using manual blades. I googled around a bit to know the pros and cons of foil and rotary blades and decided that the former suits me best. Again, as my first electric shaver, it was a shot in the dark, but it certainly hit the bullseye.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver itself feels very well built. Its head and foil cutters are really flexible, adjusting comfortably to the contours of your face. You can lock the shaving head to any position that makes it easier to shave hard to reach areas. The cleaning station looks a bit flimsy, but it serves its purpose and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with the Braun Series 7-760cc was a pleasant surprise. I got the same result than using a traditional blade - minus the mess and razor burns - in much less time, I kid you not! Seriously, believe it when they say it&#x27;s a really close shave. I was so impressed that I spent all day after my first shave feeling how smooth my skin was (and obviously getting funny looks from people around me). Of course, don&#x27;t expect it to shave a week of beard growth and have stunning results. As I said, I have to shave everyday and my beard grows rather quickly and is quite thick. For me, this shaver works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Renew system does its job as well. The station analyses how dirty the shaver is and which cleaning cycle is recommended. The cleaning process only starts if you press the button; that way you can decide whether to clean it immediately after shaving or let the shaver get a bit dirtier before pulling the trigger. Either way, all three cycles clean the shaver head throughly. It also dries and lubricates the foil cutters. It does take a bit of time to clean the cassette, that&#x27;s true, but you don&#x27;t have to stay around watching while it does its thing. Once you&#x27;re done shaving, simply leave the handheld shaver in the station and let the magic begin. I myself prefer to rinse the shaving head under hot tap water after every shave and use the Clean &amp; Renew system only once a week, making the cartridges last longer.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing: I was considering buying either the 7-760cc or the 7-790cc. Googling around I found they are practically the same, the latter having a &#x27;quick clean&#x27; function and other bells and whistles. I suggest you to go with this one, the 7-760cc, which is cheaper. You could use the extra bucks to buy some Clean &amp; Renew cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it all up, I really recommend this shaver. It was a spot on choice for daily shaving, achieving impressive results and really close shaves with no razor burns (I cannot emphasise this enough)!ving, simply leave the handheld shaver in the station and let the magic begin.

    <li> provides the best and closest shave ever according to my husband.comfortable to hold, quieter than last razor.over all satisfaction is five star</li>
    <li> Let me just state this right up front:  I hate shaving.  I despise it more than any other chore.  Or at least that&#x27;s how I felt until 3 days ago when I got my hands on this thing.  In a nutshell, this has already changed my life.  For more than 20 years, I&#x27;ve dreaded shaving because it has taken up 30 minutes of my morning routine and has left my face practically raw and bloody.  I never knew shaving didn&#x27;t HAVE to be such a monumental pain.  Turns out I had just been using the wrong shaver all my adult life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous 2 shavers were Braun 1-series devices, and both were utterly useless.  They did nothing but destroy my face.  My routine had evolved to a dry electric shave followed up by a wet razor shave to get all the hairs that the electric left behind.  When my last Braun 1 series died, I ordered the 760cc (not from Amazon) thinking \\&quot;what the hell... let&#x27;s see if spending more gets any better results.\\&quot;  I had very low expectations, based on my previous experience with the cheaper shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I got the package on Saturday, and waited until Monday to grow a decent beard for the first trial.  Man alive, was I surprised when I turned the 760cc on. It OBLITERATED my beard with absolutely zero irritation.  Whereas my old 1 series used to take 5 passes to even put a dent in my beard, this thing just plowed right through with no problems whatsoever.  I just could not believe it would be this good.  Normally, I shave as infrequently as I possibly can, but this week I had some work obligations which required me to shave on consecutive days.  That was the ultimate test for me.  I figured it&#x27;s one thing if this shaver can give a smooth shave on a 3-day-old beard where it has something to hold on to and cut, but I fully expected that it would just irritate my skin with a 1-day-old stubble.  Again:  Wrong.  I&#x27;m sitting here right now basking in the glory of a freshly-shaven face and skin that&#x27;s not actually on fire like it normally is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to myjunky old 1 series shavers, this thing is built like a tank.  That means it&#x27;s MUCH heavier and a little less comfortable to hold for long periods, but I guess it needs to have a higher capacity (and heavier) battery to drive the more powerful motor.  I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use the self-clean cycle, so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this shaver 4 stars instead of 5 because of one major annoyance.  When I first plugged it in, the lights on the base cycled for a few seconds, and never came back on.  I unplugged it and plugged it back in a couple of times and made sure the cord was connected to the base securely, but no dice.  It appeared to have just died within moments of coming out of the box for the first time.  Fortunately, I still had the cord to my old 1 series, and fortunately, the plug was the same shape and size to fit into the base.  I plugged in the old cord and everything worked fine after that.  There was some sort of defect with the cord that shipped with this thing.  If I hadn&#x27;t had my old one, I would have been majorly ticked off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for a few days, and a lot can go wrong.  I&#x27;ll keep this review up to date if my impression changes over time.</li>
    <li> I have used electric razors for years and this is the best razor I have ever used. I got the best deal from Amazon.com. Trust me spend the extra bucks and really enjoy the choir of shaving every morning. This system cleans , oils , and drys your shaver for you.</li>
    <li> I only use Braun shavers and this is the best I ever had.</li>
    <li> I was hoping when I bought this I wasn&#x27;t being fooled into it by the \\&quot;most expensive means best shaver\\&quot; ploy. Fortunately, the shaver does a very nice job and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like my previous shaver, which was a Philips Norelco SpeedXL 8175XL. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now so hopefully it keeps up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using the shaver for a about 2 months and my opinion has not changed.</li>
    <li> My second Braun self-washing shaver.  This one is even a closer shave than the last.  Works beautifully, and they&#x27;ve improved the display of how full the tank of cleaner is, and how full the battery is.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver in the hopes of retiring my blades, and I&#x27;m happy to report that I have. I&#x27;ve only owned a few other electric shavers in the past, mostly fairly cheap ones, and this shaver is far better. It may not shave as close as a blade for some people&#x27;s tastes, but in my opinion it seems to do just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included self cleaner is nice, since I always hated the chore of cleaning an electric shaver. The cleaner does a nice job and leaves the shaver smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this shaver not just on my face, but to shave body hair as well, and it performs well in this capacity too. So far, I haven&#x27;t needed to use a blade their either, though it takes a bit of time to getting accustomed in how to hold it to get the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this an easy 5 stars since it performs just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not as pleased as I hoped I would be. The issue is the closeness of the shave. Frankly it isn&#x27;t what I had anticipated. Visually the shave is fine, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as it should. Given the cost of the razor, I really don&#x27;t feel the value for the amount spent.</li>
    <li> used for the product, it&#x27;s wonderful, quiet and more power</li>
    <li> I have used Braun Products in the past.  Switched to a disk razor that I spent $100 on.  That razor ate my face for lunch.  It was the worst if my hair was longer from a few days of not shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor doesn&#x27;t care how long my hair is.  My face is shaved with ZERO irritation and I am on my way.  Cleaning is a breeze, but periodically I run the cleaning cycle and the next morning it&#x27;s like having a new electric razor right out of the box. I usually don&#x27;t review products, but his is one that I&#x27;m wondering how I&#x27;ve lived so long without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was again dependable, product came as described, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Does everything it said it would. Easy to clean and shaves well.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth Braun&#x27;s my husband has had over the years since having used blood thinners. Took awhile till I realized they could be purchased other than the one Walmart carried. I would buy the most expensive one I found. Love Amazon opening up selections. Over 60 years my husband had tried many electric shavers and discarded them. Braun is the best.</li>
    <li> Definitely the best shaver I&#x27;ve had in forty years.  The first ones I tried all those decades ago was also a Braun, but I soon switched to Panasonic because their batteries lasted twice as long as Braun&#x27;s (both in terms of shaves per charge and lifetime charges.) But Braun has caught back up and their shaving technology is unrivaled now. What I really like about this unit is that the springs for the cutters are all inside the detachable foil assembly, so in the unlikely event they ever go south, they can be replaced with a new unit.  Every part seems extremely well machined in the Series 7, I&#x27;ve had mine for over half a year now and the whole thing still looks brand new inside and out; works as well as on the day that I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was skeptical at first at the need for the mammoth charging/cleaning unit, figuring I could maintain the shaver head fine myself just by running it under hot water.  Ha! Can&#x27;t fool the Braun; no matter how good a job I think I&#x27;ve done washing out the shaver head myself, it instantly detects whatever trace of whisker might be left behind and selects the appropriate cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue was some confusion from the instructions that come with this unit, which seem to suggest that the shaver can only be used dry — says not even to wash your face before using. This struck me as odd, as this model is clearly advertised as waterproof. But I&#x27;ve had no problems shaving with my stubble wet down with a bit of isopropyl.  Much easier to shave that way, otherwise the foils can drag a bit over my skin, especially in high humidity. As the cleansing unit supplied with the kit is alcohol based, no fear of damaging the shaver this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some others have mentioned, the Series 7 comes with a travel pouch that is only large enough to hold the shaver, and not the cord.  While I do get a lot of shaves from a single charge, I still wouldn&#x27;t dream of traveling for any length of time with no way to recharge the device. Kinda trivial a complaint, and obviously no deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For overall quality, this shaving kit rules.  So glad I switched back to Braun, the Pulsonic feels built to last.ivial a complaint, and obviously no deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For overall quality, this shaving kit rules.  So glad I switched back to Braun, the Pulsonic feels built to last.</li>
    <li> This model offers very precise shaving and is also very quiet. My DH absolutely loves his new shaver. Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> Two years on this shaver and I am very happy with it.  Lots of reviews with good information - the one thing I would highlight is the &amp;#34;Pulsonic&amp;#34; cleaner.  If ever there was something I thought was a gimmick - and was wrong about - this is it.  It really works.  I wait for the indicator lights to get to the third, deepest clean level, between activations.  I really notice an easier, better shave after it has gone through the clean cycle.  It really works!  Purchased the cleaning solution modules in four-pack from Amazon and have gone through one four pack in two years.  I travel on business a lot for up to two weeks at a time - I never take the charger, battery has never even come close to running low.  I had a Norelco in the past that may have had a slightly better shave - but I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this overall.</li>
    <li> The Braun 760 does a great job of shaving overall. It seems to be exceptional for the neck and  chin  areas. I have owned several Braun razors and this one works better than any of the others. The battery life is excellent and the cleaning is great. The trimmer is a little narrow and that is the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> This review is being written after only a week&#x27;s use; so please keep that in mind. The shave the Braun has given me is the closest and smoothest I have ever had (and I am 81!). That&#x27;s a very strong statement, but an accurate one. I just hope this kind of performance continues for the life of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used a rotary-type razor so I was concerned about changing to foil model. especially about possible irritation. But it was a foolish worry because the Braun was as smooth as silk and caused absolutely no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on on my limited experience (but I do not expect it will change) I would recommend this razor without reservation.</li>
    <li> My wife got tired of the razor nicks and the blood on my collars.  She went to Google and researched electric razors of all types.  This one seemed to promise the best results for the price. I does shave nearly as close as my razor, and I no longer cut myself. Yes, I recommend this razor to anyone.  By the way, I have very wavy hair and do get ingrown hairs at times.  That has not been a problem since I started using the Braun.</li>
    <li> The best in the market. We have four in my house. Love it! I would recommended a the one all must have</li>
    <li> No word can describe how this stuff works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee it shaves better than blade shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I am asian male who has a thick and uneven hairs on the face.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. I researched this razor thoroughly before buying it at amazon.com - at a greatly reduced price! . It was a gift  for my husband. He loves the razor and I love the price! I would highly recommend purchasing this product from amazon.com</li>
    <li> I have had Series 5 shavers from Braun for 15 years, or more.  They have served me well and given me a good shave every morning.  My last one finally wore out and needed to be replaced.  I took a chance and spent the extra money for the Series 7 and boy I am pleased.  The Series 7 is hands down the best shaver out there,  3 settings for skin condition, a greatly improved shaver head that doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind, and it is much quieter than the old series 5 versions.</li>
    <li> I sure don&#x27;t mind paying more for a quality product and BRAUN fits the bill. Close comfortable shaves every time. This is my second BRAUN purchase and I am completely satisfied. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Sorry, but my husband did not like anything about this shaver. He says his old shaver does a much better job than this one. We returned it this morning. The one star was for fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love the razor! I gave it a few weeks for my skin to adjust to the different razor type.  I wasn&#x27;t that impressed at first, but now it&#x27;s definitely a time-saver in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Philips Norelco 8150XL before this, and it would actually shave a bit closer.  I would never go back to that thing though...if there were ever a few longer hairs it would catch on them and pull (not a good thing if you have a goatee and want to get a close shave around it or if youre like me and don&#x27;t like to shave on weekends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways...back to the Braun. Still gives me a nice close shave, and probably better that it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as my old Norelco because I don&#x27;t get any ingrown hairs now (and it doesn&#x27;t pull if I run into longer hair). Plus the built-in trimmer is 1000x better than on the old Norelco. It has a bit of a curve to it, so that&#x27;s nice for trimming tight areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it has a Lithium-Ion battery and says that it doesn&#x27;t cause any &#x27;battery memory&#x27; issues if you recharge before it&#x27;s drained.  That was the main reason why I chose this model over the 3 or 5 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clean &amp; Renew wash system is very nice. I do notice that I get a better shave on the mornings after it has ran the cleaning cycle.  Just feels like it runs a little smoother and I don&#x27;t have to go over areas again. Not sure how expensive it&#x27;ll end up being to replace those, but I&#x27;ve had the system for about a month now and the indicator still reads as full. The book says you should clean it after every shave, and at that rate a cartridge should last 1-2 months. I run the cleaning cycle maybe every 2-6 days instead and I would imagine it will last me 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the 3 different intensity settings seemed nice at first, but once I tried all 3 I just leave it on the highest speed...cuts quicker and plows through thick stubble like nobody&#x27;s business.  I guess this could be useful for somebody with more sensitive skin or thinner facial hair, but since my skin is pretty tough and my hair is course I just leave it on high all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks great on the counter top. Almost like a piece of art how it sits offset in the base (which is a great design by the way. I wasn&#x27;t sure why they did that at first, but it&#x27;s so the cleaning solution can be gravity fed through the blades as it&#x27;s being cleaned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it doesn&#x27;t cut quite as close, and the cleaning solution could make it costly to maintain if you clean it daily. I would definitely recommend the shaver though, it feels solid and I expect it&#x27;ll last for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I bought a shavers, whose price does not justify its quality Shaver. 5 minutes after my skin became red, but still left the tip. I do not recommend to buy this.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a month and it is way better than my old 3 series. It&#x27;s a bit loud so I can&#x27;t use it early in the morning or it wakes everyone up, but the shave is close and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> This product was a gift and it received high praise for delivering what it said it would do. Have spoken with others who have one and they say the same.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for what seems like forever. My last shaver was the then-top-of-the-line 7680, which served me well for close to ten years (the battery doesn&#x27;t hold its charge the way it used to). When I decided to replace it, I eventually decided that while the differences seem small, if a product is going to serve me for so many years I might as well get the best option, and the price difference is not significant when averaged over a 5+ year period.&lt;br /&gt;When researching this category, I was looking for the water-washable models. Choosing them can significantly reduce your reliance on the (more expensive) original cleaning solution, and make the total cost lower than cheaper models. I was skeptical about the \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; part of the system (the \\&quot;microvibrations\\&quot; supposed to improve shaving efficiency), but the given the models that I had available to choose from, the 760 was the most logical choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the shaver, I was actually surprised to find that the shaving experience and results are considerably better than my older shaver (even with a new head and full power). Shaving time is down to almost half what it was, even after I miss a day of shaving. Whether this is thanks to the Pulsonic feature or not, I cannot say (as I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try a Series 5 shaver). The ability to choose shaving \\&quot;strength\\&quot; is nice, but for me it&#x27;s not a must. I certainly feel the difference in the more sensitive ares (mustache area, mainly), but probably not enough to make a point of pushing the button before and after I get to those areas. The buttons are not easy enough to find by feel, and shaving is a little slower in the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; setting, so I&#x27;m not sure about this trade-off. The water-washable feature was all I asked for: pop up the screen, run the shaver under water for a couple of seconds, and you&#x27;re done. I will not be able to go back, and it looks like I will only use the cleaner function once a month, or perhaps even less frequently(tip: if you choose to go that route, you really need to keep the cleaning solution container closed with its original cap when not in use, as it will evaporate completely after a few weeks if left open in the cleaner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks after I got the shaver, it fell on the bathroom counter from a higher shelf, and stopped working right (making louder noises and not shaving well). Since I bought it in the US, but used it abroad, I didn&#x27;t have any documentation save for the Amazon receipt (printed from the website). The local Braun lab took it in, determined there was a broken part that needs to be replaced, and did it under warranty (it looks like they practically replaced the entire \\&quot;head\\&quot;). While it took a few days longer than I expected to get the part to the lab (holiday season and all), I was really happy with the service, and very happy with the end result. Doing a relatively big replacement under warranty with \\&quot;skimpy\\&quot; evidence and no original documentation deserves special praise in this day and age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall positives:&lt;br /&gt;- Water washable.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;- Excellent service.&lt;br /&gt;- Quality feel and build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall negatives:&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving \\&quot;strength\\&quot; buttons not easily findable by touch (yes, I&#x27;m nitpicking here).&lt;br /&gt;- Higher priced than some competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this model, or any equivalent model with the water-washable feature.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shaver, but it&#x27;s simply inferior to past Braun offerings.  I have had this razor for approximately 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you a frame of reference, my old razor is a 8 year old Braun 8985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVE QUALITY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, if your facial hair is longer than 1 or 2 days growth, this thing WILL be painful and pull hair.  It&#x27;s worse than a kinky girlfriend.  It seems like to avoid the hair pulling, you MUST shave with it daily.  Do not skip days or you will feel its wrath.  This would be mitigated some if the trimmer feature actually worked, but it doesn&#x27;t (see below).  That said, the shave it offers it fairly decent.  It gives a pretty close shave (not manual razor quality, obviously, but good for an electric).  It does occasionally skip a hair or two, particularly on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the kicker.  It shaves ABOUT as well as my 8 year old Braun 8985.  I have NEVER replaced the head on that razor, not even once.  I also haven&#x27;t had the cleaning base for it for about 5 years.  I feel like a brand new nearly top of the line electric should fair better than my old model that&#x27;s never been changed and rarely cleaned.  Sadly, this is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t expect to actually be able to use the trimmer feature.  Not only is it like an inch wide, but it also does absolutely nothing, literally.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just programmed to make &#x27;hair cutting&#x27; sounds when it touches skin.  If this feature actually did anything, it might not pull as much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMFORT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh.  I literally just finished shaving with this razor and my face is killing me.  I do not have sensitive skin, nor any skin conditions.  The razor just pulls hair like crazy and it&#x27;s extremely painful.  I decided today that I could not tolerate it any longer and decided to return it and write this review.  It&#x27;s that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comfort of actually holding the razor is amazing, though.  I will miss holdingit.  The weight is perfect, as is the balance, and the soft rubberized material used on the body is pleasant to the touch.  The razor also has an ergonomic contour that is pleasing to hold.  It just fits your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVE TIME:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abysmal.  Reason being is that you become so scared of the pain you&#x27;re about to receive from the shave, you take 3 times longer than you normally would.  It shouldn&#x27;t take me 15 minutes to shave my face with an electric.  I would expect 5-7 minutes tops.  I actually had to break out my old 8985 to complete today&#x27;s shave because the pain was so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++Shaves close&lt;br /&gt;++VERY comfortable and pleasant to HOLD&lt;br /&gt;++Holds a charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;++Charges quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;--Feels like you&#x27;re shaving with a medieval torture device&lt;br /&gt;--Trimmer feature is worthless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this razor.  I loved it when I held it in the store, but it&#x27;s a razor, not a puppy.  It needs to DO something other than be held and this Braun just doesn&#x27;t perform.  I ultimately ended up returning mine and haven&#x27;t found a good enough replacement for my Braun 8985 yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to give it 2 stars because it just doesn&#x27;t do what it needs to be able to do: give a close, comfortable shave.  The pain involved with shaving with this razor, in my opinion, is bad enough to warrant the loss of 2 stars (another star off for the trimmer feature, which is important).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you shave literally every day and never use the trimmer, this razor might work out for you, but save that receipt.  And don&#x27;t expect to ever shave with it if you have more than 2 days growth.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because my Norelco was irritating my skin. This one is also, although not as bad. I hope continued use will  resolve the irritation.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend. He uses it every day and it has paid for itself over and over again already.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and does a great job without the pain or knicks.</li>
    <li> Solid does the job if you take care of it. Only issue I had was after I bought it on Amazon, I found several places where it sells for around $160.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced a Braun 800 series shaver that was almost 15 years old.  This is a great improvement over the old one even when it was new.</li>
    <li> ...And he&#x27;s very particular.  At first he was apprehensive because it looks bulky, but the bulk comes from the cleaning device that he now says is quite clever.  He loves the floating, rotating head, says it makes a great, clean shave.</li>
    <li> Works great. Haven&#x27;t used any other shavers to compare it to.</li>
    <li> It was more than what i expected. I get a clean and close shave every time. It self cleaning is awesome.</li>
    <li> old braun was better than the new one why spend that much cash for an inferior product I will not do it again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor in 20+ years and don&#x27;t remember them being this good.  Had my first electric razor been this good, I would never have gone blade.  Auto-cleaning feature is good, but I find manually taking the head off and dumping the contents to also be of benefit (head pops right off with push of a button).  Keeps a charge (never have I had an issue with this).  Trimmers work like you would think they would, good enough to get the job done and don&#x27;t pinch or bite like some do.  I was concerned that the cleaning solution would be used up quickly, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how long it lasts.  I would say I only use about a tank every 2 months when cleaning per the recommended interval set by the light on the charger.  If I were to accidentally flush this down the toilet, I would buy this product again...</li>
    <li> I few things I have to say about this product. I have thick hair, so I was a skeptical about the reviews before purchasing. I thought it might have not given me a smooth shave. To my surprise, it did better then what I had expected. It&#x27;s not entirely smooth but it&#x27;s the closest to a smooth shave I have ever gotten with an electrical shaver. I use it every other day and gave up razors for good. If there is an ever a future updated version of the Braun Series, I am already sold!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for 25 years.  All have been very good.  This shaver however is terrible.  The shaver requires multiple passes to remove beard unlike prior models.  To get good shave I must resort to touch ups with a standard blade shaver.  Save yourself some time and pick a different unit.</li>
    <li> (Update 4 July 2013)-on weekends I tend to not shave and have traditionally gone back to the razor blade Sunday night or Monday morning. This past week I opted to try this Braun instead and see how well it could do. Totally impressed. Shaved perfectly; no need to break out the razor at all. I was stunned, but very happy. Wish I could give this Braun another star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only ever had one other electric razor and it too was a Braun. However, it was a Braun purchased about 15-years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ups: cleaning system works great; very quiet operation; provides a very good shave for me - comparable to a blade; uses same cleaning cartridges as my previous Braun; cleaning cartridges appear to last longer than on previous Braun razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downs: cleaning cycle a bit noisier than expected; still misses some facial hair that likes to lie flat; power cord head too large - would be better at end nearer the base; no head cover for storage in a drawer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not been overly impressed with the results from my old Braun every since I first purchased it. As such I&#x27;ve alternated between the electric razor and a blade each day. This new model does a far superior job. I&#x27;m getting a very close shave that is also very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, have issue with facial hair that likes to curl and loop and the razor misses a handful of these each morning. Still, it&#x27;s such a marked improvement over my old one that I&#x27;ve given up the razor blade and been using only this electric one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the cleaning cartridges used to dry out very quickly when left in the base of my older razor. These aren&#x27;t cheap so I would take it out each day and replace the snap-on cover. This newer razor seems to keep the fluids less open and I&#x27;m not having the same issue with them drying out too quickly.</li>
    <li> Shaver works well, cleaning works well for about 6 months if you clean it all the time it works better.  Only issue I have with that is the expense of the cleaner.  I clean mine once a week and that works well, I then cap the cleaner so it won&#x27;t dry out and that makes it last longer.  Overall performance is good, although I love my circular blades this does a great job.</li>
    <li> I still use a safety razor when I want a really close shave, but this is the best electric that I have ever had in my 67 years.</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  Much quieter than my older model.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the older model, but it does work very well.</li>
    <li> I have used a Track 3 for many years. Every once in a while I try an electric but I always go back to the real razor. I recently had surgery and was told to quit using the razor because of the blood thinners that I was taking. Based on my son&#x27;s recommendation I bought the Braun. He claimed that it would shave as close as the real thing. It does shave better than any other electric shaver that I have tried. It still does not shave as close as a blade. After using a blade, I can rub my face against the grain and not feel any whiskers. No matter how many times I go over my face with the Braun, I can still feel the stubble. If I wait a few days between shaves, it is necessary to use a blade as the Braun has a problem with a few days growth. I will still use the Braun for a quick touch up as it is a little quicker.</li>
    <li> The only thing we&#x27;re not too thrilled about is having to buy expensive alcohol/lubricant mixes to keep the razor clean and sharp. The owner&#x27;s manual says that you can do it with regular alcohol, but have to lubricate it weekly. If I could expect my spouse to remember to lubricate the razor, I&#x27;d probably go that route. Until then, I&#x27;ll be purchasing alcohol packets monthly or so.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift, the receiver loves it, but the blades are already dull after barely 2 months, and yes it is cleaned daily per instructions.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a good shaver, but will definitely be expensive to maintain.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Could not be happier best money I ever spent no one can believe I get a shave this close with an electric razor. Amazing</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t shave every day, the vibrating mode gets the job done with less passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is not a gimmick.</li>
    <li> The razor is amazing. It shaves really good and the cleaner is a must have. Its very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I used a Braun for years then stopped. After realizing it was a mistake I bought this razor and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. I have had the razor for over a year and it still works like new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers in the past and all of them have been excellent, however, this one beats them all. Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> This electronic razor is an excellent purchase. I shave everyday, and this product makes it that much less of a hassle. It gets the job done fast, leaving a smooth feeling at the end. It maybe pricey for some but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> It did shave cleaner than my previous philips. But the noise a little bit higher than my expectation.</li>
    <li> This is much superior to the Series 5 which I was not satisfied. This shaver is very satisfactory and is recommended. The only issue is the high cost of the shaver and replacement cartridges.</li>
    <li> I thought this will be a great product.  I never used a Braun before but I regret that I brought this. it take longer time to shave also I never get a close shave.  always leaves hair on face.  lifting up flat hair does not work at all.  I have to use a razor to do final shave.  I was Norelco for 7 years which was much better.  it does better job than this Braun 7-760cc.  I only brought this bc of the lift and cut the flat hair. very disappointed on this product. It does not matter what kind of setting you have never get a close shave.</li>
    <li> really love this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this as the top of the line when my 5-6 year old previous Braun died. This one grabs and pulls on long hairs more, so the 760 gets sworn at a little more. The beard trimmer is also half the size, which makes making a long straight cut under the jaw more difficult, and it juts out at an odd angle from the middle of the handle, so the body is blocking your view of what you are trying to do. The cleaning base is a expensive nuisance, but it was cheaper to buy the razor with it than without, I guess because they make up the money getting you to buy alcohol cartridges. Lastly, the three speeds don&#x27;t make any difference in the multiple passes I have to do over my neck. I&#x27;d gladly go back to my previous, simple Braun model if it was will available.</li>
    <li> Never thought I could love a E-shaver...but this one is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love the shaver.  However after 2 years 8 months, the head lock has broken and it&#x27;s also become lose.  Not sure how much longer it will last.  Braun told me Sorry, the warranty was only for 2 years.  Now I have to just wait and see what else will break before I buy another one.  I do like it that much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned similar model Braun shavers for the past decade. This looks almost identical, but it shaves SO MUCH BETTER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This must be a higher series, better model, more powerful motor, and it certainly was a bit more costly (though I have crossed the $100 price point before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I&#x27;d say that IT IS WORTH IT! I save a lot of TIME now whenever I shave.</li>
    <li> I have had Braun razors for several years.  This one is by far the best.  It is a good shave, very quiet, and has good battery life.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have had this shaver for almost a year now and it still works great.  Great price on Amazon</li>
    <li> Cheaper Quality for &amp;#34;German Engineering&amp;#34;???  I guess everything must come to an end - Braun shavers used to have an &amp;#34;expected&amp;#34; quality.  But no longer - sounds like they don&#x27;t check the quality of Chinese manufacturing either.  The shavers are definitely made with cheap materials including the blades, BUT it still COSTS MORE or the same. They should cost about HALF the price they are being sold.  And thats a shame!</li>
    <li> I had to switch to an electric razor as I am on blood thinners. I did my research, and I purchased a Norelco 1180X. I had never tried a rotary razor and it got pretty good reviews. I was very disappointed in the Norelco. Even though this was a high end shaver (on sale for $170 bucks)the performance wasn&#x27;t very good. It left my face very irritated, took forever to shave, and most importantly, just did not provide a close feeling shave at all. I used it for 3 weeks as suggested, but never got a satisfying shave out of it. So I sent it back and I await my refund. So I decided to try this Braun 760 CC. Well, I must say this was a real surprise compared to the Norelco. Very easy to use, very quick to shave, and what a close shave indeed! It isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, how could it be? But it is much much closer than I got with the Norelco. Hands down an excellent shave. My wife couldn&#x27;t believe the difference from the Norelco to the Braun. My face is baby smooth and no red irritation. I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up over the long haul, but for quality of a shave I give it top marks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for over 10 years.  The Series 7 provides a shave as close to a blade as possible. Allows you to get those hard to get places on your neck. Great shave!</li>
    <li> I have to shave everyday and I have thick stubble.  Most electric razors cannot handle it.  This one however, shaves close and smooth.  the best electric i have ever used.</li>
    <li> The shave is very sharp with this baby, i like the auto cleaning feature although you can clean it your self if youre away from home (it brings a case for traveling).</li>
    <li> Very good overall.  Not perfect for stubborn stubble.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for ove 30 years, this is the best ever. I am really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Still shaves as well, monitor display has about 50% of the information in previous model. There are formulas available on line to make your own cleaning solution, don&#x27;t bother with Braun&#x27;s, it doesn&#x27;t do any better.</li>
    <li> I am 30 and this is my first electric shaver....never even tried one before.  Was always hesitant they would not give a close shave, but this Series 7 proved me wrong.  I usually shave at the sight of any facial hair and I hated always having to lather up and use a razor.  I kept telling myself with the money I spent on Schick Hydro razor heads In a year I could have bought an electric shaver.  Just had my first shave with the Series 7 and my skin feels good and smooth. Hope the shaver lasts awhile!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected, even better.&lt;br /&gt;I had previous 5-series Braun for 5 years without any problem, but was more noisier than the new one I bought (7-series). It has a nice style, comfortable handle, and negligible noise when it&#x27;s operating.&lt;br /&gt;Concern: still noisy when doing self cleaning</li>
    <li> One of the best electric shavers I have owned.  It gives me close shave without the burn and irritation. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Shaver performs well however cleaning mechanism totally superfluous and an expensive  gimmick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time Braun customer, and I can honestly say that I was terrified that this electric razor wouldn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. Gladly, I was wrong. Being a mixed race person, I have had trouble shaving my whole life. From irritation to razor bumps to the razor not getting all of the hairs. This product makes a damn good improvement on all of those. It is extremely comfortable to shave with, it gently massages the face and I actually look forward to shaving with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month now and the manufacturer didn&#x27;t lie when they said it takes a few weeks for your face to get used to it. Those first few shaves were a little disappointing to me, but after a while I noticed shaves were getting easier and it was cutting more hair. I don&#x27;t get any irritation WHATSOEVER and I hardly get any razor bumps at all, and the only reason I get them is because I allow my beard to grow out instead of shaving more often. I went from having a moderate amount of bumps to having 2 or 3 here and there (which are easy to remedy by using Bump Patrol and/or a tweezer). Even when you let your hair grow out, you get significantly less bumps than using a razor and letting it grow out. I HIGHLY recommend this and Bump Patrol to my curly haired brothers, it will ease your pain. There isn&#x27;t any pulling, it&#x27;s just a straight cut and the 3 different personalization modes are very convenient for certain parts of the face that require less or more power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product does have a bit of a problem sometimes cutting flat lying hair; presumably for me because of the curliness. If I allow my hair to grow out a few days worth I have to use the trimmer to cut it low and then use the head to get it shorter. If I shaved everyday I probably wouldn&#x27;t have this problem, but I&#x27;m lazy. It works well on the neck if you shave everyday or every 2 days (I shave every 2-3 days); again if you allow it to grow you will have to use the trimmer and that can be tricky on the neck. I have a small Peanut clipper and if the hair is too long on my neck I use that if the trimmer can&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why there are some people complaining about the noise. I had a small and cheap $25 Remington and it made 10x more noise. It was annoying in the morning and I worried about waking other people up. This is much quieter and so there isn&#x27;t an issue. The cleaning unit also isn&#x27;t exorbitantly loud and when I need a normal clean it usually runs for about 20 min. I clean it once a week and I still have a great deal of uses left in the cleaning fluid before I have to buy another pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning fluid smells great and like many others have talked about on here is easy to conserve by removing it when you&#x27;re not cleaning the shaver and capping it; doing this prevents it from evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very satisfied with this product, my only complaint would be that if you allow a few days worth of stubble to grow out it will take a while longer to shave, and subsequently require more passes. It is well worth the price I got it for ($162) and I have now become an enthusiastic Braun customer. I can only hope that their future products will be even better.</li>
    <li> I have found the shaving far better than expected.  It is comfortable and fast. It is easy to clean out the shavings after use.  I have not tried the liquid cleaner as I have not yet felt it necessary.  The only weakness is the lack of a trimmer to end the sideburns.  I regret not saving my previous shaver that had a trimmer for use with that single function.</li>
    <li> My husband thoroughly likes this shaver.  Our first shaver we have bought (other than razors)</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the shaver.  It does everything expected.  This is my second Braun shaver and would not consider any other brand.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I had no idea that a powered shaver could do as good a job as a multiple blade razor. I am over a century old, and I just got tired of razors, paying big change for disposables that cost pennies or 20 bucks for cartridges that really cost 5 bucks. I read the reviews and hoped the Braum would do a good job. Boy-howdy, worth the money. GOOD BYE RAZORS, YOU AIN,T FLEECING ME FROM HERE ON OUT.</li>
    <li> Better than expected, even with all the great reviews.  Can&#x27;t see myself ever using a razor again.  It does take slightly longer than a razor, but not when you factor in dealing with shaving cream and cleaning the sink after razor shaving.  Plus you wont ever cut yourself on accident.  And good bye trips to buy more razors and cream!</li>
    <li> Always been a fan of Braun! This meets the standard and then some. Received this item as described and on time.</li>
    <li> This is the second braun I have own. They do an excellent job.</li>
    <li> This shaver works fine. It is a little noisy for use in the morning. Shaves almost as close as a razor.</li>
    <li> I love this thing, this model and the next step up is the best Electric Shaver that i would buy...  it performs and cuts my beard perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is saying much because no other shaver has ever been able to satisfy me and i have thick dense beard stubble and lights sometime.</li>
    <li> Good Razor but save your money and get a regular one!  IIts just like any other razor so save your money.</li>
    <li> The product seemed to work great.  My husband has a thick beard and for many years refused to use an electric razor.  However he loves this one.  It gives him a close shave and his face isn&#x27;t cut, like it was with the straight razor.  It is loud, but if your man doesn&#x27;t like to shave like my doesn&#x27;t, who cares! I purchased the prodcut in July and last week it stopped working last week.  He has yet to figure out why and I hoping for th $165 I paid for it, it is something he can fix.</li>
    <li> Pete Soots recommended this shaver to me back in the 80s. He is right. The best there is. It shaves real close and does not pull hairs.</li>
    <li> It takes a bit of getting used to after my series 5 i had for several years, but does do a decent job. The thing that i do not like is that the cleaning unit is extremely noisy. Vibrates the counter. I wish it would fit my old cleaning unit.</li>
    <li> I have always had a tough time with traditional razors and electric razors annoying my skin and causing ridiculous razor burn.  From the get go this foil shaver has given me a perfect shave on dry skin that is faster than any shaver or four blade stick razor with no need for messy shaving cream.  It was important that I found a good way to shave because I also deal with eczema and shaving can really annoy that problem as well.  I started a job where I have to shave every day and investing in this razor a few months ago has been the best decision I ever made.  I also think the cleaning cartridges are great and keep the razor in great condition, I use it after every shave and the first cartridge I used lasted past the 2 months and I finally tossed it for a fresh one because I just thought I should.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  This is my 3rd Braun shaver over the years.  This one is definitely my favorite in the way it cuts and moves with my face.  Good quality!</li>
    <li> I bought a Norelco 3D razor first and tried it for 3 weeks and just wasn&#x27;t impressed with the shave I received. I returned that and bought this in place, and I am so glad I did. To me, the shave is just much better with much less need to go over the same spot again and again. I also like shaving in a straight line motion rather than in circles like the rotary razors require. Overall, I highly recommend the 7 series!</li>
    <li> With my previous electric razors I always needed to shave with my manual razor at least twice a week because the electric would not shave close enough on my neck. This new Braun Series 7-760 is fabulous. I have used it everyday since it arrived and have had no need to shave manually. The other great thing is the cleaning system. I really disliked having to clean my other razors because when I didn&#x27;t they would begin to stink. Not now! I just place the razor in the cradle, push the button and walk away. As a side benefit it leaves the bathroom with a pleasant lemon scent. The battery is good. I took a week trip and used it everyday and still had plenty of battery left. I highly recommend this shaver system!</li>
    <li> This model seems to shave closer and with less effort.  Most significantly, the cutter and screen design is now a single unit vs. two separate units in my older model.  Over the many years using my older model the mechanism that hold the cutter stem failed twice.  The Series 760cc design precludes a recurrence of this problem.</li>
    <li> My face feels as smooth as with my razor just with less irritation.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend love it~</li>
    <li> Great everyday shaver that is better than the Arc 4 that I returned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro -&lt;br /&gt;- Close and accurate shave - the head is not too big (Arc 4 was huge)&lt;br /&gt;- The unit is quieter than the Panasonic Arc 4&lt;br /&gt;- Replacement foil + clean carts are easy to come by (retail and Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;- Nice looking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con -&lt;br /&gt;- Wish the clean &amp; shave system was a little more quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, not going to be a shave as close as a razor, but great for efficiency.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for over a decade.  I see all the pros and cons and I still recommend  Braun.  The shave is excellent for my beard and the battery charge lasts for over two weeks when I need it for a long trip.</li>
    <li> Not as good as a razor but for convenance can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver in 20 years as I never felt it was as close as a blade. Recently I cut myself shaving and had tissue paper all over my face. My wife suggested that an electric shaver might be a good idea..  LOL. It got me thinking and I did a little research. We figured that electric shavers had to have gotten better over two decades and I figured I&#x27;d try the Braun Series 7-760cc as the reviews were very good. Well after a month I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long! This shaver is SWEET! Closer than a blade and no cuts! The self cleaning feature is great (I use it daily) and the cleaning solution has lasted a whole month and still going strong. It leaves the shaver clean and it has a great scent! Can&#x27;t rave enough about it as it&#x27;s a great shave and I actually enjoy and look forward to shaving each morning. My wife like the results too!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase of this shaver. Works perfectly, I intend to recommend to my friends this product.</li>
    <li> The best electric razor I have ever own</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun pulsonic shaver in the last 10 years the both worked well my only complaint is the battery begins to fail after 7-8 years. they give a very close shave</li>
    <li> This item was a great buy for me especially  with all the traveling i do, i even shave in the car while on the way to work</li>
    <li> My husband and I were sad when his first Braun Pulsonic died. It was such a nice surprise that this new one works just as well... even better actually. Hopefully it will also last 10 years!</li>
    <li> Bought a 3 series a while back that lasted for 5-6 years was very happy with it so I bought this 7 series. This broke in less than a year. It makes a horrible sound, does not perform well anymore and the battery just drains out very very quickly within 2-3 shaves.</li>
    <li> I was looking for parts for an older model and couldn&#x27;t find what I wanted so broke down and bought my husband this new one, he likes to very much. highly recommend</li>
    <li> My husband has used this for a couple of years now, and still loves it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Easy to store. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Great features. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> They are heavy and not as soft as were in store -- maybe they need to be worked in a bit prior to evaluating.</li>
    <li> Would be a 5 with sideburn trimmer</li>
    <li> Excellent product and an improvement  over the older Braun in all respects other than the sideburn, mustache trimmer--the older model was better.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and simple and effective cleaning.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a christmas present. Saves my husband lots of time everyday. Gives a good close shave and the self-cleaning thing is awesome. The first cartridge just went yucky and it&#x27;s been quite a few months so I totally think it was worth it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves his shaver.  He is in his sixties and the rotary shaver didn&#x27;t seem to work as well with the change in his skin and hair.  HE loves this and says it&#x27;s as close to a razor shave as you can get.  I agree it&#x27;s one more thing that has to be plugged in and one more &amp;#34;vampire&amp;#34; light at night, but for the shave he gets, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> Not quite as close as a blade, but the next best thing!</li>
    <li> I read all the other reviews and I can confirm:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This is the best shave I have ever had from an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;2) Those stubborn neck whiskers (right where a collared shirt rides) are gone.&lt;br /&gt;3) The cleaning unit works as advertised (too early to judge the frequency of solution replacement).&lt;br /&gt;4) It is too early to determine how long the blades last (18 months is quoted).&lt;br /&gt;5) The feel of the razor and shaving motion is natural and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon registering the razor, Braun give an extra year of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a cheap S.O.B., so I had a hard time paying so much for a razor. However, I have learned that a year&#x27;s supply of four or five blade &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; razor blades can cost $150 - $175. As this unit is predicted to last ~7 years - even with solution and replacement head purchases - it is a financial win.</li>
    <li> I am one of those middle-aged guys who likes the convenience of an electric razor AND likes gadgets, so I sheepishly admit I&#x27;ve owned more of these things than is probably reasonable.  That being said, I strongly recommend the Braun.  It&#x27;s a great unit that I&#x27;ve used every morning for almost a year now and it always does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips though: wash your face every night with a good men&#x27;s facial cleanser like Nivea before you go to bed and shave every morning as soon as you get up.  The clean skin with a little natural oil on it with only a day&#x27;s growth is the best condition for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a heavy beard or don&#x27;t shave every day, use a rotary razor.  It&#x27;s not as good a system but the Pulsonic doesn&#x27;t handle long or dense beards well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This shaver has the best and longest lasting battery of any shaver I&#x27;ve owned. Three weeks and still 40% charge left, and that&#x27;s from using it every day!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband and it does a great job.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Everyone told me that he would be pleased with the Braun.  I highly recommend this Shaver System.</li>
    <li> good，its my second purchase on amazon.</li>
    <li> Outstanding shaver!  This Braun shaver gives a very good, close shave compared to other Norelco or Panasonic shavers that I have owned.  I have been shaving with electric razors for at least 15 years and during that time I have owned/used Panasonic (foil) and Norelco (rotary) razors, but this Braun Series 7 is by far the bast razor that I have owned.  I do not have a heavy beard, but with the other razors I found that I still had to go over the area several times because I could still feel the stubble.  With this razor, one time and my face feels like I shaved with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this razor to a friend.</li>
    <li> Not good for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I replaced my series 5 with Braun Series 7-760cc model which works much better.</li>
    <li> The shaver works fine and is less pesky about cleaning but the mustache/beard trimmer is almost useless. I had a lower end Braun 5 series and it was so much better. But this one is designed in a way where it&#x27;s very hard to see the trimmer over the top of the shaver to make sure you are trimming the right parts. I wish someone else would have said its a poor design when I bought this. If you only shave and trim sideburns you&#x27;ll be fine but anything in front of your face is a pain in the butt.</li>
    <li> What a great shaver.  For most of my shaving life I had been using Norelco shavers, but this one is much better and does a really nice job, plus it has a cleaning station which cleans and charges the unit.</li>
    <li> Great shaver at a great price! I love how it shaves and has auto clean. Too bad the cleaning solutions aren&#x27;t cheaper to buy</li>
    <li> Exellent as designed.Recommend to anyone who requires the need to shave. That is all i have to say about that.</li>
    <li> The razor itself is the best I have ever owned. I have always had trouble with red marks after shaving on my neck and irritation. Not so with this razor. I can shave even after a few days of growth and never any sign of irritation. On top of that, it is a very smooth shave, better than I can get with a regular razor (which also irritate my skin). The wife was very impressed.  5 of 5 *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base however has a flaw that is due to poor design. The contacts for charging the razor have a nasty habit of getting stuck just inside the plastic surface. Mine repeatedly fall in by simply inserting the razor. I believe this may be what is causing the other reviewers&#x27; issues with the cleaning cycle stopping and having to remove and reinsert the razor. Now, one of them has fallen in and I can&#x27;t get it to pop back out. Trying to coax it out led to it being bent and still stuck. The contact is at the end of a thin stem that apparently bends very easily. I will report back on how easy it is to get fixed under warranty. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll have to crack open the case. Sure I could charge it directly, but the bad prong also means it will not run the cleaning cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in such a cheap solution to a fairly easy problem (how hard is it to put two solid prongs on top of a small spring, or secure them both at the top and bottom???). A $200 razor packaged with a $30 razor&#x27;s base. 2 of 5 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the base I give it an overall 3 of 5 ****</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver. I wore out the first one. I still also use the top Gilette Safety Razor as well, but most say the SERIES 7-760cc gives me almost as close a shave.</li>
    <li> Two important points to keep in mind...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. You can&#x27;t return this product to Amazon, even if it is defective... it is considered a product with hazardous material in it. So you are at the mercy of Braun USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The &#x27;Lock\\&quot; mechanism, which switches the shaving head from a swivel to a fixed orientation, broke after 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> This shaver is nothing like the Braun 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Procter &amp; Gamble shaver with a German name. It is made of plastic (rather than metal), it has a flimsy hair trimmer which pops out at a very odd angle, and it comes with a small, ineffective cleaning brush. The carrying case can only hold the shaver and not the power cord (which makes travel cumbersome). There is no protection cap to cover the foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil and cutter are now one unit which, at first, seems like a good idea. But if there&#x27;s damage to either piece, the whole cassette must be replaced. On the old Braun shaver, the foil can be replaced without changing the cutter (or vice versa) if it was accidentally damaged. After 9+ years of using the 7526, this has happened. A new cassette also costs $12+ more than the same parts for the old shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband loves is shaver.  He&#x27;s been looking for months for the right shaver and he&#x27;s found it.  Thanks Braun and Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> This shaver is so much better than old 7000 series. Most notably the op out trimmer. I think it shaves close great!</li>
    <li> Does much better on my wrinkled face than my last rotery shaver.  It gives me a great shave everytime and the cleaner works good.</li>
    <li> Best shaves yet. I think it is safe to say you can&#x27;t go wrong with a Braun. The cleaning system may be overkill, but I subscribed to it. You might as well but a replacement foil and blade while you&#x27;re shopping - I replace mine every 18 months.</li>
    <li> Good, but after 1 year become dull, heads needs  replacement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an electric shaver for over 65 years, and this is the best ever, bar none.  The cleaning system is aces.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. Gets my husband&#x27;s face way way smooth. The only thing he doesn&#x27;t like about it is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t work very well on his neck. He usually uses a manual razor to touch up his neck. That&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t get the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have had a Panny in the past.  This is quieter and seems to do the job more efficiently.  I love it, so far!</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for the past 3 weeks now and I must say, it is really top notch. The charge holds for up to 5 days and I shave for about 6-7 minutes every morning.</li>
    <li> I tried this razor as soon as I got it and it does live up to what it promisses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike Bagley</li>
    <li> Recently had to purchase an electric shaver because of blood thinner medication. The Series 7-760 has solve my problem. I not only get a smooth shave and have no fear of cutting myself.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric razor. It is not as good as a razor and shaving cream but a lot easier and does an acceptable job.</li>
