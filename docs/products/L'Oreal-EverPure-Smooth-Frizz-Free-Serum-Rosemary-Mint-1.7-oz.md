      <li>it seems to go farther and work better.</li>
      <li>It makes your so shiny and healthy looking-but non-greasy like alot of shine serums tend to do.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this serum but the one I bought from SPLASHDEAL is NOT the serum.</li>
      <li>This serum works better for me than it&#x27;s ritzy cousin Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax Elixer</li>
      <li>Wished it smelled more like</li>
      <li>I also use the L&#x27;Oreal Eversleek Precious Oil Treatment with Argan Oil, and I find the two products to be comparable.</li>
      <li>I also use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverPure Sulfate-Free Color Care System shampoo and conditioner and am very happy with them also (besides which, this entire line is 100% vegan, not tested on animals, and is sulfate-free).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Sometimes I wash my hair at night, massage two pumps of serum thru my hair, pull hair into a ponytail and bun on top of my head and go to sleep.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and absolutely love frizz taming effect on my hair.</li>
      <li>Works like most smoothing serums except has a better smell..</li>
      <li>I will order more to have on hand in case these sell out when I am needing more.</li>
      <li>She keeps stealing it from me. . :)</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I was able to use this and let my hair air dry and my hair didnt look perfect but didnt look out of control either.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my hair texture has become more smooth and silky since using this product.</li>
      <li>This product is so light</li>
      <li>It does help smooth my hair</li>
      <li>It does not make my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of damage to my hair from medications and using the L&#x27;Oreal line of sulfate free shampoos and now this rosemary mint serum - makes a huge difference in my hair.  </li>
      <li>EverPure Smooth Shampoo, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]] ..</li>
      <li>EverPure Smooth Conditioner, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the fragrance in the smooth shampoo and conditioner either</li>
      <li>The smell is fresh and clean and I am ok using this product</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t significantly extend my drying time, either.  </li>
      <li>Try it with the full line of Loreal products for humidity</li>
      <li>Even putting this on freshly washed hair, my scalp starts to take on a greasy appearance.</li>
      <li>the first time i used loreal ever pure  smooth serum, i did not feel any difference.</li>
      <li>I have used it right after washing my hair and after blow drying.</li>
      <li>But for someone with very curly and dry hair, this is probably a good choice.</li>
      <li>Even though Frizz-Ease is much thicker, my hair still feels full of body and not oily at all.</li>
      <li>It makes flat-ironed hair super straight and shiny too.</li>
      <li>Granted my hair isn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;frizzy&#x27;.</li>
      <li>In fact I really love this entire line by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
      <li>Its really lightweight, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily in your hair at all!</li>
      <li>In any event, I love this product, use it all the time, and definitely recommend it!  </li>
      <li>I used 3 pumps on my first time using it, and my hair looked like a greasy mop that&#x27;s been stuck in a grease trap all day.</li>
      <li>It says to use 2 pumps of this on wet/dry hair, but I find that using 1 pump for my ends, and maybe 1 pump for the top of my hair is enough.</li>
      <li>and it gets frizzy at the first sign of humidity.</li>
      <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products that haven&#x27;t worked, but this does.  </li>
      <li>These two products leave my long, fine, curly hair smooth, soft, and sleek.</li>
      <li>Works even better if I blow dry then style my hair.  </li>
      <li>and then either blow dry or air dry my hair, and when it dries it is super smooth and frizz-free!!</li>
      <li>I have used all types of super expensive products recommended from stylists over the years, and have tried all brands of expensive serums from the store at $20+ dollars a teensy bottle, and THIS is by far the best product I have found (and especially at this great price!)  </li>
      <li>I also have flat, easily oily hair and this added insult to injury for the oils in my hair.</li>
      <li>I really just prefer no fragrance..</li>
      <li>Thanks..    </li>
      <li>and really helps  with my unruly hair</li>
      <li>product-- really like that.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product !</li>
      <li>This is like lots of other serums, its ok.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for someone who needs frizz control.</li>
      <li>I would highly recomend this product.</li>
      <li>Turned a freshly showered head into a visual of a 3 day grease fest, and my fly-aways still flew.</li>
      <li>I have had some many compliments, and people asking what I&#x27;ve done differently with my hair, after just using this product and blowing dry my hair.  </li>
      <li>It definitely improved the look of my hair when used right after blow drying, however I did not see any definitive improvement.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used it on dry hair, but I always use it right before I dry my hair with a hair dryer, and it&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
      <li>Since I live in New England, the frizz happens often.</li>
      <li>My naturally curly hair tends to get frizzy, this really takes the frizz out and makes it feel and look soft.</li>
      <li>My 12 yr old daughter loves it too!</li>
      <li>Keeps hair feeling extremely soft..</li>
      <li>This product REALLY smooths out the hair, definitely makes it shinier, and gets rid of \\&quot;fly-a-way\\&quot;, static-y issues.  </li>
      <li>But after 4 days my hair become soft and I could feel the difference.</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s not too greasy, and it disappears completely into my hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells spectacular. Too expensive though</li>
    <li> The Rosemary Mint scent MAY sound like an odd combination, but only has a very slight scent that I actually like (and I&#x27;m not someone who loves anything with a heavy, artificial scent -- this does NOT have that!)  The bottle really lasts a long time -- I just use a couple of pumps, coat my palms to spread it out, and then massage it into my still wet hair.  I also comb it through after that with a wide tooth comb.  This product REALLY smooths out the hair, definitely makes it shinier, and gets rid of \\&quot;fly-a-way\\&quot;, static-y issues.  I have used all types of super expensive products recommended from stylists over the years, and have tried all brands of expensive serums from the store at $20+ dollars a teensy bottle, and THIS is by far the best product I have found (and especially at this great price!)  I also use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverPure Sulfate-Free Color Care System shampoo and conditioner and am very happy with them also (besides which, this entire line is 100% vegan, not tested on animals, and is sulfate-free).  In any event, I love this product, use it all the time, and definitely recommend it!  BUY THIS PRODUCT - it is definitely AMAZING and it WORKS!!</li>
    <li> Works like most smoothing serums except has a better smell.. Keeps hair feeling extremely soft.. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> great  stuff and really helps  with my unruly hair</li>
    <li> this serum works great!! i put it on after i get out the shower applying about two pumps and then either blow dry or air dry my hair, and when it dries it is super smooth and frizz-free!! and it smells awesome!! I always had a problem with frizz and this serum is perfect. Its really lightweight, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily in your hair at all!</li>
    <li> I like this, its not to heavy like some oils can be using in my hair. Its a nice change from that and with not having to use a lot I see this small bottle lasting a while. I will order more to have on hand in case these sell out when I am needing more. It is now a must have for me!!</li>
    <li> Helps the fight frizz.  Wished it smelled more like the shampoo and conditioner do,  can barely smell the rosemary and mint scent.  I added peppermint oil to mine and it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works great! It tamed frizzies and fly aways. You can find it at Walmart or any drugstore. Try it with the full line of Loreal products for humidity</li>
    <li> It smells very good.  And left my hair shiny and soft, but it does not reduce my frizz completely, maybe I need to use it longer. The smell is fresh and clean and I am ok using this product but maybe I going to looking for another just for try.</li>
    <li> This serum works great.  I have long, wavy, frizzy, and color treated hair.  I was able to use this and let my hair air dry and my hair didnt look perfect but didnt look out of control either.  Works even better if I blow dry then style my hair.  I would highly recomend this product. PS...there is also no greasy feeling when using this product.</li>
    <li> This serum works better for me than it&#x27;s ritzy cousin Kerastase Nutritive Oleo-Relax Elixer and I keep more dollars in my pocket too! Two pumps in the palm of my hand and massaged through damp hair before blow drying keeps hair frizz-free even the next day. It makes flat-ironed hair super straight and shiny too. ALSO when your ends are split and you aren&#x27;t ready to cut them, apply a pump or two rubbed just on them and blow dry on high during your hair routine. It&#x27;s an instant split end repair trick I bet you&#x27;ll like but you eventually still have to cut them off :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I wash my hair at night, massage two pumps of serum thru my hair, pull hair into a ponytail and bun on top of my head and go to sleep. In the morning I have frizz-free flowing hair. This product manages my hair, makes it tame and GLISTEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Useful hints from the ritzy cousin&#x27;s website which is for professionals. I haven&#x27;t done ALL THREE AT THE SAME TIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use as pre-treatment: apply to hair before shampoo...I do about 15 minutes before shampoo and conditioner, THEN just blowdry hair and continue remainder of hair routine&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;2. Use after shampoo and conditioner , while hair is damp, as a style aid ...our usual directions&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;3. Use after blowdry to add some glisteny shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find if I take the time to rub the serum between my palms a bit to \\&quot;warm\\&quot; it up before applying it to my hair it seems to go farther and work better. Too bad this is difficult to find in stores, it&#x27;s wonderful AND the ritzy cousin is between twenty-five and thirty two bucks - EEK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI...Garnier Sleek and Shine Anti-Frizz Serum is yet another cousin from the same L&#x27;Oreal Corporate Family which also includes Redken, Matrix, Mizani and Shu Uemura. I guess I&#x27;ll try Garnier Sleek and Shine when my EverPure Serum stash runs out.</li>
    <li> Love this product. In fact I really love this entire line by L&#x27;Oreal. This really does a great job and it leaves my hair silky and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I have thick, blonde, wavy hair and it gets frizzy at the first sign of humidity. Since I live in New England, the frizz happens often. I&#x27;ve tried serum after serum, cheap to expensive, and not many working that well. Well, this product is totally different! It tames my wavy hair, so that I can let it air dry. I love it!!! Give it a try, you can&#x27;t beat the price! Oh and it smells amazing too...</li>
    <li> My naturally curly hair tends to get frizzy, this really takes the frizz out and makes it feel and look soft. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have used it right after washing my hair and after blow drying. It makes your so shiny and healthy looking-but non-greasy like alot of shine serums tend to do. The smell is really nice and you don&#x27;t need alot of the product, it goes along way! I highly recommend this product !</li>
    <li> I have to admit i only used this once.. I cant bring myself to use it again.. it is stinky i think and i didn&#x27;t see that it worked either.. It could have just been my attitude over the smell.. I really just prefer no fragrance..I don&#x27;t like the fragrance in the smooth shampoo and conditioner either but they work amazing!..[[ASIN:B001P1ZEMC L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Smooth Conditioner, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]] [[ASIN:B001P24STQ L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Smooth Shampoo, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]] .. This just doesnt do it for me</li>
    <li> For the price, this is an amazing, effective product.  I like that it&#x27;s not too greasy, and it disappears completely into my hair, I don&#x27;t feel like it is weighed down after I use it.  It doesn&#x27;t significantly extend my drying time, either.  I have had some many compliments, and people asking what I&#x27;ve done differently with my hair, after just using this product and blowing dry my hair.  Smells nice, too.</li>
    <li> Item just as described. I use it every other day. It&#x27;s very dry where I live and it definitely tames my unruly hair. WIll buy again!</li>
    <li> This product has a weird, musty cigarette smell. Why is it called rosemary mint? It does not make my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> my hair is very dry and rough. after washing my hair it will seem like a brush. the first time i used loreal ever pure  smooth serum, i did not feel any difference. But after 4 days my hair become soft and I could feel the difference. Another good product from loreal! Thanks..    the package also arrived on the estimated delivery date with no damage. Thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this serum but the one I bought from SPLASHDEAL is NOT the serum. The serum I have presently is of a thick syrupy consistency. The one that was delivered had a thin runny consistency as if the bottle had been filled up by water. It had no smell whatsoever. A total waste of money. I won&#x27;t ever buy from this dealer.</li>
    <li> This product is so light and you hardly feel the oiliness when you apply it in hair. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair texture has become more smooth and silky since using this product. Highly recommend it for someone who needs frizz control.</li>
    <li> This has a nice feel to it--doesn&#x27;t leave the hair feeling chalky or stiff like some other \\&quot;smoothers\\&quot; do. I also use the L&#x27;Oreal Eversleek Precious Oil Treatment with Argan Oil, and I find the two products to be comparable. These two products leave my long, fine, curly hair smooth, soft, and sleek. I&#x27;ve been on an expensive search for such products and I think I have two winners, thanks to the reviews here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I purchased L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Frizz Taming Crème Serum, which I threw away after the first use, as that product DID leave my hair unmanageable, unbrushable, and just plain icky.</li>
    <li> I have medium length hair that is a little on the thin side. Not to mention it&#x27;s really dry. It says to use 2 pumps of this on wet/dry hair, but I find that using 1 pump for my ends, and maybe 1 pump for the top of my hair is enough. I used 3 pumps on my first time using it, and my hair looked like a greasy mop that&#x27;s been stuck in a grease trap all day. I&#x27;ve never used it on dry hair, but I always use it right before I dry my hair with a hair dryer, and it&#x27;s fine for me. I&#x27;ll never go without this stuff.</li>
    <li> It smells sooo good and makes my hair so smooth.  My 12 yr old daughter loves it too! She keeps stealing it from me. . :)</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and many times these serums weigh it down too  much and looks greasy.  This one is Awesome.  I followed the directions and absolutely love frizz taming effect on my hair. Leaves it shiny -- and the scent is amazing.. Smells nice and not too overpowering. I&#x27;ve had a lot of damage to my hair from medications and using the L&#x27;Oreal line of sulfate free shampoos and now this rosemary mint serum - makes a huge difference in my hair.  Highly Recommend.  Lightweight product-- really like that.</li>
    <li> It does help smooth my hair and I like the scent, but it makes my hair look a little oily.  I prefer John Freida Frizz-Eaze extra-strength serum.  Even though Frizz-Ease is much thicker, my hair still feels full of body and not oily at all.</li>
    <li> I like this product and here&#x27;s how I use it:  I take just the tiniest amount in my palm (less than a dime) and then massage it into  hair ends and dry/style as usual.  I find  that it makes the ends curl up again nicely versus frizz. Some warning: it IS a somewhat oily substance, so if you rub it all over your hair (which I don&#x27;t recommend), you may end up with a &#x27;wet look&#x27; which won&#x27;t go away until the next washing.  Some others have complained of the odd fragrance, but I think the fragrance is just fine.  I do recommend and was unsure of giving 4 or 5 stars...  (Oh- just so you know and can compare with your own: my hair is thin, overprocessed by coloring, and tends to frizz- this seems to be a very good product for the ends!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years now. It&#x27;s perfect for adding a nice shine to my gray hair which has lost its natural luster over the years. And a little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s economical too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to go along with other L&#x27;Oreal products and I like it. It works well with my hair type and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Granted my hair isn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;frizzy&#x27;. I just have a lot of fly-away&#x27;s from all the blow drying. I also have flat, easily oily hair and this added insult to injury for the oils in my hair. Turned a freshly showered head into a visual of a 3 day grease fest, and my fly-aways still flew.</li>
    <li> The best stuff ever.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different products that haven&#x27;t worked, but this does.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot left my hair soft and shiny its smelled really nice didn&#x27;t leave hair to oily  probably buy again</li>
    <li> This product works pretty well, but there are quite a few downsides. Even putting this on freshly washed hair, my scalp starts to take on a greasy appearance. I also noticed the &#x27;smoky&#x27; smell a few other reviews mentioned. It smells fine on the hair, but if you don&#x27;t wash your hands immediately after it leaves a nasty smell.</li>
    <li> This is like lots of other serums, its ok. Mae my hair look a bit greasy faster than it normally would, and I did use a small amount. But for someone with very curly and dry hair, this is probably a good choice.</li>
    <li> very nice for hairs and gives a saloon like feeling, a must buy for frizzy hairs. very light nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews found here and frankly I was a bit disappointed. I used it together with the masque from the same line and overall I was not impressed by the results. It definitely improved the look of my hair when used right after blow drying, however I did not see any definitive improvement. It is not better than any other serums found at supermarkets.</li>
