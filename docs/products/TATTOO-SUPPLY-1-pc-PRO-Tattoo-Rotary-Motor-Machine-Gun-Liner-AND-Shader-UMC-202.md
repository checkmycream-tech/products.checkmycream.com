      <li>very nice looking, some parts looks very cheap.</li>

      <li>So this just came in the mail and it feels very cheap</li>
      <li>I WILL BUY MORE ROTARY MACHINES FROM THEM</li>
      <li>but I use these most for shading and color packing.</li>
      <li>most parts are plastic and could have better performance with more precision</li>
      <li>love coils &amp; Rotary&#x27;s,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will probably purchase more.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>hey what do u expect at this price, now I&#x27;m going,to spend more money on a better made one....</li>
      <li>Care, Bill Kearney :-)</li>
      <li>it runs smooth lines and packs in color nice.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>This was an emergency purchase when stealth broke but will purchase again :)</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I am very happy i ordered this gun although its a Chinese knock off of the dragonfly which is a 500+ dollar machine</li>
      <li>Love it ordering more...</li>
      <li>At the end of the day it is a good machine and you will get your moneys worth</li>
      <li>they run the more heat and magnetic flux builds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i hope i can give a better review win it gets here if you want your item fast go</li>
      <li>The best machinw I used in decades I recomend it to whoever wants to do some real tattoo work this is a very light machine to work with very light</li>
      <li>Very light and easy to use.</li>
      <li>but I have it set pretty good,</li>
      <li>IT MADE PRETTY GOOD LINES.</li>
      <li>Surprised with the product runs good happy with the purchase  fast shipping</li>
      <li>most comfortable tattoo ever</li>
      <li>if you, like me are using it as a test run to see if the real one is a good purchase (straying from coils)</li>
      <li>Super quiet and runs perfectly for lining/shading/color packing.</li>
      <li>one of the best machines i have bought yet keeps a very straight line and well rounded motor for this price i definitely will buy more in fact</li>
      <li>For a inexpensive gun not bad!</li>
      <li>something I can easily fix...</li>
      <li>Spring tensioner is functional and makes lining and shading as easy as twisting the nob.  </li>
      <li>Still going strong.</li>
      <li>At first i thought that it looked kind of cheap</li>
      <li>For a cheap machine, especially for someone just getting into tattooing, this is a great choice.</li>
      <li>, my personal opinion if ur looking for a vibrator, your in luck, LOL....</li>
      <li>Great For Smaller Needle Groupings.</li>
      <li>and I both enjoy the light weight.</li>
      <li>the body of the machine is made of really cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t turn to tighten because the L-allan wrench doesn&#x27;t fit,</li>
      <li>- the light weight design takes some getting used to.</li>
      <li>looks awsome but its just a cheap plastic gun and doesent have any where close to the power it needs to do the job.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get my tube in(need to cut it to fit), the L-allan wrench doesn&#x27;t fit the screws, I used the machine and the nipple arm/rod came off and the tension screw</li>
      <li>Lightweight and cheap plastic parts.</li>
      <li>But not bad for the price and works fine with lining and shading.</li>
      <li>the whole thing is plastic it makes for a cool decoration but its not sturdy enuf to do a solid tattoo but for the price it&#x27;s cool to have in my shop but your best bet is to get a pro rotary machine</li>
      <li>this is one reason you see a lot of new tattoo artist 2 years in the business knocking out Awesome Tattoos.. that 10 years ago wouldn&#x27;t be possible in that amount of time tattooing..</li>
      <li>These rotary machines are definitely worth the buy for the money!</li>
      <li>so this is pretty cute</li>
      <li>I fell in love using it for the first time, but as soon as i finished the line work and switched to shading, the guillotine screw started spinning and wouldnt clamp/</li>
      <li>love this gun very light easy set up works like a charm thinking of getting a few more for gp</li>
      <li>actually although I had my doubts it would work good</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, as much as i love it, you really do get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>more educational information regarding tattooing see my Amazon.com Reviews, I have packed each review with tons of educational information, tips links to Free Tattooing e books PDF&#x27;S, Videos..</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>This is not a bad machine at all for it&#x27;s price.  </li>
      <li>this is very inexpensive, and works better than a true jailhouse machine.</li>
      <li>Not A Bad Machine.</li>
      <li>its quite as hell which is great for people who kinda have that &#x27;reaction&#x27; to the sound of typical coil machines turning on.</li>
      <li>SO MUCH LIGHTER THAN ALL OTHER MACHINES WORKS GREAT, FAVORITE ONE</li>
      <li>it works like its worth more its light and pretty consistent</li>
      <li>The plastic frames make them exceptionally lightweight and they have very low vibration and noise.</li>
      <li>Delivery was quick but it came with no paper work on it</li>
      <li>I bought this as a joke to see what it was about and found out quickly.</li>
      <li>Ok so first of this whole machine is plastic.</li>
      <li>thank you for fast shipping!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Do not buy its the worst ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it ordering more...</li>
    <li> Decent machine for what it cost</li>
    <li> i hate this gun, i desided too start runing tattoos agin. and thought this might be something worth wild.... boy was i wrong</li>
    <li> got it and it doesn&#x27;t work.... works for 3 seconds then quits , has no power .. waste of my money</li>
    <li> This rotary machine made me want to switch from coil to rotary. Absolutely love it. Unfortunately, as much as i love it, you really do get what you pay for. I fell in love using it for the first time, but as soon as i finished the line work and switched to shading, the guillotine screw started spinning and wouldnt clamp/hold the tube in place (diddnt even last 1 full session). Contacted the seller, and he shipped me a 2nd one out very quickly. Unfortunately, it did it again, only this time, it happened mid tattoo. Not only did it cause my customer pain when the tube shot out and bent the needle, but it messed up the line and was hard to fix/hide.</li>
    <li> Ok so first of this whole machine is plastic. Yes and immediately thought to return it however i said well ill at least try it. Wow thoroughly impressed..... its light, SUPER light like writing with a heavy pen...its quite as hell which is great for people who kinda have that &#x27;reaction&#x27; to the sound of typical coil machines turning on. I havent tuned it or anything just ran it straight out of the shippin box with my crappiest spare parts just incase it ruined any of my nicer stuff. I got it for 8$ i see the price has doubled since i bought it a month ago but still worth a try, I&#x27;d say. Now I&#x27;m saving for a stigma prodigy...and although this is a decent machine with a similar look its not nice enough to be even considered a knockoff stigma. But i will say for people who have a hard time keeping ur line work straight these extremely light machines will help that tenfold.</li>
    <li> It works well, doesn&#x27;t make too much noise, doesnt vibrate as much and is auper light weight. I would have given it five stars but it doesn&#x27;t come in a box or with instruction so for someone who is starting out wouldn&#x27;t really know what to do.</li>
    <li> Decant gun, very light and is good for hard to do spots like necks.pretty quiet as well. Only problem is the rear adjustment seems not to work. Consequently it doesn&#x27;t need adjustment in my opinion.</li>
    <li> this product is very very light thats is good for tattooing and is work exelent and silents, i will buy some more thank you</li>
    <li> Going rotary from now on</li>
    <li> Great gun I definitely recommend this item</li>
    <li> I  purchase the supplies and tools  my  hubby tats  me  this machine is outstanding!  he is learning so sometimes has a heavy hand not with this machine  most comfortable tattoo ever</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality of this machine. Super quiet and runs perfectly for lining/shading/color packing. My new go yo machine I would definitely buy another</li>
    <li> This is a Awesome Running Rotary.. This Rotary will run correctly right out of the box. This is a Great Price.. Shipping was about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rotary&#x27;s work like a dentist drill. The difference between a Coil Tattoo Machine &amp; a Rotary is a ton!&lt;br /&gt;First Coils will fluctuate as they run the longer they run the more heat and magnetic flux builds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Rotary&#x27;s the machines runs the same all day every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally no need for the beginner to learn about metallurgy,coil science, the relationship between the rear deck &amp; the end of the armature bar. The angle of the rear deck, the weight of the armature bar, spring tensions. Coil height etc... This is a big reason in Tattoo Studios you see more Rotary&#x27;s each year... Most young professional tattoo artist now use Rotary&#x27;s..&lt;br /&gt;It just makes learning easier.. this is one reason you see a lot of new tattoo artist 2 years in the business knocking out Awesome Tattoos.. that 10 years ago wouldn&#x27;t be possible in that amount of time tattooing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love coils &amp; Rotary&#x27;s,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this helped you out please check the box √ Yes this review was Helpful!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more educational information regarding tattooing see my Amazon.com Reviews, I have packed each review with tons of educational information, tips links to Free Tattooing e books PDF&#x27;S, Videos..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This machine is good for use as a liner and shader, as a color packer  depending on needle grouping.  For larger needlegroupings say 25 mag no! You need a larger motor to push the grouping. But this is a Awesome Machine..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take Care, Bill Kearney :-)</li>
    <li> ive placed my order for this item 5 days ago nd its still say its in salllers facility i hope i can give a better review win it gets here if you want your item fast go sum were else to get it</li>
    <li> Does great work. Very light and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product was ordered on the tenth of January and the item was marked as shipped - or should I say that it left the seller&#x27;s facility and was en route to the carrier, USPS, on the eleventh. The item was suppose to be delivered sometime between the thirteenth and twenty-second of January. However, the item did not make it to the carrier, the United States Post Office in Flushing, NY, until the final day it was suppose to be delivered. This product is totally unacceptable. It does not work at all. I cannot plug it in. I cannot tattoo with this machine. It is possible that I will edit my review of this product if it ever arrives; but as of now, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery and equipment is great, thank you</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible, not at first, but after the first two days the damn gear flew off in the middle of a tattoo, i liked the light weight handling of it but seriously make these things a little more durable ! I give this a garbage rating dont buy this.</li>
    <li> For a inexpensive gun not bad! It lays well and my husband and I both enjoy the light weight. Not light and quit like a stealth but steal well! This was an emergency purchase when stealth broke but will purchase again :)</li>
    <li> i bought this item thinking i was buying a very cheaply made machine and turns out i was wrong about this item it turns out to b one of the best machines i have bought yet keeps a very straight line and well rounded motor for this price i definitely will buy more in fact i have already bought a few more of them already and the price is outstanding thank you amazon</li>
    <li> love this gun very light easy set up works like a charm thinking of getting a few more for gp</li>
    <li> great so far.. i hope it outlasts a couple of my other rotary machines.. hopefully buy more in the future</li>
    <li> Thank you awesome product</li>
    <li> If you have smaller hands and haven&#x27;t gotten comfortable to a machine with a huge motor this is the gun for you. Looks great, feels great, and gave me straight even and bold lines. 5 stars</li>
    <li> SO MUCH LIGHTER THAN ALL OTHER MACHINES WORKS GREAT, FAVORITE ONE NOW. I WILL BUY MORE ROTARY MACHINES FROM THEM</li>
    <li> there is no instructions or any sort of paperwork with this item at all</li>
    <li> this machine is very good for everything, colours, realism, outlining... is very light and powerfull, doesn&#x27;t need too much energy to work so.. is very good...</li>
    <li> No stars, complete junk. Broke the minute I used it. Waste of good money. Ill never buy here again.  Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> This machine sucks it gets hot fast &amp; don&#x27;t run rite.</li>
    <li> Quit after 15 minutes and too much aggravation to return!</li>
    <li> It got here a day early. That was great and it came intact, no damage, everything,is as described in picture....it does work..&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER-&lt;br /&gt;  The vibration is no better that a regular gun, it&#x27;s a little bit more silent, but,it&#x27;s only because the whole thing is made of plastic, it&#x27;s not fantastic,  if it we&#x27;re metal it would be impossible to operate, but hey what do u expect at this price, now I&#x27;m going,to spend more money on a better made one.... I would recommend this gun, but I can&#x27;t because there&#x27;s no good running for doing a good line. Can&#x27;t go below 6.5 and above 7.0 with out it being too deep and not enough, my personal opinion if ur looking for a vibrator, your in luck, LOL....</li>
    <li> have used several times holds up to lining and shading very well built also</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it one day and it over heated and glue started oozing out of it and now it dosent even work I haven&#x27;t even had it 4 hours and it&#x27;s already broken</li>
    <li> Just got this and a few other rotary guns in the mail today this one being the best of the three. It runs smoothly and very quiet my roommate has a rotary also but this one is even quieter. It feels weightless in your hand more so than other rotary&#x27;s. I ended up testing it out on myself after work it runs smooth lines and packs in color nice. Its easy to adjust the stroke of the needle by simply turning the Knob on the top of the machine. Not sure what its called but the little plastic wheel that&#x27;s meant to hold the needle in place instead of having to use a rubber band works really well actually although I had my doubts it would work good it worked great. Another thing i liked about this machine is every time i lifted my foot from the peddle the needle was pulled up some cheaper rotary&#x27;s will stop anywhere which isn&#x27;t horrible but is not preferred. I am very happy i ordered this gun although its a Chinese knock off of the dragonfly which is a 500+ dollar machine this is a great machine for the price also shipped fast with the standard i may just have to order a few more.</li>
    <li> i love this little thing. im used to coil machines with a little extra weight and shake but this thing is surpassing my dreams. as far as cheap machines go this is the one to buy. ive done atleast 10 quality tattoos with this and ive only had to tinker with it just a bit. id recomend this for someone who knows how to tattoo but is interested in seeing what rotary is all about.</li>
    <li> The Machine Worked Fine Until About The Third Time I Used It And It Started Falling Apart Piece By Piece.</li>
    <li> It came  on time it just sucks but for the price its ok I would not buy another one if I ever did use it I would only use it for lining not shading and only for real little tattoo&#x27;s like a name that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for .</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this little machine. It arrived fast. Everything works. Easy to take apart and put back together., Good material. I have over 24 hrs plus on this machine right now. Still going strong. Has replaced my conventional liner. LOVE IT. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Even came with a little baggie of small allen wrenches, and gear oil. Keep the yoke/armiture arm well greased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE this little guy. Will probably purchase more.</li>
    <li> most parts are plastic and could have better performance with more precision but thats what you get for 15$ it works like its worth more its light and pretty consistent so cant complain nice travel machine you dont have to worry about having to leave behind or something</li>
    <li> These rotary machines are definitely worth the buy for the money! Pretty solid for outline, but I use these most for shading and color packing. Good buy!</li>
    <li> received the machines today. fast delivery. disappointed when i opened the package. the body of the machine is made of really cheap plastic. the stroke knob doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s because is just a fake knob. but i guess that was what i paid for, right???&lt;br /&gt;the stroke is set and cant be adjusted. will see how it does. i was looking for a stroke adjuster type machine.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to look somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;be aware...</li>
    <li> I received the machine &amp; it was broken &amp; I dont know how 2 return it because I wouldve never got 2 use it</li>
    <li> It broke the first time using it</li>
    <li> It burn out. On my first tattoo</li>
    <li> Surprised with the product runs good happy with the purchase  fast shipping</li>
    <li> The best machinw I used in decades I recomend it to whoever wants to do some real tattoo work this is a very light machine to work with very light</li>
    <li> Piece of crap.  Do not waste the time nor the money.  I bought this as a joke to see what it was about and found out quickly.</li>
    <li> this is very inexpensive, and works better than a true jailhouse machine. don&#x27;t know how long it will last  still testing its quality. really doesn&#x27;t take much to tattoo so this is pretty cute</li>
    <li> Works good,super quiet.my only complaint is that it feels cheap,like just looking at it the wrong way will break it,but my complaint can be retracted do to the fact that it hasn&#x27;t broke and its still running strong.</li>
    <li> This machine is fine for shading but its too light and weak for solid lines IMO. It would be a fine back up machine but not a primary day to day machine for a full time artist</li>
    <li> THE MACHINE FELL APART WITHIN 20 MINUTES OF USE, THE MACHINE ALSO HAD A SPRING THAT KEPT THE BARREL FROM SLIDING INTO THE FRAME . BUT ALL IN ALL AFTER WORKING ON THE MACHINE IT MADE PRETTY GOOD LINES. WONT ORDER THIS BRAND AGAIN BUT I WILL MOST LIKLY ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!</li>
    <li> Not A Bad Machine. Motor Runs Great &amp; It Doesn&#x27;t Overheat. Definitely Worth The Money. Great For Smaller Needle Groupings. Don&#x27;t Go Beyond 7 Round Liners Or Shader Needles &amp; This Machine WILL Do Its Job Efficiently. I Can&#x27;t &amp; Won&#x27;t Speak For Other &amp;#34;China-Made&amp;#34; Machines, BUT, I Know This Particular Machine Surprised Me. I Would Recommend It To Other Artists To Try It Out.</li>
    <li> For the price it was an excellent gun!!! Really like using it. Have done alot of ink work and it still working like its fresh out the box.</li>
    <li> For a cheap machine, especially for someone just getting into tattooing, this is a great choice. I bought 4 (2 Black/2 Red) and have done all my tattooing with them. The plastic frames make them exceptionally lightweight and they have very low vibration and noise. And at the cost, if any of them ever go belly-up, they can be replaced for the cost of a small bottle of ink. Absolute must for anyone that&#x27;s trying to get started on a budget</li>
    <li> Great little machines and got it fast</li>
    <li> No problems here, actually works like a dream when running mid to low volts.  Spring tensioner is functional and makes lining and shading as easy as twisting the nob.  Highly recommended.  can&#x27;t beat the price for a good machine like this.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and cheap plastic parts. But not bad for the price and works fine with lining and shading.</li>
    <li> This is the second machine I have purchased in this style. They are hit and miss as far as the stroke setting goes. I have one that wont work at all and the new one works pretty well. At the end of the day it is a good machine and you will get your moneys worth</li>
    <li> I ordered the rotary because I&#x27;ve heard a lot of buzz about them, i ordered the fairly cheap one just to see what it was all about, i first opened the box to find a very small extremely light machine, i set it up and gave it a whirl, it is extremely quiet, lays very tight crisp lines and does not heat up or lose power. I was very surprised at how well the machine operated for the price. After using this machine for almost four months primarily for tight small spots and tight detail the machine is holding up very well, all the knobs and needle hold wheel are still tight, the screw at the back of the machine to set/adjust depth doesn&#x27;t work that well but I have it set pretty good, overall very pleased with this machine, for $15 you really cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> I got this little guy and it works well out of the package, It is definitely a knock off and it shows signs of it all over but at the end of the day this machine works better than most other knock offs I&#x27;ve used. With that being said it will never compare to the real thing or even a nicer coil machine.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick but it came with no paper work on it</li>
    <li> its okay if you hit past a certain speed some parts will actually fall apart so its okay but  its very light weight and very quiet</li>
    <li> Great rotarys bought 2 myself an they just came in an once you get them set up there beast</li>
    <li> At first i thought that it looked kind of cheap but when I finally used it, it worked out fine</li>
    <li> This machine is very lightweight and plastic. It feels like it may break at any second. Also it makes getting a good straight line difficult because it has alot of vibration and makes your line work seem shakey. Beware buyers.</li>
    <li> I thought the body would have been metal not plastic and it seems to hesitate while working but still for the money a good buy</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a good gun but it keep stopping when I&#x27;m not tattooing so this gun is no good</li>
    <li> So this just came in the mail and it feels very cheap the whole thing is plastic it makes for a cool decoration but its not sturdy enuf to do a solid tattoo but for the price it&#x27;s cool to have in my shop but your best bet is to get a pro rotary machine</li>
    <li> at the very first use i want to use como power and some parts fly be the air, very nice looking, some parts looks very cheap.</li>
    <li> no power what so ever . looks awsome but its just a cheap plastic gun and doesent have any where close to the power it needs to do the job. if you get it it would look cool in a collection but who ever you use this on will hate you for the rest of there life.</li>
    <li> Worked for an hour then literally fell apart! Needle tensioner broke, and cam linkage fell apart.</li>
    <li> I paid extra to receive my product within 3-5 days. My product was not shipped &#x27;til after 2 days. It sat in a facility for a whole day and I finally received it after 8 days. Bad place to order.</li>
    <li> anyone knows that tattoos that these are knockoffs but i mean it is a nice one though sometimes they might come broke but i mean hey its going threw the mail but i used this after i get it and did 3 tattoos back to back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it can LINE and SHADE which is a very nice combo very easy to just switch needles, this is a good buy esp. when you get it on a sale like i did.</li>
    <li> WOrks awesome.... used as a shader and it is great esp for a 12 dollar gun..everything and everybit what was advertised.. anywways packaging was excellent and was delivered very fast....</li>
    <li> the seller is awesome they shipped way ahead of schedule!! i&#x27;m so happy!&lt;br /&gt;- the product is half junk! the tension spring that used to hold needle arm -spring is too long I can&#x27;t get my tube in(need to cut it to fit), the L-allan wrench doesn&#x27;t fit the screws, I used the machine and the nipple arm/rod came off and the tension screw I can&#x27;t turn to tighten because the L-allan wrench doesn&#x27;t fit, spring cover  that controls the throw is plastic and spins off during use so it wont hold its tension. (I had to replace with metal screw with a screw head).-- if your not a advanced tattooist with some machine knowledge..your &amp;#34;f***ed&amp;#34;! I bought two of this pieces of junk!  I&#x27;ll definitely order from them again but actual tattoo machines ...something I can easily fix...thank you for fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> machine is fragile and cheap, you become scared to tighten the screw for fear of breaking it - you DO indeed, get what you pay for with this machine.  although it arrived in record time, the seller has nothing to do with the fact this machine is simply no good.  if you, like me are using it as a test run to see if the real one is a good purchase (straying from coils) then yes, give this shot - the light weight design takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad machine at all for it&#x27;s price.  For someone just starting out, or trying to get used to a rotary machine, I have no gripes about it at all.  nice and quiet, and runs well.  Get good with this, then spend some money on a Stigma or Swiss made rotary.</li>
