<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Slightly difficult to apply because I can&#x27;t seem to get enough product onto the brush. This is after one use, so that may change as the mascara is used more. Smells great. Color is a slightly darker brown than I expected, more of an espresso or almost a brown/black, but it&#x27;s very nice. No smudges or flaking. Overall a great vegan mascara. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.  9.23.15, edited to add: This has become my favorite mascara. After a few uses, more product came out on the brush and it became easier to apply. Still no smudging or flaking, even though I&#x27;m at the end of the tube now. This is the most natural-looking mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my lashes look soft and full, NOT caked like most other mascaras. My lashes stay flexible with his mascara on, not stiff and spiky like most other mascaras. I&#x27;m glad the color ended up being a dark espresso shade rather than closer to the photo (which makes it look like a medium warm brown). The color is the warmest dark brown I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s perfect for me. I can cry a bit while wearing it -- tears running down my face, sniffling -- without it running, but if you go into a full-on ugly cry, all bets are off and you get the full Alice Cooper. But it&#x27;s not advertised as waterproof, so that&#x27;s fine. Altogether an excellent mascara that I&#x27;m just about to buy again. Oh, and make sure Ecco Bella is the supplier, it&#x27;ll be the most fresh that way. Ecco Bella is a fully vegan and cruelty-free company: http://www.eccobella.com/philosophy/ (nope I&#x27;m not affiliated with them)</li>
    <li> This is a very subtle mascara so if you already have decent eye lashes then you will probably like it as it gently accentuates your eyelashes. If you have smaller lashes and looking for volume and length then this is not the mascara for you. I have been searching for a more &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; effect mascara that is organic but sadly the two concepts just do not go hand in hand. I use this for my daily mascara at work and use a traditional chemical mascara for special events.</li>
    <li> love the little built-in mirror</li>
    <li> This mascara does all that it advertises, however, if you&#x27;re looking for fuller lashes this won&#x27;t do it for you. The product goes on smoothly and lengthens your lashes. No flakes and there&#x27;s no chemical smell. I have very sensitive eyes and this mascara does not irritate them at all. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a redhead so I have really light eyelashes and I wanted something natural looking because dark mascara just looks ridiculous on me. This mascara is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for! It doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge at all and the color is gorgeous. No complaints, I love it.</li>
    <li> This color goes great with my blond hair !!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wasted tons of money buying every sensitive eyes mascara on the market. Even tried all of the clinique mascaras with no luck. This is the ONLY mascara that doesn&#x27;t give me red irritated eyes. It does not crumble at all, instead it goes on like a thin layer of paint, which I have never seen a mascara do before. One coat lasts me all day and all night. If you have sensitive eyes you must try this mascara. I liked the brown so much that I&#x27;m ordering the black one right now as well. This will be the only mascara I ever use!</li>
    <li> I am fortunate to have found this in brown, as it is sometimes difficult to get this acceptable color.  This brown mascara looks good, it looks natural without clumps!  The mascara pulls out of the tube without clumps. It will lengthen enough and as you coat a little more, it remains easy to apply.  Washing it off is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As women gently age into their 40s or more, they need to realize that black mascara needs to be applied moderately, so go with brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An attached mirror!&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s neat is there is a mirror attached to the flat design of the tube.  Great for those who carry their mascara with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO smell that can be allergenic.  Brown is a good color, especially for the very-lite skinned women and for the darker skin, it blends in with dark eyes.  ....Rizzo</li>
    <li> I love that it is natural and it doens&#x27;t run easily nor does it flake off like some mascaras will. It makes my eyelashes look nice and darkens them nicely. This is one item I will purchase again, I found it very good, comfortable to wear and no reactions to it. I have had problems with some mascaras making my eyes sore and red (the skin around my eyes) but this causes no reaction at all.</li>
    <li> Finally, a mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many, many mascaras over the years.&lt;br /&gt;Even those that claimed to be \\&quot;hypoallergenic\\&quot; gave me itchy, swollen eyes. It got to the point where I simply gave up wearing makeup, with only the rare occasion beckoning me to risk eye irritation for the sake of beauty (not a good idea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now I can wear mascara and not experience any discomfort. Ecco Bella is the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for. It is a completely natural mascara -- NO irritating chemicals. I tried it (with some trepidation) and was pleasantly surprised to be able to wear it without consequence. There was no itching, no swelling and no redness of the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is a really lovely mascara. It goes on very smoothly without producing clumps and it feels light and cool to my lashes. It is a subtle mascara and preserves a natural look while enhancing the eyes. I love the bottle--it comes with a little built in mirror on the side, just in case I need to make an impromptu application somewhere. The price point seems right to me. It&#x27;s not cheap but not overly expensive and it&#x27;s worth every penny knowing that I&#x27;m wearing something that looks great, feels natural and it won&#x27;t hurt my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;((review written by my wife))</li>
    <li> I have had quite the time looking for a decent mascara.  One of my main deisres is for it to be clump-free.  I don&#x27;t know what other mascara manufacturers don&#x27;t understand.  I want a natural look.  I don&#x27;t want be over made up yet I want fairly good coverage that doesn&#x27;t irritate my fairly sensitive eyes.  Ecco Bella delivers very well on two out of three, does fairly well on the third.  It does not clump and flows on so smoothly, almost like butter, gently, what a pleasure to put on each morning.  It does not make me look overly made up nor does it give me raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  That said, I have thin eyelashes and would like a little more coverage. I like the fact that natural products are used without the chemicals of most mascaras. The best I can say about Ecco Bella is that I like it so much that not only have I been wearing it every day since I received it, I will be buying it again.  ADDENDUM:  My 20-something daughter recently visited, saw this mascara, borrowed some and LOVED IT. She is very fussy about the clothes she buys and the beauty products she uses. She immediately reminded me that her birthday is coming up and this would make a perfect gift.  This is a far better recommendation that I could have given for it as a 50-something grandmother.  Definitely a high recommendation.</li>
    <li> The text is simple and restricted to the name of the mascara.  Difficult to tell what is unique about it and why I should buy it.  The bottle is slender and small and would fit nicely in a small purse.  The mirror on the back side is a nice touch, the perfect size and effective for applying mascara on the go.      The brush is fairly standard, though the pile is on the thicker side.  The chocolate color is also pleasant, but standard.  The liquid appears to be a little bit clumpy.  The combination of the thicker pile of the brush and narrower opening of the bottle causes the mascara to build up on the outside edge of the opening, as the brush is plunged in and out during application.      The product however, coats the eyelashes nicely.  There are few, if any clumps, and the lashes are separate.</li>
    <li> I found this product, and wanted to try it, due to the description.  After the product arrived, I was listening to an NPR program which described what is in most Cosmetics (scary stuff).  Some cosmetics, such as mascara, have particles of teflon and other fillers which give them a shiny effect, or substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially after learning what is in most cosmetics, I am very interested in this line of mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest listening to the NPR special or looking up information, because you will appreciate the concept and ingredients of this product much more if you understand why this product has been developed.  Who wants teflon in their eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will thoroughly review this product, after more experimentation.</li>
    <li> Love the more natural list of ingredients in this product, and am so glad to find a decent brown mascara. I am very fair, with very long, pale lashes, and I may? be the only person in the world that prefers the lightest touch of mascara possible &amp; I don&#x27;t want my lashes to be lengthened any longer.   So while I truly liked this product, it actually had a little too heavy of coverage for me.  I find myself wiping and wiping most of it off the applicator and even a little more off my lashes before it dries.  So I think I actually prefer the Neutrogena Clean Lash Tint [lash darkener only] I used before.  Still deciding if I&#x27;ll go back to that once I&#x27;m done with this tuble.</li>
    <li> Like the subtle color. Doesn&#x27;t bother my ultra dry, very sensitive eyes at all. The only problem is that it does flake. A lot.</li>
    <li> I have terrible allergies, so I decided to try a new eco-friendly mascara in hopes that it would end my itchy eyes. While this mascara doesn&#x27;t plump up my lashes as well as some other brands, it still does a nice job making them dark and defined without making me itch. It&#x27;s a great, natural look when applied yet does a nice job making my blonde lashes pop.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara because I initially thought it was eco-friendly (but it has parabens) and although it was my first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara to try, it is also the first to irritate my eyes.  I do wear contacts but I have never had a mascara irritate my eyes before (I&#x27;ve always used drugstore brands).  I gave it 2 stars because it did last all day without any residual mascara under my eyes and it only started to irritate around the 8 hour mark.</li>
    <li> I bought it on a recommendation for red heads.  It&#x27;s OK but not great. By the end of the day, I had brown smudges under my eyes.  At night it took a little work to get it all off.  Over all its just OK.  Still looking for a great color for red heads.</li>
    <li> At first I had written a negative rating.  The mascara came out almost like clay and tended to flake.  After several uses, I got frustrated and &amp;#34;stirred&amp;#34; the brush in it which seemed to spread the moisture more evenly.  After that, I&#x27;m in love with the mascara.  I&#x27;m a redhead with extremely sensitive eyes.  I use a base of clear mascara to brush the lashes up, then use the ecco bella mascara.  At least for me, seemed to keep everything out of my eyes, so they didn&#x27;t have a chance of getting irritated.  When they say it&#x27;s not waterproof, it&#x27;s not.  I live in rainy Seattle and many times I&#x27;ve come back from a walk to see that I look like a goth nightmare.</li>
    <li> My review title tells my biggest complaint with this mascara.  In all my days of mascara wand wielding, I&#x27;ve never dealt with a product that is so prone to clumps and the dreaded tarantula eye look.  I&#x27;m chalking it up to the nature of the brush and my own lack of skill after using anti-clump mascara for so long.  A base prep coat really helps with this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this. I purchased the mascara in brown and love the color and how smoothly everything goes on (save for those darn clumps).  And this truly does have some incredible staying power that doesn&#x27;t flake as much as the more expensive department store brands--awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I suppose this is one of those reviews where the good and bad cancel each other out.  If you&#x27;re good at putting on mascara, I recommend this.  If you&#x27;re like, you might want to find another product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mascara, doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive eyes any irritation, and looks very natural. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, only because it takes what seems like a very long time to dry, and often I find myself wiping away smudges left on my upper eyelid. Overall a really good product though. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> So I forgot to read the color line on this product, and I wear black mascara rather than brown. That was my first problem with this product. That being said, I&#x27;ll never wear it, but I still put it on to sample the product. This mascara is pretty good. It adds length without making my lashes extra clumpy. Combined with my handy dandy eyelash curler, I looked pretty fierce when all was said and done. I&#x27;d recommend this mascara to someone who uses brown mascara, otherwise, I&#x27;ll stick with old faithful--Maybelline Volume Express.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what I did like about Ecco Bella.  It wasn&#x27;t goopy like a lot of mascara can be.  It didn&#x27;t clot or cause my lashes to clump. It went on smoothly and I could hardly tell it was there.  It came off as easily as it went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I didn&#x27;t feel like it made my lashes feel or look longer or nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a simple straightforward product that I would wear as an everyday mascara but I would use it in combination with others if I was attempting to achieve a \\&quot;sexy eyes\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic and natural and for these reasons alone I would recommend it for everyday use.</li>
    <li> At the time that I received this product, I had also just purchased a mascara from Mary Kay and Cover Girl.  Of the three, I would definitely choose the Ecco Bella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with the other two products is that they both worked fine for the first week or so, but after that they got clumpy and globby and messy.  I used the Ecco Bella for several weeks in a row and it always went on smooth.  The color is a nice dark brown and the applicator has a little mirror on the side.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a natural product and the color is good. It seems like it never dries and smears easily. The mirror on the product is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older, my eyes have become very sensitive making it difficult to wear eye makeup. I have experimented with nearly every brand I could get my hands on ending up throwing yet another tube into the trash after 2 uses.  I was leery of trying another mascara and resolved to just accept my \\&quot;older\\&quot; eyelashes just as they are.  For some reason, Amazon put ecco bella&#x27;s black mascara in my daily Quick Picks one day.  I wasn&#x27;t interested in the black mascara but the idea of trying a natural mascara was intriguing so I ordered the brown.  I like it so much that I am now purchasing it through Amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this mascara for a few months, there is only one con that I have experienced.  It has a tendency to get goopy quicker than its chemical laden counter parts.  For eye health and safety reasons, it is recommended that mascara be changed out every 3 months.  I have found that starting a new tube every 2 months pretty much resolved the goopy issue.</li>
    <li> Best brand mascara! No clumps, nice amount of product on brush, separates lashes beautifully! Not waterproof though. Been using in both brown and black for ten years and don&#x27;t plan on changing! Thanks Ecco Bella!</li>
    <li> not what I was hoping for - looking for a substitute for a high end mascara  - guess that is why you pay more</li>
    <li> Mascara, powder, and lip gloss are pretty much it for my daily make-up routine, so I need them all to be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara went on very silky smooth, and stayed on through a work-out and showering two kids (steamy bathroom conditions) without moving. However, it came off quite nicely when I washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would normally buy black mascara - I have dark brown hair, brows, etc. - but this brown works quite nicely, giving nice coverage and enough drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package has a little mirror on it - handy for touch up application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this mascara is that the Cosmetic Safety Database lists it as one of the safest mascaras on the market.  Also on the plus side is that the mascara itself looks really pretty and natural, definitely darker than no mascara at all, but considerably lighter than the black, curling, lengthening mascaras that I am used to (e.g., Chanel Extreme Lash or Prescriptives False Eyelashes).  Those latter type of mascaras also tend to do a lot of the work for you when you put them on, that is you don&#x27;t have to work terribly hard to coat your lashes and you don&#x27;t need any kind of curler.  It definitely takes longer to put the Ecco Bella on, and you can&#x27;t get a dramatic look even if you try.  It looks more like you have lashes that have been dyed fairly dark and it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing mascara.  It&#x27;s a really pretty and natural look and I quite like it for daytime as well as casual evenings especially given its low toxicity.  For those big evenings out, however, there will still be a place in my makeup drawer for dark, dramatic mascara.</li>
    <li> I am not normally a mascara wearer - I hate the clumping and flaking, especially because I wear contacts. I *adore* the shade of brown of this mascara, as it is just a lovely subtle color enhancement and it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like my 16 year old step-daughter with the dark \\&quot;racoon\\&quot; eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this isn&#x27;t full of chemicals is a HUGE plus for me. I don&#x27;t like makeup that smells like a chemistry lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually started to wear this mascara on a daily basis, that that is saying something!</li>
    <li> I had never used this before.  I choose not to purchase makeup that has harsh chemicals.  I chose this product because the price was lower than other brands -  it worked great!</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money!!!!  Somehow this mascara made my lashes look worse than they do in their natural state.  It does nothing to improve or enhance your eyelashes.  I&#x27;m all for being eco-friendly and buying \\&quot;green\\&quot; products.  However, I still expect them to serve their purpose and this did not. And, while it did not leave me with \\&quot;racoon\\&quot; eyes as another reviewer mentioned, it did leave brown smears beneath my lower lashes by the end of the day.  Would never buy this product again and would not recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara.  It does not make my eyes sting and it&#x27;s so natural after it&#x27;s applied.    There are so many mascaras out there that when I use them, my eyes start stinging, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fumes or some sort of chemicals.  This mascara does not do that to me.  Highly Recommend!!</li>
    <li> Very clumpy. had to return it.</li>
    <li> Ecco Bella Brown Mascara. Sometimes I want to achieve a natural look and don&#x27;t want to use a black mascara, and that&#x27;s how I decided to purchase this one in brown, it&#x27;s very pigmented and it has a nice brush.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde with a fair complexion and I prefer not to wear heavy make-up. This brown is perfect - not too dark like the typical black/brown option. It also goes on very smooth, feels lightweight (for mascara, anyway), and looks natural.</li>
    <li> This product was reviewed by my wife who found the mascara to accent  her eyelashes beautifully. It is not irritative and comes off neatly and cleanly. It is all that can be expected from an excellent mascara.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, smooth mascara. There are no clumps, either on the brush or on your lashes, so you don&#x27;t have to waste mascara by cleaning the brush before using it. The color is very nice, and gives a natural effect.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are healthy and natural. The mascara washes off easily, and doesn&#x27;t smudge or give you those panda eyes (ladies, you all know what I mean). I have never had trouble with sensitivities to eye makeup, so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but I notice that other reviewers have been happy with this aspect of the product.&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, it&#x27;s good mascara. My favorite thing about this product, though, is the mirrored case. We see these usually for lipstick, which requires touchups during the day. But there are those days when we run out of the house without doing our eyes and then regret it later, and those days when we go straight from the gym to work -- not to mention traveling light for weekend trips. Drop a tube in your purse, and you&#x27;ll be ready for anything.</li>
    <li> I found this mascara to be delightful with its soft brown color and its ease of application. It doesn&#x27;t clump up or come on too strong; it simply enhances your lashes in an unassuming way. It&#x27;s not the mascara you would choose for your \\&quot;big night out\\&quot;, if you were walking the Red Carpet, hoping to win an Oscar (it isn&#x27;t dramatic enough), and it isn&#x27;t the mascara you would choose if you were planning to go to a real tear jerker of a movie. It isn&#x27;t waterproof, so you&#x27;d be caught at a sad movie with that awful messy runny marscara look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it has some neat reasons why I do like it, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, as I said, I like the color very much. I normally wear black mascara, but it&#x27;s nice to change to a soft color like this. It will go with some of my nude shades in eye shadows which I have already bought for the upcoming summer months. Also, it has a little mirror on on the applicator. This is something I have never seen on any tube of mascara. It is a rectangular shaped mirror on one side of the application tube, and it could come in handy to help you apply or touch up. Very innovative and clever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy trying new makeup products as I love make up. This mascarca by Ecco Bella is a fine addition to my collection of make up.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. Most products I&#x27;ve used get clumpy and end up under my eyes. This product goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Great product! No clumps and no bad stuff to hurt your eyes. It&#x27;s one of the safest mascaras on the market. Priced right too.</li>
    <li> This mascara is that perfect shade of brown, not too dark and not so light that it can barely be seen. A great alternative to the usual black, this product doesn&#x27;t smear or streak and stays put for up to six hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;This made my lashes look longer but not thick (like the Minnie Mouse effect). This is why it looks good for daywear - not too overdone. The comb does not clump up (I have had this product for 4 months now) after a while.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with my new mascara! I just tried it today and I had to write a raving review! So many reasons why I love this :  natural color, natural ingredients, eco- conscious company, smooth application, lasting color, excellent coverage, great for sensitive eyes, and it is easy to remove. My absolute favorite mascara, and I will purchase it in black also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a lot of volume mascara, but it is what I need for a natural look. Sometimes I forget I am wearing mascara and rub my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t cause a black eye. :))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty concerned about the chemicals in the products I use - especially products close to my eyeballs - so it&#x27;s great that this is one of the safest mascaras available. However it&#x27;s also the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used - goes on easily (1 coat), is relatively water-resistant, the brush works well, and the color is perfect. Since I don&#x27;t wear any makeup besides this, the color has to be natural enough but still make a difference and this stuff fits the bill. Hard to find in stores but that&#x27;s why we have the internet.</li>
    <li> This is a great, healthier alternative to the stuff you buy in most stores. It&#x27;s a pretty basic mascara, but I feel good about wearing it. It stays on all day, yet isn&#x27;t hard to remove.</li>
    <li> I like it; it&#x27;s rated as less harmful than others, and it looks nice and goes on easily. I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde with blue eyes and blonde eyelashes. The shade of brown is nice, gives my eyes a little pop, though it&#x27;s subtle, not dark enough for nighttime. The downside is it&#x27;s gone after a few hours. I may be changing soon, but this is good if you&#x27;re looking for something safer that goes on easily with no clumping.</li>
    <li> Finally a mascara for red heads in brown.  Loving it so far, bought two at a time so I will not run out.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural mascara and I found it. Does not irritate my eyes at all! You can almost wash it off in the shower with a little soap. Its stays on and doesn&#x27;t flake all over your face. Goes on real smooth. The mirror on the back side is really nice but a little bit of a warped image, because its plastic. Doesn&#x27;t get the weird smell like the others do when it is time to trash them. Will not use any other now. Love it!</li>
    <li> It is nice mascara.  But, I was looking for a true brown mascara and this is not it.  It still looks black when you put it on.  I bought it for my daughter who has almost white eyelashes.  Black mascara looks too harsh on her.  We had high hopes for this, but it looks almost as dark as the black mascara it replaced.</li>
    <li> This mascara comes in a lovely medium brown color that would go perfectly with light brown and blonde hair. As advertised, it has none of the clumps that so many other mascaras have; it goes on smoothly and looks more natural than most.  I have found, though, that it&#x27;s easy to end up with a drop or two of it on an eyelid or under the eye, so I work on trying not to blink too much when I&#x27;m applying it. Multiple applications stay clump free, and once dry, the mascara won&#x27;t smudge. Also as advertised, it&#x27;s easy to remove. I like the case too--it has a nice little mirror on the side that&#x27;s perfect for lipstick application. Try it!</li>
    <li> For those with sensitive eyes and skin, it&#x27;s essential to find mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump excessively and that refrains from irritating the eyes. While skin sensitivities are clearly a highly personal and unique matter, Ecco Bella Brown mascara was the first mascara that has ever worked for me without in some way causing irritation to my skin and eyes. I am also thrilled with the ease by which I am able to control how much mascara is applied at any one time, so there is no risk of clumping lashes together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is the perfect color to complement my eyelashes, and I found it even works as a means for coloring sun-bleached eyebrows, when carefully applied in moderate quantities. It&#x27;s wonderful to know that this mascara is natural and organic... something that those with sensitive eyes and skin will rejoice in, as they are able to wear it free from pain and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ecco Bella brown mascara comes with a completely surprising and very delightful feature -- a mirror built right in to the side of the bottle, so it&#x27;s always easy to see how much mascara is being applied, even if there&#x27;s no wall mirror available at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ecco Bella Brown Mascara is the perfect long-lasting, non-irritating mascara for blondes and light brunettes who wish to be able to carefully control the amount of mascara they apply without clumping. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Not a bad item nothing amazing but it is nice to have a brown mascara that is ecco friendly. The mirror attached to the body was nice too, I&#x27;d say that was probably the best thing about this product as far a useablity and quality. It is also water resistant which as someone with sensitive eyes like me, is a must.  We are only talking about mascara here so you really can&#x27;t be too excited or gushing about such an item. But it was a good item something I may buy when I finish the first bottle.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a mascara snob - for a variety of reasons.  I have incredibly sensitive eyes, and at the first hint of flakiness,  I start to cry.  Quite a few very expensive mascara&#x27;s have failed me in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara went on beautifully,  just one coat and you&#x27;re done,  lovely lush colour,  I was really impressed,  it&#x27;s definitely brown,  but so rich,  it doesn&#x27;t feel like black&#x27;s poor cousin,  it felt like it was a colour choice in it&#x27;s own right.  I really like this mascara and will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t smudge,  flake,  burn, and did thicken and lengthen my lashes. And it had a great rich shade - what more can you want from a mascara!</li>
    <li> Love this formula. I&#x27;m not a heavy mascara fan, I don&#x27;t like thick coating formulas, spider eyes, or black mascara which in general  is just too harsh for most people&#x27;s faces. This brown is perfect, darkens the lashes in a very natural way, doesn&#x27;t look heavy or fake. It stays on all day with no smudging or flaking. Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricier than the drugstore varieties, but it&#x27;s a formula you can feel good about and if you feel similarly to me in your approach to mascara, it&#x27;ll be perfect for you.</li>
    <li> I like the brown. I am very happy to have a softer (than black) color and love that Eco Bella products are made with health in mind.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the reasonable pricing and the ability to add things together in orders on Amazon to get free shipping.</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara that I have used that has a mirror on the side of the container, which unfortunately due to my aging eyes wasn&#x27;t used. The color is very natural looking. It goes on evenly without clumping or flaking nor did I experience any smears or allergic reactions. It stayed fresh looking and then removed easily with soap and water. I&#x27;m pleased that more  cosmetic companies are changing to healthier ingredients. This is the ONLY mascara that I&#x27;m aware that has taken this step. Based on the quality of this product, I will try other products by this brand.</li>
    <li> This mascara is everything I wanted. The shade is in a very hard-to-find brown. As a light brunette who is very pale, I look like a goth hooker in black mascara. The shade is perfect...makes my lashes stand out without being jarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for a week and have had no clumping or smearing. It lasts all day and washes off easily. I&#x27;m sensitive to fibers that irritate my contacts ...I&#x27;ve had no problems with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to design a mascara, this would be it. I would have liked the ingredient list in a permanent form. This costs about 2/3 less than my prior mascara (Chanel brown)and I like it much more. I would definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> All I can say is \\&quot;Wow, I&#x27;ve got to get this mascara in black as well as brown.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ecco Bella Mascara is just as important for what it leaves out as what it puts in.  The mascara color comes from clays and iron oxides but does not include lacquers and alcohols.  Therefore, it goes on smoothly without ugly clumping and comes off equally easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before trying this mascara, I knew nothing about Ecco Bella, a company that prides itself on avoiding animal testing and using ingredients unlikely to cause allergic reactions in people.  You might be interested in learning more about this company, so check out their website at eccobella.com for more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem?  It&#x27;s not available in my area (Dallas), so I&#x27;ll need to order from Amazon until some clever retailer (can anyone spell Macys?) decides to carry a full line here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve had problems with mascaras that clump like crazy or make your eyes itch, give this one a try. It might solve your problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> People said that the color was pretty light but it really is not that bad.  I am blonde and like a natural look but I can even pull this color off when I go with a smokey eye with black eyeshadow.  It is not really plumping but with multiple layers will give you a thicker look without being clumpy.  They key word here is layers if you want a dramatic lash. If you like mascara that does not clump this is the one.  Also this was listed as the least toxic mascara on one of those websites that tests for toxicity and cancer causing agents.  That is what sold me.</li>
    <li> Looking for gluten free make up? Ecco Bella delivers! Great coverage, rich and easy to apply without messy clumping. I work so one application and out the door. Washes off easily too. May not be suitable for pools or waterproof but  wanted I wanted for everyday.  I liked the mascara so tried the natural soft eye liner  pencil in bronze, too, (see my review) and was just as pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! It still looks good after a 12 hour shift at work, which is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it doesn&#x27;t feel dry or hard on my lashes. It feels so light that I will forget that I&#x27;m wearing it, and I&#x27;ll rub my eyes; Luckily it doesn&#x27;t smear easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually just use baby shampoo or diluted Dr. Bronners to remove it before I wash my face. I don&#x27;t know how it comes off so easily when I wash it, but doesn&#x27;t smear or come off while I&#x27;m wearing it at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am blonde and dark makeup looks even darker on me. This brown works well for my coloring. It&#x27;s a great mascara, and it&#x27;s vegan too!</li>
    <li> My wife is using this mascara for about 1.5 year. It does not irritate the eyes and is washed away without any problem with any face cleanser. Also, she noticed that eye lashes are not falling out when mascara is being wiped off the eyes.</li>
    <li> I think this is plenty thick if you curl your lashes first and then double coat. Jiggle the wand back and forth as you go out (increases coverage). It sure beats wearing a bunch of unhealthy chemicals that close to your eyes. And remember to discard all eye make up every 3 months (recommended) because bacteria tends to form in any eye products, healthy or not. I used Subscribe and Save set to 3 month re-ship to help me keep up with this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have negative comments to make about this product; somewhat disappointed in the applicator brush.  I would not purchase again as have found other products that work much better for me.</li>
    <li> ECCO BELLA&lt;br /&gt;FLOWER COLOR&lt;br /&gt;Mascara--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;Good Points-&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it a few times a week for 2 months and it hasn&#x27;t dried&lt;br /&gt;out at all.&lt;br /&gt;In fact it&#x27;s as juicy as the first day.  It doesn&#x27;t clump at all. Goes on&lt;br /&gt;smoothly and looks great with a light brown or pink eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for day ware-&lt;br /&gt;Great for on the go- I just throw it in my purse and, because of the&lt;br /&gt;mirror on the side, am able to apply it anywhere.  The mirror is the&lt;br /&gt;prefect size...just large and wide enough to see both eyes as you apply,&lt;br /&gt;but not big enough to change the small convenient size of the mascara&lt;br /&gt;bottle itself.&lt;br /&gt;Bad Points-&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it for the very conservative woman.&lt;br /&gt;You have to use several layers in order to get a semi thick effect.</li>
    <li> Long wearing, great coverage, and no flakiness.  I wear contacts and this didn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.  I purchased the mascara in black, not sure why Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry black.  This is the only brand I will purchase from now on.  I love that Ecco Bella has more natural ingredients than your standard makeup line.  Highly, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a true brown, so I love that.  But you won&#x27;t get the extension of some other mascaras (like Dior, Definicils or Buxom).  I&#x27;m not thrilled about the brush since it doesn&#x27;t really help to separate/define my lashes.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it is not easy to find brown mascara, and I&#x27;m sure glad I found this one.  This great mascara does not flake at all!  It has a good brush which makes it go on very easily and smoothly.  The tube has a little mirror on the back!</li>
    <li> Wanted mascara that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals and wasn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
    <li> The even non clumpy texture and rich brown-is perfect for my greying beard. It may be a bit light weight for some peoples lashes,but suits my beard and mustache well.&lt;br /&gt;I know this may seem a bit strange,but it encourages me to groom the details of my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I am not involved with many brand names in mascara,but have tried quite a few,and this one makes me look natural with it&#x27;s consistent texture.&lt;br /&gt;It would be even better if it were truly water resistant.</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the man who had the courage to admit to using this mascara on his beard.I must admit that I use it to tame and define my unruly eyebrows.Great product!</li>
    <li> Ecco Bella Brown Mascara is great!  Finally a mascara that goes on smoothly without that heavy clumpy look!  It has a softer look than most mascara&#x27;s.  I thoroughly enjoy it and will buy it again!</li>
    <li> methylparaben, propylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too much controversy surrounding these two chemicals, methylparaben and propylparaben for me to consider using this product.They have been banned in Europe for some time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louise Dawson</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend because she really knows make up. She&#x27;s also very sensitive to cheaper brands which make her break out. She tells me this mascara is not only easy to apply, but easy to remove. It stays on when she needs it. And I think it makes her dark eyes look just beautiful, so bonus for me!</li>
    <li> I switched to this product several years ago. I absolutely love the fact that it does not smell or feel like harsh chemicals. The teenage girl I mentor calls it my &amp;#34;flower power&amp;#34; mascara!  (She prefers all the chemical lengtheners and waterproofing, despite my counsel.)&lt;br /&gt;I have almost translucent blond eyelashes, and I am not looking for Raggedy Ann eyes, so this mascara is just the thing for me. I agree with a former reviewer; it is so nice not to have flaking during the day.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I caution people about is that it does easily come off with moisture...as in tears...rain...snowflakes...  I live in Maine, and we have a lot climate moisture. I have just learned to frequently run a gentle finger under the eyelashes on my lower eyelid to easily wipe away any color that has come off if I am snowshoeing or get caught in the rain or strong wind that creates tears. No worries for me! This may not be desirable for some, though, so I just want to be honest, so you do not waste your money. For me, practically chemical free is worth any inconvenience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this is that I simply use a soft cloth or organic cotton pad with water on it to remove it each evening. Again, no chemical removers to buy, carry for travel, or with which to harm my body!</li>
    <li> This is my new go-to daytime mascara.  It goes on easily, stays put, and doesn&#x27;t even make a mess if I forget to wash my face and go to sleep with mascara on.  I have sensitive eyes and this mascara does not irritate them at all.  It has a handy mirror on the side for application when you are not near a mirror.  Do not apply in the car while you&#x27;re driving!!! ;)</li>
    <li> This mascara is great for those who have blonde or reddish hair.  It&#x27;s a beautiful dark brown, and it goes on better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  No flaking or clumping, and it separates your lashes very nicely to give them an &amp;#34;enhanced-natural&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mascara for the second time and this is the only mascara that I can use. I have trouble with allergies all year and Ecco Bella is the only product I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause any problems with my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a nice medium brown, not almost black like most, but dark enough.  Goes on well, not clumpy.  Even has a mirror on the side!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched to natural mascara and am happy to report that my eyes no longer constantly water and sting. So that&#x27;s a win. This particular product is perfect for my tastes. Most of the time I wear very minimal makeup, like mascara and maybe a spot concealer, and this is just enough to highlight my eyes without looking overdone. The ladies I work with can&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;m wearing makeup most of the time, they just think I have movie star eyelashes. I&#x27;ve noticed my lashes have gotten longer, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that I stopped wearing the chemical stuff or if there&#x27;s something in this but I&#x27;ll take it either way. Tube&#x27;s been open almost four months and no clumping or drying, and this goes on great. Washes off with water but stays on with no flaking and minimal raccoon eyes. I usually do a quick swipe with a Kleenex at lunchtime and I&#x27;m good. Definitely buying more!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great color and goes on nicely and even has a handy mirror on the side of the bottle. However, it&#x27;s not waterproof, which is extremely annoying as I live in a rainy place and need to take care to not get any rain on my face or I will drip. Hey, company owners, please make a waterproof version! I&#x27;ll buy it for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> Severe clumping! Irritating to the eyes as the clumps come off in your eye as you wear it!! Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Brown is difficult to find.  Almost all mascaras available seem to be black/brown, not just brown so, this filled the bill nicely.</li>
    <li> This mascara has held up to Texas heat and a funeral and stays in place quite well.  I will order again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for a few weeks, and I really like it.  It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  It&#x27;s just enough to enhance my eyelashes without looking like I even have makeup on.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is a true brown, rather than a brown - black. For blondes and for older women it really soften the look.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product.  I have pretty strong chemical and fragrance sensitivities, so I have a hard time finding personal care products that don&#x27;t irritate in some way.  You&#x27;d think with only a handful of ingredients in this mascara, I&#x27;d have no problem wearing this without agitation.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Although the description says it is fragrance free, I can smell it, and it smells pretty bad.  I applied it anyway (still hopeful!), and within a few minutes my eyes stung and my nose and sinus area were red.  Sadly, this mascara is not going to work for me.</li>
    <li> Color is a nice, medium brown, looks natural, but does give body and color to lashes. Doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. I wouldn&#x27;t say it has great staying power but most natural mascara doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Got my &amp;#34;monies worth&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> this is a nice mascara but it may not be as thick as some people like I love that it is easy to remove</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, and generally don&#x27;t like mascara; specifically, the way a practically new tube turns into clump-city. This mascara doesn&#x27;t thicken (which wasn&#x27;t my goal anyway) but just adds a little bit of color and helps me look a little more polished when I need to.  Would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Very subtle color, but non-irritating, which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> The mascara is quite average. It does not enhance the lashes to the desired level, however it does not clump and does not smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest concern with this product is that it takes forever to wash it off. It smears and I had to use 5 cotton balls soaked in makeup remover to get it off my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably not order it again</li>
    <li> ...but not as much as some mascara does...it&#x27;s ok, but quite expensive..so I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I have very, very sensitive eyes and as I have gotten older, I use mascara to color my lashes which have gone white like my hair.  Non clumping is everything...this kind falls kind of in the middle.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews for the mascara, I was expecting more.  The mascara does do some clumping at the sides of the eye.  Also, It does smudge every time I have worn it. My eyes tend to start watering after 3-4 hours.  I will not order this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara after looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.  It was great for the first few months - it didn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.  The most difficult part was that it would smudge under my eyes and by the end of the day I just chalked that up to being a more natural formulation and didn&#x27;t have the chemicals from smudging.  However, recently, I&#x27;ve noticed that it doesn&#x27;t come off completely at night when I wash my face.  I&#x27;ve also had the mascara hurt my eyes when I put it on in the morning and they are irritated by the end of the day.  While I can&#x27;t 100% say that the make up is to blame, I do believe that it is a major factor and will have to find a new mascara.  Too bad.  It was easy to apply and looked good once it was on.</li>
    <li> First mascara in years that my eyes don&#x27;t feel like someone poured a bad of sands in them. I can finally use mascara again. This is a perfect product for really sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Very basic brown mascara with simple and gentle ingredients. It darkens and separates my lashes, but doesn&#x27;t do a lot of thickening. I also don&#x27;t need to use an eyelash comb or brush to separate or remove clumps, it&#x27;s pretty easy to apply it without clumps as-is. I do take issue with the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that it&#x27;s water resistant; I&#x27;ve had it get quite smudged all over my upper and lower lids while walking in the snow, crying definitely makes it run, and I wouldn&#x27;t dream of wearing it to the beach or pool. I&#x27;m not sure what other contexts &amp;#34;water resistant&amp;#34; would come into play, but I&#x27;m fine with it being water soluble. Makes it easier to wash off.  It washes off easily with a basic foaming cleanser and water. I&#x27;ve repurchased this several times, and will likely continue to do so. The little mirror does get scuffed up in my purse, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be a problem - it&#x27;s still usable for a quick application when it&#x27;s time to replace the tube anyway.</li>
    <li> I very much like this product.  I have tried a couple of other organic mascara products, and they either flaked, or smudged by the end of the day.  This one gets a little thin by the end of the day, but no flaking into my eyes, and I didn&#x27;t experience smudging.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I found this item to be dried out and probably old stock.</li>
    <li> I tried this twice to give it a chance. Both times it flaked onto my cheeks. If a mascara does that then it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! Over the years I have become super sensitive to beauty products and have had to go as natural as possible.  When my allergies are at their worst, my eyes water like crazy so I was forced to wear waterproof mascara to avoid melting.  But, now that I&#x27;m a woman of a \\&quot;certain age\\&quot;, I have really wanted to tone down my make up, but not completely go without since I have very fair skin and hair.  I no longer wanted to use black or even black/brown mascara as they were starting to look too harsh on me.  It was very hard to find just brown mascara, and, even harder to find it in a hypoallergenic product.  I ran across Ecco Bella Brown Mascara at my natural food store and decided to take a risk.  How wonderful it looks!  My eyes stand out without looking too overdone.  The brown gives my eyes a softer, more natural look but my eyes don&#x27;t look plain either.  It does not run when my eyes get watery, but yet it comes off perfectly when I go to remove it, unlike the waterproof mascara which got dry and hard by the end of the day.  I highly recommend this mascara and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have very few makeup options due to allergic contact dermatitis. I have very sensitive skin &amp; eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara does exactly what it says it will. I absolutely love it and it&#x27;s the only brand I use now.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, or you&#x27;re looking for a more natural &amp; cruelty-free product try this mascara!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this mascara,, I could not find brown shade in any store!  It&#x27;s a little more than I would spend on make-up. But well worth the price--the application is very smooth, no smudges and looks very natural-will definitely purchase again--</li>
    <li> I used them as directed, but did not notice much of a difference - not sure if I should have left them on longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive eyes and could never wear contact lenses comfortably. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I increasingly couldn&#x27;t tolerate most mascara brands. However I need to wear make up for a professional look. I&#x27;m happy to have found this brand. I can wear it for several hours and it does not flake.</li>
    <li> The color is nice but do to my reaction  I&#x27;m asking to return product.  Still on the hunt for a good brown mascara.</li>
    <li> Great.  It is hard to find brown mascara.  I am a red head with very fair skin, so black is out.  This stays on till I take it off, even waterproof mascara usually makes me  like a raccoon and it is very genital.  No problems with contacts, and I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon. Thanks for a great product</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara. It&#x27;s hard to find a true brown mascara, and this one is lovely. Goes on evenly, washes out easily. No nasty fibers to get into your eyes, no need to purchase products specifically for removing mascara. Yes, when I cry, it runs, but I don&#x27;t much care because cleanup is easy. The ingredients are gentle. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I received the item and it was shipped to me very quickly. The item was just as described. Thanks to all.</li>
    <li> This mascara formula is PERFECT for sensitive people and has VERY FEW ingredients.  Also, the color is perfect for light skinned, blondes who don&#x27;t want big dark black eyes!  I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I am blonde with light lashes and am always on a quest for brown mascara that is really brown, not black.  This is a superior product since it is not clumpy in application and does not make your lashes feel stiff.  I use waterproof mascara to take it off since it really does stay on well with no raccoon eyes</li>
    <li> As a fair redhead, I really like this mascara.  It is so hard to find brown in the drugstore anymore and sometimes black is a bit too dramatic.  This color is nice and subtle which gives me the look of being a bit more put together without much effort.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few years now, it&#x27;s subtle but noticeable and prefer the more natural ingredients over mainstream brands. I have very sensitive eyes/frequent irritation and have this on auto-order so that I can replace monthly.</li>
    <li> I have other health issues that result in super-sensitive eyes. I like this mascara and find it to dry quickly enough. However, it isn&#x27;t very waterproof and I had to quit using it on my lower eyelashes to prevent smudging. Still, I can wear it on the top lashes which is more than I can say for any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried lately! Also, it looks really natural and lasts most of the day (I&#x27;m talking 16 hr days). It also is almost clump-proof due to the liquid nature of the product.</li>
    <li> Though the mascara has a lovely, warm brown tone, it may not be fresh because it clumps a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is kind to the lashes - no harsh ingredients.  Good price, too.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great for me, who does not wear alot of makeup and wanted something that accentuated my eyes without being overly bold. The brown works well with my hair color and complexion. There is some slight clumping I notice when I try to put it on, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time. Simple, affordable,basic mascara with a cool little mirror going up the back of the tube. Lasts a long time if you don&#x27;t need a lot of lash cover at a time.</li>
    <li> Other drug store mascaras were irritating my eyes. This one does not. It goes on with little clumping. I just want to darken my lashes and am not worried about length so this suits me well.</li>
    <li> This brown mascara is too light in my opinion and it runs with the least little bit of moisture in your eyes.  Pretty soon you have no mascara on or streaks under your eyes.  I wore it once and threw it away.  I was very disappointed after all the good reviews I had read.  It&#x27;s not for me!  Purchased it because I want to wear make up with healthy ingredients.</li>
    <li> Product is very good and easy to apply.  Charge for shipping is costly.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. Doesn&#x27;t clump or flake. And it comes in a true brown.</li>
    <li> This has been the worst and most expensive mascara. It leaves big clumps and I had to discard it.</li>
    <li> I just wish I would have read a little more reviews before I bought it.  I searched for \\&quot;organic mascara\\&quot; and this came up.  The ingredients contain methylparaben and polyparaben.  So I&#x27;ll use it for a month then I&#x27;ll toss it and do a more thorough search next time.</li>
    <li> I am very fair skinned and really appreciate that the brown is actually brown and not almost black.  I am also not allergic to this at all, while other mascaras often make my eyes itch.  I don&#x27;t like heavy make-up of any sort, so I appreciate that I can apply this lightly without clumping.  However, if you want heavy, dark, mascara to make a big statement, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.  Even though I like that I can apply it lightly, I do sometimes need to reapply it after work if I&#x27;m going out that evening, because it is subtle.  It&#x27;s also easy to remove.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Satisfied with the results for a couple of years.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It is nice to have a more natural mascara available that performs just as well as one that has ingredients in it that are not needed and can be harmful to us and/or the environment.  I have very dark brown hair and brown eyes and lashes.  Until now I have always used black or black/brown mascara.  Ecco Bella brown mascara is a deep rich brown that accentuates my brown eyes and hair very nicely.    It comes off very easily while washing your face.  Give it a try, I think you will like it.  The packaging is exceptional with a mirror built into the side of it allowing for appliction where ever you maybe.</li>
    <li> Well, the good news is that it&#x27;s mascara, and it doesn&#x27;t suffer from any of the faults of bad mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t clump easily, it doesn&#x27;t run easily, and it washes out with just soap and water.    I prefer wearing natural products, and this one really fit the bill.  It&#x27;s taken precedence over other far more expensive products that I have used.    However, if you&#x27;re looking for magic mascara that will make your eyelashes look super-long, this is not the mascara you should choose.  There are no magic tricks to this one.  It&#x27;s just simply mascara, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> This mascara is very light weight and subsequently doesn&#x27;t give much volume. So, it isn&#x27;t good for those looking to \\&quot;extend\\&quot; their lashes.  However, it doesn&#x27;t clump, or smudge and the mirror on the side of the tube is nice. This would be good for women whose lashes are already long or for young ladies who are just starting to use make-up. The color is less dramatic than black, which also makes it nice.  It is a little on the expensive side for the amount/size of the tube, but if you&#x27;ve got sensitive eyes it is nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t for everyone, but for some it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> Ecco Bella mascara is better than most regular expensive products on the market and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals commercial mascaras possess. It gives a subtle coating for a natural look while lengthening your lashes and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave clumps! I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re tired of slathering your body in chemicals...</li>
    <li> Finally a mascara I can wear. Goodbye black cakey flakes under the eyes. Hello thick naturally looking eyelashes. I thought it was just me.</li>
    <li> This is a very good brown mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to flake very much if at all.  Recommend to others, yes.</li>
    <li> good mascara.  worked quite well.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever used. I have had a problem at times (but not with this purchase )of getting  this mascara that was too dry from various different places. Love that is is good for your lashes</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this company puts palm oil in this product (and also in their foundation.) A simple Google search will provide more info about how palm oils/waxes are destroying the homes of 2 types of orangutans to the point of near extinction. I&#x27;d like to try this product if they would use an oil that isn&#x27;t harmful to wildlife.</li>
    <li> I have been using all sorts of different over the counter mascara and was getting tired of the same results - clumping &amp; irritated eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Then I purchased Ecco Bella. I read a lot of reviews on line and thought I should give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! It goes on smooth, no clumping - and stays!&lt;br /&gt;It is a breeze to wash off and most of all: NO IRRITATION!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This mascara is easy to put on and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes. But it only stays on if you don&#x27;t do any activity at all. And you better not touch your eyes, sweat, shed a tear while peeling onions, or cry.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a brown mascara. I love that it is more natural than many drug-store products. I&#x27;ve been wearing this mascara for several years now. It&#x27;s basic mascara and works great. It is gentle around my eyes, and easy to wash off. Know that it is not water-proof. If you ever cry without wiping your eyes, it will look like a scary horror movie... just remember to use a tissue to wipe your eyes, and it will be fine. Aside from that, it lasts through the day. I don&#x27;t notice running from sweat or even being in the pool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for actually blonde mascara, and while this isn&#x27;t it, this is a really nice not-too-dark-brown mascara. It goes on nice and soft and feathery, no spider lashes.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with the performance of this mascara. I did find another &#x27;natural&#x27; mascara that I like better, hence the 4 vs 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> this is a very poor product. The mascara wont even go on. the brush is way too small. No &amp;#34;Good</li>
    <li> Applies nicely, its not clumpy or gloppy. This doesn&#x27;t seem like an appropriate statement to make but  it goes on clean.  Maybe it&#x27;s my subconscious telling me that because I know this mascara is cruelty free, I don&#x27;t know......  I LIKE - NAY LOVE - THIS MASCARA!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup but I&#x27;ve worn mascara for many years. I&#x27;m not a mascara connoisseur however, but I know what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I received a high end mascara as a Christmas gift (it was thrown in as a bonus with a face cream purchase), that stuff is terrible! My eyelashes could be on the &amp;#34;how NOT to apply mascara&amp;#34; website (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s an actual website BTW).</li>
    <li> This mascara rates a 5/5 stars for my purposes. I was born with large, pretty eyes and long eye lashes. I have hazel eyes, yellow skin, and golden blond hair. My eye lashes are naturally a dark caramel color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m starting a government office job where I have to wear a suit. I do want to look professional--not office sexy. So, I&#x27;m keeping my make-up really natural: powder, sheer pink blush, rose lip stain, and BROWN mascara. I&#x27;ve always worn Clinique High Impact or Armani oil-based black mascara if I go out or have a hot date. I&#x27;ve tried in vain to buy BROWN mascara. I&#x27;ve only been able to find black-brown or \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot;at pharmacies and walmart. They&#x27;re still awfully black-looking. So, after some online research I found Ecco Bella BROWN mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous reviews are fairly accurate. It&#x27;s brown. It&#x27;s natural. It&#x27;s water based. It works. I think that the complaints are funny since it is a water-based, natural, BROWN mascara. What are you expecting? Armani Eyes To Kill oil-based BLACK mascara? Puh-leez!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin, blue eyes, blond lashes...  I need brown mascara. I liked the naturally derived aspect of this but it makes my eyelases look baaaad.  Not in a clumpy way, more like if you can imagine using brown paint.  I do not like this.</li>
    <li> I like the organic nature of this mascara, very nice lasts all day. If you want to thicken the lashes this isn&#x27;t the produce for you, but lovely nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Burns my eyes slightly. Doesn&#x27;t lengthen at all, but does make my half-blonde lashes a bit more noticeable. Flakes if you use more than one coating. Long-lasting wear otherwise! It&#x27;s a so/so product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try brown mascara and didn&#x27;t want to splash out on an expensive brand. However this is one of those runny ones that doesn&#x27;t build volume. Also it tends to get onto your upper (and lower) lids before it dries if you blink. I will go for l&#x27;oreal again next time.</li>
    <li> I have tried many mascaras on the market. Cheaper and the more expensive. This is the one I have stucked with longer than other ones. It goes on great and doesn&#x27;t stain my eyelashes like many others do. I can actually wash it all off. There are a few times which I couldn&#x27;t remove it completely, don&#x27;t know why. But I am happy enough with it to continue buying it. Been using it for over a year now. The complaint I have though it seems to get thick and/or dryer after 3 weeks. There is plenty of the substance there but thicker and dryer. I wish it would last longer. I order it once a month through subscribe and save program. I bought one from the health store then started ordering it through Amazon. A little cheaper.</li>
    <li> Good color! Just what I wanted. But, it tends to clump a bit.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s just the right color for a natural look, and it&#x27;s animal friendly.  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of mascara trying to find something that will not flake. This is the best I have found. I use the brown for everyday and the black for special evenings out.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I have developed an allergic reaction to chemicals in most brands.  My eyes would water and become pink in a couple of hours.  Ecco Bella brand does not irritate eyes and can be worn all day, love it!</li>
    <li> rolls on, look natural ,no smell,makes lashes look longer, will order from now on and not expensive</li>
    <li> Color was great. Accompany, built in mirror is handy.  Mascara was very dry and hard to apply.</li>
    <li> it covers gray hair good, it does the work</li>
    <li> excessive mascara on brush, causes clumpy application. I would love to buy this again, I just don&#x27;t want to waste half the product. I have to use another brush to thin it out once applied. I wipe off the extra liquid in tube as well. Some liquid may get wasted due to drying near cap when I close the container. No smudging. The ingredients are great</li>
    <li> Out of all the \\&quot;organic\\&quot; ones, this one is a good pick. It delivers a decent amount of volume and you get next-to-no smudges.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I thought that it started glopping a bit early in the game.</li>
    <li> Finally a mascara for blonds and red heads.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have terrible reactions to most eye makeup, but this works for me.</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome.  Stayed on and on till I washed my eyes.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really nice for adding color and a tiny bit of shaping. I&#x27;m quite blonde, so I only use it for color and am pleased that my lashes otherwise look natural. This is definitely not the product for big flashy lashes. It also comes off with just soap and water, unlike most mascaras which require makeup remover.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite mascara I have ever had!  It looks natural and gives me just the right amount of length that I want.  My eyelashes even seem healthier and more full ever since I started using it.  It also doesn&#x27;t cause me any pain or itchiness as some mascara has in the past.  I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I have blonde eyelashes that are difficult to see without make-up, but I prefer a natural look. This mascara is just enough to give some color without looking like I have a ton of makeup caked on. Highly recommend for anyone in the same situation.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I stock it every six months. It&#x27;s a great color and reasonable staying power for being a natural product. I won&#x27;t be going back to other chemical-laden products again!</li>
    <li> I like the natural looking color of the Ecco Bella Flower Color Brown Mascara. A little more volume would be appreciated, is all.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and if you make a number of applications you can achieve a volume suited to a natural looking lash that&#x27;s perfect for day time wear. No problems with clumping. Did not smear or smudge. It&#x27;s relatively thin, just stir it up a little before applying.  ,&lt;br /&gt;If the product had a little more &#x27;omph&#x27; built in, it would save the time needed for careful repeat applications. I&#x27;m not sure you can get to a &#x27;dramatic&#x27; level with this product. I seldom have need of a dramatic look, so I&#x27;ll be happy to finish up this tube as I go on looking for a cruelty free mascara line in brown that delivers a little more volume.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - It goes on nicely with good definition. Make sure to let it dry a little before batting your eyes and afterward it won&#x27;t leave a trace on your upper lids, even in humidity or if you sweat! It&#x27;s not water-proof, though. It has never stung or burnt my eyes and the color is wonderful. It lasts a long time before clumping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this mascara. As a blonde it&#x27;s hard to find a mascara that looks natural, most mascaras go on too thick. I don&#x27;t wear any other makeup and I tend to look silly when only my eyelashes can be seen from a mile away, this mascara gives me a very light, natural look without overdoing it. It&#x27;s a great product for everyday wear. If you are looking for an all out dramatic look, this isn&#x27;t for you, if you are a blonde looking to not have invisible lashes, you&#x27;ve picked the right product.</li>
    <li> It does everything I wanted and nothing I didn&#x27;t want. This mascara darkens my lashes, period. No lengtheners or thickeners to glop up my lashes. No clumps. It goes on easily and washes off with warm water. It&#x27;s minimalist. Just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a truly brown mascara. This one is the perfect color for my light eyelashes. Looks very natural. This is also the only mascara I have ever had that does not clump. It goes on perfectly smooth. Just love this product!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, I really like this mascara.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and it never flakes off, and is easy to remove even though it is waterproof (I usually go for waterproof because I&#x27;m a contact lens wearer and have to put drops in my eyes every once in while).  But, I want to note that it doesn&#x27;t really make lashes look thicker, it just makes them more defined and longer, it makes my lashes look really natural.  Overall, I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara. I&#x27;ve just finished up my first tube of it and am excited to order another. When I went looking for my first natural mascara, I figured I&#x27;d have to make some concessions to get something without chemicals, but I actually prefer this to any mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Even at the very end of the tube, it has never once clumped. It goes on really smooth and stays put all day. After reading some other reviews, I will say that I tend to like a very natural look; if you&#x27;re looking for a more dramatic eye, this may not be the best. As a personal trainer that just wants to look a little fresh while I&#x27;m in the gym all day, it&#x27;s perfect. On that note, it has also never sweat off, which is a huge bonus for me.</li>
    <li> This one did not seem to burn my eyes as much as others.  Unfortunately, it goes on pretty goopy  and I have to use a separate eyelash brush to get off the excess... but it&#x27;s the only one I use right now because it irritates less.</li>
    <li> I like this even through it is not water resistant.  It goes on smoothly and is a perfect color for day time. I usually put on two coats.  I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 months, and there is no change in the smell or other sign of bacteria (like I often get with the chemical based mascaras).  I will definitely buy this again and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> was or my wife -- her favorite brand. She has multiple foods/ngredients allergies, and this brand of mascara works for her.</li>
    <li> I had not been able to wear mascara for many years, due to sensitivities. Ecco Bella is the answer. I can finally wear eye makeup again. The mascara does not clump or irritate my eyes, and has a very natural look.</li>
    <li> Looks brown until I apply it, then it looks black.  I had high hopes for this one as I was looking for something less toxic, but will go back to my non-black brown...</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this product it said fragrance free. When I received the item I opened it and it was a pretty brown color I loved the color. Then I smelled the mascara it was awful there was nothing fragrance free about this product. I called Amazon and the company made it right. I then bought my other mascara I have used before. NOTE: I never used the product because of smell so I can not comment on the applying of it.</li>
    <li> Since I have been aware of toxic chemicals in make-up I have been replacing all my make-up with high rated brand on EWG.  This was one of them.  I didn&#x27;t have any expectation of color so I was very happy with the natural look of my lashes after applying it.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a combination of my diet and cleansing routine but my eyelashes are long now and this mascara enhances them even more.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be great but I have a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I like this brown color.&lt;br /&gt;It is not easy to wear my eyes on the makeup.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara! I was looking for a brown mascara, and I was interested in this one because there are no harsh chemicals in it. I am impressed by it. It doesn&#x27;t flake. It lengthens and volumizes my lashes. I like too that the brown is so natural looking which is what I wanted. This is the first brown mascara that I&#x27;ve ever found that is really brown. Usually they look a little black to me. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color for a nice,  natural looking lash.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have found in a long time.  I always look for fiber-free, non-clumpy mascara. This one fits the bill perfectly.  It goes on very smoothly and evenly and no clumps or anything to clog my long lashes.  Looks very natural, which is what I like the most.  I doesn&#x27;t smear easily, yet washes off when you want to do that.  The color is a beautiful brown.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Would like it better if it cost less.</li>
    <li> Great natural product. THe color is perfect for y complexion, I&#x27;m a red head. It goes on smoothly and the brush works great too. Covers the lashes without making them look fake. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I switched to all natural makeup after becoming pregnant. I admit to using the super-charged, definitely-not-natural stuff previously, so perhaps I not the best judge. The mascara itself is very wet and if I&#x27;m not very careful in applying it, my lashes can go a little Tammy Fay. It wears off quickly too. There&#x27;s really no lengthening power to it (which the product doesn&#x27;t claim), so you really are getting a lash paint of sorts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this quick...was looking for a mascara that wasn&#x27;t filled with chemicals and that was on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database. It is impossible to find anything in stores so I was delighted that Amazon had what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a hard core makeup user or a connoisseur of cosmetics so my standards aren&#x27;t sky high. However, while this mascara doesn&#x27;t have any bells and whistles (lengthening, thickening, waterproofing, etc.), it works well, looks great, doesn&#x27;t readily run or smear and stays on for the whole day for me. And best of all, I know that the ingredients are good for me and good for the environment.</li>
    <li> Great color and stays on better than expected.</li>
    <li> I like the mascara, and how it wears.</li>
    <li> Love brown mascara, and it is tough to find.  This comes off easily with water.  If you are looking for waterproof, this is not for you.  I like its consistency, and no clumping.</li>
    <li> So far this is a great mascara. It&#x27;s very subtle, but pretty. It doesn&#x27;t cake, doesn&#x27;t smudge easily, and is non-toxic. I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Reading the previous reviews, I was looking forward to using this product; as a redhead I need a true brown mascara. The mascara itself is a true brown, however within hours of application all the mascara flaked off my lashes and ended up under my eyes. I didn&#x27;t realize until I got home from work that I&#x27;d been walking around with racoon eyes all afternoon. I do not recommend this, I had the same problems with the Just For Redheads products.</li>
    <li> Having finished chemo and radiation treatments I have become quite a &#x27;post cancer hippie&#x27; with regards to all of my personal products. I don&#x27;t want anything with a bunch of toxic ingredients. Once you really start looking at the ingredients list of products... well, it&#x27;s more disturbing that I ever realized. I use the EWG skindeep database and try for only products that score a 2 or below, but have a few that are 3 or 4. ([...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is about as perfect as you can find. It performs wonderfully for having no crazy crap in it. Yes it will run if you cry, but I look at that as a good thing, it&#x27;s not exactly normal for mascara not to run - I don&#x27;t want those chemicals on my body anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After MUCH research, trial and error - the natural beauty products I have happily settled on that are&lt;br /&gt;1)Low in toxic ingredients&lt;br /&gt;2)Still quality products that work well and&lt;br /&gt;3) Readily available on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001GIOV8M Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Serum]] (Toxin score: 1)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003TC5SM6 Juice Beauty Refining Finishing Powder]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000Z61VVQ Juice Beauty SPF 30 Tinted Mineral Moisturizer]] (Toxin score: 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000E3C024 Larenim Blush]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0049QV3KC SANTE All-Natural Eyeshadow Stick]] (Toxin score: 2, the blue, green, rose and pearl are all pearlescent, but the coffee, olive and white are more matte; the rose, white and pearl are good for highlighting.)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000US0804 Ecco Bella Mascara]] (Toxin score: 1)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0013OXEFU Lavilin Deodorant]] (Custom toxin score: ~3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00015XAQ0 Avalon Organics Vitamin C Cleansing Gel]] (Toxin Score 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0063I3RNA EO Everyone Soap Lavender and Aloe]] (Toxin Score: 3)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003EUR1D2 Kiss My Face Whenever Shampoo and Conditioner]] (Toxin score: 2)&lt;br /&gt;CoverGirl Outlast All Day Lipcolor (Toxin score: 4, not bad and the performance is worth it to me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful for others with the same intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/30 update - I decided to start a blog with all of this (and more as I go)- if you&#x27;re interested it&#x27;s at PostCancerHippie.com or facebook/postcancerhippieith the same intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/30 update - I decided to start a blog with all of this (and more as I go)- if you&#x27;re interested it&#x27;s at PostCancerHippie.com or facebook/postcancerhippie</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara.  The color is a true shade of brown, not black/brown like some mascaras.  I have dry eye(which, ironically, makes my eyes water like crazy to try and compensate for the dryness) so I need something that won&#x27;t run.  I also hate removing waterproof mascara, which can be another eye irritant.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara stays in place and does not run.  I usually only need water to remove it from my lashes, then a bit of cleanser to remove any of the residue if it runs down my face during removal.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the occasional raindrops hit my eyes and that didn&#x27;t cause the mascara to run or smear, but I&#x27;ve never been in a full on rain storm with this makeup on so I don&#x27;t know how well it would hold up.  Even if that would cause it to run I would still recommend, just with an umbrella!  Love this!</li>
    <li> This brown color matches my fair skin tone perfectly, not to dark without black tones. Brown blacks that I have bought in the store are to dark. On the down side, the mascara flakes and runs if rain drops get on your eye lashes. The price is getting to high also. I will be looking for another mascara, hopefully that won&#x27;t flake in the afternoon or run if rain gets on my eyes.</li>
    <li> I just plain adore this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure (and humblebrag) I have seriously long lashes, top and bottom, so I don&#x27;t need any additives in my mascara to lengthen my lashes.  As a red head, what I do need is mascara that isn&#x27;t black, that doesn&#x27;t clump, that doesn&#x27;t smear, that has a nice precise brush that allows me to coat each lash and make it look distinct, and that stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ecco Bella does all that, and has a mirror on the case!  How cool is that?!</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  This mascara goes on smoothly without &amp;#34;glops&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered this mascara 3x now.  Clearly I love it!  Doesn&#x27;t smudge, flake, or run.  I rub my eyes a lot and worry about the nasty chemicals getting in my eyes.  Ecco Bella doesn&#x27;t rub off below my eyes like other, traditional mascaras do.  Keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that the mascara starts to get clumpy after a few months, so I end up getting a new tube every 5 months or so.</li>
    <li> Nice color, not glaring.  Could be a bit darker for me.  Nice little mirror on one side. Comes off easily.</li>
    <li> I have problems with eye irritation like burning, tearing, redness with every mascara I use except for the Ecco Bella FlowerColor product line, It works perfect for me and I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive eyes</li>
    <li> I bought some in brown and it looked nice on my naturally blonde eyelashes BUT.....it irritated my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the irritation after the first application and wearing it for the day.  I then tried again a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both days, my lids, near where the lashes grow out were feeling allergic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to pitch the stuff in the trash and go back to Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiddlesticks.</li>
