      <li>It has somewhat of a sweet fruity smell that lasts throughout the day.</li>

      <li>one is so mellow, girly and fresh, all in one.</li>
      <li>Came in great condition and I loved the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very classy fragrance- fresh fruit, kind of makes me think of a classier version of Victoria&#x27;s Secret \\&quot;flirty\\&quot; pink grapefruit body mist.</li>
      <li>Package is the 2.50 ounces in a cool silver bullet shaped bottle as shown with pink liquid so its super nice for female gift giving with stylish packaging )  </li>
      <li>Its a light floral/fruity blend and scent is highly a RASPBERRY tone.  </li>
      <li>is fresh, floral, deep, striking and feminine.</li>
      <li>Not a sweet candy, not too outstanding but easy to get</li>

      <li>unless I soak up in it, it won&#x27;t last more than 4-5 hours in A/C environment, no winds.</li>
      <li>Its a good everyday perfume.</li>
      <li>very good,buy this product for my mother&#x27;s gift.</li>

      <li>I love the brand and some of its other scents</li>
      <li>Its a very beatuiful scent but do not expect the scent to last longer than two many three hours long.  </li>
      <li>This has been my new fragrance choice.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s light and does not last very long on the skin.  </li>

    <li> very good,buy this product for my mother&#x27;s gift. She was happy, &#x27;m also glad the product has pleasant smell,I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> i have a bottle, and bought one more before I switch to Burberyy&lt;br /&gt;this one is so mellow, girly and fresh, all in one. Not a sweet candy, not too outstanding but easy to get attraction.&lt;br /&gt;same as other review, it doesn&#x27;t last long enough as I expected for a perfume. More like EDT. unless I soak up in it, it won&#x27;t last more than 4-5 hours in A/C environment, no winds. It&#x27;s worse if you&#x27;re outside.&lt;br /&gt;This is suitable for young women in my opinion.</li>
    <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
    <li> I would definitely do business with this company again. Excellent and expidited service. I received my package before the expected date.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately was told the wrong brand of cologne by my friend after I had ordered this.  But I could not return it so I was stuck with it. I tried some and initially was not impressed ( just me and what scents I like) with it myself, but as it settled on me and dried out it smelled pretty good. Not to the point of the other one I was suppose to have purchased. I placed it on my skin and I have a body chemistry that makes some colognes smell worst, so I will try it again on just my clothing as I have found it to smell better when I do that. I will probably give this as a gift to someone tho and get what I really wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with Amazon tho. I ordered this cologne on Sunday evening and received at my door on Tuesday!!!! Great because I did not have to pay shipping nor extra for express mail!!!! So far,so good Amazon!!!! :)</li>
    <li> This scent has to be one of my favorites. It&#x27;s not overpowering at all. It has somewhat of a sweet fruity smell that lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> one of my favorites!. My wife love it.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered it.  Very happy both times.</li>
    <li> un perfume bien agradable para damas, excelente precio, la presentacion del producto me parece bien, comoda, para toda mujer que le guste los perfumes suaves</li>
    <li> I like this perfume. Its a good everyday perfume. It is a little flowery, generally I don&#x27;t like anything that smells like flowers but this one I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I am usually not into doing a lot of online purchases because you never know what to expect, but I was very pleased with the mechandise and on how quickly it was shipped. Especially since It was around Christmas. I would definitely do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> This scent has a striking resembelance to Cliniques Happy.  Its a very beatuiful scent but do not expect the scent to last longer than two many three hours long.  The problem with the white flowers other than gardenia is it does not last long at all.  For anyone who likes light scents and floral, this is the ticket.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Great for any time. Compliments galore. Excellent service. I love the brand and some of its other scents</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this as much as Guess by Marciano...it&#x27;s got a WOODSY scent to it...more for winter.  Use lightly-it is STRONG....</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for my sister&#x27;s birthday gift. for many years been used the same perfume. if she likes it because it&#x27;s good</li>
    <li> My favorite scent at an unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Guess fragrance as it is almost identical to the scent Guess had almost 20 + yrs ago which was packaged in a triangle vertical bottle and the perfume was an orange liquid.  Its almost the same scent but it&#x27;s light and does not last very long on the skin.  ( duration is about a 1/2 hour from when you apply this ) Package is the 2.50 ounces in a cool silver bullet shaped bottle as shown with pink liquid so its super nice for female gift giving with stylish packaging )  Its a light floral/fruity blend and scent is highly a RASPBERRY tone.  I highly recommend this fragrance if you&#x27;re looking for a younger fragrance as its not heavy or musky like \\&quot;old lady cologne\\&quot;. 5 stars as this is my favorite and its difficult to locate as its always out of stock at department stores.</li>
    <li> I like its smell and it stays for a long time on my skin and clothes. Its smell is more appropriate for night, at lest for my standards.</li>
    <li> Excelente el producto llego a tiempo a venezuela y en excelente estado lo recomiendo al 100% Gente seria y responsable pueden comprar con toda confianza</li>
    <li> i like this parfum and every guess item.  i decided to buy it and completed my expectations . really good</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!  I have purchased it several times &amp; love it every time I spray it on.  It smells soooooo good!!!</li>
    <li> Came in great condition and I loved the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very classy fragrance- fresh fruit, kind of makes me think of a classier version of Victoria&#x27;s Secret \\&quot;flirty\\&quot; pink grapefruit body mist.</li>
    <li> I think the product is not original, my previous scent lingered all day. This did not last even 10 minuntos, what you pay ...</li>
    <li> This has been my new fragrance choice. If you like citrus with a touch of fruit you will love this fragrance. It also last very long and I continue to receive compliments and get asked, what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. GO GUESS!!!</li>
    <li> I can not explain ... I love this fragrance ... is fresh, floral, deep, striking and feminine.</li>
