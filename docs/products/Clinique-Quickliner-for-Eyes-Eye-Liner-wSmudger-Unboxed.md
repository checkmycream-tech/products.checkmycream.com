    <li> I have been using this eye liner for years. I always bought it at department stores so i am so happy to pay about half price now finding this on amazon!</li>
    <li> Perfect eyeliner for me...a woman in her early fifties. I don&#x27;t want a harsh eyeliner and this product is perfect for that. It goes on smoothly and is easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I bought the dark chocolate color rather than black. I prefer a more natural look and this product really delivers.It stays on throughout the day and is easy to remove at night.</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for my mother, since i love clinique&#x27;s quickliner in black. she has watery eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t run on her. she&#x27;s given me positive reviews all around, though when i use it, i make sure to set it with eyeshadow (it smudges for me). works best, like most things do, with a primer!</li>
    <li> Same thing u get at mall. Been buying this eyeliner for years and would know if it were fake or bad version but its not. Exactly what I buy for 3 times the price at the Clinique counter. Will Always buy this from amazon from now on. Can buy it and something else for price of mall and gas to get there.</li>
    <li> I have the lightest blonde eyebrows in the world, so I have to draw them on. This is a perfect pencil for that. As far as an eyeliner - good luck. It won&#x27;t stay in place, and it won&#x27;t be even either.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t stsrted usug it yet, not until the old on is out. but i hsve tested it and it will be fin for me</li>
    <li> Glides on smoothly, nice rich color, does not come off easily, good for sensitive eyes, thank you so much! :)</li>
    <li> I wanted a dark chocolate color, but this seems to be too light.  I will use this one up, but will not buy it again.  I will look for a richer, more chocolatey brown.</li>
    <li> Like the product and use the whole line of makeup and skin care line.  Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and easy on the eyes as mine are very sensitive to makeup</li>
    <li> I used to buy Clinique quickliner at a local department store for almost three times the price of buying it unboxed from an Amazon vendor. What a deal! This eyeliner doesn&#x27;t require a sharpener, as it is dispensed by twisting the tube. That has prevented a lot of waste. Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily, and the color (dark chocolate) complements my eye and makeup colors.</li>
    <li> Item is not as described or in picture.  This is a smaller possible sample size product labeled not for individual sale. No smudger on end.</li>
    <li> Why buy Clinique eyeliner in town when you can get this great deal. I have ordered two and might get another.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on very smooth, no tugging and stays in place for the whole day.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I just don&#x27;t like this eyeliner, or if the product is old or what. I may just prefer the cream eyeliner, but this stuff was hard as a rock and really hard to use. Made me feel like I was in junior high again using  stuff from my grandmas expired mary kay hoard.</li>
    <li> This liner is great.  Goes on smooth and the smudge end is nice.  Like the dark brown also.  Have been recommending to my friends.</li>
    <li> great price for a clinique product. i&#x27;ve never used this kind of eyeliner so was happy to try it, plus I live for away from any Mall to buy the stuff.</li>
    <li> Veeeeeeeeery good pencil!  I used to paint eyes wuth black and grey pencils but recently I realized that these colors are too dark for daywear. So I ordered clinique&#x27;s quickliner and was PLEASANTLY surprised: it is very soft, easily drawn, does not get smeared and does not need sharpening!!!</li>
    <li> I did not get the box of 10; I should have because these are sample items. I didn&#x27;t realize this.</li>
    <li> Normally if I wanted to purchase Clinique eyeliner from a store the cost is insane, this product was so cheap I couldn&#x27;t believe it and it&#x27;s the exact same as the overpriced ones I buy at the department stores! Now I know where to go when my eyeliner runs out.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner and go to color. Great for work or for going out on a Friday night. Applies easily. No sharpener needed. One end can be used to &amp;#34;smudge&amp;#34;  Very very dark brown. Stays on all day. As with all Clinique products, great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love Clinique Quickliner For Eyes in Dark Chocolate, eyeliner.  It goes on easily, it lasts all day and this color is perfect for me, a real dark brown like espresso.  I have very fair skin coloring so I find black too harsh a color for me.  I am very happy with this eyeliner especially for these low prices. I don&#x27;t need the box that it usually comes in if it means getting this eyeliner at a greatly reduced price.  It is not a waterproof eyeliner but it lasts all day and does not run. It is easy to sharpen to a nice point with a sharpener.  It is even easy to take off with makeup remover. I have tried many other brands of eyeliner and like this one the best. I received my eyeliner quickly after I ordered it. I highly recommend this product, if you are looking for a great eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner because it&#x27;s easy to use and stays fast. It&#x27;s much more user friendly than most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It truly works for my dry skin eye-lids.  Goes on smooth as smooth can be.  Looks just the way I want my eye liner to look.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> Already had this great liner in another color and when I saw the deal on this, had to get it!  I have been a Clinique fan for years, quality stuff and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or eyes.</li>
    <li> Worth the extra money.  Goes on smooth.  Great color.  I have used it for a couple months now and it still seems to be the same length that I purchased it at.  So much easier than constantly sharpening a pencil.</li>
    <li> Best liner I have used !!!!!  Great price!!!!!</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth and particularly love the smudge sponge on the end of the pencil.  I also purchased the black.</li>
    <li> Best eyeliner color in brown ever ! Goes on easily too .</li>
    <li> No complaints... I always buy clinique and bought it because it was cheaper and I am satisfied with it. Wish I can find more items like this.</li>
