      <li>I couldnt love this more</li>
      <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I was very excited to try it.  </li>
      <li>Just a nice soft pleasant aroma of Gardenia.</li>
      <li>The sweet note was a nice touch.</li>
      <li>yes its strong but still lovely.</li>
      <li>I keep mine in the fridge sooo nice on hot days!</li>
      <li>Fortunately I still bought this one for a try :)</li>
      <li>I just want to say that I really appreciate that AND loved the product as well.</li>
      <li>The scent is very strong, almost overly sweet when you first spray it, but it dissipates nicely and lingers all day.</li>
      <li>Too strong fragrances, give me a headache, but not this one.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like it at all Strong wired smael</li>
      <li>love the personalized note full of Aloha spirit that I received from the vendor.</li>
      <li>Nothing comes close to the old &amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34; but this pleasant scent lingers.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend thinks it is too strong, but I enjoy wearing it just for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it reminds me of her,  which I enjoy.  </li>
      <li>This has the true smell of fresh gardenias, I love this product and the people who sold it</li>
      <li>Enjoying the perfume so much.  </li>
      <li>but my carry-on bag was full.</li>
      <li>The aroma was much better than most I have tried and will differently order again.</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite perfume, however it smells better than the gardenia cologne I purchased at the same time with this.</li>
      <li>This is the most realistic smelling gardenia perfume out there.  </li>
      <li>Lovely, realistic scent.  </li>
      <li>Lovely item that I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Oh my goodness it is exactly the smell of Gardenia!</li>
      <li>Worth every cent</li>
      <li>This was my mother&#x27;s favorite when she was alive,  so</li>
      <li>nice fragrance, not as lasting as i would like.  </li>
      <li>So many merchants take for granted the simple gestures that make the customer feel special.</li>
      <li>The initial smell is very strong when you just put it on.  </li>
      <li>Could smell a little bit more of gardenia, but it is still lovely.</li>
      <li>If you like the smell of fresh gardenias, this perfume smells EXACTLY like the real flower!</li>
      <li>For a pure floral it lasts a good 6 hours on the skin which is about the maximum that can be expected from a pure floral.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a real, not artificial, gardenia scent for years.</li>
      <li>I was also unimpressed when I first removed the cap and smelled it.</li>
      <li>I even bought another bottle 1 week after getting my first one.</li>
      <li>so it is most likely me and not the scent.</li>
      <li>Thanks to everyone who takes the time to write reviews; I hope mine was helpful!</li>
      <li>It is fantastic, and it is the closest to a natural scent I have ever smelled in any perfume.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>Very nice and long lasting.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the size (pretty much like a tube of lipstick), which is my fault for not reading the specs closer, and I was expecting a spray instead of a rollerball applicator.</li>
      <li>Not as strong as my last order</li>
      <li>which is fast.</li>
      <li>I really like the bottle with the roller applicator.</li>
      <li>smells nothing like the real stuff.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast &amp; order was executed efficiently.  </li>
      <li>After deciding to TRY it before trashing it publicly, I really feel like a fool.</li>
      <li>It is far closer than perfumes that cost more than ten times the price.  </li>
      <li>the site when order posts a wrong date, but it arrived quickly  and in pretty good condition.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I will use less perfume while rolling it on than by spraying it on.</li>
      <li>Oil scent lasts for a long time and is easy to apply (roll on).</li>
      <li>While it is only 1/4 of an ounce, I know it will last me a good long time.</li>
      <li>Wish it was a little more thicker...</li>
      <li>This is one of the few cases where you don&#x27;t get what you pay for, you do get a lot more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When I want to go on a vacation, I use this perfume and my spirit soars. It is lovely and the price was  excellent. It arrived in perfect condition. Lovely item that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness it is exactly the smell of Gardenia! And it&#x27;s really strong! After I purchased Jovan Island&#x27;s Gardenia perfume I was really disappointed and kinda lost hope for this one too. Fortunately I still bought this one for a try :) Although I wish the bottle could be the same as in the photo. The one I got has nothing printed on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love gardenia but this fades in seconds. Scent is gardenia. Justa waste of money.</li>
    <li> Nothing comes close to the old &amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34; but this pleasant scent lingers.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and I love the roller ball. Also the person who shipped it from Hawaii did a wonderful job making sure that the item would not break during shipment. The scent does not last very long, but no scent really lasts that long on me...so it is most likely me and not the scent.</li>
    <li> this is a perfect Gardenia scent!!</li>
    <li> Anything made in Hawaii is great</li>
    <li> love it. was looking fro this fragrance since i had jungle gardenia as a child</li>
    <li> I wish I could post a scent review along with a photo review! If you like the smell of fresh gardenias, this perfume smells EXACTLY like the real flower! I&#x27;ve been looking for a real, not artificial, gardenia scent for years. It is strong - you only need a tiny dab. My boyfriend thinks it is too strong, but I enjoy wearing it just for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my photos for how the bottle looks and for a size comparison. The bottle is not decorated or labeled; just a simple glass bottle. I ordered two - one for the house and one for my purse cosmetic kit. Sometimes while flying or anywhere I need a refreshing scent, I just sniff the bottle for a pick-me-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I&#x27;ve relied on reviews for years, but am only just now starting to write them myself. Thanks to everyone who takes the time to write reviews; I hope mine was helpful!**</li>
    <li> If you love gardenia scents, this is a must!</li>
    <li> Very nice and long lasting.  This was my mother&#x27;s favorite when she was alive,  so it reminds me of her,  which I enjoy.  Delightful.</li>
    <li> Not only does this perfume smell heavenly, the customer service is beyond excellent. I received a beautifully handwritten thank you note in the package which adds another element to the experience. So many merchants take for granted the simple gestures that make the customer feel special. I just want to say that I really appreciate that AND loved the product as well.</li>
    <li> I adore Gardenia so I was very excited to try it.  The initial smell is very strong when you just put it on.  After about half an hour the initial notes wear off, it smells some kind of chemical on my skin... Perfume works differently on everyone, guess this one didn&#x27;t gel with my body chemistry :-((&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the customer service and she was extremely helpful!</li>
    <li> The Gardenia scent is wonderful.  Shipping was fast &amp; order was executed efficiently.  Enjoying the perfume so much.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> This is the most realistic smelling gardenia perfume out there.  I have actually compared it next to a fresh, gardenia blossom and it is nearly identical.  It is far closer than perfumes that cost more than ten times the price.  For a pure floral it lasts a good 6 hours on the skin which is about the maximum that can be expected from a pure floral.  This is one of the few cases where you don&#x27;t get what you pay for, you do get a lot more.</li>
    <li> Smells so beautiful and I love that it&#x27;s a roll on!  This is my second purchase of the same scent.</li>
    <li> Delicious smell. Wish it was a little more thicker...too watery but awesome smell. Just like the flower</li>
    <li> Lovely, realistic scent.  Sometimes the sent can be over whelming but this was delicate, lovely and spot on.  The sweet note was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Love it stays on all day yes its strong but still lovely.Will buy again</li>
    <li> nice fragrance, not as lasting as i would like.  the site when order posts a wrong date, but it arrived quickly  and in pretty good condition.  a small dent in box, no damage to item.  would purchase again.</li>
    <li> There wonderful to work with</li>
    <li> This is the best garden is perfume that I have ever tried.  Do not hesitate to purchase.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as my last order</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite perfume, however it smells better than the gardenia cologne I purchased at the same time with this. Since I believe that perfume is a personal experience for everyone who enjoys,  likes and loves it, I can&#x27;t really find anything wrong with this. It&#x27;s just not for me, so I&#x27;ll be giving them as gifts.</li>
    <li> The Gardinia perfume made in Hawaii can in as promised and was package very safe. The aroma was much better than most I have tried and will differently order again. Love it thank you.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the flower!</li>
    <li> I couldnt love this more</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all Strong wired smael</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It smells just like the flower. I have had so many compliments on it. I even bought another bottle 1 week after getting my first one. Will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> smells nothing like the real stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok-not great. Good news is it&#x27;s cheap--bad news is it smells cheap! Not sure why it came with the perfume outside the box-made me think it was some fake they sent</li>
    <li> Oil scent lasts for a long time and is easy to apply (roll on). Came in earlier than expected. Very pleased:)</li>
    <li> I stopped by a  souvenir shop on my last morning in Hawaii and would have purchased this perfume then but my carry-on bag was full. I regretted it immediately. I was so happy to find this perfume available on Amazon. The scent is very strong, almost overly sweet when you first spray it, but it dissipates nicely and lingers all day. It is fantastic, and it is the closest to a natural scent I have ever smelled in any perfume. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the personalized note full of Aloha spirit that I received from the vendor. Excellent all around.</li>
    <li> Best gardenia fragrance ever !! I bought several of these and I get compliments all the time. And it ships from Hawaii so you are getting a quality product. Shipping sometimes is pricey but I&#x27;m hooked on the fragrance, just like a flower garden but not overpowering!</li>
    <li> If you want the Islands delivered to your door, purchase this product.  Only wish the scent lasted longer.  Mahalo.</li>
    <li> Great gardenia perfume and I am going to be ordering more for the holidays. I really like the bottle with the roller applicator. I keep mine in the fridge sooo nice on hot days!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Kai oil roll-on and the body lotion. Loved the scent but not the price, and the fragrance would fade with-in 30 minutes and was gone....no kidding. What a waste of money.  So I took a chance and decided to try this perfume. The price was great and fit nicely into my budget. Wish I now would of spent my money here on these products instead of elsewhere. The Gardenia perfume is FABULOUS!!! It&#x27;s been 4 hour&#x27;s, since I put it on and I can&#x27;t tell you how \\&quot;happy\\&quot; this perfume.....makes me feel. I can still smell it and it hasn&#x27;t faded a bit. Not overpowering at all. Just a nice soft pleasant aroma of Gardenia. Too strong fragrances, give me a headache, but not this one. It&#x27;s lovely!!! I have never been to Hawaii and probably never will, but my mother had Gardenia&#x27;s in our back yard when I was a child and this perfume takes me back there. Worth every cent......I will always buy this with no hesitation and have already ordered the Plumeria spray cologne, from the same company and waiting for it&#x27;s arrival...which is fast. I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed. Cindy</li>
    <li> its nice and strong, it could be a bit cheaper though</li>
    <li> The smell is just like gardenia. I only hope it will last a longer time.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not going to lie; when this perfume first arrived I was disappointed. I couldn&#x27;t believe the size (pretty much like a tube of lipstick), which is my fault for not reading the specs closer, and I was expecting a spray instead of a rollerball applicator. I was also unimpressed when I first removed the cap and smelled it. I was actually mentally wording the negative review I intended to post. God, what an idiot I was. After deciding to TRY it before trashing it publicly, I really feel like a fool. It was only after rolling the perfume over pulse points, and wetting the rollerball with the perfume (duh!) was I able to truly smell it. &amp;#34;Wow,&amp;#34; is all I can say! It is fabulous! I applied it a few hours ago and the scent is still fresh. While it is only 1/4 of an ounce, I know it will last me a good long time. I&#x27;m pretty sure I will use less perfume while rolling it on than by spraying it on. Consider me one very, VERY satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a lovely floral.  Could smell a little bit more of gardenia, but it is still lovely.</li>
    <li> This has the true smell of fresh gardenias, I love this product and the people who sold it are very nice to work with.</li>
    <li> Wonderful company and product.</li>
