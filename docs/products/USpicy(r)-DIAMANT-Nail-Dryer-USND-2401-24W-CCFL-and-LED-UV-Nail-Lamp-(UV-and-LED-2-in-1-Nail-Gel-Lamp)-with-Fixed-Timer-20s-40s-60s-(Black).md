      <li>Lamp arrived fast and securely packaged.</li>
      <li>I really like this light</li>

      <li>Overall very pleased with this lamp; I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I have had a UV lamp for almost 2 year, didn&#x27;t pay very much</li>

      <li>the bottom is magnetic,  I think...  and doesn&#x27;t connect very well,</li>

      <li>Fast shipping</li>

      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>I really likk my new lamp.</li>
      <li>A 30s-1 min-3 min setup would be much more convenient than the current 20s-40s-60s setup it currently has.</li>
      <li>I bought the older version of this dryer.</li>
      <li>The UV/LED combo allows for a significantly shorter curing time than traditional UV lamps, which saves time and money in the professional environment.</li>

      <li>my old lamp.</li>
      <li>The unit is small and compact but still large enough to fit the entire hand.</li>
      <li>I feel like after constant use on clients in the professional setting, the lamp or bulbs or a combination of both are worn out and have caused a lapse in the quality of my services.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used 2 different brands of gel polish (Sensationail &amp; CND shellac) and didn&#x27;t have any problems curing either one.</li>
      <li>My one and only issue is the power cord that plugs into the outlet: it is large so if plugging directly into a wall socket, stick it in the lower port, otherwise it&#x27;ll block the other outlet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome little lamp. I have been using it for months for personal/home use and it&#x27;s been working great since day 1.</li>
    <li> This product dries my Shellac nail polish well.  The only problem I had was the directions that came with the dryer that were poorly written, making it a little difficult to figure out what exactly the directions were saying.</li>
    <li> thank you the box arrived quickly it works well , i was disappointed , when i removed the shrink wrap cover from the white hard plastic box, the front had scratches on it and some black scratch marks on the front</li>
    <li> This UV lamp is great so far. Just received it yesterday. You have to put in the lights but it is very easy to do so. Not damaged, packaged very nice. Instructions and warnings are in English, which is helpful. Have not used it yet, but all the UV lights turned on bright. There is also a timer so you do not have to look at a clock or set a separate timer yourself.</li>
    <li> I really like this light and it&#x27;s nice to have the different timers.</li>
    <li> I have had a UV lamp for almost 2 year, didn&#x27;t pay very much and it served it&#x27;s purpose but I wanted a time saver. So I opted for this lamp. It would have been perfect as I have different gel polishes that may not have worked with the led aspect.  I bought it used it 2 times and the third time the uV light wouldn&#x27;t work. My heart broke because the only way it would stay on was if I held the button down... So I figured it may have been defective. So I returned it and purchased another. Then, used it once and the timers were not accurate, neither setting would stay on for more than 5 seconds.... So very disappointed for an avid gel polish user. On to the next...</li>
    <li> I really likk my new lamp. It gets the job done way quicker then my old lamp. I can be done with my nails in 20 minutes top.</li>
    <li> The size item wasn&#x27;t correct: to small compare with the one posted on the list. I&#x27;m still keep that lamp to use at home, when I tried for myself it&#x27;s fine! So far so good. A little upset about wrong size item.&lt;br /&gt;I hope things posted all correct for future!!</li>
    <li> **UPDATED REVIEW** So, update on my purchase, roughly 8 months later. I cannot say anymore that I recommend professional nail techs purchase this lamp. I feel like after constant use on clients in the professional setting, the lamp or bulbs or a combination of both are worn out and have caused a lapse in the quality of my services. I have gone back to sharing one Gelish brand lamp between 4 nail techs, groan. I would prefer to buy this lamp for my own use, however it is very expensive. For home and personal use, however, the USpicy lamp would be suitable.  _________________________________________ Previous review:  This is a GREAT little lamp. I am a nail technician with over 5 years of experience and this lamp definitely does the trick. It works well with Gelish, Perfect Match, Shellac brands without a problem. I was also able to do Rockstar and foils without issue. The UV/LED combo allows for a significantly shorter curing time than traditional UV lamps, which saves time and money in the professional environment. The unit is small and compact but still large enough to fit the entire hand. Unless the client has spindly fingers, you won&#x27;t really be able to stack the hands atop one another, however. My one and only issue is the power cord that plugs into the outlet: it is large so if plugging directly into a wall socket, stick it in the lower port, otherwise it&#x27;ll block the other outlet. If plugging into a surge protector, it will block multiple other ports if not plugged into the last port at the end.  Overall very pleased with this lamp; I highly recommend it.  Side note, as a professional, I highly recommend the use of CND&#x27;s Scrub Fresh as a nail prep solution prior to applying the gel base coat.</li>
    <li> I bought the older version of this dryer. It was super cheap! It has work great though! I have used it at least once a week for the last 3 years with no issues at all!</li>
    <li> I used this lamp for Gelish polish and it worked great, I used the 2 minute timer for each step and the last coat (top it off top coat) I cured for 3 minutes (maybe overkill but it worked!)</li>
    <li> Works great. Cures nails fast.</li>
    <li> Great light.  Love the timer feature and that you are able to insert whole hand, or foot.  Gave a s a gift and they were thrilled with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve put polish on my nails and I&#x27;ve only ever been to the nail salon once, for my wedding.  For a nail novice like me, I had no problems using this USpicy UV Gel Lamp Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ASSEMBLY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assembly involved placing the lightbulbs into the proper slots.  That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPERATION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions were poorly translated to English, but it&#x27;s intuitive and not really necessary.  There are two timer settings (2 minutes and 3 minutes), an always on mode, and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the timer settings.  It means I don&#x27;t ever have to look at a clock.  Just put my hands in and wait for the light to turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLYING GEL NAILS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This UV lamp is for curing gel nail products.  Before you use it, you&#x27;ll need to buy some supplies.  I bought the [[ASIN:B0057JCYYE Gelish Basix Kit]] (which comes with everything but the polish) and Gelish nail polish.  If you are worried about the effect of UV light, there are also [[ASIN:B006L6WNVG anti-UV gloves]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t watch any You Tube videos nor read up much on instructions, but here&#x27;s what I did and it gave my nails a nice finish:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Shape and buff the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply the pH bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply the foundation.  Set in UV dryer for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Apply the polish, then set in UV dryer for 2 minutes.  Repeat twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Apply top coat, then set in UV dryer for 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Wipe nails with cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) Apply cuticle oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was surprisingly easy to do, considering the number of websites devoted to teaching the process.  The only thing I need to improve upon is applying an even layer of nail polish with my right hand.  I&#x27;m not very good with my right hand, but I suspect most women have had enough practice doing this that it would not be a problem with either hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOME OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is larger than I expected, but that means I can dry all the fingers of one hand or all the toes on one foot at once.  It does get warm in there, but not uncomfortably hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This UV gel nail dryer works exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  If someone like me can get the results I did, anyone can do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Sunvalleytek.l the fingers of one hand or all the toes on one foot at once.

    <li> This is a perfect little lamp! It has a timer and I have used it with both UV and LED gel and has fine what it is supposed to and cured both perfectly. If you ever get messy and get nail polish on the silver bottom (I don&#x27;t know how you could do that...?) or need to change the light the bottom of this light is magnetically attached to th the light portion so you don&#x27;t have to go grab tools to dismember it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item, but remember everything is not perfect (online or in stores) so just know you never know when your getting a dud!</li>
    <li> Good machine.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying at the salon to have done what I can do myself.  This works just as good as if I went somewhere to have gel put on my nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a manicurist . I thought this unit will use LED and UV to cure gel polish as it described. DO not buy this cheap product from china.&lt;br /&gt;i want to return it but it is not returnable. That should tell that they don&#x27;t want it back in any case!!!&lt;br /&gt;The UV light is worthless. And the led is NOt strong enough to cure the gel.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Just check the thumbs to make sure they are drying OK</li>
    <li> Love my LED nail lamp. I have only done 2 gel manicures, but they have both turned out quite nice. So far, I&#x27;ve used 2 different brands of gel polish (Sensationail &amp; CND shellac) and didn&#x27;t have any problems curing either one. Lamp arrived fast and securely packaged. Would do business with this seller again.</li>
    <li> Works excellently for both gel nails and gel polishes. Great value for the price, especially for us nail DIYers. Only one minor complaint, and it&#x27;s more of a small annoyance than anything, is the timer. A 30s-1 min-3 min setup would be much more convenient than the current 20s-40s-60s setup it currently has. But for the price, I really can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
    <li> Lamp had broken, it returned the goods.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry like salon dryers</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute little travel size light. I really like it, it gets the job done and looks very  professional.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and so does my family.  The only downside is (and maybe it&#x27;s just the lamp that was delivered to me ) the bottom is magnetic,  I think...  and doesn&#x27;t connect very well, so every time I use it I have to adjust the bottom to the body of the lamp.  Maybe I&#x27;m just blonde... regardless I love my little lamp, some day will upgrade to a bigger one.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well although the lights keep turning off. I&#x27;m afraid that it may break down because of this. I&#x27;ve just used it three times.</li>
