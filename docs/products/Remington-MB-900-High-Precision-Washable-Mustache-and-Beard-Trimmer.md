      <li>Comes with a pair of scissors and a barbers comb, which are without a doubt the best things in the box on terms of hair grooming.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i especially liked the charging stand.</li>

      <li>Nice looking trimmer.</li>
      <li>Love the caddy</li>
      <li>Wahl seems to be a better option.</li>
      <li>I bought it immediately and plan on ordering a couple more for Christmas presents.</li>
      <li>I have however tried it as a beard trimmer and wasn&#x27;t all that pleased so for that...</li>
      <li>for me it is a great tool and works very well.</li>
      <li>and I used it mostly to give myself a stubble shave and sometimes fix my barber&#x27;s mistakes.</li>
      <li>I bought a spare, because overall this is the best trimmer I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I bought them for personal grooming purposes and I must say that I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>

      <li>Got this trimmer as a gift for New Year and was quite happy.</li>
      <li>These are the first higher-end trimmers that I have invested in and I am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>Happy so far with product and supplier,</li>
      <li>One year, all parts are good as new, battery won&#x27;t charge any more</li>
      <li>it comes with, easy to store and keep track of the accessories.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair as easily.  </li>
      <li>motor is strong and it trims well.</li>
      <li>Affordable, very solid construction, easy blade change, easy to wash, doesn&#x27;t come with a million extras you never use, great battery charge life, compact size, and cuts as close as these style of shavers do.</li>
      <li>Once it is there the trimmer works fine</li>
      <li>This trimmer looks great and it has a shiney outside.</li>
      <li>This is a great overall product.</li>
      <li>This trimmer was advertised as being able to run being plugged in or from the battery, but it did not run worth</li>
      <li>So you it won&#x27;t sound like you got a lawn mower in the bathroom.</li>
      <li>just got it over the holidays, and it is far superior to my Wahl razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
      <li>These things are well worth the not-so-high price!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first</li>
      <li>You might get lucky and the adapters will fit on yours</li>
      <li>This is a multi pass trimmer at best, the comb attachments don&#x27;t even properly line up with the blades, they are so far away from the comb</li>
      <li>Capable of extremely close trimming which is excellent for prepping for a followup shave.</li>
      <li>This sets the batteries memory as to what a full charge should be.  </li>
      <li>:)  From this point forward, do the following:  -Disconnect the charger from the wall, if you have a full charge and not planning to use it for more than 3 days at a time  </li>
      <li>Even now, blades look like new and shiny after 2yrs of use. :)</li>
      <li>They stay sharp, charge quickly, and can run continuously for a good while.  </li>
      <li>2nd one will last for 3 years and is a sold good value for the money, will buy again in 3 years time :)</li>
      <li>That fact alone makes it worth while.  </li>
      <li>First off, this seems to be a great product if you are looking for a beard shaper, but I am a little dissappointed with the trim ability.</li>
      <li>You need to sort of message it in to just the right spot.  </li>
      <li>I loved my first one the second one I&#x27;m less thrilled about.</li>
      <li>its your first time using it, let it charge the 10-16hrs it requires first.  </li>
      <li>I had Philips trimmer before and this Remington is much better in everything - from blades to overall feeling.    </li>
      <li>This is my second unit as I bought one of this model when it first came out many years ago</li>
      <li>i returned it after first use and got an andis trimmer.</li>
      <li>I was pleased by the way the trimmer itself was smaller than my Norelco and seemed well made.</li>
      <li>It worked immediately and was running better now than it had when I was charging the dying batteries recently.  </li>
      <li>It is rare when I find a product good enough to repeat the old model instead of buying the new version or another brand.</li>
      <li>I am stuck with this since the money back offer is only good for 30 days.</li>
      <li>Back to Norelco,they have a solid product that is well designed top to bottom,be careful and choose wisely.</li>
      <li>I like the case and additional heads for it a real DANDY...</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon you came throught Once again....</li>
      <li>Now that&#x27;s a real beard trimmer.</li>
      <li>It has a strong metal housing unlike the cheap plastic one&#x27;s I have bought in the past.</li>
      <li>-Don&#x27;t wash with water directly, clean with a damp cloth, or remove the blades alone and wash those under running water only.</li>
      <li>It arrived on time and was exactly as I expected as I had one just like it that would have cost me more to have repaired then to buy this NEW one...</li>
      <li>The trimmer now works about 3 to 5 minutes after full charge, so the only way to use it is to plug it in.</li>
      <li>The final clincher for me with hating this beard trimmer was that while most other beard trimmers make reference to using ni-cad batteries on the packaging, this trimmer had no such reference, so I had hopes it used a better battery.  </li>
      <li>but I really do like the new  trimmer.</li>
      <li>The Remington is more quiet, pulls less, and performs better when keeping my beard very short or at \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; length.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s necessary to go over and over and over the same area so many times</li>
      <li>you can use the larger heads elsewhere and its quick and painless.</li>
      <li>(I was fortunate I had the same battery type in an old closet set to throw stuff out).</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for precision grooming.</li>
      <li>Highly recomended.</li>
      <li>It really ticks me off that manufacturers insist on using short lived ni-cad batteries when putting in a good nickel metal hydride battery would only increase the cost of the product a few dollars and would double or triple the useful life of the product.  </li>
      <li>Now, it works like new.  </li>
      <li>so I bought a new one.  </li>
      <li>look and finish, and the washable / waterproof element is a great feature as commonly shavers can and do get wet while sitting on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just make sure you use the small head for that</li>
      <li>At first it seems like these settings would be enough</li>
      <li>So forget about any nice, short and sharp facial hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t experiment with other types of batteries, I was lucky I had the exact same rating and types of batteries to replace it with.</li>
      <li>I got this trimmer to replace my old Norelco.</li>
      <li>Also the smallest trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old one.  </li>
      <li>and it seems like the attatchments go from stubble to pretty long.</li>
      <li>It seems that the moving blade is set back further than the first one I had</li>
      <li>I like my gotee pretty short, just above the stubble stage</li>
      <li>I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer and have had the exact opposite experience.</li>
      <li>It is solid,and hefty unlike others that I have used in the past which felt cheap in the hand, constructed of plastic.  </li>
      <li>Not much to say except that it did the job as advertised: powerful, quiet, neat job on trimming sideburns and over the ears.</li>
      <li>well thought out and so far terrific product.</li>
      <li>This is a low cost trimmer I bought for my 20 year old son.</li>
      <li>:)  After using it for 2yrs, the charge starting to hold less and less, from 15mins, to 12 and after not using it for 4 months (leaving it off the charger, but not fully charged before doing so)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The clips I attach either cut my beard too close or not quite enough...  so that&#x27;s my only complaint..  Nice looking trimmer.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money, a horrible investment. Spend the extra money and buy the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer. Now that&#x27;s a real beard trimmer. The Remington has no power, short battery life, does not have sharp blades making you go over the same part over and over, and cuts one length only...stubble. It is useless. I used it 10 times and was disgusted. I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer and have had the exact opposite experience.</li>
    <li> Not able to trim mustache close. You would have to have a bushy, thick mustache to work.  Not satified at all.</li>
    <li> This is a low cost trimmer I bought for my 20 year old son. They all work the same, the only difference is how it&#x27;s made. It has a strong metal housing unlike the cheap plastic one&#x27;s I have bought in the past. Highly recomended.</li>
    <li> its alright. it cuts... but not close. and it tends to pull at hairs. i returned it after first use and got an andis trimmer. i was kind of upset, i expected a lot from this.</li>
    <li> Was extremely happy with my purchase and the delivery was quicker than stated.  Bravo, for a wonderful site and excellent Service.    Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is a 5 star bady groomer in my opinion, especially for those sensetive areas.... just make sure you use the small head for that or you will get pinched. you can use the larger heads elsewhere and its quick and painless. Since this is the purpose in which I bought it for, I think its great!     I have however tried it as a beard trimmer and wasn&#x27;t all that pleased so for that... 1 star</li>
    <li> I had one of these for three years or so.  I worked great for me.  Eventually the battery stopped holding a charge so I bought a new one.  The new one&#x27;s power switch is very difficult.  You can&#x27;t just put in all the way in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position.  You need to sort of message it in to just the right spot.  Once it is there the trimmer works fine but, it is still kinda a pain.  Also the smallest trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old one.  It seems that the moving blade is set back further than the first one I had and it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair as easily.  I find it is more difficult to use for precision trimming.  The best part about this is I take it in the shower.  That fact alone makes it worth while.  I loved my first one the second one I&#x27;m less thrilled about.</li>
    <li> This trimmer looks great and it has a shiney outside. The clippers work great but there aren&#x27;t enough settings for the desired styles that I want to shape. I like to fade my beard so that the stubble starts at the tip of my side burns and I blend the hair down gradually getting thicker as I go toward my chin. What sucks is that the four settings on this thing don&#x27;t allow me this option. 3mm, 6mm, 9mm, 12mm. At first it seems like these settings would be enough but I found that I would like something in between 3 and 6, and in between 6 and 9.</li>
    <li> I ordered this when my husband&#x27;s trimmer quit working.  I thought it would get here in plenty of time. It did but it was a defective product.  It took over a month for the company to remedy the problem!  I will never buy from them again.</li>
    <li> 2nd one will last for 3 years and is a sold good value for the money, will buy again in 3 years time :)</li>
    <li> Affordable, very solid construction, easy blade change, easy to wash, doesn&#x27;t come with a million extras you never use, great battery charge life, compact size, and cuts as close as these style of shavers do.</li>
    <li> de verdad la maquina es excelente y esta a muy buen precion pero uno no compensa lo otro porque la bajaron de precio y aumentaron el envio que es casi igual al precio de la maquina.</li>
    <li> One year, all parts are good as new, battery won&#x27;t charge any more so I&#x27;m shopping for another. I&#x27;d have been happy to buy a replacement battery but couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old trimmer due to it&#x27;s sheer age. I had hoped to at least get something equal. This is a multi pass trimmer at best, the comb attachments don&#x27;t even properly line up with the blades, they are so far away from the comb it&#x27;s necessary to go over and over and over the same area so many times and it still misses some. It looks nice, rechargeable is a nice feature. If only it worked as well as it looks.</li>
    <li> Precision cut at an affordable price.  The battery lasts a long time without having to recharge  and the trimmers function perfectly.  Highly recommend for precision grooming.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this beard trimmer, but was disappointed immediately upon opening the box. feeling the teeth of the trimmer with my fingers I found them to be sharp and too thin.  Upon trying to use the trimmer to edge my beard I found, as I had feared, that the sharp teeth pulled and scratched my skin. It also had a habit of pulling hairs. While using it with the trimmer guards, I found that holding it at some angles caused the trimmer to trim closer than expected leaving me with a short patch on my chin that had to be evened out.      This trimmer was advertised as being able to run being plugged in or from the battery, but it did not run worth a darn plugged in.     The final clincher for me with hating this beard trimmer was that while most other beard trimmers make reference to using ni-cad batteries on the packaging, this trimmer had no such reference, so I had hopes it used a better battery.  I was greatly disappointed when I found buried in the included manual that the trimmer had a ni-cad battery.  This means that if I were to have kept the trimmer it would have been useless after a year or two.    It really ticks me off that manufacturers insist on using short lived ni-cad batteries when putting in a good nickel metal hydride battery would only increase the cost of the product a few dollars and would double or triple the useful life of the product.  This built in obsolescence of products creates a horrible environmental waste, not to mention wastes consumer&#x27;s hard earned money.    I returned my trimmer to the store from which I bought it a few days after buying it.  I almost never return products, but I was not about to keep this trimmer.    Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in a timely manner and when I got it I loved it. I bought it for my boyfriend and he was so happy and loves this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy... just got it over the holidays, and it is far superior to my Wahl razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great look and finish, and the washable / waterproof element is a great feature as commonly shavers can and do get wet while sitting on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i especially liked the charging stand. well thought out and so far terrific product.</li>
    <li> I got this trimmer to replace my old Norelco.I was pleased by the way the trimmer itself was smaller than my Norelco and seemed well made.That idea came to a screeching halt once I had it charged and started to use it.The adapters to set the trim depth are poorly made and set crooked on the trimmer and come off even when not in use.I thought maybe it would improve as I got used to using it,not a chance.I have tried for a couple months to get accustomed to it and it is just poorly designed and not well thought out.I am stuck with this since the money back offer is only good for 30 days.You might get lucky and the adapters will fit on yours but it is taking a chance.Back to Norelco,they have a solid product that is well designed top to bottom,be careful and choose wisely.</li>
    <li> First off, this seems to be a great product if you are looking for a beard shaper, but I am a little dissappointed with the trim ability. Non of the attachments are very short. I like my gotee pretty short, just above the stubble stage and it seems like the attatchments go from stubble to pretty long. Maybe I have not messed around with it enough to know all the secrets but so far only very little or a lot of hair on the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is strong and it trims well. Also like the cord/cordless feature. It is a sturdy model.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and was exactly as I expected as I had one just like it that would have cost me more to have repaired then to buy this NEW one...I like the case and additional heads for it a real DANDY...Thanks Amazon you came throught Once again.... Walleye....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read all the good and bad reviews here and obviously it will depend on your beard as some people seem to not like this clippers but for me it is a great tool and works very well. This is my second unit as I bought one of this model when it first came out many years ago and it still works but I just decided to replace it with a shiny one. It is rare when I find a product good enough to repeat the old model instead of buying the new version or another brand. The company sent me a DOA unit but they replaced it in short order.</li>
    <li> Battery noticeably starts losing the ability to hold its charge after 4 months.  Wahl seems to be a better option.</li>
    <li> One can feel the quality while holding this trimmer.  It is solid,and hefty unlike others that I have used in the past which felt cheap in the hand, constructed of plastic.  I bought one just like it a couple of years ago for 35 dollars.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the deal when I found it on Amazon.  I bought it immediately and plan on ordering a couple more for Christmas presents.</li>
    <li> This glorious product:&lt;br /&gt;1. Painfully pulls at hairs, with almost every stroke!&lt;br /&gt;2. Comes with two clip-on double-sided attachment combs, which are supposed to enable four different trimming lengths, but they all leave the hair too long. So forget about any nice, short and sharp facial hairstyles.&lt;br /&gt;3. Comes with three detachable trimmer blades (each one having a different width), but they all trim identically \\&quot;well\\&quot; (see point #1 above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus points:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s relatively quiet. So you it won&#x27;t sound like you got a lawn mower in the bathroom. (However you might end up cursing and yelling in there by yourself...see point #1 above).&lt;br /&gt;2. Comes with a pair of scissors and a barbers comb, which are without a doubt the best things in the box on terms of hair grooming.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s a great paper weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Skip this product.</li>
    <li> this is my second one that I buy my daughter broke my 1st one I recommend this shaver,  its Like cuttin with a barber...</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, its been more than two years since I order it and it works as good as day one.</li>
    <li> This is a great overall product. I got it as a gift and I used it mostly to give myself a stubble shave and sometimes fix my barber&#x27;s mistakes. :)  After using it for 2yrs, the charge starting to hold less and less, from 15mins, to 12 and after not using it for 4 months (leaving it off the charger, but not fully charged before doing so) it never held a charge beyond 3-4mins now and running slow.  I did a \\&quot;Mac Guyver\\&quot; on the battery replacement I had (I was fortunate I had the same battery type in an old closet set to throw stuff out). I then reassembled everything and left it charging for 5 minutes to test. It worked immediately and was running better now than it had when I was charging the dying batteries recently.  Now, it works like new.  If you plan to change the batteries yourself, order the actual batteries. Don&#x27;t experiment with other types of batteries, I was lucky I had the exact same rating and types of batteries to replace it with. :)  From this point forward, do the following:  -Disconnect the charger from the wall, if you have a full charge and not planning to use it for more than 3 days at a time  -If its your first time using it, let it charge the 10-16hrs it requires first.  This sets the batteries memory as to what a full charge should be.  -Don&#x27;t wash with water directly, clean with a damp cloth, or remove the blades alone and wash those under running water only. The handle (where you hold the body of the trimmer) is not waterproof.  3 stars, because I didn&#x27;t follow these rules, nor were they stated on the instructional care manual it came with.  Even now, blades look like new and shiny after 2yrs of use. :)</li>
    <li> These are the first higher-end trimmers that I have invested in and I am very pleased.  I bought them for personal grooming purposes and I must say that I&#x27;m impressed.  They stay sharp, charge quickly, and can run continuously for a good while.  I can knock out the whole shabangabang in out charge, if you know what I mean.  Also, I&#x27;m a big fan of the charging base and the extra blade attachments that were included.  These things are well worth the not-so-high price!</li>
    <li> Got this trimmer as a gift for New Year and was quite happy. I had Philips trimmer before and this Remington is much better in everything - from blades to overall feeling.    But after couple of weeks of use, battery died. The trimmer now works about 3 to 5 minutes after full charge, so the only way to use it is to plug it in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 of these over time, and although they looked identical, one of the units had absolutely superior trimming performance.  The AC adapted died on one, and another had a blade break off the head.  I bought a spare, because overall this is the best trimmer I have ever used.  Capable of extremely close trimming which is excellent for prepping for a followup shave.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first but I really do like the new  trimmer. It has met or exceeded my expectations.  The price was lower than I thought it would be also.  Love the caddy it comes with, easy to store and keep track of the accessories. Recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself to replace my previous Norelco trimmer (the plastic attachment&#x27;s clip broke) and hated it.  The motor seems weak, a charge only lasted for a couple of days it seemed.  I used it once and went back to using my broken Norelco so I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> The title says it all.  I&#x27;ve tried Norelco, Wahl, and Panasonic.  The Remington is more quiet, pulls less, and performs better when keeping my beard very short or at \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; length.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, packaged well.  Not much to say except that it did the job as advertised: powerful, quiet, neat job on trimming sideburns and over the ears. I like the charging ability to plug the charging cord in through the stand or into the trimmer or it can be used as a corded or cordless trimmer. Happy so far with product and supplier,</li>
    <li> This is my fav Beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> Worked great for about 6-months, then no longer held a charge.  Still works when it&#x27;s plugged into the cord, but obviously not as useful since you&#x27;re tethered to a cord and can&#x27;t use it in the shower, etc...  Attachments work well- stay put when they&#x27;re attached, and doesn&#x27;t need to get oiled often. In 6-months I&#x27;ve only had it get &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; on my goatee once.</li>
