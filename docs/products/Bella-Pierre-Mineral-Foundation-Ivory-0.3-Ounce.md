      <li>Overall, I am VERY happy with the product.</li>

      <li>I am glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to remove since it&#x27;s so light.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because it was advertised as non-comedogenic and good very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I am lightly tanned but forgot that my face and neck is way lighter than my body.</li>
      <li>and I liked it so much I went on line to find it.</li>
      <li>Fits my pale complexion perfectly.</li>
      <li>I bought this foundation originally from there.</li>
      <li>If it didn&#x27;t have this effect on my skin I would have liked it because it goes on smooth and natural.</li>
      <li>What do I got to lose right?!</li>
      <li>I do love korres wild rose mineral and it only has like 2 more ing.</li>
      <li>the go&amp;#34; and need something that is quick to apply and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>I found Bella Pierre and decided to give it a try as it is all natural and very light.</li>
      <li>It was totally worth buying.</li>
      <li>It has the right amount of coverage for me and never looks cakey.</li>
      <li>I had to turn right around and buy another brand.</li>
      <li>This product is better than bare minerals and cheaper.  </li>
      <li>I had first tried it from a kit I bought at TJ Maxx</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to Bella Pierre as I was walking through a mall</li>
      <li>It feels really light and natural on my skin.</li>
      <li>It was the exact color I needed</li>
      <li>this foundation powder is light, airy, not heavy like cream or liquid foundations, you don&#x27;t need much either.  </li>
      <li>Although I prefer Bare Minerals blush and their finishing powder called mineral veil, in my opinion Bella Pierre foundation is FAR superior to the foundation made by Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>I have red blotchy skin that is easily camouflaged by this product.</li>
      <li>The coverage looks very even, as well as in the sunlight.</li>
      <li>It is also much cheaper here on amazon than you can find it for retail sale, assuming you even can find it in stores.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper online.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I really like this makeup.  </li>
      <li>If you are prone to acne, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I found this product a little over a year ago and love it.  </li>
      <li>I might even end up purchasing a few more.</li>
      <li>and I was very surprised when I received it.</li>
      <li>Original makeup for half prize.</li>
      <li>People are often surprised to discover I am wearing make-up.</li>
      <li>It has not dried my skin</li>
      <li>I am prone to acne and was searching high and low for a powder foundation that would not cause me to breakout.</li>
      <li>In the past I have tried mineral based cosmetics such as the Bare Minerals brand, and had varying degrees of success with their products.</li>
      <li>First of all it works EXTREMELY well as a spot concealer, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes as easily as Bare Minerals and it lasts all day with minimal maintenance.</li>

    <li> Best foundation ever. I&#x27;ve only&lt;br /&gt;Ever bought this at the actual kiosks this company usually has in mall. I was happy when I found it here for so cheap. It can work as a loose powder or if you add a tiny bit of water to the amount your going to use that day it work as a liquid and stays all day.</li>
    <li> great for touch up during the day or when i forget to put my makeup on before i go to work.  i can put it on at work now :)</li>
    <li> This product is too orange.</li>
    <li> Bought this mineral foundation for me and I was very surprised when I received it. It was the exact color I needed and it was the big one. I thought it was going to be the small one. It was totally worth buying. I might even end up purchasing a few more.</li>
    <li> I recently threw away all my liquid foundations and pressed powders after learning that they contained chemicals that could age my skin. I found Bella Pierre and decided to give it a try as it is all natural and very light. I fell in love with it. It has the right amount of coverage for me and never looks cakey. I have red blotchy skin that is easily camouflaged by this product. The coverage looks very even, as well as in the sunlight. It also gives my skin just a touch of shimmer. It&#x27;s very easy to remove since it&#x27;s so light. I recommend</li>
    <li> Replacement for product purchased several years ago -- last forever!</li>
    <li> great product!! smooth not cakey and no pimples from this! Good Stuff! I re-ordered which says a lot for me.</li>
    <li> This product is better than bare minerals and cheaper.  It does have SPF and it goes a long way.  I have been using the same one for a year.</li>
    <li> Original makeup for half prize. The best mineral makeup it won&#x27;t make you break out. I recommend this foundation/concealer  for any type of skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup.  It is not like bare minerals (which is terrible).  I had first tried it from a kit I bought at TJ Maxx and I liked it so much I went on line to find it.</li>
    <li> Great Mineral Foundation at a great price, The Ivory color is very light but after I blended it with a darker shade, the color is perfect, will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I had never used mineral makeup before, so based on reviews thought I would try this.  Although I am very fair the &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; shade looks yellowy or orangey on me; poor coverage, very difficult to shake any product out of the sifter holes.  In fact, the sifter looks totally different from star shaped one in the picture on Amazon.  It does NOT give the effect of an almost 30 dollar make-up.  Does someone counterfeit these?  Anyway, I hate it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was advertised as non-comedogenic and good very sensitive skin.  Unfortunately this product still makes me break out terribly.  If it didn&#x27;t have this effect on my skin I would have liked it because it goes on smooth and natural.</li>
    <li> This reduced the amount of pimples I have.(That may have something to do with me using the Bella Pierre milky cleanser before applying the make up) It is very light and looks amazing. My skin glows when I use it. I have used a lot of different kinds of make up and this is by far the BEST!</li>
    <li> So I wanted this because its only like 4 ing. but it was flake city. I had to turn right around and buy another brand. And since we cant return on here im stuck with it. ITs soooo dry. Unwearable for me :( I do love korres wild rose mineral and it only has like 2 more ing. if you were looking for another one.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful light yet excellent coverage as a foundation!  It&#x27;s  like wearing no makeup it&#x27;s that comfortable!  This will be the only foundation I will buy from now on! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, I love the coverage and how light it feels on my face! I&#x27;ll never go back to liquid! I was so happy to find it here on amazon for such a great deal! I definitely give this product five stars!</li>
    <li> Love the product. No skin issues whatsoever. Fits my pale complexion perfectly.</li>
    <li> Nice light weight powder foundation. Much cheaper online.</li>
    <li> this foundation powder is light, airy, not heavy like cream or liquid foundations, you don&#x27;t need much either.  love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mineral foundation for 3-4 years and I haven&#x27;t looked back since. I have oily skin that tends to break out very easily. This product does not irritate my skin. It also gives me very good natural coverage (i.e. the &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; makeup look). People are often surprised to discover I am wearing make-up. I am glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Always happy with Bella Pierre cosmetics! I never use anything else. Great coverage, good for the skin also.</li>
    <li> I found this product a little over a year ago and love it.  I have stopped using all of the other products in my makeup bag.  The foundation has great coverage.  I am a mom &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; and need something that is quick to apply and lasts all day.  So happy to have found BellaPierre.</li>
    <li> This is just the perfect amount of coverage and is so easy to apply.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I am prone to acne and was searching high and low for a powder foundation that would not cause me to breakout. I read many good reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. What do I got to lose right?! Shipping was fast. I have honestly been using this for almost 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t gotten any zits (knock on wood!). It feels really light and natural on my skin. It has not dried my skin what so ever. Probably because I moisturize before I apply it to my skin and after I take it off. The only problem I had was the color being a little dark for me. I purchased it in Cinnamon. I am lightly tanned but forgot that my face and neck is way lighter than my body. So I am thinking about purchasing it maybe in ivory and maybe mixing the two together or just going out and getting a better tan. Overall, I am VERY happy with the product. If you are prone to acne, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Bella Pierre as I was walking through a mall and it was being sold at a kiosk and a sales girl who worked there stopped me. I bought this foundation originally from there. When it ran out I bought it on amazon because it&#x27;s difficult to find stores that sell this brand, and the kiosk where I first bought it no longer existed. In the past I have tried mineral based cosmetics such as the Bare Minerals brand, and had varying degrees of success with their products. Although I prefer Bare Minerals blush and their finishing powder called mineral veil, in my opinion Bella Pierre foundation is FAR superior to the foundation made by Bare Minerals. First of all it works EXTREMELY well as a spot concealer, it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes as easily as Bare Minerals and it lasts all day with minimal maintenance. This is by far the best mineral foundation I have ever tried. It is also much cheaper here on amazon than you can find it for retail sale, assuming you even can find it in stores. Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it! I also advise you invest and buy their concealer brush, kabuki brush and face primer. Those products used in conjunction with this foundation REALLY make a difference and your skin will look flawless!</li>
