      <li>My cousin recommended this brand and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking for a little more thickness and coverage than this.</li>
      <li>and it covers dark circles far better.  </li>
      <li>New fav drug store concealer.</li>
      <li>Demablend will make your skin break out and Clinique&#x27;s Advanced concealer is too heavy.</li>
      <li>A good test is to do one eye, look in the mirror and if it still looks the same as the other eye or worse, throw it out.  </li>

    <li> Awesome drug store concealer!! Great coverage! New fav drug store concealer.</li>
    <li> ried Maybelline&#x27;s Master Conceal today and did not like it.  I use  Maybelline Super Stay 24 and it covers dark circles far better.  Master Conceal is creamier, thinner and did nothing except make my skin burn, shine and cause blemishes.  It contains polypropylene glycol and dimethicone.  Super Stay 24 is easier to apply and lasts until I wash it off again. It is also great for covering blemishes. Many years ago I used Maybelline&#x27;s Erase and it made my skin break out around my eyes. So far, Super Stay is the best one I have found. Read the reviews for it on Amazon. A good test is to do one eye, look in the mirror and if it still looks the same as the other eye or worse, throw it out.  Demablend will make your skin break out and Clinique&#x27;s Advanced concealer is too heavy. Clinique does have a great oil free powder blush for problem, acne prone skin  It is the one in the silver cases, not the green cases.  Some of the reviews I have read I believe are written by ringers.  I love Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this best concealer. .Don&#x27;t need a lot and a wet beauty blinder looks amazing</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as heavy as I was expecting. I have VERY dark circles and with this I still needed foundation and powder.</li>
    <li> This is another winner from Maybelline. They seem to be coming out with better and better products at a moderate price. The New York Face Studio Master Concealer is as good as you&#x27;d get at a much more pricey department store cosmetics counter. There&#x27;s significant coverage here, with no heavy look. If your skin gets to be oily by the end of the day, I&#x27;d recommend a touch of powder to set. You will not be disappointed by this product!</li>
    <li> I think it is great for the price. Excellent blendabilty and coverage but not sure if it is waterproof like Makeup forever but a good dupe for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Probably needed a darker shade but great concealer overall</li>
    <li> Never used it in my life, but this i love and will get it again :)</li>
    <li> For sure buy again.. covers my rocacia so well can&#x27;t  even tell I have it.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite concealer ever !! It works amazing at concealing and high lighting ! My holy grail !</li>
    <li> Hands down the best concealer. Creamy formula with great coverage. It even helps to high light when contouring. I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! For the first time, I feel like I have found a product that covers my under eye circles and hides any blemish. It is the best makeup product I have found in years.</li>
    <li> Not the best coverage, but not the worst either. Doesn&#x27;t offer maximum coverage, so I only use it in a few places on my face. Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this again. Tube will last you forever though.</li>
    <li> My cousin recommended this brand and I really like it. I think the coverage is fantastic</li>
    <li> Well, let&#x27;s just say I am still looking for a go-to concealer. The coverage is so so. I&#x27;m looking for a little more thickness and coverage than this. But have yet to find a drugstore concealer with really good coverage. This was just not it for me.</li>
    <li> full coverage when ever i need it, smooth and gentle on the skin</li>
    <li> This is the best concealer I have used to cover dark undereye circles</li>
    <li> Received used item.😠😠😠</li>
    <li> This concealer works perfect for me. It covers so well and isn&#x27;t too heavy or thick. Best drug store concealer.</li>
    <li> great product for reasonable price.</li>
