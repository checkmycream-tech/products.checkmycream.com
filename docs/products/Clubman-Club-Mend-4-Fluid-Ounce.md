      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This is the best after shave treatment available, so now I have to stock up.  </li>

      <li>Another nice product from Clubman Pinaud.</li>
      <li>continue to purchase; a nice savings</li>
      <li>Despite following all of the shaving best practices (heat, moisture, exfoliation, good shaving cream, direction of razor...</li>
      <li>This product was very strong and in the end it did not cure my issues.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great and does exactly what is advertised to do.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I have purchased over time4-5 bottles love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Clubman Gel resolves most of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve become more confident with my shaving change from electric to razor.</li>
      <li>I love the product and will order more.</li>
      <li>My clients love it</li>
      <li>I shave more often now that i use clubman bump repair gel.</li>
      <li>I am not 100% sure yet the product does what it claims it does.</li>
      <li>(probably stock up on it with several bottles) and would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for the perfect after shave burn treatment.</li>
      <li>put it on after washing your face clean after a good,close shave and it does its magic.  </li>
      <li>Got rid of all razor bumps and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
      <li>I use it mixed with aftershave and aloe gel--works great that way for me.</li>
      <li>After some research Amazon has the best prices, I like that it doesnt burn much and does reduce the ingrowns and bumps on your face neck and back of your scalp if you get a razor shave.</li>
      <li>While the scent is very intriguing, wish it smelled like Clubman Pinaud AS.</li>
      <li>Well worth the purchase price!</li>
      <li>Preps your face, opens pores and leaves your face clean before applying shave cream, I recommend this product.</li>
      <li>What I found in this product is nothing that special.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully it disappeared quickly also.</li>
      <li>The brisk yet soothing combination of alcohol, salicylic acid and virtually no fragrance meant it would close my pores avoiding bacterial infection, evaporate quickly leaving no residual stickiness and the salicylic acid (aspirin)</li>
      <li>The product does dissipate quickly – or maybe absorb into your skin?  </li>
      <li>It immediately provides a slight (but pleasant) burn, to let you know where you need it, then total calm and a very nice suave feeling.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product actually does help with reducing razor bumps.</li>
      <li>Going on it has an antiseptic smell to it that disappears as it is absorbed into your skin.</li>
      <li>worth a try.</li>
      <li>Now with the Clubman right after shaving (ALUM BLOC FIRST)and @ bedtime with a splash of Shea Moisture after shave.</li>
      <li>So the first use after a razor shave using the Personna Safety Razor the sting was minimal which was quit surprising</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this after shave balm I knew it was the right product for me.  </li>
      <li>My only concern is that the smell is somewhat strong, though it does go away rather quickly.</li>
      <li>When you first put it on you will be overcome by the alcohol smell.  </li>
      <li>I like men’s facial products and Clubman is a favorite of mine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now using a Phillips wet// dry rotary shaver (wet works great).</li>
      <li>He uses this more reliably than the acne wash, and it has a nice, faint scent to it.  </li>
      <li>I used a razor to shave my head and neck (since I have a beard) to determine whether the product really works.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is not overpowering though and disappears fast.  </li>
      <li>This really works on bumps after shaving.  </li>
      <li>this really works well for me</li>
      <li>The only thing I wish this product had was the fragrance of the original Clubman</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for guys with razor bumps..</li>
      <li>there is hardly no irritation.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>Its worth the price and lasts long as well.</li>
      <li>This contains salicylic acid, the ingredient in acne facial washes such as Clean &amp; Clear.  </li>
      <li>With sensitive skin I was wary of razors I had been using High Time Bump Stopper for some 20 yrs with good results</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a short time and it has really helped in solving skin irritation and ingrown beard problems.</li>
      <li>This product not only helps the old bumps disappear, but it also stops any new inflammation from happening.</li>
      <li>But watch out, too much WILL dry your skin out, and sometimes when I apply lotion afterwards, it clunks up.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for my son, who developed pimples when he started shaving, only where he shaves.  </li>
      <li>a clean, tight afterglow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so bummed that Pinaud/Clubman have decided to discontinue this product and if any representative of that company reads this, please consider that you do have a loyal consumer base out here who&#x27;d buy lots more of your product.  </li>
      <li>It is a thick, clear product that you apply with your hands right after your alum block.</li>

<li> Product works well enough, have used other products with salicylic acid in it.</li>
<li> but it fell into the same category with all other products that claim yo cure follicullitis barbae</li>
<li> I have added some raw shea butter to keep the skin soft.</li>
<li> I got this facial product not really knowing what it does other than sooths irritation.  </li>
<li> Has stopped me and my clients from getting any razor bumps and although I thought I&#x27;d prefer a cream to a gel, I have to say, this gel soaks in really quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy, pore blocking weight behind like creams I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
<li> Not much to say that my title doesn&#x27;t</li>

<li> Stuff seems to work well to close pores and moisturize a little.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this product on my head after I shave all the time. It helps prevent bumps and it smells good as u apply it and was also referred by a barber so no complaints as of yet.</li>
    <li> Stuff seems to work well to close pores and moisturize a little.  Seems to basically be alcohol, glycerin, and some salcylic acid (aspirin or willow bark).  I use it mixed with aftershave and aloe gel--works great that way for me.</li>
    <li> Amazing product actually does help with reducing razor bumps.</li>
    <li> Another nice product from Clubman Pinaud.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clubman Bump Repair Gel for about 5 years now and I&#x27;m so bummed to learn that they&#x27;ve discontinued manufacturing it.  This is the best after shave treatment available, so now I have to stock up.  Despite following all of the shaving best practices (heat, moisture, exfoliation, good shaving cream, direction of razor...etc., living in Arizona with our wicked summer heat, I&#x27;d often get get razor burn, irritation and ingrown hairs.  Clubman Gel resolves most of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You put it on after washing your face clean after a good,close shave and it does its magic.  The brisk yet soothing combination of alcohol, salicylic acid and virtually no fragrance meant it would close my pores avoiding bacterial infection, evaporate quickly leaving no residual stickiness and the salicylic acid (aspirin) drastically reduces inflammation, outbreaks and in-growns.  There&#x27;s virtually no odor or fragrance to compete with my cologne or other body treatments -- just a clean, tight afterglow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so bummed that Pinaud/Clubman have decided to discontinue this product and if any representative of that company reads this, please consider that you do have a loyal consumer base out here who&#x27;d buy lots more of your product.  Hopefully like Cher or Barbra Streisand you&#x27;ll have a come-back tour some day!</li>
    <li> Not much to say that my title doesn&#x27;t but it bears repeating. Has stopped me and my clients from getting any razor bumps and although I thought I&#x27;d prefer a cream to a gel, I have to say, this gel soaks in really quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy, pore blocking weight behind like creams I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I was introduced to it by a barber 2 years ago and it is difficult to find at regular stores. Happy to find it on Amazon. Preps your face, opens pores and leaves your face clean before applying shave cream, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders but stinks to high heaven. Thankfully it disappeared quickly also.</li>
    <li> This really works on bumps after shaving.  My clients love it</li>
    <li> I currently use a Melaleuca product called Alloy for my after shave balm.  It is very good and I have been happy with it.  I decided to experiment with this product, because I like Clubman after shave.  The first time I tried this after shave balm I knew it was the right product for me.  It is a thick, clear product that you apply with your hands right after your alum block. Going on it has an antiseptic smell to it that disappears as it is absorbed into your skin. It immediately provides a slight (but pleasant) burn, to let you know where you need it, then total calm and a very nice suave feeling.  Razor burn disappears immediately.  You can then apply your scented after shave lotion of choice.  I will buy this again (probably stock up on it with several bottles) and would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for the perfect after shave burn treatment.</li>
    <li> Great product. Removed bumps just like the product says.</li>
    <li> I like men’s facial products and Clubman is a favorite of mine.  I got this facial product not really knowing what it does other than sooths irritation.  What I found in this product is nothing that special.  When you first put it on you will be overcome by the alcohol smell.  It does dissipate past though. Imagine ispropyl alcohol in a gel form.  What the remaining scent is smells like floral – not clubman like at all.  It is not overpowering though and disappears fast.  The product does dissipate quickly – or maybe absorb into your skin?  What you are left with is a sticky and tacky feeling skin.  I have been putting on a moisturizer or balm because I can’t imaging leaving your facial skin alone after putting this stuff on.&lt;br /&gt;Will use it up but will not be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> My barber would always use this prodcut after a cut and a shave, I asked him where he got it and told me any barber shop would have it. After some research Amazon has the best prices, I like that it doesnt burn much and does reduce the ingrowns and bumps on your face neck and back of your scalp if you get a razor shave. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Product works well enough, have used other products with salicylic acid in it. The only thing I wish this product had was the fragrance of the original Clubman After Shave. While the scent is very intriguing, wish it smelled like Clubman Pinaud AS.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son, who developed pimples when he started shaving, only where he shaves.  This contains salicylic acid, the ingredient in acne facial washes such as Clean &amp; Clear.  He uses this more reliably than the acne wash, and it has a nice, faint scent to it.  I don&#x27;t know what percentage of salicylic acid it contains, but my son feels the result is similar to Bump Patrol.  I notice the bottle application seems neater than Bump Patrol&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase; a nice savings when its on Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and does exactly what is advertised to do.And that is remove hair bumps or ingrown hairs.I have purchased over time4-5 bottles love this stuff.Just apply it and let it do the work.Its a part of my daily face treatment.Well worth the purchase price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m black so I tend to use clippers since I get razor bumps when I use a razor. I used a razor to shave my head and neck (since I have a beard) to determine whether the product really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product worked for my neck but not my head. If you are just using it for the face/neck area you should be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like the fact that I can use a razor on my face.</li>
    <li> Razor burn, nicks and irritations seem to disappear instantly!  Pleasant smell, quick drying and awesome closure cap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never use another product again,I&#x27;ve found what works. Got rid of all razor bumps and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Perfect for after shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become more confident with my shaving change from electric to razor. With sensitive skin I was wary of razors I had been using High Time Bump Stopper for some 20 yrs with good results and I wanted to try something new. So the first use after a razor shave using the Personna Safety Razor the sting was minimal which was quit surprising I&#x27;ll continue using for a few shaves and report how its going&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE** Clubman saved my face this really works well for me Bump Stopper is on the back shelf. I&#x27;ll update again in two weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed the game again went back to electric shaving  my D.E shaving techniques were not good I&#x27;m now using a Phillips wet// dry rotary shaver (wet works great). Now with the Clubman right after shaving (ALUM BLOC FIRST)and @ bedtime with a splash of Shea Moisture after shave. The bumps are under control I have added some raw shea butter to keep the skin soft. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product was very strong and in the end it did not cure my issues. I hoped this could end my embarrassing razor bumps on my nape but it fell into the same category with all other products that claim yo cure follicullitis barbae</li>
    <li> I am not 100% sure yet the product does what it claims it does. I does not seem to stop the bleeding on razor cuts or improve ingrown hairs....</li>
    <li> Excellent Product.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a short time and it has really helped in solving skin irritation and ingrown beard problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had bad razor bumps and this is the first product that has actually worked for me. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone whose had bad razor bumps with ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> I will say that if you suffer from razor bumps and use this stuff you will not be sorry.  I had razor bumps and was having a horrible time getting rid of them.  After using this product for a few days the bumps are just about gone.</li>
    <li> This is the only ingrown hair formula that seems to work.  But watch out, too much WILL dry your skin out, and sometimes when I apply lotion afterwards, it clunks up.  But note that not EVERY lotion does this, so it isn&#x27;t a big deal, and is a necessary evil for this great product</li>
    <li> My husband has suffered from razor bumps for 16 years. This product not only helps the old bumps disappear, but it also stops any new inflammation from happening. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This product does what it promises to do, no question about it. My only concern is that the smell is somewhat strong, though it does go away rather quickly. Its worth the price and lasts long as well.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for guys with razor bumps..Take out ingrown hair than put this on</li>
    <li> I love this product. it helps in keeping the in grown hairs from forming. I shave more often now that i use clubman bump repair gel. there is hardly no irritation. I love the product and will order more. I have already recommended this product to every shaving man I know.</li>
