<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great selection and nice quality.</li>
    <li> Work great.  Good deal.</li>
    <li> One of the handles is a bit loose; other than that, no problems whatsoever. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Best makeup brushes .....I love these brushes</li>
    <li> Great buy - good make up brushes..very pleased.</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft.  Love how it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these brushes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price, I like it but would definitely buy something better next time.  Also, the brushes should have written the use in each one</li>
    <li> Nice brush set very good for travel. Has all the essential brushes need to do full make up application. These are not natural bristles</li>
    <li> The quality is ok. I washed them and they all did well with the exception of the smallest flat head brush. It fell apart, so now I have a 10 pc set. The bag they came in was poor quality. I will keep these but will not order again.</li>
    <li> As a person that is constantly upgrading to better brushes and makeup, I can say I have never owned brushes this good (And I have expensive Sephora brushes and many other premium brand name brushes). They are way better in person, and are softer than any synthetic brushes i have ever felt. Never have i been so impressed with cheap makeup brushes. They feel so soft on the skin and truly are a must-have for anyone that uses makeup. And come on, for the price? If you&#x27;re skeptical, just buy them and see for yourself. I am one happy customer!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how amazing these are!!!! They are sooooo super soft and make my makeup process a charm!!!! And the price is even better might just repurchase to have more love them!</li>
    <li> Great deal! These were delivered fast and lived up to my expectations!</li>
    <li> So soft , and the bag holds alot of brushes</li>
    <li> These are soft and very well made brushes. I&#x27;m glad I got them, they are great for my powder/cream makeup regiment.</li>
    <li> Great variety of brushes but they are not the best quality.  They shed quite a bit but they are soft and do an okay job.  I bought them as travel brushes and I love the little bag they came in.  I will most likely keep looking for something of better quality but these will do for now.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes. Can never have enough.</li>
    <li> These are the softest brushes ever! My only complete is that they come in a lil sack rather then a brush holder but its grate to toss in your purse for tuch ups</li>
    <li> These are my first makeup brushes (so my review may not be that helpful)  and I was pleased with how soft they were. They smell a little like chemicals at first so I washed them with a light shampoo before use. The hairs don&#x27;t really seem to fall out, although there were maybe 2 or 3. My only complaint about this product is that the image is somewhat misleading: there is no angled eye brush in this set, and the brushes are a little bigger than I expected. I still used them for eyeshadow and they did a great job (was using my finger before).</li>
    <li> I just received my package today and I absolutely love them! They&#x27;re of wonderful quality and are ubber soft. Very great for the price I am surprised I recommend you buy these!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!  Great price too!</li>
    <li> Durable and soft. They work great</li>
    <li> They are good brushes, except for the kabuki not as thick as I would want it.</li>
    <li> Received all of them so that&#x27;s a plus the brushes are really soft only bad thing was that they bag smelled really bad but the brushes didn&#x27;t so that was good but overall I will recommend them!</li>
    <li> Good quality  but the smaller shorter  brush shreds  a lot of hair it went straight  to the garbage. .!!</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t good, but i guess good dnough for the price</li>
    <li> Great deal, very nice brushes for price!!</li>
    <li> The hairs of one of the brushes weren&#x27;t even glued/secured into the handle.  Right after I opened it I took one of the brushes and all the hairs fell out in my hand.  Not the biggest deal as it was only 1 of the 11 brushes.</li>
    <li> Bristles have come out on some of the brushes, others seem okay so far. You get what you pay for on this - not going to be a set that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> What a nice brush set. for the price what a steal!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great, so glad I ordered them and got them pretty quickly too.</li>
    <li> Soft and full, great quality and a steal at that price!</li>
    <li> Great makeup brushes. I am a novice and these brushes are great for the minimal amount of makeup I use. They are also great for someone heavily into makeup.</li>
    <li> Great product! I find the brushes soft and they work well. Great price as well</li>
    <li> Omg I love this so much, I ordered it and it arrived two one day later and the brushes are soft yet sterdy and it&#x27;s great will order again.</li>
    <li> Handles not the same type of brown. Packaging is not great quality. Brush hairs do not look of great quality.</li>
    <li> I love this brushes!!! Someone said something about them smelling, I didn&#x27;t notice any smell. This don&#x27;t shed any hair. Glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been one to just use the brushes that come along with my makeup or to purchase individual brushes when I needed them. I decided that I would just purchase a set to replace what I had on hand. This set is incredible. I was simply amazed at the softness of the bristles. My makeup also went in my smoother than using my previous methods making it look much more natural and subtle for summer.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves them.  The bristles are very soft and gentle on the face.</li>
    <li> Great makeup brushes especially for the price</li>
    <li> This brushes are life, they are so soft and well made, I use it to apply my makeup, they do wonders, love love love this set &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They&#x27;re soft, but not so soft they don&#x27;t pick up product. I&#x27;m a huge fan and really recommend them to someone who wants nice brushes but doesn&#x27;t want to spend an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> Awesome my makeup looks flawless</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great Quality! I order my first set from another seller and loved them so much that I ordered another set.</li>
    <li> These brushes feel fantastic. There&#x27;s a brush for every need...except for a brow/lash brush, hence the 4 not 5 stars. As for quality you definitely feel like you&#x27;re getting much more for your money.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes for personal and professional use.</li>
    <li> These brushes work great!</li>
    <li> The Brush set is so awesome ! very soft and nice quality. It picks up product fairly. After washing, they didn&#x27;t degrade with the quality as well. I really don&#x27;t need to buy expensive brushes for my make up now. As they do the job pretty well ! I am happy with the purchase :)</li>
    <li> I was quite happy with the product for the first purchase. However, after a few times ordering, I noticed that the quality wasn&#x27;t stable, not very bad but not as good as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst is that some brushes were missing. 2 out of 3 packages missed 2 brushes. Would give it more stars if this didn&#x27;t happen</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m learning how to use make up brushes and these are wonderful starter brushes!</li>
    <li> The packages has all the type of brushes you need but some are better than some. They skimped on the bristles. They&#x27;re not firm enough. They are soft though. If they are for practise or personal use they could work but if you&#x27;re a professional makeup artist you won&#x27;t be very please.</li>
    <li> Good quality items.  Price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my teen and now I&#x27;m ordering some for me. Extremely soft. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> These are great quality especially for the price. I wear heavy makeup, and the brushes work like magic. They are on equal par to the brushed I used to pay 4xs as much for at sephora and mac. I definitely like the bamboo handle. Only suggestion is I wish it came in a case instead of a bag. Easily remedied though.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Honestly I wasn&#x27;t not expect much for the brushes , but it was worse than I expected.</li>
    <li> For the price... OMG these are awesome, they are soft and they apply so smoothly I LOVE THEM... Fantastic buy.</li>
    <li> I saw this product for several months but was not sure of purchase. I decided that I needed a brush to melt my foundation with concealer. The product arrived in good time and the quality is excellent. The termination of the brushes is very good and not loose hairs as others. The tips are sueves so do not damage the skin. All women of the family want. CONGRATULATIONS</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and I haven&#x27;t had one shed on me yet. I am very happy with these brushes and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for the price.  They feel smooth and haven&#x27;t noticed any real loss of brush hair.  Clean and dry great.  I have brought some expensive ones but like these much better!!  I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very soft love the brushes</li>
    <li> The brush part does not hold make on your brush while applying cheap, I do like the eyebrow make up applicator</li>
    <li> These brushed are great. Very soft and easy to clean. The ones I use for foundation and powder have very short handles but still work perfectly. I don&#x27;t feel that these brushes steal any of the product and do a great job of spreading it around evenly. The eyeliner brush is very skinny and has a sharp point, perfect for gel eyeliner. The other eye brushes are great for blending eyeshadow, though the flat brush is more for applying loose or glitter eyeshadow. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase especially since they feel fantastic and cost very little.</li>
    <li> These brushes are soft and easy to clean. I have had them a few months. They are great for giving me a professional application. Only one brush seems to be barely shedding which could be from how I store them. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very nice makeup brushes... My Daughter-in-law and Daughter really like them.</li>
    <li> Great longevity.  I usually buy those really expensive brush set but this price and the quality of this product won me over.  This proves that you do not need an expensive makeup brush for the quality look.  These brushes are great for any professional makeup kit.  Easy to clean. And does not shed to much.  The bristles are soft and the brush helps apply a flawless look.  Always in my to-go makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes and i am excited to use but it smells very weird when i got them.. The hair on the brushes smelled funky like vinegar and glue mixed ahaha I recommend washing them before using!</li>
    <li> delivery was fast and i do like the brushes,cute and inexpensive set of brushes!i like the size of them so they are easy to travel with</li>
    <li> Good product, good service.</li>
    <li> Love love love these brushes. I&#x27;m a makeup enthusiast and for brushes on a budget, these are phenomenal. Super silky and soft. Good variety of brushes for all your makeup needs. My favorites are definitely the kabuki brush, the contour/highlight brush and the large blending brush. I was skeptical to buy these because of the low price, but they really are great quality brushes for someone on a budget.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  This is a steal!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes for a great price.</li>
    <li> So far these brushes are great. This is my first set of makeup brushes and I wish I would have bought them sooner! This makes it so much easier to apply makeup than the applicators that come with the makeup.  The brushes are soft and seem to hold product without significant fall out.  Great deal for the price.  I&#x27;m sure you could spend more and get a slightly better quality,  but these are good enough for me!</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived yesterday and I was very excited upon opening the package. So soft and seem very well made for its price! One problem is that when I was washing them, a few were already shedding which is weird since I&#x27;ve read from past reviews that they don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. Really soft but firm.  For a starter set these are perfect.</li>
    <li> for the price this brush set is awesome. I got one for me and one for my mom. This was one of my favorite deals all year.</li>
    <li> Love them.  Very soft and functional.</li>
    <li> Some of the brushes in this set I liked but some where not good quality, if you are use to buying name brand brushes don&#x27;t expect these to be the same.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft and the shipping was quick</li>
    <li> Love these! don&#x27;t shed at all, such a great variety of brushes and quality for the price, I&#x27;m very pleased with these brushes</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> These brushes are not only soft and no doubt high-end but they&#x27;re eco-friendly! I&#x27;m actually very new to make up application myself, but all the brushes I ever picked up while scratching my head in confusion, some being of Maybeline brand and some of Sephora (so expensive) don&#x27;t begin to compare! In fact, during my make-up exploration endeavors I found what these are probably perfect DUPES of! I&#x27;m not sure if Amazon would let me put a link in my description but if you&#x27;ve ever seen the brand of brushes EVERYDAY MINERALS, the product received in the mail is exactly like them in color, description, and look. If you see in the picture, they are of a black shade for the 11pcs, however the ones you receive sort of have a maroon shade JUST LIKE Everyday Minerals. They&#x27;re very professional and are on many make-up blogs. Anyway, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase since it was such a great deal to get a lot of brushes to further understand the world of make-up. I&#x27;m lucky to have found a brand of brushes I&#x27;ll more than likely be sticking to for a long time.</li>
    <li> 11 brushes exactly the same as the picture depicts with the bag. Each brush was individualy  wraped. Instant delivery. Excellent product for the price. I would recomend to others.</li>
    <li> I love them. I really recommend these. They blend perfectly.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Product was shipped ASAP. Soft brushes!</li>
    <li> Great Brushes, the quality of the hair is amazing, i love them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are really amazing they are soft and fluffy. When I washed them they didn&#x27;t shed and they look like high quality brushes for the price. Oh and another plus they are vegan yaaaayyy!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh! Dude, forget about sigma, real tech, mac, this is the best deal ever and the quality is incredible!!!</li>
    <li> super soft, and i like the quality</li>
    <li> Great brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> I love love love my blushes</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft, there is only one brush i didn&#x27;t like. Totally worth buying if you are just getting into makeup and need something affordable.</li>
    <li> I love these! Super soft bristles,  and many different brushes for different needs. Each of my makeup products now have their own brush which I love!! They seem to be nice and heavy and they blend and apply makeup smoothly and evenly. I&#x27;m using a lot less foundation and powder with these since the brush doesn&#x27;t hold it all like others I have had before.</li>
    <li> Brushes are exceptionally soft/smooth to the touch. Applies awesomely. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I got this order from EverdayLucky. I know these come from different sellers so they all might be different quality. The ones I received were really soft and I like how it feels on my skin. The eyeshadow brushes picked up the colors okay. What I really was disappointed about was the bigger stippling brush. After the 2nd use, the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; were coming out all over my face. I guess you really get what you paid for. For the price I paid, it&#x27;s not bad though. I guess I have to invest some money in a sigma brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes came in sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these brushes is very good. I have bought very expensive makeup brushes and the quality of those does not even come close to these. Very soft and gentle on skin during makeup application. I would definitely repurchase these brushes.</li>
    <li> For this price, how could you not love them!?</li>
    <li> This is a good value for a made in China product.&lt;br /&gt;lots of brushes in variety of sizes and the bristols did not fall out.</li>
    <li> As stated in the description, the brushes are very soft and easy to use. My shipment arrived on time and the brushes are great to have!</li>
    <li> These brushes are truly amazing for such a low price! They have beautiful wooden handles with super soft bristles that do not shed! They are so well designed it makes make up application a breeze. I should have upgraded my brushes to these a long time ago. Don&#x27;t hesitate to order.</li>
    <li> as soon as I got the brush set some of the brushes had came apart.. not so great of a brush kit.</li>
    <li> Feel smooth. Didn&#x27;t have an odor whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. The only issue I had is a wired smell that it had. Hopefully it goes away after I shampoo it! The wooden handles makes it look quite expensive. This is a good set for someone who does not need a ton of brushes for makeup. Very practical and easily usable!</li>
    <li> Great it came in on time &amp; the product is most definitely what I excepted! Loved the brushes they&#x27;re soft and work super well</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! The shipping was fast &amp; it was worth it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED these. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED these. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED these. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED these. i really think that these are more than worth what you are spending, i finally have some organic beautiful soft brushes that i love.</li>
    <li> These brushes are better quality than I was expecting.  They do have a weird synthetic smell to it, but the bristles are very soft and seem to pick up makeup well.</li>
    <li> They smell funny! Other than that, workable! Seller was prompt in sending them on time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Amazing value! The brushes are so so soft and seem to be very well made. Washed beautifully. These are not high end brushes nor comparable to high end, but they are an AWESOME purchase for the price! Highly recommend trying them if you&#x27;re looking for a few nice brushes to add to your collection.</li>
    <li> Super soft brushes but dense enough to hold product and apply! I specifically bought these so I have brushes available at my moms house and it&#x27;s a complete set to do my whole face!  Great set for an awesome price!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Very smooth and soft!!! Just as pictured. No brand.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived fast, via US postal certified mail. Less than 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Magic brush with low price still enjoying with these.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Great price and great quality</li>
    <li> Reasonably good set for the price. Overwhelming number of brushes &amp; the quality is... well reasonable. Does the job.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so great!! The bristles are super soft and the brushes themselves are super dense. I was really surprised because for the pice I thought they were going to be not the best quality. I love them more than some of my name brand brushes. It&#x27;s a must have!!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are good quality and cruelty free which is exactly what I wanted. However, they are MUCH smaller in size compared to previous make-up brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great find, good quality n brush for every need</li>
    <li> LOVED THEM, VERY SOFT.</li>
    <li> Very good quality brushes will buy again</li>
    <li> amazing brush set. i use everysingle brush. the blending brush is great and all the brushes are dense. i uswe the small dense brush for highlighting. there is a blush brush a small flat top kabuki, a flat top brush, a concealer brush, foundation brush, face brush, pencil brush, 2 eyeshadow brushes, and and angle brush.- XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Very amazing quality at a very affordable price</li>
    <li> Very good quality, I didn&#x27;t expect much of this product due to its price.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes there supper soft and look durable...I also love the fast shipping...so overall there really affortable and I really recommend them!</li>
    <li> The brushes weren&#x27;t as big as I expected</li>
    <li> Great brushes many different varieties</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing</li>
    <li> Beautiful brush set it&#x27;s just what I needed really good quality and it looks like real wood.</li>
    <li> Great buy, I love them</li>
    <li> I love the packaging of the brushes. The bag is a nice canvas and each brush came individually wrapped. The brushes themselves appear to be nice but unfortunately I get so much shedding from some of the brushes. Literally chunks of the brush will come out so easily. They are nice for putting makeup on and are very soft and I want to like them more but I feel like soon I&#x27;m not going to have any brush left on certain ones because they shed so much. They will hold me over until I can get some higher quality makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I love my brush set!!!</li>
    <li> doesnt earn the one star that Amazon is making me rate to write this. Freaking empty sticks. No brushes in some, low quality of what us intact</li>
    <li> Very sturdy brushes. No fall out. Soft. Can&#x27;t believe the price</li>
    <li> I have purchased many high end brushes over the years and typically prefer Bare Minerals ... These are by far the softest, most durable, and most affordable  brushes I have ever used!!! They are a steal at twice the price!</li>
    <li> They were just as described by the seller and the reviews of other costumers. I loved them! Excellent brushes for their price.</li>
    <li> They are ok. I was expecting a better quality in the flat buffer, but work fine.</li>
    <li> Great brushes; but, don&#x27;t purchase unless you are prepared to wash them all before use (pain in the butt).  They smell horrible!! I would have preferred to purchase my usual Eco Tools brushes due to the convenience of not having to wash before use.</li>
    <li> This is awesome. Very soft to the skin. I have enough selections for different needs.</li>
    <li> More brushes than I will ever use, so i shared some with my daughters. Nice quality - pleased with my purchase 😊</li>
    <li> The brushes were soft but they lose the bristles..or &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; constantly. They get everywhere. On your face, clothes...in your eyes.</li>
    <li> I have had these brushes for exactly a year now. Which means I&#x27;ve used them about everyday since then, sometimes twice a day. Out of this whole set I can cpunt maybe 5 brushes that the wooden part hasn&#x27;t came off. (Was an easy fix btw). Besides that the makeup brushes weren&#x27;t all that bad.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to someone who is a makeup junkie like I am. You&#x27;re gonna need more durable longer lasting brushes! Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Great Brushes for the price!! I love how they were packaged and they are very soft. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly high quality product. The brushes are really soft and don&#x27;t fall out of the brushes which usually happens just a little bit with new brushes. It has a great eye blending brush that reminds me a lot of the Sigma E-35. Overall, I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that the &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; brush isn&#x27;t quite dense enough to be a true kabuki brush, and is basically the same thing as the flat top kabuki included in this set with a shorter handle. I don&#x27;t think either of those brushes are quite dense enough to use for foundation (think sigma F-80), but would do in a pinch and would be great for blending.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles on all the brushes, the eye shadow holds powder eye shadow great and i love the way the foundation brush applies liquid. I started doing my power concealer last and using the dome top brush is fantastic. I also bought a second set for my sister, I think they&#x27;re great for her because these are vegan brushes. the kabuki brush isn&#x27;t as full as other kabuki brushes but it&#x27;s still useful. I personally love all the small brushes, even though some reviews complained that there were too many small brushes and not enough large ones. For me it was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would have to say if you&#x27;re really into doing your eyes and just simple face makeup then this is the perfect brush set for you.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes besttttttt</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently gotten into makeup and I purchased these. First of all I love them. I use them everyday and there so soft and uhh! I don&#x27;t know how they compare to high priced brushes at all but they are great for the price. I deffenantly recommend these to people.</li>
    <li> i received  my brushes a few days before the expected date! i was so so happy  also the brushes are very soft on my skin and they apply very well so far .. so for brushes that aren&#x27;t expensive i say you should consider purchasing this because they&#x27;re great quality and they&#x27;re adorable too</li>
    <li> A couple of the brushes started to fall apart after only a couple weeks!  Specifically, the couple that I used daily (powder and foundation stipple one).  I washed them a couple times and they were obviously not built to withstand this.  The other brushes are still holding together, although I do not use them as frequently.  Unfortunate, as I did enjoy using them when they were holding together :(.</li>
    <li> The brushes are so soft and are relaxing to the touch. I definately recommend them! :-)</li>
    <li> I really loved these brushes; no loose brissels</li>
    <li> Product:&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, just like professional brushes and no breaking/shedding so far (I use them every day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller: Came in sooner than expected, perfect condition.</li>
    <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t very good. Some of the hairs were put on backwards where the hard part is on top and the soft white part is in the bottom. Very bad quality.</li>
    <li> good deal,they shed a lot.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes and have owned many of the higher end brands as well. These are synthetic which isn&#x27;t really a turn off for me, I wanted something cruelty free. The smell as many have said isn&#x27;t from the brushes but the bag it comes in. Problem solved I threw the bag away.</li>
    <li> Just got them today and they suprised me by how amaxingly soft they are!! Great great value!! If you&#x27;re considering getting these, do it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes soft and no shedding  blend well</li>
    <li> The quality of these is amazing! At first, they had a very strong smell but just let them breathe for a few minutes and wash them, and the smell should go away.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great set! The smell of the bag is a little odd, chemical type smell. But the brushes are soft and are holding up quite well to daily use. For 12 bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes are good for the price but they shed quite a lot. And I haven&#x27;t even washed them yet!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> I use these for brushing off lemel when making jewelry. They are FANTASTICALLY soft and I&#x27;m totally happy to have found such a great alternative to natural bristles.</li>
    <li> After reading the great reviews on the DragonPad 11-Piece makeup brush set, great quality for low price, I bought these in June. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. With such a variety of brushes, I&#x27;m beginning to learn the unique uses for each type of brush. Unlike other low-cost brushes I&#x27;ve bought in the past, these have easy to grip wooden handles and bristles with no falling hairs. I liked these so much, I purchased another set in August as a gift for my older sister, somewhat a makeup connoisseur. She loves her set of brushes, too.</li>
    <li> They look short in the picture but pretty big brushes totally love them!</li>
    <li> I decided to revamp my makeup tools and supplies and bought these brushes. I found they work really well and feel good on your face; they never shed hairs and despite some people saying it smelled strange when it arrived in the package I found it was totally fine. A very good buy for the more savvy gal looking to have spin-off brushes modeled after the more expensive brands like Sigma.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! However it took forever to come!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes!!!! Definatly worth the price, so soft, doesn&#x27;t lose bristles (so far), they did have a bad chemically smell but it goes away!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used them all but for the price the quality seems excellent. After use for 6 months and I wash and reuse them I will update to let you all know how the brush is hold up. I also would like to add that they blend beautifully and apply the color very softly with out any tugging or poking at your delicate eye lid area.</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes!  I have been using oversized brushes for eyeshadow, and there are many to choose from in this bunch.  This is really a great deal- you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I have had this set for over a month and I love the wooden handles, and I have not seen any &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; from the super soft brushes.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this set after researching many on Amazon- this was the best set for me.</li>
    <li> I thought they would be a bit cheap, used them so far and they feel great, so soft&lt;br /&gt;not really stiff enough for foundation they are extremely soft as if for powders and such&lt;br /&gt;have to keep using them and see how they work out for me..</li>
    <li> i was not expecting such a good quality brushes so cheap. i definitely advise you to buy it. i already washed them many times.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. I washed them after receiving them and they don&#x27;t have any odor currently. The bristles are soft and all the different types are so useful. I find the brushes are not as dense as I expected but they still work well. Delivery took a little too long though (3 weeks I think?) so I probably would not order these again unless I knew way in advance that I needed them.</li>
    <li> lovely set. great seller. now I just have to learn how to use them</li>
    <li> These brushes work great! They are perfect for makeup application. I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes! Love them. They are very soft. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Better than what I expected !</li>
    <li> Great set for a great price</li>
    <li> I just got this set of brushes  ,believe me they very soft and high quality product. I read all negative comments before I bought it, they tell about a smell. . Actually it&#x27;s normal smell of new close products, nothing new in the smell. I really like them very much, also I can put them inside my handbags very convenient.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought these based largely on price, although I still wanted decent brushes.  They are a bit smaller in size than I expected and I&#x27;m not a fan of the kabuki brush, but otherwise I think they&#x27;ll do just fine for a while. I was hoping that one of the powder brushes would be large and fluffy, but I&#x27;ll have to find that elsewhere.  They are definitely not &amp;#34;professional,&amp;#34; although neither am I and they work just fine for me.  Not overwhelmingly awesome, but not bad either.  They aren&#x27;t shedding, they are easy to wash, and they get the makeup from the pan onto my face. I&#x27;m really happy that I didn&#x27;t have to spend $80 on new makeup brushes, I think this set is a good value.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re soft, durable and a GREAT value! They&#x27;re every bit as good as some high-end brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I recommend them for people looking for great quality at a great price.</li>
    <li> Just wish they were labeled. No shedding otherwise good brushes. Happy.</li>
    <li> They are great! Paying more money would be insane when you can get these and have that flawless finish!! LOVE them and enjoy putting on my make up everyday!</li>
    <li> I love them they very good  quality product. The product is better for a person who knows how to use each brush they are not  labeled for each purpose.</li>
    <li> Excellent experience!</li>
    <li> Super soft I loved it</li>
    <li> Awesome buy.  Less shedding than my urban decay brush.</li>
    <li> Wow these brushes were super soft on my skin!! Best brushes ever I dont know they sell it for so cheap!!!!</li>
    <li> I am an independent distributor with SeneGence cosmetics &amp; have purchased MANY different brushes &amp; sets!  This set of brushes is by far one of the BEST I have ever purchased!!!  I love the fact that it contains more than one &#x27;stippling&#x27; brush!  The bristles are very soft, easy to use allowing for great coverage &amp; a smooth finish!!!  i have placed several orders for them &amp; would certainly recommend them!!!  I give them an A+!!!!!    Please feel free to view my page @ [...]. You will see some beautiful makeovers using this brush set!!!!</li>
    <li> I was going to buy a single brush that cost more than this entire set and looked very similar, but then I stumbled across this set. I took a chance and ordered the set and WOW! I expected maybe loose bristles coming out all over my face being so cheap, but to my surprise, that has NOT been the case with any of the brushes I&#x27;ve used thus far. They&#x27;re SO cute, appear to be great quality, and are soft and wonderful for applying powder foundation, blush, or whatever you need really. I highly recommend as this is a fantastic Amazon deal. I love Amazon and this product! :)</li>
    <li> i like the brush b/c they are soft.  i use it every day for mineral foundation.  however, the smell was so strong and so i had to wash them before using. other than the smell, the bristles are soft and works just great.</li>
    <li> Soo i was planing to wwatch them because it had a wierd smell  i watch the highlighter brush and it stared to fall little👎 hairs im so disapointed</li>
    <li> The price is amazing for these brushes!!The lightweight bamboo handles feel good in the hand, but the bristles are packed tightly and do not shed. They feel really soft and are nice on the face. There is such a great variety, there are face brushes for powders, liquid foundation, mineral makeup, bronzer as well as eye brushes for blending and smudging eye shadow and applying eyeliner or eyebrow products. Just amazing for the price. As with ALL my makeup brushes I wash with a mild soap before using and let air dry over the edge of my counter. I have several expensive brushes and I find myself reaching for these most over my other brushes. I also have bought a few as gifts for my mom &amp; friends because they are just so amazing and feel a lot more expensive than they are. They come packaged in a linen bag &amp; each brush has an individual wrapper.</li>
    <li> These are good short term brushes. The handles fall off though :/</li>
    <li> I was so surprised by the quality of these brushes!!!!! The brushes are VERY soft and super dense (like, i&#x27;m talking high end brush status dense). I have washed them a few times and I haven&#x27;t had much(if any) fall out. I have been using all of these brushes daily, to be honest. They lay product on the skin beautifully. The brushes are not labeled, but I feel like it would be very easy to google it if you&#x27;re unsure of what they&#x27;re for. They do also come with the carrying bag.&lt;br /&gt;The handles are very sturdy and look just like the picture. They are easy to clean and really pick up a good amount of product. I have only had these for a few weeks, but I can imagine that these will last for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;***If you are a makeup enthusiast, or even fairly new to makeup, these brushes would for sure be a good purchase. I would put these in the same category as Morphe brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with my own money and of my own volition. My review is honest and unbiased. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Not the best quality brushes. Hairs come out all the time</li>
    <li> Sturdy, firm bristles that don&#x27;t fall apart. Perfect for mineral makeup!</li>
    <li> Great value, quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Too many small brushes. Not what I need</li>
    <li> Gave them to my daughter for Christmas,,,she really likes them..</li>
    <li> These brushes are okay for when you are just starting to do make up. I cant complain for the price and shipping was pretty fast however, I would just go for the ELF studio brushes or even the brushes from ELF&#x27;s regular line, they are pretty cheap as well but they help apply eyeshadow much easier with the DragonPad I didn&#x27;t feel it picked up as much product and the brushes werent as easy to work with.</li>
    <li> The brushes work like a charm and got here on time</li>
    <li> Everything arrived on time. I haven&#x27;t used the product yet because I want to wash and clean them first however, the brushed are insanely soft. They are as expected from the pictures and descriptions. They come in the little sack individually wrapped. The only thing I&#x27;m not pleased with is that they all reak of plastic but I&#x27;m sure after you wash and begin using them that will all fade away.</li>
    <li> its ok... one of the brushes broke already.....you get what you pay for....save your money and buy a a better brush set</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes! They are soft and easy to manage.  Can&#x27;t wait to play with all the different brushes!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping, Great Brushes/no shedding!</li>
    <li> Amazing brushes, when my other pack of these start getting old i will be buying these same ones again! Amazingly soft, nice bristles to keep the product on where it needs to be, and I just really love them. Very nice for the price, feel like professional! Recommended to anyone who wants good makeup brushes on a budget. They also came faster then they said, so don&#x27;t let the shipping time scare you.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Better than mac brushes</li>
    <li> Very happy with these brushes. So soft and each one is the perfect softness or more firm for what that specific brush is intended for. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I was worried about buying these brushes because of the price, they are so soft. Great quality, I would definitely recommend these to a friend! Happy happy customer!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. This isn&#x27;t too bad though. Have had them for about a year now and some are coming apart.</li>
    <li> Well made. Soft. Fast shipping. Great price.</li>
    <li> Enjoying these! Not a &#x27;Name Brand&amp;#34;person per se, but I do feel that some products are worth  paying more. These are very cool, and I will buy them as gifts for loved ones. they have a smell of being sanitized or disinfected. I appreciate that! just clean them well, and they&#x27;re good to go. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist, not a MUA, but in my opinion these are great.</li>
    <li> It felt like an eternity waiting for these to arrive but now that they are finally here I am so ecstatic. I have been using these brushes for about a week and they&#x27;re so soft. The brush doesn&#x27;t fall apart like ones I&#x27;ve had before! Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Just as ordered, love them.</li>
    <li> Was exactly like the picture, very soft bristles on brushes! Very happy with my purchase!! 😁😍👯👸❤👍👌</li>
    <li> The quality of the wood could be better, when I go to apply brushes I can feel the wood detaching from the bush.. The quality of the brushes is amazing though!</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes.... Gave to sister for gift, she loved them.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Soft&lt;br /&gt;Good for eye makeup&lt;br /&gt;Good packaging&lt;br /&gt;Shipping as expected&lt;br /&gt;Nice varieties&lt;br /&gt;No shedding (at least not yet)&lt;br /&gt;Good starter kit&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy plastic part&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smell like paint&lt;br /&gt;2 similar brush just different in size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product and would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so soft and just perfect. I thought I would always have to pay more to get more but these are absolutely the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Recieved these yesterday and I love them! They are so soft on the skin, the wood is really nice and the cloth bag is perfect for my purse size not too big so I Love it and I have no complaints yet! Thanks for such a quick shipment.</li>
    <li> fantastic!  This compare closely to my smashbox brushes.  If you need brushes don&#x27;t hesitate order it, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.  You can&#x27;t beat their price too!!  so hurry before its dissappears.</li>
    <li> surprisingly, these are amazing!  So soft and with almost no shedding.  I have MAC brushes and Sephora brushes and so far I like these better.  Crazy.</li>
    <li> OKAY FOR THE PRICE...GREAT IF YOU&#x27;RE JUST TRYING TO GET INTO THE MAKEUP THING!</li>
    <li> The brushes are smaller than the photo - somewhat cheap looking. Brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome they are soft and came way earlier than was expected. I would do it all again.</li>
    <li> Love them quality was better than expected ! Even bought a second set for my mom !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great for the price.. love it</li>
    <li> Some of the bristles are shedding...but overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> They are so soft and they blend my makeup smoothly on my face!  Love them!!</li>
</ol>
