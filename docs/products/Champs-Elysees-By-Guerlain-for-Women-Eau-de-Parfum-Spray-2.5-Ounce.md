      <li>Haven&#x27;t had any of this perfume for many years.  </li>
      <li>I have been trying to buy  Champs Elysees eau de parfum in my area and have not been able to find It anywhere.</li>
      <li>Love it and so do all my friends.  </li>
      <li>It is still one of my favorites and I loved finding it at Fragrance.net at a reasonable price and sealed in authentic package.  </li>
      <li>This is a light fragrance and one that is classic and gets great compliments.</li>
      <li>Order arrived as expected and product is perfect.</li>
      <li>so glad that i can still find it here - keep those bottles out of the light.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t like strong perfumes.  </li>
      <li>Spray it lightly</li>
      <li>I am so very happy I can buy a few bottles of this fragrance as it is one of my favorites.</li>

      <li>I hope it is not discontinued because it has a beautiful fragrance and stays with me all day long!</li>
      <li>Thanks for  putting it online so all can enjoy it.</li>
      <li>The last time I was able to buy it in the U.S. was in the early 2000&#x27;s, when it was still available at the PX.  </li>
      <li>It smelled exactly like Chanel #5, so overpowering, so old-lady-ish</li>
      <li>Have used it for several years...receive compliments often and truly enjoy wearing it!</li>
      <li>Classy but elegant for any young lady.</li>
      <li>This is such a wonderful fragrance and so very hard to find in our dept. stores.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This Champs Elysees fragrance smelled very much diluted, not at all like my old one.</li>
      <li>A classic perfume.</li>
      <li>Is too high</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been my new signature scent.  </li>
      <li>, I decided to get a bigger bottle and higher concentration.</li>
      <li>I only purchased it from Amazon as previous shop can&#x27;t seem to get it anymore &amp; hasn&#x27;t been able to for 6 months.</li>
      <li>Clean with a slight floral touch, it endures throughout a 12 hour day.  </li>
      <li>soft scent</li>
      <li>It is OLD</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t available in US in that format for a few years.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell, it smell like it should be use by my 90 year old grandma.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing Champs for years, I never grow tired of the compliments I receive from people saying how nice I smell and asking what is that you&#x27;re wearing?</li>
      <li>I prefer the old school classic floral French parfumes and colognes.</li>
      <li>I bought eau de toilette first, the same smell but different concentration.</li>
      <li>They were quick to ship in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But I read enough reviews on this perfume and specifically on eau de parfum concentration to know that it should smell ok, fruity and flowery but a little longer lasting.  </li>
      <li>I especially like the white florals &amp; gentle musk notes.</li>
      <li>I still had some of my old perfume left when I ordered this.</li>
      <li>and it is not very long lasting</li>

<li> Champs Elysees by Guerlain Eau de Parfum is very hard to find.  </li>
<li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
<li> I wish there was a way for me to do something about it, because now  that I opened it I am stuck with a big bottle of bad perfume and don&#x27;t know what to do:(</li>
<li> and I am SO angry</li>
<li> I wish it was sold in every department store because it has become so difficult to find.</li>

    <li> Champs Elysees by Guerlain Eau de Parfum is very hard to find.  I hope it is not discontinued because it has a beautiful fragrance and stays with me all day long!</li>
    <li> Champs Elysees is my wife&#x27;s preferred fragrance. The nearest stocking store is Neiman Marcus in Dallas--40 miles away. Amazon saves us an 80-mile trip to a crowded mall, and the price is substantially lower! Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes sweet and ideal for any ocasion.</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume since it came out and love it. I have tried other perfumes, but keep coming back to this one. I get lots of compliments and people often say its my signature fragrance. It is a light fragrance and smells great!!</li>
    <li> A welcomed  present to the overjoyed receivers</li>
    <li> I still had some of my old perfume left when I ordered this. This Champs Elysees fragrance smelled very much diluted, not at all like my old one. I checked carefully - both were Eau de Perfume. Not happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great scent, simply love it.</li>
    <li> I am so so disappointed! It is OLD and I am SO angry&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE- I spoke to Amazon and they were AWESOME! They replaced it and gave me a $10 credit for the inconvenience!! I hope people don&#x27;t abuse how kind they are.  I make as many purchases on here as I can and I am absolutely Thrilled that they were immediately kind and helpful! I love Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Will order for Christmas</li>
    <li> This eau de parfum is a great value. I have been trying to buy  Champs Elysees eau de parfum in my area and have not been able to find It anywhere. I am so very happy I can buy a few bottles of this fragrance as it is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> The fragrance from this product is not even close to what I have been using for years but decided to keep it as my daughter seems to think it is. I&#x27;ve tried puttin it on my skin, clothes &amp; even tissue + paper towel &amp; it&#x27;s not even close to what I wanted. I even let it sit for several days &amp; then tried it again but it still didn&#x27;t smell like previous bottles which by the way I didn&#x27;t get from Amazon but a specialty fragrance shop. I only purchased it from Amazon as previous shop can&#x27;t seem to get it anymore &amp; hasn&#x27;t been able to for 6 months. Definitely WOULD NOT order this from Amazon again! Thank goodness I have found a place to order it but in smaller oz bottles.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Champs for years, I never grow tired of the compliments I receive from people saying how nice I smell and asking what is that you&#x27;re wearing?</li>
    <li> This parfum is a VERY SOPHISTICATED perfume. It leaves behind a soft scent. I wish it was sold in every department store because it has become so difficult to find. Been my favorite since 1998!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t buy this in stores anymore!  My favorite!</li>
    <li> soft scent&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like strong perfumes.  They give me a headache</li>
    <li> The Champs élysées is just as intoxicating a fragrance as I remember.  The last time I was able to buy it in the U.S. was in the early 2000&#x27;s, when it was still available at the PX.  I have missed it greatly and am so glad to get some again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and perfectly packed, wife loves this scent and I was so happy to get it for her</li>
    <li> I bought eau de toilette first, the same smell but different concentration. That one smelled wonderful-fresh, fruity, floral, but because it was only 1oz and it is not very long lasting, I decided to get a bigger bottle and higher concentration. The shipment was amazing I got it in like a day and a half. But I almost cried when I opened it and made a spritz. It smelled exactly like Chanel #5, so overpowering, so old-lady-ish and it gave me a migraine at once. It was my worst experience buying perfume ever. But I read enough reviews on this perfume and specifically on eau de parfum concentration to know that it should smell ok, fruity and flowery but a little longer lasting.  Not like this. I wish there was a way for me to do something about it, because now  that I opened it I am stuck with a big bottle of bad perfume and don&#x27;t know what to do:(</li>
    <li> Love it and so do all my friends.  Have had a lot of compliments even from strangers.Light</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift. Recipient loved it!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for a long time.  It is very pleasant and not overpowering.  I often have people ask what I am wearing, and one friend ordered it for herself.  It is my very favorite!</li>
    <li> I bought this wonderful perfume as a gift and the recipient absolutely loved it. I would happily purchase it again!!!</li>
    <li> she loved it, and that&#x27;s huge! Six stars</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this parfume for more than 20 years, Iove it ! I used to pay 3 times more at Bergdorf !!!</li>
    <li> A got this for my mother as this is a her favorite as a part of a gift basket. She could not be happier so I could not be happier. This product smells great. Classy but elegant for any young lady.</li>
    <li> Great service for a product that I use and like.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. I bought it as a gift and my mom is so happy with it!!! 100% recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, it smell like it should be use by my 90 year old grandma. And now I&#x27;m force to keep a parfum that I won&#x27;t use, becuase you can&#x27;t return it back to amazon, from which I purchase it from. My advice to anyone go to the mall and buy your parfum, especially when u force to keep a $53.00 and a $75.00 parfum. My lost Total: 125.00 + dollars go down the drain during this hard period of our life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gaynor Alexis</li>
    <li> Wish it was still in stores! A hummingbird mistook me for a flower in the mountains while wearing this. He buzzed around me bewildered and then flitted off. If that&#x27;s not good advertising I don&#x27;t know what is!!</li>
    <li> I bought Champs Elysees in Paris in 1999 in the edp format and loved it.  It is a lovely combination of rose, mimosa and almond.....rosey but not powdery and it lasts. It wasn&#x27;t available in US in that format for a few years.  It is still one of my favorites and I loved finding it at Fragrance.net at a reasonable price and sealed in authentic package.  They were quick to ship in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the fragrance and Fragrance.com.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a place where I could order what I consider to be one of my all-time favorite fragrances.  I could be standing on line to purchase something and BOTH men and women complement me on this fragrance.  Spray it lightly, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot at all and it will last a long while without overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years and still love it. I prefer the old school classic floral French parfumes and colognes.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful scent. unbelievable that it has been discontinued. have found nothing to replace it as yet. so glad that i can still find it here - keep those bottles out of the light.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful fragrance for the mature woman who expects the best from her parfum. I especially like the white florals &amp; gentle musk notes. Best for evening..</li>
    <li> My signature perfume. Have used it for several years...receive compliments often and truly enjoy wearing it!</li>
    <li> Champs Elysees is an exquisite perfume for everyday scents.  Clean with a slight floral touch, it endures throughout a 12 hour day.  Fast shipping. A++</li>
    <li> My wife loves this scent.  Oh, the scent  of a woman.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been my new signature scent.  I get a lot of complements from wearing it.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite scent, (mine as well). A classic perfume.</li>
    <li> It was a gift. Just what she asked for.</li>
    <li> This smells absolutely beautiful!  It came packaged very nice!</li>
