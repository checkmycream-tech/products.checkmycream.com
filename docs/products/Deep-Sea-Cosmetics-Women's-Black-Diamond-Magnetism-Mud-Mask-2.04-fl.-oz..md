      <li>I purchased this product today at a reputable mall kiosk by an aggressive salesperson for $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>I think its okay</li>
      <li>your face really feels great when you are through.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>As someone who has been involved in these home based businesses, I understand the aggressive nature of the salespeople because the businesses train you to be that way, and if you make your money back,pay for your training, overhead and advertisement and still come out with a worthwhile profit, this is the way to do it.</li>
      <li>and i have a lot more to go before I am out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best facial mask I&#x27;ve had in my life.</li>
      <li>The stuff smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, not chemically or anything and is refreshing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m questioning what is in this product and is it safe to use.  </li>
      <li>AND much more affordable through Amazon vendors than at the Malls</li>
      <li>and i fell in love with this product.</li>
      <li>All the products that were offered came to an original price of over $1300.00!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually very cool to see.  </li>
      <li>All of their products are amazing and the price you pay is totally worth it in the end.</li>
      <li>I am especially happy that I did not break down and buy this at the mall, but instead searched out a better deal.  </li>
      <li>tissues fall apart too easily).</li>
      <li>He gave me a lot of free stuff for buying one of the 350.00 sets.</li>
      <li>and I use chemical free creams</li>
      <li>If you enjoy taking time for yourself</li>
      <li>The magnet is very powerful.</li>
      <li>It is alot of fun!  </li>
      <li>Of Sheba- Shipping Original Products From Israel\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>This product is absolutely amazing and I am now completely hooked!</li>
      <li>I bought the authentic Dead Sea Cosmetics (DSC) mineral magnetic mud mask for my wife / mother-in-law at a mall kiosk in June and they loved it.  </li>
      <li>My 50 year old skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>I have found several home based business products (including my own ) here on Amazon for fractions of what they are listed for-</li>
      <li>But overall, I hope this product will make a difference with my skin because I think the idea of changing circulation with minerals and magnetic field is kind of interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I would use this product in the winter before going to bed.</li>
      <li>the price is right.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong magnetic pull &amp; is full of minerals so you only want to use this product once, maybe twice, per week.  </li>
      <li>and I first saw and bought the product at a Kiosk in a KY mall.  </li>
      <li>I first learned about this product when I was in the mall.</li>
      <li>Really, really works!</li>
      <li>I was first approached by a kiosk worker in the mall who wanted to sell me this for a &#x27;sale&#x27;  price of around $200.00.</li>
      <li>Is 100% recommended changes are from the first application.</li>
      <li>I first saw this product in the Mall.</li>
      <li>Buy online if interested.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to read all directions on what to do next.</li>
      <li>This product comes with a magnet to take off the mask, just wrap in tissue first.</li>
      <li>Do not feel scammed if you paid more at the Kiosk, this is NOT the same product...</li>
      <li>The minimum first order has to be 1,000 dollars.</li>
      <li>The magnet is so powerful that it won&#x27;t slide along the paper towel on your face very well.</li>
      <li>To use it properly, she explained to me to use it on a clean dry face, rub the product over your face in an upward motion, and then using the magnet (which is extremely strong) wrap the magnet in a paper towel (I have found it best to cover it at least twice</li>
      <li>The picture in Amazon is exactly the product my sister had gotten at a Kiosk at the mall (much cheaper</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of other products over the years, but These  products are by far superior.</li>
      <li>so I really want one</li>
      <li>I tried to wipe them off with paper towel, it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>most critically that the \\&quot;mineral stone\\&quot; it comes with doesn&#x27;t lift off the dried mask like the authentic DSC magnetic mud mask.  </li>
      <li>Just be careful with the magnet, if that stuff gets on it instead of the tissue you will never get it off :)</li>
      <li>I will pay off the card and not worry so much about it-</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t really touch your face anyway.</li>
      <li>And it works really well to remove impurities and leave your face moisturized.</li>
      <li>So I have two years worth of product that I will use because my skin is sensitive</li>
      <li>I really like the product,just don&#x27;t like  being taken advantage of.</li>
      <li>I am nearing the end of my first one and needed a new container.  </li>
      <li>They did a small area and it showed immediate results that lasted for many hours!</li>
      <li>and then you clean with Deep Sea Milk.</li>
      <li>I bought some deep sea items at a kiosk and they did not give me a full size products .</li>
      <li>So alternating the use of this product with another one, such as Aveda Facial Mask, can give you better results.</li>
      <li>DEEP SEA COSMETIC DEAD SEA BLACK DIAMOND - MAGNESTISM MUD MASK IS THE BEST EVER.</li>
      <li>Kind of hard to use and made my face feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>I know the guy probably knew exactly what everything costed to begin with and probably hates the business model and because he was going back to Israel was throwing caution to the wind because it really doesn&#x27;t matter he is leaving anyway.</li>
      <li>After you remove the mud from your face, it leaves behind a moisturizer, it feels so good on the skin.</li>
      <li>100% Natural!</li>
      <li>Just wanted to let everyone know that many of the kiosks selling this item are ripoffs and that you are not able to return anything.</li>
      <li>So you can imagine when I saw this for $70 (i.e., the exact same jar as in the Amazon photo)</li>
      <li>Still the price online was no where near that!  </li>
      <li>as a &amp;#34;baby boomer&amp;#34;, use after a mud mask to remove the dead cells - then this fabulous mask; leave residue overnight or all day ...</li>
      <li>skin is so soft and glowing.  </li>
      <li>So far, I used it once</li>
      <li>With that said, it should last over a year, making it very affordable when averaged out.  </li>
      <li>(HINT:  when removing use paper towels or soft rag wrapped around the magnet ...</li>
      <li>The associate was very helpful in explaining how to use it properly.  </li>
      <li>had a bit of buyer&#x27;s remorse thinking what I had spent till I tried the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and if I had paid for every single item individually (on the site) for the special prices listed on the site, I would have paid almost 800 dollars.</li>
      <li>Once you remove the magnet from the kleenex, which is not an easy task , then it goes back to looking like a black cream.</li>
      <li>Suddenly everything was priced in half and 5 nail buffer kits for free.</li>
      <li>My husband loves my very soft skin and I never told him that I started doing anything different!!  </li>
      <li>No other misturizer needed overnight.</li>
      <li>( for just the mask)  Checked it out online the next day - imagine my relief that we did not buy it when the price online was no where near the 495.00 price.</li>
      <li>I actually had to slide the magnet directly on the skin to remove the mask, which gave the problem of cleaning the magnet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Is this an actual deep sea cosmetic product???because I have purchased the same item at a mall for 150$$ an if so I really want one</li>
    <li> I am nearing the end of my first one and needed a new container.  I have bad red-head skin with lots of red and I break out on my cheekbones.  As soon as that starts back I use this product and the redness and breakout is gone overnight!  Just be careful with the magnet, if that stuff gets on it instead of the tissue you will never get it off :)</li>
    <li> I first learned about this product when I was in the mall. It seemed to make my complexion calmer because I have rosecea on my face. Well, the demo in the mall motivated me to get one online. So far, I used it once and it did seem to even my facial complaxion a little bit and I am looking forward to trying it again. I don&#x27;t know how often you are supposed to use it. One problem though, the reason I give a \\&quot;three star\\&quot; rating is that the magnet bar that came with it is so powerful that it was very difficult to remove all the tiny magnetites in the mask (mud) that got stuck on the magnet. I tried to wipe them off with paper towel, it didn&#x27;t work very well. I tried to rinse them off with water, and of course that didn&#x27;t work at all. The magnet is so powerful that it won&#x27;t slide along the paper towel on your face very well. As a result, it was not very effective in removing the mask from your face by using the magnet over the paper towel. I actually had to slide the magnet directly on the skin to remove the mask, which gave the problem of cleaning the magnet. But overall, I hope this product will make a difference with my skin because I think the idea of changing circulation with minerals and magnetic field is kind of interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I would use this product in the winter before going to bed. It leaves your face oily which is fine with me because I have thin, dry facial skin. No other misturizer needed overnight. However, I do not see any long-term improvement on my skin. The complexion-calming effect is short-lived like other products and becomes unnoticeable after each use as the time goes on. So alternating the use of this product with another one, such as Aveda Facial Mask, can give you better results.</li>
    <li> This product comes with a magnet to take off the mask, just wrap in tissue first. I was unaware of this at first, and used the magnet with out tissue, i could hardly get the mud off. After you remove the mud from your face, it leaves behind a moisturizer, it feels so good on the skin. Just make sure to read all directions on what to do next. I have noticed improvement in my skin, it seems to be softer, and i have even noticed some dark spots fading, not saying this alone is doing it, because i also use three other DSC products, i am sold on these products.</li>
    <li> Bought this product at the mall kiosk.  The associate was very helpful in explaining how to use it properly.  It has a strong magnetic pull &amp; is full of minerals so you only want to use this product once, maybe twice, per week.  With that said, it should last over a year, making it very affordable when averaged out.  To use it properly, she explained to me to use it on a clean dry face, rub the product over your face in an upward motion, and then using the magnet (which is extremely strong) wrap the magnet in a paper towel (I have found it best to cover it at least twice otherwise you can&#x27;t get the product off the magnet).  When using the magnet, you only want to barely glide it over your skin, do not press down.  It will lift the product off and it will adhere to the magnet.  It&#x27;s actually very cool to see.  Do NOT wash your face is what she told me.  You want to leave the minerals on your face.  You can then use the milk cleanser.  It will remove any extra dirt from your skin but leave the minerals behind.   I have noticed a dramatic improvement in my complexion since using this product.  Don&#x27;t think I will be using anything else now that I&#x27;ve found this brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a mall kiosk.  I love the product!  It is a lot cheaper on line... lesson learned.  You must cover the magnet with a paper towel and double it over.  Since I have started using a few of their products, people HAVE noticed.  My husband loves my very soft skin and I never told him that I started doing anything different!!  I love the feel of my face after I use this!</li>
    <li> I have to say. I was introduced to this in florida and i fell in love with this product. I have had my product for about 7 months now and she told me it would last for a year and i have a lot more to go before I am out. I would recomend this product along with all the Deep Sea Cosmetics to every female. All of their products are amazing and the price you pay is totally worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best facial mask I&#x27;ve had in my life. Is 100% recommended changes are from the first application.It is advisable to use a moisturizer</li>
    <li> Bought Black Diamond Magnetism Mud Mask at mall kiosk.  Paid approx $200.00. I really like the product,just don&#x27;t like  being taken advantage of. Buy online if interested.</li>
    <li> This mud is very interesting. I am amazed at how it works and I  have never before used anything that was magnetic. It is a little hard to put on, that may just be me, but after you do you leave it on for about 7 minutes and then take it off with a kleenex wrapped around a magnet. It is amazing. You can not use water only a magnet and don&#x27;t let the magnet be exposed because you will never remove the particles from the magnet, they must stay on the kleenex. Once you remove the magnet from the kleenex, which is not an easy task , then it goes back to looking like a black cream. Don&#x27;t get the particles on your hands, they can&#x27;t be washed off, only removed with the magnet. That having been said, when the magnetic particles are removed, there is a oil left on your face to be rubbed in and then you clean with Deep Sea Milk. It is fascinating to remove the mud. your face really feels great when you are through.&lt;br /&gt;This all takes a little time, but your skin does glow when you are finished. If you enjoy taking time for yourself you would probably like this product.</li>
    <li> I first saw this product in the Mall. They did a small area and it showed immediate results that lasted for many hours! I&#x27;ve used lots of other products over the years, but These  products are by far superior. AND much more affordable through Amazon vendors than at the Malls</li>
    <li> Just wanted to let everyone know that many of the kiosks selling this item are ripoffs and that you are not able to return anything. I bought some deep sea items at a kiosk and they did not give me a full size products . I was not able to return them. Never buy anything from a kiosk. They are ripoff artists. They will hand you a bag and there will be cosmetics in it, but they may not be the same size as the cosmetics they showed you.</li>
    <li> Had a great sales pitch at he mall, got us really interested.  Was all set to make a purchase until we were told it was $495.00!!!! ( for just the mask)  Checked it out online the next day - imagine my relief that we did not buy it when the price online was no where near the 495.00 price. All the products that were offered came to an original price of over $1300.00!  Suddenly everything was priced in half and 5 nail buffer kits for free. Still the price was over $600.00.  Still the price online was no where near that!  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Just love it ... as a &amp;#34;baby boomer&amp;#34;, use after a mud mask to remove the dead cells - then this fabulous mask; leave residue overnight or all day ... skin is so soft and glowing.  (HINT:  when removing use paper towels or soft rag wrapped around the magnet ... tissues fall apart too easily).</li>
    <li> DEEP SEA COSMETIC DEAD SEA BLACK DIAMOND - MAGNESTISM MUD MASK IS THE BEST EVER. I ONLY WISH THAT IT WAS LESS EXSPENSIVE AND DID NOT COST AS MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REBECCA W. REYES</li>

We did not buy the \\&quot;magnetic mud\\&quot; as it was too expensive.  Then we found it on Amazon at 1/4th the price and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is thrilled with the purchase.  The product delivered everything that it promised.  I told my daughter in Roswell Ga about it and she bought it.  She is also very happy as the product delivered everthing it promised.</li>
    <li> Yes it is sickening when we find these things on Amazon for a fortune less then what we paid, however, these products on the companies website are the same price that they sell them for at the mall kiosks. I looked at the company&#x27;s website and apparently they are created for home based business-such as Shaklee or Avon (except on a more expensive scale). The minimum first order has to be 1,000 dollars. As someone who has been involved in these home based businesses, I understand the aggressive nature of the salespeople because the businesses train you to be that way, and if you make your money back,pay for your training, overhead and advertisement and still come out with a worthwhile profit, this is the way to do it. This is why I am not a big leader in Avon, I am not aggressive-and my products list prices are not near what DSC are. That being said the price difference does not cause me to be question the ingredients or the value of the product. I have found several home based business products (including my own ) here on Amazon for fractions of what they are listed for-it just means that someone got into a business-hated the business model-and they are selling the product for what they paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;  Yesterday I put a big bill on my credit card at one of these Kiosks. The guy there was leaving the company and said I was his last customer. He gave me a lot of free stuff for buying one of the 350.00 sets. I went home and got on their site and if I had paid for every single item individually (on the site) for the special prices listed on the site, I would have paid almost 800 dollars. I know the guy probably knew exactly what everything costed to begin with and probably hates the business model and because he was going back to Israel was throwing caution to the wind because it really doesn&#x27;t matter he is leaving anyway. So I have two years worth of product that I will use because my skin is sensitive and I use chemical free creams and I only have to use minusculeamounts of DSC, plus the black diamond mask is only to be used once a week. I will pay off the card and not worry so much about it-it is not the worst deal I ever made by a long shot.</li>
    <li> Excellent service and good product</li>
    <li> I have always dodged the aggressive sales people at the mall. My sister got bushwhacked and bought just about everything!.  She gave me the mask as a gift and I have gone from skeptic to fan.  My 50 year old skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I used the black diamond magnetism mask for the first time this morning.  I cannot believe how soft and even my skin looks after only one use.  I am especially happy that I did not break down and buy this at the mall, but instead searched out a better deal.  This product is absolutely amazing and I am now completely hooked!</li>
    <li> I was first approached by a kiosk worker in the mall who wanted to sell me this for a &#x27;sale&#x27;  price of around $200.00. Of course I thought I&#x27;d Google it just to see what the online prices were.  I had no idea there&#x27;d be such a drastic difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is magnetic. You remove it with a paper towel wrapped around the included magnet. And it works really well to remove impurities and leave your face moisturized. Use at night so the moisture can soak into your skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It was received within a few days after ordering it.</li>
    <li> Bought this at the mall. Yes it is cheaper online but you can also haggle down the mall sellers to even less than online price. Don&#x27;t name the price just keep hedging.&lt;br /&gt;I had a bit of buyer&#x27;s remorse thinking what I had spent till I tried the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea. Blotchy reddened areas on my nose and cheeks especially that are difficult to cover up even with make-up.&lt;br /&gt;Just one use of this mask and my skin was soft and less blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT use just a facial tissue to remove this product!! The magnet is very powerful. The iron particles are heavier than the tissue and it&#x27;s difficult to remove the shredding paper and firmly attached iron bits. Use a sturdy paper towel. You don&#x27;t really touch your face anyway. It&#x27;s just a deposit surface for the iron.</li>
    <li> Well I am updating my review, tried out the product and totally loved it.  Seems like DEEP SEA has been replaced by DEAD SEA.  Good results afTer using it and the price is right.  Although what I indicated about the product info is correct the product is totally awesome!  So from 1 pt I give it a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister purchased the DEEP SEA COSMETICS magnetic mud mask, $180 value...She bought it at a Mall Kiosk, she loved it and she had me try it out. I loved it! Really, really works! So as a gift (a very expensive one at that) she found it on AMAZON and got it as a gift for me....I waited 4 weeks for it to arrive from Israel. It arrived and what I got was AROMA \\&quot;Dead\\&quot; Sea Royal Diamond Quantum Energy Mask. The picture in Amazon is exactly the product my sister had gotten at a Kiosk at the mall (much cheaper or so we thought) but what arrived is nothing like the picture and it is called Aroma. Buyer beware. Have not tried out the product, don&#x27;t know if I will or maybe I will just try to return it.. This product still costs a lot of money; so those of you that found it more expensive at the mall, what is being shipped from this site is not the same thing you got at the Kiosk at the mall. Do not feel scammed if you paid more at the Kiosk, this is NOT the same product...I may be the one getting scammed here.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY this product if what you are looking for is the Deep Sea Cosmetic, it is not the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I got it from \\&quot;Queen Of Sheba- Shipping Original Products From Israel\\&quot;.  The other shippers may be the correct ones but this one is not shipping DEEP SEA COSMETICS.  BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this product.  It is alot of fun!  You need to keep the magnet covered well with a paper towel.  I double it around the magnet.  If the product gets on the magnet it is hard to remove. I can tell a difference in my skin since using the magnetism mud mask.</li>
    <li> Kind of hard to use and made my face feel greasy.  I think its okay but not sure I would buy it again as it has so much residue and if you leave it on it would get all over your pillow case.  Product is very hard to get off the magnet.</li>
    <li> I use this about once a month and it is great. Im not sure if it actually tones but my skin looks healthier for about a week after using it and feels smoother. The stuff smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, not chemically or anything and is refreshing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product today at a reputable mall kiosk by an aggressive salesperson for $200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can only imagine how foolish I felt when I came home and found it on-line for $39.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m questioning what is in this product and is it safe to use.  The company has lost all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;credibility with me.</li>
    <li> I bought the authentic Dead Sea Cosmetics (DSC) mineral magnetic mud mask for my wife / mother-in-law at a mall kiosk in June and they loved it.  So you can imagine when I saw this for $70 (i.e., the exact same jar as in the Amazon photo) I jumped on the greatly discounted price and bought TWO jars.&lt;br /&gt;However, when the package arrive (via international post from Israel there was NO DSC product inside....instead only a brown generic box called \\&quot;AROMA DEAD SEA DIAMOND Quantum Energy Mask.\\&quot;  My MIL tried it today and said it&#x27;s totally different....most critically that the \\&quot;mineral stone\\&quot; it comes with doesn&#x27;t lift off the dried mask like the authentic DSC magnetic mud mask.  BUYER BEWARe...I think I was had !</li>
    <li> Perfect travel carry-on, plenty of pockets and space, lightweight and not too large for overhead storage aboard almost every airplane</li>
