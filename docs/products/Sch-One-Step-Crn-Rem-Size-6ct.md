### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>dr scholl&#x27;s corn remover worked perfectly, my corn has disappeared, and that with 3 dr. scholl&#x27;s  band aids.</li>
      <li>This seemed to work best, but:</li>
      <li>I hope this review helps, and good luck!</li>
      <li>great stuff for my husband</li>
      <li>Worked great removed my corn in 2 days.</li>
      <li>worked well - good delivery</li>
      <li>I just would like to see the healing process to give it good reviews.</li>
      <li>my skin heals perfect and makes a normal toe again.</li>
      <li>I am confident I could do it quicker now if I had to.</li>
      <li>Made my toe more sore than the corn was.</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>Then out of desperation, I decided to try Dr. Scholl&#x27;s one step, even though I had been told by many that they would not work.</li>
      <li>I found you can vary that time a bit, and I ended up using most for three days.</li>
      <li>I had the kind of corns that are persistent, and do not go away when you remove the original cause.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, because it fells so easily.</li>
      <li>But I strongly expect that I will not have to.</li>
      <li>Very easy to put on, then I place a large, water proof band aid on top of it.</li>
      <li>but these do peel huge circular chunks out at a time.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>so far so good hope</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth it!</li>
      <li>Caveat: Be mindful and clean about using this medicine.</li>
      <li>This product is excellent, the pain left after first application, by second application</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a powerful tool.</li>
      <li>Have corn on end of toe, got way too wide and into the good skin.</li>
      <li>I started in again, and the next time I stopped, I was sure.</li>
      <li>I first started using this and after the first application, i saw nothing.</li>
      <li>I used the entire pack on one area and all it did was fry circles into the surrounding healthy parts of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I also didn&#x27;t wear the shoes that caused the corn in the first place during using this.</li>
      <li>And sure enough, the corn was healed.</li>
      <li>I used this as instructed on my top toe for my callus/corn and now my top layer of my skin is raw and bleeding!</li>
      <li>Super amazingly affective, Don&#x27;t get your hopes up on only needing two treatments though, these band aids are tiny.</li>
      <li>They are too small and lacks good adhesive properties.</li>
      <li>it seems to have worked, lets see if it doesnt become large again</li>
      <li>The water just seemed to help the medicine, if not in too large amounts.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think anyone but the user can really decide that.</li>
      <li>Worked very well and haven&#x27;t had problems since I removed the corn.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>I like them because they go on like a band-aid &amp; they stay in place better than the round discs.</li>
      <li>I had learned to live with them.</li>
      <li>Then what I did was cut a little of my corn with a razor, then I applied 2 more times, both 48hr intervals, and BOOM, the corn turned white and just basically fell off.</li>
      <li>Figure out what you&#x27;re working with and use the one steps to get rid of the corns completely.</li>
      <li>the corn was completely gone, peeled off immediately.  </li>
      <li>Just what the doctor ordered works well arrived early</li>
      <li>It says to use a new one after two days, but it can barely stay for one day.</li>
      <li>If your goal is complete healing of the corn, back to a toe that looks and feels like it never had a corn, then this is the product to do it.</li>
      <li>Mine took a few months, partly while I just learned the right things to do.</li>
      <li>No pain beside a little stinging within the first 2 hours of application.</li>
      <li>I dont really see any results other than the white spot on my toe which I hope goes away in time.</li>
      <li>One: the tape sticks pretty firmly to its cover when you try to peel it off before using it.</li>
      <li>Four: Don&#x27;t soak the toe, but on the other hand, taking normal showers with the corn remover on seemed actually helpful.</li>
      <li>My baby toe is now bright red and looks painful but its not.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are my favorites. Very easy to put on, then I place a large, water proof band aid on top of it. That way I can leave it on for 2 or 3 days without it coming off in the shower or from friction when I walk.</li>
    <li> I had corns for over 15 years, never thought they would go away. These were deep persistent corns, with a core that goes deep into the skin. I was told by people who had tried them that Dr. Scholl&#x27;s corn removers would not work. Those people were wrong. I had the kind of corns that are persistent, and do not go away when you remove the original cause. Very painful at times. I had learned to live with them. Then out of desperation, I decided to try Dr. Scholl&#x27;s one step, even though I had been told by many that they would not work. Well, they work! If you have long standing (no pun intended)corns, they may take longer, that&#x27;s all. Figure out what you&#x27;re working with and use the one steps to get rid of the corns completely. Mine took a few months, partly while I just learned the right things to do. I am confident I could do it quicker now if I had to. But I strongly expect that I will not have to. If your goal is complete healing of the corn, back to a toe that looks and feels like it never had a corn, then this is the product to do it. A few months to get rid of a painful issue that would last a lifetime left untreated? Absolutely worth it! Caveat: Be mindful and clean about using this medicine. It&#x27;s a powerful tool. Respect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to write about the things I wish I&#x27;d known before I started. One: the tape sticks pretty firmly to its cover when you try to peel it off before using it. No problem. Use a fingertip on the corner of the pad to help separate it from the storage cover. Two: It says use two days each pad. I found you can vary that time a bit, and I ended up using most for three days. When this time was up, I found I could cut away dead skin, take a shower, and apply another bandage. This seemed to work best, but: Three: The corn will keep changing as you use this product, and your goal is to know how long to go on, and when to stop. I don&#x27;t think anyone but the user can really decide that. I stopped once, which turned out to be early, and knew within a few days that the corn was not healed yet. I started in again, and the next time I stopped, I was sure. And sure enough, the corn was healed. Four: Don&#x27;t soak the toe, but on the other hand, taking normal showers with the corn remover on seemed actually helpful. The water just seemed to help the medicine, if not in too large amounts. I think if you soaked your foot as you might in a bath, however, the medicine would wash away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if I&#x27;d known these things before I started the corn would have gone away quicker. I hope this review helps, and good luck!</li>
    <li> dr scholl&#x27;s corn remover worked perfectly, my corn has disappeared, and that with 3 dr. scholl&#x27;s  band aids.</li>
    <li> Super amazingly affective, Don&#x27;t get your hopes up on only needing two treatments though, these band aids are tiny. I am still in the process of removing but these do peel huge circular chunks out at a time.</li>
    <li> If I could give this a Zero Star. I would. I used this as instructed on my top toe for my callus/corn and now my top layer of my skin is raw and bleeding! DON&#x27;T USE IT! I regret it !!!!!</li>
    <li> great stuff for my husband</li>
    <li> Worked very well and haven&#x27;t had problems since I removed the corn. Took only one!</li>
    <li> Did not take out the corn, I am searching for other product to purchase.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin darker and worse. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Used these to remove a Callus on both pinkey toes and literally within two application on each foot (you get 6 strips in the box) the calluses was gone. No pain beside a little stinging within the first 2 hours of application. It also didnt leave any scars or discolloration. Worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> worked well - good delivery</li>
    <li> I can no longer find these at the store. I like them because they go on like a band-aid &amp; they stay in place better than the round discs. It doesn&#x27;t move when I pull my sock over it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I had three treatments and the entire corn fell off. My baby toe is now bright red and looks painful but its not. I just would like to see the healing process to give it good reviews. I had two corns each one on the baby toe for 12 years so far so good hope my skin heals perfect and makes a normal toe again. Will update in a month to let you guys know.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, the pain left after first application, by second application the corn was completely gone, peeled off immediately.  It leaves it white in that area, pigmentation started coming back within days.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered works well arrived early</li>
    <li> I like it. It helps removing my small corn within few days. I recommend it if you have small corn. However, I haven&#x27;t tried with a big corn.</li>
    <li> I work in an office and am always wearing heels and a corn formed on my toe. I decided to try out this item and after 4 uses the corn and the skin around the corn peeled off! I highly recommend this item. It really does work although not as a few of a treatment as it states.</li>
    <li> Have corn on end of toe, got way too wide and into the good skin. Made my toe more sore than the corn was.</li>
    <li> I first started using this and after the first application, i saw nothing. Then what I did was cut a little of my corn with a razor, then I applied 2 more times, both 48hr intervals, and BOOM, the corn turned white and just basically fell off. I also didn&#x27;t wear the shoes that caused the corn in the first place during using this.</li>
    <li> it seems to have worked, lets see if it doesnt become large again</li>
    <li> It worked after the therd plaster !!</li>
    <li> The bandages do not hold the corn cap in place. They are too small and lacks good adhesive properties. Had to use other bandages to hold the cap in place. Will not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> A MUST FOR  FOR YOUR FEET!!</li>
    <li> It truly is a help when it comes to hard to find nasty corns.  It has helped me immensely.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Worked great removed my corn in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works or not, because it fells so easily. It says to use a new one after two days, but it can barely stay for one day.</li>
    <li> Waste of money waste of time. No improvement.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this is a &amp;#34;one-step corn remover&amp;#34;.  I used the entire pack on one area and all it did was fry circles into the surrounding healthy parts of my skin.  I suppose I&#x27;ll keep trying with other products.</li>
    <li> I just received these and tried them. I dont really see any results other than the white spot on my toe which I hope goes away in time.</li>
