### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>One day I stumbled across the video and was impressed how well it worked for the demonstrator.</li>
      <li>I was originally impressed when I read these great reviews on line and watched the videos.  </li>
      <li>It worked great, but after a couple of hours I checked on it again.</li>
      <li>Do not recommend if you plan on making expressions after applying  lol also, you could see a milky layer where applied</li>
      <li>Ladies you are way more beautiful than you think you are.  </li>
      <li>Not what I would have liked.</li>
      <li>probably a fault of my own skin, but im so disapoiinted.</li>
      <li>It worked, but was thicker in consistency than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
      <li>If you keep your face completely expressionless then you will see a wonderful improvement!</li>
      <li>and I smiled there were actually MORE wrinkles because it acts like a layer of glue.</li>
      <li>Sincerely, N. RODRIGUEZ</li>
      <li>Temporary fix for sure.</li>
      <li>, She was just being overcritical about herself &#x27; like most women do&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>The more wrinkles you have, the more you have to add.</li>
      <li>It was just ok.</li>
      <li>When I snipped the top off of the vial......</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this works great for some people, but it didn&#x27;t do much for</li>
      <li>OK, here is the deal, I am Kelly, Andrew&#x27;s wife, we share the prime :0)&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>For the price I was expecting a lot more.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions perfectly and even tried again the next day.</li>
      <li>Too pricey, but does work pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Not bad but won&#x27;t get more.</li>
      <li>I used it however and you could see a huge change in the bags under my eyes and the wrinkles on my forehead and eyes.  </li>
      <li>I wish I read the comments here on Amazon first before buying!!</li>
      <li>it works on my left undereye great, but for some reason my right eye doesnt take!</li>
      <li>I would use this on special occasions</li>
      <li>videos you see of this miraculous product are all true.</li>
      <li>Then, don&#x27;t smile and don&#x27;t touch your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I threw them in the trash after the first use.</li>
      <li>This is the only solution I came up to get the most applications out of one packet.</li>
      <li>But now I am very thankful that&#x27;s all I bought!</li>
      <li>I was super excited when I was gifted one of the small sample packs from a friend and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Product came in very cheap packaging with no introduction or explanation of how to use, how long it lasts etc.</li>
      <li>Stiff stuff , fades skin color works great as long as you don&#x27;t smile of laugh, laugh out loud</li>
      <li>Does it last long and look good?</li>
      <li>but I thought it was because I was looking GOOD not with this white dry film under my EYES.&lt;br /&gt;SO</li>
      <li>This stuff really does make your bags and wrinkles disappear and is amazing, for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>like it does in the videos you really need to have the wrinkles, bags etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like putting a clear face mask on your face and then try to smile.</li>
      <li>The tightening feeling got more intense with this layer along with a slight burning sensation under one eye.</li>
      <li>I took it one step further for the sake of the full experience, which probably isn&#x27;t recommended, and applied another layer, this time using a sweeping motion.</li>
      <li>Get better results using cream to powder make up but definitely doesn&#x27;t last 7 to 9 hours</li>
      <li>did all the photos in the same room, so I&#x27;m not quite sure why the lighting looks different in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And what I was able to get on just made my skin feel tight and it flaked.</li>
      <li>The cream doesn&#x27;t remain soft and easy to apply, only possible after first use.  </li>
      <li>On a clean and dry face.</li>
      <li>When you put on the product it is like leaving a clear barrier on your face that leaves a seal under your eye.  </li>
      <li>the package stated 2-3 uses i only was able to use one time and the oil dried up  as soon as i open the tube - no way to close the tube - and i really did not see any results</li>
      <li>If not then do not waste your time and money.  </li>
      <li>Each packet can last about 3-4 applications if you use sparingly (doesn&#x27;t take much).</li>
      <li>Im just natural...</li>
      <li>Its very much like smearing Elmers glue under your eyes and waiting for it to dry.  </li>
      <li>you simply must use it, I would suggest you apply the makeup first, and then the Instantly Ageless.</li>
      <li>it was maybe if not less than the size of a bb.</li>
      <li>You also do all your stuff like you normally would and then use a tiny drop and dab around under eye and lid.  </li>
      <li>Once fully dry, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>So far it dont look white to me.</li>
      <li>My make up, i use bare minerals does NOT contain oil either.  </li>
      <li>The thing  about this stuff is you really need to have wrinkles, bags under your eyes, or discoloration, IE dark circles under your eyes type of thing for it to work.  </li>

<li> The thing  about this stuff is you really need to have wrinkles, bags under your eyes, or discoloration, IE dark circles under your eyes type of thing for it to work.  </li>
<li> It feels like you have applied white Elmers glue to your face and allowed it to dry, and after a bit, it looks like you smeared white Elmers glue on your face too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It is not professional to &amp;#34;sell&amp;#34;</li>
<li> All it did was dry and tighten the skin under the eyes</li>
<li> I applied it to both bags with a patting motion and waited for it to dry.</li>
<li> It starts peeling and flaking, and if you put makeup over it, the makeup looks about as horrid as if you put makeup on a face with extremely dry skin.</li>
<li> It actually gave me crows feet for the next few hours.</li>
<li> I did noticed a difference after the second application, it almost looked like it gave me dark under eye circles and an additional bag, even tho</li>
<li> My order arrived in a box with little individual packets.</li>
<li> I can see a difference but not worth the trouble since it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
<li> But once you smile your face wrinkles and creases worse then you have ever seen your face wrinkle!</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> This is not a permanent fix, If the applied cream gets wet from water or sweat you may need to reapply the cream again.</li>
<li> product is a pink color, consistency of a lotion.</li>
<li> The areaaround my eyes dried up, and turned red and irritaed</li>
<li> Was a similar product out a few years ago.</li>
<li> No more samples for me in the future.</li>
<li> I apply it under my eyes, then place another small piece of tape back over the opening.</li>
<li> The lady applies a small amount of Instantly Ageless cream and you can see the bags under her eyes vanish.</li>
<li> I agree with the other reviews that it is like putting elmers glue under your eyes.</li>
<li> Of theres other things then u can contact me on instagram @jazzakadimplez</li>
<li> It cakes up in all the little nooks and crannies, making your face look even worse, not to mention the fact that you really can&#x27;t touch your face after you apply it, as any rubbing will collapse the effect.</li>
<li> As it dried it gave a tightening feeling, similar to what others mentioned, like glue had dried on my skin.</li>
<li> put this on my eyes because I have always had dark circles and bags under my eyes.</li>
<li> and ive always had dark eye cirlcles and puffness...</li>
<li> I put a small piece of tape over the opening of the packet each time I use it so the product doesn&#x27;t dry out between uses.</li>
<li> I was frustrated at first because I didn&#x27;t even read that it was for 1 single vile.  </li>
<li> It makes the skin tight and you cannot have any moisturizer on before or after.</li>
<li> product to thick to come out of tube.and to dry to spread.no stars</li>
<li> After it had fully dried I had a residue from the product, possibly due to over applying, the tightening sensation wasn&#x27;t horrible, but for me it was uncomfortable ( more intense dried glue feeling).</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not very appealing to us just-over-middleagers.</li>
<li> just ok......seemed a little dried out.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work a waste of money</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> I use it everyday before going to work or going out for the evening.</li>
<li> The burning sensation never dissipated so after taking a photo I went and wiped the dried product off.</li>
<li> It looked like I had dried up eye boogers all around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Just save your money for the surgery, this is a waste.</li>
<li> This was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> Waste of time and money</li>
<li> Just another sham.</li>
<li> Please dont waste your time or money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work a waste of money</li>
    <li> Waste of money !!!!! Don&#x27;t fall for this product. It did nothing n left a white film</li>
    <li> This was a waste of my money. I saw no difference. I followed the directions perfectly and even tried again the next day. I felt the pull on my skin but could not see a difference.</li>
    <li> It was like a piece of plastic was put under your eyes just using the tiny bit I used.  When you&#x27;d ratch or rub your eye, it peeled off.</li>
    <li> Did not work.  Just another sham.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed. Did not work, as well as it shows in the ad</li>
    <li> This product did help with some of my lines and wrinkles but as soon as it dried and I smiled there were actually MORE wrinkles because it acts like a layer of glue. Do not recommend if you plan on making expressions after applying  lol also, you could see a milky layer where applied and I did not apply any make up at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give it one star. How ever what happen after it drys it leaves a noticeable film on your skin. Not what wanted after I had tried and went out for the evening I was getting look but I thought it was because I was looking GOOD not with this white dry film under my EYES.&lt;br /&gt;SO Embarrassed&lt;br /&gt;Jenn</li>
    <li> It worked, but was thicker in consistency than I would&#x27;ve liked. Plus if you put make up over it, it will ruin the seal of product. Temporary fix for sure. Not what I would have liked.</li>
    <li> just ok......seemed a little dried out.</li>
    <li> It does what is says it will do... On a clean and dry face. Put makeup on or moisturizer and all bets are off. Also it sometimes leaves a white film under your eyes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This stuff really does make your bags and wrinkles disappear and is amazing, for a few minutes. It feels like you have applied white Elmers glue to your face and allowed it to dry, and after a bit, it looks like you smeared white Elmers glue on your face too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The videos you see of this miraculous product are all true. But what they don&#x27;t show is how it looks after it&#x27;s been on your skin for a while. It starts peeling and flaking, and if you put makeup over it, the makeup looks about as horrid as if you put makeup on a face with extremely dry skin. It cakes up in all the little nooks and crannies, making your face look even worse, not to mention the fact that you really can&#x27;t touch your face after you apply it, as any rubbing will collapse the effect. So essentially, putting it on and then applying makeup over it is impossible if you want to keep your face firm and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you simply must use it, I would suggest you apply the makeup first, and then the Instantly Ageless. Then, don&#x27;t smile and don&#x27;t touch your face.&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my eyes because I have always had dark circles and bags under my eyes. It worked great, but after a couple of hours I checked on it again. It looked like I had dried up eye boogers all around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, does it work? Yes. Does it last long and look good? No</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Product came in very cheap packaging with no introduction or explanation of how to use, how long it lasts etc. For the price I was expecting a lot more.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t believe this product works, go to UTUBE and watch the video clip. The lady applies a small amount of Instantly Ageless cream and you can see the bags under her eyes vanish. I use it everyday before going to work or going out for the evening. This is not a permanent fix, If the applied cream gets wet from water or sweat you may need to reapply the cream again. Hey, even though this is not a permanent fix,  It makes me feel younger again when I look in the mirror. My order arrived in a box with little individual packets. Each packet can last about 3-4 applications if you use sparingly (doesn&#x27;t take much). I put a small piece of tape over the opening of the packet each time I use it so the product doesn&#x27;t dry out between uses. I use scissors to cut off a small portion of the packet each time I apply it under my eyes, then place another small piece of tape back over the opening. This is the only solution I came up to get the most applications out of one packet. The product didn&#x27;t work on my deeper wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It worked in a sense.... If you keep your face completely expressionless then you will see a wonderful improvement! But once you smile your face wrinkles and creases worse then you have ever seen your face wrinkle! It&#x27;s like putting a clear face mask on your face and then try to smile.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, save your money</li>
    <li> Worst eye product ever. All it did was dry and tighten the skin under the eyes</li>
    <li> DOES NOT BLEND IN TO WELL.</li>
    <li> Was a similar product out a few years ago. Its very much like smearing Elmers glue under your eyes and waiting for it to dry.  Does what it says but then dries and flakes or peels off. Just save your money for the surgery, this is a waste.</li>
    <li> left a residue under eyes</li>
    <li> The product sells over priced ,I&#x27;m  very disappointed !!!</li>
    <li> It was just ok. No good at all when using liquid make up. Get better results using cream to powder make up but definitely doesn&#x27;t last 7 to 9 hours</li>
    <li> Everyone talks negative about it but it works for me, im 31 and ive always had dark eye cirlcles and puffness... So far it dont look white to me. No foundation on my eyes or makeup... Im just natural... Of theres other things then u can contact me on instagram @jazzakadimplez</li>
    <li> Horrible it came with no lid and empty</li>
    <li> it was the worst product ever</li>
    <li> Made my under eyes look chalky and unnatural. The more wrinkles you have, the more you have to add. It&#x27;s not very appealing to us just-over-middleagers.</li>
    <li> the package stated 2-3 uses i only was able to use one time and the oil dried up  as soon as i open the tube - no way to close the tube - and i really did not see any results</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Leave white residue kinda like crazy glue leaves on a dark surface. It actually gave me crows feet for the next few hours. I&#x27;m only 26.</li>
    <li> It may work for awhile to make puffiness recede; however, once the tubes are opened, the cream dries out inside, creating clumps when you press to get cream out.  The cream doesn&#x27;t remain soft and easy to apply, only possible after first use.  I would not order again.</li>
    <li> Too pricey, but does work pretty good.  I can&#x27;t help but thinking there is a way to do this with egg whites and face cream mixed up.  Actresses used to wear egg white masks underneath their makeup all the time to make their faces taut.  I&#x27;m going to try to mix coconut oil and egg white and see if it does the same thing.</li>
    <li> The thing  about this stuff is you really need to have wrinkles, bags under your eyes, or discoloration, IE dark circles under your eyes type of thing for it to work.  My wife and I tried it and it did nothing for her but she looks alot younger then all of our friends, She was just being overcritical about herself &#x27; like most women do&#x27;.  I used it however and you could see a huge change in the bags under my eyes and the wrinkles on my forehead and eyes.  For this product to work for you like it does in the videos you really need to have the wrinkles, bags etc. not just &amp;#34;think&amp;#34; you do. Ladies you are way more beautiful than you think you are.  If you think a cosmetic surgeon can help your appearance then buy this miracle in a bottle and IT WILL WORK!!! If not then do not waste your time and money.  That is just what my wife and I found out and we are now distributors because of this.</li>
    <li> Stiff stuff , fades skin color works great as long as you don&#x27;t smile of laugh, laugh out loud</li>
    <li> This,stuff dont work exsply over or under make up it only last for 5 min till you move your face</li>
    <li> One day I stumbled across the video and was impressed how well it worked for the demonstrator. I looked into finding a sample to try and was disappointed when I saw one packet was 7 bucks. I was super excited when I was gifted one of the small sample packs from a friend and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try. I was blessed with terrible bags and have had them since I was young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a pink color, consistency of a lotion. I applied it to both bags with a patting motion and waited for it to dry. As it dried it gave a tightening feeling, similar to what others mentioned, like glue had dried on my skin. Once fully dry, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. I took it one step further for the sake of the full experience, which probably isn&#x27;t recommended, and applied another layer, this time using a sweeping motion. The tightening feeling got more intense with this layer along with a slight burning sensation under one eye. After it had fully dried I had a residue from the product, possibly due to over applying, the tightening sensation wasn&#x27;t horrible, but for me it was uncomfortable ( more intense dried glue feeling). The burning sensation never dissipated so after taking a photo I went and wiped the dried product off. I did noticed a difference after the second application, it almost looked like it gave me dark under eye circles and an additional bag, even tho the product was applied evenly under the entire eye. I attached photos of before and after each process and also how it appeared on my finger after it dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not my cup of tea and I won&#x27;t be purchasing. I&#x27;m sure this works great for some people, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did all the photos in the same room, so I&#x27;m not quite sure why the lighting looks different in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo 3- nothing applied&lt;br /&gt;Photo 4- one coat&lt;br /&gt;Photo5- two coats</li>
    <li> I wish I read the comments here on Amazon first before buying!! I was originally impressed when I read these great reviews on line and watched the videos.  This product is terrible and a waste of money.  I was frustrated at first because I didn&#x27;t even read that it was for 1 single vile.  But now I am very thankful that&#x27;s all I bought!</li>
    <li> Burned the heck out of my under eye area and left sore red marks. It did however get rid of bags!</li>
    <li> I was so not impressed with this product ! It was like rubbing Elmers Glue on your face and was impossible to apply make up over. Save your money and use an organic product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me, totally disappointed and it left a white film on my face.😳</li>
    <li> False advertising... DID NOT WORK.... Waste of time and money</li>
    <li> Does not work! I agree with the other reviews that it is like putting elmers glue under your eyes. It left me with what looked like chemical burns under my eyes and on my finger. Please dont waste your time or money. Such a scam. I had bought 2 tubes hoping this was my lifesaver and I threw them in the trash after the first use.</li>
    <li> Not bad but won&#x27;t get more. It makes the skin tight and you cannot have any moisturizer on before or after. It also make it feel chalky to the touch. I can see a difference but not worth the trouble since it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> it works on my left undereye great, but for some reason my right eye doesnt take! probably a fault of my own skin, but im so disapoiinted.</li>
    <li> Had no effect on me. Waste of money</li>
    <li> product to thick to come out of tube.and to dry to spread.no stars</li>
    <li> OK, here is the deal, I am Kelly, Andrew&#x27;s wife, we share the prime :0)&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend gave me a tube of this to use.  I will tell you why it did not work on some people.  She explained to me that you HAVE TO use a water soluble make up and lotion.  My face lotion has no oil, if yours has oil or your make up the product can&#x27;t stick to the eye, water and oil don&#x27;t mix.  My make up, i use bare minerals does NOT contain oil either.  You also do all your stuff like you normally would and then use a tiny drop and dab around under eye and lid.  I just did this this morning.  When you put on the product it is like leaving a clear barrier on your face that leaves a seal under your eye.  This is not permanent it won&#x27;t get rid of them just cover them when you need to.  I would use this on special occasions</li>
    <li> The areaaround my eyes dried up, and turned red and irritaed, i am presently returning another order that i purchased and it was very difficult to get the product out of the vile, i had to cut it to get some out, thats why i didnt return it as well. Sincerely, N. RODRIGUEZ</li>
    <li> What I ordered for the money I paid was not even enough to put on my skin. I was totally disappointed at the tiny vials I received for 12.00 which included shipping charges. When I snipped the top off of the vial......it was maybe if not less than the size of a bb. And what I was able to get on just made my skin feel tight and it flaked. No more samples for me in the future. It is not professional to &amp;#34;sell&amp;#34; something that there is not enough to even see if it would work. No thank you on this one.</li>
