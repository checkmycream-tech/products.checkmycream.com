    <li> This gift, bought from Amazon is being greatly enjoyed and was appreciated.</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorites! And I don&#x27;t mind her wearing it at all. Even though it was ordered late during the holidays, the seller made every effort to get it to us on time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product off of Amazon. The shipping packaging was a little roughed up when it got here, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume was what I expected, and authentic.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell much different then the original Hypnotic Poison, but perhap&#x27;s a litte more floral. The bottle is really pretty, like the other poison bottles. This Hypnotic Poison Sensualle has a purple cap.&lt;br /&gt;If your expecting something totally different then the original Hypnotic Poison, don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s too similar and the spicy smell is the same.&lt;br /&gt;This is a lovely and unique scent. My Mom also loves it.</li>
    <li> i buy this product and never recive , still im waiting for my money . be carefull.</li>
    <li> I wanted a new scent (I wore Versace Bright Crystal for 4 years) and was looking for a sweet, spicy, and earthy scent (that&#x27;s me!). Hypnotic Poison is all that. I really like it! I get a lot of compliments. My boyfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> One of my best perfume ever</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! Even tho it was the wrong one!!!</li>
    <li> Smells like a rootbeer float and floral. Light scent that is great for summer and might curb food cravings.</li>
    <li> CD Poison was my signature scent a long time ago.  This smells like my grandmother bathed in vanilla.  I hate it.  If I could return... I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
    <li> This is a lovely selection from the Dior collection!  It has beautiful vanilla notes and is long-lasting. Every time I wear this fragrance, my sweet husband always tells me how nice it is and how much he likes it.  A true winner!</li>
    <li> I love ithis one a lot!</li>
    <li> this is one of the best smelling fragrance&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever boughten, I dislike heavy perfumes and this one is just right, I get many complaiments on it every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. I was very timing being processed and shipped. My daughter just love the fragrance. She actually carries it with her all the time. Thanks so much. Randy</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume off and on for 10 years! I love it and often get comments from others about how good I smell!</li>
    <li> Exquisite fragrance, sweet, fresh, sensual touches durable, makes you feel like a movie star, I loved it. Totally recommend the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it. Ordered two times and will order again. Received many compliments.  Become my favorite!!!</li>
    <li> This scent is subtle, not at all over powering, but it is longlasting on me. A very sexy, sultry scent. I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> OMG - I love this perfume - it is the only perfume I own.  I usually use essential oils.</li>
    <li> Do not read my review if you are a women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells a little too light, but my wife is happy and that&#x27;s the most important. Probably because it is one of the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, it&#x27;s such a irony as many things are judged by the price tag, not anything else; especially in jewelry, fragrance, beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever it is, it serves the purpose to make you loved one happy. It&#x27;s a shame it works this way. But great product that serves the purpose.</li>
