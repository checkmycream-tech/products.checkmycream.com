### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Though this product doesn&#x27;t contain zinc oxide, from what I can see, my skin does look great!</li>
      <li>Like flawless, I&#x27;m not wearing foundation if I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal has very good skin care products, but this sunscreen is not one of them.</li>
      <li>and it work great</li>
      <li>The product worked great, although the consistency of the lotion became chunky soon after I started using it.</li>
      <li>so when I find it I was happy</li>
      <li>But I trust my sister-in-law&#x27;s choice of sun lotion since she takes great care of her skin.</li>
      <li>it is great, no grease, smell good too.</li>
      <li>I think Neutrogena is much better!</li>
      <li>However the oil and creme kind of separated.</li>
      <li>My doctor has a great, funny personality, so I thought he was kidding!</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll start putting this on at night, since that makes it more effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a very fair, natural straw-berry-blonde redhead.</li>
      <li>I think I would recommend neutrogena more.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find this Loreal product, a brand I trust, in SPF 100, and even more pleased to find it on amazon.com where it is easy and quick to order.</li>
      <li>Note I have fair skin, that burns easily, pink cheeks</li>
      <li>Fortunately, from the time I was 17 years old, I have stayed out of the sun, the sunburn and sun poisoning just wasn&#x27;t worth and no sunscreens seemed to help me.</li>
      <li>when I&#x27;m hot or embarrassed, I sweat a lot on my face, mreh.</li>
      <li>My face looked very shiny because of the grease!</li>
      <li>Really thick but very effective.</li>
      <li>I found this product to be very oily.</li>
      <li>I never used this personally, so I really shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing it; however my sister-in-law swears by it.</li>
      <li>so I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s expired or if it is like that.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I saw fantastic, but the product arrived open and damaged.</li>
      <li>And it really protect my from sun, the skin where don&#x27;t have this lotion</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to review this product, but I just read an article about how a girl used sunscreen to clear her acne by putting it on at night, something about zinc oxide, and I just found that to be interesting, because I&#x27;ve been using this regularly since I bought it three days ago</li>
      <li>I live in the Dominican Republic and I get very costly to return the product.</li>
      <li>Lastly, it smells good, but not strong, I&#x27;m allergic to everything.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years and will continue to do so as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
      <li>And as I&#x27;m very vocal, and live in Texas both of those things are frequent.  </li>
      <li>, How can I use this regularly after only 3 days, I live in Texas and have an adorable beagle that needs twice daily walks.</li>
      <li>I only purchased it for my son and do not have first hand experience with it.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin so soft and not sticky.</li>
      <li>but when I recived and use it it was watery and looked old ...</li>
      <li>Wow, I purchased 6 pieces for my Malaysia trip.</li>
      <li>but nothing has worked so far.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had trouble with sun and heat my whole life--from sunburn to sun poisoning to passing out in the sun as early as 7 years old!</li>
      <li>I tanned anyway, so not sure if the SPF 100 is really worth it.</li>

    <li> Goopy, slimy &amp; watery.  Felt like it was an expired product.  Will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> Guess who didn&#x27;t burn in Cancun?! Me! The product worked great, although the consistency of the lotion became chunky soon after I started using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too greasy and the texture looks like yogurt so I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s expired or if it is like that.</li>
    <li> I never used this personally, so I really shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing it; however my sister-in-law swears by it. I only purchased it for my son and do not have first hand experience with it. But I trust my sister-in-law&#x27;s choice of sun lotion since she takes great care of her skin.</li>
    <li> Really thick but very effective. Leaves your skin so soft and not sticky. SPF100</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with sun and heat my whole life--from sunburn to sun poisoning to passing out in the sun as early as 7 years old! For 25 years, I have been a victim of SLE, commonly known as Lupus, which is activated by sun exposure. I was having reactions to the sun by just walking to and from my car. I&#x27;m a very fair, natural straw-berry-blonde redhead. Fortunately, from the time I was 17 years old, I have stayed out of the sun, the sunburn and sun poisoning just wasn&#x27;t worth and no sunscreens seemed to help me. Recently, I had to see a Dermatologist for the removal of a questionable mole (thank goodness, it was benign). The Dermatologist said I needed to use 100-110 sunscreen under my make-up and on my hands, shoulders, neck, etc. My doctor has a great, funny personality, so I thought he was kidding! I&#x27;d never seen anything above a 50SPF in the drugstore. I was pleased to find this Loreal product, a brand I trust, in SPF 100, and even more pleased to find it on amazon.com where it is easy and quick to order. It goes on without being sticky or smelly. Thank you amazon and Loreal!</li>
    <li> Was not please with it especially what I paid for it I was using this product for about 2yrs and it work great but almost all stores like Wal-Mart RITE AIDE CSV and other stores discontinued this cream so when I find it I was happy but when I recived and use it it was watery and looked old ...I order another one with another companys and it was rhe same one I use before...</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very oily. I used it when I went on vacation and still got a noticeable tan. Probably it will work for someone else but it didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> it is great, no grease, smell good too.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t horrible nor great. It makes your skin very pale if you use for 3 weeks continually. I think I would recommend neutrogena more.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and will continue to do so as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
    <li> Wow, I purchased 6 pieces for my Malaysia trip. And it really protect my from sun, the skin where don&#x27;t have this lotion it turns black and hurts. But the lotion didnot work when I jump into water, everytime I go back to the ship I have to apply around my body.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to review this product, but I just read an article about how a girl used sunscreen to clear her acne by putting it on at night, something about zinc oxide, and I just found that to be interesting, because I&#x27;ve been using this regularly since I bought it three days ago, How can I use this regularly after only 3 days, I live in Texas and have an adorable beagle that needs twice daily walks. Though this product doesn&#x27;t contain zinc oxide, from what I can see, my skin does look great! Like flawless, I&#x27;m not wearing foundation if I don&#x27;t have to. Note I have fair skin, that burns easily, pink cheeks that blush when I&#x27;m hot or embarrassed, I sweat a lot on my face, mreh. And as I&#x27;m very vocal, and live in Texas both of those things are frequent.  Also I&#x27;m brunette, of Spanish descent. Lastly, it smells good, but not strong, I&#x27;m allergic to everything. I think I&#x27;ll start putting this on at night, since that makes it more effective.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal has very good skin care products, but this sunscreen is not one of them. I bought it because it says non-greasy and I have oily skin. However the oil and creme kind of separated. My face looked very shiny because of the grease! I think Neutrogena is much better!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rather goopy, making it hard to spread. I tanned anyway, so not sure if the SPF 100 is really worth it.</li>
    <li> I used it whole summer everyday, but still got tan on neck and face. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I do not know how this sunscreen performs in the sun, but for the past 30 minutes since I put it on and apparently got some in my eyes they have been burning non-stop.  I&#x27;ve tried washing it off and flushing my eyes with water but nothing has worked so far.  Needless to say, I am not buying this stuff again.</li>
    <li> Hello! I bought this product because I saw fantastic, but the product arrived open and damaged. I live in the Dominican Republic and I get very costly to return the product.</li>
