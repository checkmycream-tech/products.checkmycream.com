      <li>Smells great, keeps away smell, what more could you want form it?</li>
      <li>Love the smell, great performance.</li>
      <li>it proves its performance up to a very good %.</li>
      <li>It is just portable and handy.</li>
      <li>Nice if you are into that, but I would prefer it just kill odor rather than masking it with perfumes.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>The scent on the &amp;#34;Playmaker&amp;#34; is very strong.</li>
      <li>This is another best product in old spice line.</li>
      <li>Works well, smells good, just not as clean as I like.</li>
      <li>Personally, I&#x27;m more for the &amp;#34;just out of the shower&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>love the fragrance of this, but it doesnt protect you 24 hours like it claims.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
      <li>Wife loves the way I smell :)</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant sent and really blocks out any sweat odors.</li>
      <li>Old Spice Playmaker is a very nice scent that is more of a cologne than a deodorant.  </li>
      <li>I figured I would stock up on deodorant on the cheap since it&#x27;s one of those one-off things I always end up rushing to the store for.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes I wonder that Amazon gets their own cheaper versions of products (the same way that Macys has their own version of CK and Ralph Lauren).</li>
      <li>The price is good and it last all day.</li>
      <li>Good value overall.</li>
      <li>Packaging is great and easy to hold in hand without being too bulky.. as you can see; I pay attention to all the little things too.</li>
      <li>Product was as described and delivered quickly.</li>
      <li>Goes on pretty smooth too.</li>
      <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t bother my skin and likely won&#x27;t yours, but unless you have a very strong smell you need to cover up, this will make you smell like a cheap air freshener.</li>
      <li>Been using this for a few months now, it works great.</li>
      <li>The product is good and It is working quite well even in extreme weather condition</li>
      <li>Not in terms of daily scent protection, but in how many times a stick can be used.  </li>
      <li>Nothing really to complain about here.</li>
      <li>Works very well for my husband.  </li>
      <li>You have to shower briskly to really get the stuff</li>
      <li>I am allergic to many deodorants and can generally only use Old Spice solids.</li>
      <li>I recommend this particularly to the sporty types out there.  </li>
      <li>but I miss Degree&#x27;s High Endurance POWER scent.  </li>
      <li>If you end up with underarm inflammation or itching, I highly suggest this.</li>
      <li>Good deal, although it feels like this product last much less than the store bought Old Spice antiperspirants.  </li>
      <li>Delivered exactly as expected and quickly.</li>
      <li>I still sweat visibly through a shirt even, but that is with any brand any deodorant I have found over the counter thus far.  </li>
      <li>Scent of Old Spice is one I do like.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands and this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s been using Old Spice High Endurance Invisible Solid for over 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I generally use Old Spice.</li>
      <li>It works very well for a long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d give it 16 hours with modest movement, 8 or less if you really working it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s subtle, sweet yet manly, and rolls on invisibly - no unsightly armsicles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this deodorant, says it does keep him dry, except in extreme conditions..  </li>

<li> My husband really likes this deodorant, says it does keep him dry, except in extreme conditions..  </li>
<li> But... every other antiperspirant/deodorant I&#x27;ve ever bought did the same thing.  </li>
<li> I tried buying him a regular deodorant without the antiperspirant because he&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t perspire heavily, but he didn&#x27;t care for it, so we&#x27;re back to this.</li>
<li> I also find that Old Spice (previously used Fiji and other varieties) tends to roll on so heavy that it leaves a bit of a film.  </li>
<li> I usually use the plain Old Spice deodorant.</li>
<li> only complaint is that it  leaves deposits on his under shirts.  </li>
<li> I found I had to use less of this deodorant than comparible</li>
<li> Protection lasts quite a while, unless you are very active.  </li>
<li> That one was always a hit in tight quarters.  </li>
<li> When im mountaineering or hiking it prevents smell for the trip, but i can sweat through it in just a few hours.</li>
<li> I find myself switching sticks at least once a month.  </li>
<li> However, this white flaky deodorant made my armpits itch like crazy all the time.</li>
<li> : You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>

    <li> My husband really likes this deodorant, says it does keep him dry, except in extreme conditions..  And he also likes the scent.</li>
    <li> Very good price.  It should last me awhile.  Arrived when promised.</li>
    <li> I bought these and thought they&#x27;d be great. I generally use Old Spice. However, this white flaky deodorant made my armpits itch like crazy all the time. I eventually had to throw them away.</li>

    <li> Smells great,  came in a day and does the job.</li>
    <li> Delivered exactly as expected and quickly.</li>
    <li> Although this product name makes me think of the 1950&#x27;s it has worked for me about 5 years. The price is good and it last all day.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells good, just not as clean as I like. Would suggest finding a different stick but the same brand.</li>
    <li> Nothing really to complain about here. It&#x27;s deodorant. Smells great, keeps away smell, what more could you want form it?</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as a deodorant. I usually use the plain Old Spice deodorant. I guess that&#x27;s why it was on sale.</li>
    <li> I still sweat visibly through a shirt even, but that is with any brand any deodorant I have found over the counter thus far.  Scent of Old Spice is one I do like.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to many deodorants and can generally only use Old Spice solids. If you end up with underarm inflammation or itching, I highly suggest this.

Thankfully it passes as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Hypoallergenic&lt;br /&gt;Long-lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Strong perfume</li>
    <li> Wife loves the way I smell :)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite antiperspirant/deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands and this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Very effective&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting protection&lt;br /&gt;Actually works&lt;br /&gt;Stops &amp;#34;stress sweat&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY: You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. It works very well for a long time. The smell is nice but not overpowering.</li>

    <li> We always love our OS products and this deodorant is great! It has a pleasant sent and really blocks out any sweat odors. Packaging is great and easy to hold in hand without being too bulky.. as you can see; I pay attention to all the little things too. Another thing, the come in a subsribe save package which will save you alot of money if bought together!</li>
    <li> Perfect, Keep the good work going. I will recommend this is my dear one. It is just portable and handy.</li>
    <li> I figured I would stock up on deodorant on the cheap since it&#x27;s one of those one-off things I always end up rushing to the store for.  Old Spice Playmaker is a very nice scent that is more of a cologne than a deodorant.  It&#x27;s subtle, sweet yet manly, and rolls on invisibly - no unsightly armsicles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is noticeable yet not overpowering.  Protection lasts quite a while, unless you are very active.  I found I had to use less of this deodorant than comparible products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this a four-star rating but I miss Degree&#x27;s High Endurance POWER scent.  That one was always a hit in tight quarters.  I also find that Old Spice (previously used Fiji and other varieties) tends to roll on so heavy that it leaves a bit of a film.  You have to shower briskly to really get the stuff off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No biggy.  That just means the scent lasts longer! *wink-wink, nudge-nudge*  I dig this.  I recommend this particularly to the sporty types out there.  Personally, I&#x27;m more for the &amp;#34;just out of the shower&amp;#34; scent but this deodorant helps me reduce cologne use.  Cost-effective!</li>
    <li> This is another best product in old spice line. Lasting 24hrs. Smelling very nice.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> Works very well for my husband.  He&#x27;s happy with it, and I think it smells great.  He&#x27;s been using Old Spice High Endurance Invisible Solid for over 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it  leaves deposits on his under shirts.  But... every other antiperspirant/deodorant I&#x27;ve ever bought did the same thing.  I tried buying him a regular deodorant without the antiperspirant because he&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t perspire heavily, but he didn&#x27;t care for it, so we&#x27;re back to this.</li>
