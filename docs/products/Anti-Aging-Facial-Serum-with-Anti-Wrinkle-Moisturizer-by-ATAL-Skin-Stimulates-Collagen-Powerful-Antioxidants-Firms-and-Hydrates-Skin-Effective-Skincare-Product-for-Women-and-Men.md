<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have only been using it for a couple of weeks now, so it is too early to see wrinkle improvement.  But I love how easy this cream goes on, smooth and quickly absorbed.  My skin already feels softer with its use.  And I love that it has no odor....I am very sensitive to odors.  I will be updating my reviews at 6 weeks of use!</li>
    <li> My mother love it very much, She said: it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  I have been using it for a couple weeks now and I do notice a difference.  My face seems tighter and smooth.  I do not know if I look any younger but I sure feel like it has made a difference in the heath of my skin.  I also love the fact that while having a pleasant smell, it is not a strong smell.  I also like that it does not make your face feel greasy.  It goes on really smooth, like a lotion, but dries quick and does not feel like you have a film on your skin.  I will most likely be getting more of this. Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I am really in love with this Anti Aging Serum. I have been using it daily now for a few weeks and I think I can see some results! My skin seems firmer almost. The packaging is beautiful and the quality of the product is comparable to high end department store products. I love it alot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff, and I love it! I&#x27;m only in my mid-20s, but I have always struggled with acne, dry/oily patches, and sun damage. Also, I work in a very stressful area of healthcare, so I wanted a product I could start using now to stave-off aging as long as possible. This serum is great! The ingredients are perfect for what I wanted. Since using it, my skin tone is more even, my face is more moist without being oily, and I haven&#x27;t had any more breakouts. Also, it helps my makeup stay in place throughout the day, even without setting powder. My only complaint is that I only get about a month of use from one bottle, but I may be using too much. I use 2-3 pumps each time. I&#x27;m going to try to stretch my second bottle to last a bit longer, but I love this stuff either way.</li>
    <li> Love how this feels on my face. Use it in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> very good ingrediënts, the structure needs to be massaged into the skin although it&#x27;s quite possible that I have a loose hand and tend to overdue the amount needed per application. After say a minute or two, it sinks in and leaves no residu. All in all, this product is a pleasant surprise to me. Already ordered my 2d bottle.</li>
    <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
    <li> I loved it! Soft moist awesome, my eyes love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kinerase Ultimate Day moisturizer for several years.  However, the very steep price tag has become too much for me to justify.  S, after some research,  decided to try this product.  I have found that it works very well.  My skin is pretty sensitive, however, I have not had any itchiness from using is product.  I will definitely buy it from now on.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product to use on my dry skin. I came upon this product on recommendation of one of my friends. I have now been using this for over a month. I can honestly tell you that my skin has been feeling wonderful and refreshed! I have noticed my skin is tightening up and have been getting lots of compliments. I have been recommending this product to all of my friends. I am so glad I bought this!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it! She says it makes her skin feel really nice.</li>
    <li> I try this cream for a whole month and I don&#x27;t see any difference on my skin, too much money I pay for it and works the same..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product reviews are good that much.  I wish it worked like what they say. But it didn&#x27;t.  Not bad,but nothing special.</li>
    <li> Product spreads easily, absorbs fully, no residue. Thinner consistency than Anavita Moisturizing Anti wrinkle cream, so I use a combination of both to facilitate ease of application. I researched the ingredients list on ewg.org/skindeep/ prior to purchase, and it does not contain any concerning or toxic compounds. Sellers offer discounts and promotional items after purchase. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice enough serum. Wife doesn&#x27;t notice any anti-aging effects, but she has really sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s not breaking her out which is always a good thing. Also, she claims that it goes well under moisturizer and make-up.</li>
    <li> I have used the same products on my face for over 10 years and in the last year have been having trouble with white heads.  No matter what I do I can not get rid of them.  I decided to try new products to see if I could get rid of them.  I have very sensitive skin that turns bright red, burns, and breaks out easily.  The few products that I have tried has caused these reactions and I keep going back to my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; products.  Then I was able to purchase this ATAL Face Serum at a promotional price so I decided to try one more product.  I must admit, I am IMPRESSED!!!  I have been using the Serum for about 2 weeks and not only can I feel a difference in my skin, but half of my white heads are gone!  My skin does not reflect the harsh weather of Winter that we have been having.  Instead it is smooth, hydrated, and firmer!  At first I would (out of habit) put my regular products over the ATAL Face Serum because I thought I needed to.  I tend to have dry skin on my face and require moisturizer daily.  It is something I can not leave the house without.  I now only need the one product!!  I will save so much money and have great skin!  I highly recommend this product, even for people with highly sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product thru a promotional period.  As soon as I took it out of the packaging I immediately smelled the lotion.  I was so pleased that it didn&#x27;t have a strong scent.  I hate lotions that have a heavy scent.  It&#x27;s very light and smells great!  The face lotion absorbs into your skin very quickly.  Anytime I use face lotions, my skin is normally red right after.  Not with this lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot, so this product will last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> Using this for a  month and works well for the price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a week of using this amazing product and I love it.... I have very sensitive skin n not every product works well but this one is just amazing ..... Definitely will keep using it.</li>
    <li> works great alone or under foundation .... not greasy ,,, I love it</li>
    <li> So far not much has changed but ima wait a few more weeks then repost my thoughts about the product</li>
    <li> Love how smooth this glides on the face and only takes a very small amount.  Never sure if these wrinkle creams really work but I don&#x27;t want to quite now!  This is one of the best creams I&#x27;ve used, feel silky smooth on my face and neck.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great customer support and enjoying the product so far</li>
    <li> So far, love it.  Only use for a week.  It is very creamy &amp; goes on smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t take much.  Get more than needed from pump.  Just wish a little more control over pump.  It is quite a lot of cream.  Not a small bottle like most.  Would recommend.  Thanx Amazon</li>
    <li> I honestly have already seen results in 3 weeks. I use this product everyday and immediately after performing  a micro needling session. Love everything about this product.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased.  I use it once a day, in the mornings before applying makeup - it&#x27;s light, not heavy.  Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I like that this absorbs readily without being greasy or leaving a film on my skin. Have not used it long enough to determine if wrinkles are lessened, but it feels good.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, feels soft and absorbs easily.  Very mild scent, and wonderful outcome.  Makes my skin tone more even, and my wrinkles less noticeable.  Others have commented on the improvement in my skin tone and texture.  I also just started using a konjac sponge to exfoliate when I cleanse, so this is definitely helping as well.  Reasonably priced compared to other name brand serums.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered it with lots of hope,my skin is dry and sensitive,i had to mix it with another moisturizer because it did not help to moisturize my skin very well. I don&#x27;t see any difference as such, but nothing happened to my skin,it do not react. yayyy</li>
    <li> I started using Advanced Serum 2 weeks ago. I have noticed a difference in small lines. I will be buying again. The serum is not greasy and has a clean light door. I really like the product and will purchase more products from Atal.</li>
    <li> Atal is so smooth you hardly know you have it on!! Makes my face feel soft .</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I have fallen in love with it. From the beautiful bottle to the way it goes on so smooth to my great results this is a five star item! I am pretty picky about what I put on my skin especially my face. This has been great, I am so happy I jumped on this promotion! No breakouts, no oily face, and my skin is feeling soft and refreshed! I am only 32 but I am bound and determined to stop wrinkles before they start! All of the vitamins and antioxidants in this product are helping to achieve and maintain my youthful look!</li>
    <li> Just a quick note, I have the most sensitive skin ever and this face serum has been wonderful!!! I am always concerned when I try a new product because most will cause a reaction, but this stuff is great!!  It smells wonderful too!!!  It&#x27;s the middle of December and my face doesn&#x27;t feel like cardboard from the dryness - I will definitely continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two weeks and I am sure I will reorder. The product was delivered promptly and the package was of excellent quality&lt;br /&gt;My very sensitive skin responded with no irritated areas and a look of freshness. I am using Atal twice a day. I need more time to respond to the long term effects. I can usually tell in a few days if a product is good for my skin. Atal is showing very good results immediately.</li>
    <li> After using this serum for several weeks I&#x27;ve noticed more firmness in my skin.  I&#x27;ve also seen some improvement in more even skin tone.  I love the citrus smell and it feels very soothing.  My face feels refreshed and moisturized every time I use it.  I&#x27;ve been applying it in the morning and at night before bed.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this so far and will keep using it!  I bought this through a promotion and  will buy this serum again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o.k.  I&#x27;ve used ones that have a more firming effect on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I have bought it because I think its so effective.  I love the consistency of the serum and have really seen some great results with my fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Such a creamy moisturizing product! My face always feels refreshed, and it leaves my face perfectly moisturized without being oily. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Mrs. North American</li>
    <li> I have been using ATAL Anti Aging Serum for a little over two weeks now. I truly have to say, I love it!!! I consider myself a beauty junkie. I usually only use the best lines usually around $100.00 (Peter Thomas Roth and Algenist). The ATAL serum works just as good and even better than the expensive serums I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this serum is very light weight and very hydrating. My skin has become very soft with a natural glow. Second, It has a great citrus smell. Third, my fine lines and wrinkles have lessened and are not as deep as before.  I have had amazing results within the first two weeks of using this product. This product contains some pretty amazing ingredients that are found in some very well known expensive products. My skin does feel a lot more firmer and my skin tone has improved because of the peptides, antioxidants and vitamins found in the serum. in regards to collagen production, my crows feet have diminished because of a special ingredient called Argireline which is also a Botox alternative.  I promise you that if you give this serum a try, you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this serum at a a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This was a present for someone and when I asked if they liked it, the answer was positive! Hope it helps.</li>
    <li> This serum helps my skin to stay soft and hydrated.  I have noticed some lines have gotton smaller. I have been using this product for a few weeks, and I can see the difference in my skin.  this product has excellent peptides. ( the best ).</li>
    <li> This Serum has worked for me.  I have sensitive skin and break out from the chemicals in beauty products.  I have had no problems at all with ATAL Anti Aging Serum.  I love it and recommend it. I wish ATAL was around when I was in my 20&#x27;s, 30&#x27;s etc.. My skin looks younger and healthier now than it did 2 months ago when I started using the Serum. I love it.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the first facial product  (having tried many) that I can definitely see an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice serum that goes on smoothly without any residue. Does not irritate or burn either - am new to this product so am hoping it will be one I keep.</li>
    <li> It felt so great on my face!  The order came in quickly!  Wasn&#x27;t greasy and didn&#x27;t clog my pores. Would buy again. For the wrinkles,  didn&#x27;t see much results, but probably need to use longer for that.</li>
    <li> I feel this product was misrepresented.  It&#x27;s called an \\&quot;Anti Wrinkle Moisturizer Cream\\&quot; here, but nowhere on the actual product once it arrives does the word \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; ever appear.  And in fact, this is not at all moisturizing enough for my skin (and I don&#x27;t have especially dry skin; other products work just fine to moisturize).  The consistency is not \\&quot;cream\\&quot;y at all, but in fact thin and runny.  Because this serum is not at all moisturizing, I have to apply an actual moisturizer over it every time I use it.  I haven&#x27;t seen any real difference yet as far as the anti-aging claims, but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to be a fair test.  But I primarily bought this as a moisturizer, and it absolutely does not even begin to work as that.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of the serum in Dec 2014. I feel my skin is pretty good recently. I used to buy Estee Lauder and now I stopped using that. I would like to try more of this product to see if I can get rid of Estee Lauder completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zhen</li>
    <li> I was completely surprised that  this serum contains all the ingredients that many anti-aging day or night creams contain.. It even has the necessary vitamins for aging skin. Unlike the creams, this serum is light, like most serums.  It feels light and is quickly absorbed. I didn&#x27;t feel as if I had anything on my face, it was absorbed so quickly with no stickiness of some serums. I will be 60 very soon.  I have never worn a heavy makeup look.  I applied this serum, a tinted sunblock and a bit of blush.  That&#x27;s it for an every day look.  Meanwhile, all the goodies in the serum are working to undo what damage was caused by living near a beach for several years. If you read the ingredients, you will have to agree.</li>
    <li> It has only been a few days of using the Atal anti-aging serum.  I love the smell and it is not sticky like other H. creams I have used in the past, so I am hoping this will work and only time will tell!!!!  The packaging and service was fantastic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months now (mostly morning and evening). LUV it!! Used sparingly I&#x27;ve still gotten great results. It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly into the skin, and leaves your face feeling soft.  I&#x27;ve noticed my dry patches aren&#x27;t as significant anymore. My 50 year old skin looks fresh and youthful! Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my review for the Atal Anti Aging Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* lightweight yet moisturized my skin&lt;br /&gt;*pleasent smell&lt;br /&gt;*did NOT break my skin out like a lesser quality product has in the past&lt;br /&gt;*quick &amp; easy to use&lt;br /&gt;* I loved the pump -you have more control over how much you use!&lt;br /&gt;*the packaging was pretty. It looks great on my shelf&lt;br /&gt;*quality ingredients&lt;br /&gt;*not tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely have enjoyed using this, twice daily, as part of my skincare routine. It feels luxurious. Easy to use and hydrates beautifully without being greasy. I recommend this product with two thumbs way up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Caring for my skin is important to me. I have been told I have amazing skin for my age. Yes, genetics and nutrition play a part in that, but I have also placed a high priority in caring for and nourishing my skin with products that optimise its appearance. Researching the ingredients that have been found to have the most favourable results in supporting heathy skin lead me to this serum. I was thrilled to find it contained the major ingredients in one concentrated serum which certainly simplifies my skin care routine. I have been extremely happy with the results so far. It is fine, silky smooth and non-greasy, leaving me with a noticeable feeling of plumping and hydrating of my skin. Even with very little required at each application I definitely am noticing subtle changes with fine lines during the last month of use. I look forward to seeing further results if what I have experienced thus far is any indication. I can highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Tha package came to Mexico without any problem. The cream is excelent. I saw progress since week 2.</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this item, but all opinions are my own. I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I really do love this product. My first impression was good. I love the way the bottle is. It is a pump action, which I like because it keeps germs and bacteria out of it and gives you the exact desired amount without waste. Secondly, I love the way it smells. I do not like strong scented lotions, especially face cream, so when I smelled this, I was in love. It is very lightly scented with almost a citrus smell yet so light you can hardly smell anything. Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a while, I like it even more. It goes on smoothly without that greasy or &amp;#34;caked-on&amp;#34; feel. It has all sorts of vitamins in it to make my face feel fresh, and to reduce wrinkles and other signs of age. I will most likely be getting more as soon as my bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. Since I have acne-prone skin, I have studied and read books to learn what type of products is suitable for me. It was a depressing trial &amp; error couple of years with horrible acne-flared face until I met my favorite products that I now use religiously.  I know exactly what ingredients I want so I look for products that only contains such with not too much additional unnecessary ones.  I came to this one, read the ingredients, and asked the seller about their background.  The creator is a biologist herself, with her extensive research and compilation of expertise on the field, they found the best combination for anti-aging serum. I love how the product is made to be vegan, gluten free, cruelty free and non toxic.  I try it out for the first time, the pump pushed out creamy lotion that&#x27;s more dense than I though because I thought serums are usually more liquidize. I then dab the cream equally to my forehead, both cheeks, nose, and chin. Using gentle hand strength, I circular the hand motion to massage the cream into my skin.  It absorbs pretty quickly, and made my skin really soft and moist. I like how it absorbs well into my skin, and did not cause any irritation, clog pores, or flare up any acne. The creamy texture is dense and packed with great ingredients that made my skin very smooth.  The pump is simple and dispense the product well into your hands with no leak or squirting out like some products do. I recommend steam your face with either a face steamer or a towel, pump one and a half of the cream into your fingers, dab it all over your face, and gently massage the products into your skin.  You will feel your face is smooth and glowy afterwards. I love the results so far!</li>
    <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
    <li> As a mature woman with sensitive skin, I have been delighted to find this new product not only makes my skin feel soft and hydrated, it does not cause any irritation which has been an issue for me with many products. It is particularly good as a primer for makeup, as it moisturises without being heavy or oily. Don&#x27;t hesitate to give Etal serum a try.</li>
    <li> Been using serum for a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; while...just wanted to check in and let you know how much I love this product! Just got out of the shower and what a huge difference I have notice in my color..smoothness... pore size..redness (which is gone)..fine lines..etc..I LOVE this serum!  Can&#x27;t wait to try the eye serum and see how that works too!! Keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> It is very good  so far, I think I need longer time to really be able to tell  how it works</li>
    <li> This serum feels amazing! You have to try it for yourself. Your skin will thank you!</li>
    <li> I reviewed this before also but it is not showing up anymore. I love this product. The texture is so smooth and makes my skin feel so soft. I have been using for quite some time now and it seems to have taken away all of the fine lines I had around my eyes. I still use this everyday and plan on continuing to do so. I am still on the first bottle totally worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am finding out I really like this product!  I use it every morning and at night before I go to bed.  The scent is really nice....light and citrus smelling.  My skin seems to soak it up!  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and goes on really smooth.  My skin tone seems to have become a bit better too!  The serum makes my skin feel softer and I&#x27;m noticing, after a little over a week of using it, my pores seem to be a bit smaller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a must in every women&#x27;s skin care collection!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve not had the eye serum very long, I can comment on ATAL&#x27;s level of customer service, which is exceptional.  They have sent me 3 email messages, two prior to receiving the product and another after I received it.  The eye serum was packaged extremely well wrapped securely inside bubble wrap.  I really like the way the product absorbs quickly into my skin and does not leave any residue, so my eyes are quickly ready to accept makeup.  I think I am really going to like the serum.  AND it is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this serum and will reorder more. Great texture, feel and smell, my skin just soaks it up and feels hydrated. Fast shipping is a plus.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - It did not negatively affect my product-sensitive skin at all (no breakouts or rash)&lt;br /&gt; - Very nice for a night cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - It honestly was a bit too much for my oily skin during the day.  By midday it was like my makeup became a creamy mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely wouldn&#x27;t say \\&quot;don&#x27;t buy this\\&quot;; if your skin is not super oily, then this product would be perfect.  I did have success in using it just at night, but unfortunately it was not a good day cream for me.</li>
    <li> good product. goes on easily. Have seen my skin is smooth</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a little over 2 weeks and really like how smooth my skin feels. I had hoped it would help in some other areas but have not seen the results I was hoping for. It&#x27;s a good product for hydrating the skin but for anti-aging so far (it has been only 2 weeks) I have not noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my skin feel supple. The product has a nice citrus smell. The product comes packaged well. There&#x27;s only 2 oz, but you only need a little.</li>
    <li> absorbs well and hydrates my skin</li>
    <li> I am 61 years old and a regular cyclist (cycling about 150 kms a week).  My age and my love of the outdoors, together with my naturally dry skin, mean I struggle to keep my skin adequately hydrated.  Also, I hate the after-feeling of lotions on my face and skin so I was sceptical about using Etal and that it would change my less-than-enthusiastic attitude to moisturising.  I was wrong.  It applies so very smoothly and is immediately absorbed – it takes little time to apply and is absorbed very quickly.  Also there is no greasy after-feel.  After a few days of daily application, my skin started to feel different – softer, and it even looked softer.  I would recommend it to those who hate the laborious and time-consuming routine of skin-care.  This product takes little time to apply and the positive effects are apparent after just a few days.</li>
    <li> This serum is top notch!  I was looking for something with peptides in it because I read an article that said the best anti-aging ingredient is peptides so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It has other high end ingredients that research has shown to work well but I was after the peptides (the matrixyl 3000 is yet another peptide!),  vitamin c, and hyaluronic acid.  This serum seriously has it all.  Ok, but does it work?  In my humble opinion it works excellent. I use it as a night cream and I have noticed a definite difference in my skin, especially at the corners of my eyes.  I am still using it and except to see even more results after a few more weeks.  I am really happy I bought this and am getting a bottle for my sister too.  I want to see how it works on her because she has a lot more sun damage than I do.  Will update my review with her results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also impressed at how good of a product this is for the price.  Generous sized bottle and beautiful packaging.  I think think I will ever buy my anti-aging products at a department store, or because it is a famous brand, ever again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I mean really love this product.  My skin feels smooth and just plain healthy.  I especially noticed a big difference in the morning. I wish I would have known about this for many years sooner but, I understand this was not available yet.  All I have to say now is better late then never.  I am so excited about this new anti aging serum that I will never need, use another one.  My best friend just saw me and she asked me what I have done.  I was glowing according to her.  Of course I let her know about Etal Serum.  My husband just a few nights ago just looked at me and said that I look really pretty at that moment.  Nothing special, he just said that.  Now to him I did not say a word.  I just said back...thanks hun.  Thank you Etal.  Sherri</li>
    <li> Seems to be working. Face is very soft and smooth. Small lines around the eyes are less so. Happy so far.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Light and non greasy...absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for over a week now and my skin is so soft and radiant!  People at work have even commented and asked what I have been using.  I would definitely recommend this serum to anyone that wants beautiful skin</li>
    <li> so far I like it! have only  used for 2 weeks</li>
    <li> UPDATE AFTER FIVE WEEKS OF USE:&lt;br /&gt;Just about the only claim this company DOESN&#x27;T make for its product is that it is noncomedogenic, though it does claim to be \\&quot;safe for all types of skin.\\&quot;  Not so. By the middle of the third week my face was breaking out (and at 60 I am not accustomed to breakouts); by the end of the fourth week my T-zone was a mess.  I kept on using it as Penny, the founder of this company, told me that I could not expect results in less than four weeks (though she tells another user that in 7 days she would see precisely the results I was hoping for).  This product doesn&#x27;t work for my sensitive skin and with continued use caused irritation and pimples.  I have no idea what in this cream is producing the problem; I have used Kinerase and Cellex-C for years with good results, but was hoping to find something less expensive that would work.  I will save this product for my hands, where it cannot really do any harm, and go back to my old (expensive) regimen.  It is worth it not to have these unfortunate results.  However, I must say that judging by the many good reviews this is not a common problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word to users: check out the individual ingredients for data on their effectiveness. There isn&#x27;t much real science there, and no double-blind studies I could find.  Also, some ingredients are downright questionable: e.g. the active ingredient of Renovage is a drug used in Japan for gastric ulcers but was rejected by the FDA for use in the United States.  But don&#x27;t take my word for it; do your own research.  It is very eye-opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW (3 stars):&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this product for two weeks, so perhaps the full effects have not manifested themselves as yet.  However, though it is an adequate moisturizer (though a bit heavy for delicate or sensitive skin) so far I have seen no changes in my skin.  At age 60 I look at most 40 (good genetics and a lifetime not spent tanning) and yet there are upcoming problems that I had hoped to eradicate -- small lines about the mouth are beginning to appear, as well as around the eyes, dark circles, and some blotchy patches around nose and chin.  No luck so far.  I am not losing hope, however, and will continue to use this product till it runs out to give it a fair chance.  Just be aware that two weeks may not be long enough for perceptible changes to take place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4 DAYS AFTER ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After posting this review I was contacted via email by someone claiming to be the founder of ATAL.  In her email she asked me to reword my review or remove it altogether because I had only given the serum three stars based on my initial 2 weeks of use, though ATAL itself had emailed me requesting my review.  I tried to respond to that person&#x27;s request but the email address provided by her was either bogus or invalid.  Be aware that this company only wants 5-star reviews.  Has anyone else out there been contacted with a request to rewrite or take down their review?  I am leery of doing business with a company that expects someone to remove a review that is less than perfect. The company&#x27;s representative said that \\&quot;bad\\&quot; reviews could hurt a new company, and that this was a valid reason not to give them 3 stars.  Go figure.-- small lines about the mouth are beginning to appear, as well as around the eyes, dark circles, and some blotchy patches around nose and chin.  No luck so far.

    <li> Thank you for a speedy delivery of a wonderful product. I am 63 years old and always looking for a good product that will help me look &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34;. This Anti Aging Face Serum makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. I wear it at night and in the morning before my makeup. I also apply in on my rough elbows and knees.  I have combination skin so part of my face is oily. I don&#x27;t feel my skin greasy after having the serum on all day long. At the end of the day I still feel fresh and clean. I also have sensitive skin and often with other products have skin irritation and redness throughout my cheeks. This Anti Aging Serum does not give me any irritation at all. It also has a very pleasant smell. Just a little dab of the cream goes a long way. I love this product. Looking forward to seeing more positive effects on my skin. Thanks again for a great product. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 79 so not expecting miracles, but I do enjoy this serum and think it does a nice job of moisturizing. Have been blessed with good skin; people generally guess I am in my 60s. My problem is more sag than wrinkle : / but I think this lives up to the \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; label if you don&#x27;t take the label too literally : )</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a youtube video by my favourite makeup artist / beauty guru Lisa Eldridge. She listed Haloxyl, Liquorice extract. So I did a quick amazon search, found this serum and ordered it immediately. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a couple of weeks and I can already see the difference. The wrinkles around my eyes have faded. I am using a couple of other eye creams containing Haloxyl (Kiehl&#x27;s and neutrogena, I&#x27;m a bit of a beauty magpie), the Nivea Q10 eye cream (I stock up when I go to europe) so no idea if it works best concurrently with other products or just by itself. I do think you need a moisturiser on top during the day, anything reasonably priced (i.e. the Nivea) will do.</li>
    <li> Love the serum. It does help.  What I didn&#x27;t appreciate was the price doubling between my first and second order</li>
    <li> I have been using the Atal lotion for about 2 weeks now and my face feels smooth,  I can already see the wrinkles around my eyes starting to smooth and my face feels moisturized all day without  feeling greasy.  I love the citrus smell and pump dispenser, the packaging is very attractive. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the ATAL Age Defying Face Serum! I was first impressed with the bottle &amp; packaging. The product looks like something you would get from a high end department store. It has a very light, almost citrusy scent. The serum is more like a cream or thick lotion. It absorbs quickly into the skin &amp; does not leave any greasiness behind. I have been using this twice a day for about 3 weeks now. I use one pump per application &amp; it looks like I&#x27;ve used just about a third of the bottle in the 3 weeks.  I am 46 and have been unhappy with the texture of my skin for a while. My skin has never looked better. My face is not only super soft, but very smooth, too. During this 3 week period, I decided to put apply some serum to the back of one of my hands so I could see the results when compared to my other hand. The biggest difference is that the hand that had the serum has smaller pores and much fewer lines. It really is amazing to see the results!</li>
    <li> I have been seeing more and more wrinkles lately, particularly under my chin and around my mouth.  I have been using this cream twice a day for three weeks and I have really seen an improvement!  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on your face, and it has a soft, pleasant smell.  When I first put it on, it leaves a kind of sticky feeling, but that goes away very quickly and my skin feels so soft afterward.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> When this arrived and I put it on for the first time I was hooked! It smells amazing and slides on smoothly. No greasy/oily residue and makes my skin radiant! I have had several comments over the last few weeks about my skin and I am so happy!! I will def be keeping this on my shelf !!</li>
    <li> I am seeing my wrinkles diminish and sun spots lighten.  I just ordered two more bottles!</li>
    <li> Atal anti aging face serum feels smooth and silky on my face and throat. I have used it twice daily since I received my order and though I can&#x27;t swear I look any younger I know of my face feels feels softer and has less fine wrinkles.  I really like the smell of citrus the serum has.</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous product and I have tried many!  I credit it with making great strides on getting rid of fine lines and even working on the deeper ones.  It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  At my age, the beauty regimen is lengthy, but this product helps tremendously and I love it!</li>
    <li> Best face cream I have ever purchased - ever! I wish I could give it another star.  I am reordering this week.  I have noticed a softening of skin and slight decrease of wrinkles around my eyes I have only been using for a couple of weeks.  I do apply twice per day.  It is not greasy and absorbs completely.  I should disclose I have also been using Biotin (supplement) which is for skin, hair and nails so it could be the impact of both products.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply - a little goes a long way.  You can see the difference who it refreshes your eyes after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few days and already love it! It has a soft citrus smell and soaks in very quickly. Not used it long enough for a huge difference but like the way it makes my skin look after applying it. It reminds me of Meaningful Beauty&#x27;s glow serum.</li>
    <li> This item was received as part of a promotion. I started using this product about 3 weeks ago and I can already notice the difference in my skins appearance. I have oily skin and other anti-aging products have clogged my pores leaving me with acne. At the age of 35, who has time for acne?? The non-greasy, lightweight, silky feel, creamy serum leaves my face soft and fresh with a healthy appearance. I even find it has even helped with my skin tone as well. It delivers great results!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> If there is any improvement in my skin, it&#x27;s too subtle to detect.  Not certain if it really helps.</li>
    <li> The Anti AgingSerum has a 5 star rateing for me,A good non greasy moisturiser ,My skin felt softer &amp; needed very little at each application.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for only a week now and I am impressed! I purchased this with a coupon and I think I will order again when I am out regardless if I have a coupon or not. I have this very deep crease in between my eyebrows. And with only one weeks usage I see it fading. I mean a real noticeable change. It is a wonderful moisturizer as well. It is light and non greasy. I use it along with my usual routine. I use an apple cider vinegar cleanser and then follow up with The ATAL serum. I do notice a full sensation right after sort of like my face is plump and lifted. I can&#x27;t wait till I have used it for a whole month. I wish I would have done before pictures so I could share with you all the obvious change.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these during the introductory price, wish I had bought more. Very moisturizing without being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my daughter, even after the intro price. Worth it..</li>
    <li> I was on the lookout for a replacement for my previous serum which was getting quite pricey.  The Atal serum has a very distinct scent that took some getting used to for me, but I am happy with the results so far.  It pumps out easily, goes on smoothly and my face feels soft and firm in the morning.  The directions say to apply twice a day, but I have only been using before bed and still like how my face feels in the morning.  I purchased this serum during a promotional period and am happy I gave it a try!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I like it. I normally have trouble finding moisturizers that work for my skin as I am very oily and acne prone. I was super excited to receive this at a discount because I am used to spending lots of money on products and many times they don&#x27;t agree with my skin. This serum has not caused me to have excess oil or feel greasy. It absorbs quickly into the skin. There is not much of a scent which is good for people who are sensitive. I also purchased the eye serum that goes with this and enjoy it as well!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so am always iffy about trying something new but I am so glad I grabbed this during a promotional period! It feels so great on my skin, is not heavy or greasy &amp; helps my makeup to go on smoothly &amp; still look good hours later. I love the silky feeling of this product when rubbing between my fingers &amp; applying to my face. It feels great going on &amp; has the slightest hint of a citrus smell which I find refreshing; diff than others I&#x27;ve used which smell too perfumey or just not pleasant. I do not have many wrinkles as of yet &amp; am hoping to prevent the occurrence of anymore by using this product...so far, so good. :) I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am realizing as I am getting a bit older now that my skin needs more attention. I received a coupon for this product, so I thought, hey, I will give it a try. WOW! It feels amazing on my face! I was a bit skeptical as I am kinda new to using facial products. This serum goes on so nicely and soaks in very quickly, not leaving my skin oily or shiny. I wear a sheer powder normally and have been noticing that my skin tends to dry out after wearing it for a few hours. But not when I use this! The serum lasts all day and my skin is actually glowing at the end of the day. I have been using it for the last 2 weeks now in the morning and (if I remember) at night. I haven&#x27;t seen a really big change yet on any fine lines, but I can tell that my skin texture and coloration seems to be balancing out. Total plus! Might not need that powder for much longer! I want to look into the other products from this company as I really love the effects I am getting from this one!</li>
    <li> I just received this Anti Aging Serum and have been using it about 3 weeks...I love the feel on my face not tacky at all and no smell.  My face feels soft and not greasy at all, when I work out I am able to easiliy sweat thru it and it does not run down my face. I also really like the container, I do alot of travrling and it is very compact and can be carried onboard--TSA--allowed.</li>
    <li> I see a difference on my fine lines</li>
    <li> I read most of the other reviews.  I have to agree with them.  It works!  My skin has improved.  No more dry patches, and my skin tone is more even.</li>
    <li> After this Serum reviews, i am losing faith in reviews.I have been using the serum religiously(2-3 times a day) for 12 days now but haven&#x27;t seen a sign of difference on my skin.Everyday, i clean my skin then apply and some times during the day when my skin feels dry then i apply again(as recommended).&lt;br /&gt;Before i bought i sent an email to ATAL , asking if your product is good for 62 years old woman.Also, asked if you have stronger serum for mature skin. Now, i know why never heard from them.</li>
    <li> Very nice product &#x3D;glowing, smooth skin!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum! I was looking for something to help my small forehead wrinkles that I recently noticed and the darkness around my eyes and this has already helped both issues. I use it in the morning and at night.  It leaves my skin feeling SO soft and smooth but NOT greasy which is a problem that I had with other serums in the past.  I aslo find that when using it in the mornings my make up goes on so much smoother than before. Overall my skin feels and looks healthier and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> For me this product is amazing. I use it twice a day and it goes on light, non greasy, no residue and dries almost instantaneously! I am 45 and don&#x27;t have any big problem areas yet. I do however have expression lines across my forehead and 2 fine lines between my eyebrows, but when I use this religiously I don&#x27;t even notice them, with or without makeup! I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this moisturizer.  Very rich and creaming does not have a greasy feeling.  Cannot say that I saw any changes in my skin, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Not even close to what I expected. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and there is no change in the look, texture or feel of my skin. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I got Atal&#x27;s Best Anti-Aging Serum for my fiancé and here is what she said:&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum. I have been putting it on before I go to sleep for the past couple weeks and also when I am fresh out of the shower. My skin feels fresh and clean when I wake up the next morning. It does not have a bad smell like creams I have tried in the past. It also makes me look/feel younger. I believe this product would be FABULOUS for anyone with dry skin or fair skin who gets wrinkles easy from the sun. If your skin is dry, you could put this on in the AM to feel fresh all day.</li>
    <li> Light weight and has caused no irritation on my sensitive skin. Excellent product</li>
    <li> I have only been using this serum for just over a week now. That said, I am noticing a subtle softening of wrinkles on my face. Yeah ! The scent is really lovely &amp; the serum is a nice texture. I love the natural ingredients in it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to write a review on this product after the first few days of use, but thought it would be better to give it more time to really see if my initial impression was accurate.  It was.  I&#x27;m in love with this lotion, and with my skin! I&#x27;m a single, almost 40 year old mom, and taking care of myself is often on the bottom of an ever-growing list of responsibilities.  But I&#x27;d been noticing how dull and old my face was looking.  40 is by no means &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; so I was pretty unhappy with what was happening.  I decided to splurge on some new face care products, and read some pretty great reiews on this one.  Amazon Prime had my delivery here in two days.  (I LOVE Amazon!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes boxed, in a nice glass bottle with a pump dispenser.  The consistency is fairly creamy white lotion, without appearing to be too heavy.  If it has any scent, it&#x27;s light and pleasant, but I really don&#x27;t think it has any fragrance.  The description says &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; but most other serum I&#x27;ve used are much more liquidy while this is more like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it that night and noticed immediately that it wasn&#x27;t greasy, or too heavy, and soaked into my skin wonderfully.  I don&#x27;t have dry skin, just dull and uneven looking with fine lines at my eyes and laugh lines emerging near my mouth.  I know I need a heavy duty moisturizer, but I absolutely HATE the heavy greasy feeling ones that are targeted for anti-aging skin care.  I used it again the next morning before makeup, and was pleased again with how well it soaked in quickly.  My makeup looked great all day, with no excess shine or shifting.  Same routine and results all that week.  I usually skip makeup on the weekends, so I see my natural face all day.  That next weekend, I really noticed a difference.  My face felt hydrated, plumper, fewer noticeable splotches of uneven color, just all around healthier.  After a month of using it, I definitely notice a difference in the appearance of my wrinkles and creases. This is by no means some magic youth potion, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, better look elsewhere.  But if you are looking for better skin tone, texture, and hydration, give this a try.  No breakouts, no heavy slick feeling.  Just glowing skin that certain looks younger and healthier every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that the bottle is opaque white, so I can&#x27;t see how much is left! I want to reorder before I run out! Otherwise, I have no complaints and will have this as a permanent addition to my skin care routine for as long as I can get it!s.

    <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer that is oil free and absorbs quickly.  The ingredients are fantastic for your skin; they are naturally derived ingredients.  I also apply an additional face lotion with SPF protection in the mornings.  Great price for a quality moisturizer.  Thanks Atal!</li>
    <li> This product seems to keep my wrinkles from getting worse and slightly improved. This is the second bottle I have used and I hope&lt;br /&gt;there will be even more improvement. I am in my late 60s so I am not expecting a miracle.</li>
    <li> This serum feels good on the skin and is absorbed well.</li>
    <li> This product is worth every penny just after a few days i can see a difference in my skin, love it</li>
    <li> Definitely, it absorbed quick in to skin and made my skin more softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t see much of effect on my brown spots yet.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I have to put cream or oil on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. I love using it.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews, but I absolutely love this product.    Some of the smaller lines around my eyes and mouth are gone,  lines are less noticeable, my skin looks and feels better. I&#x27;m a fan, wish they had auto shipment.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this serum. I have been using it for about three weeks, and it has already helped. I feel like my face hasn&#x27;t looked better since my third pregnancy, which threw my face into a hormonal wreck. This serum has greatly reduced the appearance of my breakouts. I&#x27;ve noticed in pictures that my faced looks so much more smooth with a healthy glow. It never feels greasy. I don&#x27;t use any makeup except for mascara, so it&#x27;s important to me to find a great product to apply after I wash my face. This is definitely a winner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m such a skeptic when it comes to products...ESPECIALLY so when it&#x27;s personal care. I don&#x27;t believe claims of this potion or that chiseling years off your face and don&#x27;t fall prey to all the hype. I decided to give this a try as the reviews look positive and the company looks solid. Let me tell you what I&#x27;ve noticed with this product after two weeks/twice a day usage...&lt;br /&gt;1. Smoother skin that feels and appears hydrated. I have combated dry skin on my face since I can remember. The flakiness on my face is gone. Literally, completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have to be careful with ANYTHING I use on my face, as I will inevitably have a reaction as my skin is sensitive. My skin has had no adverse reactions to applying Atal..no redness, no increased dryness, no breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;3. The light, luscious natural smell (slightly reminds me of  orange zest). Just mentioning that there isn&#x27;t a chemical or perfume type of smell to this product, which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;4. While I&#x27;m not completely certain of a difference in my fine lines (as of yet), I HAVE noticed a change in the three chicken pox marks I have on my face from my adult onset of chicken pox. I am not kidding....all three of them look smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, where I&#x27;m at with this product, (besides loving it!) is that, even if it doesn&#x27;t fade my fine lines I really don&#x27;t care as I&#x27;m at peace with what God gave me and what I&#x27;m working with, BUT...I love how my skin has been responding to Atal. Obviously it&#x27;s happier with it than without!</li>
    <li> 1 pump is really enough for both eyes...I even have a little left for my forehead. The product is very light and absorbs easily. In less than 2 weeks, all the puffiness under my eyes is gone. This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve used that actually lives up to its marketing and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. Plus the price is great; I use it twice a day and still think 1 bottle will last at least several months.</li>
    <li> Lightweight serum that moisturizes for hours. Beautifully packaged!</li>
    <li> Very nice! Excellent.</li>
    <li> This is the best Serum I have ever used, fast drying, but keeps my face moisturized and I can already see a noticeable difference!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for two weeks and am already seeing great results. My skin feels smooth and hydrated all day and my makeup is still in place at the end of the day. I have sensitive skin prone to acne breakouts and dry patches so I am always nervous about trying new products, however I have reached an age where I feel I need to start using anti-ageing products and after doing some research and reading about this serum I decided to give it a go. I am so pleased with the results so far and my skin has had no reactions, yay! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I love the fact that it had no nasty ingredients and it is a very reasonable price for a product of this standard.</li>
    <li> I want to give this stuff 6, 7, 10, 100 stars!  I&#x27;ve been trying different anti-aging/anti-wrinkle products to see what works best for me and this product is hands down, the best.  With other creams and serums I&#x27;ve noticed slight improvements, better conditioned skin.  But this stuff, I actually see more distinct improvement.  After just a couple of weeks I noticed that my skin felt younger and I really did notice that fine lines were disappearing.  I love looking in the mirror and looking younger.  And I would add that my beauty has taken a hit with having two young kids, lack of sleep and lack of overall taking the care I should for myself.  This is my miracle serum!  I&#x27;m so happy to look more like I did - pre kids!</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised by this.  Love the texture, my skin just drinks it in.  Nice smell and I&#x27;ve been using it instead of my more &amp;#34;expensive department store products.  Would definately purchase again.  No problems with breakouts and seems to smooth out my expression lines nicely!  Great for under makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this ~ It goes on light and smooth ~ not greasy and has no odor to it which is a great plus for me. I think the packaging is really cool and the top actually stays on ~ I normally throw them away bc they don&#x27;t stay on.  It makes my skin feel god and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out! Yay!</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this product, did not like this under my mineral makeup, left me feeling greasy.... will pass it along to my husband.</li>
    <li> Best face serum I have ever used, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff !! It really delivers results on tightening. And the fragrance is refreshing. I will definitely buy more of this.</li>
    <li> I have to write a review about this awesome face serum... It really, really works! I begin using it about 2 weeks ago and I believe I see a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes. Oh and did I mention it smells wonderful, like citrus. I especially love ATAL after I wash my face at night, my face feels so soothed and soft. I will defiantly be a repeat customer. Thank You ATAL face Serum!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a short time, but already notice a difference in the texture and appearance of my skin.  My face is clearer and the pores seem more refined.  I like the finish it leaves on my skin.  It hydrates without being sticky or feeling greasy.  The serum has a pleasant and unobtrusive fragrance and applies smoothly.  So far, so good!  I will update my review in a few weeks but, after using the product for only two weeks, I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my wrinkles.  The odor was pleasant and it was light.  I wanted so badly for this to work, but it&#x27;s basically just lotion as far as I&#x27;m concerned and it&#x27;s a little pricy for that.</li>
    <li> Skin looks good. Improvement in texture and decrease in fine lines around eyes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the feel of this cream. I usually use a vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum which is very drying but firming. I then have to follow with moisturizer and eye cream. This product has many additional ingredients that leave my face feeling moisturized but not greasy. I&#x27;m not getting the shine that I was by afternoon. What I love the most is it&#x27;s only one step and your done. I highly recommend this product for those with oily skin like myself. For me, it has balance that I&#x27;ve been hard pressed to find. The packaging is also beautiful. The pump dispenses just the right amount so that you don&#x27;t waste and the 1.5 oz size will last a long time making the price much more economical than it looks like on the surface. Thank you for the opportunity to try this wonderful product at a discounted price to test as a consumer.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good about this Anti  Face Serum.  For all the compliments I keep getting from family and friends it amazes me.  Just using it in the a.m  and then again in the p.m is a real reward to me. I look forward on going out and looking so good.  My face is just glowing from the results of this product.  Buying it makes me feel good to spend the money on an excellent product.  Never hesitate to order it from Amazon.  Dotsy</li>
    <li> I have notices a slight difference</li>
    <li> Really like this product &amp; is working</li>
    <li> I have been having less random breakouts. My skin is smoother and brighter and more even. The smell is very light and pleasant. It&#x27;s light and non-greasy. Very pleased</li>
    <li> What I like most about this product compared to other anti aging products is, it  goes on creamy and spreads easily. A small amount will cover my entire face and neck.  When I first started using this product, I thought it was going to leave a heavy night cream feel. It does not, within about 5 minutes it absorbs into the skin leaving it soft feeling. I also have noticed it does not clog my pores like some of the other products I have used that do even though they are not suppose to.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in wrinkles. I have only been using it about 3 weeks though.  I feel it takes much longer, around 6 months for any product to show results in wrinkle reduction.  Even then, that is a tall order. What I look for at my age is no new lines to appear.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have been very satisfied with how smooth this product has left my skin feeling.  When I first started using the product, I was applying twice daily as directed.  I have an oily skin type, so I had to back off to once daily (specifically in the evenings).  That was the best solution for me anyways.</li>
    <li> Smells good and seems to firm my skin well. I need to use a moisturizer over it but I think that is normal. I ahve only been using it for a few weeks but it seems like a good addition to my skin care.</li>
    <li> Love how it made my skin feel and that it didnt break out since I have very senitve skin</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Does a good job for less bucks. I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up. Works!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of the product; now just waiting to see results. Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know yet.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a short time. Etal is very light and creamy and absorbs into your skin fast.  A small amount goes far. I have noticed slight lifting of my lower cheeks  as well as my face appears brighter and firmer. The area around my eyes show improvement. I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I am amazed that there are some many good ingredients for such a reasonable price.  My skin is much softer and smoother after using this for just a few weeks</li>
    <li> I have bought this product twice already.  I do think I see improvements to my skin&#x27;s texture and appearance.  It moisturizes nicely and doesn&#x27;t have an odor (which I really like).  These products are very reasonably priced so they&#x27;re affordable for just about everyone.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> ATAL Premium Anti Aging Face Serum is very nice and I think adds moisture which all skin needs. I top this serum with a very rich and heavy moisturizer and the two work well together.</li>
    <li> No visible results yet, it&#x27;s been only a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> Finally something that works. I have to disclose that I got a deal on this premium anti aging face serum, for my HONEST review. So here I go. It does work and I also bought the eye serum and wow my mother noticed the difference and she sees me everyday. I will not ever run out of this.</li>
    <li> the cream is nice. For my dry skin I could use more moisture since my skin will take it all in and makeup application will not look good. Am using this in conjunction with a vitamin c serum and have definitely seen wrinkles disappearing.</li>
    <li> A fantastic serum that I have loved using. Works really well under make up and helped it stay on throughout the day. I really like the formulation. The serum goes into the skin without making your skin greasy. It has helped to diminish fine lines and improve my skin tone. After using the eye cream and serum for a while now, I have started to use a much lighter foundation because I am not longer trying to &#x27;mask&#x27; my skin. Definitely will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m highly impressed with this product, and have been since week one. Noticeable difference with fine lines very quickly. I am very fair and concerned with aging, and my skin can be quite dry to oily during the day. At the first use I noticed my skin more adequately hydrated with out being oily.  At week one I can really see a difference in fine lines around my eyes and forehead. It is almost a month since I started using this product and can now see a big difference in the deeper laugh lines around my mouth and have noticed my pores looking so much better. I am a product junkie, and feel like this one is head and shoulders above any others I can think of. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Etal for about a month.  I absolutely love this serum!  It&#x27;s evened out my overall skin tone and my smile lines have all but disappeared!  I&#x27;ve used so many products and have half bottles sitting all over my bathroom.  Not Etal!  I was just getting ready to recorder and noticed it might take awhile to get.  I also noticed the name change...I&#x27;ve asked about it.  Sure hope the product hasn&#x27;t changed.  I have been highly recommending this to friends and will be continuing to buy it myself.  This works!!</li>
    <li> I am giving this 5 stars now even though I have only been using it for less than a week, my skin feels amazing.  I noticed the difference the following morning after my first use and it continues to amaze me.  I&#x27;ll be back to add to this once I&#x27;ve used it long enough to notice the other benefits.  I&#x27;m so excited,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s going on one week since I bought this product.  My skin looks amazing. It&#x27;s clearer, more plump and moisturized, radiant, and blemish free. Already it looks like 5 years or more were taken off. Im very, very pleased.</li>
    <li> After using this twice a day for a few weeks my face and neck I feel and look better. This seems to work like magic and erase some of the fine lines on my face. I noticed it most between my eyes. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. I was able to buy this during a promotion, so I was happy to give it a try. The texture of it is nice. It is a cream serum rather then the more slippery(?) type.I like how it keeps my face nice and moisturized all day, when combined with my face lotion. It really does make a nice difference. I like this brand, an I am happy to make it part of my daily routine!</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this product during a promotional period and I&#x27;m in love with it!!! I&#x27;m so happy that after years of either crazy expensive products or cheaper products that either didn&#x27;t work or left my face feeling heavy I&#x27;ve found my new skin care line!!! This serum is light and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling weighed down, on the contrary my skin feels refreshed and invigorated!! And the light clean citrus scent is nice but not over powering at all. I&#x27;ve only just started using this and the Premium Eye Serum but I surely will continue since my face feels so nice!!!</li>
    <li> my wife started seeing results in less than 1 month &amp; highly recommends it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now. I was extremely lucky to be part of a promotional group to test it out. My poor face has been needing some nourishment in these winter months. This serum was just what I needed. It has such a silky texture to it and this refreshing citrus smell. It glides on my skin. I use it morning and night after cleansing my face. It helps my face to feel moisturized and refreshed. I am already noticing that my face is beginning to grab that youthful look back. I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it to see bigger and more lasting results!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for weeks &amp; honestly I&#x27;m impressed.  I was so happy to get this product with a coupon &amp; was eager to give it a try.  I am in my late 30&#x27;s, mom of 3, with very sensitive skin.  I suffer from eczema &amp; milia.  Many products on the market are too harsh for me &amp; simply leave me red &amp; blotchy.  T&lt;br /&gt;First off this product smells great!  It goes on very smooth &amp; soft &amp; doesn&#x27;t fe harsh at all.  Since using it I have had zero outbreaks of eczema on my face &amp; no milia either.  My skin feels smoother &amp; softer &amp; I&#x27;ve also noticed a decrease in my fine lines.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> It feels silky and smooth on the skin reducing that tight feeling that can exist around the eyes without resorting to a facial moisturiser and separate eye serum. The light scent of orange is delicious and appeals to my husband just as much as it does to me...this is a first in our house!&lt;br /&gt;Such a small amount of serum is required to give that feeling of moisture infusion into the skin without greasy residue for an effect that lasts all day. Great job Etal.</li>
    <li> I have the ATAL eye serum and use it daily so when I was offered this as a promotional deal I was excited to try it. This is as equally awesome as the eye cream. I love the pump dispenser, it doesn&#x27;t get clogged up and delivers the perfect amount of product. Often face creams leave me greasy and don&#x27;t ever seem to totally sink into my skin, but this doesn&#x27;t make my face feel all sticky or greasy after using it at all. My sensitive skin doesnt always react well to anti aging creams, I am super pale and am prone to redness but I would totally recommend this to someone with similar sensitivities. the ATAL brand is my new favorite for sure.</li>
    <li> It actually does work and incredibly well. I ran out of it because I was putting it on 4x a day so I ordered more! For men it is hard to find something that deals with dark circles and there&#x27;s no way to eliminate them completely, but mine are definitely much lighter and smaller now.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product.  The first thing I have noticed is the cream hose on smoothly and leaves my skin very soft.  Hopefully this will lead to reduced fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Great product, great packaging, very please.</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews on this Advanced Anti Aging Serum, but I&#x27;m not seeing the results that others said they have been getting.  I still have all the same lines in my crow feet area.  I also used it around my mouth like some of the other posts said they did, and...nothing.  I&#x27;m really not satisfied with this serum.  I feel I&#x27;ve wasted my money, once again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only two weeks twice a day for wrinkles under my chin which is a tough area to treat. This product is a good moisturizer therefore I&#x27;m hoping with continued use I will see the results I&#x27;m looking for. Company offers 100% guarantee which is great. Ladies and gents, you should use this product before you get wrinkles to keep from getting them. I have sensitive skin and this products works well on my skin.</li>
    <li> the packaging itself is impressive, handy so you can just put them in your purse that easy for like if you are going out for a vacation. i love the cap.&lt;br /&gt;the scent and the texture is very smooth. and oh! i got this from a discounted price so that made me even love this product!</li>
    <li> Did not see any result... Disappointed...</li>
    <li> The serum is pure quality. You only need a tiny amount. This is my first time using ATAL products, but would definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week now.  My pores seem to be less visible.  As far as wrinkles go, not sure about that just yet.  I will repost if and when that improves.  My skin does feel soft in the morning.</li>
    <li> Great serum! I&#x27;ve been using it every day for 2 weeks and the texture of my skin has visibly improved. The serum is a good consistency and has a yummy citrus smell. Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a little over a week ago and I am so glad I did.  I immediately noticed a reduction in the size of my pores and my face appears to be much more radiant.  I love this product and just reordered so that I will have more when I finish the first container.  I might add that I have been using much more expensive products which have not rendered these results.</li>
    <li> Overall a great product if used on a clean-washed face.  The first time I used it, I applied it right after using my face cleaning pads (different product) and it wasn&#x27;t good; the combination made clumps.  However, like I said, if used on a clean-washed face it&#x27;s great. Once applied it absorbs quickly, is non greasy and leaves my face feeling very smooth.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference.  I personally think it is over rated and overed priced.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to know if it will have the benefits advertised, but at least it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like so many other products.  I&#x27;ll have to use it for a while before I can be sure it is for me.</li>
    <li> Received early, very pleased</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see much effect.</li>
    <li> ATAL works for me!  I was rather leery of trying (yet another) skin serum.  I had been using Grekin products but they are hard to get, and very expensive (can only get at Skin Clinic).  I am so glad I tried ATAL.  It sinks into my skin, instead of sitting on top, and is not at all greasy.  At first, it seems like it &amp;#34;isn&#x27;t doing anything&amp;#34;......but after a few days use, I can definitely see improvement in my skin.  The texture and color (no splotchy areas) are very much evened out, my skin just feels healthy and smooth.  I got much more than I hoped for from ATAL, I will order again.  Great customer service, too.  Oh.....did I mention it is very reasonably priced??????</li>
</ol>
