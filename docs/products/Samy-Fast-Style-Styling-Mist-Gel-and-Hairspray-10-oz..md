    <li> Best product ever. Love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> SUPER PRODUCT, WORKS WONDERS FOR YOUR STYLING, FAST DELIVERY</li>
    <li> great product  use it all the time  I use all of Sammy products fresh great job you should buy it</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it.  It is a gel and hairspray in one.  You can add volume to your style or make it piecey.  It&#x27;s great.  It has become difficult to find in stores so, it&#x27;s great to be able to order it online!</li>
    <li> I  am very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Great product as always.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Time saver.</li>
    <li> This product holds, but I&#x27;m just not a fan of hairspray overall, and it didn&#x27;t make me think I wanted to use it all the time, so I only gave it a 4.</li>
    <li> Does not leave your hair feeling heavy .  It hold the style , and you can still run your fingers through your hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect a compliment to Samy Get Curls.  When my hair has Get Curls and is almost dry, I use this mist.  No frizz whatsoever.  It holds, but not stiff.</li>
    <li> Samy hair spray is my, above all others. favorite.  Just the right amount of hold with no build-up, that&#x27;s important. I have tried several Samy products and like all of them.</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  It doesn&#x27;t dull your hair and gives great body without the stiffness of other sprays. I have fine, thinning grey hair.  I tip my head forward, give it a light spray, then lift my head and with my hair pick lightly set it in place. One of the clerks at Walgreens recommended it but I can never find it there any more.  So glad I was able to find it at Amazon</li>
    <li> It really helps us style our hair.  My friend in Georgia intorduced it to me.  Now both or us use it.  Wonderful</li>
    <li> Glad I can still get this online  cannot find in stores anymore  I have used for 3 or 4 years now and love it</li>
    <li> Use this all the time and absolutely love.  It is a great product and one that I use constantly.  Would recommend for anyone who just wants to put a soft mist to hold and style their hair.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray ever and I have tried many over the years!</li>
    <li> Love Samy products, works great on stubborn hair. Will always reorder. Love the hair spray also. Good for the price</li>
    <li> make it cheaper please</li>
    <li> I have used product previously, and am very pleased with it; but did not receive free gift.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this item at Walgreen&#x27;s but they discontinued it.  I have very short hair and this&lt;br /&gt;product is wonderful.  So glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Use it on wet and dry hair.  It isn&#x27;t sticky feeling like most hairs sprays are.  Wish I could find it in a store where I live</li>
    <li> Favorite hair product of all time. I spray it on my baby fine hair, scrunch it, and then style. The volume and hold you get is remarkable. It is so great to be able to spray on clean dry hair without using gels or mousse that don&#x27;t hold my hair at all. I only use one styling product now. This product is a money and time saver but best of all I can count on it working every time I use it.</li>
