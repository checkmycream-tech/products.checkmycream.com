      <li>I love that is</li>
      <li>but this is even better.  </li>
      <li>It seems like he didn&#x27;t lose any more hair while using it (thus the three stars)</li>
      <li>I seem some hair but still have 2 more bottles to go before I will see what the results are,</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and good price.</li>
      <li>will buy another bottle and continue to use because it is so easy to use, and hope for results as time goes on.</li>
      <li>hi, so i bought the serum thinking that i will fine</li>
      <li>Tried it for a week and had a huge break out allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>Hairline has filled in as well.</li>
      <li>That alone is important to me.  </li>
      <li>I seem to be getting good results in the 1 month I&#x27;ve been using it so far.  </li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Just used up the first bottle and have 2 more to go.  </li>
      <li>And you never get your money back from any of these kind of products!</li>
      <li>Overall, Hair fall has been arrested, that&#x27;s a good sign</li>
      <li>around 8 months for full results.</li>
      <li>apart from it making my hair slightly greasy, it is pleasant smelling and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The product is easy to apply and there is no problem with burning and scarring of my scalp which I have experienced with Minoxidil in the past.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product, along with Nizoral shampoo, for a little over almost two months and am very happy with the results so far.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the product for nearly a week, and what I like the most is the fact that it does not make my hair oily.</li>
      <li>Not crazy about the dispenser, so I use another one.</li>
      <li>This one is worth writing about.</li>
      <li>, worth trying one.</li>
      <li>I do not see that the thin/bald spots have started new growth yet but realize it could take months to stimulate growth and am willing to give the product a few more months to see if it is successful.</li>
      <li>I am also using a shampoo and conditioner that I believe is contributing to the positive results!</li>
      <li>I have had good results so far with the Hairomega oral suppliments, so when they came out with a topical serum I jumped at the opportunity.  </li>
      <li>do not know if I will see results as I am only able to use it for about three days per week</li>
      <li>Forget about  new hair, my sink is full  of  hair.</li>
      <li>Good stuff for weakening hair though must use in combination with other products and have a healthy ACTIVE LIFESTYLE....</li>
      <li>Total  waste  of money, time  and more importantly  hair..!!</li>
      <li>and in the long run is cheaper and more convenient than paying shipping fees and waiting for this product to arrive.  </li>
      <li>I just have to wait and see if it does work on my very particular scalp.</li>
      <li>My hair has stopped falling out in large amounts.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t see my whole scalp when I style my hair up now.</li>
      <li>it really did not work for me.</li>
      <li>Much easier to apply than the liquid.</li>
      <li>It really works, it just takes time.</li>
      <li>My husband didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
      <li>I have used it for one month and the area that I was trying to get hair to grown, I do have some growth, about half an inch of new hair, so it seems to have done the job, the problem is that this is an on going event, to keep this littler bit of hair to stay and grow more., but it is certainly worth it,</li>
      <li>I also use many other volumizing products and hair , skin and nail vitamins.  </li>
      <li>My bangs have filled out, an there is all new growth in the formerly bald patches on both sides of my bangs.  </li>
      <li>Took a while to start showing results (3-4 months), but with consistent use, the hair loss has almost completely stopped.  </li>
      <li>I have started to see all the new hair growth, so it is working!</li>
      <li>Use it as twice a day and new hair will start coming in!</li>
      <li>I am 24 and my hairline has started to rapidly recede over the past year, I was worried because many forums said that this hair would never regrow or would only grow fine hairs.</li>
      <li>Works much better than the &#x27;regular strength&#x27; generic minoxidil</li>
      <li>Has shown improvement in new hair growth.</li>
      <li>New growth and thicker hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I am not thrilled with it.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this because it had a foam but found this formula left the hair very greasy and as someone with curly hair</li>
      <li>Working well so far.</li>
      <li>I have used this product since Dec. 5, 2012, I bought 2 bottles so far....</li>
      <li>A bought this for my older brother who has been experiencing hair loss for the last 5 years.</li>
      <li>Its too early to give concrete conmment on the same.</li>
      <li>apparently the foam is easier to apply and stays on longer and is not messy like the dropper.</li>
      <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
      <li>It takes much longer to dry the hair in the area</li>
      <li>The first thing you have to understand when dealing with this or any other hair loss product is that they are not miracle drugs.</li>
      <li>It came on time and exactly what I expected!</li>
      <li>i am a guy 26 year old, not bald but really thin hair, i will try the regular minoxidil without that many stuff , will c how it works...</li>
      <li>and I like it better than the drops because it&#x27;s less messy.</li>
      <li>and I like it better than the drops because it&#x27;s less messy</li>
      <li>But in reality I don&#x27;t think those added ingredients do that much to help you other than  psychologically and the over the counter minox foam</li>
      <li>It came back completely white, but we kept on using it and it turned back to his natural hair color, black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has helped my hair grow back in the front behind my hairline and on my sides. I love that is doesnt leave my hair sticky.  It absorbs well when I rub it into my scalp and I am able to style my hair afterwards.</li>
    <li> Total  waste  of money, time  and more importantly  hair..!! I&#x27;ve been using this useless  product for almost months now. Forget about  new hair, my sink is full  of  hair.Will never  ever  try this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me used for 2 mos</li>
    <li> I am in my third month using this product.  I have started to see all the new hair growth, so it is working!</li>
    <li> This product is adv as enough for approx two months , but is not going to last a month .So I will look for another product that is longer lasting for the same money. As far as the effectiveness ; it has not been used long enough to produce regrowth from the info given on the bottle. Only time will tell , but like I said I don&#x27;t have enough for two months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it had a foam but found this formula left the hair very greasy and as someone with curly hair I do not wash my hair daily leaving this product unused by me.</li>
    <li> The first thing you have to understand when dealing with this or any other hair loss product is that they are not miracle drugs. At best they can help you maintain the hair you already have.  Or maybe grow in some tiny baby hairs.  So that being said, the product delivers in that aspect.  However it&#x27;s suppose to be a foam and unfortunately its a very weak foam that starts dripping and running down the side of my face faster than the liquid minox.  And this causes the side of my face to itch where the product leaked.  I also got this product because it was a lot cheaper than a compound that I was buying from a so called Hair Loss Doctor and because of it&#x27;s added ingredients.  But in reality I don&#x27;t think those added ingredients do that much to help you other than  psychologically and the over the counter minox foam actually does foam and in the long run is cheaper and more convenient than paying shipping fees and waiting for this product to arrive.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will order this again, it&#x27;s overall a pretty mediocre product, but let&#x27;s face it, as all of us hair loss suffers know, minoxidil is just mediocre period, what can you do.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say if this works, or  not.  It&#x27;s only been a month and it should take longer for results.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for weakening hair though must use in combination with other products and have a healthy ACTIVE LIFESTYLE....so get this instead of mousse if your losing hair</li>
    <li> Pasty sticky mess that doesn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t believe that hype, you have better odds with a scratch rucket than with this stuff</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair stop falling out immediately.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good price. Pleasant smell. I used this with my derma roller and I have never had my head itch so severely. It was horrible. Alone the product did not cause itching.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and was well packed. I have been using it for a few weeks and apart from it making my hair slightly greasy, it is pleasant smelling and easy to apply. Packaging is discreet and the pump functions well.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if I will see results as I am only able to use it for about three days per week - it simply makes my hair too greasy. I think it would be an excellent product if you could use it as directed.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have been using the product for nearly a week, and what I like the most is the fact that it does not make my hair oily. I just have to wait and see if it does work on my very particular scalp.</li>
    <li> Perfect for women with sensitive scalps. My hair has stopped falling out in large amounts. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and the results.</li>
    <li> Product is VERY easy to use, and goes on easier and better than Rogaine.&lt;br /&gt;No foul smell, and unlike Rogaine does not leave your hair and scalp dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for 3 months however and have noticed no hair growth at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another bottle and continue to use because it is so easy to use, and hope for results as time goes on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I am not thrilled with it.  It takes much longer to dry the hair in the area it&#x27;s applied to (front) and tends to make my hair stringy looking.  I do like the application bottle.  But I don&#x27;t like having to use it twice daily, especially at night when I&#x27;m usually quite tired.  I was using Rogaine Foam for Women, which is a once-a-day application and far more expensive, but will probably go back to it.</li>
    <li> It came on time and exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> Just used up the first bottle and have 2 more to go.  I seem some hair but still have 2 more bottles to go before I will see what the results are,</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of the foam. I thought I would be. It just seem not to get on my scalp as well as the dropper. I cannot maneuver it through my hair. But it seem to have help with hair growth and reduce shedding.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all. Not purchasing again. Maybe it would work for others...just not for me. Hair loss is so tricky.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I have been using Rogaine but this is even better.  Works just as well keeping the hair thicker but is also a styling aid - my hair has more body!</li>
    <li> Works much better than the &#x27;regular strength&#x27; generic minoxidil I was using previously.  Saw results within a couple of weeks!</li>
    <li> I just love it,my hands are like silk</li>
    <li> apparently the foam is easier to apply and stays on longer and is not messy like the dropper. Furthermore, it seems to work better, according to my wife. just bought another one but could not get it delivered since Amazon now uses USPS delivery and that is been an issue. Otherwise, all is well.</li>
    <li> Having been using this for about a year as my hair on the forepart of my head was thinning.  New growth and thicker hair.  Even my hair dresser commented on the change.  Works better than Rogaine for Women.</li>
    <li> Did not notice a different with this product or a generic lower priced minoxidil product. The active ingredient is the same, and the other extra ingredients are just to hype up the marketing.</li>
    <li> Tried it for a week and had a huge break out allergic reaction. I am bummed I can;t use it!</li>
    <li> excellent excellent product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> Less than half the strength of Kirkland&#x27;s foam monoxidil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months.  It took about 4 months to start showing improvement, the excessive hair loss has stopped, and there is new growth now all along my hairline in front.  My bangs have filled out, an there is all new growth in the formerly bald patches on both sides of my bangs.  About 4 months ago I added the Dietary supplements, and the growth has accelerated.  The downside is that you have to apply the foam twice a day, it gets a little tiresome to have to do this every day, but it&#x27;s still worth it to me.  Just be patient, it takes a while.</li>
    <li> Has shown improvement in new hair growth.</li>
    <li> A bought this for my older brother who has been experiencing hair loss for the last 5 years. He had tried many products to no avail . This product has done unbelievable wonders . Recommended.</li>
    <li> it really did not work for me. I tried twice..</li>
    <li> Great product!!  I could see results after one bottle.  Will continue using it to keep the front of my scalp from thinning.</li>
    <li> I think this item was working to regrow hair, but I didn&#x27;t care for the foam.  I only used this product for 30 days that then switched to a product that was not foam.</li>
    <li> Love the foam application.  Working well so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of months for my hairline. I&#x27;m just starting to see results and I&#x27;m quite pleased. You have to be patient when using this product. It is very easy to use. The application process takes less than a minute. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the foam-would prefer a liquid with a narrow tip to apply easier directly to the scalp.  Even with my head upside down, half of the product goes in my hair.  Even if I dry my hair after application, it leaves it with a greasy like residue.  I am on my second bottle of the product.  I do not see that the thin/bald spots have started new growth yet but realize it could take months to stimulate growth and am willing to give the product a few more months to see if it is successful.</li>
    <li> Item left me with redness and itchy scalp- now i&#x27;m having issues returning it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!!! My husband got alopecia from stress and lost most all of his hair, including eyebrows. He looked like a zebra. I bought Hairomega serum and used it on him for four weeks and his hair came back. It came back completely white, but we kept on using it and it turned back to his natural hair color, black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will always be my product of choice in the future.</li>
    <li> Good for my hear it helpful</li>
    <li> It makes the top of your head gooey.  The spray is much better.</li>
    <li> I have used it for one month and the area that I was trying to get hair to grown, I do have some growth, about half an inch of new hair, so it seems to have done the job, the problem is that this is an on going event, to keep this littler bit of hair to stay and grow more., but it is certainly worth it,</li>
    <li> After 4 months of use I can now see moderate growth. It works well and I like it better than the drops because it&#x27;s less messy</li>
    <li> hi, so i bought the serum thinking that i will fine beacause its only 2% minoxidil, but it actually got me a really bad headache since the moment i use it.. so bad.. i am a guy 26 year old, not bald but really thin hair, i will try the regular minoxidil without that many stuff , will c how it works... but i dont recoment this product...</li>
    <li> Much easier to apply than the liquid. I see some hair growth in sparse areas. Hairline has filled in as well.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out like Rogaine.</li>
    <li> It works but give it take sometime</li>
    <li> Use it as twice a day and new hair will start coming in! It has with me.</li>
    <li> The product is working for me...I start seeing a difference in three weeks. One in-accuracy...it is not a two month supply. I followed instructions on dispensing the product and it only last for a little over three weeks...had to order more!</li>
    <li> it works and cheeper than rogan . and easer to find . my hair is gowing . great stuff will buy again</li>
    <li> It worked alittle I did see growth but it runny...I had headache after using this product .so I probably wont use this product again</li>
    <li> Disappointed that the product shows that it may be toxic to cats!! Beware!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll see, product bottle says can take up to 4 months to see results.</li>
    <li> My husband didn&#x27;t really see any results. It seems like he didn&#x27;t lose any more hair while using it (thus the three stars) but we&#x27;re not entirely sure as he&#x27;s losing hair very slowly.  We&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> Its too early to give concrete conmment on the same. But the product is definitely good one.&lt;br /&gt;Will have to wait and watch the results for more time. Overall, Hair fall has been arrested, that&#x27;s a good sign I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely, worth trying one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with a saw palmetto supplement for a little over a month now. I am 24 and my hairline has started to rapidly recede over the past year, I was worried because many forums said that this hair would never regrow or would only grow fine hairs. Since I started this have already had some actual hair growth along the sides receding the furthest back. My bangs are still thinning, but the hairs do seem to be a bit thicker and I don&#x27;t see my whole scalp when I style my hair up now.</li>
    <li> i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
    <li> My hubby loves it.. uses it all the time</li>
    <li> This product was a TOTAL waste of money - it did nothing to re-grow ANY hair - hair loss is worse if anything!  I have used it for several months and NOTHING!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should check out these products before they put this garbage on their website.  I no doubt will not use AMAZON again!  And you never get your money back from any of these kind of products!</li>
    <li> I like this because it comes out as a foam.  I can then apply it to my scalp and it wont drip from my scalp.  I seem to be getting good results in the 1 month I&#x27;ve been using it so far.  I actually apply this about 3 times a day. I am also taking Propecia.  Since using this product I think I am seeing better results.</li>
    <li> Just an FYI folks, dont worry about any head aches.  I&#x27;ve had no headaches or side effects what so ever.  I have had good results so far with the Hairomega oral suppliments, so when they came out with a topical serum I jumped at the opportunity.  Its to soon to comment on if it works yet.  But I&#x27;ll let ya know.</li>
    <li> This product worked as well as the liquid form, but the smell was very strong. I don&#x27;t recommend using it before bed or the smell could keep you awake.</li>
    <li> Took a while to start showing results (3-4 months), but with consistent use, the hair loss has almost completely stopped.  I take the supplements as well. This is a great value!  Not crazy about the dispenser, so I use another one.</li>
    <li> Just started using this says it may take up to 4 months to see any affects.  Have been taking the Hairomega 3-in-1 pills for over a year.  Maybe the combination will give me the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hairomega serum for a prolonged period of time and have noticed a slowdown in hair thinning.  The product is easy to apply and there is no problem with burning and scarring of my scalp which I have experienced with Minoxidil in the past.  I like the fact that this product deals with DHT(the culprit) as well as hair regrowth.</li>
    <li> I have been having terrible problems with hair loss due to autoimmune problems.  I have been using this product, along with Nizoral shampoo, for a little over almost two months and am very happy with the results so far.  The fall has slowed down noticeably and I see some regrowth coming in along the hairline.  It also adds fullness to my existing hair.  I&#x27;m only taking off a star because it is quite expensive for the amount of product and I am on disability and so my income is extremely limited.  It does work, though, and with absolutely no side effects (I am sensitive to everything but have no problems with Hairomega).</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is foam as it&#x27;s easier to use.  I don&#x27;t see hair growth but...l find less hair in the sink and on my hair brush. That alone is important to me.  Just have to be patient to see further results.</li>
    <li> I have never wrote a review in my life. This one is worth writing about. I had hair receding where most men do when they hit 30. it was driving me crazy. Started using this product. got small results in 3 months. took around 6 months to get good results. around 8 months for full results. It brought back all the small hairs that where not noticeable. only problem is ill be using this product for the rest of my life because im scared not do and see all my hair fall out. I would use twice a day only on the troubled arias.</li>
    <li> I actually see some growth around the hairline!  The back is still sparce, but that&#x27;ll need time.  I am also using a shampoo and conditioner that I believe is contributing to the positive results!</li>
    <li> This product would not foam and it was imposible to use in the liquid form I did not like it</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 months. It works. My hair now is better than before.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 months .  I have very fine thin hair and this seems to be working.  I also use many other volumizing products and hair , skin and nail vitamins.  But I have reordered the product and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> i started seeing results after 2 months. It really works, it just takes time.</li>
    <li> After 6 months of use I can now see moderate growth. It workS well and I like it better than the drops because it&#x27;s less messy.</li>
    <li> The reason I gave this product a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; rating is that I&#x27;ve just started using it and suspect that I will need at least 3 months of use before I can objectively state my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since Dec. 5, 2012, I bought 2 bottles so far.... as of today, 3/26/13, there are no improvement on the top of my head...where I lost hairs... ..</li>
