<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have suffered from KP almost my entire life.  This is one of the first products that has ever worked!  After only one week, my skins has shown significant improvement in appearance but more important is how soft if feels.  AND, it feels good against my clothes,  not irritated.  I use it after showering in the morning and then right before bed.  I also don&#x27;t use a lot ... just enough to coat my skin and have to rub in a little.  Excellent.  If I could give it 10 stars I would.  But this is way overpriced here .... your local Target, Walmart or a drug store is much less expensive.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness.....something that actually works on KP!  Highly recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> helps if you have bumpy skin</li>
    <li> Excellent!!!  Leaves body smooth.</li>
    <li> Has helped reduce the redness and bumpy chicken skin on 12 year old daughter, she now feels confident enough to wear short sleeves again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and I still have bumpy skin. It feels better but I am going to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from red bumps on my upper arms for many years. I tried acid peel body washes and tons of other products but never had impressive results. This product is what I&#x27;ve been waiting for. Bumps are gone in a week. Skin feels amazing!!!</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING!  I&#x27;m a male and I have a problem with Keratosis pilaris, especially on my arms and legs.  I was embarrassed if anyone put their hand on my arms.    I used to try to exfoliate it in various ways.  They really never went away, and sometimes it even seemed to be worse.  When I heard about, \\&quot;Gold Bond Ultimate - Rough &amp; Bumpy Skin\\&quot;, I was eager to try it.  Within 24 hours of the first use, I was actually able to notice some difference!  The KP was certainly not gone, but I was able to notice a difference.  I don&#x27;t know if everyone would notice anything that quickly, but I did.  So, I continued to use the product.  This is the ONLY treatment that I have used that actually produced results!  Now, my arms and legs are GREATLY improved and MUCH smoother!  I am no longer embarrassed for someone to put their hand on my arm.    As for smell; It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell at all. Not enough that people right next to you would even notice.    It is not a complete cure, but the improvement is so significant that I can be comfortable and confident!  I no longer pull away in embarrassment when someone reaches out to touch me!    This is truly a great product and a must-have tool for someone with Keratosis pilaris.  If anyone suffers from Keratosis pilaris, for goodness sakes, shell out a couple of bucks and at least TRY this!  I&#x27;m VERY GLAD that I did!</li>
    <li> Unbelievably Fabulous Cream. I have had bumpy, rough skin for years. Nothing worked. I have tried a ton of lotions and potions that were useless. This cream worked almost immediately. Love it!</li>
    <li> Organic Coconut oil worked better for me than this did, It was worth a try!</li>
    <li> New to me and I have 3 diff kinds of keratosis of the skin so I am a mess....dry, cracked, bumpy spots...the whole gambit so I am trying something new....will be back on a later date after I see what continued use of this does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product a little over a week and I already see a drastic difference. I&#x27;ve unfortunately got KP in all of my more intimate areas- my inner thighs, sides of my breasts and my butt, as well as my upper arms and a little circular patch just under my arm-pit...basically, I&#x27;m eat up with it!! Womp womp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing several dermatologists and spending tons on prescription creams, and trying every home remedy I could find, I was happy to give this a go. (I got it at Walgreens for 11.99, all 3 Targets in my town were sold out, and it was worth the $3 to not have to go in Walmart, haha!) But, my KP is almost completely gone from my breasts now! I am stunned and so thankful for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not completely gone, but just to feel the skin, it feels smooth, and thats not something I&#x27;ve ever been able to say in my adult life. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my other areas, but I&#x27;m honestly not as worried about them, either. The smell of this stuff is pretty awful, but it does fade as the product sinks in, please don&#x27;t alter the formula in favor of smell!! I am so excited to see what my skin looks like after the first month!! I will gladly repurchase this monthly, and use it daily to keep up these results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have said, I use this after my shower, and I lightly exfoliate the areas I&#x27;m going to apply it.</li>
    <li> 1st I have to ask: What smell are several people complaining about?  I almost didn&#x27;t order this since I am rather sensitive to smells.  I find this to be completely odorless!  I&#x27;ve never smelled a thing.  2nd: It works.  I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks &amp; I notice a difference in my skin.  Shortly after receiving I was rubbing into my arms when I noticed it was exfoliating my skin.  And I mean a lot!!!!  Since that one time this has not happened again but I took this to be a good thing.  Anyway, bottom line it seems to be improving the texture of my skin and it doesn&#x27;t smell.  I would highly recommend.,</li>
    <li> Not sure why my skin turned so rough... too much Arizona sun?... After about two weeks of daily use I have felt a great difference, even some of the bumps have gone.  Large enough container that this stuff will last for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> My son has severe eczema, to the point the Dr has given at least 3 prescriptions and nothing worked.  I was at my wits end and saw an advertisement for this on TV.  I am SO glad I did.  I applied it in the morning and about 3-4 hours later I noticed a HUGE difference.  3 days later, my sons eczema is cleared up and his skin is so soft!  I even use it for myself!</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this lotion but it&#x27;s been a month now and I really haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference. When I apply it, my arms look even more red and bumpy than usual, but I figure thats just the exfoliator in the product. I put it on daily after i shower so I&#x27;m not sure why I haven&#x27;t seen a difference... I may call it quits since the cream leaves my arms sticky all day. This stuff doesn&#x27;t soak in or come off all day until you wash it off! Oh well worth a shot.</li>
    <li> It leaves a residue on my skin and felt almost sticky.  I could actually brush my skin with my fingers and debris came off from the dried lotion..it was embarrassing.</li>
    <li> Ok ok so I&#x27;m wayyyy too lazy and too productive to actually do  product reviews!!! But once I got my hands on this Gold Bond Rough &amp; Bumpy skin I knew my day has came to do a product review!! ok so one day I had hash-tagged KP and I seen a lot of raves for this new product! So I had a gift card from Wal-Mart  for 10 bucks and I believe this product was 8.99 or 9.99 so basically I got mine for free, you get what I&#x27;m saying.. I tried it out for like 2 days and I was ready to trash it like the Amlactin I got from  Wal-Mart as well.. but I didnt give up so soon this time! And by golly im glad I didnt! This stuff is AAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMAAAAZZING I woke up this morning to get something and then I happened to feel my arms where I have KP bad and I was like hooolllllly craaaap my arms feel awesome! When I tell you guys I suffer from KP extremely bad its extremely bad and it feels gross and disgusting but my arms feel loved now haha!! my legs and my arms are filled with embarrassing bumps but I feel like this and perhaps a future diet change and these bad boys are heading to the grave! The smoothness is real!! It took me two days to notice a change!! I first exfoliate my skin with a sugar scrub and a lil scrubby thingy you can get from Walmart the sugar scrub is like 4.99 and you roughen up the bumps and exfoliate and then you put the cream on after the shower.. thats all I did and two days later my arms feel smooth... I will say this if you suffer from it like I suffer from it you may get a sticky feel to your skin and see residue but trust me give it a few days and your skin will thank you!!! do yourself a favor and buy this stuff for 9 bucks you cant beat that for the shame and embarrassment we suffer from!!</li>
    <li> My 2 year old has KP and this actually has made a noticeable difference for his skin. I was skeptical but after about a month of use I&#x27;m a believer. Having said that, it&#x27;s expensive and since the KP doesn&#x27;t bother him at all I might not be purchasing the cream again for a while but I do think it really helped.</li>
    <li> It works on my six year old!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to buy this since I saw the commercial. And I am so glad I did! This has really helped with my upper arms. The bumps are almost gone, and I have never had a product do that. Not only did it do that but it also made my skin so soft, even my constantly dry elbows. I apply it every morning right out of the shower and then also at night before bed. My only issue (hence the four stars) is that the redness is still a big issue. Other reviews I read said their redness was reduced, but I have not experienced that at all. I just wish there was something to handled it all: bumpy skin, red blotchy skin, and dry skins!</li>
    <li> Been using for quite a few weeks and the bumps on my arms are pretty much non-existant.  I&#x27;ve since started using on my upper thigh and expect the same results there.  For anyone on the fence, it does the job.  I use it every morning after dried from the shower.  I may start using every other day on my arms, now that they are bump free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for four days now, so far I&#x27;ve noticed that the bumps have reduced in size a little bit, my skin does feel softer and more hydrated than before. I&#x27;ve had KP my whole life and this is helping so far but it&#x27;s too early to tell completely. The smell really isn&#x27;t as bad as everyone is saying, it does have a plastic like smell to it but it&#x27;s not that bad, no one would notice the smell in public. As for the feeling of it on your skin, it does feel a little sticky but to be honest I&#x27;ve always hated how any lotion feels on my skin since I was a little kid but this lotion doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. A lot of people are saying that it leaves the redness in your skin, if you go outside a lot or get a tan it will hide the redness. I&#x27;ll update this review in a couple weeks when I fully see what it does for my skin</li>
    <li> This works better than I expected! I&#x27;m in my 40s and I&#x27;ve had the &amp;#34;rough and bumpys&amp;#34; on my arms for my entire life. I trust Gold Bond so I decided I had to try this product. When I first received it I was a little surprised to see a typo on the label. It actually made me worry that I might have gotten a fake product. I guess it was crazy of me, but I shrugged it off and tried it anyway. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the real deal because it is the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that does work!&lt;br /&gt;It does leave my skin feeling a little odd. It feels smooth and the bumps are gone, but it isn&#x27;t really a soft feeling. Because of this I alternate between using this and my own homemade body butter - and it works out as a great combination for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t great but that doesn&#x27;t bother me, I use it at night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> The cream has worked better than they had described it would.  I am Diabetic and was having problems with dry itchy lumpy skin on my forearms.  The cream has all but elimatred the dry ichness and the skin has go color and softness.  Fantastc product thank you so much for offering such a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Great body cream.  Saw immediate results.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical whether this would help, since even prescription strength creams seemed to do next to nothing, but just a week into using this, my skin has made a remarkable change. I&#x27;d say the bumps/roughness is diminished by maybe 80% over a fairly large area. I&#x27;ve noticed it does leave the skin feeling a little tacky, but it&#x27;s well worth it to have smooth skin again.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s exactly for what&#x27;s intended. Highly recommend it for it. Would give it 5 stars if it had a lighter texture/film after application.</li>
    <li> It is kind of shocking how well and how quickly this works. Within 2 weeks my husband had smooth arms, after trying tons of other creams for many years. Get this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Got rid of bumps on my wife&#x27;s arm in a week.</li>
    <li> I cannot begin to tell you, how much I love this product! Due to the fact that I have tried so many products that claim to do what this product does. Thank You Gold Bond! Now I do not have to look any further, I have found the one, Gold Bond Ultimate Rough &amp; Bumpy Skin Daily... Thanks Gold Bond!</li>
    <li> This stuff worked wonders for me. I have had stubborn bumps on the backs of my legs for years. After just a week of using this 2-3 times a day, the bumps are 95% gone. So, so pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I have used Gold Bond products in the past.  They are good products but I haven&#x27;t found any that were unscented.  So I never bought more.  I took a chance buying this huge tub of lotion. And it is big.  I ordered anyway.  I am amazed at the cream. It is more like a lotion when you apply it.  Thin when it&#x27;s applied, which I like.  Not like working paste into your skin.  I bought it for a problem area on my elbow and arm.  Before long I was putting it on my feet, the next day on my hands, and then last evening on my face.  What a wonderful cream.  Usually when I use a lotion or cream I have to go wash my hands and face as I can &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it and find it annoying.  Not this product, it actually felt good.  It soothed my burning hands, calmed the patch on my arm and elbow and my face feels like silk the day after the nighttime use.  Now this is a new product to me, so I will attempt to give you an update in about a month.  My husband has very dry feet, so I told him he should give it a try, as a very high end product I bought for him feels good, but isn&#x27;t doing anything to improve his situation.  You should at least give it a try if you are looking for an all around good lotion or cream.  I buy a high end cream at the beauty counter at a high end department store (or can be found a major beauty stores). I love it but find it costly, this tub of cream worked just like that and felt just as good.  I was near the point of reordering but think I will continue the use of Gold Bond Ultimate Rough and Bumpy Skin Daily Therapy Skin Cream and see what happens.  It would cost me thousands of dollars to fill this 8 oz. tub with the product I was using on my face.  So far so good and am surprised at my reaction to this product.  I did know Chattem, Inc. was a very old company and thought this might really be a good product, but took a chance when I bought it.  From my short term experience, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this product.  It does have a slight smell, which Ican&#x27;t smell, but my husband says it is very mild and non offensive. I usually use unscented products due to chemical sensitivity problems.  I am able to use this without it making me ill or just finding the smell offensive.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she is very pleased with the results. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This really works.  I have bumpy skin on the back of my upper arms.  This cream makes my skin feel smoother.</li>
    <li> Does what it says to improve dry skin if used as directed. My skin has a glowing sheen too. I love it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Great customer services!!</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;m actually the wife posting as I&#x27;m the one who uses the product.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has worked wonders! I bought this on a whim at Target one day after a doctors appointment. I had asked my doctor about the KP on my legs, and she wanted to prescribe me a steroid cream. I&#x27;m already on more meds than I want to be so I didn&#x27;t want to expose my body to yet another steroid. Therefore, I ended up at Target and purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical but figured it was worth a shot. I bought this the end of January and at first I used it everyday. After about two weeks I wasn&#x27;t noticing any improvement so I came on Amazon and started reading reviews to see if anyone had any tips. I found one that suggested only applying it after showering and after exfoliating your skin. So, I started trying that. Since I wasn&#x27;t applying it everyday, only when I showered, then I stopped paying attention. It was about the beginning of March that I actually looked at my legs as I applied the cream and noticed that my one leg was almost clear! My left leg had it much worse then my right leg, and my right leg was the one that was almost clear. It is now the end of March, and my right leg is fully clear, and my left leg is almost clear. I still apply the cream to both legs and have used about 3/4 of the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it have a smell to it? Yes, but it&#x27;s not that bad. After about 10 minutes I no longer notice the smell. I&#x27;ve smelt much, much worse in life. It&#x27;s very tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it greasy? A little, but after about 10 minutes you no longer notice it. By then your skin has absorbed the cream and your skin feels smooth. Don&#x27;t over apply the cream, just apply enough to cover what you&#x27;re applying it to. More isn&#x27;t necessarily better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are patient, and apply the cream after showing, I&#x27;m betting that you&#x27;ll see results. It took my legs just over a month to really notice a difference. But, it&#x27;s truly worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used this product long enough to find out how well it works but it is very sticky &amp; tacky.  I don&#x27;t feel I can wear clothing over an application of this product, HOWEVER, if it works I will be pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in a drug store for about $5 cheaper.  If you can&#x27;t find it where you live, I highly recommend buying from amazon.  This is one of the best beauty products I have ever purchased.  It claims to take up to 4 weeks to see results, but I felt them immediately! My skin had never been so silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Have tried many products over the years, I noticed from the first application that this product absorbed immediately. As stated, I noticed the difference in my arms within 24 hours. After a week, they keep improving. It may not work for others or for all skin issues, however, I will continue to use it from now on.</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with KP my entire life and have not been able to find anything that works. THIS WORKS. if you have tried everything with no luck and have not tried this yet-take my word for it. It is nothing compared to most treatment costs and its at your local convenient store or a click away on Amazon. Do yourself a favor and buy this stuff.</li>
    <li> I am about halfway through the jar &amp; I definitely notice a difference. I have KP REALLY bad! I will review again after I complete the jar.</li>
    <li> Caused my skin to have a strange film on it as well as made my KP worse. Maybe I had a bad reaction!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had rough skin on the back of my arms due to KP for many years. After several weeks of daily use, my skin is noticibly smoother with less red bumps. Seems to work so far!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from KP for 15 years. I sort of just thought I had to live with it. I have used one entire jar for the last couple of months now on my thighs and upper arms where the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; is worst and my skin now, has never been so soft and clear. This has changed everything. I&#x27;d say the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the strange maple syrup smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a couple tubs with no improvement to skin bumps. It makes me feel sticky all day too.  I do like putting it on my feet and sleeping with socks on.  Makes my feet stay really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For KP and related red marks I have had great success with Swiss medical whitening mask.  It&#x27;s more expensive but I&#x27;ve had major improvements in just one tub. I put a thin layer on my arms and leave it on overnight.</li>
    <li> This cream works some. It did not do any miracles for me, but it definitely improved the aspect and feel of my skin.</li>
    <li> I went to the dermatologist to get rid of two lumps on my chin.  She didn&#x27;t know what they are and did not know what to do about them.  I am using Gold Bond Rough &amp; Bumpy Skin on them, and they are getting smaller.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my upper arms which have always been riddled with little red bumps. Smells terrible but I want to trust that it&#x27;s a worthwhile lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Using too much of it at once left my arms feeling sticky with some weird residue, so use sparingly. Been using it for a few months and I see a small difference but nothing dramatic.</li>
    <li> The product works very well, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week straight and much to my surprise it seems to be working. I have areas of very clear, smooth skin appear on my arms where the Pilaris keratosis is present.</li>
    <li> Ok, this stuff actually works.  It works wonders on that bumpy skin on the back of your arms.  Apply it on in a really thin coat, otherwise it will be flaking and rubbing off.  Great product, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had KP on my arms and jaw line for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve tried everything throughout the years. I was hoping this would finally be the answer. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t one of the lucky ones. I tried this lotion on 3 separate occasions. Every single one of which I broke out in hives. My advice, if you already have sensitive skin this will probably be too harsh for you.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!!!!!!!  This stuff is  amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works wonders with daily use.</li>
    <li> This product had zero effect on my skin.  It&#x27;s greasy and smells like urine.</li>
    <li> Softens skin very well, and very quickly</li>
    <li> After many many years of bumpy arms I finally found out that there is a name for this condition!  Keratosis Pilarsis.  I have found that most products do not deliver as promised and was leery to purchase a jar but decided to give it a try anyway.  I think the only time in my life that I did not have bumpy arms was when I was 13/14 and sat out all afternoon at a track meet in a sleeveless dress and burned oh so badly.  But my arms, although quite painful, were baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night I applied too much of the cream and it did roll up and flake off.  My next application was just a thin thin coating to my arms and scrubbing it and the dead skin off when I shower.  For the first week I applied this twice a day but thereafter only use it once a day after showering.  Such a difference in the bumps.  They are no longer visible and my arms are nice and smooth to the touch.  I feel like it&#x27;s a miracle creme.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll have to use it every day forever but I really don&#x27;t mind if my arms will stay smooth.  The smell isn&#x27;t great and the creme doesn&#x27;t feel especially silky as a body lotion makes my skin feel but this is little enough to put up with to have the joy of smooth arms.  At the rate I&#x27;m using the jar, I believe it will last at least three months.  I only wish I had had this creme when I had young shapely arms and wanted to wear sleeveless clothing!</li>
    <li> This does make my skin feel softer and smoother, but it doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the bumps on my arms. While it smells okay in the jar, after putting it on my skin it did have a scent but it dissipates after the cream completely dries.</li>
    <li> This is really overpriced. I bought this at Target for $7.99...the same size jar. I find it sticky and kind of crumbly feeling on my skin. I can&#x27;t really get past those issues to even see if my skin is less bumpy.</li>
    <li> Has lessened the bumps on back of my arms and legs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son who has KP, with hopes that it might work for him. And it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He only has KP on his arms and I wouldn&#x27;t call it mild or severe and has very little on his cheeks. After two days of using it on him, I saw a difference. After a month, it amazes me how you can barely see it and how smooth his arms feel. It&#x27;s not completely gone and it probably won&#x27;t go completely away but it has changed his skin tremendously!</li>
    <li> It arrived  quickly and on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried SO many products for my skin and nothing ever seemed to give results.  So far, I  am incredibly  happy with this product.  I have only been using it for about 4 days now, once in the morning and once at night, and i already see amazing improvements!  My skin is actually  soft and smooth.  i can&#x27;t  wait to see what its like weeks or even months after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend  this product to anyone who has bumpy skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works. I haave had bumps on my upper arms, thighs and sides of my belly for a while now. Ive tried other lotions, soaps, and even acne medicine. But this stuff nearly cleared all of that in just a few weeks. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> really like how it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Amlactin and another lotion specifically for KP on the back of my arms, behind, and thighs...nothing.  It always felt tacky or greasy (or both) and of course they smell kinda icky (but I was willing to pay the price).  I gave each lotion a month to make ANY difference and while I did get some healing (10%), nothing dramatic for two to three times the cost of Gold Bond...plus like I said they felt nasty on the skin.  My husband suggested I try this ($10-12 at most brick and mortar stores) and first I loved that you used a tiny amount.  Secondly, it goes on and ABSORBS without any offending odor or feelings of greasy or tackiness.  HOWEVER, if you use too much it will ball up (but heck you don&#x27;t need that much so it&#x27;s a win-win).  I started this in November 2014 and by the end of December ALL my skin that I use this on (truck and extremities) is SMOOTH AS A BABY.  I&#x27;m in my mid 40s, I don&#x27;t have overtly dry skin, but had huge KP bumps and I&#x27;d pick at them, which of course made them scar and worse.  Most of my scars are gone (I have two left).  I say try this for KP.  Give it 2 months and see what it can do for you!!</li>
    <li> You know, I saw this stuff and thought, &amp;#34;ugh, another lotion that&#x27;s overpriced claiming to do stuff that all the others have in the past&amp;#34; But this stuff ACTUALLY works!! I have KP. Have had it forever. I&#x27;ve tried alot of different stuff to get rid of it, nothing ever does. I wanted to try this, but I wasn&#x27;t paying 12 dollars for it. 3 weeks ago I got a tattoo, and went to the store to look for a lotion for that, and while I was in the isle I saw someone had left a coupon for the rough and bumpy skin and figured I&#x27;d try it. I started putting it on the areas affected everyday, and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks and the bumps are almost all gone! my arms look great! I&#x27;m shocked and amazed by this product, I hope they don&#x27;t ever quit making it because I will continue to buy it. Thanks Gold bond! If there&#x27;s any cons, it&#x27;s the smell. They could change that. It&#x27;s got a really funky smell about it, it&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s not like most lotion smells either. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it now.</li>
    <li> it works!! takes time but works :)</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  My son is 8 and has always had very bumpy and rough skin on his arms.  I&#x27;ve bought all sorts of lotions to try and none of them worked very well.  Aveena was the closest but still didn&#x27;t fix the problem.  I saw a commercial for this stuff and decided to take a chance and try it.  It has drastically reduced the bumpiness of his arms!  It hasn&#x27;t made it go away but that might be because of me.  I remember &#x27;most&#x27; nights to put it on his arms but I do forget sometimes.  Once I let about a week go by before I put any on and his bumpiness started coming back.  I&#x27;ll keep using this stuff!  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that actually does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> This lotion did not do much for my KP, it&#x27;s an OK moisturizer in itself, but did not cure my KP.  Since I know that KP is very frustrating for most people I will say that when I cut wheat and dairy out of my diet I started to notice a HUGE improvement on the back of my arms.  If nothing has worked for you so far I recommend you try an Alkaline Diet.  Stay the course for 3-weeks and I think there&#x27;s a great chance you&#x27;ll see a big improvement like I did.</li>
    <li> I used the entire jar and couldn&#x27;t tell much difference in my rough and bumpy skin on my arms and thighs.</li>
    <li> I just got this cream last week so I have yet to know if it works BUT the smell is a big turn off. It definitely is not scentless. The smell it not pleasant and almost makes me not want to use it. Also it leaves a film on your skin that almost has a rough feeling when you rub your hand over it. Not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to use it long enough to know if it works which is disapponting cause I had high hopes for it.</li>
    <li> No better than many other products</li>
    <li> Within 4 days of using this Gold Bond cream I was noticing great results. The bumps on the back of my arms were noticeably smoother and less visible. I was very excited because other products I have tried didn&#x27;t work. Unfortunately for me, after the 4th day I developed a rash on my arms. I assume it must have been an allergic reaction to the cream because my arms turned red and itched where I was using the cream. The rash lasted about a week and was extremely itch and miserable. I had to return the cream, which is a shame, because it was working great until I got the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5 stars because of how fast and how well it worked. I didn&#x27;t see any other reviews about issues with allergies or rashes so it must have been something unique to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from Keratosis pilaris (KP). I recommend using a very small amount because it leaves the skin with a sticky feeling and has an unpleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works! I&#x27;m as shocked as anyone, but it took care of the weird bumpy skin on my arms and I didn&#x27;t have a reaction to it (I have really sensitive skin).</li>
    <li> Thanks to this cream. I started to see smoother skin within a week. The bumps on the back of my hand and inner knee area definitely reduced. I will continue to use twice daily.</li>
    <li> Helps reduce rough and bumpy skin,</li>
    <li> With so many creams making SO many promises; I decided to put this one through &amp;#34;the test.&amp;#34; I used it only on my left elbow area to see if there was a noticeable difference. After the first application the difference was very noticeable. After 3 days of using it, the difference was amazing!! This really does soften the rough areas of your skin quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product. I&#x27;ve used it every day after I shower to the backs of my arms- little to no improvement of the bumps whatsoever. I won&#x27;t be recommending this to any of my patients that may complain of keratosis. It&#x27;s a fine regular lotion- good smell skin feels moistened but the bumps are still there. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> works well if you use it daily</li>
    <li> Why wasn&#x27;t it sealed? In my experience lotions come sealed under the lid. This however was not.</li>
    <li> Product works very well on dry bumpy skin. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Yes, it works but yo need to apply everyday!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Go to bed bumpy and wake up smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> It works like it claim it does.😀</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bumpy skin since I was little, so bad that it would crack and my mom had to put lotion on me and wrap me up while I cried. For years I have never found anything that ever worked. I&#x27;ve even tried perscription lotions that were expensive and nothing worked! I saw this on a comercial and I thought why not try it since I&#x27;ve tried everything else. It has worked amazing! My skin is horrible in the winter where I can&#x27;t even shave my legs because I would scratch them up so bad from all of the bumps. They would be physically painful. This lotion has made this winter so easy, my skin is nicer than it has ever been and I&#x27;m going to continue to use this forever and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> My wife has seen a change in her skin.</li>
    <li> Actually helps a lot. Not a miracle cure but any improvement is a thrill to see. Smoothes and softens the skin. Less bumps just 2 weeks later. Worth the $20 I paid but found out you can pick this up at Target for under $10.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has KP and it is almost gone after just a week of use!  Will definitely continue to use!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe it, it actually works. I&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my thighs for as long as I can remember. I tried Amlactin with zero results. I&#x27;ve only been using the gold bond a couple of weeks and have already noticed a reduction in bumps. Both lotions are expensive but at least this one works for me. It has zero smell. I use a loofah to exfoliate in the shower for better absorption. I also added a tea tree oil along with it which is also great for keratosis pilaris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to everyone about the price. I&#x27;ll be checking my local drugstore instead.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately,  the product leaked out of the container and was a mess upon receipt.  We never got to actually try the product.</li>
    <li> Really helps!  Will buy again for sure!</li>
    <li> If I could give this product zero stars I would. This cream is advertised to clear up rough &amp; bumpy skin due to Keratosis Pilaris. It goes way beyond that. It dissolves skin. Yep, dissolves, as in, leaves craters and pits in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Look it up: potassium hydroxide. It is a chemical formula that dissolves skin.&lt;br /&gt;My teenager used it for the bumps on forearms and thighs, ending up with almost dime-sized blister looking sores, that became craters, that are now scars. The dermatologist had to treat my child for a staph infection caused by the open sores.&lt;br /&gt;It will take a very long time for my teenager&#x27;s skin to recover. I&#x27;m sure the scarring will never fully go away.&lt;br /&gt;I trusted this company to actually help an embarrassing skin condition. This product made the condition a thousand times worse.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a good product.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Really works!  Fast</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target for 9.99.  I really liked it.  Then I bought the amlac stuff--and I will be honest this is just not as good as the amlac.  But it is still a good product and I could easily see it as a replacement if you travel and don&#x27;t want to lug the giant amlac bottle around.  I use it primarily on my neck and the amlac on the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> After a month of using this product, my skin was no smoother than before.  It does not live up to it&#x27;s sales pitch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days but I can feel a difference on the tiny bumps I have on my shoulders and upper arms.  A little goes a long way so it&#x27;ll last a long time.  I use it a few times a day and have started using it on my face as well with no problems.  It is medicated and does not have a great smell so I put my favorite body butter on top of it when I&#x27;m going out.  So far it does what it says and I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Works well but must be faithful to see results.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! It smooths stubborn, bumpy skin in a few days, and it lasts!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but the results after only one week were amazing.  It really works.</li>
    <li> Fantastic working cream... I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent result. Did its job very well. Like it very much.</li>
    <li> I have a multitude of skin issues and after diligently using this (after bathing when my skin is still slightly damp) for the last month or so, I can say that it has not affected the color of my skin (still quite pink!) but my skin is very, very smooth. I use this everywhere, not just on my trouble areas, because after decades of oatmeal baths and countless lotions and oils, this is the best quality moisturizer I have ever used. I think the only thing that would make this better is if it came in a pump, but I think it&#x27;s too thick for that.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. I see no change in my arms. Disappointed</li>
    <li> Absolutely non-greasy, soaks in quickly, moisturizes well and my dermatologist was thrilled with the results on my rough and bumpy KP skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! Combined it with the use of a the generic Aveno moisturizing body wash. It took using the product twice a day for 5 weeks, but it was well worth it. The bumps are gone for the first time in 50 years!!! I stopped using the cream about a month ago, but continued to wash the area with the moisturizing body wash. The bumps have not come back. My only problem with the product is that it does not seem to absorb well into the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually lucky enough to experience great results from using any product. But the Rough &amp; Bumpy lotion made my skin more smooth and soft within just days. It is tacky feeling after application, but the next morning it&#x27;s so soft. The KP bumps aren&#x27;t gone, but overall softer skin makes them less noticeable upon touch. It&#x27;s $9.99 for 8 oz  at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of body creams and lotions and this one does the job.  I like that there is no scent to this cream and it goes on well without leaving me feeling greasy.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks and it&#x27;s sticky.  It may work at decreasing bumps but I honestly don&#x27;t know show would be willing to reapply it often enough to find out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Walmart since it was cheaper than Amazon ($9.97 vs. $12.58) which is shocking since 99% of the time Amazon has the best price for whatever I need. Anyway, I haven&#x27;t used this lotion long enough to see long term results, but it makes my skin and somewhat rough knees and elbows extremely soft! I have very, very subtle KP in random spots on my body (inner side of my knees, back of uppers calves and the bottom of my butt cheeks where they merge with my thighs). I wouldn&#x27;t even say I have KP because the bumps are sparse and those with full blown KP would probably punch me in the face for even complaining, but it annoys me nonetheless.The bumps have been there for as long as I can remember, but I never knew what the heck they were and just accepted their presence. I do notice that they become more visible if I become lazy with applying moisturizer. I&#x27;m going to pay close attention to these little guys over the next few weeks and report my results. Oh, and the smell reminds me Duncan Hines buttercream frosting. Not bad or overwhelming, just a little strange. I keep thinking there&#x27;s cupcakes nearby.</li>
    <li> Has helped by dry Winter skin...even put it on my face and it has gotten rid of all of the dry flakey skin.</li>
    <li> The product is very good but be aware you can buy the same thing at Wal-Mart for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> This has certainly made a noticeable difference in the appearance of KP on my upper arms. Just FYI, a few years ago I started an Atkins-type/low carb diet and my KP almost disappeared within a month (along with 28 pounds!) I had made no other changes. I fell off the low carb wagon in September 2014 and the KP is back. I am using this cream AND trying to go back to the low carb lifestyle.</li>
    <li> better than any I have tried</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Product as stated.  No issues!!</li>
    <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that #1 worked #2 worked in the amount of time advertised! Ive had KP since high school and the only time it&#x27;s cleared up was the two times ive been pregnant. Otherwise it&#x27;s connnnnstantly there. I tried this cream for 4 days and started noticing a difference on how my skin felt. The bumps were still visible but didn&#x27;t feel as rough. After a little over a week, the bumps are almost completely gone!! Yes it does leave a thin film on my skin but I&#x27;ve been putting it on at night before bed, rubbin in well, and then I shower in the morning.I&#x27;ll gladly trade that for getting rid of the ugly bumps. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this!</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best lotion on the market! I have been fighting extremely dry skin for 55 years &amp; nothing, including some prescription medication, has worked as well. I have only been using this lotion for a month, but it has already cleared up my skin &amp; other sun damage I had. THANK YOU, again &amp; again.</li>
    <li> This product is very good at exfoliating skin as promised .  It did not help my dry skin as much as i would have liked.  This product arrived in safe shipping materials and came to me quickly.  I would recommend the company to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband has struggled with KP (Keratosis Pilaris) for years and nothing seemed to work when applied to the skin. I was really skeptical when I heard Gold Bond came out with a product that \\&quot;guaranteed\\&quot; results. I searched around a bit to purchase it, and boy is it difficult to find. I eventually found it on drugstore.com but they quickly sold out. A few more days of hunting and Target had it, on sale ($9) too!    The texture of the product is wonderful, thick and creamy. The smell, ehh slightly less wonderful. If you are a user of AmLactin you are well aware these types of products are not known for the amazing fragrance. After using this product daily, it has helped reduce both the look and texture of KP. It is not completely gone, and I did not expect it to completely vanish. The bumps are now a faint pink color, and are smooth. I&#x27;ve found this product is best used after exfoliating in the shower with a loofah or sponge, applied very thinly afterwards. When we first got the product I would apply it heavily, and it would slough off a few hours later. When used after a shower in place of a lotion, the product seems to work million times better.    I personally do not struggle with KP, but I have some of the roughest elbows around, I started applying this on them directly in lieu of lotion, and it has dramatically reduced the roughness. I too am sold!    Now for why I knocked a star off; the pricing discrepancies of this product is absolutely absurd. It ranges from $9 up to $30. I shopped around quite a bit to find it for cheap, and unfortunately that was not on Amazon at all. It is in no way a product that I would pay $30 for, the tub is honestly not very big and I would say it would last you about one month if you are a more advanced struggler of KP (multiple areas of body). Our first tub lasted approx 3 weeks when applying it liberally, I expect this second tub to last about 6 weeks. When applied once daily.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I bought this at WalMart after seeing it advertised on television and I have noticed a huge difference in my skin after one week.  After some of the products that I have used, the smell is not a problem  I also use the Gold Bond foot cream and love it as well.  I told my mother about the foot cream and sent her some.  She now uses it regularly and her feet are in better condition than they have ever been.  I am disappointed to see Amazon&#x27;s price on this cream.  I was going to send some to my mother, but it seems that even with my Amazon Prime, it will be cheaper to buy it at WalMart and send it to her via USPS.  And I just renewed my Prime subscription - at the new, higher price.</li>
    <li> Kind of sticky when applied, and doesn&#x27;t have the best odor. I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in &#x27;bumpy&#x27; appearance of skin, but it does have a somewhat instant smoothing effect. I&#x27;m thinking it might be heavy/uncomfortable in warmer weather.</li>
    <li> its a nice and thick cream but i dont like that it makes me feel sticky. i would like for it to be fast absorbing</li>
    <li> No - I wish I knew how to return it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. It heals and softens dry skin if applied daily.</li>
    <li> Worked well.  Would be better in a pump container rather than having to scoop it out.</li>
    <li> This truly worked for me.</li>
    <li> Fast results.  It works. Saw results withing a week using it only once a day - or less. I&#x27;ve tried many OTC treatments including AVEENO which offers temporary relief but not a cure. I guess its the Amlactin in it that makes it work - they figured out a way to get rid of the odor of Amlactin. The Gold Bond is a light weight cream without color or odor.  What am I treating? Years of having scabby skin on my upper arms and across my shoulders from constant itching. The only other thing that has worked is keeping the site covered with bandaides. I have also decided to change to perfume and dye free detergents.  Found it at BB&amp;B. Good Luck with the product.  UPDATE ON 11-5-2014: After barely 6 weeks of use (once a day) my skin is nearly clear, even on my upper arms. I&#x27;m thinking it will also make an effective and inexpensive face cream. The jar does not mention Amlactin as an ingredient - so I am wondering what it is about it that makes it work so completely - no more scratching! Real relief after years of frustration. Practically a miracle cure. Have I said enough?</li>
    <li> I bought this recently, for my 4 year old daughter, from Wal-mart, which I highly recommend doing. Buy this product and if you can get it at Wal-mart, do so! Wal-mart was only, like, $10.00 compared to on here for an OUTRAGEOUS amount of $30. It&#x27;s only been about a week since we&#x27;ve been using this product, 5 days actually, and we&#x27;ve seen a major improvement in our daughter&#x27;s skin. We use it mostly on her upper arms (for dryness &amp; bumps) and her legs (for dryness). While I was putting it on tonight, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth her skin was feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The product is silky smooth and unscented. (Unscented enough. There&#x27;s still a slight smell but very, very mild, not over powering or displeasing at all).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend! Great product!!</li>
    <li> I am a fair-skinned grammy, with extremely dry, flaky skin. My lower legs and forearms are especially prone to this problem, and I have tried everything out there. I own three other Gold Bond products, which give temporary relief...but they were not doing the job I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Saw this advertised on tv and, once again, it sounded promising. I happened to see it at Walmart and decided to give it a try. Before I left the store, I rubbed a bit on one arm, and noticed an immediate improvement! It absorbed in moments, and stayed silky, soft and moisturized the rest of the day. I used it on my legs and other arm when I got home, and after several days, the difference in the feel of my skin is amazing! I was skeptical because it is such a light cream...not heavy or greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Others have made issue of the cost, but I find that it takes so little of the product to accomplish it&#x27;s purpose that even a bit higher cost would not stop me from buying this. I&#x27;m still using the product that was on the top liner of the jar! Haven&#x27;t needed to &#x27;dip in&#x27; yet!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half and I have already noticed a change in my skin much smoother I&#x27;m prone to break outs on my face and I&#x27;ve yet to see a bump but I also use a light acne wash before I put it on</li>
    <li> Great product! Really does work if you give it a chance and use it EVERYDAY. Almost all cleared up up after 5 weeks. Noticed a difference within 1st week. Way overpriced on amazon. Found it at Walgreens 10.99</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I have always suffered from small little white bumps on my forearms and I would always be so embarrassed when wearing short sleeve, when my husband finally noticed them while holding my arm thats when I knew I needed something. I tried this because I was desperate and after the first week I noticed a change right away! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I wrote a review earlier proclaiming i didnt really think the product did anything... now after using it for another week, i have to say that my skin looks a lot better, much smoother than it has for a long time.  But!!!  It still doesn&#x27;t feel smooth.....  i will continue using this product because it does help my skin to look better.....  as a side note; this product seems to sit on top of the skin rather than be absorbed into it.......</li>
    <li> this stuff is great.  I could feel a differnce the first time i used.</li>
    <li> I have kp on my arms and I have suffered from it for years.  I have been using this lotion for 2 weeks and notice my skin overall is smoother.  I knew it won&#x27;t cure kp but I feel good to have smoother skins. Will continue to use it and hope will get even better!</li>
    <li> Wow, I believe this actually works on my rough  skin....thick, rich, and seems to take care of the skin imperfections.</li>
    <li> I saw a commercial on TV for this &amp; had to try it. I have a bumpy patch on the back of my neck &amp; upper back and on the under side of  my arms from the elbow up.</li>
    <li> It leaves my skin a little sticky</li>
    <li> Bag Balm did a better job.</li>
    <li> My daughter has rough bumpy skin on her arms and she recommended this. Works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it works , but it does.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 10 stars I would!!!  I bought this on a whim for my rough dry hands that are always in water and chemicals, I started using it on my face too and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much more even my skin tone was getting (I have acne prone skin that tends to get dark spots)...even the fine lines around my face are significantly smoother too!!!  What I like about it also is that there aren&#x27;t any toxic chemicals in it. I bought mine at Target for a lot less than what Amazon sells it for.</li>
    <li> I love this product but I think I can buy it cheaper elsewhere!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! Good for smoothing feet or bumpy upper arms or legs in one or two uses.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it came very fast, saved me from having to search in stores</li>
    <li> I had this in my wish list and kept putting it off. I bought it at a local Walgreens on a whim and am glad I did. I always tried to use very hydrating lotions like aquaphor or eucerin but they never absorbed. This gold bond lotion is light and absorbs and smooths your skin immediately. I will keep this in stock in my cabinet. It also doesn&#x27;t have the smell that amlactin has.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin. Instead, it leaves a sticky film that I can rub partway off and have to wash the rest of the way off.</li>
    <li> This cream works excellently!  I have mild KP and have always wanted to get my arms smoother and clearer in appearance.  After using this cream for a week or so I could already tell a difference.  Now I just apply it here and there to maintain.  Great product, you won&#x27;t regret buying it!  I would heed the advice I&#x27;ve seen other reviewers leave though - purchase it elsewhere if you want a cheaper price. I&#x27;ve seen it for I believe $9-10 at Target.</li>
    <li> Greatly overpriced here, found for about $10.00 at the supermarket.  It seems to work well, smoothing my rough, dry elbows.  Smells awful, though.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for anything heavily perfumed and unscented would have been fine, but this has a very unpleasant smell so I use it only at night.</li>
    <li> This is advertised as &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;. Uh, NO. This has to be the nastiest smelling cream I have ever used. It&#x27;s heavy chemical odor that doesn&#x27;t go away, even after washing my hands repeatedly. It worked quite well on my very dry skin, but the smell is so bad I cannot continue to use it. Too bad. Gold Bond might consider some consumer testing before they put their creams on the market. Seems to me I had to toss a tube of their cream hand sanitizer a few years ago for the same reason: horrendous chemical odor that lingered for days.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! Troubled by bumps on back of my arms for more years than i can count but this stuff really helps!</li>
    <li> love this - works just as they say - big difference in my rough spots within an hour and continues to work well - will be back for more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week now as well as a mango sugar scrub and between the two I&#x27;ve had drastic results.  For years I have had pretty bad KP and was so embarrassed I wouldn&#x27;t even wear short sleeve shirts. When I heard about this product I immediately had to try it. I know over $10 is a little expensive for some people but honestly I was SOOOO worth it for me. I will say it doesn&#x27;t smell the best (but most KP products don&#x27;t), as well as it leaves a slightly tacky feeling on your skin. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best to apply a very thin layer on your skin at night before I go to bed. Trust me a little of this stuff goes a long way. If anybody else has been embarrassed for years about their skin this is the thing to get!</li>
    <li> I have bumps on my arms and I have been using this for about two weeks.  So far I have noticed a slight change in the bumps, but I am only applying once a day.  I think if I were more diligent, I would see more results.  My arms feel a lot smoother too.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter a week ago becuase hr arms are realy bumpy. After the second day of using this, her arms were less bumpy and really smooth. Extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff does exactly what it says it does.  With just a couple days of use, I saw a GREAT improvement to my rough, dry spots.  I&#x27;ve had eczema my whole life and short of only one prescription cream, this has been, by far, the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: I hate the smell.  I think that mixing in a tad bit of essential oil might mask that a bit, though.  Also, don&#x27;t use it on any raw skin.  Definitely has a sting!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I seen this product advertised as I have severe kp on my entire arms and it can be really embarrassing. I have tried everything under the sun for my condition and it will not go away at all. So let me start by saying I decided to use this once daily for 2 months before reviewing. At 2 months after using daily I see very very little improvement. The only thing it has done is make my arms feel smooth but they r still just as red and dotty as before :/.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes but no luck I sure wish there was a cure I would pay thousands to get rid of this red bumpy skin.</li>
    <li> this product is A1 - I know I&#x27;ve rated a lot of purchased products as loving each and every one, but this particular item is a miracle.  I love it and will continue to purchase - great item</li>
    <li> I really like it....I wish I could get it here at my drug store in Rothesay N.B. Canada.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had KP on my thighs and upper arms for about 15 years. I thought I would be stuck with it forever. I tried this product and I saw a difference overnight. Redness and bumps had gone down dramatically. this product is amazing and I never want to be without it again.</li>
    <li> What do you know, a product that actually works. I have had KP on my upper arms since I was a kid-I hate these bumps, thought they were pimples when I was younger and was mortified to have people see my arms. I have tried exfoliating and other creams, but short of a cycle of heavy duty antibiotics for a cat bite, nothing cleared this up. This cream starts working right away, after a week the bumps are almost completely gone.</li>
    <li> I have keratosis palaris (sp ?), on my upper arms, this does some nice work Tamming the bumps even with this dry winter! Definitely try on those dry patches!</li>
    <li> AMAZING! The best product I&#x27;ve ever used for dry, rough, bumpy skin. I could tell the difference on the second day and by the end of the first week, my skin was baby smooth again. I no longer use it daily and my skin feels as smooth and soft on the third day as the first. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> First off, this is cheaper in stores than on Amazon. But i won&#x27;t recommend it regardless. I&#x27;ve had keratosis pilaris for a while and I&#x27;ve had success with lotions that have alpha hydroxy acid in them.. Some of which have been kind of procey. I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try though. I&#x27;m now thinking of throwing it away. As other reviewers have noted, it leaves a sticky film/residue that you can rub off. I discovered this on accident and it grosses me off. KP is dead skin cell build up. How can this help my KP when it feels like nasty build up itself?? The residue grosses me out and I&#x27;ve had better results from other lotions. Namely Paul&#x27;s Choice which has been amazing and I guess something I&#x27;ll need to continue splurging on if it means my arms look and feel better to the touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with shaving bumps (especially on my legs) since the beginning of time. it&#x27;s been super frustrating, I&#x27;ve tried scrubs and all sorts of lotions to no avail, usually just covering up in the summer. Without ever being diagnosed with Eczema or KP, I still gave this a shot and it has done a really good job at clearing up the bumps in the week that I&#x27;ve used it. There still are spots here and there but they&#x27;re fading fast. I put this on then cover it in knee-high socks to sorta lock-in the treatment at night, then in the morning there is a noticeable difference. definitely recommend this</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> a little to sticky for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve made something of a hobby of trying and reviewing &amp;#34;cures&amp;#34; for keratosis pilaris. Of everything I&#x27;ve tried so far, this has worked the best. Yup, even better than Amlactin. However, this smells even worse than Amlactin...as if you thought that even possible. It contains a substance called &amp;#34;urea&amp;#34;...which shares the same chemical makeup as human urine which is why it smells like urine. Since I have KP over about a third of my body and since you must apply it liberally for it to have any effect, this little tub lasts me about a month. It costs $10 at the Walmart...so $120 per year to treat this miserable problem with no end in sight. But it does work, better than anything yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, the worst of the smell seems to fade after about six hours, so plan accordingly! Like, don&#x27;t slather it on right before a hot date or anything! Because it is a cream, you have to rub it in very thoroughly or it will just sit on the skin&#x27;s surface and be sticky. Well, it still is kinda sticky, but I&#x27;m grateful for the results anyway. We KP sufferers are a forgiving bunch...not that we have any choice!</li>
    <li> I bought this almost two weeks ago. The bumps on my arms have reduced and my arms are now very soft. I would highly recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Smooths rough skin in a few days</li>
    <li> Works like I charm on my rough &amp; bumpy patches on my upper arms.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at walmart for 9.99. I bought it because I have horribly dry skin from the wonderful winter weather and my use of antihistamines. So far it has been fantastic. I have used it on my face without a problem, it has helped greatly with my dry, flakey skin. I have used it on my feet and those don&#x27;t feel as rough either. I love that it isn&#x27;t perfumey like so many other lotions.</li>
    <li> This product works.  It really works.  I went from Alligator to Velvet in two weeks.  The only issue I have is I panic if I don&#x27;t have another jar before this one runs out.</li>
    <li> My daughter has sensitive skin. I put this on and she had a horrible reaction to it. She complained it was burning and she had a large red spot where I put the cream. I was so disappointed. Gold Bond is a great brand....wanted this cream to work but it like &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; my daughter&#x27;s cheek.</li>
    <li> Item came broken and product looked used? Waste of my money</li>
    <li> I used it for a month and there was no change at all.</li>
    <li> So far I don&#x27;t see a big difference, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is miracle cream. Seriously. I use this every other day after showering and those annoying red bumps on the backs of my legs and elbows are totally gone! You really don&#x27;t need much of it either, so the jar will likely last me quite awhile. The only thing I would like to change is the smell. It&#x27;s not that bad but it could be more pleasant. Definitely buying this again when I run out!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have keratosis pilaris and even the medicated lotion the doctor prescribed me didn&#x27;t take the bumps away, not to mention it felt sticky like I was smearing donut glaze on my skin! This lotion doesn&#x27;t feel sticky at all and it actually made my bumps noticeably smaller within days! It doesn&#x27;t smell very pretty but that&#x27;s a small price to pay! For the first time in my life I have smooth arms, thighs and hips! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very good at remembering to apply lotion, but I believe if I remembered to apply twice a day, I would see even more improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Does a good job of softening but has a funny urine smell.</li>
    <li> I saw a commercial for this and got sucked in immediately. I use the aloe healing hand lotion and it is literally the only lotion that works for me and IS NOT GREASY! With this product I unexpectedly noticed a difference by the end of the day. Unreal! (please note...it gives a week as a time frame).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have thick or dark body hair, but sometimes that means it&#x27;s more apt to roll in on itself on my thighs and upper arms. Both felt noticably smoother within the same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing to consider/keep in mind is that this is a lotion product out of a tub, so it is thicker and a little resistant to spreading easily. Also, it does have an &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; effect so I would avoid putting it above your collar bone! You&#x27;ll likely notice sometimes that you can brush off this&amp;#34; result&amp;#34; at some point. Similar to dead skin in the summer...that rolling effect.&lt;br /&gt;In the end I&#x27;m still super pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this product, especially if you&#x27;ve already had luck with Gold Bond in the past.</li>
    <li> Greasy. Leaves a film on your skin. I only used a few times because I felt like I needed to shower after applying. Not sure how it worked on bumps because I couldn&#x27;t stand the way it felt on my skin to give it a chance.</li>
    <li> My son has a skin disorder he&#x27;s only 6.  He hates lotion but once he started using this lotion on a regular basis and saw the difference it made he is happy to apply it   The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell I think it has an odd smell almost like crayons and it&#x27;s a little sticky.  Definitely for sensitive skin as it is a plain lotion</li>
    <li> Good product but not as thick as the GB Ultimate Healing Concentrated Skin Therapy Cream</li>
    <li> I started using this because I have KP.  I heard some good things and thought I would give it a try.  I have been using it a couple of weeks now, and I have seen a little bit of improvement.  I was hoping to see more since it has been about a month.  It has made my skin smoother and has taken the bumps on my arm down.  However, it hasn&#x27;t made them completely unnoticeable.  I know it says that it may help some skin types more than others, but I was a little disappointed that you can still tell I have bumps on my arms.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product. I have those little bumps on my upper arms that I would love to get rid of. I tried this cream everyday for two weeks straight, and it made the bumps worse! I actually got more bumps, and they turned into almost pimple like. I usually try to be positive about products I review, but I am seriously disappointed with this gold bond cream. I now have an almost full jar that I may end up just throwing in the trash. Waste of money.  UPDATE - - - I put this cream aside for a few weeks, just to see if maybe it was something else *possibly* making the bumps worse... the bar soap I was using? Well, My upper arm bumps started to ... I guess you can say heal during this time. They stopped looking rash/pimple like, and back to those just tiny white bumps.  SO... I tried the cream again. SAME disappointing results. Those tiny bumps starting turning pimple-like and multiplied again. In the end, I just ended up giving cream away to a family member.  Now it&#x27;s a few weeks later and I still have many tiny bumps on my arms. I&#x27;d have to say I really think this did more harm then help. And I usually LOVE gold bond lotions. I use their other body lotions all the time  I really regret wasting my money on this.</li>
    <li> Every thing said about this product is true,, Love it.</li>
    <li> This skin cream is great for smoothing out bumpy skin. I have Keratosis Pilaris on my thighs and butt (just being honest!) and I use this cream every night before bed. It leaves your skin with a weird sticky feeling, but that&#x27;s the nature of amlactin-type products. It does the job and my skin always feels smoother within three or four days of starting to use the product!</li>
    <li> this thing is magic. It heals kerostosis pilaris on a few weeks of use. it smells terrible but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. I use it everyday after using a homemade sugar scrub and my KP has almost completely disappeared after 3 weeks. My skin is the softest it has ever been. Thank you Gold Bond for an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Love this product, moisturizers and not greasy.</li>
    <li> AFter 2 weeks, I couldn&#x27;t tell it helped a bit so went back to the lotion I was using before.  Gave this to my mom for her feet.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and it does exactly what it says it will do.  Really smoothing out some rough, dry skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good cream  but did not do anything for my bumps.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME!  I use it on the back of my arms - no dry, bumpy, flaky skin this winter!  I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this product after reading all the glowing reviews. However, I must be one of the unlucky ones; within hours of the first use, the redness of my arms had intensified, and I experienced moderate but persistent itching. I hoped it would improve, but after 5 days of discomfort I&#x27;m discontinuing my use. I&#x27;m very disappointed! This product seems to be very effective for many people, but I, at least, have reacted badly to it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sticky for a couple of minutes and it doesn&#x27;t smell pretty, but it works. My arm bumps are basically gone after six weeks of use. I&#x27;ve used other products that cost three times more and didn&#x27;t do much. Yay!</li>
    <li> I started using this cream just under 3 weeks ago and I noticed a big difference within a week or so. I use mine on my temples for the rough and bumpy skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Helped my girlfriends keratosis pilaris! Great product</li>
    <li> a little thick when on but works well!</li>
</ol>
